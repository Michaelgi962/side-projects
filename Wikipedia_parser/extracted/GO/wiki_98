West Albany, Albany, Oregon

West Albany is a neighborhood of Albany, Oregon, United States. It includes the Fir Oaks subdivision.
Fir Oaks.
Established in 1948, the Fir Oaks Addition is a subdivision situated near Liberty Elementary School in the West Albany area of Albany, Oregon, United States. Its property includes 27th and 28th Avenue, Park Terrace SW, Lawnridge SW and part of Lakewood Drive. Guidelines for home development and ownership were laid out in the Fir Oaks Addition Charter. It mandated strict requirements to create a neighborhood affordable only for wealthy Albany residents. Developers chose the Ranch-style house as their common design module. Yet, these homes were not the regular 1000 square foot box plans that dominated domestic architecture during this post-WWII period. They were larger versions, of the Split-Level Ranch, Raised Ranch or California Ranch styles that offered more square footage. 
In the 1960s, new home owners in Fir Oaks chose new customized designs that differed from the Ranch-style. These new designs filled up the vacant lots among the neighborhood’s existing Ranch-style homes. The last lot was sold in the mid-1970s.
History.
Rural country.
In 1945, Albany's city boundary extended from the downtown region along the Willamette River out toward 10th street. The area surrounding it, known as "rural country," was farmland. A farm located south of the Bureau of Mines became the new property for the Fir Oaks Addition in 1948. Owned by John Elbert Elder and his wife Beatrice, the lot included land around Oak Creek and the land located westward near the creek's end at the Calapooia River. Not much is known about the Elder family. A small creek off of Oak Creek and a house located in Albany's Monteith Historic District carry the name of Cathey Elder after one of their decedents; city records provide nothing else.
Charter.
The Fir Oaks Addition Charter of 1948 is an example of charters written for housing developments created to segregate race and social classes. The major requirements laid out by the Fir Oaks Addition Charter are listed below:
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average home in Oregon cost $8,500 in 1950 while the Fir Oaks Addition Charter required $12,500 or more for homes. The average annual cost of living for the state was $3,000. The higher cost creates a limitation then for owners who did not have an income higher than the state average. 
In 1914, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. adopted deed restrictions to prohibit Mexican-Americans from becoming owners in his development of Spanish colonial houses located in Palos Verdes, California. Later in 1923, developer J.C. Nichols built a Country Club District restricting billboards and African-American owners close to Kansas City. This form of "exclusivity" as Dolores Hayden calls it in her book Building Suburbia, she claims was common among developers, especially in the 1950s. The industry boom, after WWII in 1946, produced a consumer culture that wanted everything to be bigger and better. White-collar and upper-middle-class families wanted to live in big houses among prosperous neighbors, developers helped to make this so. 
One of the families that lived in the Fir Oaks Addition was the Ralston family. Their family owned Ralston Motor Company along Lyon Street in downtown Albany. The Ralstons bought two homes in Fir Oaks, one on 3210 Park Terrace and the other on 2710 Park Terrace. City records indicate that Josephine Ralston, mother of Rolla and Robert Ralston and joint partners of the family’s new and used car business, was one of the first residents in Albany to have a telephone installed in her home. 
Many original owners or their immediate descendents still reside in the Fir Oaks Addition, according to the 2000 census, meaning that the neighborhood has remained predominantly Caucasian.

Anthony Robles

Anthony Robles (born July 20, 1988) is a wrestler who won the 2010-11 NCAA individual wrestling championship in the 125-pound weight class despite being born with only one leg. He is the author of the book "Unstoppable: From Underdog to Undefeated: How I Became a Champion" (Gotham Books), which went on-sale September 27, 2012.
Youth.
Robles was born with one leg for unknown reasons, but refused to wear a prosthetic leg, removing it at the age of 3. Due to his leg's being missing all the way up to the hip, he has no stump to attach a prosthetic limb to. He endeavored to work around his missing leg, strengthening his body with various exercises. When Robles was in the sixth grade, he set a record for the most pushups by a member of his school. He began wrestling in the eighth grade, joining in while watching one of his older cousins practice. As a freshman in high school Robles had a record of 5-8 and ranked last in the city of Mesa, Arizona, disadvantaged by being 10 pounds underweight for his weight class. Robles benefited, however, from tremendous grip strength from his use of crutches. After intensive training Robles found that he could use his unusually low center of gravity to defend against attack, and became skilled at several offensive moves including one he created. In his sophomore year Robles was ranked sixth in Arizona, and won two state wrestling championships going 96-0 in his junior and senior years combined at Mesa High School. Robles won a national championship as a senior, finishing his high school wrestling career with a record of 129-15.
Future.
Robles has stated that he wanted to become a motivational speaker, specifically for those who face similar challenges.
Awards and honors.
In January 2012, Robles was presented the 2011 Most Courageous Athlete Award by the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association.

<doc id="31236505" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31236505" title="Attributional ambiguity">
Attributional ambiguity

Attributional ambiguity is a psychological attribution concept describing the difficulty that members of stigmatized or negatively stereotyped groups may have in interpreting feedback. According to this concept, members of groups that often experience social stigma find it challenging to determine whether feedback is based upon their actual behavior or membership in a stereotyped stigmatized group. This can lead stigmatized group members to feel uncertainty about whether negative outcomes are due to discrimination against them or their own behavior. In comparison, they might discredit positive feedback as a form of sympathy rather than seeing it as the result of their ability and achievement. The term was coined by Jennifer Crocker, Brenda Major and their colleagues.
Implications.
Attributional ambiguity can have unfortunate repercussions for members of stigmatized groups. Members of groups that are ‘stereotype-vulnerable’ or are often stereotyped are at greater risk of having less self-worth through the lens of attributional ambiguity. With this concept, when people of an often stigmatized group receive feedback, they are unsure what the basis is for that feedback and believe it could have been attributed to things other than performance alone. Whether it is positive or negative feedback they face uncertainty about how accurate that feedback was and thus feeling uncertain about how to interpret the responses.
In the absence of true feedback one cannot totally rely on that evaluation and thus cannot adjust their behavior or performance accordingly. Attributional ambiguity can be applied in a very broad sense, considering how often people seek feedback. In academics, athletics, relationships, etc. are all areas in which feedback can be pivotal. For example, if it is known that a manager is very sensitive to his/her subordinates’ feelings, and he/she gives positive feedback, it is unclear if that feedback was true or simply an action of sensitivity.
Empirical support.
In an experiment conducted by Jennifer Crocker, Brenda Major and colleagues, women who were evaluated unfavorably by a blatantly prejudiced evaluator experienced less negative affect than women who were rated unfavorably by an unbiased evaluator. With African American participants, it was found that when reviewed negatively African Americans were more likely to attribute the evaluator's negativity to prejudice than were white participants. Furthermore, African Americans were likely to attribute both negative and positive reviews to prejudice if they could be seen by the evaluator. Being visible (and thus vulnerable to being stereotyped based on race) helped African Americans cope with negative reviews, but also made them more likely to discredit positive reviews.
The same concept can be applied not only to race, ethnicity, gender, etc., but appearance as well. To the extent to which one views his/herself as attractive can affect how they perceive feedback. A study by Major, Carrington & Carnevale (1984) found that, as described above, the attractive participants were less likely to believe positive feedback given to them, believing that the observer had an ulterior motive. When the observer could see the attractive participant, they doubted the true motive behind their positive feedback. Unattractive participants were more likely to believe positive feedback than were attractive participants. When an ulterior motive is possible, it is easier to discount the feedback whether it is positive or negative. (see also Lookism)
C. L. Hoyt and colleagues examined attributional ambiguity in Latino subjects as compared to white subjects. They found that when given a negative review Latino subjects were more likely to attribute this negativity to the prejudice of the examiner than white subjects. They also found that when given a positive review, Latino subjects were more likely to discredit the positivity of the reviewer and experience a lower sense of well being than their white counterparts. This research suggests that while attributional ambiguity can be used as a buffer to protect the self from negative reviews and biased thoughts, it can also prevent stigmatized groups from embracing reviews

Tübingen–Horb railway

The Tübingen–Horb railway is a railway line in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, continuing the Neckar-Alb Railway from Tübingen to Horb. Historically the line from Plochingen to Rottweil, including the Neckar-Alb line and part of the line now called the Gäu Railway was known as the "Upper Neckar Railway" ().
History.
The original Upper Neckar Railway opened from Plochingen to Reutlingen in 1859. It was extended via Tübingen to Rottenburg in 1861. The next section from Rottenburg to Eyach was opened in 1864 and the last section from Eyach to Horb was opened in 1866. Historically, the Upper Neckar railway included the section of line between Plochingen and Tübingen, now called the Neckar-Alb Railway.
Passenger operations.
Regionalbahn services are operated on the line by DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee (RAB), a subsidiary of DB Regio, together with the Nagold Valley Railway as part of the "Kulturbahn" (“culture railway”). Between Tübingen and Rottenburg services run at half hour intervals. Services run approximately hourly on the line to Horb, in order to connect with InterCity services to and from Zurich and Regional-Express trains to and from Singen. The line is operated with diesel multiple units of class 611 and class 650.3.
Freight operations.
In the morning of one to two work days per week, trains of the Hohenzollern Landesbahn (HzL) run on the line from Tübingen freight yard, carrying scrap and timber to Mengen. In Eyach the train runs on to HzL’s own line, the Eyach–Hechingen railway. These trains are hauled by MaK V 100 PA locomotives.
Between Eyach and Horb there is no regular freight traffic any more. All sidings of the line are closed down and/or blocked off. For example, the Rottenburg freight yard was redeveloped years for a new bus station.
Planning.
For several years it has been planned to establish new or reactivated stations on the Tübingen–Rottenburg section, including at Buhl, Kilchberg and Weilheim. However, this would require sections of double track. The electrification of the line has been discussed on several occasions as a diversion route for the Gäu Railway between Horb and Stuttgart.
For several years discussion have been under way on plans to integrate the line with the Neckar-Alb Railway line, together with other regional lines (Ammer Valley Railway, Erms Valley Railway, Swabian Alb Railway and the Zollernalb Railway), into the Neckar-Alb Regional Stadtbahn on the Karlsruhe model. This would require electrification of the lines. Because of the general financial situation, however, implementation is not currently in sight.
It is planned in the long run to integrate train control technology on the line, along with the Nagold Valley Railway and the Zollernalb Railway, with the regional electronic interlocking in Freudenstadt.

The three major program they have created to accomplish these goals include: the Political Exchange Program, the Global ThinkNet policy research and dialogue programs, and the CivilNet program to strengthen civil society and philanthropy. Many of their programs are coordinated with their U.S. affiliate JCIE/USA and other international organizations.
They also host the Shimoda Conferences. While hosting dialogues on policies, the JCIE does not hold policy related positions themselves. Policy Innovations describes the JCIE as "one of the few truly independent think tanks" in Japan's international affairs. At the last Shimoda Conference Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs commented that since their founding the Japan Center for International Exchange "has played an enormous role in enhancing mutual understanding and exchange between Japan and other countries." 
The Japan Center for International Exchange alongside the Japan Society have been leading fundraising efforts in Japan in response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The fund operated by the JCIE is called the Japan NGO Earthquake Relief and Recovery Fund. Their website alongside save-the-children.org and japansociety.org/earthquake was reported to be one of the three most recommended websites to donate to from organizers of the relief efforts.

Peacock Park

Peacock Park is a public, urban park in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, Florida on the shore of Biscayne Bay.
History.
Among the first permanent settlers in South Florida were grocers Charles and Isabella Peacock who arrived in Coconut Grove encouraged to establish a hotel. Their hotel, built in 1883, was called Bay View House and was the first hotel on mainland Florida south of Palm Beach. Later renamed the Peacock Inn, the first community gatherings in Miami were held at Peacocks'. Some visitors to the inn stayed in the area and this was the beginning of Coconut Grove, South Florida's first mainland community. Closing in 1902, the Peacock Inn building became the Lake Placid School until the school moved to Pompano Beach in 1925 The building was torn down in 1926. Later the property became a city park. After the hotel closed in 1902 Ralph Munroe established Camp Biscayne nearby so there would be a place for visitors to stay.
The city of Miami purchased the private property in 1934 for $63,500 ($ adjusted for current inflation) and established it as the public Coconut Grove Bayfront Park, renamed in honor of the aforementioned Peacocks in 1973. Considered the Miami equivalent of the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York, during the 1960s the park and surrounding Coconut Grove area became notable as a center for hippies and the youth counterculture, hosting several be-ins and concerts during the latter part of the decade. Nearby Dinner Key hosted a now-infamous Doors concert where lead singer Jim Morrison allegedly exposed himself in 1969.
Park amenities include a baseball field, basketball court, tennis court, playground, and skatepark. The adjacent Kenneth M. Myers Park, which hosts the Coconut Grove Sailing Club, is jointly administered by the city with Peacock Park. The Dinner Key Marina complex is located immediately along the shore of the park.

Forge River (New York)

Forge River is a partially mixed estuary on the south shore of Long Island in the township of Brookhaven, Suffolk County, New York.
Course.
Forge River is the major tributary of Moriches Bay, a part of Long Island’s south shore bay system that is protected from the Atlantic Ocean by outer barrier islands. The river is a remnant stream bed cut through the southerly sloping glacial out-wash plain deposited during the Wisconsin glaciation that ended some 20,000 years ago. The stream valley flooded as sea level rose.
It now functions as a small estuary. Circulation in the river is complex and is driven by a variety of forces including the tides, water column density structure, groundwater discharge, stream flow, and wind.
The tidal portion of the river is 3.2 nautical miles long that ends abruptly at Montauk Highway which serves as a dam between the river towns of Mastic and Moriches New York.
Two freshwater ponds (East Mill Pond and West Mill Pond) continuously discharge to the tidal Forge at this location. The surface watershed of the river is 43.06 km2 (10.641 acres). About 20 percent of the watershed is in the deep groundwater recharge zone.
The river is shallow throughout and has been historically so. The mean depths in much of the center of the river, were about (4-4.5 ft) at mean low water. The centerline, mean depth, based on the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS) survey of 2007-2008, is(4.9- 6.6 ft). The depth now is slightly deeper in some locations than indicated on the previous surveys because a 70-m-wide (75-yd-wide) channel has been dredged to a design depth of 2.1 m (7 ft).
Tributaries of the river including Wills Creek, Poospatuck Creek, Lons Creek,and Home Creek on the west side of the Forge have been dredged as well.
The depths in these creeks can be as great (6.6 ft). A sill has built up at the mouths of these tributaries so that each one acts as a small basin in which circulation is limited. The same is true for Old Neck Creek on the east side of the river.
The upland community of the William Floyd Estate provides habitat for breeding American woodcock (Scolopax minor) and a variety of migrating and nesting songbirds, while adjacent tidal areas afford habitat for nesting American bittern (Botarus lentiginosus), seaside sparrow, and osprey. This area is one of the few remaining sites on the south shore of Long Island where tidal wetlands are contiguous with an undeveloped upland buffer.
Duck farming off the river.
The impairment of Moriches Bay was linked with the growth of the duck ranching industry decades earlier along the Forge and other tributaries of region. Duck farm activities were identified as a primary source of pollution to Moriches Bay in several studies conducted by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) investigators between 1950 and 1959
One of several measures used to attribute duck ranching with intense pollution problems was the unusually high amounts of duck-derived phosphorus in waters proximate to duck farming sites.
The last of the farms, the Jurgielewicz Duck Farm founded in 1919.. closed in August 2011 after declaring bankruptcy. At its peak the 65 acre farm which was a landmark on the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road claimed to be America's largest free-range duck operation, raising 1 million Pekin ducks a year.

Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)

The Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) was the governmental body that ruled Somalia for most of the period from 1969-1991.
History.
Establishment.
On October 15, 1969, while paying a visit to the northern town of Las Anod, Somalia's then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d'état on October 21, 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition — essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.
Alongside Barre, the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) that assumed power after President Sharmarke's assassination was led by Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Chief of Police Jama Korshel. Kediye officially held the title of "Father of the Revolution," and Barre shortly afterwards became the head of the SRC. The SRC subsequently renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic, arrested members of the former civilian government, banned political parties, dissolved the parliament and the Supreme Court, and suspended the constitution.
Functions and political programme.
Following the 1969 coup d'état, the Supreme Revolutionary Council took over all the duties of the President, the National Assembly and the Council of Ministers through the proclamation of the Law Number 1. Essentially a military junta, the SRC became the de facto executive organ of the new state and consisted of 25 almost exclusively military officials. The old constitution nominally remained under perpetual suspension until the SRC later repealed it in 1970.
The revolutionary army established large-scale public works programs, including construction of the Mogadishu Stadium. It also sought to improve the social position of women, using Islamic precepts as a reference point. In addition to a nationalization program of industry and land, the new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia's traditional and religious links with the Arab world, eventually joining the Arab League (AL) in 1974.
The Supreme Revolutionary Council also attempted to resolve the outstanding issue of which of the various writing systems then in use in Somalia should be officialized as the main national orthography. In October 1972, the government unilaterally elected to use the modified Latin script of the linguist Shire Jama Ahmed for writing Somali instead of the Arabic or Osmanya scripts. It subsequently launched a large urban and rural literacy campaign designed to ensure the orthography's adoption, which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate.
The SRC further enacted a number of reforms designed to weaken the influence of traditional lineage structures and processes, which Barre regarded as a potential threat to his rule. Offences deemed clan-related were punished with fines and prison sentences, and traditional headmen employed by the previous civilian administration were substituted with hand-picked government peacekeepers ("nabod doan"). Orientation centers were likewise established, which took over hosting duties for marriage services. Over 140,000 nomadic pastoralists were also resettled in littoral towns and agricultural areas with the additional aim of increasing productivity.
Dissolution and reinstatement.
In July 1976, Barre's SRC disbanded itself and established in its place the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party (SRSP), a one-party government based on scientific socialism and Islamic tenets. The SRSP was an attempt to reconcile the official state ideology with the official state religion by adapting Marxist precepts to local circumstances. Emphasis was placed on the Muslim principles of social progress, equality and justice, which the government argued formed the core of scientific socialism and its own accent on self-sufficiency, public participation and popular control, as well as direct ownership of the means of production. While the SRSP encouraged private investment on a limited scale, the administration's overall direction was essentially socialist.
After the unsuccessful Ogaden campaign of the late 1970s, a new constitution was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a People's Assembly were held. However, Barre's Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party politburo continued to rule. In October 1980, the SRSP was disbanded, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council was re-established in its place.
Members.
The following is a list of members of the Supreme Revolutionary Council in February 1970:

La Mousmé

La Mousmé also known as La Mousmé, Sitting in a Cane Chair, Half-Figure (with a branch of oleander) was painted by Vincent van Gogh in 1888 while living in Arles, which Van Gogh dubbed "the Japan of the south". Retreating from the city, he hoped that his time in Arles would evoke in his work the simple, yet dramatic expression of Japanese art.
Height of Van Gogh's career.
At the time that Van Gogh painted this portrait he was 35 years old. Living in Arles in southern France, he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as "Harvest at La Crau" and this painting, "La Mousmé". The sunflower paintings, some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time. He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings. This is likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life. He is confident, clear-minded and seemingly content.
In a letter to his brother, Theo, he wrote, "Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle - more like music and less like sculpture - and above all, it promises color." As a means of explanation, Van Gogh explains that being like music means being comforting.
A prolific time, in less than 444 days Van Gogh made about 100 drawings and produced more than 200 paintings. Yet, he still found time and energy to write more than 200 letters. While he painted quickly, mindful of the pace farmers would need to work in the hot sun, he spent time thinking about his paintings long before he put brush to canvas.
The painting.
Inspired by Pierre Loti's novel "Madame Chrysanthème" and Japanese artwork, Van Gogh painted "La Mousmé," a well-dressed Japanese girl. He wrote in a letter to his brother: "It took me a whole week...but I had to reserve my mental energy to do the mousmé well. A mousmé is a Japanese girl—Provençal in this case—twelve to fourteen years old."
Van Gogh's use of color is intended to be symbolic. The audience is drawn in by his use of contracting patterns and colors that bring in an energy and intensity to the work. Complementary shades of blue and orange, a stylistic deviation from colors of Impressionist paintings that he acquired during his exploration in Paris, stand out against the spring-like pale green in the background. La Mousmé's outfit is a blend of modern and traditional. Her outfit is certainly modern. The bright colors of skirt and jacket are of the southern region of Arles. Regarding Van Gogh's painting of her features, his greatest attention is focused on the girls face, giving her the coloring of a girl from Arles, but with a Japanese influence. The young lady's posture mimics that of the oleander. The flowering oleander, like the girl, is in the blossoming stage of life.
Van Gogh said of portrait studies, such as La Mousmé, "the only thing in painting that excites me to the depths of my soul, and which makes me feel the infinite more than anything else."
The painting is part of the National Gallery of Art collection in Washington, D.C.

Targeted killings in Pakistan

In Pakistan, targeted killings have been a rising form of violence and have contributed to security instability in the country. They have become common and have gained attention especially in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and economic capital and also in Quetta, the capital of the southern province of Balochistan. Police and law enforcement agencies have sometimes come under criticism for their ineffectiveness in locating the perpetrators and investigating their motives. For most part, targeted killings in Karachi have been attributed to political, religious and ethnic reasons. There are speculations about the killing but no real proof has been found against any party.
Background.
Karachi is a cosmopolitan city and consists of many ethnic communities; the city's demographics play an important role in its politics. Ethnic politics have resulted in sporadic violence throughout Karachi's history, often leading to bloody conflicts. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Muslim immigrants from areas constituting modern-day India migrated in large numbers toted Muslim nation of Pakistan and became settled in Karachi, the historical capital of the Sindh province. These migrants had educated, middle-class to upper-class backgrounds and came from cultured families; they came to be known as Muhajir people ("Muhajir" meaning "immigrant"). They dominated much of Karachi's businesses, something which was resented by a portion of the province's native Sindhi people and radical Sindhi nationalists. After the breakaway of East Pakistan in 1971 and the formation of Bangladesh, Pakistan accepted a large number of Biharis (known as "Stranded Pakistanis") loyal to the country, trapped in Bangladesh and offered them citizenship. The Bihari migrants assimilated into the diverse Urdu-speaking Muhajir population. Some Bengalis in Pakistan also stayed behind. 
The Pashtuns (Pakhtuns or Pathans), originally from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, FATA and northern Balochistan, are now the city's second largest ethnic group in Karachi after Muhajirs. With as high as 7 million by some estimates, the city of Karachi in Pakistan has the largest concentration of urban Pakhtun population in the world, including 50,000 registered Afghan refugees in the city. As per current demographic ratio Pashtuns are about 25% of Karachi's population.
Karachi's status as a regional industrial centre attracted migrants from other parts of Pakistan as well, including Punjab, Balochistan and Pashtun migrants from the frontier regions. Added to this were Iranians, Arabs, Central Asians as well as thousands of Afghan refugees who came to Karachi, initially displaced by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; some of the Afghan and Pashtun migration brought along conservative tribal culture, further intensifying ethnic and sectarian violence and also giving rise to mob culture .PPP is maily responble in Karachi's Condition of law and order.
Violence.
The ethnic mix has resulted in political parties being affiliated with specific communities. For example, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) was founded for the political interests of the Muhajir people. Other social classes also formed their parties. Today, rivalry between groups has seen the rise of social and political chaos and a multiplication in target killings. Religious sectarian parties and Sunni-Shia conflict have also led to violence.

In March 2011, five days after conclusion of the investigations Igor Putin returned to the bank as a director. According to the bank he is not supposed to manage its daily operations. Igor Putin also keeps his position as a director of the AVTOVAZBANK.

David Jahson

Everald Pickersgill (born 4 November 1954), better known as David Jahson, is a Jamaican reggae singer, active since the early 1970s.
Biography.
Born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1954, Pickersgill first recorded in 1970 for Clement "Coxsone" Dodd's Studio One, but the results were only released on sound system dub plates. In 1972 he recorded "Far I" for Byron Lee's Dynamic studio, which was released on the Jaguar label, miscredited to 'David Janson' and mis-titled "For I", reaching number seven on the JBC singles chart. Feeling that Dynamic had mishandled the single, his next release was the self-produced "Child of a King", released on the Ital Lion label through Pete Weston's Micron label. In 1975 he recorded his most well-known song, "Natty Chase the Barber", using a new version of John Holt's "Ali Baba" rhythm recorded by a band including his friend Sly Dunbar at Channel One Studios and mixed at King Tubby's. The single was released by Tommy Cowan on his Arab label, miscredited this time to 'David & Jahson'. The song inspired several similarly themed singles by other artists, including Dr Alimantado's "I Killed The Barber", also using the "Ali Baba" rhythm, and Jah Stitch's "Bury The Barber". At the time, he was also working as a deejay with the 'Jah Love Muzik' sound system, and several of Jahson's singles also featured his own deejay versions on the B-side.
Jahson was also a member of the vocal group Well Pleased & Satisfied along with Jerry Baxter. He also played percussion and sang backing vocals with Inner Circle on their tour to support the "Everything Is Great" album, and members of the band backed him on his "Natty Chase the Barber" album in 1978, released on the Lewis brothers' Top Ranking label. The album also featured Sly & Robbie and was mixed by Prince Jammy.
In the 1980s he settled in the United Kingdom, continuing to record, and also releasing his old material on his own 'Pick A Skill' label. His "Natty Chase the Barber" album was pirated in the 1980s but Jahson reissued it later on Pick A Skill.

Jan Lokpal Bill

The Jan Lokpal Bill, also referred to as the Citizen's Ombudsman Bill, is an anti-corruption bill drafted and drawn up by civil society activists in India seeking the appointment of a Jan Lokpal, an independent body to investigate corruption cases. This bill also proposes improvements to the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill 2011, which was to be passed by Lok Sabha in December 2011.
The Jan Lokpal Bill aims to effectively deter corruption, compensate citizen grievances, and protect whistle-blowers. The prefix "Jan" (translation: citizens) signifies that these improvements include inputs provided by "ordinary citizens" through an activist-driven, non-governmental public consultation.
The word "Lokpal" was coined in 1963 by late Mr. L.M. Singhvi, a member of parliament during a debate.
To draw the attention of the government, a focused campaign "India Against Corruption" (IAC) was started in 2011. Anna Hazare is the head of civil society and the IAC movement. Being a foreground for Jan Lokpal campaign. Through these collaborative efforts till August 2011, IAC was able to upload the 23rd version of the Jan Lokpal Bill draft. As of January 2014, the Delhi State Government led by CM Arvind Kejriwal was preparing to adopt the Jan Lokpal Bill, but was unable to introduce it to the house, resigning moments later.
Lokpal Bill.
The Lokpal Bill was first introduced by Adv. Shanti Bhushan in 1968 and passed by the 4th Lok Sabha in 1969. But before it could be passed by Rajya Sabha, the Lok Sabha was dissolved and the bill lapsed. Subsequent versions were re-introduced in 1971, 1977, 1985, 1989, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2005 and in 2008, but none of them were passed.
In 2011, during the Parliament's Winter Session, the Lok Sabha passed the controversial Lokpal Bill, but could not be passed by Rajya Sabha due to shortage of time in the winter session of 2011. The Government tabled the Lokpal Bill in the Rajya Sabha on 13 December 2013 and the debate was adjourned till 16 December 2013. The Lokpal Bill was finally passed on 17 December 2013 in the Rajya Sabha. It was passed in the Lok Sabha on 18 December 2013.
Timeline and cost.
The Lokpal Bill has been introduced in the Parliament a total of eleven times since 1968. 
Current anti-corruption laws and organisations.
While India currently has a number of laws intended to stem corruption, supporters of the Jan Lokpal Bill have argued that the current laws are inadequate in light of the large number and size of scandals in India.
Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).
CVC has a staff strength of between 200 and 250 employees. If one went by international standards, India needs 28,500
anti-corruption staff in CVC to check corruption of 5.7 million employees.
There has been considerable delay in many cases for grant of sanction for prosecution against corrupt government officials. The permission to prosecute such officials acts as a deterrent in the drive to eradicate corruption and bring transparency in the system.
Central Bureau of Investigation.
Independent of the government and free from ministerial influence in its investigations.
Inspiration.
The bill was inspired by the Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). In the 1970s, the level of corruption in Hong Kong was seen so high, that the government created the commission with direct powers to investigate and deal with corruption. In the first instance, the ICAC sacked 119 out of 180 police officers.
Key features of proposed bill.
Some important features of the proposed bill are:
Efforts for setting up of Lokpal.
the lokpal and lokayuktaa bill,1968 was introduced in Fourth Lok Sabha in 1968.It was passed by LOk Sabha in 1968, while the Bill was pending in Rajya Sabha. the Lok Sabha was dissolved and consequently the Bill collapsed.
several times the Bill was presented in the Parliament,like in 1977, 1985, 1989, 1996, 1998,2001,- but each time,the Bill collapsed due to some reason, and couldn't come into effect.
Difference between government's and activists' drafts.
Details.
The following table details differences between the Government and activist backed versions.
Comparison SlideShow uploaded by India Against Corruption.
Governments approach about Whistleblower protection & Citizen-charter.
In a bid to narrow differences on the anti-graft legislation and provide itself some political cover against the threat of a public protest, the Government introduced Citizen's Charter and Grievance Redressal Bill 2011 or "Citizen-charter bill in 20 Dec 2011" along with the already introduced Whistleblower Protection Law or "Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Information) Bill – 2010" back in August 2011.
Responding to this move, Team Anna issued a statement that: “The government proposes to remove CBI, judiciary, citizen charter, whistle blower protection, Group C and Group D employees from the Lokpal jurisdiction. Wouldn't that reduce Lokpal to an empty tin box with no powers and functions?”. This issue remains open between Team Anna & Government.
Campaign for the Jan Lokpal Bill.
The first version of the Lokpal Bill drafted by the Government of India headed by United Progressive Alliance in 2010 was considered ineffective by anti-corruption activists from the civil society. These activists, under the banner of IAC, came together to draft a citizen's version of the Lokpal Bill later called the Jan Lokpal. Public awareness drives and protest marches were carried out to campaign for the bill. However, public support for the Jan Lokpal Bill draft started gathering steam after Anna Hazare, a Gandhian announced that he would hold an indefinite fast from 5 April 2011 for the passing of the Lokpal/ Jan Lokpal bill. The government has however accepted it.
To dissuade Hazare from going on an indefinite hunger strike, the Office of the Prime Minister directed the personnel and law ministries to see how the views of social activists can be included in the bill. On 5 April, the National Advisory Council rejected the Lokpal bill drafted by the government. Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal then met social activists Swami Agnivesh and Arvind Kejriwal on 7 April to find ways to bridge differences over the bill. However, no consensus could be reached on 7 April owing to several differences of opinion between the social activists and the Government.
Fast & agitation – Phase 1.
On 7 April 2011 Anna Hazare called for a "Jailemands. Anna Hazare also claimed that his group had received six crore (60 million) text messages of support and that he had further backing from a large number of Internet activists. The outpouring of support was largely free of political overtones; political parties were specifically discouraged from participating in the movement. The fast ended on 9 April, after 98 hours, when the Government accepted most demands due to public pressure. Anna Hazare set a deadline, 15 August, for the passing of the bill in the Parliament, failing which he would start a hunger strike from 16 August. The fast also led to the Government of India agreeing to set up a Joint Drafting Committee, which would complete its work by 30 June 2011.

Foundation of Democratic reforms lead by Dr.Jayaprakashnarayan of Loksatta has organised a round table conference on 24 April. List of Attendees.
Drafting committee.
The drafting committee was officially formed on 8 April 2011. It consisted of the following ten members, including five from the government and five drawn from the civil society. The former Minister of the Law and Justice is part of the drafting committee.
The Government's handling of the formation of the draft committee, involving the civil society in preparation of the draft Lokpal bill, was criticised by various political parties including Bharatiya Janata Party, Biju Janata Dal, Telugu Desam Party, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Communist Party of India, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (U) and Samajwadi Party.
The committee failed to agree on the terms of a compromise bill and the government introduced its own version of the bill in the Parliament in August 2011.
Fast & agitation – Phase 2.
According to Anna and his team, the Government's version of the Lokpal bill was weak and would facilitate the corrupt to go free apart from several other differences. To protest against this, Anna Hazare announced an "Indefinite Fast" (not to be confused with "Fast until death"). Anna and his team asked for permission from Delhi Police for their fast and agitation at Jantar Mantar or JP Park. Delhi Police gave its permission with certain conditions. These conditions were considered by team Anna as restrictive and against the fundamental constitutional rights and they decided to defy the conditions. Delhi Police imposed Sec 144 CrPC.
On 16 August, Anna Hazare was taken into preventive custody by Delhi Police. Senior officers of Delhi Police reached Anna Hazare's flat early in the morning and informed him that he could not leave his home. However, Hazare turned down the request following which he was detained.Anna in his recorded address to the nation before his arrest asked his supporters not to stop the agitation and urged the protesters to remain peaceful.Other members of IAC – Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi, Kumar Vishwas and Manish Sisodia – were also taken into preventive custody. Kiran Bedi described the situation as resembling a kind of Emergency (referring to the State of Emergency imposed in 1975 by the Indira Gandhi Govt.).
The arrest resulted in a huge public outcry and under pressure, the government released him in the evening of 16 August. However, Anna Hazare refused to come out of jail, starting his indefinite fast from Jail itself. Manish Sisodia explained his situation as, "Anna said that he left home to go to JP Park to conduct his fast and that is exactly where he would go from here (Tihar Jail). He has refused to be released till he is given a written, unconditional permission". Unwilling to use forces owing to the sensitive nature of the case, the jail authorities had no option but to let Anna spend the night inside Tihar. Later on 17 August, Delhi Police permitted Anna Hazare and team to use the Ramlila Maidan for the proposed fast and agitation, withdrawing most of the contentious provisions they had imposed earlier. The indefinite fast and agitation began in Ramlila Maidan, New Delhi, and went on for around 288 hours ( days from 16 August-2011 to 28 August-2011). Some of the Lokpal drafting committee members became dissatisfied with Hazare's tactics as the hunger strike went on for the 11th day: Santosh Hegde, a member of Hazare team who headed the Karnataka Lokayukta, strongly criticised Hazare for his insistence of ""having his way"", concluding “"I feel I am not in Team Anna any more by the way things are going. These (telling Parliament what to do) are not democratic things."” Swami Agnivesh, another central figure in the Hazare group also distanced himself.
Notable supporters and opposition.
In addition to the activists responsible for creating and organising support for the bill, a wide variety of other notable individuals have also stated that they support this bill. Spiritual leaders Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and Yog Guru Ramdev expressed support. Notable politicians who indicated support for the bill include Ajit Singh and Manpreet Singh Badal as well as the principal opposition party, Bharatiya Janta Party. In addition, numerous Bollywood actors, directors, and musicians publicly approved of the bill.
Notable opposition to the activists' version of the Bill was expressed by HRD minister Kapil Sibal and other Congress leaders; Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamta Banerjee; Punjab Chief Minister and Akali Dal leader Prakash Singh Badal; Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, and former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Jagdish Sharan Verma. Although Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) showed their support earlier, there were reports that BJP shared Congress's concern "over letting the civil society gain the upper hand over Parliament in lawmaking". The All-India Confederation of SC/ST Organisations, representing the Dalits and backward castes, also expressed opposition to the bill proposed by Anna Hazare as well as to the government's version of the bill. The confederation opposed Hazare's proposed bill saying that it will be above the constitution and that proposers of the bill have support from elements who oppose reservation.
Logjam of Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill 2011.
On 27 December 2011, Lok Sabha Parliament winter session passed controversial Lokpal Bill under title of Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill 2011, but without constitutional status. Before passing this bill it was introduced in Lok Sabha with key amendments moved. The 10-hour house debate, number of opposition parties claimed introduced bill is weak and wanted it withdrawn. Key amendments that were discussed but defeated were following:
Amendments that the house agreed upon were:
Team Anna rejected the proposed bill describing it as "anti-people and dangerous" even before the Lok Sabha gave its assent. The key notes Team Anna made about rejection were:
Team Anna was also disappointed over following inherent exclusions within tabled government bill.
This bill was then presented in Rajya Sabha where it hit log jam again.
Criticisms of the Jan Lokpal Bill.
Naïve approach.
The bill has been criticised as being naïve in its approach to combating corruption. According to Pratap Bhanu Mehta, President of the Center for Policy Research Delhi, the bill "is premised on an institutional imagination that is at best naïve; at worst subversive of representative democracy". The very concept of a Lokpal concept has received criticism from Human Resource Development minister Kapil Sibal in that it will lack accountability, be oppressive and undemocratic.
Extra-constitutional.
Kejriwal rejects the claim of Lokpal being extra-constitutional with the explanation that the body will only investigate corruption offences and submit a charge sheet which would then tried and prosecuted through trial courts and higher courts, and that other bodies with equivalent powers in other matters exist. The proposed bill also lists clear provisions for the Supreme Court to abolish the Lokpal.
Despite these clarifications, critics feel that the exact judicial powers of Lokpal are rather unclear in comparison with its investigative powers. The bill requires "...members of Lokpal and the officers in investigation wing of Lokpal shall be deemed to be police officers". Although some supporters have denied any judicial powers of Lokpal, the government and some critics have recognised Lokpal to have quasi-judicial powers.
The bill also states that "Lokpal shall have, and exercise the same jurisdiction powers and authority in respect of contempt of itself as a High court has and may exercise, and, for this purpose, the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (Central Act 70 of 1971) shall have the effect subject to the modification that the references therein to the High Court shall be construed as including a reference to the Lokpal." Review of proceedings and decisions by Lokpal is prevented in the bill by the statement "...no proceedings or decision of the Lokpal shall be liable to be challenged, reviewed, quashed or called in question in any court of ordinary Civil Jurisdiction.". As a result, how the trials will be conducted is unclear in the bill, although the bill outlines requiring judges for special courts, presumably to conduct trial that should be completed within one year. The critics hence express concern that, without judicial review, Lokpal could potentially become an extra-constitutional body with investigative and judicial powers whose decisions cannot be reviewed in regular courts.
Scope.
The matter of whether the Indian Prime Minister and higher judiciary should or should not be prosecutable by the Lokpal remains as one of the major issues of dispute. Anna's own nominee for co-chairing the joint panel Justice Verma, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, has expressed his constitutional objections for including the Prime Minister and higher judiciary under Lokpal. According to him, "this would foul with the basic structure of the constitution".
Criticism from the Director of CBI.
The CBI in a presentation before the Standing Committee of the Parliament, has strongly argued against the vivisection of the CBI and merger of its anticorruption wing with the Lokpal, noting that this would seriously cripple the core functioning of the CBI and reduce it to irrelevance. An organisation built over last 60 years comprising competent professionals should not be subsumed under Lokpal. CBI officers concede that in some sensitive political cases there is of course interference from the government, but in respect of an overwhelming majority of cases CBI functions, unfettered and uninfluenced by extraneous considerations. For this reason there is an ever increasing demand for CBI investigation from all-over the country in respect of important cases.
However, in a contradictory TOI article in August 2011, it has been revealed that one its own report says that the CBI is still finding itself waiting for a go-ahead from central agencies so that it can initiate criminal proceedings against high-ranking officials.
Support for the bill.
Surveys.
IAC conducted a survey on the draft Lokpal Bill presented by the Indian Government in Parliament. It showed that 85% of the participants were opposed to the government's bill. The team especially cited the results from the Chandni Chowk constituency, the constituency of Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal, who is a vehement voice for the government's version of the bill.
According to a nationwide survey conducted by CNN-IBN & CNBC-TV18 and published in early August, only a shade over a third of respondents have heard of Lokpal. 34% of all respondents said they have heard of the ombudsman and only 24% knew what it actually meant
Prashant Bhushan, one of Anna Hazare's associates and a drafter of the Jan Lokpal Bill, has demanded a nation-wide referendum on the Jan Lokpal Bill to gauge the mood of the nation.
Legislator support.
Post the massive support to Anna Hazare's movement, several MPs across party lines have come out in support to the Jan Lokpal Bill. Most notable are Congress MPs from Maharashtra, Priya Dutt and Datta Meghe. Datta Meghe also demanded that his party spokesperson Manish Tiwari should apologise to Anna Hazare for his uncharitable comments.
This support started coming as over 150 MPs and Ministers from different states were forced to remain confined to their houses as Anna supporters protested outside their houses. Protests were also seen outside the residence of Sheila Dixit Ex-CM of Delhi, Kapil Sibal, Pranab Mukherjee amongst others.

Raise Your Weapon

"Raise Your Weapon" is a song by Canadian electronic music producer deadmau5. It was released on May 23, 2011 as the fourth single from his fifth studio album "4×4=12". The song was written by Joel "deadmau5" Zimmerman, Cydney Sheffield and Sonny "Skrillex" Moore, and features contributing vocals from Greta Svabo Bech. Musically, "Raise Your Weapon" is a progressive house song that begins with a piano melody and Bech's vocals and ends with dubstep beat with the vocals repeated. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, with some highlighting it as a standout track from the album. It reached number 100 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, making it his first song to make an entry on the chart. It also reached number 117 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was nominated at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording, where he also performed the song in a sequence with David Guetta, Chris Brown, Lil Wayne and Foo Fighters, with the songs being "I Can Only Imagine" and "Rope." 
Critical reception.
"Raise Your Weapon" received generally positive reviews from music critics. David Jeffries from Allmusic gave the song a positive review, saying, "When the one-two punch of “Raise Your Weapon” and “One Trick Pony” introduce the Mau5’s newfound love of dubstep, you’ve got just enough variety." Will Hermes of "Rolling Stone" also gave a positive review, "The masterstroke is "Raise Your Weapon," which breaks down into a sick dubstep beat. "How does it feel now, to watch it burn?" asks singer Greta Svabo Bech before the bass hits". Dave Simpson of "The Guardian" said "Raise Your Weapon – featuring Greta Svabo Bech's soulful vocal – shows he can turn his hand to thoughtful sounds". Alex Denney of BBC Music "Raise Your Weapons lurches suddenly from vocal-led, ambient house into the dentist-drill arsenal of sounds more commonly associated with Benga". Michelangelo Matos of "The A.V. Club" gave the song a mixed review, calling Bech's verses "half-baked" and the use of dubstep "by-the-numbers".
Chart performance.
In the United Kingdom, the song charted at number 117 on the UK Singles Chart briefly after the single's release in mid-2011. In the United States, the song debuted at number 100 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 on the issue date of March 3, 2012, as well as number 11 on the Heatseekers Songs chart. It also made an entry at 93 on the Canadian Hot 100. According to Keith Caulfield of "Billboard", its latest chart entries is possibly due to a sales boost after performing at the 54th Grammy Awards along with David Guetta, Chris Brown, Lil Wayne and Foo Fighters.

No. 11 Squadron (Pakistan Air Force)

No. 11 Squadron, named the Arrows, is a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) fighter squadron assigned to the No. 38 Multi-Role Wing of the PAF Central Air Command. It operates the Block 15 model of the F-16 Fighting Falcon with a multi-role tasking and is also an Operational Conversion Unit (OCU).
The squadron crest has an arrow pointing upwards, circled by 11 stars, and symbolises the pursuit of professional excellence.
History.
The squadron was first established at 1 January 1949 at RPAF Station Mauripur as a light bomber unit. It was supposed to be equipped with the Bristol Brigand but the first aircraft crashed before arriving in Pakistan. The type's procurement was subsequently halted and the unit was disbanded in February 1949. In June 1951 the unit was restored as a fighter interceptor squadron and became the PAF's first jet squadron with the introduction of the Supermarine Attacker. First commanded by Squadron Leader A. Rahim Khan, the unit was to remain the PAF's only jet squadron until 18 January 1956 when the unit was re-equipped with the F-86F Sabre and its role changed to a Fighter Bomber squadron.
The squadron took part in the 1965 Indo-Pak War as part of the No. 33 Wing at PAF Base Sargodha (now PAF Base Mushaf). The Arrows flew 227 sorties, including Air Defence and Close Air Support missions, during the 17 day war. Ten Hawker Hunters and three Folland Gnats of the Indian Air Force were shot down during these missions, with a further three Hawker Hunters damaged. One F-86 was shot down in Indian territory during a fighter sweep mission, flown by Flying Officer Shaukat.
When sanctions and an arms embargo was placed on Pakistan by the U.S. after the war, the Arrows were re-equipped with the Shenyang F-6 in 1966 and their role changed to Air Superiority. The unit moved to PAF Base Rafiqui in January 1971, moving back to Sargodha during the 1971 Indo-Pak War. Again, the squadron flew Air Defence and Close Air Support missions during which a Sukhoi Su-7 and a MiG-21 were shot down. One of the squadron's F-6 fighters were shot down over India. After the war the squadron returned to PAF Base Rafiqui.
During these wars the Arrows were credited with the highest number of kills of any PAF squadron. In January 1983 the unit was again moved to PAF Base Sargodha and became the first squadron to re-equip with the F-16 Fighting Falcon, becoming a Multi-Role unit with introduction of the F-16A/B Block 15.
The squadron was termed as "exceptional" after an inspection by the Inspectorate team on 28 October 1991. In early 1992 an imminent threat to Pakistani nuclear facilities lead to the squadron flying missions under a national contingency plan named "Thunderbolt" from 19 February 1992. After nuclear tests by India in May 1998, the squadron was deployed on 24 May 1998 to its wartime location at a satellite base to perform day/night Air Defence Alert (ADA) duties until 28 May 1998 when the Pakistani nuclear tests were completed.

Michael Summerton

Michael Summerton (22 December 1943 - 16 June 2009) was an English actor and talent agent who began his career as one of the original Dalek operators in "Doctor Who", later forming his own talent agency, Michael Summerton Management Ltd. Born in Rochdale, part of Greater Manchester, he studied at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and had a role as Abanazer in a 1963 performance of "Aladdin" in the Royal Tunbridge Wells Opera House, which led to a 15 year-long legal battle with presiding agent, Alan Gale, over commission and the displacement of a large quantity of nose putty.
Later, he played small parts in several TV shows, including a role as a postboy in the soap opera "Compact" and, after a dry spell, a non-speaking role as a Dalek operator. Seeing this as a particularly low point in his career, Summerton joined Hazel Malone's talent agency, where he met David Bowie, who was similarly attempting an acting career, and apparently expressed cynicism in Bowie's musical abilities.
In 1970 Summerton started his own talent agency, recruiting in its heyday Noele Gordon, the dance groups Love Machine and Hot Gossip, Lesley Joseph, Sinitta, Bonnie Langford and the Beverly Sisters. He later managed several dancers and choreographers, including Debbie Astell, Les Child, Thomas Michael Voss, Arlene Phillips and Bruno Tonioli.

The Possessed (2009 film)

The Possessed is a 2009 documentary style horror film which was released to DVD in May 2009 and had its television debut in October that same year on SyFy.
Plot.
The movie is based upon the events surrounding what became known as the 'Watseka Wonder'. Using period photographs, dramatic recreations, and interviews with subject experts, it addresses what is allegedly the first well-documented and recorded spirit possession story in America of 1877, and the subsequent recorded "possessions" suffered by Lurancy.
Beginning in 2006, and using the assistance of members of the Studio Nine class of Watseka Community High School, "The Possessed" was shot on locations in Watseka, Illinois, in the actual homes of, and including interviews of, the remaining family members of Lurancy Vennum. The filmmakers included a repeat of an original 100-year-old séance, but were able to include modern measuring instruments. They also used footage of individuals themselves alleged to be possessed.
The film dramatically recreates the alleged events. After years of violent and self-destructive behavior, a young Mary Roff from Watseka, Illinois was committed to an asylum in Peoria, Illinois, and on July 5, 1865, she died. Twelve years later, a Watseka girl named Lurancy Vennum began exhibiting the same behavior as had Mary. When Asa Roff heard of the incident, and believing that the spirit of his deceased daughter Mary has possessed Lurancy, he convinced the Vennum family to not commit their own daughter. Lurancy Vennum moved in with the Asa Roff family in 1878 and lived with them for several days. There she was examined by Dr. E. W. Stevens, who wrote about the case, and upon whose journals the film was based.
Reception.
Dread Central wrote that the writers covered the entire story of Mary Roff and Lurancy Vellum within their documentary, with their having traveled to Illinois to interview topic experts, historians, and surviving family members. The reviewer wrote "I was fascinated by the documentary" but stated that the latter day claimants to being possessed did not seem believable.

Benjamin Schwarz (writer)

Benjamin Schwarz (born October 20, 1963) is an American editor and writer. From 2000 to 2013 he was literary and national editor of the American monthly magazine "The Atlantic".
He has written articles, essays, and reviews on an array of subjects—from fashion to the American South, from current fiction to the archaeology, from national security to architecture, from the history of slavery to the history of childhood, and from international economics to Hollywood.
Schwarz ran, and wrote a regular column for, the "Atlantic"'s Books and Critics department, which under his editorship expanded its coverage to include popular culture and manners and mores, as well as books and ideas. The "Los Angeles Times" wrote that Schwarz had "reshaped the venerable magazine's book section into the shrewdest, best-written and most surprising cultural report currently on offer between slick covers." The writers he recruited to the Books section included Perry Anderson, Caitlin Flanagan, Sandra Tsing Loh, Christopher Hitchens, Cristina Nehring, Joseph O'Neill, Terry Castle, Clive James, and B. R. Myers. Articles in Schwarz's section were National Magazine Award finalists or winners in the Criticism category from 2000 to 2009. The "Columbia Journalism Review" described Schwarz as "the magazine's in-house intellectual."
Before joining the "Atlantic"'s staff, Schwarz was a national correspondent for the magazine. From 1995 to 2000 he wrote a series of provocative reported articles that argued for a far more diminished global role for the United States. He also wrote a series of pieces on historical and literary subjects. From 1995 to 1998 Schwarz was the executive editor of "World Policy Journal", where his chief mission was to bolster the coverage of cultural issues, international economics, and military affairs. For several years he was a foreign policy analyst at the RAND Corporation, where he researched and wrote on American global strategy, counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and military doctrine. At RAND Schwarz wrote a widely cited and highly critical assessment of American counterinsurgency doctrine and practice. Schwarz was also a staff member of the Brookings Institution. 
He holds a B.A. and an M.A. in history from Yale, where he held the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation's Mellon Fellowship in the Humanities. Schwarz was a Fulbright scholar at Magdalen College, Oxford.
In 1999 Schwarz won the Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing from the National Book Critics Circle. He is writing a biography of Winston Churchill, to be published by Random House, and is a consulting editor at Yale University Press.

Maurice William Holtze

Maurice William Holtze, (8 July 1840 – 12 October 1923) born in Hanover, Germany, was a botanist who established Darwin's Botanical Gardens in Fannie Bay, Darwin in 1878. When he left to take charge of Adelaide's Botanic Garden in 1891, his son Nicholas was appointed curator of the Darwin Botanical Gardens in his place.
Holtze studied at Hildesheim and Osnabrück before serving an apprenticeship in Hanover, where he subsequently worked for four years in the Royal Gardens. He spent two years in the Imperial Gardens of St. Petersburg before emigrating in 1872 to Melbourne, Australia, then to Darwin, Northern Territory.
While in Darwin (then called Palmerston, later Port Darwin) he made trial plantings of a large number of tropical plants of potential economic importance: rubber, rice, peanuts, tobacco, sugar, coffee, indigo and maize. He supplied the sugarcane tubers for the Cox's (later Cox) Peninsula sugarcane venture in which B. C. DeLissa and W. H. and G. T. Bean had a large interest.
Holtze sent a large number of botanic specimens from the Darwin area and nearby islands, many of which had not been previously described, to Sir Ferdinand Mueller.
In Adelaide, succeeding the great Dr Schomburgk as curator, he did much to make the Botanic Gardens an attractive place for the general public to visit, a novel policy at the time. He established lakes populated with water-lilies and lotuses, which became quite famous.
He retired in 1917 and died at Kangaroo Island, in the home of his daughter.

Luzon Volcanic Arc

The name Luzon Volcanic Arc was first proposed by Defant et al. to describe a series of Miocene to recent volcanoes due to eastward subduction along the Manila Trench for approximately 1,200 km from the Coastal Range in Taiwan south to southern Mindoro in the Philippines. They presented representative geochemistry of a number of volcanoes along the arc and were able to show five distinct geochemical domains within the arc (Mindoro, Bataan, Northern Luzon, Babuyan, and Taiwan). The geochemistry of the segments verified that the volcanoes are all subduction related (e.g., strong Nb anomalies and calc-alkaline characteristics). Isotopes and trace elements allowed them to show unique geochemical characteristics in the north. They proposed that the geochemical variations northward (Babuyan segment) were due to the subduction of sediments derived from the erosion of continental crust (China and Taiwan). 
Subsequently, Defant et al. documented a distinct increase in Sr isotopic ratios with latitude northward. They concluded that this supported their original conjecture that the variations were due to an increasing "crustal" component in subducted sediments as the continental blocks in the north were approached (China and Taiwan). They pointed out that sediment thicknesses increased toward the north along the trench. 
Defant et al. also did a detailed paper on the geochemistry and tectonic setting of the southern Luzon arc and concluded that the geochemistry suggested that continental crust (probably from sediments) played an important role in the Macolod corridor and the Mindoro segments. They pointed out that crustal collision had occurred in the south between the North Palawan-Mindoro crustal block and suggested that sediment contamination was derived from this region. The work substantiated preliminary early isotope and trace element studies on the central Luzon arc 
Further work was done on the northern Luzon arc by McDermott et al. who found systematic variations in an assortment of isotopes with latitude not only in the lavas analyzed over the 500 km section of the arc but also in sediments along the trench. They concluded that the only way to explain the latitudinal variations was through the addition of an increasing input of terrigenous sediments toward the continental regions in the north (China and Taiwan)

Martin Miller (actor, born 1899)

Martin Miller, born Rudolph Muller (2 September 1899 – 26 August 1969) was a Moravian character actor who played many small roles in British films and television series from the early 1940s until his death. He was best known for playing eccentric doctors, scientists and professors, although he played a wide range of small, obscure rolesincluding photographers, waiters, a pet store dealer, rabbis, a Dutch sailor and a Swiss tailor. On stage he was noted in particular for his parodies of Adolf Hitler and roles as Dr. Einstein in "Arsenic and Old Lace" and Mr. Paravinci in "The Mousetrap".
Miller appeared in several notable films, including "Squadron Leader X" (1943), "English Without Tears" (1944), "The Third Man" (1949), "The Gamma People" (1956), "Peeping Tom" (1960), "55 Days at Peking" (1963), "The V.I.P.s" (1963), "The Pink Panther" (1963), and "The Yellow Rolls-Royce" (1964). His most substantial roles include George II of England in "Bonnie Prince Charlie" (1948) and Kublai Khan in "Doctor Who". In the 1960s he appeared in several ITC Entertainment cult television programmes, including "Ghost Squad", "Danger Man", "The Saint", "The Avengers" and "The Prisoner".
Early life and background.
Miller was born Rudolph Muller in the Moravian city of Kroměřížthen known as Kremsier in Austria-Hungaryon 2 September 1899. Little is known about his earlier life, but he started working as an actor in Vienna in 1925, and spent his early years as an actor mainly in theatre and cabaret in Austria and Czechoslovakia. He was a member of the Jewish League of Culture in Berlin in 1938–39. At the outbreak of World War II he fled Austria to escape the persecution of the Jews and arrived in London in March 1939 to pursue a career in the British theatre and film industry. He married Hannah Norbert, later Hannah Norbert-Miller, in 1946.
Stage career.
In 1939, Miller was a co-founder of the Viennese Theatre Club of Paddington, a "celebrated emigré cabaret and theatre", also known as Das Laterndl. The theatrical group of talented Austrian exiles, which included the likes of Fritz Schrecker and Lona Cross, became known for their sketches and plays which represented a "satirical commentary on Vienna under Nazi rule". Miller achieved fame for his parodies of Adolf Hitler, and he was asked to portray Hitler in the BBC German Service's propaganda campaign. He continued to be employed by the BBC after the war as a German-language author, actor, presenter and producer for the rest of his life. He also did much work arranging plays for the German and Austrian diaspora; for instance he arranged the production of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's "Iphigenia in Tauris" in German at Wyndham's Theatre in October 1949 in coordination with the British Goethe Festival Society. 
On stage Miller was noted in particular for his roles as Dr. Einstein in "Arsenic and Old Lace" between 1942 and 1946 and Mr. Paravinci in Agatha Christie's "The Mousetrap" at the Ambassadors Theatre from 1952, a role in which he was described as an "elderly foreigner" with a "painted face which he makes half devil, half jack-in-the-box". He worked mainly in London and New York City, and played Paravinci for over 1000 performances. 
In 1951, Miller appeared alongside Lily Hann, Alan Tilvern, Gabriel Woolf and Alfie Bass in a production of Emanuel Litvinoff's "Magnolia Street Story" at the Embassy Theatre. At the end of 1959 he appeared in the successful musical "Make Me an Offer" at the Theatre Workshop in Stratford and the New Theatre on the West End, taking "his place as the least scrupulous and the most amusing of the dealers with a somewhat lighter but entirely acceptable rendering".
Film and television career.
1940s.
Miller made his British film debut in 1940 with an uncredited role opposite George Formby in the comedy "Let George Do It". 
In 1943, Miller was cast as Mr. Krohn in Lance Comfort's World War II spy drama "Squadron Leader X" alongside Beatrice Varley and Ann Dvorak, his first major film role. Soon afterwards, he played Doctor Novotny in Harold S. Bucquet's spy film "The Adventures of Tartu", the first of many roles as a doctor. Comfort hired him again the following year to appear alongside James Mason, Lucie Mannheim and Raymond Lovell in "Hotel Reserve", a spy film set in a hotel in southern France just before World War II. He then had a small role as Schmidt in Harold French's romantic comedy "English Without Tears" (1944) alongside Michael Wilding, Margaret Rutherford and Penelope Dudley-Ward.
Miller played a morgue keeper in Vernon Sewell's 1945 thriller "Latin Quarter". The following year he had a role as Professor Hansen alongside Robert Newton in Lawrence Huntington's "Night Boat to Dublin", and portrayed a postman in Maclean Rogers's romantic drama "Woman to Woman", based on the "play" by Michael Morton. 
In 1947, he starred as a professor in Vernon Sewell's comedy "The Ghosts of Berkeley Square". The film, an adaptation of the novel "No Nightingales" by Caryl Brahms and S. J. Simon, was inspired by the reputation of the property at 50 Berkeley Square as "the most haunted house in London", and co-starred Robert Morley and Felix Aylmer. That year, Miller also portrayed Dr. Hans Tautz in Anthony Kimmins' drama "Mine Own Executioner" opposite Burgess Meredith, Dulcie Gray and Michael Shepley. "Mine Own Executioner" was entered into the 1947 Cannes Film Festival.
In 1948, Miller portrayed a police inspector in Terence Young's "One Night with You", which also featured a young Christopher Lee in a minor role.After an uncredited role as an Italian waiter at the Savoy Hotel in "The Blind Goddess" (1948), he had a substantial role as George II of England in Anthony Kimmins's biopic "Bonnie Prince Charlie" about the Jacobite Risings alongside David Niven, who portrayed Charles II. In 1949, he appeared as Tony the café proprietor in Lawrence Huntington's "Man on the Run"; a customer in Jack Warner's "The Huggetts Abroad"; Leon Stolz in Arthur Crabtree's "Don't Ever Leave Me" alongside Petula Clark and Jimmy Hanley; and had uncredited roles as black marketeer Herr Schindler in "I Was a Male War Bride" and as a headwaiter in the classic film noir "The Third Man" opposite Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten.

Jaap van Till

Jaap van Till was the Internet Infrastructure professor at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in Arnhem (NL). Before that he was professor for Corporate Networks at the Delft University (NL) and visiting prof at the University of Technology Kaunas (Lithuania). He frequently teaches at post-graduate courses and business schools, like the Institut Theseus in Nice (France) and at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and Leuven. And he lectured at Master courses (MSTM) in Arnhem (NL), Bandung, Jakarta (Indonesia) and Kumasi (Ghana).
He learned from his projects as a “Network Architect” in the corporate, laboratory and factory networks of Akzo Nobel all over Europe. Later he helped to design large corporate computer networks for businesses, government ministries, the NL NREN (national research and education network) SURFnet and the Netherlight lambda fiber optic network. He was one of the three people who launched the idea for an Internet2 testbed project for the Netherlands, now running as the GigaPort Project funded by the NL government.
His work ranges from telecom legislation and government IT policy to Internet and intranet and extranet implementations. In 1988 he was part of the team that wrote the Tele-communication Law (Wet op de Telecommunicatievoorzieningen) that replaced the Telecom Law of 1904. He is chief scientist at Tildro Research B.V. in Rhenen, NL and writes columns and blogs in TelecomMagazine, Netkwesties.nl, and ScienceGuide.nl.
Synthecracy.
He is most known for his original ideas in synthecracy, which he describes as using tele-networks to interconnect and synthesise knowledge without hierarchies to get things working and solve complex problems in the general interest. The advantage of sythecracy is shown in Van Till’s Synthecracy Network Law: V ~ N ! where V is values, and N is number of networked participants. This law gives us a much higher for V for any large value of N than either Metcalfe's law or Reed's law, resulting in herd or hive like thinking, problem solving, and decision making.

Wave disk engine

A wave disk engine or wave disk generator is a type of pistonless rotary engine being developed at Michigan State University and Warsaw Institute of Technology. The engine has a spinning disk with curved blades. Once fuel and air enter the engine, the rotation of the disk creates shockwaves that compress the mixture. When ignited, the burning mixture expands, pushing against the blades, causing them to spin. The spinning of the disk itself opens and closes intake and exhaust ports. The proposed concept was called a radial internal combustion wave rotor.
Background.
Wave rotors utilize shock waves to transfer energy between a high-energy fluid to a low-energy fluid, thereby increasing both temperature and pressure of the low-energy fluid (also called pressure wave machines or pressure exchangers).
Operational principles.
As with all heat engines, the efficiency of a wave disk engine is governed by the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides (see Carnot's theorem). Compared to a conventional piston engine (reciprocating engine), a wave disk engine works at higher peak temperature, which theoretically makes it more efficient. The design also works without a cooling system, saving weight. Compared to turbine based systems, the rotational speed and the rotor-blade temperature of the wave disk engine is lower, which creates lower stress on materials, and consequently less demanding requirements for materials, leading to cheaper manufacturing and maintenance costs. 
Earlier wave rotor implementations were mainly axial flow, where the scavenging process of returning hot compressed air back into the turbine is complex. The wave-disc engine uses a radial and circumferential flow, using centrifugal forces for scavenging. Curved channels provide greater length for the same disc diameter compared to straight channels, allowing the travel times of the waves to be tuned properly.
Current status.
The wave-disk engine has the potential for better energy efficiency compared to conventional internal combustion engine designs and can potentially save weight. Possible applications include charging batteries in hybrid vehicles, which could reduce weight by about . It promises to be up to 60% more efficient, 30% lighter, and 30% cheaper to manufacture than an equivalent conventional piston engine, and to reduce emissions by 90%.
Michigan State University and Warsaw Institute of Technology researchers claim to have a prototype wave-disk engine and electricity generator that could replace current backup generator technology of plug-in electric hybrid vehicles. The research team is led by Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering Norbert Müller and has been given $2.5 million funding from the United States Department of Energy's ARPA-E program. Müller's team hoped to have a vehicle-sized 25 kilowatt (33 hp) wave disc engine/generator ready by the end of 2011. As of January 2013, the project is looking into commercialization of the technology.

Peter Barwick

Peter Barwick (1619–1705) was an English physician and author.
Life.
He was the younger brother of John Barwick, and like him was educated at Sedbergh School, and St John's College, Cambridge, where he was a foundation scholar. He was appointed by Bishop Matthew Wren to the fellowship at St John's, in the gift of the Bishop of Ely, but could not be admitted because of the troubled times. He was driven from Cambridge by the First English Civil War.
Barwick became tutor to Ferdinando Sacheverell, of Old Hayes in Leicestershire. He returned to Cambridge in 1647 to take his M.A. degree, and studied medicine. In 1651 he was at Worcester, meeting with Charles II of England, and receiving tokens of his favour; and like his brother he was a royalist supporter. In 1655 he received his M.D. degree, and in 1657 took a house in St. Paul's Churchyard. Here he was joined by his brother John, who daily read the proscribed service of the Church of England in the presence of a few royalists. About this time Peter married a Mrs. Sayon, a merchant's widow and a kinswoman of Archbishop William Laud. He was elected fellow of the College of Physicians 26 June 1655. 
At the Restoration he was made one of the king's physicians in ordinary, and was known in his profession particularly for his treatment of smallpox and all sorts of fevers. In 1661, Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London, and the other bishops, deans, and archdeacons, met at his house, and proceeded to St Paul's Cathedral to open the first session of convocation for the revising of the "Book of Common Prayer". When the Great Plague of London broke out in 1665, he was one of the few physicians who stayed; and he is mentioned by Nathaniel Hodges in his account of the plague "Loimologia" for his services in London, while attending the daily service at the cathedral and working with the clergy there.
Though the plague could not drive him from his home, the Great Fire of London did in 1666: his house was burned down with St Paul's, and he moved to the neighbourhood of Westminster Abbey. Here he lived for many years, on good terms with his neighbour Richard Busby, doing charity work and writing. He was censor of the College of Physicians in 1674, 1684, 1687, and ‘elect’ from 26 March 1685 to 6 November 1691. In 1694 his eyesight entirely failed him, and he gave up his practice; but he lived on for eleven years and died 4 September 1705.
Works.
He supported William Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood, and he is said to have written one of the best contemporary treatises on the subject. Barwick is now remembered for his life of his brother John, the dean. He began it in 1671, writing it in Latin, chiefly, it is said, for the sake of inserting the Latin disputation which his brother wrote for his D.D. degree. To the ‘Life’ he added an appendix vindicating the royal authorship of "Eikon Basilike". The ‘Vita Joannis Barwick’ was published in 1721 by Hilkiah Bedford, who also wrote an English translation of the work published in 1724, with notes. The manuscript of the life, with papers used in it, was deposited in the library of St John's College, Cambridge.
Family.
Peter Barwick and his wife Anne had one daughter, Mary (1645-1723). On 14 Jan 1678 at Westminster Abbey, Mary married Ralph Dutton (1630-1720), who later that same year was created a baronet by Charles II (on 20 Jun 1678). Through Mary, Peter was the ancestor of the Barons Sherborne, the Earls of Lichfield, 3rd Creation, the Earls Howe, 2nd Creation and the Earls of Dartmouth.

James B. Vaught

James Benjamin Vaught (November 3, 1926 – September 20, 2013) was a United States Army General who was a combat veteran of three wars: World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In Korea he served as a company commander in the 24th Infantry Division and in 1967, in the Republic of Vietnam, on his first tour he served as the commanding officer of the 5th Battalion, 7th Cavalry. He has also played a major role in numerous United States Special Forces Operations.
Early life and military career.
Vaught grew up in Conway, South Carolina. A multi-generational native of the state, he has been identified as a direct descendant of Francis "Swamp Fox" Marion. He graduated from high school in 1943 and then was enrolled at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. During this time, with World War II being fought by Allied forces in two theaters, the Federal Government's Military Draft was altered so that college students were eligible. In 1944, Vaught was one of those drafted by the United States Army, though he was able to graduate and become a member of the Citadel's class of 1946. Now in the Army, he was commissioned and became an officer in 1945. As an officer, he served three and a half years in Germany.
Korea and Vietnam.
After World War II ended, Vaught had a relatively short stay back in the U.S. before he was sent overseas again. This time he was sent to Korea, where he was involved in the fighting against the communist forces of North Korea and China. He saw combat on several occasions after his landing at Pusan and the subsequent advance north towards the Yalu River. During this time he was injured twice. Later, in 1967 during the Vietnam War, he was sent to South Vietnam, where as the battalion commander of the 5th Battalion, 7th Cavalry, he played a key role in the liberation of Huế city during the Tet Offensive of 1968. He also helped the besieged Marines at Khe Sanh until the North Vietnamese Army retreated after failed attempts to take the base. Vaught was later injured in an auto accident which resulted in him being medevaced, in a full body cast, to Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Although the "Vietnamization" policy was thought of as a failed concept, Vaught was a proponent of the policy and was a valuable asset to it throughout his second tour of Vietnam.
Later life.
After Vietnam, Vaught continued his career with the Army and was eventually promoted to Major General, serving at The Pentagon as Director of Operations and Mobilization for the Army. Perhaps his most notable role was played during "Operation Eagle Claw", the infamous failed rescue mission of hostages in Iran, where General Vaught served as the overall Commander of the operation. When Vaught commanded the mission to rescue the hostages in Iran in 1980, eight service members died and four were injured in the operation when the helicopters on the mission collided in the remote Iranian desert. Although President Carter went on television the next day to announce the failure of the mission and to accept the blame, Congress and the Pentagon launched inquiries to determine the reasons for the tragedy. The Pentagon probe was handled by a board of three retired and three serving flag officers representing all four services; it was led by retired Adm. James L. Holloway III. The commission's report listed 23 areas "that troubled us professionally about the mission-areas in which there appeared to be weaknesses. The major criticism was of the "ad hoc" nature of the task force, a chain of command the commission felt was unclear, and an emphasis on operational secrecy it found excessive. The commission also said the chances for success would have been improved if more backup helicopters had been provided and if a rehearsal of all mission components had been held.
James B. Vaught served his final tour of duty as a Lieutenant General serving in Korea, where he was the Commanding General of the Combined US/South Korean forces. He resided in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina after his retirement in 1985.
On Feb. 8, 2012, General Vaught confronted Special Operations Commander Adm. William McRaven, over the recent increased media attention and resulting security leaks of operational procedures, surrounding Navy SEALs' following the Osama bin Laden raid and the rescue of an American hostage from Somalia. Several members of the audience quietly laughed (video link below) as Vaught chastised McRaven, whose missions were successful. Vaught was quoted as saying "get the hell out of the media." During Vaught's confrontation at the meeting of the members of the National Defense Industrial Association in Washington, D.C., the 85 year old Vaught stated, "Now back when my special operators extracted Saddam from the hole, we didn't say one damn word about it", he continued. "We turned him over to the local commander and told him to claim that his forces drug him out of the hole, and he did so. And we just faded away and kept our mouth shut." Though Vaught was long retired by the time of Saddam's capture, his reference to "his special operators" addresses Vaught's critical role in the early formation and employment of the Army's classified Special Operations Forces, for whom Vaught was a critical early advocate and higher commander during the Iran Eagle Claw/Desert One rescue mission of 1979. Special Operations Commander Adm. William McRaven politely listened to the elderly Vaught, answered the question with a reference to the PR film the "Green Berets" (not a valid analogy, given the timely leaks of operational information in recent events), and then continued on with the Q&A session.
Death.
Authorities found his body in an Horry County, South Carolina pond. While Vaught died of asphyxia due to drowning, the coroner stated that his body also showed signs of cardiac disease. He was 86.

Svoboda (newspaper)

Svoboda (in — "Liberty") is the oldest existing Ukrainian newspaper and the most widely read in the Western world.
History.
"Svoboda" was founded in Jersey City, New Jersey on 11 September 1893 by Father Hryhoriii Hrushka. It became a bi-weekly newspaper on 1 March 1894, a tri-weekly on 8 August 1914, and a daily on 3 January 1921. "Svoboda" was an important 'mouthpiece" for Ukrainians in North America, and played an important role in the discussing and solving of immigrant difficulties. Prior to the establishment of Ukrainian-Canadian periodicals (for example the "Kanadiiskyi Farmer" ("Canadian Farmer")), it was the only Ukrainian-language newspaper of any note in Canada.
Ukrainians not only in the United States and Canada, but also in Brazil, Galicia, and Bukovyna, subscribed to it. It provided a channel of communication for those of the intelligentsia concerned with "emigration" of Ukrainian peasants and life in the New World.
The Ukrainian intelligentsia, through "Svoboda", sought to prepare the peasants for an improved lifestyle, and to offer advice in regard to breaking out of the peasant mold and to conform to the ideals of European civilization. Through a program of enlightenment, "Svoboda" promoted the establishment of Ukrainian schools, the learning of Ukrainian language and history.
At one time it had a circulation of approximately 18,000, the largest among Ukrainian papers in the West.

Eucratideia

Eucratideia was an ancient town in Bactria mentioned by a few ancient writers.
It was most likely a foundation of Eucratides I who is the more important ruler of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom with the name Eucratides. Not much is known about this city and it might be just a renaming of an already existing town rather than a new foundation. Renaming of cities was a common practise in the ancient world.

Patentee locomotive

The "Patentee" locomotive was a revolutionary 2-2-2 steam locomotive type introduced by Robert Stephenson and Company in 1833, as an enlargement of their 2-2-0 "Planet" type. The wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle two powered driving wheels on one axle, and two trailing wheels on one axle provided more stability and enabled a larger firebox than the earlier 0-2-2 and 2-2-0 types.
One of the earliest examples, "Adler", the first successful locomotive to operate in Germany, was a "Patentee" supplied by Robert Stephenson and Company in component form in December 1835. Other examples were exported to the Netherlands (notably "Arend" in 1839), Russia and Italy. Another, "Le Belge", was the first steam railway locomotive built in Belgium, constructed in 1835 by John Cockerill under license from Stephenson's company. By 1838 the type had become the standard passenger design by Robert Stephenson and Company.

Nathaniel Hodges

Nathaniel Hodges M.D. (1629–1688) was an English physician, known for his work during the Great Plague of London and his written account "Loimologia" of it.
Early life.
The son of Dr. Thomas Hodges, vicar of Kensington, he was born there on 14 September 1629. A king's scholar of Westminster School, he obtained a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1646. 
In 1648 he migrated to Oxford, and was appointed by the parliamentary visitors a student of Christ Church where he graduated B.A. 1651, M.A. 1654, and M.D. 1659. 
While there he took part in the activities of the Oxford Experimental Philosophy Club.
Hodges took a house in Walbrook, London, and began practice there. He was admitted a candidate or member of the College of Physicians 30 September 1659.
The plague time.
When the bubonic plague raged in London in 1665, Hodges remained in residence, and attended all who sought his advice. During the Christmas holidays of 1664–5 he saw a few doubtful cases, and in May and June several certain cases; in August and September as many as he could see by working hard all day. He rose early, and took a dose of anti-pestilential electuary as large as a nutmeg. After transacting his household affairs he entered his consulting room. Crowds of patients were always waiting, and for three hours he examined them and prescribed, finding some who were already ill, and others only affected by fear. When he had seen all he breakfasted, and visited patients at their houses. On entering a house he had a disinfectant burnt on hot coals, and if hot or out of breath rested till at his ease, then put a lozenge in his mouth and proceeded to examine the patient.
After spending some hours in this way, he returned home and drank a glass of sack, dining soon after, usually off roast meat with pickles or other relish. He drank more wine at dinner. Afterwards he saw patients at his own house, and paid more visits, returning home between eight and nine o'clock. He spent the evening at home, never smoking, but drinking old sack till he felt thoroughly cheerful. After this he generally slept well.
Twice during the epidemic he felt as if the plague had infected him, but after increased draughts of sack he felt well in a few hours, and he escaped without serious illness. 
In recognition of his services to the citizens during the plague, the authorities of the city granted him a stipend as their authorised physician.
Later life.
The College of Physicians recognised the merit of his book, and elected him a fellow 2 April 1672. In 1682 he was censor, and in 1683 delivered the Harveian oration (not printed). When censor he gave the college a fire-engine. His practice did not continue to increase, he became poor, was imprisoned in Ludgate Prison for debt, and there died 10 June 1688. He was buried in St Stephen's, Walbrook, and a bust and inscription were to be seen there. 
Works.
He was a contributor to the Oxford volume of verse issued in 1654 to celebrate the peace with the Dutch.
In 1666, he published an attack on quacks, ‘Vindiciæ Medicinæ et Medicorum, an Apology for the Profession and Professors of Physic.’ The 1656 translation of the "Aurea Themis" of Michael Maier was by Nathaniel Hodges and Thomas Hodges (his father or his brother).
In 1671, he completed an account of the plague, which was published in 1672 as "Loimologia, sive Pestis nuperæ apud Populum Londinensem grassantis Narratio Historica". Hodges was an observer both of symptoms and the results of treatment. Bezoar, unicorn's horn, and dried toads he tried and found useless, but he recognised the merit of serpentary as a diaphoretic, and of hartshorn as a cardiac stimulant. He described pericarditis in a case of plague. A translation of "Loimologia" by Dr. John Quincy was published in 1720.

Werakata National Park

Werakata is a national park in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. The park is located to the north, east and south of the town of Cessnock (the park is separated into three distinct but closely located sections: near Abermain, near Kearsley and near Kitchener/Abernethy). The park lies within the Hunter Valley Important Bird Area.
South of the national park is the separate Werakata State Conservation Area.
History.
Originally called Lower Hunter National Park, the Werakata National Park was created on 26 February 1999 with land that had previously been part of the Cessnock State Forest (State Forest No. 874, 1130 hectares). On 1 January 2003, the park was expanded with more land from the former Cessnock State Forest (478 hectares) and also Aberdare State Forest (State Forest No. 981, 531 hectares).
The Werakata State Conservation Area was created in 2007 (with an area of 2,257 hectares).
The Hunter region was inhabited by the Awabakal, Worimi, Wonnarua, Geawegal, Birrpai and Darkinjung Aboriginal tribes, although little is known about Aboriginal use of the area in the vicinity of the park. After European settlement in the 1800s, forestry commenced and sawmills were established in and near area the area of the park (most of the timber going to local mines for pit props). The Cessnock and Aberdare State Forests were declared in 1942 and 1963 respectively and logging continued until the forests were transferred to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.
Flora and fauna.
When the park was first gazetted, the Spotted Gum-Ironbark vegetation communities found on the park were identified as being poorly represented in the regional reserve system.
The park is home to several threatened species including:

Marie Elisabeth of Hesse-Darmstadt (11 March 1656, Darmstadt – 16 August 1715, Römhild) was the only Duchess by marriage of Saxe-Römhild.
Life.
Marie Elizabeth was a daughter of Count Louis VI of Hesse-Darmstadt (1630–1678) from his marriage to Maria Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp (1634–1665), a daughter of Duke Frederick III of Holstein-Gottorp.
On 1 March 1676 in Darmstadt, she married Henry, who at the time of the marriage ruled Saxe-Gotha jointly with his six brothers.
In 1680, they divided the country and Henry became the Duke of Saxe-Römhild. He had resided there since 1676, in Glücksburg Castle in Römhild. After Henry's death, a dispute erupted among his remaining brothers over the inheritance of Saxe-Römhild. This dispute was settled definitively in 1765.
Henry loved his wife very much. He always called her "Marielies", and had several luxurious buildings built in her honor, including a cave house called "Marie Elisabeth Delight". They had no children. Henry died in 1710, leaving a massive debt. Marie Elizabeth survived her husband by five years.

St. Philippe, Illinois

St. Philippe was a village in Monroe County, Illinois, United States. Founded by Philip Francois Renault during the French colonial period in 1720, the community was located near bluffs that flank the east side of the Mississippi River along the floodplain often called the "American Bottom". The village was located three miles from Fort de Chartres.
History.
New France.
In 1719, Philip Francois Renault arrived from Picardy to the area. A friend of the French King Louis XV, Renaud was given a large tract of land for mining purposes. However, he was not as successful as anticipated. However, he founded the village of St. Philippe along the Mississippi and soon, his village was producing a surplus of crops which was sold to the towns and villages in the southern part of Franch Louisiana. The town was strategically located along fertile Mississippi River bottomland. Surpluses from the productive cultivation by "habitants" later helped supply critical wheat and corn to New Orleans and other lower Louisiana Territory communities.
D'Artaguette, an inspector in the country in the early 18th century, wrote: 
"This country is one of the most beautiful in all Louisiana. Every kind of grain and vegetables are produced here in the greatest abundance ... they have, also, large numbers of oxen, cows, sheep, etc., upon the prairies. Poultry is abundant, and fish plentiful. So that, in fact, they lack none of the necessaries or conveniences of life."
Because "habitants" did not practice fertilization, the soil became exhausted. In addition, an increase in population meant there was not sufficient land for everyone. Some villagers moved to the west side of the Mississippi and founded Ste. Genevieve about 1750, in present-day Missouri. They quickly created an agricultural community with characteristics similar to St. Philippe.
British rule.
Following their victory in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War), the British gained possession of French lands east of the Mississippi, excluding New Orleans. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763; however, the British did not arrive in force until 1765. To avoid British rule, many of the town's French residents moved across the Mississippi River to towns such as Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis in what was now, via the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau, Spanish Louisiana. Additionally, King George III's Royal Proclamation of 1763 designated all the land west of the Appalachians and east of the Mississippi an Indian Reserve. He tried to prevent settlers entering from the then-British Colonies.
American Revolution.
During the American Revolutionary War, George Rogers Clark captured Prairie du Rocher for the colonies in his campaign that resulted in the capture of Vincennes, Indiana. Reportedly, his campaign caused some of the remaining French settlers to emigrate to the Spanish-controlled territories west of the Mississippi, leaving relatively few in Prairie du Rocher. Many of the subsequent settlers of the area had been members of Clark's campaign, or were related to someone who was. They were convinced of the promise of the area by tales of the fertility of the soil in the area now called American Bottom.
Floods.
The cutting of the forest trees on each side of the Mississippi caused the river to flood many tracts of land including the village of St. Philippe.
Fort de Chartres.
Fort de Chartres is a French military fort constructed in the 18th century. It later was designated an Illinois state historic site. State budget cuts in the fall of 2008 closed the fort until the following spring. Since the fall of 2009, the fort has been open for visitors.

Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial

The Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial (, "Andartat Halalei Pe'ulot HaEiva", lit. "Monument to the Victims of Hostile Acts") is a monument to civilian victims of terrorism in modern Israel and the pre-state Land of Israel, from 1851 to the present. The memorial was established in 1998 in the National Civil Cemetery of the State of Israel on Mount Herzl, Jerusalem. At the same time, Yom Hazikaron, Israel's Remembrance Day, was officially renamed the Remembrance Day for Fallen Soldiers and Victims of Terror.
History.
The memorial was the result of a grassroots effort to get the Israeli government to recognize civilian victims of terror as it does soldiers who fall in the line of duty. Until the establishment of the memorial, bereaved families erected their own memorial plaques and markers at the places where terrorist acts had occurred. After successfully pressuring the government to pay pensions to families of terrorist victims in the 1970s, the campaign lobbied for the inclusion of a memorial ceremony for civilian victims of terror during the official state Remembrance Day ceremonies at the Mount Herzl military cemetery. This idea was strongly opposed by the families of fallen soldiers, but a compromise was reached in 2000 to hold the memorial ceremony for victims of terror two hours before the ceremony for fallen soldiers. The two ceremonies continue to be held separately.
Design.
The Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial, arranged as a series of stone walls, was designed by architects Moshe and Rita Oren. It was constructed by the National Insurance Institute and the Ministry of Defense in cooperation with the Israeli Terror Victims' Association, the legal representative of terror victims and their families. The design is intended to depict "the stand of the Jewish People against those wishing to demolish its existence". The memorial is located midway between the military graves and the grave of slain Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Rabin. 
A total of 78 black marble plaques embedded in the stone walls are engraved with the names of Jewish and non-Jewish victims of terrorist attacks in Israel. The plaques are grouped according to the following time periods: 1851–1919; 1920–1929; 1930–1939; 1940–1947; 1947–1949; 1950–1959; 1960–1969; 1970–1979; 1980–1989; 1990–1999; 2000–2009; October 2009 to the present. Plaques 1 through 60, which memorialize civilian victims of terror who died by the end of 1999, were permanently engraved on the eve of Yom Hazikaron 2006. The remainder of the plaques, memorializing civilian victims of terror who died from 2000 onwards, are temporary markers which will be permanently engraved following the approval of the victims' families.
According to Israel political scientist Meron Benvenisti, the memorial is more of an attempt to reshape collective memory than an accurate list of "victims of terror". One named victim, for example, was murdered by Arabs in 1851 after he petitioned the Ottoman rulers to remove them from their Old City home in advance of the construction of the Hurva Synagogue. Others were Jewish victims of the 1946 King David Hotel bombing perpetrated by the Irgun, a Jewish paramilitary group. The determination of inclusion as a victim of a “hostile act” is determined by the National Insurance Institute.
Stamp issue.
The memorial was depicted on a 4.70 NIS Israeli stamp issued in February 2003.
Pope Francis visit.
On May 26, 2014, in between visits to Mount Herzl and Yad Vashem during his 3-day Middle East trip, Pope Francis agreed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's suggestion to detour to the Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial, where the Pope touched the memorial wall and prayed. Netanyahu showed the Pope the memorial plaque to the 85 victims of the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, where the Pope was born.

George Seton, 6th Lord Seton

George Seton IV, 6th Lord Seton (died 1549) was a Lord of the Parliament of Scotland.
He was the son of Jean Hepburn, daughter of Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell. His father, the 5th Lord Seton was killed at the battle of Flodden and George's mother survived her husband by 45 years till 1558, managing the family's interests. When George came of age she joined the Convent of St Catherine at Sciennes in Edinburgh. After her son's death in 1549, she arranged the marriage of two of her granddaughters. 
George Seton was appointed an Extraordinary Lord of Session on 5 March 1542. Like many Scottish nobles he gave his assent to the marriage proposed between Mary, Queen of Scots and Prince Edward of England in 1543. In that year, Seton was given custody of Cardinal Beaton who opposed the English marriage, but Seton allowed the Cardinal to escape.
He died in 1549, and was first buried at Culross Abbey as Seton Collegiate Church was in the occupied zone during the war of the Rough Wooing. The English had burnt Seton Palace and the church in May 1548.
Sir Richard Maitland, who had worked for the family in their legal affairs, began his "History of the House of Seytoun" at the request of the 6th Lord Seton, the fourth George of that name, but finished the work in the lifetime of his son George Seton, 7th Lord Seton.
Elizabeth Hay.
George first married Elizabeth Hay, daughter of John Hay, 3rd Lord Hay of Yester. They had seven children;
Marie Pieris.
George married secondly Marie Pieris, a French lady-in-waiting of Mary of Guise after handfasting at Falkland Palace in February 1539. A grant from Mary, Queen of Scots to Marie in 1565 was addressed to "Dame Marie Pier, Lady Seytoun and Brieane." The couple were given a charter of the lands of Winchburgh and East Niddry on 27 June 1548. Marie's father wrote to Mary of Guise from Le Plessis Badouin in France. An undated letter survives from Marie to Mary of Guise, written from Niddry Castle, wherein she warns her that Lord Seton had heard of a plot by Regent Arran to seize the infant Queen.
George and Marie had children Robert, James and Mary Seton. On 29 August 1570, Marie and her son Robert were arrested for giving letters for Mary, Queen of Scots, to a messenger, John Moon. They were put on trial in Tolbooth at Edinburgh, on the charge that their letters denied the authority of James VI of Scotland and his representatives. They were released on their promise they would not write to Queen Mary again.

Axel Haig

Axel Herman Haig (10 November 1835 – 1921) was a Swedish-born artist and illustrator. His paintings, illustrations and etchings, undertaken for himself and on behalf of many of the foremost architects of the Victorian period made him "the Piranesi of the Gothic Revival."
Haig was born on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. His father was a landowner and timber merchant. Haig was apprenticed as a shipbuilder at the government dockyard at Karlskrona and in 1856 went to Glasgow for a further period of training at a firm of Clydeside shipbuilders. But his interests had turned to architecture and in 1859, he undertook a new apprenticeship as a draughtsman in the offices of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. After seven years there, he launched himself as an architectural artist. The middle years of the nineteenth century saw an explosion in the practice of architectural competitions. The wealth generated by the empire and The Industrial Revolution created the necessary conditions for a vast expansion in civic construction. Commissions for government offices, town halls, churches for private benefactors, railway termini were all put out to tender and competing architects required draughtsmen to illustrate their plans. In 1866 Haig met William Burges when Burges retained him to illustrate his designs for the Royal Courts of Justice in The Strand. Haig produced a series of watercolour illustrations that were "an immediate sensation." The competition's winner, George Edmund Street is said to have remarked, "I wouldn't mind being beaten by drawings like those."
Haig and Burges continued in partnership until the latter's death in 1881. In that time they jointly produced some of the most spectacular medieval visions of the Victorian Gothic Revival. Cardiff Castle, Knightshayes Court, the Church of Christ the Consoler at Skelton-on-Ure, St Mary's Church, Park House, the Speech Room, Harrow School, Castell Coch, Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut and the designs for the re-decoration of Saint Paul's Cathedral: as Burges designed his most important commissions, so Haig drew them. "In Haig, Burges, the architect of a medieval dreamland, had found an artist worthy of his dreams."
Haig developed a second career as an etcher and his drawings and lithographs of European castles, palaces, landscapes and cathedrals became hugely popular in late-Victorian England. In a review of his work published by RIBA in the year of his death, Maurice Adams wrote that "his architectural draughtsmanship ranks without a doubt amongst the foremost of his time and his graphic capability remains unique."
Haig also designed All Saints Church in Grayswood, Surrey. It was built between 1901 and 1902 in a style described variously as Surrey Vernacular or "13th-century [Gothic] with Arts and Crafts elements". It is a Grade II listed building.

<doc id="31238324" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31238324" title="Baton Rouge (band)">
Baton Rouge (band)

Baton Rouge were an American hard rock band, formed in 1986 in Pearl River, Louisiana. The band produced two albums and enjoyed limited success during the final part of the hair metal explosion in the early 1990s, before disbanding. All the band members went on to work with other hard rock recording artists and in particular vocalist and guitarist Kelly Keeling performed with Michael Schenker Group and Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
History.
The group was originally composed by Lance Bulen (vocals), Kelly Keeling (guitars and keyboards), Keith Harrison (bass) and Harold Knappenberger III(drums). The group began their career under the name Voices, later changed to Cheetah, then to Meridian and finally to Baton Rouge, because of the similar name of the band Melidian.
The band relocated to Los Angeles in 1987, experiencing changes of personnel and roles within the group. Keeling assumed the role of frontman, Bulen passed on guitar, and two new members were recruited, bassist Bryan Scott and drummer Corky McClellan. The band, still under the name Cheetah, signed to MCA Records and produced a demo and a song with Jack Ponti, before Scott departed and was replaced by Scott Bender. In 1989, after only six shows in Los Angeles clubs, Atlantic Records put the band under contract . With the collaboration of the two songwriting members of the band Surgin’, Jack Ponti and Vic Pepe (the first had worked on the first album of Bon Jovi), Baton Rouge began rehearsing material for their first album. Meanwhile in 1989, Keeling, Bulen, and Ponti, contributed some songs for the album "Point Blank" of the German hard rock band Bonfire. 
The debut album of Baton Rouge, "Shake Your Soul ", was published in 1990 with the production of Jack Ponti. The album saw the participation of several guest musicians, from drummer Frankie LaRocka of Company of Wolves and the band of John Waite, to Joey Franco, drummer of Good Rats and Twisted Sister, to Bobby Gordon and Randy Cantor on keyboards. The track "There Was a Time (The Storm)" was co-written with Jaime Kyle. Keyboard player David Cremin, is credited in the album and is pictured on the back cover but he did not participate in the recordings. "Shake Your Soul " peaked at No. 160 in the U.S. charts.
Baton Rouge underwent a change of label and another change of formation for the recording of their second album, with the addition of former Keel guitarist Tony Palmucci in place of Cremin. Their second album "Lights Out on the Playground" was released in 1991 and included the song "Desperate", written by Jack Ponti and also previously recorded by Babylon AD on their album with the same name. The album did not enter the American charts and was a commercial failure. Keeling was very unsatisfied with the music Baton Rouge had been playing and of the band itself, so when he received the offer to enter in Blue Murder, a group founded by guitarist John Sykes (Tygers of Pan Tang, Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake), he accepted the proposal. Consequently, Baton Rouge disbanded in 1991.
After the dissolution.
Kelly Keeling performed with Blue Murder until 1994 and then collaborated with former Europe guitarist John Norum (1995–1997), Michael Schenker (1999), Erik Norlander (2003), Dokken (2004) and George Lynch (2004) for both their tours and solo efforts. He also pursues a solo career as musician and vocalist. In 2006 he became the vocalist of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.
Lance Bulen collaborated with Paul Sabu and Dave Spitz, former bassist of White Lion and Black Sabbath, in a quartet called Insomnia (1993–1994) and in 1996 founded the band Puzzlegut, with former member of XYZ Patt Fontain. Bulen finally formed the band KingBaby in 2004, where he is the lead vocalist and guitarist. He has also worked as touring and session musician with many rock artists during his career after Baton Rouge dissolution.
Tony Palmucci was a session and touring player for Twisted Sister's vocalist Dee Snider solo projects.
In 1997, Jack Ponti returned to record production after a few years hiatus with a new Baton Rouge album based on some old demos and recruited Keeling as vocalist for the project. Ponti played guitars and keyboards on the album, with the help of bassist Pat Schick, keyboard player Guy Daniel and drummer Camus Celli. In September 1997, the German label MTM Music published the album under the title "Baton Rouge". Two of the tracks included on the album were written in collaboration with Stan Bush and "Love's a Loaded Gun" was a cover of the song composed by Ponti, Vic Pepe and Alice Cooper, which appeared on Cooper’s album "Hey Stoopid" of 1991. The reformed Baton Rouge lasted only for the recording the album. In fact, Keeling never considered the group as a reunion of Baton Rouge.
The original line-up of Baton Rouge reunited in 2009 to perform at the Rocklahoma rock music festival held in Pryor, Oklahoma. A permanent reunion of the band never materialized.

Yamaha XJ650 Maxim

The Yamaha XJ650 Maxim is a mid-size motorcycle by the Yamaha Motor Company introduced in 1980 as the Maxim I and produced thru 1983. Yamaha designed the high-performance XJ650 as a brand-new four-cylinder with shaft drive, and built it specifically as a special cruiser. The XJ Maxim was the successor of the XS Special introduced in 1978.
History.
Overview.
The 4 cylinder,air-cooled, twin-cam 650cc engine is housed in a cross-braced duplex steel tube frame. Yamaha made the engine narrower by locating the alternator behind the cylinder block and above the gearbox rather than on the end of the crankshaft. The Maxim had shaft drive. Contemporary reports praised the Maxim's performance and braking. Criticism was aimed at engine vibration and under-damped suspension. Succeeding Maxim models were refinements; the 1982 Maxim 650 had a more comfortable handlebar, an air-adjustable fork, and a more luxurious seat. A turbocharged variant, the XJ650 Seca Turbo, was featured in the 1983 James Bond film "Never Say Never Again". 
"Cycle" magazine said in 1982 "Three years later, after the wide proliferation of special styling, it's easy to forget what a landmark bike the Maxim was...The 650 was striking, controversial, sensational, and wildly successful in showrooms. Other companies have produced bodacious knock-offs of the 650 Maxim, imitations that suffer from excess. It's too bad the Maxim was obscured when manufacturers blanketed the market with cruisers. A decade down the road, the Maxim may well be a genuine classic of the 1980s — a bright idea that stood the test of time."
Engine/Drivetrain.
The 1980 to 1983 XJ650 Maxim combined an air-cooled, 653 cc DOHC two valves per cylinder transverse inline-four engine and shaft drive. The engine employed a one-piece crankshaft with plain bearings and placed the alternator and starter behind the engine to minimize width. A chain drives the two overhead camshafts, which used shim-and-bucket adjustment. A second chain drives the oil pump located in the crankcase, while a third (Hy-Vo) chain spins the alternator. The power unit is fed by four Hitachi constant velocity carburetors and lit by electronic ignition. Four-into-two headers extracts the waste gases, which exit through two shortened mufflers. 
Hypoid gears and a shaft turns the rear wheel, with the shaft housing forming the left side swingarm.

2011 cash for influence scandal

In 2011, the European Commission’s Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) opened a formal investigation for corruption against four Members of European Parliament (MEPs)—Romanian Adrian Severin, Austrian Ernst Strasser, Spaniard Pablo Zalba Bidegain (who was quickly cleared of wrongdoing as he had not accepted payment), and Slovenian Zoran Thaler—after an article in "The Sunday Times" claimed that they had tried to influence EU legislation in exchange for money. The "Sunday Times "journalists went undercover and approached 60 MEPs, posing as lobbyists and requesting votes to table or support certain amendments in exchange for money.
Indictments.
Strasser and Thaler resigned in March 2011; Strasser was sentenced to four years in jail on 14 January 2013. OLAF dismissed the case against Thaler, claiming that it had been unable to find "evidence to support suspicion of wrongdoing" (though it did blame the European Parliament for "refusto provide the necessary support during the investigation"). However, in January 2014 Slovenia's own judicial system found Thaler guilty and sentenced him to two and a half years in prison.
Claiming innocence, Adrian Severin has refused to step down and continues to work as an MEP, even after he was expelled by the Socialists & Democrats (S&D) group of the European Parliament. He was indicted by Romania's anti-corruption agency in September 2013 and his case is pending in court. He still has the support of the Social Democratic Party, his political party in Romania, which critics say demonstrates the "extent to which Romanian society and its political class tolerates corruption".

Jean-Louis Anselin

Jean-Louis Anselin (26 May 1754 - 15 March 1823) was a French engraver. Amongst his best work is an engraved portrait of Madame Pompadour as ""La Belle Jardinière"" (pictured).
Life and work.
Anselin was born in Paris. His name was originally ""Enslyn"", and his grandfather, who came to France after the reign of James II of England, was of Scottish origin. Jean-Louis studied engraving under Augustin de Saint-Aubin and became one of his best pupils. He started off by engraving subjects then in fashion, finding a ready market both in France and abroad at the end of the reign of Louis XV and his successor. "Le Satyre impatient" (after Jacques-Philippe Caresme) was engraved under the direction of his teacher, Saint-Aubin.
Amongst his early, independent, works were two erotic compositions after Antoine Borel - "Vous avez la clef, mais il a trouvé la serrure" and "La faute est faite, permettez quil la répare" - and "The pleasures of Anacréon", after Jean-Bernard Restout.
Not long after the death of King Louis XV's chief mistress, Madame Pompadour, he engraved a portrait of her as a shepherdess after Charles-André van Loo. He also engraved portraits of Cardinal de Bouillon; Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux; Jean-Baptiste Rousseau (the last for an edition of his works published in 1795), plus a smaller portrait of Rousseau; a small profile of Cicero after Moreau; and both drew and engraved a portrait of "Hue de Miroménil" (keeper of the seal and deputy to the Chancellor of France (Minister of Justice) from 1774 to 1787).
Amongst other large works, he engraved "The Siege of Calais", after Jean-Simon Berthélemy. He dedicated the engraving to the National Assembly, who accepted the honour officially in a session of 16 September 1789. The citizens of Calais also showed their appreciation by making him a "Burgher of Calais" on 21 January 1790. He also engraved, after Nicolas-André Monsiau, "Molière lisant son Tartuffe chez Ninon de Lenclos.
Anselin engraved the frontispiece, after Charles Monnet (1732-1808), for an edition of "The works of Bertin" (1791); a frontispiece after the sculptor Boizot, representing time surrounded by allegorical figures; four illustrations, after Monnet, for the "Works of Évariste Parny"; and the illustrations, after Monsiau, for "La Pitié", a poem by Jacques Delille (1803), which he completed with three other engravers working under his supervision (Courbe, Berthaud and Duparc).
Anselin was nominated, with Bervic, to the "education committee" for "La société populaire des arts" serving during one of the most violent times of the revolutionary era.
Jena-Louis Anselin died in Paris on 15 March 1823.

Norman Champion Toutcher (1884–1924) was a sailor, mainly known for his time as Chief Officer of the SY "Aurora" during the 1911–1914 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, under Captain John King Davis. Toutcher joined the expedition in Cardiff, and sailed to Australia, where the expedition proper started. He accompanied the "Aurora" on its first Antarctic voyage—south from Hobart to Macquarie Island, on to the Antarctic mainland to drop off the land parties, and back to Australia. However, Davis thought Toutcher a "hopeless fool", and he was replaced by Frank D. Fletcher on 12 March 1912, when the "Aurora" arrived back in Hobart.
Cape Toutcher, on the west coast of Macquarie Island, is named after him.

Tatoeba

Tatoeba.org is a free collaborative online database of example sentences geared towards foreign language learners. Its name comes from the Japanese term "tatoeba" (例えば　"tatoeba"), meaning "for example". Unlike other online dictionaries, which focus on words, Tatoeba focuses on translation of complete sentences. In addition, the structure of the database and interface emphasize one-to-many relationships. Not only can a sentence have multiple translations within a single language, but its translations into all languages are readily visible, as are indirect translations that involve a chain of stepwise links from one language to another.
The site is open to the public. Registration is mandatory in order for a user to contribute sentences, translations, or comments, but no requirements regarding linguistic background are imposed on those who wish to register.
Tatoeba was founded by Trang Ho in 2006. She originally hosted the project on Sourceforge under the project name "multilangdict". She now administers the project with Allan Simon, who joined in 2009. Tatoeba is hosted and supported by the Free Software Foundation France. The data collected by the project are freely available under a Creative Commons Attribution license.
Content.
As of January 2014, Tatoeba's corpus has over 2,800,000 sentences in 132 languages. The number of sentences in each language can be found on Tatoeba's language statistics page. The interface is available in 17 different languages. There are procedures by which one can help to add new interface and content languages.
Tatoeba is also the current home of the Tanaka Corpus, a public-domain series of about 150,000 English-Japanese sentence pairs compiled by Hyogo University professor Yasuhito Tanaka first released in 2001, and where it is undergoing its latest revisions.
Interface.
Users, even non-registered ones, can search for a word in any language to retrieve a list of sentences using that word. Each sentence in the Tatoeba database is displayed next to its translations in other languages; direct and indirect translations are differentiated. Sentences are tagged for content such as subject matter, dialect, or vulgarity; they also each have individual comment threads to facilitate feedback and corrections from other users and cultural notes. As of the beginning of 2012, almost 26,000 sentences in 9 languages had audio readings. Sentences can also be browsed by language, tag, or audio.
Registered users can add new sentences or translate or proofread existing ones, even if their target language is not their native tongue. Translations are linked to the original sentence automatically. Users can freely edit their own sentences, "adopt" and correct sentences without an owner, and comment on others' sentences. Advanced contributors, a rank above ordinary contributors, can tag, link, and unlink sentences. Corpus maintainers, a rank above advanced contributors, can untag and delete sentences. They can also modify owned sentences, though they typically do so only if the owner fails to respond to a request to make the change.
Database structure.
Tatoeba's basic data structure is a series of nodes and links. Each sentence is a node; each link bridges two sentences with the same meaning.

Alan Whitehead (footballer born 1956)

Alan Whitehead (born 20 November 1956) is an English former professional footballer who made more than 350 appearances in the Football League playing as a central defender for Bury, Brentford, Scunthorpe United, York City, Wigan Athletic, and Halifax Town.
Career.
Whitehead was born in Bury. He began his football career with non-League club Darwen before being given his Football League debut for his hometown club Bury F.C. by Bob Stokoe while still an amateur, playing at centre forward against Preston on Boxing day 1977 in front of 26,000. He played five games altogether whilst still at college including a League Cup tie against Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. He went on to play more than 100 times for the club in all competitions including scoring the winning goal in the fourth round of the F.A.Cup against Burnley. This goal gave the Shakers a plum 5th round tie at Anfield. In 1981 he moved on to Brentford for a club record fee of £78,000 and was their Player of the Season in 1982. In early 1984 he joined Scunthorpe United again for a club record fee of £27,000. Scunthorpe became the third consecutive club for which he made more than 100 appearances, and he was chosen as their Player of the Season for 1985–86. He left them for York City in late 1986, spending 18 months with the club, including a spell on loan at Wigan Athletic, where he played in a Division 3 first leg play-off at Ayresome Park. He then joined Halifax Town, but his career with that club was disrupted by injury, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent, and he returned to York City as a member of the coaching staff.

Robertson ministry (1875–1877)

The Robertson ministry (1875–1877) or Third Robertson ministry was the fifteenth ministry of the Colony of New South Wales, and was led by the Honourable John Robertson. It was the third of five occasions that Robertson was Premier. Robertson was elected in the first free elections for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly held in March 1856. 
The title of Premier was widely used to refer to the Leader of Government, but not enshrined in formal use until 1920.
There was no party system in New South Wales politics until 1887. Under the constitution, ministers were required to resign to recontest their seats in a by-election when appointed. These by-elections are only noted when the minister was defeated; in general, he was elected unopposed.
This ministry covers the period from 9 February 1875 until 21 March 1877, when Robertson was defeated by Henry Parkes at the 1877 election.

Chris Petersen (actor)

Chris Petersen (born August 18, 1963) is an American actor. Beginning his career as a child actor at the age of 12, he is best known for his roles in the feature films "When Every Day Was the Fourth of July", "The Swarm" and "The Little Dragons". Rising to prominence among teen audiences during the late 1970s and 1980s, he is also remembered for starring in various teen anthology series of the time including "ABC Afterschool Specials", "CBS Afternoon Playhouse" and "NBC Special Treat", as well as for his co-starring role on Norman Lear's "interactive" situation comedy, "The Baxters".
Early life.
Chris Petersen was born Christopher P. Petersen on August 18, 1963 in Los Angeles, California, sometimes mistakenly credited professionally as "Chris Peterson". His younger brother is former child actor Pat Petersen (born August 9, 1966), who also appeared in a number of films and television series of the time, including co-starring alongside Chris in the 1980 feature film "The Little Dragons" (also known as "Karate Kids, U.S.A.").
Career.
Early career.
Petersen began his television career in 1977 with a small featured role on the ABC action-crime series "Starsky & Hutch". In the episode titled "The Psychic", Petersen made his television debut with a small role as "Ringo", one of two boys who are caught stealing tires from Starsky's Ford Gran Torino. In January 1978, Petersen had a guest-starring role on the NBC period drama "Little House on the Prairie". In the episode titled "The Rivals", Petersen played Jimmy Hill, a boy in Walnut Grove, who Laura (Melissa Gilbert) falls in love with and whose affections she feels she must compete for; ultimately resulting in what would be Laura's first kiss on the series.
Teen career.
In March 1978, Petersen landed his first film role in the NBC television movie, "When Every Day Was the Fourth of July". In the film, Petersen starred as Danny Cooper (later portrayed by fellow child star Ronnie Scribner in the sequel), a boy growing up in a small New England town in 1937 who, along with his sister (Katy Kurtzman), must find a way to exonerate the town's gentle misfit after he is accused of a murder. Later that same month, Petersen co-starred on the popular children's anthology series "The ABC Afterschool Special". In the episode titled "The Rag Tag Champs", Petersen played Pat McCleod, one of the players on a troubled baseball team in need of a qualified coach. In July of that year, Petersen appeared in his first feature film role in Irwin Allen's camp disaster-thriller, "The Swarm". In the film, Petersen had a featured role as "Hal", one of the boys who fire-bomb a hive of killer bees that are attacking the residents in their small Texas town.
In December 1978, Petersen followed up with the lead role in a 5-part mini-series presentation of "CBS Afternoon Playhouse". The series, an anthology showcase primarily aimed at adolescents, was CBS's answer to the "ABC Afterschool Special". In the special presentation titled "Joey and Redhawk", Petersen played the titular role of Joey, a 14-year-old from Ohio who learns to survive in the Colorado Rocky Mountains with the help of an apache he meets named Redhawk (Guillermo San Juan). Advertised as an "afternoon mini-series for young people", the feature film length story debuted on Monday December 4, 1978, with a 30-minute installment airing each day through Friday December 8, 1978, and also featured an early co-starring appearance by Eric Stoltz as well as a teenage Danny Bonaduce. In March 1979, Petersen appeared on the CBS action-adventure series "The Incredible Hulk". In the episode titled "No Escape", Petersen guest-starred as Steve, a young teen who encounters "The Hulk" (Lou Ferrigno) in an all-night laundromat and runs out frightened without his clothes.
In September 1979, Petersen landed one of the lead roles on the Norman Lear situation comedy "The Baxters". On the series, Petersen co-starred as Jonah Baxter, the teenage son of a middle-class suburban family living in St. Louis. The series was the first "interactive sitcom" of its kind, wherein the first half of each 30-minute episode presented a vignette dramatizing the events in the lives of the Baxter family, and the second half was an "instant analysis" talk show segment, giving a live studio audience and guests an opportunity to express their opinions about the topic being presented that week. Although credited by several online sources as "Chris Peterson", this is simply a misspelling and he was credited properly on the show. The series was produced in Hollywood for the 1979–1980 season before production was moved to Ontario, Canada and an entirely new Baxter family was introduced, played by an all new cast.
In March 1980, Petersen appeared in a co-starring role on an episode of "The NBC Special Treat", yet another anthology series showcasing adolescent teleplays akin to the "ABC Afterschool Specials". In the episode titled "The House at 12 Rose Street", Chris starred alongside fellow child actor Moosie Drier, as one of the boys in an all-white suburban neighborhood when the first African-American family moves in. In July 1980, Petersen appeared in what would be his first and only starring feature film role in the action-comedy, "The Little Dragons" (also known as "Karate Kids U.S.A."). The film co-starred both Chris and his younger brother Pat as brothers Zack and Woody, two young karate students who set out to rescue a new friend after she is kidnapped and held for ransom by a woman (Ann Sothern) and her two bumbling sons. Although most online sources list the film as being released in 1980, the Petersen brothers appear to be notably younger than in their various other roles during that same year. Indicated by their youthful appearance and hairstyles, the film appears to have been filmed sometime between 1977 and 1978.
Later career.
After finishing his year on "The Baxters", just as his brother Pat was rising to prominence as Michael Fairgate on the CBS primetime drama "Knot's Landing", Chris Petersen's acting career was coming to its end. In October 1981, he had a small role on the NBC mystery-crime drama "Quincy, M.E.". In the episode titled ', Petersen appeared as one of the students attending a high school "career day"; his character simply credited as "Boy". In November of that same year, Petersen made what would be his final on-screen appearance on the CBS comedy-drama "M*A*S*H". In the episode titled ', Petersen appeared in a small role as one of three young recruits whom B. J. Hunnicutt challenges to a game of pinball; this time simply credited as "Second Recruit".

John Quincy (medical writer)

John Quincy (died 1722) was an English apothecary known as a medical writer.
Life.
He was apprenticed to an apothecary, and afterwards practised medicine as an apothecary in London. He was a Dissenter and a Whig, a friend of Dr. Richard Mead, and an enemy of Dr. John Woodward. He studied mathematics and the philosophy of Isaac Newton. He died in 1722.
Works.
He knew little of clinical medicine, and was only skilful in the arrangement of drugs in prescriptions. He considered dried millipedes good for tuberculous lymphatic glands, but thought the royal touch for scrofula superstitious. He received the degree of M.D. from the University of Edinburgh for his ‘Medicina Statica Britannica’ (1712), a translation of the ‘Aphorisms’ of Sanctorius, of which a second edition appeared in 1720. Joseph Collet, governor of Fort St. George, was one of his patrons, and Quincy printed in 1713 a laudatory poem on their common friend, the Rev. Joseph Stennett. 
He published in 1717 a ‘Lexicon Physico-medicum,’ dedicated to John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, who had just been admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London. It is based on the medical lexicon of Bartolomeo Castelli of Messina (died 1607), published at Basle in 1628, and went through eleven editions, of which the last two appeared respectively in 1794 and 1811 (greatly revised). His ‘English Dispensatory’ (1721), of which a fourth edition appeared in 1722 and a twelfth in 1749, contains a complete account of the materia medica and of therapeutics, and many of the prescriptions contained in it were popular.
In 1719 he published a scurrilous ‘Examination’ of John Woodward's ‘State of Physick and Diseases.’ A reply, entitled ‘An Account of Dr. Quincy's Examination, by N. N. of the Middle Temple,’ speaks of him as a bankrupt apothecary, a charge to which he made no reply in the second edition of his ‘Examination’ published, with a further ‘letter to Dr. Woodward,’ in 1720. In the same year he published an edition of the "Loimologia" of Nathaniel Hodges, and a collection of ‘Medico-physical Essays’ on ague, fevers, gout, leprosy, king's evil, and other diseases. In 1723 his ‘Prælectiones Pharmaceuticæ,’ lectures which had been delivered at his own house, were published with a preface by Dr. Peter Shaw.

Biography.
Stevens was born on August 31, 1918 in Hawi, North Kohala, Hawaii. She was a descendant of Charles Stevens, an American whaler who arrived in Hawaii in the 1840s. She was born one of six children of Robert Naea Stevens and Julia Kaaoaolahilahiokeohokalole Bell. Her name Napua was a shortened version of her name Kawaiala Kao'ionapuapi'ilani which means "the perfumed water" and "the finest flower in the bouquet of Pi'ilani. She was of Scots and native Hawai'ian ancestry. Her great-great-grand-grandmother was a descendant of ancient native Hawai'ian kings.
In 1949 she recorded "Beyond The Reef" on the Bell Records label (like her other hits), written by Canadian Jack Pitman. It was later recorded by Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley and The Ventures. Other notable hits include "Hawaiian Hospitality", "I Want to Learn to Speak Hawaiian", "Pretty Red Hibiscus", "May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii" and "What Aloha Means". In the hit "Hawaiian Hospitality" she sings of meeting a handsome dark-eyed local on Waikiki beach and his Hawaiian hospitality. In "I Want to Learn to Speak Hawaiian" she sings of her desire to learn the Hawaiian language so "she can say the sweetest things and do the hula too."
In 1948 she joined the "Aloha Week" organization and was responsible for producing and narrating hundreds of hula shows, with performers such as Daddy Bray, Bill Ali'iloa Lincoln, Vickie I'i Rodrigues (her cousin) and others. In the 1950s she hosted her own radio show KTRG and presented her own TV cooking show "Napua's Kitchen" in the 1960s for eight years. Stevens later made some appearances as an actress, including two episodes of "Hawaii Five-O" (1969–1973).
She also narrated television coverage of the annual Kamehameha Day parade for years into the 1970s for KITV. 
Stevens was also talented at the crafts and in 1971 authored a book "The Hawaiian Quilt" which was an instruction/guide manual to the Hawaiian quilt.
Personal life.
In her prime she was described as being particularly physically attractive with one person commenting that "Napua was the loveliness of all Island girls in one, a ripe-mango beauty with raven hair and ivory skin". She was a cousin to Bill Ali'iloa Lincoln, another noted hula musician. Several people related to Napua Stevens are also successful musicians or entertainers in Hawaii.
She died on January 7, 1990 at the age of 71.

Devendra Bishoo

Devendra Bishoo (born 6 November 1985, New Amsterdam, Berbice, Guyana) is a Guyanese and West Indian cricketer of East Indian origin. He is a leg-spinner who made his international debut playing for the West Indies cricket team in the Cricket World Cup 2011.
Bishoo was named as ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2011, but has since lost his place in the team through a combination of loss of form and competition brought on by Sunil Narine and Shane Shillingford.
Domestic Career.
Bishoo is a leg spinner who has risen through the ranks since his debut in the 2008 season. He cut his teeth at the first-class level and courted immediate success, snaring four five-wicket hauls, and ten in one match, in his first couple of seasons. 
His attacking style of bowling had a major impact in the 2010 Caribbean T20 where he finished with ten wickets in four games at the mean average of 8.20, conceding just 5.12 runs an over. 
His Man-of-the-Series award in that tournament tipped him as one of the players to watch out for in the Champions League Twenty20.
He was named in West Indies A team for unofficial test tour to India in September 2013.
International.
Bishoo was a replacement for the injured Dwayne Bravo at the World Cup in Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka from 19 February to 2 April 2011. He made his international debut against England at Chennai on 17 March, taking 3/34 in his 10 overs. Bishoo adapted his bowling to the slow pitches of the Indian subcontinent, reducing the pace of his stock delivery and introducing variations of speed.
Bishoo played his first Twenty20 International match against Pakistan at St.Lucia. He put in a match-winning performance of 4/17 in 4 overs taking the Man of the Match award as West Indies won by 7 runs.
When Australia visited in March 2012, the selectors rested Bishoo for the ODI series. It was hoped that he would be more effective in the Tests if the Australian batsmen were not allowed to get used to his bowling. In the event he played just one Test, conceding 169 runs for a solitary wicket, and was replaced by off-spinner Shane Shillingford. Rather than accompanying the West Indies on their tour of England in May 2012, it was felt that Bishoo would be better off accompanying West Indies A in India to regain confidence.

Aussiedraco

Aussiedraco is a genus of basal ornithocheiroid pterodactyloid pterosaur from the early Cretaceous of Australia. 
"Aussiedraco" is known from holotype QM F10613, a partial mandibular symphysis housed at the Queensland Museum, recovered from rocks of the Toolebuc Formation, about 70 km east of Boulia, western Queensland, dating to Albian stage. It was named by Alexander W.A. Kellner, Taissa Rodrigues and Fabiana R. Costa in 2011 and the type species is "Aussiedraco molnari". The generic name is derived from "Aussie", a shortened form of Australian, and "draco", from Latin meaning dragon. The specific epithet honours Ralph E. Molnar, who first described the specimen in 1980.
The symphysis fragment is 88 milimetres long and very straight and narrow, with a lanceolate not-expanded tip and triangular cross-section. It lacks a keel or crest and is convex on top, with a median narrow deep groove not reaching the tip, but flat at the bottom. As far as can be judged from the empty elliptical tooth-sockets, the lower jaws carry at least five pairs of teeth, which are rather large and become more outwards inclining and procumbent towards the front. "Ausiedraco" is estimated to have been smaller in size than "Mythunga", a pterosaur from the same formation.
Kellner e.a. assigned "Aussiedraco" to the Pteranodontoidea, a clade roughly containing the same species as the Ornithocheiroidea "sensu" Unwin. "Aussiedraco" would be closely related to the Anhangueridae.

Salzburg bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics

Salzburg 2014 was an unsuccessful bid by the Austrian Olympic Committee to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2014 Winter Paralympics in Salzburg, Austria. Salzburg was one of seven applicants for the games, and one of three to be short-listed, along with Sochi, Russia, and Pyongchang, South Korea. It was the second consecutive time Salzburg bid for the Winter Olympics, after the close call with the 2010 bid, and the four consecutive time Austria bid, having bid with Graz in 2002 and Klagenfurt in 2006. The 2014 bid is more compact than the 2010 project due to the elimination of the Kitzbühel, St. Johann and Ramsau venues. One venue (Schönau am Königssee for bobsled, skeleton and luge) is located in Germany.

Robert McIntosh (cricketer)

Robert Ian Fanshawe McIntosh (19 August 1907 – 21 March 1988) was an English cricketer born in Darjeeling, India. He was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium-fast.
McIntosh was educated at Uppingham School in Rutland, where he played for the school cricket team and for three years he was the mainstay of their bowling attack, captaining the side in 1926, a season in which he took 45 wickets at a bowling average of 11.45. He later went to Oxford University, where he played for the University Cricket Club, making his first-class debut in 1927 against the Harlequins. 1927 was also the year that McIntosh played his only first-class match for the West of England when they played the touring New Zealanders at the County Ground, Exeter; additionally in 1927 he also made three appearances for Devon in the Minor Counties Championship. From 1927 to 1929, McIntosh made 21 first-class appearances for Oxford University, playing his final match for them against Surrey.
McIntosh received his Oxford Blue in his first year of 1927, thanks largely to an injury to Walter McBride, and in 1928. Poor health and having to bowl on over-prepared wickets which led to a poor bowling season for him in 1929 ruled him out of contention for a Blue in that year. A bowler, he took 62 wickets in total for the University. These came at an average of 34.33 and included two five wicket hauls, with best figures of 5/52.
McIntosh later returned to the British Raj, where he played a single first-class match each for the Europeans (India) against the Indians and for Madras against the Marylebone Cricket Club, both in 1934. He died in Budleigh Salterton, Devon on 21 March 1988.

Switzerland at the Paralympics

Switzerland made its Paralympic Games début at the inaugural Paralympic Games in Rome in 1960 (sending just two athletes, who nonetheless won four medals), and has participated in every edition of the Summer Paralympics. It also took part in the inaugural Winter Paralympics in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik, and has competed in every edition of the Winter Games.
Swiss athletes have won a total of 380 Paralympic medals, of which 117 gold, 133 silver and 130 bronze, placing the country 17th on the all-time Paralympic Games medal table. The country has won 228 medals at the Summer Games, and 152 at the Winter Games.
Switzerland's best result at the Summer Games came in 1984, when its athletes won 43 medals, of which 18 gold. Its worst result in terms of medal haul came in 1964, with just one silver medal, but it had sent a delegation of just one athlete (archer Caroline Troxler-Kung). Its highest ranking was 13th, in 1960; its lowest was 40th, in 2004. The country placed 2nd on the medal chart at the inaugural Winter Games in 1976, its best result, winning 10 gold medals. Swiss athletes also won 10 gold medals in 1998, but their highest medal haul over all came in 1988, when they took 37 medals (of which 5 gold). The country's poorest result was in 2006, when for the first time the Swiss failed to win a gold medal, and finished 13th on the medal chart, with one silver and a bronze.
Switzerland's most successful athlete, and one of the most successful Paralympians of all times, is wheelchair athlete Heinz Frei, who since his début in 1984 has won fourteen gold medals, seven silver and eleven bronze, in track events, road cycling and cross-country skiing. He has, in particular, won the Paralympic marathon for his disability category on two occasions, in 1984 and in 1992. In addition, wheelchair athlete Franz Nietlispach, over the course of his career from 1976 to 2004, won fourteen gold medals, six silver and one bronze in track events, from sprinting to long distance running, as well as a bronze medal in road cycling. At the 1984 Games, he managed a virtually clean sweep of the six individual racing events he entered, winning gold in five, but taking "only" silver in the 100 metres, where he was beaten by D. Barret (full name not recorded) of the United States. At the 1988 Games, Nietlispach won six gold medals in individual races, including the 5,000 metres (though he was again beaten in the 100 metres). Rolf Heinzmann, for his part, won twelve gold medals and two silver in alpine skiing between 1980 and 2002, including a clean sweep of the downhill, slalom, giant slalom and Super-G in 1998.

Glattpark

Glattpark is a large construction project in Switzerland that is taking shape in Opfikon, close to the border to Zurich. As part of the construction project a new neighbourhood will be built by 2020; it is designed to provide room for 7,000 residents and about the same number of jobs.
Some of the favourable locational factors used to market the area are the direct proximity to the city of Zurich, where similar construction projects are being realized in Oerlikon and Seebach. The large service companies based in the north of the city and other companies in Glattbrugg, Rümlang and at the airport promise a large number of potential jobs. One of the negative points is that the area is about two miles from the threshold of runway 34/16 of Zurich Airport and thus practically in the axis line of the runway. However, construction in the area is placing a strong emphasis on noise isolation of the buildings, with inhabitants reporting that the noise levels are not significant.
Headquarters.
The headquarters of Kraft Foods Europe GmbH are located in Glattpark.
Park.
On the eastern side of the area an artificial lake has been created as well as a park area, called Opfikerpark. The artificial lake is 41 metres wide and 550 metres long and is safe to swim in, with sandy beaches having been included in the design. Bridges cross the lake at regular intervals to link the inhabited zone with the park.
Transport.
The neighbourhood is intended to have as little traffic as possible, most of the roads are therefore planned as a pedestrian zones.
In addition to the Glattalbahn, which runs the length and breadth of the southern and western side of the neighbourhood, several bus lines linking it to public transport are under discussion. It is planned to have bus line 781 run through the neighbourhood on Boulevard Lilienthal as soon as this road has been completed. The nearby railway station Opfikon provides access to the Zurich S-Bahn network, the Glattalbahn forms a direct link to the train stations of Zurich Oerlikon, Glattbrugg and Stettbach.
On the western side, the four-lane Thurgauerstrasse leads to the intersection of Opfikon with the Highway A51 (airport motorway).

List of South Africa women cricket series

Since playing their first international cricket match in December 1960, the South Africa national women's cricket team have contested a number of cricket series against other nations, in all three forms of the game: Test, One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket. A cricket series can consist of any number of individual matches, but typically includes between one and five matches.
The first international cricket match involving South Africa women was a Test match held at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, the same venue as the one for first men's Test match in the country in 1889, and ended in a draw. South Africa then played a subsequent series against New Zealand in 1971–72. As part of the international campaign against apartheid, the Commonwealth of Nations signed the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, excluding South Africa from competing in international sporting events. Because of this exclusion, they did not play another Test until hosting India in 2001–02, before facing England again in 2003 and most recently the Netherlands in 2007.

Fuerdai () is a Chinese term that means "the second generation of the rich". This term is currently often expressed in the Chinese media and everyday discussions in mainland China, as it incorporates some of the social and moral problems that are associated with modern Chinese society.
Fuerdai are sons and daughters of the Chinese "nouveau riche" of the early years of China's reform era (from the late 1970s onward). During the new era, in which private initiative could be rewarded by wealth, many new rich Chinese emerged in the former-socialist Chinese society. While such wealthy individuals reached their new socioeconomic position through their own initiative and efforts, their children often enjoy a comfortable lifestyle and have a much easier and obstacle-free life path.

<doc id="31238865" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31238865" title="Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș">
Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș

Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș (; also known as Al. Tzigara, Tzigara-Sumurcaș, Tzigara-Samurcash, Tzigara-Samurkasch or Țigara-Samurcaș; April 4, 1872 – April 1, 1952) was a Romanian art historian, ethnographer, museologist and cultural journalist, also known as local champion of art conservation, Romanian Police leader and pioneer radio broadcaster. Tzigara was a member of the "Junimea" literary society, holding positions at the National School of Fine Arts, the University of Bucharest and lastly the University of Cernăuți. During his youth, he was secretary to Carol I, the King of Romania. Close to the royal family, he also served as head of the Carol I Academic Foundation, where he set up a large collection of photographic plates. Tzigara achieved fame in 1906 as founder of the "National Museum", nucleus of the present-day Museum of the Romanian Peasant, but was also involved in arranging and preserving the Theodor Aman art fund.
During World War I, Tzigara-Samurcaș irritated Romanian public opinion by accepting to serve in a puppet administration set up by the Central Powers. Although his conduct was considered benign by the legitimate government, it drew him accusations of collaborationism from within academia, and aggravated his long-standing conflict with historian Nicolae Iorga. Tzigara was prevented from advancing in his university career over the interwar period, but compensated for this mishap with other achievements: he was a delegate to several world fairs, the first-ever lecturer on Radio Romania's staff, the editor in chief of "Convorbiri Literare" magazine, and, shortly before retirement, a corresponding member of the Academy. His post-World War II years were spent in obscurity, owing to his ideological incompatibility with the Romanian communist regime.
Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș was alleged to be Carol I's illegitimate son, a rumor fueled by his closeness to court. He was himself the father of artist Ana Tzigara Berza, and father in law of folklorist Marcu Berza.
Biography.
Origins and early life.
A native of Bucharest, Tzigara-Samurcaș was born on , and baptized into the Romanian Orthodox Church. A popular rumor has him as the illegitimate son of "Domnitor" Carol I, the future King of Romania, to whom Tzigara was especially close in later years. Historian Lucian Boia gives some credit to this piece of oral history, and notes that Tzigara, like Wilhelm and Mite Kremnitz, had "an unusually tight relationship" with the royal family. Researcher Zigu Ornea, who notes that Tzigara may have been spreading the story around, argues: "This legend is naturally hard to verify but, in any case, it is a possible one, since Tzigara-Samurcaș was born in 1872 and Carol I was present on our throne, as "Domnitor", from 1866." Like Boia, Ornea notes that Tzigara's close relationship with the king, the king's repeated interventions on his behalf "every time career got stuck", and his contacts with the Kremnitzes (including Mite, Carol's alleged mistress) were some additional clues to a royal bloodline. Historian Vasile Docea criticizes Ornea's verdict, noting that it relies on questionable sources, and argues that, far from taking pride in this legend, Tzigara spoke "with evident pride" about his Tzigara roots. According to historian Lucian Nastasă, Docea effectively "disproved" the rumor of Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcașs royal descent.
Alexandru's mother and Carol's alleged mistress was Elena Samurcaș, married to Toma Tzigara. Research into his maternal genealogy led the art historian to conclude that he was of noble Greek and Italo-Greek descent: his supposed ancestor was "Spatharios" Zotos Tzigaras, buried in Venice at San Giorgio dei Greci (1599). The Samurcaș family had aristocratic blood, being related to the boyar nobility of Wallachia: the art historian's paternal line made him a relative of the Kretzulescu, Rallet, Bengescu and Crețeanu boyar families. Also of boyar rank, Alexandru's Samurcaș ancestors had a history on both sides of the Southern Carpathians, in Wallachia and in then-Austrian-ruled Transylvania. Active during the Age of Revolution, Wallachian "Vornic" Constantin Samurcaș took part in Eterist agitation, but later, fleeing the 1821 rural uprising, settled in Kronstadt (Brașov) to spy for the Austrians. Another ancestor, "Postelnic" Alecu Samurcaș, was a linguist, known for his work in the Greek language. The meeting of two branches was recorded in the coat of arms that Tzigara-Samurcaș fashioned for himself, showing the "spatha" of Zotu Tzigara, alongside a sable (Romanian: "samur") and a stylized eyebrow.
A while after Toma Tzigara's death, Alexandru was adopted by his childless uncle Ioan Alecu Samurcaș (he officially took the name "Tzigara-Samurcaș" years later, in 1899); he was also helped with his education by the Kremnitzes, who taught him German, introduced him to high society circles, and regarded him as a son. His first contacts with history and folk art came by means of his extended family, which collected and preserved documents and art objects.
After graduating from the Matei Basarab High School and taking his Baccalaureate, he enlisted at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters, Historical Section. It was here that the young man was acquainted with his first mentors: writer-collector Alexandru Odobescu and archeologist Grigore Tocilescu, the latter of whom ensured Tzigara's employment as custodian for the National Museum of Antiquities. He was a critic of the museum's underdevelopment under Tocilescu's management, and wrote that the disorganized collection comprised an Egyptian mummy, copies of frescoes from the Cathedral Church in Curtea de Argeș, items from the Pietroasele Treasure, and works of Precolumbian art, alongside a scale model of the Eiffel Tower.
From 1893, the young graduate was in the German Empire, where he studied at the University of Berlin and the Ludwig Maximilian University, taking his Ph.D. in Munich with a dissertation on the Baroque painter Simon Vouet. He received his diploma, "magna cum laude". Tzigara-Samurcaș returned to his home country and, following a dispute with Tocilescu, gave up his position at the Antiquities Museum. He later specialized in museology in Paris, hearing lectures at the "École des Beaux-Arts" and working for city museums, before returning to Germany, where he studied with the preeminent Brunswickian curator Wilhelm von Bode.
Early academic career.
Back in Romania, Tzigara unsuccessfully applied for the Archeology Chair created at the University of Iași, but lost; according to scholar and diarist Teohari Antonescu, who emerged as the victor, the competition was rigged in his own favor, even though Tzigara "had the good sense to come prepared." From 1899, he was librarian of the Carol I Academic Foundation and Professor of Aesthetics and Art History at the National School of Fine Arts. As Tzigara later acknowledged, his introduction to royalty came through a relationship with the Kremnitzes, his neighbors on Polonă Street, Dorobanți. This period saw the start of Tzigara's close relationship with Carol, whom the art historian later called "my most generous protector" and "the sovereign """. Received into royal circles, he was a confidant of the Queen Consort and cultural patron, Elisabeth of Wied, whom he called "the animator of Romanian art". For a while, he was her private secretary, helping her fulfill her literary ambitions under the "Carmen Sylva" signature. Tzigara's recollections speak with enthusiasm about Elisabeth's works, as well as about the king's dislike for her interests in spiritism or philosophy, and discuss Carol's enduring affection for Mite Kremnitz.
In order to support his lectures at the Fine Arts School, Tzigara began gathering photographic plates, a collection which grew in size over the following decades. It includes images of European monuments and works of art, as well as samples of Romanian architecture (in some cases, the only surviving images of since-demolished buildings) and copies of maps. The images of local life are considered of particular importance, since they document the Westernization and modernization of Romania's landscape. Mostly anonymous works, they most likely include some of Tzigara's own photographs. A few of them were inventoried by Editura Casa Școalelor, and some were published, in Tzigara's lifetime, by "Buletinul Comisiunii Monumentelor Istorice" or other Romanian scientific magazines. His image projections at the Carol I Foundation, supporting a students' elective course on sculpture and painting, became one of the better-known student summer activities.
The young scholar was at the time also interested in the development of decorative arts, which he wanted to reflect the local tradition of handicrafts and notions of national specificity. According to art historian Ioana Vlasiu, Tzigara and painter-researcher Abgar Baltazar were in part responsible for fusing local folk art and international primitivism with Art Nouveau, thus paving the way for the "Neo-Brâncovenesc" school of decorators and architects. The interest in decorative works was a special focus of his visits to England and France—the South Kensington Museum impressed him greatly, as did the workshops of Eugène Grasset and Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran.
"Junimea" debut.
Described by Lucian Nastasă as a case of social climbing, Tzigara's marriage to Maria (1900) brought him into the high circles of aristocracy: Maria, born into the Cantacuzino family (daughter of Alexandru Cantacuzino, former Foreign Affairs Minister), was also the widow of Grigore Sturdza, and as such inherited part of the Sturdza family fortune. Through her mother Coralia, Maria Tzigara-Cantacuzino was additionally related to boyar lines of Moldavia, the Boldurs and the Costakis, as well as to Zulnia, mother of historian Nicolae Iorga. This marriage was reportedly arranged by the Kremnitzes, the couple having as their best men-godfathers two influential political figures: Lupu Kostaki, Constantin C. Arion.
During the "fin de siècle" period, Tzigara-Samurcașș also began a cooperation with "Junimea", the literary society representing Romanian traditional conservatism, and sympathized with the "Junimist" nucleus of the Conservative Party. The art historian was one of the young scholars fascinated with the personality of Titu Maiorescu, the cultural critic and main "Junimea" leader, and joined a new "Junimist" critical elite which also comprised Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Pompiliu Eliade, Mihail Dragomirescu, P. P. Negulescu etc. His work was featured, along with texts by other 50 "Junimists", in the Editura Socec volume "Lui Titu Maiorescu omagiu, XV februarie MCM" ("To Titu Maiorescu as Homage, February 15, 1900"). Maiorescu's diaries display his interest in Tzigara's private life, and claim that the scholar was by then lover of the widowed and much older Mite Kremnitz, with whom Maiorescu himself had had an affair.
Tzigara attended, in 1901, a major event in "Junimist" society: the wedding between Nicolae Iorga and Ecaterina, daughter of scholar Ioan Bogdan, where Tzigara unofficially represented the royal court. Tzigara was the couple's godfather at an Orthodox marriage service held outside the Kingdom of Romania, in Belgerei (Șcheii Brașovului), Transylvania. For a while, Iorga and Bogdan were both interested in obtaining Tzigara a better employment at the University of Bucharest, but their efforts were made useless by the "Junimea" adversary in government, the National Liberal Party.
Before 1903, Tzigara became a literary and art columnist at "Epoca" newspaper, headed at the time by Maiorescu. During the period, "Junimea" popularized its causes through "Epoca", rather than through their main venue "Convorbiri Literare", and, according to Maiorescu's own pronouncement, Tzigara's work was a main asset. Around 1907, Tzigara's work was also regularly featured in "Convorbiri Literare", edited by Maiorescu's pupil Simion Mehedinți. At the time, Transylvania's "Răvașul" journal commented that Tzigara's art chronicle and Aurel Popovici's political column were especially "rich" in information, and mentioned that Tzigara and Teohari Antonescu were debating, through the journal, about the characteristics of fortified houses ("cule") from Oltenia region. As literary historian Tudor Vianu notes, Tzigara-Samurcaș and architect Aurel Zagoritz centered their contributions here on the scientific study of Romanian folk art, but their presence nevertheless coincided with "Convorbiri Literare"s decline in readership. Tzigara also published his articles in Iorga's traditionalist magazine "Sămănătorul", where he discussed the art exhibits of the "Tinerimea Artistică" society.
National Museum creation.
Around 1901, inspired by the Paris World Fair, Tzigara and other Romanian ethnographers first took into consideration the establishment of a permanent ethnographic collection. Like other Romanian intellectuals, Tzigara preserved his special interest in handicrafts, which, art conservator Isabelle Longuet argues, were "elevated to the status of 'national art' " in the belief that the peasantry represented "an authentic 'Romanianness' ". In similar terms, ethologist Ioana Popescu notes: "collections were to become the argument and the source of inspiration for the national ideology and creation." His project came after a similar attempt on the part of art collector Nicolae Minovici, founder of the private folk art museum "Casa Minovici", and an even earlier textile art archive, endorsed by Maiorescu (1875).
1906 marked the start of Tzigara's chief work as an ethnographer. That year, he founded the "Museum of Ethnography and National Art", now Museum of the Romanian Peasant (and which he intended to name "Museum of the Romanian People"), serving as its Director for the next forty years. This project received support from Education Minister Haret and, on the other side of politics, from Haret's predecessor Maiorescu. The institution was later known as "Museum of Ethnography and National Art" or "Carol I Museum of Ethnography and National Art". Its original quarters were the abandoned National Mint building on Kiseleff Road, but plans were being made for a new, more adequate museum palace.
As manager, Tzigara-Samurcaș ordered the collection into two distinct sections, dedicated respectively to ethnography-proper and sacred art (the latter chapter also took over the religious objects kept at the National Museum of Antiquities). An additional exhibit was to include the "Tropaeum Traiani" metopes, attesting the Roman Empire's rule over Dobruja. Tzigara's subsequent work as a collector and folk art historian received much appreciation. A 1914 article in "Luceafărul" journal stated: "reorganized [the museum and turned into a true national institution. The Museum's rich collections are owed to Mr. Tzigara-Samurcaș's industriousness." In 2010, folk art reviewer Mihai Plămădeală wrote that Tzigara's activity "impacted on everything that this Museum ever meant in the history of Romanian culture."
Tzigara's fieldwork also focused specifically on increasing the museum's ethnographic collection. Particularly active in Oltenia, he was, as Ioana Popescu notes, "more attracted by decorated, colorful objects, used at celebration time." During one such trip to Gorj County, he bought, disassembled and transported back to Bucharest the "Antonie Mogoș House", considered a masterpiece of Romanian woodcarving and the museum's centerpiece. It is the first-ever such relocation in the history of Romanian museums. His photographic collection was expanded by an entire series on Oltenian carpets, which helps in their specific taxonomy.
The developments raised interest among the ethnic Romanian community of Transylvania, whose cultural body, the ASTRA Society, was in the process of creating its own permanent exhibit of folk architecture, later ASTRA National Museum Complex. ASTRA activist Octavian Tăslăuanu reported in 1909: "national art museum, although [... important sums were spent on it, is at the early stage of its beginnings. Only two years ago did more systematic work begin for its endowment and presently, its national significance recognized, the state granted it a yearly sum of 14,000 lei [...]. And maybe in a few years those who are running it, so diligently, will manage to turn it into an institution of great importance for our national art." The next year, Tzigara himself wrote, in "Convorbiri Literare", that Tăslăuanu's work with ASTRA permanent exhibits was far more advanced than his when it came to storage and display, but noted that the ASTRA collections were not yet rich enough to validate the "museum" name.
Aman Museum and Bucharest University.
During those years, Tzigara was also an inspector and evaluator of works collected from Secu Monastery and the Diocese of Buzău, becoming both a Fellow of the Romanian Royal Society of Geography and the Architects' Society. Tzigara also served as representative of the Romanian curators in European colloquiums: the Public Art Congress of Liège, Belgium (1905) and the Braunschweig Congress on Art Conservation (1906), where he presented a report on the efforts to preserve Romanian monuments. Also in 1906, Tzigara-Samurcaș attended the 8th International Congress of Art History. Once familiarized with the artistic fashions of the day, Tzigara reported to the National Liberal Education Minister Spiru Haret about the need to reform the educational system in such manner as to provide peasant children with an artistic education, citing reasons moral and economical.
Around 1908, Tzigara was also involved in the process of cataloging and preserving the body of works left by Romanian painter Theodor Aman. The Aman Museum appointed him director, and, under his leadership, opened its doors to the public for the very first time. Tzigara was also involved in controversies marking the celebration of Carol I's 40th year on the throne, when he spoke out against politician Ioan Lahovary, accused of mismanaging the Carol Park festivities.
The creation of a separate University of Bucharest Art History Department for Tzigara was a project which split the academic and political world. At the core of such disputes was Nicolae Iorga, from the History Department, who argued that his own courses also covered art, and who consequently became Tzigara's main adversary. The proposal of expanding University was also defeated in Parliament by Lahovary, the Senate president, who probably still resented for his 1906 comments. The debates prolonged themselves over the following years. In 1909, Tzigara-Samurcaș, Grigore Tocilescu and George Murnu competed with each other for the Archeology Chair, and this created a dispute over whether art historians could not lecture in archeology (Murnu eventually won the contest, despite being exposed for plagiarism by Tzigara, in articles for the magazine "Noua Revistă Română"). The same year, he was in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, where he visited the Skansen, Bygdøy and Lyngby open-air museums, but suggested that a similar project would be redundant at home, arguing that peasant society in Romania was only too visible around Bucharest. He was much more impressed with the Nordic Museum, which reportedly became the template for his Bucharest museum.
In 1911 (or 1912), Tzigara eventually became a Substitute Professor of Art History at the University of Bucharest, attending the Great Art Exhibit of Berlin and, in Italy, the "Esposizione internazionale d'arte". He lectured on folk art at the "Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin" and in Austria-Hungary, at the Vienna "Museum für angewandte Kunst". Overall, his mission was to introduce Romanian art to an international audience, as noted by "Luceafărul": "he arranged the Romanian pavilions, making known for the first time in history the artistic creations of our people. In all exhibits he registered successes". A prestigious visitor of the National Museum was Raymund Netzhammer, the Catholic Archbishop of Bucharest, who was introduced there by Tzigara, with whom he remained good friends. Netzhammer was impressed with its ethnographic collection: "Nowhere can one acquire a better eye for Romanian folk art than in this establishment."
In support of his activities, Tzigara published a succession of art books. In 1906, "Arta publică" ("Public Art") appeared in Bucharest, while the German-language study "Denkmalpflege in Rumänien" ("Historical Preservation in Romania") saw print in Karlsruhe. Later, Tzigara contributed biographical and critical entries in the 1907 edition of "Allgemeines Lexicon der bildenden Künstler". "Catalogul Muzeului Aman" ("The Aman Museum Catalog") of 1908 was followed the same year by the essay "Ce se înțelege prin arheologia de azi" ("The Present-day Meaning of Archeology") and the monograph "Biserica din Filipeștii de Pădure" ("The Church of Filipeștii de Pădure", co-authored with Nicolae Ghica-Budești and Gheorghe Balș). In 1909, he authored the album-study "Arta în România" ("Art in Romania"), comprising his collected "Convorbiri" essays and edited by Minerva, together with another monograph, "Muzeul neamului românesc" ("The Museum of the Romanian People").
The next year, he followed up with "Discuțiuni în jurul arheologiei" ("Debates on Archeology") and "Rumänische Volkskunst" ("Romanian Folk Art"); in 1911, with "Casa românească de la Roma" ("The Romanian House of Rome"); in 1912, with "Sonderaustellung Rumäniens" ("Romania's Special Exhibit"), "Istoria artei și însemnătatea ei" (Art History and Its Significance"), "Muzeul național din București" ("The National Museum Bucharest"). Between 1909 and 1912, he also redacted Carol I's 17 volumes of memoirs, working from scattered notebooks. As an art critic for "Epoca" and "Convorbiri", Tzigara became one of those who opposed the new primitivist tendencies of the "Tinerimea Artistică" group: in 1910, he chided the modern sculptor Constantin Brâncuși for his break with tradition, and even suggested that Brâncuși's works be hidden away from the public eye. Such reactions made Brâncuși decide to leave Romania and begin his international career.
While in Rome, Tzigara was reputedly offered membership in the Freemasonry's Grand Orient de France, to whom many of Romanian colleagues belonged ("see Freemasonry in Romania"). The offer, Tzigara later claimed, was made by sculptor Ettore Ferrari, and included various perks and a promise that he would soon become a Masonic Grand Master. Although widely rumored to have taken up the offer, Nastasă writes, Tzigara was probably never a Freemason. Also in 1911, he was briefly President of a newly created professional association, the Romanian Writers' Society.
1910s projects and ASTRA conferencing.
Tzigara's honors for 1912 included the Romanian Kingdom's "Bene Merenti" medal for services to culture. During much of that year, after some campaigning to obtain state funds, the art historian considered proposals for the Ethnography Museum's headquarters, also housed on Kiseleff. He and his colleagues looked into international proposals, from Heino Schmieden, Louis Blanc and others, but eventually settled for a design proposed to them by the Romanian native Ghica-Budești. The Neo-Brâncovenesc features of the building, researchers note, where themselves an attempt to highlight the return to a peasant model. This formed part of a greater urban planning effort undertaken, with Carol I's approval and the involvement of Neo-Brâncovenesc architects, throughout northern and central Bucharest, with the erecting of many new public buildings: the Palace of Justice, the CEC Palace, the Geology Museum etc. ("see History of Bucharest"). Despite the approval, and the ceremonial placement of a foundation stone, construction was remarkably slow or under-financed, and Tzigara, who came to resent Ghica-Budești, did not live to see its completion.
Tzigara's scientific work for 1913, when he also attended the "Tentoonstelling De Vrouw" event in Amsterdam, includes a monograph on the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral Church. That year, as Romania joined the Second Balkan War coalition against the Kingdom of Bulgaria, and although spared from conscription, Tzigara volunteered for service in the Romanian Land Forces. He motivated this initiative by stating that his skill was needed for documenting the war and creating its archive. Tzigara served in the 4th Army Corps, under Crown Prince Ferdinand (Carol I's designated successor).
In 1914, Tzigara was appointed Director of the Carol I Foundation. At around the same time, he began a new series of conferences in Austria-Hungary, lecturing on art for the benefit of Romanians in Transylvania and Banat regions. He was also interested in the collection of Transylvanian Romanian artifacts, added to the Bucharest Museum collection. Initially, he was in Lugosch (Lugoj), informing locals about Romanian folk art. One other such event took place in Hermannstadt (Sibiu), where he was invited by ASTRA to speak about the 50 years of development in Romanian art.
This conference contained Tzigara' artistic credo: he believed that art was an objective reflection of social and cultural development, identifying the Westernization process, the proclamation of the 1881 Kingdom and later events with a profound transformation of Romania. However, Tzigara suggested, these efforts did not yet find a suitable answer in the artistic field, that is the birth of a specifically Romanian art phenomenon and the proper conservation of artistic legacies: he deplored the destruction of old Bucharest townhouses and their replacement with Westernized villas; he commended the restoration of Horezu Monastery in its original "Brâncovenesc" style, but criticized those who introduced Gothic revival elements at Tismana, Bistrița or Arnota; lastly, he expressed support for the "healthy" Neo-Brâncovenesc style of Ion Mincu and criticized muralist Octavian Smigelschi for his work on the Sibiu Cathedral. The conference included ample praise of Carol I as a patron of conservation, and nods in the direction of Carol's French architect, André Lecomte du Nouÿ.
The second part of Tzigara's Hermannstadt conference focused on the Romanian school of oil painting. He paid homage to its traditionalist founder, Nicolae Grigorescu, and to Aman, before summarizing the later contributions of Ștefan Luchian, Arthur Verona and Jean Alexandru Steriadi. The third part highlighted his own research of Transylvanian folk art, and spoke about Romania's Queen Elisabeth as a collector of folk art from Sibiu area.
Tzigara preserved these principles during the rest of his professional life, and the themes of his conferencing resurface in his old age memoirs. These too shed light on Carol I's architectural role, and express approval for Lecomte de Nouÿ's since-criticized methods of conservation (including the decision to the tear down and rebuild Curtea de Argeș Cathedral). They also return to Smigelschi's murals, criticizing his depiction of saints in national Romanian dress as highly inappropriate.
World War I and Germanophilia.
Tzigara's international and scholarly activities suffered from the outbreak of World War I in summer 1914, even though Romania remained neutral until mid-1916. His purported father, Carol I, died in September 1914. According to his Archbishop Netzhammer, Tzigara was deeply affected by the event: "Like a child, he loosened his suffering, deploring in front of me this terrible and unexpected loss". By then, however, Tzigara had befriended Ferdinand I, the new king, and was an admirer of Ferdinand's wife, Marie of Edinburgh. He found that Ferdinand was "gentle", "jocular" and usually self-effacing, "in all things the opposite of his uncle" Carol I. In Queen Marie, the art historian recognized a political woman, more active in public affairs than Carol's Elisabeth. Tzigara also shared Marie's artistic taste, including her passion for the work of Romanian Symbolist sculptors Oscar Späthe and Friedrich Storck (whom, in 1903, he had called them "innovators of Romanian sculpture").
Unlike Ferdinand and his Francophile circle, who desired a Romanian alliance with the Entente for the sake of union with Transylvania, Tzigara was opposed to any move against Germany. He represented the Germanophile lobby within the University of Bucharest, at the same junior level as another substitute professor, Constantin Litzica. For a while, he was also co-opted on the leadership committee of the Romanian Writers' Society, but lost his seat there in 1915 (probably owing to his presence among the minority of Germanophile writers).
The subsequent campaign ended abruptly in southern Romania's invasion by the Central Powers (Germans and their allies). In November 1916, shortly before King Ferdinand and the pro-Entente government retreated to Iași, they appointed Tzigara-Samurcaș a custodian of the Crown and Royal Domains, tasked with preventing acts of vandalism on the occupiers' part. He stayed behind in Bucharest and met with August von Mackensen, head of the occupation forces. As a result of this encounter, the Germans asked Tzigara to discuss an offer of collaboration with the senior Conservative Party Germanophiles: Maiorescu, Alexandru Marghiloman, Petre P. Carp. All three refused to openly associate with Mackensen's military rule, but a puppet civilian administration was set up under Carp's disciple Lupu Kostaki. Carp's reply to Tzigara's proposition is recorded as: "Such a thing is of no interest to me; it is nonsense, and at this moment counts as weakness." Maiorescu's deteriorating relationship with Carp was also a factor: Carp flatly refused to attend any meeting where Maiorescu was present, and alienated the other two by stating that King Ferdinand should be deposed. Maiorescu himself explained that it was a question of principle: "Tzigara has been proposing this to me, but I did not wish to. If orders me to go, let him send in armed soldiers to take me."
On , the art historian took over as Police chief in occupied Bucharest. This proved to be a highly controversial decision, the consequences of which would harm Tzigara's interwar career. While his political adversaries later alleged that Tzigara had been granted the appointment through German pressures, he himself claimed that Carp and Kostaki had asked him to become involved. Also according to Tzigara, his appointment resolved a practical issue, since his legitimate predecessor, General Alexandru Mustață, could not speak any German. Kostaki's administration also included Litzica, who was puppet Minister of Education in spring 1917. Tzigara personally intervened in the selection of other bureaucrats. In February 1917, he brought writer I. A. Bassarabescu into his Police apparatus, obtaining his release from German internment and appointing him head of division. Reportedly, he did the same for philosopher Mircea Florian, who became his Carol I Foundation subordinate.
As recorded by Archbishop Netzhammer, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș was open and cooperative in his relationship with the new authorities and the German community. In September 1917, the Romanian scholar greeted Wilhelm II, German Emperor, who was visiting the occupied half of Romania. Reportedly the only Romanian in attendance, he followed Wilhelm to the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral, where they both paid their respects to Carol I's tomb. Tzigara was also a personal guest at the imperial table, and Wilhelm had several long conversations with him in private. At the end of their encounter, Tzigara received from the emperor's hand a diamond-and-ruby tie pin.
Tzigara-Samurcaș nonetheless had a complex relationship with his German supervisors. He refused to cooperate with them on several occasions, objecting to the creation of a German Institute within the University, and being strongly opposed to the Central Powers' interventions on Bucharest Royal Palace grounds. In late 1916 and early 1917, he was in intense correspondence with Ion Bianu, a fellow scholar and disillusioned Germanophile, who complained about the "Deutsches Heer" pressures on the Romanian Academy and asked Tzigara to intervene on his colleagues' behalf. On one occasion, as a result of Bianu's plea, Tzigara sent in his policemen to prevent German soldiers from stealing the Academy's firewood reserves. Boia argues that the main objective of Tzigara's term, "the security of people and property", was competently met. The same is noted by Ornea, who cautions: "the nude fact of his, all things considered, willing collaboration with the German occupier, is still a litigious issue". The Police chief was also critical of his more docile colleagues: as recorded in Marghiloman's diary, Tzigara was present at the October 1917 Athénée Palace gala organized by Mackensen (October 1917), but was irritated to find himself in the company of junior bureaucrats who were well liked by the Germans. He referred to this category, which included poet Luca Caragiale, as the "nippers". In December of the same year, Caragiale enraged Tzigara by going over his head: the poet used German connections to obtain Police guards at an official function, after Tzigara had refused to grant his request.
Collaborationism scandal and late 1920s.
In January 1918, while the Iași authorities were considering a way out of the war, Tzigara-Samurcaș handed in his resignation to the Germans. A separate peace with the Central Powers followed: in March–April, the new national unity government of Marghiloman reassigned him to the position of Police chief. This posting, made legitimate by King Ferdinand's royal decree, Tzigara kept until November 14, 1918—that is, three days after the Armistice with Germany reshuffled Romania's commitments. During the interval, with only 220 forces under his command, he was powerless to deal with the growing protest movement of Romanian Railways workers.
Romania's sudden return to Francophilia had also brought Marghiloman's downfall, described by Tzigara as an anti-Conservative ""coup d'état"". Zigu Ornea finds this expression of resentment especially problematic, since, he argued, it meant that Tzigara placed Germanopilia above the establishment of Greater Romania: " understood next to nothing from the reality of the wartime political phenomenon."
The end of the war signified a slump in Tzigara's career. His imperial tie pin, Boia notes, became a ""corpus delicti"" for those accusing Tzigara of treason. Such accusations were given ample exposure in Rector Ion Atanasiu's essay "Rătăciri naționale" ("National Ravings", 1919), answered to in detail by Tzigara's own "", "Mărturisiri silite" ("Forced Confessions", 1920), and later by his posthumously published "Memorii" ("Memoirs"). Athanasiu was the first who suggested holding Tzigara accountable for his wartime behavior, and, in his University report, alluded to the possibility of sacking both him and the Germanophile biologist Victor Babeș. Ornea finds that, in those years, Athanasiu and Tzigara's traditional foe Nicolae Iorga were waging "a veritable war against Tzigara-Samurcaș".
Tzigara was omitted from an early purge of University Germanophiles, but, on November 29, 1919, was subjected to questioning by Rector Atanasiu, Iorga and the Board of Professors. As he later recalled, his defense tactic was to recall that, back in 1906, Iorga himself was seen as a radical Francophobe ("see Sămănătorul"). On Iorga and Atanasiu's proposal, but against the advice of Ion Cantacuzino and Dimitrie Onciul, the Board took a vote to ban Tzigara-Samurcaș; the result was indecisive, and Tzigara preserved his chair. Atanasiu however took the vote as evidence that Tzigara had lost his support, and requested a decision from higher authorities. As Boia notes, this was a political miscalculation: the anti-Germanophile lobby had been defeated in Parliament by Prime Minister Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, who could not be expected to grant Atanasiu a victory. In the end, Education Minister and zoologist Ioan Borcea sent a letter to Atanasiu, asking him to desist frustrating Tzigara "in his attributions without legal decision", adding: "Especially at this moment in time, we find it necessary that peace and harmony be restored for University to function properly." These and other moral defeats prompted Atanasiu to present his resignation, which came with his final protest that Minister Borcea had snubbed University during the "Tzigara-Samurcaș affair". In later years, Tzigara took his main accusers, Iorga and journalist Stelian Popescu, to court, in what became two celebrity trials.
As noted by literary critic Dumitru Hîncu, the art historian's wartime conduct was never censured by the interwar governments. He was again received into Queen Marie's circle, who allegedly told him: "Iorga is jealous that he sees you coming over to visit with us." Tzigara was still an art columnist for "Convorbiri Literare", and, in 1921, became its new editor in chief. According to ASTRA's newspaper, "Transilvania", Tzigara rescued "Convorbiri" from bankruptcy, but only catered to a niche audience. He was thus unable to steer the magazine back into the cultural mainstream, its previous dominance replicated by the left-wing "Viața Românească".
In 1923, he was the Inspector General of Museums, under the National Liberals' Ion I. C. Brătianu cabinet, in which capacity he revisited the ASTRA Museum and awarded it a 50,000 lei grant from the state. The period also witnessed his first private visits to the Transylvanian spa town, Sovata. His main home in Bucharest was a large villa on Kogălniceanu Street, where he was living with his family.
Despite his confirmation at the university, Tzigara-Samurcaș found it impossible to achieve tenure, and was also ousted from the Fine Arts School over his Germanophilia. With the diplomatic recognition of Greater Romania came new opportunity, and, in 1926, Tzigara left for Bukovina, taking over the art history department at Cernăuți University. Also that year, a mortally ill King Ferdinand made him a Grand Officer of the Order of the Star of Romania. Again touring Germany with a series of conferences (1926), Tzigara also spoke at Radio Berlin, making his debut in radio programming. Reportedly, his request of creating a special Romanian section on Berlin's Museum Island was granted by the Weimar Republic in early 1927.
On November 1, 1928, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș provided the first-ever Radio Romania broadcast in history, with an art lecture specifically written for this purpose. This, Tzigara recalled, was a "pro bono" activity to please Radio Romania's president Constantin Angelescu, but made the speaker himself very nervous: Tzigara thought his own text bland and his voice ill-adapted for the medium, but took pains to improve them in later broadcasts. In 1929, Tzigara was a first judge at the original Miss Romania beauty contest, in a panel which also included Vaida-Voevod, writers Liviu Rebreanu and Nicolae Constantin Batzaria, woman activist Alexandrina Cantacuzino and other public figures.
Romanian cabinets appointed him a national representative at the Universal Exposition in Barcelona, Spain, and organizer of the folk art exhibit at the International Peace Bureau's Balkan Conference in Athens, Greece. He also attended the 13th International Congress of Art History in Stockholm, Sweden, and organized the Romanian pavilion at an Art Conference in Helsinki, Finland. His efforts won international recognition, and the French state, through Bucharest Ambassador Gabiel Puaux, presented Tzigara with a gift of Sèvres porcelain. He was also awarded the Order of St. Sava by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
1930s.
Tzigara's position was threatened in 1930, when Ferdinand's deposed son Carol II retook his throne. It was alleged that Iorga, a supporter of the new king, asked for Tzigara to be removed from the royal Foundation, but that Carol had stated not being willing to sack "my own uncle." Iorga was however in a position to limit his rival's access to academia when, in 1931, he became Carol II's Prime Minister. His legislative proposal, limiting the number of academic positions an individual could hold, was probably aimed specifically at Tzigara and other personal enemies (as Lucian Nastasă writes, Iorga was himself collecting some five monthly salaries from his work with the state).
At around the same time, Tzigara became a contributor to the official literary and scientific magazine, "Revista Fundațiilor Regale", and again toured the country with lectures on folk art. With Simion Mehedinți and the ASTRA Society, he returned to the field of public activism with controversial lectures on the biology of the Romanian nation, which sometimes included overt advocacy of eugenics. His racialist theory had it that the geometric abstraction of peasant art, purported to have been strongly resistant to foreign influence, placed Romanians in the "Alpine race" cluster—an idea rejected in its day by anthropologist Henric Sanielevici, who contrarily believed that Romanians were "Mediterranean".
Moving away from Germanophilia, Tzigara saluted the Brussels World Fair of 1935 by highlighting the special connection between Romania, on one hand, and, on the other France, Belgium and the Francophone countries. He spoke on Radio France and the INR (he found the Francophone services to be more relaxing, but less organized, than their German counterpart). In the 1920s and '30s, Tzigara was host to several foreign researchers. Columbia University professor Charles Upson Clark called his institution "splendid", finding it partly responsible for a "distinct revival" in peasant crafts. He described the museum as "a revelation of the artistic endowment of the Roumanian peasant." French archivist François de Vaux de Foletier visited his museum in 1934, later writing, in "Monde et Voyages" magazine, that it featured "very interesting galleries of Romanian ethnography".
Beginning 1933, Tzigara was several times interviewed by Eugen Wolbe, the German biographer of Romanian kings, who had been sent to him by Carol II. Tzigara also reviewed Wolbe's texts, including his work on Queen Elisabeth (a "weak" study, in Tzigara's opinion), and described the visiting writer as an unreliable amateur: "that pensioned ex-"Gymnasiallehrer" still had the audacity to select himself such august subjects, with the pretext of 'gaining many new friends for the beautiful country' of Romania, of which yet he himself knew so little!" Tzigara was upset to receive a copy of Wolbe's 1937 work on Ferdinand, which, he claimed, entirely ignored specific criticism; he also approved of Prime Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu's decision to ban the volume in its Romanian edition (the censoring left Wolbe indifferent, a fact noted in one of his letters to Tzigara). Tzigara's rival Iorga, probably incited by this controversy and by his own work with Wolbe, gave the book a positive review in his journal "Neamul Românesc", calling the government measure "regrettable", and receiving further criticism from Tzigara, through "Convorbiri".
The Carol I Museum increased in size throughout the interwar, organized several exhibits, and, in 1931, inaugurated its Ethnographic Section at the new Kiseleff location. In parallel, Tzigara popularized Romanian handicrafts abroad with his new French-language tract, "Tapis Roumains" ("Romanian Carpets"). Other contributions, published by "Convorbiri Literare" in 1934, include an introduction to Alexandru Odobescu's posthumous texts, "Ineditele lui Odobescu" ("Odobescu's Unpublished Texts") and an edition of Odobescu' 1895 suicide note. Another work, grouping his articles in defense of the Museum's construction, was published in 1936 as "Muzeografie românească" ("Romanian Museography"). Tzigara and cultural historian Nicolae N. Condeescu also left a monograph on the Peleș Castle, Carol I's residence in Sinaia.
As editor of "Convorbiri Literare", Tzigara also entered a polemic with a younger Maiorescu disciple, the critic and novelist Eugen Lovinescu. At the root of this debate stood Lovinescu's book on Mite Kremnitz and her affair with national poet (and "Junimist" herald) Mihai Eminescu. Joining in with other conservatives who accused Lovinescu of being a "pornographer", Tzigara claimed to defend Eminescu's image from the book's impiety. Lovinescu offered his replies in the daily "Adevărul", accusing Tzigara of "literary incompetence", and deploring the decline of "Convorbiri" beyond the threshold of professionalism: "if, under previous directions, the magazine steered away from its stated mission [...], the deviance was at least made in an honorable direction, that is to say in the direction of history writing; the scientific seriousness of its two former directors had made it possible for "Convorbiri" to have valid contributions in areas other than literature." In reaction to claims of irreverence, he derided his adversary's artistic expertise as being about "Easter eggs", and defended his narrative as a sample of respect for Eminescu's life and legacy.
Tzigara met significant opposition in his bid for Romanian Academy membership, primarily from Academy member Iorga. He was eventually elected a corresponding member in 1938, when Iorga's influence was being challenged by his younger peers. The same year, he was pensioned from his positions at Cernăuți University and the Foundation. In 1939, he dedicated himself to completing his homage to the memory of Carol I, on his 100th birthday: "Din viața regelui Carol I. Mărturii contemporane și documente inedite" ("From the Life of King Carol I. Contemporary Testimonials and Never-before Published Documents"), called "splendid" by Lucian Nastasă. He resigned from his editorial office at "Convorbiri", which was taken over by writer and linguist I. E. Torouțiu. Tzigara announced this change with a final editorial piece, which read: "Satisfied to have insured the magazine's future, we announce at this moment that we are placing our directorial office in the hands of a new generation, which is led by Professor I. E. Torouțiu, [...] who with his valuable and sizable published works, appreciating "Junimea"s role in the movement to renew the Romanian literary language, will know how to carry on the ever-lasting flame of "Junimist" ideas".
At that point in life, Tzigara was also pleased with the state and popularity of museology in Greater Romania; in 1937, he had claimed: "all the country is presently a museum". His hostility to open-air museums was by then a thing of the past, since, it was argued, Greater Romania's peasant society seemed threatened by modern urbanization. In the late 1930s, this judgment prompted sociologist Dimitrie Gusti to create the National Village Museum, located a short distance away from Tzigara's own building site.
World War II and final years.
A final moment of preeminence in Tzigara's career occurred during World War II. Initially, with war looming, Chief of the Romanian General Staff Florea Țenescu tasked Tzigara with drafting an "Ex-ante International Convention Project for the Protection of Monuments and Works of Art", which was never put into motion. In summer 1940, during a period when Carol II was trying to calm tensions between Romania and Nazi Germany, Tzigara, Ion Nistor, Grigore Antipa, Ion Sân-Giorgiu and other academics greeted a Nazi visitor, scholar Herbert Cysarz.
After 1940, Romania ousted Carol II's National Renaissance Front government, replacing it with an openly fascist, pro-Axis regime, the National Legionary State. In parallel, Tzigara managed to gather political support for terminating Nicolae Ghica-Budești's contract and, in 1941, hired architect Gheorghe Ionescu to finalize the Museum's construction. Late in the same year, he was one of the Romanian scholars who welcomed German Romance studies expert Ernst Gamillscheg on his visit to Bucharest. In 1942, he was tasked by Romania's military dictator Ion Antonescu with creating a monumental National Heroes' Cemetery in Carol Park, but the building works were cut short by the reversal of fortunes on the Eastern Front. Also then, he returned to research with a book about the carpets and rugs of Oltenia, which notably stated his ethnic nationalist credo in art: "By using the everlasting heritage of our beautiful folk art in different fields, we will be easily able to get rid of the foreign influences that pervaded Romanian households."
Shortly after the August 1944 Coup deposed Antonescu, the daily "România Liberă", which was at the time a Romanian Communist Party tribune, featured Tzigara's name on a list of "national betrayal", which also included Germanophile or fascist intellectuals. Two years later, the pro-communist cabinet of Petru Groza sidelined Tzigara-Samurcaș, appointing him honorary director of the museum, but effectively stripping him of his responsibilities. At that stage, plans were being examined for the disestablishment of the Peasant Art Section at the Museum, but Tzigara obtained support from Communist Party man Emil Bodnăraș and from Presidium Chief Constantin Ion Parhon. Tzigara attended the clandestine meetings of the Mihai Eminescu Association, an anti-communist group formed through the efforts of critic Pavel Chihaia, and which disappeared in 1948. His chief activity, from 1948 to 1952, was the writing of his memoirs.
The official establishment of Romania's communist regime was the start of several new problems for the aging scholar: many of his belongings were taken away during nationalization, others were sold in public auction, while he himself was taken to court by some of his former employees. In 1948, he was also stripped of his Academy membership. The following year, his pension was suspended, although, in 1950, he was elected to the International Committee of the History of Art. The National Museum was reopened in 1951 as a "National Museum of Folk Art", under new management.
Marginalization aggravated Tzigara's illnesses, and he died on April 1, 1952. He was buried at Bellu Cemetery, with a small ceremony attended by family and a few of his intellectual friends: "Convorbiri" colleague Mehedinți, "Junimist" philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, physician Daniel Danielopolu and writer Gala Galaction. He had lost his public profile, and the international community was left uninformed of his death: in 1955, an invitation to the 18th Art History Congress was mistakenly addressed to him.
Legacy.
Tzigara's contribution as an art historian has received mixed evaluations. According to Lucian Nastasă, his 1911 course at the Bucharest University was the first professional approach to the subject, after the "somewhat organized" attempts on Odobescu's part. Writing in 1920, art historian Gheorghe Oprescu also suggested that, with Nicolae Iorga's reviews, Tzigara's "intelligent articles" were the only ones in the Romanian press to properly educate the public taste. Charles Upson Clark also rated "Tzigara-Samurcash" as one of Romania's "best-known modern writers" in the field of archeology or ancient art, with Alexandru Lapedatu, George Murnu and Abgar Baltazar. Contrarily, a later assessment made by ethnologist Romulus Vulcănescu rated both Tzigara, Iorga and Oprescu as authors of "ethnological essayistics and cultural microhistory", who lacked a global approach to folk art research. Dumitru Hîncu, writing in 2007, noted that, once "a first-rate cultural figure", Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș "no longer says a great deal for your average present-day reader".
The art historian's figure inspired literary critic George Călinescu in writing his novel "Scrinul negru", about the decline of Romanian aristocracy. A more unusual trace of his activity is preserved in "Tzigara-Samurkasch", the name of a fictional place in the writings of Bukovina native Gregor von Rezzori. A comment left by Tzigara in his Peleș Castle book has fueled cyberculture speculation and an urban legend about the existence of 20 lei coins from the 1860s, which are supposedly extremely valuable items.
Tzigara-Samurcaș's Museum building was only finished after his death, later in the 1950s. By the time of its completion, however, the building's purpose had changed, and, historian Andrei Pippidi writes, it "passed through the most humiliating of its stages". Its collections were moved to a new location, and, in 1978, merged into the Village Museum. The Kiseleff building was assigned to the "Lenin-Stalin Museum", which later became the Communist Party Museum. Shortly after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 toppled communism, the Salvation Front Minister of Culture Andrei Pleșu created, on National Museum grounds, a Museum of the Romanian Peasant, which he placed under the direction of painter Horia Bernea. It was officially inaugurated in 1993. Although sometimes described as Tzigara's successor, Bernea, helped by ethnologist Irina Nicolau, merged the scientific function into a conceptual art project, which is described by various commentators as a radical break with the interwar National Museum.
According to Lucian Boia, Tzigara's work with the Germans in World War I continues to be perceived as a stain on his career, and was as such omitted from official histories which deal with the period. This, Boia notes, happened especially during the latter, nationalist, stage of Romanian communism, when World War I was presented as a moment of anti-German "unanimity". However, the period also brought the publication of Tzigara's collected "Scrieri despre arta românească" ("Writings on Romanian Art", 1987). The first installment of Tzigara-Samurcaș's memoirs was first published in 1999, ten years after the Revolution, by Grai și Suflet imprint. Later volumes saw print with Editura Meridiane. These works have raised interest for their historical and biographical content, but, Zigu Ornea contends, are largely without literary value. Ornea also criticized the two editors, Ioan and Florica Șerb, for only including some citations from Tzigara's contemporaries as notes, instead of a more complete critical apparatus. Editura Vitruviu also published another volume of Tzigara's memoirs, as "Lupta vieții unui octogenar" ("An Octogenarian's Lifelong Combat", 2007).
A large part of his photographic plates ended up as a special fund of the Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism. In May 2010, they were inventoried and published, in print and DVD format, as "Arhiva Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș". A selection of these works was displayed in 2011, during a special Museum of the Romanian Peasant exhibit, sponsored by the Romanian Cultural Institute. The rest, preserved by the Fine Arts School, were donated to the Museum of the Romanian Peasant in 2000. A Tzigara-Samurcaș Foundation was created with the goal of preserving folklore and handicrafts. Its projects include the revival of Ocna Șugatag "hore" and the "Ethnophone" folk music events, sponsored by the European Union's "Culture 2000".
Tzigara's son, Sandu Tzigara-Samurcaș, was a poet, known for his 1943 volume "Culesul de apoi" ("The Latter-day Reaping"); his wife was poetess Adrienne Prunkul. His Bucharest salon braved communist censorship and, in the 1950s, hosted poets such as Ion Barbu and Nichita Stănescu. Sandu had two sisters, of whom Ana Tzigara became, in 1935, the wife of folklorist Marcu Berza. Settled with her husband in Italy until her death in 1967, she established her reputation as a post-Impressionist painter and, after the 1989 Revolution, had her retrospective exhibition at the Museum of the Romanian Peasant. Maria, Tzigara's other daughter, was a violinist for the Romanian Film Orchestra, married into the Berindei family (and thus became related to historians Dan and Mihnea Berindei).

Crewe type (locomotive)

The Crewe type locomotive was a design of steam locomotive designed by Alexander Allan (locomotive engineer) and William Buddicom during the 1840s. It was widely copied elsewhere, particularly in France.
History.
During the early 1840s Alexander Allan and William Buddicom of the Grand Junction Railway created the design incorporating inclined outside cylinders and a double frame. It was built due to combat the frequent failure of crank axles on contemporary inside cylinder locomotive designs. The earliest examples were built by Buddicom at Chartreux for the Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest in 1844 where the type became know known as 'Le Buddicom'.
The first British examples were built by the newly created London and North Western Railway (LNWR) at Crewe Works in 1845, with a 2-2-2 wheel arrangement for passenger classes and 2-4-0 for freight. These designs were widely copied by other railways both in the UK and overseas during the 1850s and 1860s.

Shifra Lerer

Shifra Lerer (August 30, 1915 – March 12, 2011) was an Argentine-born American Yiddish theater actress based in New York City. Lerer appeared opposite every major Yiddish theater actor during her career, which lasted 90 years. She was also cast in film roles, including the 1997 Woody Allen film, "Deconstructing Harry".
Her father, a manager at a soap factory, had immigrated to Argentina from the Russian Empire to escape anti-Semitism and poverty through the sponsorship of philanthropist and banker, Maurice de Hirsch. Lerer was born in the Santa Catalina colony in Argentina on August 30, 1915. Lerer was discovered in Buenos Aires by Yiddish theater legend, producer and actor Boris Thomashefsky, who was starring in the area, when she was just five or eight years old, at the recommendation of her sister (the actress Miryam Lerer). At ten she was participating in Yakov Botashanski's productions in a theater circle. When she was older, she studied at a Spanish-language drama school and performed for three years on the Argentinian stage. She then passed the examinations for the actors' union and became a member, playing with the star Miryam Karalova-Kambarov, then Moyshe Oysher and Florence Weiss, finally playing in serious drama roles with Zygmunt Turkov in "Urteyl, Hirsh Lekert, Ivan Kruger" and "Di glokn-tsier fun Notr-dam (The Bell-ringer (Hunchback) of Notre Dame)".
She played with Yakov Ben-Ami and Bertha Kalich in Wolf's "Profesor Malok", Strindberg's "Der Foter", and Leyvick's "Der poet is blind gevorn (The poet became blind)", with Samuel (Hymie) Goldenberg in Kalmanovich's "Hayntike kinder (Kids these days)" and with Maurice Schwartz in Singer's "Moyshe Kalb".
In 1943 she was invited by Samuel Goldberg to perform at the Parkway Theater in Brooklyn (owned by Hymie Jacobson and his brother Irving). Her first performance was in "Fun Niu York keyn Berlin"; she then toured concertizing at places like the Arbeter Ring, the National Yiddish Workers Union, and Camp Boyberik. In 1946 she went back to Argentina where she worked with Ben-Zion Witler at the "Mitre" theater and thereafter toured and performed with him (she married Witler in 1957 - he died from a brain tumor in 1961.). She joined the actors' union in 1949 and played in "Got, mentsh un tayvl" with Mikhal Mikhalesko and Gustav Berger. In 1952 she participated in Herman Yablokoff's production of Benyomin Ressler's "Onkl Sem in yisroel (Uncle Sam in Israel)" in the Public Theater in New York.
She ultimately decided to settle permanently in New York City. Lerer worked actively in the Yiddish theater circuit until she was 90 years old.
Her second husband, Yiddish actor Michael Michalovic, died in 1987. She was best friends with the late Yiddish theater actress, Mina Bern, who died in 2010.
Shifra Lerer died of a stroke in Manhattan on March 12, 2011, at the age of 95. She was buried in Block 67 of Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, Queens, next to her second husband, Michael Michalovic. The cemetery's Block 67 is reserved for who worked in New York City's Yiddish theater industry. Lerer was buried just rows from Boris Thomashefsky, who discovered Lerer at the age of 5 in Argentina. She had no immediate survivors.

Peter Shaw (physician)

Peter Shaw (1694–1763) was an English physician and medical author.
Life.
Shaw was the son of Robert Shaw, A.M., master of the grammar school at Lichfield. After passing some years of professional life at Scarborough, he was practising physic in London in 1726, apparently without a degree or the licence of the Royal College of Physicians, but did not permanently settle there until some years later.
On 25 June 1740 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians, being then a doctor of medicine, but of what university is not recorded. In London he attained popularity as a physician. He was patronised by Sir Edward Hulse, one of the court physicians, at that point gradually withdrawing from practice. He was admitted a candidate at the College of Physicians on 16 April 1753, and was made a fellow on 8 April of the following year.
In 1752 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to George II, and the same year was created doctor of medicine at Cambridge by royal mandate. Two years later he was promoted to be physician-in-ordinary to the king, and he was the usual medical attendant on George II in his journeys to Hanover. He was nominated to the same office on the accession of George III. He died on 15 March 1763, aged 69 years, and was buried in the nave of Wimbledon church, where there was an inscription to his memory.
Works.
He contributed to the study of chemistry in England by his translations of the works of Georg Ernst Stahl and Herman Boerhaave, as well as his own writings and lectures. Shaw was prolific if careless. He was editor of the works of Francis Bacon and Robert Boyle.
Shaw's translations or adaptations included:

Arthur Charles Evans

Arthur Charles Evans CBE (21 March 1916 – 18 March 2011) was best known as the author of "Sojourn in Silesia: 1940 - 1945", in which he recounts his experiences of his time in World War II, between 1940 and 1945, in the prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag VIIIB. 
Thousands of young men were incarcerated in Stalag VIIIB, in Lamsdorf, by the Germans during World War II. Evans recounted these experiences both in his book, as well as on his website, "Lamsdorf Remembered". The website was created due to public response from the children and grandchildren of former inmates of Stalag VIIIB, the website originally named "Lamsdorf Reunited" was created to record stories and photographs from that experience. Evans encountered the respected RAF pilot Douglas Bader while at Stalag VIIIB, and talked about his escape attempts in his book. Evans himself is mentioned in a book called POW: Allied Prisoners in Europe, 1939–1945 by Adrian Gilbert who used Sojourn in Silesia for his information. Evans was a member of The National Ex-Prisoner of War Association, whose patron is Dame Vera Lynn, DBE, LLD, M.MUS, and is mentioned in the August 2001 newsletter.
More recently on his website "Lamsdorf Remembered" a half-hour Radio Kent interview with Evans has been published, as well as a blog called Letters from Stalag VIIIB, which is made up of Evans' letters home during his 4 years as a prisoner-of-war.
Life.
Arthur Charles Evans was born in 1916 in the Wirral, Cheshire. The first years of his employment were at Lever Brothers, soapworks at Port Sunlight, and then with the New Zealand Shipping Company. One voyage to Australia and then another to New Zealand convinced him he was not meant to be a sailor. To further his ambition to become a policeman, he enlisted in the Irish Guards in 1936. In May 1940, he was wounded and taken prisoner in Bolougne and spent the remainder of the war in prison camps in Upper Silesia. He returned to England in May 1945 and upon demobilisation, joined the Kent County Constabulary.
Arthur was a close personal friend of James Callaghan and his wife Audrey Callaghan, Baroness Callaghan of Cardiff whom he had met when Callaghan was Parliamentary Adviser to the Police Federation from 1955 to 1960. They worked together during that time on negotiations for an increase in police pay. Whilst still a police constable Arthur was General Secretary of the Police Federation from 1956 to 1967 and it was in this capacity that he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) on 1 January 1967. In an article dated 19 August 1966, Police Federation General Secretary Arthur Evans complained that, because of the old anti-gun tradition, "you could count on the fingers of one hand police trained in the use of firearms."
Arthur was also responsible for policemen finally being allowed to buy their own homes. Up until then, they were at the mercy of the Chief Constables and being moved around the country.
In May 1967 Arthur organised and headed up the British contingent at The World Congress of Police Officers in Niagara Falls, Canada.
Arthur later returned to police work in Sevenoaks, Dover, Whitstable and Herne Bay, his last position being as an Inspector in 1970. He later became the chief of administration at Ashford Police Station (Ashford, Kent), a position he held until 1981.
He was married to his wife Freda for 62 years, and they have 3 daughters, Gillian, Kathryn and Vivienne, 5 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren. He retired aged 65, and spent much of his time gardening, bowling and cooking in his Kent home, and in later years caring for Freda. 
Evans died of natural causes on Friday 18 March 2011. He left a request for some of the profit from "Sojourn in Silesia" to go to the British Red Cross.

PO Corrèze

The PO Corrèze (POC) is a former metre-gauge railway in the Corrèze department in central France. The concession was granted to the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans (PO) and constructed by the Société de Construction des Batignolles. Together with the Chemin de Fer du Blanc-Argent and the Blois à Saint Aignan, they formed the metre-gauge network of the PO.
The centre of the railway was at Tulle, where there was a connection with the SNCF, and consisted of three lines:
There was also a connection with the Tramways de Corrèze (TC) at Saint Bonnet Avalouze. TC used POC tracks to reach Tulle.
The entire line was opened in 1904. It was closed to passengers on 3 November 1960 and to freight on 31 May 1970.
Steam traction was used throughout the duration of operation. Diesel traction appeared in the 1930s for passenger service in the form of "autorails" (railcars). Diesel locomotives arrived in 1962 to power the freight trains.
Permanent way.
Due to the difficult terrain, it was necessary to build a number of bridges, viaducts and tunnels.
Stations.
The station buildings were built in the style of the PO, with a combined station house and goods shed, with the roof extended over the loading dock. The stations at Tulle and Uzerche shared facilities with the SNCF. 
Rolling stock.
Steam locomotives.
Ten 2-4-0 tank locomotives were built by the Société de Construction des Batignolles for the opening of the line. Four 0-4-4-0 Mallet tank locomotives were ordered from Ateliers de construction du Nord de la France (Blanc-Misseron), who subcontracted the order to Ateliers de Tubize.
Addition stock.
A number of verhicles have also run on the PO-Corrèze

Holt Government

The Holt Government refers to the federal Executive Government of Australia led by Prime Minister Harold Holt. It was made up of members of a Liberal Party of Australia-Country Party of Australia coalition in the Australian Parliament from 26 January 1966 – 19 December 1967.
Background.
The Liberal Party of Australia-Country Party of Australia coalition had governed in Australia since 1949 under Prime Minister Robert Menzies. Menzies retired in January 1966 and the Liberal Party elected Harold Holt as party leader and he became Prime Minister of Australia.
Terms in office.
After being elected by the Parliamentary Liberal Party to served as leader and Prime Minister, Harold Holt led the coalition to victory in the November 1966 Australian Federal Election against the Australian Labor Party opposition led by Arthur Calwell. The Coalition won a substantial majority – the Liberals winning 61 seats and the Country Party 21 - with the Labor Party winning 41 and 1 Independent in the Australian House of Representatives (respresenting the largest parliamentary majority in 65 years). Following the 1966 election, Gough Whitlam replaced Arthur Calwell as Leader of the Opposition.
During his time in office, Holt increased Australian commitment to the growing War in Vietnam. His government oversaw conversion to decimal currency. Holt faced Britain's withdrawal from Asia by visiting and hosting many Asian leaders and by expanding ties to the United States, hosting the first visit to Australia by an American President, his friend Lyndon Johnson. Holt's government introduced the "Migration Act 1966", which effectively dismantled the White Australia Policy and increased access to non-European migrants, including refugees fleeing the Vietnam War. Holt also called the 1967 Referendum which removed the discriminatory clause in the Australian Constitution which excluded Aboriginal Australians from being counted in the census – the referendum was one of the few to be overwhelmingly endorsed by the Australian electorate (over 90% voted 'yes'). By the end of 1967, the Liberals initially popular support for the war in Vietnam was causing increasing public protest.
Death of Holt.
On 17 December 1967, Holt disappeared in heavy surf while swimming off Cheviot Beach, near Melbourne, becoming the third Australian Prime Minister to die in office. He was not formally declared missing until 19 December. Country Party leader John McEwen served as Prime Minister from 19 December 1967 to 10 January 1968, pending the election of a new leader of the Liberal Party of Australia. McEwen ruled out maintaining the Coalition if deputy liberal leader William McMahon became Prime Minister. John McEwen, leader of the Country Party, had been sworn in as caretaker Prime Minister until a new Liberal leader was elected. McEwen had ruled out further participation in the Coalition if William McMahon, the deputy Liberal leader, became Prime Minister. John Gorton won the leadership election with a small majority and resigned from the Senate to stand for election to Higgins, the House of Represensatives seat formerly held by Harold Holt, which he achieved on 24 February 1968.

Kulyaling, formerly Kulyalling, is a small town just off the Great Southern Highway located between Brookton and Pingelly in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia.
A railway siding named Westbrook was the origin of the town. The siding was established in 1905 and then the local progress association petitioned for a townsite to be declared. The townsite was gazetted in 1906 as Westbrook but the Lands Department sought to change the name as Westbrook was already in use. Two Aboriginal names were considered; Nimbedilling and Colyalling. The name was changed and the town was gazetted in 1907.
The name of the town comes from the Aboriginal name for a local water source and rock formation but the meaning is unknown.

George Seton, 7th Lord Seton

George Seton V, 7th Lord Seton (1531–1586) was a Lord of the Parliament of Scotland, Master of the Household of Mary, Queen of Scots and Provost of Edinburgh. He was the eldest son of George Seton, 6th Lord Seton and Elizabeth Hay, a daughter of John Hay, 3rd Lord Hay of Yester. His childhood and schooling were in France.
Political career.
Edinburgh and the Reformation.
George Seton was Provost of Edinburgh in 1557, and from time to time would send his carpenter, Robert Fendour, to the Burgh Council as his representative. In February 1558, George Seton was one of eight commissioners sent to Henry II of France to negotiate the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the Dauphin. On 29 November 1558, the Parliament of Scotland granted that Seton and the others had fulfilled their commission. In February 1559, the town council gave him funds to prepare a banquet for Mary of Guise on their behalf. 
However, Seton and the burgh council began to encounter difficulties, due only in part to the Scottish Reformation. Then, after rioting in Perth, Edinburgh was occupied by the Protestant Lords of the Congregation in June 1559. Seton tried unsuccessfully to protect the Blackfriars and Greyfriars monasteries. The Protestant Lords left Edinburgh in July, but made an agreement with Guise permitting freedom of conscience in religion. Seton, the Earl of Huntly and Châtellerault were asked to meet the people of Edinburgh to discuss the restoration of Mass in St Giles. According to John Knox, they met with refusal and the people would not allow the Mass in any other church. By the time the Lords of the Congregation occupied Edinburgh for the second time in October 1559, another rival council had already formed, lead by Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie. The Protestant lords retreated and Seton's council was re-instated. When the English army mobilised by the Treaty of Berwick arrived in April 1560, Kilspindie's council was back in power.
During the subsequent Siege of Leith in 1560, Seton fought for Mary of Guise against the Scottish Protestants and the English army. On 24 April he attacked the English camp at Restalrig. He was seized by an English cavalryman who broke his sword and staff, but was rescued by French musketeers. After the treaty of Edinburgh concluded the fighting, Seton sailed to France with the evacuees aboard the "Mynyon." In Paris in October 1560, he secretly met the English ambassador, Nicolas Throckmorton, asking him for a passport to return to Scotland through England. He managed to convince Throckmorton that he regretted his service of Mary of Guise and French causes. Seton had gained a French pension as a gentleman of the King's Chamber. He intended to take a portrait of Queen Mary and her letter to Elizabeth, but Mary disappointed him of this mission, saying the picture was not ready. Seton left France in November 1560, accompanied by an archer of the Scottish Guard called Alexander Clark, whose loyalty Throckmorton thought he had bought.
Mary in Scotland.
During the personal reign of Mary in Scotland George had a loyal inscription set in large carved letters and gilded above the entrance to Seton Palace;"UN DIEU, UN FOY, UN ROY, UN LOY"<br>One God for all time: One loyalty to the monarch. Lord Seton had dies made to strike gold and silver medals with the same motto, and a monogram with his initials and those of his wife, Isobel Hamilton, "GS-IH," with another motto "Nemo Potest Duobus Dominus Servire," from Matthew 6:24, "No one can serve two masters."
Mary was unsuccessful in proposing Seton as Provost of Edinburgh again in October 1561. Next year she made a better choice by backing Archibald Douglas (II) of Kilspindie, now associated with the success of the Reformation.
In March 1565, Seton fought a duel with Francis Douglas who was badly injured. The Earl of Morton and the Laird of Lethington tried to take legal action so Seton went to France. Thomas Randolph, the English diplomat, heard that Mary and Lord Darnley went to Seton Palace and were 'bedded' after their marriage at Holyroodhouse. Seton returned to Scotland in October 1565, during the Chaseabout Raid. He carried arms from France for Queen Mary. An English ship, the "Aid" tried to blockade Leith to prevent him docking, but was repulsed. Seton's cargo included three great horses for Darnley.
Days after the death of Lord Darnley, on 17 February 1567, Mary had a blue costume for her fool called George Steven delivered to her at Seton Palace, in April she was there with her council. With other supporters of Mary's marriage to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell Seton signed the Ainslie Tavern Bond on 19 April 1567.
Mary's marriage and continued rule in Scotland was opposed by the Confederate Lords. Mary stayed at Seton Palace before her capture nearby at the battle of Carberry Hill. She was then imprisoned at Lochleven Castle. She escaped to Seton's castle at Niddry but her supporters were defeated again at the battle of Langside. Seton was taken prisoner and early reports thought him killed. The son of Lord Ochiltree, John Knox's brother-in-law, would have killed him in revenge for his father's injury, but he yielded and was saved by James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray. Queen Mary went into England, where her companion, Seton's half-sister Mary Seton quickly joined her. With the other Marian lords Seton was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle where Mary was worried that he was at risk from plague. Seton was finally allowed to go into exile in France. Elizabeth I of England sent him a passport on 1 June 1569.
Supporter of the exiled queen.
Three Scottish supporters of Mary, the Duke of Châtellerault, the Earl of Huntly and Earl of Argyll gave Seton a commission to treat with the Duke of Alba, Viceroy of Lower Germany, as Mary's ambassador in August 1570. Seton was to ask for Spanish help to re-instate Mary in Scotland and expel her son's supporters who depended on English power. In September 1570, Lord Morley met him in the household of Katherine Neville, the Countess of the exiled Earl of Northumberland at Bruges. Seton told Morley that he had come to escort the Countess, who had previously sought refuge in Scotland, into France. The author of the "Historie and Life of James the Sext", recorded what must have been a popular account of the mission to the Duke of Alba. Seton tried to convince Alba to provide an army of 10,000 men by persuading the Scottish soldiers fighting against Spain to change sides. The soldiers were unresponsive until Seton himself was captured and tortured on the rack. The soldiers then mutinied only till he was released. There was an offer of money, but Alba could not spare the men, and Seton's mission was unsuccessful. Meanwhile in Scotland, the goods of his French stepmother, Marie Pieris, and half-brother Robert Seton were seized by Regent Moray's officers.
In January 1572, Seton was in the Spanish Netherlands with the Duke of Alba and still in contact with the Countess of Northumberland. Seton's return to Scotland through England prompted thorough searches of Scottish shipping in English waters. An Italian called Battista di Trento wrote a long letter to Elizabeth I of England in 1577, which alleged to reveal a plot some years earlier involving Seton and his sons, including Alexander, then a student in Rome. As part of the Ridolfi Plot, Mary would have married the Duke of Norfolk and be restored to the Scottish throne. Seton would pay to secure Edinburgh Castle on her behalf. Elizabeth would marry the Earl of Leicester. Battista laid out five schemes for the plot and the 19th century editor of William Cecil's papers believed his circumstancial details to show some "sub-stratum of truth" in his statements.
In May 1579, during the suppression of the Hamilton family, Lord Seton and three of his sons were ordered to enter ward at Brechin Castle. Seton pleaded with the King's keepers at Stirling Castle to mitigate their charge of treason. His son John Seton of Barnes, known as the 'Cavalier de Bucca' from his post at the Spanish court, had returned to Scotland and was suspected to have brought messages from the exiled Queen Mary. On 2 June 1581, Seton and two of his sons watched the execution of Regent Morton from a forestair on the Royal Mile of Edinburgh.
Ambassador in France, 1583.
After the collapse of the Gowrie Regime, Seton was sent as ambassador to France in December 1583. He was accompanied by William Schaw, Master of Works to James VI of Scotland. An English observer heard that the young Laird of Fintry, a Catholic, would accompany them to escape his excommunication from the Church of Scotland, and the Master of Livingston would go to bring Catherine, Duchess of Lennox, widow of Esmé Stewart, and her son Ludovic back to Scotland. A French diplomat, François de Rocherolles, Seigneur de Maineville, according to Sir Robert Bowes, was behind the mission and the choice of Lord Seton.
When he was selected for this embassy in September 1583, Seton wrote to Queen Mary from Seton Palace to explain his mission. He said he was to continue the league and amity with France, follow the advice of the Duke of Guise, and complete the treaty with her and her son. However, he wrote, her service was his principal motive. He explained that the poverty of King James was "so great that he could not carry out the least part of his plans." Seton had to pay for the voyage himself. He also mentioned that the English envoy Francis Walsingham had left Scotland on 15 (or 25) September 1583, and had a very poor reception and entertainment in Scotland. Seton was funded in part by the town of Edinburgh, who gave him a commercial mandate and contributed 2000 marks to hiring of Andrew Lamb's ship.
The Scottish embassy was keenly observed by the English diplomat, Sir Edward Stafford. Stafford noted Seton's audience with the French king in February 1584, supported by the Dukes of Guise and Joyeuse. Stafford said that Seton was lavish in his entertainment and display of silver plate, which resulted in a suspicion that he was funded by Spain. He thought that Seton's mission concerned a marriage for James VI to the Princess of Lorraine. By May 1584, Seton had run out of money and pawned his silver plate and the guns of the ship at Dieppe. Seton asked Stafford about the rebel leaders of the Raid of Ruthven who had fled into England, and Stafford wrote to Francis Walsingham that Seton was foolish in this conversation.
On 21 June 1584, Stafford remarked in another letter that Seton's phrases echoed those of Mary, Queen of Scots, and it was clear the two maintained frequent communication. After Seton's return to Scotland, de Maineville wrote to James VI in November 1584 that Seton had been earnest in this embassy (to reconcile Mary and James VI), but the time was not right. Primarily, France was anxious to maintain good relations with England.
Death and epitaph.
Seton remained in France till July 1585 or later. The Jesuit Robert Parsons wrote that he was uncertain whether to return or just send his son Alexander back to Scotland. (Although the ultra-Protestant Gowrie Regime was defeated, the political situation in Scotland was not as Seton had hoped) Back in Scotland, in January Sir John Colville twice noted him as ill in his letters, and he died in February 1586. On 22 June 1586, his son Alexander, Prior of Pluscarden, returned to Edinburgh council copies of their papers regarding French import duties sent with George to Henry II. George was buried at Seton Collegiate Church and his memorial has a lengthy Latin epitaph which also describes his children's careers. The Latin text is signed 'A.S.F.C.F.F.,' presumably referring to Alexander Seton as its author.
Family.
He married Isobel Hamilton, daughter of Sir William Hamilton of Sanquhar. Their children included;
Lord Seton's painter.
An anonymous portrait of Lord Seton was kept by the family of Hugh Somerville, 7th Lord Somerville, and is now part of the collection of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. It shows him with his baton of office as Master of Queen Mary's household, and may have been a commemorative piece made in later decades. The picture is reduced in size and the last figure of a date "157-" is missing. A motto on this painting, "in adversity, unyielding; in prosperity generous," matches an inscription recorded "under" a version of the painting at Seton Palace by Alexander Seton, 1st Viscount of Kingston; "In adversity patiens; in prosperitie, benevolus; Hazard yet forward." Seton's portrait is now attributed to Adrian Vanson. In January 1582, a painter in his employ, "Lord Seton's painter," was paid for drawing the King's portrait for coinage. The painter may perhaps have been Adrian Vanson or Arnold Bronckorst, who were both portrait painters to James VI. 
Seton was also painted in a family group by Frans Pourbus the Elder, now in the National Gallery of Scotland. 
The 18th century heraldic writer Alexander Nisbet described some of his additions to the interior of Seton Palace. Above the fireplace in the Great Hall were carved his coat of arms quartered with the Earl of Buchan encircled with a collar which Nisbet claimed to represent the Order of the Thistle. The ceiling of another room, called Samson's Hall, incorporated 28 armorial achievements of families of France, Scotland and Lorraine, "curiously embossed and illuminated." Viscount Kingston mentions seeing a mural painting on the end wall of the Long Gallery at Seton Palace, which he believed showed the exiled Lord Seton driving a wagon during his years of exile in France following the abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots.

Lu Dingyi

Lu Dingyi (; June 9, 1906 – May 9, 1996) was a leader of the Communist Party of China. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China and before the Cultural Revolution, he was credited as one of the top officials in socialist culture.
Biography.
Lu Dingyi joined the Communist Party of China in 1925, while he was studying electrical engineering at the Nanyang Public School. After graduation, he fully joined revolutionary activities, being mainly involved in the Communist Youth League, writing articles for its newspaper "Chinese Youth" (later renamed "Proletarian Youth" and then "Leninist Youth"). In 1927 he took part at both the 5th CPC National Congress and the CYL Congress, being elected a member of the CYL Central Committee working with its Propaganda Department. He was actively involved in countering Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist coup, organizing communist unities in Guangdong. In 1928 Lu Dingyi took part at the 6th CPC National Congress and the CYL Congress, both of which were held in Moscow, remaining in the Soviet Union until 1930 as a junior representative of the CYL to the Comintern.
Lu Dingyi then returned in China and participated at the Long March as an editor of the "Red Star" newspaper. He also worked with the Propaganda Department of the Eight Route Army, and was a member of the CPC Propaganda Department starting from 1934. In 1942 he was promoted to chief editor of the "Liberation Daily" after his predecessor Yang Song fell ill.
During the "Yan'an Rectification Movement", Lu Dingyi wrote "Our basic view for journalism", which was considered the basis for Chinese communist journalism. In 1943 he was appointed head of the CPC Central Propaganda Department, a post he held until 1952 and then again from 1954. He was elected CPC Central Committee member in 1945.
A political commissar in the PLA, Lu Dingyi gave important contributions to the revolutionary struggle in Shaanxi along with other top leaders like Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Ren Bishi, according to his official biography.
After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Lu Dingyi was deputy chairman of the Culture and Education Committee of the Central People's Government from 1949 and member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress from 1954. At the 8th Party Congress in 1956, he was re-elected a CPC Central Committee member and promoted to Politburo alternate member, concurrently serving as secretary of the CPC Secretariat from 1962. In 1957 and 1960, he accompanied major Party leaders Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping to international meetings of communist parties held in Moscow. His main political activity was in the cultural front, as he directed cultural criticism campaigns.
In 1959 he was appointed a Vice Premier of the State Council, and Minister of Culture in 1965. Shortly after, the Cultural Revolution broke out and Lu Dingyi was accused of being a promoter of the reactionary line in culture, since he didn't adhere to Mao Zedong's idea that culture should extensively serve proletarian politics. In May 1966 he was accused of being part of the "Peng-Luo-Lu-Yang anti-Party clique" (the others being Peng Dehuai, Luo Ruiqing and Yang Shangkun) and dismissed. He was also criticised for his activity in the Five Man Group, a Central Committee agency in charge of leading the first stages of the Cultural Revolution led by Peng Zhen, another purged official. He was detained for nearly 13 years.
Lu Dingyi was rehabilitated by the new leadership headed by Deng Xiaoping. In 1979 he was co-opted in the Fifth CPPCC National Committee as its vice-chairman; in the same year, he was co-opted in the CPC Central Committee as a consultant to the Propaganda Department. He was later a member of the Central Advisory Commission.
Lu Dingyi died in Beijing in 1996, several years after his retirement. He was hailed as an outstanding Party member and promoter of socialist culture. His knowledge of the English language also allowed him to translate the conversations between Mao Zedong and Anna Louise Strong.

Pension regulation

Pension regulation is a legal term encompassing the set of laws, rules and authoritative standards governing the pension industry, and the procedures needed to enforce them. 
Pension regulation varies widely from one jurisdiction to another - notably due to the persistence of discrepancies in the degree of autonomy and breadth of authority and discretionary power that national and regional pension regulators have at their disposal to enforce efficiently existing laws and regulations, in relation with local judicial practices and varying jurisprudential trends.
Pension regulation seeks to provide the various norms and standards needed to foster market efficiency, consistency, transparency and accountability across the pension industry: it is a key driver of pension funds’s risk management.
In Europe, in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, some pension experts such as Anton van Nunen have argued that excessive or misplaced regulatory activism can sometimes have negative unintended consequences, notably when it comes to the strict enforcement of asset liability matching in times high market volatility and the systematic use of bonds-based risk metrics across all asset classes.

Expatriate delicatessen

An expatriate delicatessen, expat foodstore or expat supermarket is a delicatessen "(European meaning)" that specialise in selling food and drink of particular country to expatriates and food enthusiasts who can't find such items in local food shops. These are usually set-up in areas of high expatriate areas to gain maximum sales or on-line. Unlike an ethnic grocer which tends to sell a mixture of products and goods, an expatiate delicatessen tends to sell items from one particular place such as Portugal or region like Eastern Europe. As they are specialised food stores, they charge high prices (usually several times their value) due to a lack of competition, high local duties and low orders from their suppliers. They also sometimes sell items in relation to the area like cooking equipment or native-language media that are hard to find in regular shops.
Items.
Examples of the items that are sold in these stores such as in an American expatiate delicatessen are Lucky Charms breakfast cereal, 3 Musketeers, Hershey's chocolate and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups confectionery, Fluff marshmallow spread, A1 steak sauce and Mountain Dew fizzy drink, while a Polish store sells jarred bigos, sauerkraut, gherkins, smetana and kielbasa wiejska sausage. Such items are usually either directly imported from the country or ordered through grey market importers. Some items are impossible to import as the local country bans them or controls their imports. For example, Mountain Dew is banned in the UK as it contains an ingredient (BVO) which is not allowed in the local food chain.

Lorenzo Panepinto

Lorenzo Panepinto (Santo Stefano Quisquina, January 4, 1865 - Santo Stefano Quisquina, May 16, 1911) was an Italian politician and teacher. He was the founder of the "Fascio dei lavoratori" (Workers League) in his hometown Santo Stefano Quisquina, editor of the newspaper "La Plebe" and member of the "Comitato della Federazione Regionale Socialista". He was killed by the Sicilian Mafia.
Early years.
Born in Santo Stefano Quisquina in the Province of Agrigento, he became a primary school teacher and an artist. His great passion was painting and the other was politics. In 1889 he was elected city councilor in the democratic-republican group inspired by Giuseppe Mazzini, challenging the traditional powers.
The latter reacted vehemently by dissolving the council and replace it with a Royal Commissioner. Nevertheless, the move failed to prevent a second defeat of the conservatives in the elections of August 1890. The government of Antonio di Rudini again dissolved the council and appointed a new Commissioner. Panepinto resigned in protest and dedicated himself to teaching and painting.
Organizing the peasantry.
He married and moved to Naples. Returning to Sicily in 1893, he noted the state of turmoil caused by the movement of the Fasci Siciliani. He set up the Fascio in Santo Stefano Quisquina, which was dissolved after only a few months by the Government of Francesco Crispi, who violently repressed the movement in January 1894. In the same year Panepinto joined the Italian Socialist Party. In an act of political reprisal, he was dismissed from his post of elementary school teacher by the municipality. Not discouraged, he continued to study pedagogy and educational methodologies and published two didactic volumes in 1897. 
In the early 20th century, with the resumption of agricultural strikes, Panepinto joined other peasant leaders like Bernardino Verro from Corleone and Nicola Alongi from Prizzi. They designed a change of strategy of political struggle, aiming to organise peasants in collective leaseholds through cooperatives and agricultural banks, to reduce dependence on the leaseholders ("gabelloto") of the large rural estates.
In the United States.
In 1907 he traveled to the United States. Many townspeople from San Stefano Quisquina had emigrated to the United States, in particular to Tampa, Florida, where they worked in the cigar-making industry. They had left their country, but not their radical ideas. They fitted in seamlessly with the labour culture of workers from Spanish and Cuban origin in the struggle for better labour conditions. 
But they also financially supported the setting up of the agricultural cooperative "Unione agricola" in their original hometown San Stefano Quisquina in 1902. They invited Panepinto for a trip that would last eight months.
Death.
On May 16, 1911, he was assassinated in Santo Stefano Quisquina, just before the entrance of his house, with two gunshots in the chest. At the funeral, over 4,000 people followed the open coffin in procession. His killers were identified among the "gabelloti" with links to the Mafia, but the material killer was released by the Court of Catania in April 1914. No one has ever been convicted for the crime. 
In Tampa the most popular socialist group of the city adopted his name after Panepinto’s assassination. The group pledged a yearly stipend of 1,200 lire to the socialist section in their former hometown for work among the peasantry
In October 1920, the socialists of Santo Stefano Quisquina managed to conquer the city hall again, electing as mayor Giuseppe Cammarata, Panepinto’s friend and collaborator, who continued the battle.

Eric Johnson (Australian sportsman)

Eric Alfred Johnson (17 July 1902 – 10 January 1976) was a South Australian sportsman who represented his state as both an Australian rules footballer and first-class cricketer. He played his league football for Norwood in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) and cricket with the South Australia cricket team in the Sheffield Shield.
Johnson wasn't selected in Norwood's 1925 premiership team, during his first league season, but was a member of their premiership side in 1929. He captained Norwood to a grand final in 1933, from fourth in the ladder, but they lost to West Torrens. A rover, he represented the South Australian interstate team on one occasion.
As a right handed batsman, Johnson played in six first-class cricket matches for South Australia. He had a modest record, only scoring 141 runs in ten completed innings, with a highest score of just 28. He took part in South Australia's 1927/28 and 1928/29 Sheffield Shield campaigns. 
Soon after his football playing career ended, Johnson was appointed Norwood's treasurer, a role he would hold for almost 40 years.

Ukraine at the Paralympics

Ukraine made its Paralympic Games début at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta, with thirty athletes competing in archery, track and field, powerlifting, swimming, and sitting volleyball. Vasyl Lishchynskyy won Ukraine's first Paralympic gold medal, in the shot put, and Ukrainians also won four silver medals and two bronze. Ukrainians had previously participated within the Soviet Union's delegation in 1988, and as part of the Unified Team in 1992. Ukraine, following its independence from the Soviet Union, missed out on the 1994 Winter Games, but made its Winter Paralympics début at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano. Ukraine has competed at every edition of the Summer and Winter Games since then.
Paralympic success.
Ukrainian athletes, competing as an independent country, have won a total of 238 Paralympic medals, of which 67 gold, 69 silver and 92 bronze, placing the country 23rd on the all-time Paralympic Games medal table. The country has won 173 medals at the Summer Games, and 65 at the Winter Games. It has won more gold medals, and more medals overall, than any other former member of the Soviet Union, apart from Russia.
In the 2000s, Ukraine became a major Paralympic power. While it had taken "only" seven medals at the 1996 Summer Games, it increased its tally to 37 in 2000, in Sydney. Though it won twenty silver medals at the Sydney Games, however, it won only three gold, and remained low-ranked on the overall medal chart. It ascended to the top ranks at the 2004 Games in Athens, sweeping up 55 medals, of which 24 gold, to finish sixth on the medal table. At the 2008 Games in Beijing, Ukrainians won 74 medals, of which 24 gold, and finished fourth – behind only China (1st), the United Kingdom (2nd) and the United States (3rd). 
Ukraine has also been highly successful at the Winter Paralympics, its best result coming at the 2006 Games in Turin, where it won 25 medals (of which 7 gold), to finish third, behind Russia (1st) and Germany (2nd). 
Valeriy Sushkevych, a former disability swimmer turned politician and member of Parliament, has been credited with "kick-startthe Paralympic movement in the country". He helped establish a national Paralympic centre in 2002, and ensured that Ukrainian Paralympians were granted a specific budget, which sports official Karina Matiazh said was Ukraine's "biggest achievement. [... have separate budgets for the Olympics and the Paralympics, whereas most other countries just get whatever bits and pieces are left over from their Olympic budget". Four-time Paralympic swimming champion Maksym Veraksa described Sushkevych as "a father figure" concerned with "each and every athlete".
"Lviv Today" noted in 2010 that "Ukraine’s Paralympic team has experienced a major boost in the amount of training and support it receives in recent years", resulting in "extraordinary" progress at the Winter Games in particular: "finishing 18th in Salt Lake City in 2002, Ukraine rose to 3rd (2nd in terms of actual number of medals won) in Turin in 2006". The "China Daily" in 2008 remarked that, in terms of the proportion of its medals in relation to the number of its athletes, Ukraine was "clearly punching above its weight". "New Disability" notes: "The only country which has consistently been amongst the top medal winners in both recent summer and winter Paralympic Games is Ukraine. This is due to a major strategy by Ukraine to support Paralympic Athletes".
Among Ukraine's most successful athletes is Viktor Smyrnov, who won five gold medals (as well as a silver and a bronze) in swimming (disability category 11) at the 2004 Summer Games. Ukraine also won the men's football 7-a-side competition at the 2004 Games, and successfully defended their title in 2008. Ukrainians have, in addition, won gold medals in track and field, cross-country skiing and biathlon, as well as one in powerlifting in 2004 (Lidiya Solovyova in the women's up to 40kg) and one in wheelchair fencing that same year (Andriy Komar in the men's épée individual, category B).

Karen LaMonte

Karen LaMonte (born December 14, 1967 in Manhattan, New York) is an American artist known for her life-size sculptures in ceramic, bronze and cast glass as well as her large scale monotype prints.
Background.
LaMonte grew up in Manhattan, New York. In 1990, she graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) with a Bachelor in Fine Arts with honors. Immediately after college, she was awarded a fellowship at the Creative Glass Center of America, in Millville, New Jersey. Following that, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, and worked at UrbanGlass, a not-for-profit public access glass studio. During this period, she pursued artwork in blown and cast glass, which were exhibited at fine art galleries.
In 1995, LaMonte met Steven Polaner, whom she later married. In 1998, they moved to the Czech Republic, where LaMonte was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to pursue the use of large-scale cast glass in her artwork.
Artwork.
During her Fulbright year, LaMonte began working at Zdenek Lhotsky's Pelechov glass casting studio in Železný Brod in Eastern Bohemia - most famously associated with Stanislav Libenský and Jaroslava Brychtová, an artistic team often credited with the first studio glass sculptures. While here, she developed "Vestige", a cast glass life-size sculpture of a dress, which took one year to complete and required the development of special technologies, including the introduction of the lost wax technique to Czech glass casting studios. "Vestige" was to become a seminal artwork, the beginning of an important body of work with far reaching influence on the field of contemporary art and glass.
LaMonte's exhibition profile, which includes the Czech Museum of Fine Art in Prague, the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Virginia, and the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington, as well as her inclusion in the permanent collections of museums such as The Smithsonian Museum of American Art, Renwick Gallery, Washington DC, The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, the Musée des Arts décoratifs, Paris, France, and The National Gallery of Australia, Canberra marks her as a major contemporary artist.
Her art deals largely with the central themes of beauty and loss, exploring the fragility of the human condition through a sartorial lens.
Her work has been critically acclaimed and written about by art critics such as Arthur Danto. In his 2005 essay "The Poetry of Meaning and Loss: The Glass Dresses of Karen LaMonte", Danto wrote about "Vestige":
The dress belonged to a moment when the wearer was, to use an expression of Proust’s, "en fleur". The dress belonged to a certain moment of history, which it preserves—it shows how women dressed for certain occasions at a certain moment. The wearer will have aged. She looked like that then, but, if she is still alive, it is certain she will not look that way now. There is a double melancholy—the melancholy of fashion, and the melancholy of bodily change, from nubility to decrepitude. The breasts have fallen, the waist thickened, the skin has lost it transparency and luminescence. The poignancy of LaMonte’s dresses is a product of two modes of change in which we participate as human beings, composed, as we are, of flesh and meaning. Their poetry is the poetry of beauty and loss.
LaMonte's newest body of work draws inspiration from Japan, exploring the same themes through a different cultural lens.

Rivalries.
Kuznetsova vs. Henin.
Belgian tennis legend Justine Henin was one of Kuznetsova's leading rivals during the middle portion of her career. Of the 19 matches that they played, Kuznetsova earned three monumental victories, including their final one. Henin won their first meeting in the 2003 Wimbledon Quarterfinal when Kuznetsova, just 17, lost in straight sets. Kuznetsova earned her first win over the Belgian at the semifinals of the 2004 Total Qatar Open, where she went on to lose in the final to Anastasia Myskina. This result projected the Russian into the world's top 20 players for the first time. Arguably their finest match followed in the fourth round of the 2005 French Open, where Henin saved two match points en route to a 7–6(8-6), 3-6, 7-5 victory. Henin went on to win the tournament that and the following two years, beating Kuznetsova in the 2006 final. Henin additionally defeated Kuznetsova in the finals of the 2007 US Open grand slam tournament in straight sets. Sveta beat Henin for the second time in the finals of the 2007 Qatar Telecom German Open tournament in Berlin by a score of 6–4, 5–7, 6–4, becoming the second-to-last person to do so in 2007. The Belgian went on a seven-month, 32-match winning streak after Wimbledon, having lifted the French Open directly beforehand. Henin in 2008, but returned to the tour briefly in 2010, only to suffer an elbow tear at Wimbledon. Justine Henin made one final comeback following her injury at the 2011 Australian Open, where Kuznetsova defeated her in a dramatic match, 6–4, 7–6(8) in the third round. Due to the recurring nature of her elbow injury, Henin retired immediately following her match with Kuznetsova, making the Russian the final person to play against and defeat her.
Kuznetsova vs. Radwańska.
Kuznetsova and Agnieszka Radwańska have played each other thirteen times since 2007, with Kuznetsova leading the head-to-head 10–3. Their first meeting was at Wimbledon in 2007 with Kuznetsova winning in straight sets. Kuznetsova won their first three meetings, but in the four meetings that eventuated in 2008, Kuznetsova lost three of them, including in the third round of the Australian Open and in the fourth round of Wimbledon. Additionally, she also lost against her at the year-end championships later in the year, after Radwańska replaced an injured Ana Ivanovic. Kuznetsova has subsequently dominated Radwańska in future meetings, winning the last six meetings between the pair, the most recent being an upset victory at the 2012 French Open. Kuznetsova's two most recent titles came by defeating Radwańska in the championship match, first at Beijing in 2009 and then at San Diego in 2010.
Kuznetsova vs. Ivanovic.
Kuznetsova and Ana Ivanovic have played each other twelve times since 2005, with Ivanovic leading the head-to-head 9–3. Ivanovic dominated their meetings on a regular basis; she won the pair's first encounter at the 2005 Miami tournament in what was the Serb's first ever appearance in the main draw of a Tier I tournament in which she was not required to qualify. Kuznetsova, however, won their meeting in Sydney in 2006; it was the Russian's only victory against Ivanovic outside of the Fed Cup. They have met in two finals, both going Ivanovic's way: first in Berlin in 2007 and at Indian Wells in 2008, the latter of which they played as the top two seeds. Additionally, at the 2007 WTA Tour Championships, Kuznetsova lost to Ivanovic in three sets on the Serb's 20th birthday. Kuznetsova has only beaten Ivanovic twice since 2006, both in Fed Cup matches (2010 and 2012). Their most recent meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 2014 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix with Kuznetsova losing in three sets.
Fed Cup participation.
Kuznetsova joined team Russia in 2004 in the doubles and singles competition. Her teammates were Myskina and Zvonareva in singles and Likhovtseva in doubles. They competed against Australia in the first round in the Luzhniki Stadium in an indoor carpet court. Kuznetsova defeated Molik and Molik/Rennae Stubbs. The end result was 4–1 for Russia; Myskina lost to Molik. 
In the quarterfinal they faced Argentina in Buenos Aires. Kuznetsova lost to Gisela Dulko. In the doubles she defeated Dulko and partner Patricia Tarabini. The final score was the same as in the first round, 4–1. 
In the semifinal they faced Austria. Again in Moscow, Kuznetsova defeated Yvonne Meusburger, Daniela Kix and Meusburger and Patricia Wartusch all in straight sets. The final score was a straight 5–0. In the final they faced France only three days after the semifinal. Kuznetsova beat Dechy, but lost to Tatiana Golovin. Russia won the final 3–2 for its first Fed Cup victory.
Kuznetsova did not participate in the next two years. She rejoined in 2007 and defeated Spain's Lourdes Domínguez Lino and Anabel Medina Garrigues in the quarterfinal. She was elected in the final that year. There, she won against Mara Santangelo and Schiavone from Italy. Russia again won that year's Cup.
The next year she again participated. Playing against the United States she defeated 282nd-ranked Ahsha Rolle in the semifinal. In contrast, Kuznetsova lost the doubles competition with partner Elena Vesnina, beaten by Liezel Huber and Vania King. In the end, Russia defeated the US 3–2. In the final, Russia defeated Spain as it had the prior year. Kuznetsova won against Carla Suárez Navarro and Garrigues. Team Russia won the 2008 Fed Cup with 4–0.
In 2009 Kuznetsova joined the group again. She played against China in the quarterfinal and won in the singles over opponent Zi Yan, and in the doubles, together with Dementieva, over Tian-Tian Sun and Zi Yan, after losing the first set. Russia won against China in a straight 5–0 final scoreline. Russia lost to Italy in the semifinal. Kuznetsova was the only winner, defeating Pennetta.
At the 2010 Fed Cup, Russia defeated Serbia in the quarterfinal 3–2. There, Kuznetsova won two of three matches, beating Ivanović, and Ivanović and Janković in doubles, with partner Kleybanova. She lost to Janković.
Kuznetsova joined the Russian team in 2011. In the first round they faced France on 5 and 6 February. In the first round, Kuznetsova was defeated by Alizé Cornet, but defeated Virginie Razzano a day later. She teamed up with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and defeated Cornet/Julie Coin in the doubles. Russia became just the fourth nation to come back from 0–2 down in a Fed Cup tie since the best-of-five-match format was introduced to the World Group in 1995. Russia defeated Italy in the semifinal in 5–0. There, Svetlana Kuznetsova defeated Roberta Vinci. Russia succeeded, the first time since 2008, in a final in the Fed Cup. Russia, however, lost against Czech Republic in 3–2.
The first round of the 2012 Fed Cup saw three wins in the single competition, two of which were made by Kuznetsova, the first against Silvia Soler Espinosa, the second against Carla Suárez Navarro. The pair Kuznetsova/Petrova retired in their last match due to Kuznetsova's fatigue, but Russia still won in 3–2. Team Russia lost against the Serbian team in the semifinal, 2–3. Although winning the first match against Ana Ivanovic in three sets, Kuznetsova was later defeated by Jelena Janković in two straight sets.
Coaches.
Kuznetsova received training at the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Barcelona, Spain from the age of 14 and was coached under direction of club president Emilio Sánchez and Sergio Casal. Her major coaching relationship was with Stefan Ortega who was a regular guest in her player's box and helped advance her game.
After a series of poor finals' results Kuznetsova ended her relationship with the Sanchez-Casal academy in 2009 and moved to Moscow on the advice of Roger Federer to start training with experienced Russian coach Olga Morozova. They ended their relationship after the BNP Paribas Open in March 2009, after which Kuznetsova was without a coach. As of May 2009 her coach was former Russian tennis player and Fed Cup coach Larisa Neiland. She was coached for a short period by Loïc Courteau after trying unsuccessfully to convince Mauresmo to coach her. Her next coach was for a short time the former Spanish tennis player Carlos Cuadrado, until he was replaced with her former coach Neiland. After the loss in the Italian Open, Kuznetsova has switched to Morozova, then to Amos Mansdorf and finally in May 2012 to Argentine Hernán Gumy, former coach of Marat Safin. She said in an interview, "I really enjoy working with ...he's, I think, someone who I was looking for for a very long time. I understand him perfectly." With his help she won three matches in straight sets at the 2012 French Open, including claiming the scalp of then-World No. 3 Agnieszka Radwańska. Her wish is "to go back to [her level."
Playing style.
Svetlana Kuznetsova plays right-handed and has a two-handed backhand. She is an all-round player. She is noted for her great speed on court and her strong forehand with much topspin. She is capable of producing effective volley winners providing an agile touch. According to Richard Pagliaro of ESPN, "Kuznetsova can alter the spin, speed and height of her shots and owns the variety that plays well on clay" but since her recent failures, "consistency has eluded her, and she's prone to flakiness and frustration under pressure." Jeff Cooper of about.com meant her greatest strengths were the "outstandingly powerful and accurate forehand. Strong topspin on forehand and backhand. Solid serve. Great speed" and outlined her basic style as "power baseliner" with "no major weakness". She is known for her unpredictability and inconsistency.
Endorsements and popular culture.
Kuznetsova extended her long standing endorsement agreements with the sport brand Fila on 13 January 2012. She debuted with the new apparel at the 2012 Australian Open alongside fellow Fila player Kim Clijsters. According to chairman Gene Yoon, "Both players are longtime members of the Fila family and have played an important role in Fila's rich history in tennis."
However that contract was not extended beyond 2012 and subsequently, shortly before the start of the 2013 Australian Open, Kuznetsova signed a new apparel endorsement deal with Chinese sports apparel brand Qiaodan.
Svetlana Kuznetsova appeared in video games Top Spin 3, Virtua Tennis 2009 and Virtua Tennis 4 as a playable character.

Georgii Stackelberg

Baron Georgii Karlovich Stackelberg () (July 30, 1851 – 1913) was a cavalry general in the Imperial Russian Army during the late 19th century and early 20th century.
Biography.
Stackelberg was from a Baltic German noble family and graduated from the Nicholas General Staff Academy in 1862.
As a commander in the 1st Semirechye Cossacks from 1874–1876, Stackelberg distinguished himself during the Russian conquest of the Khanate of Khiva and the Kokand expedition of 1875 under General Konstantin von Kaufman. He was wounded in combat, and although nominated for numerous awards, he refused to accept any.
From August 18, 1886 to December 5, 1890 Stackelberg commanded the 25th Dragoon Regiment at Kazan. He was then assigned to command the Trans-Caspian Cossacks until December 3, 1897, followed by the 15th Cavalry Division to May 31, 1899.
Stackelberg was commander of the Russian 10th Cavalry Division during the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China and Russian occupation of Manchuria. Afterwards, he was assigned command of the 2nd Siberian Army Corps from April 25, 1901 to February 11, 1902. He was then commander of the 1st Cavalry Corps from February 11, 1902 to February 3, 1904.
From April 5, 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, Stackelberg was commander of the Russian 1st Siberian Army Corps, which played a major role in the Battle of Te-li-Ssu. Hampered by orders from Russian commander-in-chief General Aleksei Kuropatkin not to commit his entire reserves, and to fight a defensive battle rather than push forward in an offense, his forces were decisively defeated by the Second Japanese Army under General Oku Yasukata. In the subsequent Battle of Sandepu, Stackelberg chose to ignore Kuropatkin’s orders and made gains against entrenched Japanese positions, albeit with heavy casualties, but was forced to withdraw when reinforcements were denied. Relieved of his command for insubordination, he was sent back to St Petersburg after the battle, where he was awarded the Order of St. George (4th class) for his actions.

In their second-innings he scored 12 runs, before being dismissed by Amar Singh. Burdett made a single stumping in the match, stumping Ahmed Baporia from the bowling of P. Ramsey-Brown. The following year he played his second and final first-class match, this time for Hyderabad against Karachi. In the Hyderabad first-innings, Burdett scored 37 runs before being dismissed by D.O. Daulatram. In the Karachi first-innings he stumped opening batsman Abdul Aziz and caught behind Abbas Khan and Hyder Ali. Burdett scored 49 runs in his two first-class matches, ending with a batting average of 12.25.
Burdett married Hebe Etheldreda Ellen Curwen Collis on 17 November 1919. They had two children: Elizabeth Sylvia Burdett (1921–1984) and Arlingham Jerome D'Arcy Burdett (1922–1995). Burdett spent his later life in England, where on 13 September 1962 he died in Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire.

Cambridge University Library, Ff. i.27

Cambridge University Library, Ff. i.27 is composite manuscript at the University of Cambridge. It was formed by adding a 14th-century Bury St Edmunds book to a compendium of material from 12th-century northern England (items 1 to 11 in #Contents). The latter compendium had once been part of Corpus Christi College Cambridge MS 66. With its original content, it had at one time been at Sawley Abbey, though it was probably produced somewhere else, perhaps Durham.
Ff. 1.27 as a whole came together in the 15th century or later, but pages 1 to 236 are earlier and paleographic evidence suggests that, with the exception of a continuation of Gildas' "De excidio Britanniae" dating to the 14th century, the material therein shares the same origin. Ff. i 27 and Corpus Christ 66 manuscripts probably had a common origin with Corpus Christi College Cambridge MS. 139 ("CCCC 139") as well, part of Ff. 1.27 being written in the same hand as part of 139's version of the "Historia Regum".
Contents.
Pages 253 to 471 are occupied by later material including, among other works, Gerald of Wales's "De Descriptione Hybernie", his "Expugnatio Hibernica", "Vita Sancti Patricii Episcopi", with most of the rest afterward being material relating to Wales.

She is in awe of her Mr. Perfect 'Bava' and takes his help to achieve big in studies. Surprisingly, she surpasses him and becomes the first ranker. Balu gets deeply hurt by this and he resorts to cunning ways to deviate Mahalakshmi. But to his surprise Ajith (Anand) stands first this time. Meanwhile Mahalakshmi's father brings her a marriage proposal, but she doesn’t want to marry him. Balu and Mahalakshmi compromise by agreeing to help each other. Balu helps her in getting the proposal canceled and Mahalakshmi starts deviating Ajith from studies for the sake of Balu, but Balu gets tempted to her in bathroom. When the couple is heading to fall in love, Mahalakshmi unknowingly hurts the ego of Balu and they get separated.
After three years they meet again in the hospital because their grandmother suddenly falls ill. While trying to find out how Balu is doing, Mahalakshmi realizes he hadn't changed at all. Both argue a lot until their parents try to get them married. Surprisingly, Balu mentions that he has a girlfriend named Swapna that he hopes to marry. While introducing her to his family, Mahalakshmi notices that Swapna is much more than she is. To get back at Balu, she agrees to get married to Ajith, Balu's former rival in college. Ajith turns out to be the head of a company that makes more than Balu's company. Balu, angry that Ajith is greater than he is, puts his company in risk in hopes that he can surpass Ajith's company. Unfortunately, his partner cheats him, and Balu is on the verge of losing his company. Mahalakshmi works hard to help him out of the hard time as his new project manager.

Bill Luxton

William Robert Luxton (born 1940) is a Falkland Islands farmer and politician who served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Camp constituency from the 2009 general election until his resignation in 2011. Luxton was also a Member of the Legislative Council from 1989-2001, and served on the Executive Council of the Falkland Islands in the 1980s.
Luxton was born in the Falkland Islands and educated in the United Kingdom before moving back to the islands to manage his family's farm at Chartres. In 1982 Argentina invaded and occupied the Falklands for 74 days during which time Luxton was identified by the Argentine military junta as a potential troublemaker. Along with his wife, Patricia, and their children, Luxton was deported to the UK where he became notable for giving numerous interviews about his experiences with the Argentine military. Luxton and his family returned to the islands at the end of the Falklands War.
Luxton's portfolios in the Falkland Islands Government included Civil Aviation, Development Corporation, Aquaculture and Rural Development. Luxton is noted for his strong criticism of Argentina's policy on the Falkland Islands. Luxton resigned from the Legislative Assembly in 2011 due to his prologued absence from the Falklands, which was increasing the workload on other MLAs. He was replaced by Ian Hansen in an uncontested by-election.

Chäserrugg

Chäserrugg (or "Käserrugg") is a mountain in Wildhaus-Alt St. Johann municipality, Toggenburg, canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland, rising to 2,262 m.
It is the easternmost of the "seven peaks" of the Churfirsten, the other six being, running east to west, Hinterrugg (2,306 m), 
Schibenstoll (2,234 m), Zuestoll (2,235 m), Brisi (2,279 m), Frümsel (2,263 m), Selun (2,205 m).
In spite of its being counted among the "seven peaks", it has a modest prominence of just 14 m, forming part of the ridge ascending to Hinterrugg. 
Part of Toggenburg's ski resort, it is reached from Unterwasser (911 m) by funicular (opened 1934) to "Iltios" (1,339 m) and from there by aerial lift (opened 1972). 
The mountain's name translates to "cheesemaker's ridge" and is properly the name of the ridge ascending towards it from the north, beginning at "Ruggschöpf" at about 1,800 m and was only transferred to the "peak" when the "seven Churfirsten" were systematized in the late 19th or early 20th century; in the 19th century, there was also a fashion of etymologizing the name of the Churfirsten range as "Kurfürsten" "prince-electors", which occasionally inspired a name variant "Kaiserruck" "emperor's back" for Chäserrugg.

List of places of worship in Horsham (district)

There are more than 110 current and former churches and other places of worship in the district of Horsham, one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex. The large, mostly rural district, whose largest town is also called Horsham, has 86 places of worship in use as of , and a further 27 closed churches which, although still standing, are no longer in religious use. The area has a long history of Christian worship—in both the main population centres (Horsham, Billingshurst, Henfield, Pulborough, Steyning and Storrington) and the surrounding villages and hamlets—and many Anglican churches have Norman or even Saxon work. Roman Catholic places of worship include chapels within convents and priories, including England's only Carthusian monastery, as well as modern churches. Protestant Nonconformity has been well established since the 17th century. Plymouth Brethren are well represented in the north of the district; Baptists, Methodists and United Reformed Church worshippers have many churches; William Penn lived and preached in the area, which still has a strong Quaker presence; and one of eight chapels belonging to a now vanished local sect, the Society of Dependants, still stands at Warnham. There is also a mosque in Horsham town.
English Heritage has awarded listed status to nearly 50 current and former church buildings in Horsham district. A building is defined as "listed" when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of "special architectural or historic interest" in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status. Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of "exceptional interest"; Grade II* is used for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest"; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of "special interest". As of February 2001, there were 38 Grade I-listed buildings, 60 with Grade II* status and 1,628 Grade II-listed buildings in the district of Horsham.
Overview of the district and its places of worship.
Horsham is a large, mostly rural district in southeast England, which covers about of land between the North and South Downs. Much of the land is part of the Weald, some is heavily forested, and large parts are classified as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. More than one-third of residents live in the ancient market town of Horsham, which has grown rapidly since the 19th century to support a population of 45,000. The next largest settlements are the villages of Billingshurst, Henfield, Pulborough, Steyning and Storrington. These and many other villages and hamlets within the 32 civil parishes have ancient churches, particularly from the 13th century. Clockwise from the south, the district is bordered by the districts of Adur, Arun and Chichester in West Sussex; the borough of Waverley and the district of Mole Valley in the county of Surrey; the West Sussex borough of Crawley and district of Mid Sussex; and the city of Brighton and Hove.
The Christianisation of Sussex began with St Wilfrid in the 7th century, though, and gained pace in the 8th century when St Cuthman arrived at Steyning and founded St Andrew's Church. The densely forested Weald had been a stronghold of pagan worship, but by the 9th century Sussex was "at least nominally, a Christian county" due to the work of travelling missionaries such as Cuthman, who spent their lives preaching and founding places of worship.
In common with other parts of Sussex, many early churches were simple "two-cell" buildings with a nave and chancel. As worship became more elaborate, settlements grew larger and building techniques improved, many of these Saxon-era structures were extended or replaced, and Norman or early Gothic architecture characterises many of Horsham district's churches. Many ancient churches were restored in the Victorian era—sometimes drastically, as at Amberley, Ashington, Billingshurst and Wiston, for example—for several reasons. New theological and ideological practices within the Anglican church, associated with the Oxford Movement and the Cambridge Camden Society, defined new architectural ideals for churches to follow. Those that lacked the required features, such as large chancels, chancel screens and a separate nave, were identified for restoration, as were churches with newly unfashionable features such as box pews and galleries. In other cases, apathy and declining congregations had led to serious structural decay over the course of several centuries. Meanwhile, population growth in larger settlements necessitated enlargements or rebuildings in some cases. Gordon Macdonald Hills, who conducted "particularly damaging restorations" at more than 30 Sussex churches, was especially active in the Horsham area, but other architects such as Samuel Sanders Teulon, Henry Woodyer, John Loughborough Pearson, George Gilbert Scott, Jr. and R.H. Carpenter also left their mark on the district's old churches in the 19th century.
Roman Catholic worship in the area has had an unbroken history since before the English Reformation, despite being outlawed for centuries by various Acts of Parliament. Rich families such as the Wappingthorns at Steyning and the Carylls at West Grinstead maintained the faith, sometimes using secret rooms to celebrate Mass. Example survives in the Priest's House next to the 19th-century Church of Our Lady of Consolation and St Francis in West Grinstead, and possibly at Henfield. Mass was sometimes said in private houses (as at Henfield) before permanent churches were built, and three of the district's present Roman Catholic churches are linked to monasteries and convents. Public worship takes place in the chapels at St Hugh's Charterhouse Monastery at Parkminster and The Towers Convent in Upper Beeding, and the Priory Church of Our Lady of England in Storrington is physically linked to the Premonstratensian monastery there.
Protestant Nonconformist worship has had a long and successful history in the area. Many denominations founded chapels and meeting places between the 17th and 19th centuries, both in the towns and in rural areas; many survive and remain in use. Baptist worship never gained such a hold as it did in East Sussex, but Horsham town became a hotbed of the Strict and Particular Baptist cause in the 19th century, when three such chapels were founded: Hope, Rehoboth and Jireh. General Baptists became established in the 1660s under the leadership of radical evangelist Matthew Caffyn, the first leader of Horsham General Baptist Chapel (1721). Members of the chapel founded a mission at Billingshurst in 1754; both causes moved towards Unitarianism in the 19th century, and both chapels are still used. The later Brighton Road General Baptist Church also founded two offshoot chapels. The Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist movements were also focused on Horsham. Wesleyan worship at a chapel in the town's London Road dates from 1832. Outreach work to surrounding villages led to the founding of chapels in Southwater (now demolished), Dragon's Green, Faygate, Mannings Heath and Partridge Green. The United Reformed Church, into which the Congregational Church merged in 1972, has four congregations in the district; several other chapels fell out of use while still registered as Congregational, and one at Henfield became Evangelical. The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) had a presence in towns and villages across the district from the 17th century, despite repression. William Penn lived at Warminghurst and preached there and at a former meeting house in Steyning, now called Penn's House; he was also linked to the curiously named Blue Idol, a Quaker place of worship since 1691. Horsham's meeting house dates from 1834, but the community worshipped in houses or in the open air long before that. Plymouth Brethren, meanwhile, maintain a strong presence in Horsham town. Their cause was helped by the support of Charles Eversfield of Denne Park, who founded their first meeting house in 1863. Three other meeting rooms survive in the town. The Anglican church was strongly opposed to the denomination in the 19th century, seeing it as an "irritant" locally. Other extant places of worship for Christian Scientists, The Salvation Army and Jehovah's Witnesses exist, and denominations such as Presbyterians, Mormons, Swedenborgians, Pentecostalists and the obscure, localised Society of Dependants formerly worshipped in the district. The last named sect, also known as "Cokelers", established eight chapels in Sussex and Surrey in the 19th century, often with co-operative shops nearby. Warnham's old chapel was used until the 1970s, as was the associated shop.
The only non-Christian place of worship in the district is a mosque, which found a permanent home in Horsham town centre only in 2008: the community used houses and industrial buildings previously. The former Jireh Independent Baptist Chapel, which passed out of religious use in the mid-20th century, became Madina Mosque after Horsham District Council granted planning permission in 2008.
Religious affiliation.
According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, 122,088 people lived in Horsham district. Of these, 76.34% identified themselves as Christian, 0.37% were Muslim, 0.22% were Buddhist, 0.19% were Hindu, 0.18% were Jewish, 0.08% were Sikh, 0.36% followed another religion, 15.44% claimed no religious affiliation and 6.82% did not state their religion. The proportion of Christians was much higher than the 71.74% in England as a whole, and other religions not listed in the Census were also followed by more people than the national average (0.29%). The proportion of people with no religious affiliation was also higher than the national figure of 14.59%. The proportion of Buddhists was slightly lower than the 0.28% national figure; and adherents of Islam, Hinduism, Judaism and Sikhism were much less prevalent in the district than in England overall. In 2001, 3.1% of people in England were Muslim, 1.11% were Hindu, 0.67% were Sikh and 0.52% were Jewish.
Administration.
All Anglican churches in Horsham district are part of the Diocese of Chichester, whose cathedral is at Chichester, and the Archdeaconry of Horsham—one of three subdivisions which make up the next highest level of administration. In turn, this archdeaconry is divided into eight deaneries. The churches at Billingshurst, Broadbridge Heath, Colgate, Coolhurst, Itchingfield, Lower Beeding, Mannings Heath, Nuthurst, Partridge Green, Roffey, Rudgwick, Rusper, Shipley, Slinfold, Southwater, Tisman's Common, Warnham and West Grinstead, and the four in Horsham town, are in the Rural Deanery of Horsham. Those at Amberley, Ashington, Ashurst, Botolphs, Bramber, Buncton, Greatham, Parham, Pulborough, Steyning, Storrington, Sullington, Thakeham, Upper Beeding, Washington, West Chiltington and Wiggonholt are part of the Rural Deanery of Storrington. Cowfold, Edburton, Henfield and Shermanbury's churches are within the Rural Deanery of Hurst. Two churches in the southwest of the district—at Coldwaltham and Hardham—are in the Rural Deanery of Petworth.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton, whose cathedral is at Arundel, administers the district's eight Roman Catholic churches. Those at Billingshurst, Pulborough and Storrington are in Cathedral Deanery; Steyning and Upper Beeding's churches are part of Worthing Deanery; and the churches at Henfield, Horsham and West Grinstead are in the Crawley Deanery.
Three Baptist churches in the district are part of the South Eastern Baptist Association, which administers about 150 churches of that denomination across southeast England. Brighton Road and Trafalgar Road Baptist Churches in Horsham town are in the Association's Gatwick Network. Upper Beeding Baptist Church is in the Mid Sussex Network. Brighton Road Baptist Church in Horsham set up a daughter church in the Littlehaven area of town in 1993. The Life Community Baptist Church now meets at a school, and is also part of the South Eastern Baptist Association's Gatwick Network.

Shadow Hunters

Players are secretly assigned the role of a character belonging to one of three factions: "Shadows", which are supernatural creatures of the night, "Hunters", which are humans attempting to exterminate the Shadows, and "Neutrals", which are unaffiliated characters who are caught in the crossfire with individual victory conditions.
Each player does not know the identity or allegiance of any other player, and must use cards, negotiation, and guesswork to figure out who everyone else is. The game ends when one or more players have fulfilled their victory conditions. At this point all players who have fulfilled their objectives are declared winners, whether they are part of the same faction or even alive.
Setup.
First, shuffle the six area cards and place them randomly on the designated spots on the game board. Next, shuffle the White, Black, and Hermit decks separately and place them face down on the marked area on the side of the board. Now each player must choose a color and place one piece in the "No Damage" circle on the board (the HP piece) and one piece in front of them for now (the Player piece). Shuffle the Shadow, Hunter, and Neutral character decks face down separately, and looking at the table below, pick out the appropriate amount of cards from each deck and hand them out face down to players randomly. Make sure that other players cannot see your character card when you receive it. Once you have your character card, read over it to see your affiliation, your special ability, and your victory condition. Finally, randomly determine the starting player and begin the game.
Gameplay.
Turn order proceeds in a clockwise fashion. On a player's turn, he or she must move their character by rolling the dice and moving their player piece to the area card corresponding to the number they rolled. If a seven is rolled, the player may choose where they want to move, given that it is not the same area that they are currently on. Next, the player may choose whether or not to use the ability stated on the area card. Finally, a player may decide if they want to attack another player within range.
Areas.
Areas are the locations where player characters will land on and interact with. Listed below are the six area cards and what action players may choose to perform when they land on them.
Card Types.
Single-Use Cards: Cards that are placed in their deck's discard pile immediately after play. When a deck runs out of cards, its respective discard pile is shuffled and made into the new deck.
Equipment Cards: Cards that the player keeps in front of them when played. They are always in effect when in front of a player. There is no limit to how many equipment cards a player may have.
Hermit Cards.
The Hermit deck contains only Single-Use cards. Hermit Cards are used to help determine what character and allegiance another player is. When a player draws a Hermit card, they should read what is printed on the card carefully, then hand it face down to the player that they would like to learn more about. The other player will then silently read the card, and if their character matches what is stated on the card, they must suffer the card's effects. If not, the other player must simply say "nothing happens." The player receiving the card may not lie about their character unless they are the "Unknown" character.
White and Black Cards.
Both the White and Black decks contain Single-Use cards and Equipment cards. White Cards are usually beneficial for either the player drawing them or for others. The White deck contain equipment cards that benefit the user through defensive and supportive means. Black Cards are usually used to inflict damage on other players, but will sometimes inflict damage randomly or even harm the user. The Black deck contains equipment cards that benefit the user through offensive means.
Combat.
At the end of a player's turn, they have the option of attacking another player within range. The default range is the area card that the player is currently on and the adjacent area card that is paired with it. Some Black equipment cards have the ability to modify a player's attack range. When a player makes an attack, they roll both dice and inflict the amount of damage equal to the difference between the numbers (higher number - lower number) rolled to the enemy player. Attacks made against multiple opponents, which is permitted by a specific Black card, are made by rolling the dice and inflicting that amount of damage to all targets.
Death.
As a player takes damage during the game, they move the HP piece onto the number on the board corresponding to how much damage they currently have. HP pieces are used to show the damage levels of all players. A player's character dies when they have accumulated damage equal or more to the HP listed on their character card. When a character dies, the player must flip their character card face up if they have not already and remove their HP piece and Player piece from the board. If a player has killed another player, they are allowed to take one Equipment card from the dead player and discard the rest.
Characters.
Each character possess a special ability that they may use when they reveal their character by flipping their character card face up. The exceptions to this rule are "Daniel" and "Unknown", whose powers are always active. Listed below are all the characters, their affiliations, and their special abilities.
Victory.
A player wins if they fulfill the victory condition stated on their character card at any time during the game. Once a player's victory condition is reached, they may immediately flip their character card face up if they have not already and declare victory, ending the game. All players who have fulfilled their characters' victory conditions by the end of the game are considered to be winners, making it possible for multiple players, even if they are on opposing teams, to win. If a player's character is dead but their victory condition is fulfilled by the end of the game, they are still considered to be a winner.

Mark the Deacon

Mark the Deacon () was a monk in the Egyptian desert of Scetes who became the biographer of Saint Porphyrius in the 5th century. He was, at a later date, made deacon of his church. To effect the sale of the property still owned by Porphyrius in his native city, Mark set out for Thessalonica and, upon his return, the proceeds were distributed among the monasteries of Egypt and among the necessitous in and around Jerusalem. His masterpiece, the ""Vita S. Porphyrii"" ("Life of St. Porphyrius), formerly known only in a Latin translation, was published in 1874 by M. Haupt in its original Greek text. A new edition was issued in 1895 by the Bonn Philological Society.

Lupeol

Lupeol is a pharmacologically active triterpenoid.
It has several medicinal properties, one being anti-inflammatory. A 1998 study found lupeol to decrease paw swelling in rats by 39%, compared to 35% for the standardized control compound indomethacin.
Natural occurrences.
It is found in a variety of plants, including mango, "Acacia visco" or "Abronia villosa". It is also found in dandelion coffee.
Synthesis.
The first total synthesis of lupeol was reported by Gilbert Stork "et al".
Recently, in 2009, Surendra and Corey reported a more efficient and enantioselective total synthesis of lupeol, starting from ("1E,5E")-8-[("2S")-3,3-dimethyloxiran-2-yl]-2,6-dimethylocta-1,5-dienyl acetate by use of a polycyclization.
Biosynthesis.
Lupeol is produced by several organisms from squalene epoxide. Dammarane and baccharane skeletons are formed as intermediates. The reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme lupeol synthase.
Pharmacology.
Lupeol has a complex pharmacology in humans, displaying antiprotozoal, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antitumor and chemopreventive properties. One study has also found some activity as a Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor at high concentrations (in the millimolar range).
It is an effective inhibitor in laboratory models of prostate and skin cancers.
Mechanism of action.
As an anti-inflammatory agent, lupeol functions primarily on the interleukin system. Bani et al. (2006) found lupeol to decrease IL-4 (interleukin 4) production by T-helper type 2 LUEOL cells.

Devil Dogs of the Air

Devil Dogs of the Air (a.k.a. "Flying Marines") is a 1935 Warner Bros. propaganda film, directed by Lloyd Bacon and starring James Cagney and Pat O'Brien, reprising their earlier roles as buddies after making their debut as a "buddy team" in "Here Comes the Navy". "Devil Dogs of the Air" was the second of nine features that Pat O'Brien and James Cagney made together. The film's storyline was adapted from a novel by John Monk Saunders.
Plot.
Lieut. Bill Brannigan (Pat O'Brien) invites friend and hotshot pilot Tommy O'Toole (James Cagney), the self-styled "world's greatest aviator", to join the USMC Reserve Aviator training program. O'Toole arrives and promptly starts to move in on Brannigan's love interest, Betty Roberts (Margaret Lindsay), and in typical cocky fashion, antagonizes nearly everyone else. Although not temperamentally suited for the military, O'Toole completes primary training and after surviving an accident, eventually realizes that he is willing to change. After a competition in the air with his friend Brannigan, and for the attentions of Betty, there is a predictable conclusion with O'Toole coming out the victor.
The film has a Warner Bros. tribute to the Navy Department, to the officers and men of the Marine Corps and the fleet for their invaluable co-operation.
Production.
Principal photography starting on October 1, 1934, was based at the US Naval Base San Diego. One of the featured squadrons stationed there, Marine Attack Squadron 231 (VMA-231) after returning to San Diego in 1928, had traded in its World War I-era O2B-1s for new Curtiss F8C-1s and F8C-3s, which were soon redesignated OC-1s and OC-2s. Equipped with Vought O3U-6 Corsairs, the squadron continued to operate from San Diego and participated in the annual Fleet Problems, operating from the carriers , , and at different times. Shortly after receiving the F8C/OCs, the squadron, along with VO-10M took part in the filming of the 1929 movie "Flight" and later, prominently appeared in the "Devil Dogs of the Air". 
The rare U.S. Marine Corps Curtiss RC-1 air ambulance, "A-8864", made an appearance in the film. Other unusual types that appear in the film include:
Maneuvers (wargames) by the United States Navy and the USMC are the actual "stars" of the movie. In the film, the USN represented the BLUE Force while the enemy was the BROWN Force. 
Reception.
Released in an era of patriotic films with overt propaganda themes that set the scene for war preparations, "Devil Dogs of the Air" received a mildly appreciative public acceptance. Although it had a major release in 1935, the film was re-released in 1941, just before America's entry into World War II, again finding a receptive audience. Critic Leonard Maltin described it as a "tiresome potboiler with Marine Air Corps rivalry between Cagney and O'Brien. Their personalities and good stunt-flying scenes are the only saving grace." Mainly considered hackneyed, it was best considered an aviation film and today, represents an authentic look at the period.

The Hyslop Field Research Laboratory is an agricultural research facility operated by the Oregon State University Crop and Soil Science Department. Also known as The Hyslop Farm, it is located on Highway 20 about half way between Corvallis and Albany, Oregon.
History.
The Hyslop farm was named after George Hyslop, who was hired by Agronomy Department founder Henry Scudder when he opened the department in 1907. The two of them originally taught all 14 courses. In 1916, the Agronomy Department was divided into 4 departments, including Farm Crops with George Hyslop as its head.
In 1929, the land was purchased that became the Hyslop Agronomy Farm.

In Nazi Germany, Sonder- und Ehrenhaft ("special or honorable detention") was an administrative status assigned to certain particularly prominent political prisoners, notably political leaders of Nazi-occupied countries and disgraced members of the German elite. Because of their political value or former status, they were treated uncommonly well, and all but a few of them survived the war.

The Nazi regime classified its political prisoners into numerous categories, including
The latter category also included the "personal prisoners of the "Führer"" – opponents of the regime too prominent to be killed outright, as well as people like Hitler's failed assassin Georg Elser, who was initially kept alive with the intention of putting him on a show trial after the war.
Prisons.
The "SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt", led by Heinrich Himmler, was responsible for the detention of the "Sonder- und Ehrenhäftlinge". It built special detention centers for these prisoners in or near several concentration camps. Most of these facilities were much more comfortable than the camps' normal prisoner barracks.
As the war wore on, the SS increasingly requisitioned a great number of hotels, castles, palaces and mansions and repurposed them as detention centers. These included:
Several other detention centers for high-level prisoners were planned. Albert Speer was charged to rebuild the Schwarzburg castle in the Schwarzatal, Thuringia, for this purpose, but the project was eventually abandoned. Inspired by the American prison of Alcatraz, SS officers searched the Baltic Sea coast for a suitable location of an island prison. In 1942, the SS decided to use the Pakri Islands near Baltischport (now Paldiski in Estonia) for this purpose, but the German defeat at Stalingrad put this position at risk and the project was also abandoned.
Conditions.
The conditions under which the "Sonder- und Ehrenhäftlinge" were detained ranged from comfortable to luxurious, depending on their status. The prisoners did not have to work, were allowed to wear civilian clothing and ate the same food as their guards. After the war, Ernst Kaltenbrunner testified at the Nuremberg Trials that the prominent prisoners at places like Hotel Ifen or Bad Godesberg received "a triple diplomat's ration, that is to say, nine times the ration of a normal German during the war, as well as a bottle of "Sekt" each day."
Many detainees were allowed to receive visits by their family or to have their spouses live with them, and some of the highest-ranking prisoners, such as King Leopold III of Belgium, were allowed a small retinue of servants and followers. However, the prisoners normally had to pay for the cost of their detention. Kurt Schuschnigg, for instance, whose assets the Nazis had confiscated, was billed even for the cost of his relocation to Sachsenhausen.
List of "Sonder- und Ehrenhäftlinge".
The following is an incomplete list of notable "Sonder- und Ehrenhäftlinge". Unless noted, the people listed here survived their detention.

Guy Lagneau

Guy Lagneau (1915 - 16 December 1996) was a French architect, one of the founders of Atelier LWD, who was involved in many major projects in France and Africa.
Early years.
Guy Lagneau was born in 1915.
He was a pupil and admirer of the architect Auguste Perret, whose later reconstruction of Le Havre (which was devastated during World War II) was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
He participated in setting up the Pavillon of Modern Times for the International Exposition of 1937.
As a student at the École des Beaux-Arts, in the Perret-Courtois studio, he designed a hotel at the edge of a lake, with a symmetrical but rhythmic structure of exposed reinforced concrete. This design was published in 1942 in a polemic article written by Michel Roux-Spitz, an opponent of traditionalist architecture.
Lagneau played a very active role in the 3rd Perret studio in the 1942–1954 period, following the advice of Le Corbusier.
Lagneau was among the architects who collaborated with Perret on the project to rebuild Le Havre, involved in the northern section.
During the summer of 1945, he worked with André Le Donné, André Hermant and José Imbert to prepare the first draft of the new city plan, synthesizing the work of other architects, from which Perret developed the final plan submitted on 26 September 1945.
1950s.
Lagneau broke with the architectural principles of his master, Perret.
He believed in light architecture, more like that of Le Corbusier. 
Through his work in Africa, he became deeply interested in the relationship between architecture and climate.
In 1952 he founded the Atelier LWD, with Michel Weill and Jean Dimitrijevic, a partnership that was active from 1952 to 1987.
Their first major project was the Hotel de France in Conakry, Guinea, designed in 1953 and completed in 1954.
This was a long, seven-storied building, supported by pillars, with a restaurant located in a circular pavilion.
The interior and furniture were designed by Charlotte Perriand and Jean Prouvé in 1953.
In March 1958, Lagneau unveiled the House of the Sahara, a home-made prototype made in collaboration with Weill, Dimitrijevic, Prouvé and Perriand. In this work, they proposed a modern answer to the question of housing under extreme climatic conditions by applying the principle of separation.
The house consisted of cabins cooled by air-conditioning in the day, but open at night onto the desert, all housed in a large tent that creates the central living space. This project was followed in 1958 by studies of tropical habitat in Guinea, resulting in a report which proposed concrete solutions for living in the humid tropics.
Museum of Modern Art at Le Havre.
Lagneau was chosen by Georges Salles, director of National Museums, to undertake construction between 1952 and 1961 of the first major museum built in France after World War II, the Museum of Modern Art at Le Havre.
Lagneau undertook the work in collaboration with Raymond Audigier, Michel Weill and Jean Dimitrejvic.
The museum, inaugurated in 1961 by the Minister of Culture, André Malraux, was one of the key elements of the reconstruction of Le Havre.
The museum departs from the tradition of closed museums cut off from the exterior world. Lagneau worked closely with the curator, Reynold Arnoult to develop a flexible space in harmony with the marine environment. 
Facing the sea, the museum is a smooth and transparent assembly of glass and steel posed on a concrete pad. 
Installed above the roof, the aluminum louver blades were created by the engineer Jean Prouvé, providing control over the natural light that floods the building.
"Le Signal", a concrete sculpture by Henri Georges Adam, frames a fragment of the landscape and strongly emphasizes the exceptional situation of the building at the harbor entrance.
Later years.
Lagneau was asked by Jean Millier to review the urban plans for Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire in 1960.
Lagneau acted as an advisor to the Institute of Urban Planning and Development of the Paris Region, helping prepare master plans for creation of new towns between 1962 and 1965.
In designing the seat of the new department of Essonne, he was influenced by what he had seen in the planned city of Brasilia. Thus he proposed a large body of water with the prefect's office in the center, flanked on each side by the courthouse and departmental Assembly. Inspired by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange, who designed a city build on blocks to allow free movement on the ground and easy installation of equipment, Lagneau decided to place the administrative buildings on pillars.
However, these plans were modified due to their cost. The buildings were arranged according to his plan, but were placed on the ground. Lagneau was unhappy but was forced to accept the decision.
Lagneau, was architect of the Prefecture and the Palace of Justice of Évry, Essonne with Michel Weill and Jean Dimitrijevic in 1975.
In the late 1970s he designed the Quatre-Temps shopping center in La Défense, a business district of Paris, which opened in 1981. It was the biggest commercial centre in Europe at the time, and transformed the district.
The Quatre-Temps reflects the values of lightness, sophistication and flexibility.
