Thiruparkadal

Thiruparkadal (Tamil: திருப் பாற்கடல்) has a rarest among the rare, temple in the country, where Thirumal stands on God Siva to show the world, the amalgamation of Vaishnavism with Saivism and to enlight both of them are one and the same.
Salient Features.
Thiruparkadal village, known as Karapuram in ancient times, is a scenic fertile area surrounded by greenish fields and is the site of two Sivan temples and two Vishnu temples. This is the location where Lord Vishnu lay on Adisheshan to prevent the gushing Sarasvathi river from disrupting and destroying the "yagha" performed by Lord Brahma to seek the grace of Thirumal at Kanchipuram.
Vishnu on Palar River Bed.
Lord Vishnu lays on Adisheshan to prevent the Saraswathi river called 'Vegavathi' at three places. One at Pallikonda [Uthara Ranganathar] near Vellore, Then at Tiruparkadal, And finally at Kanchipuram where the temple is called Tiruvekka where the deity holds the name 'Yathothrakaari'.
Vishnu Stands on Sivan.
It is an interesting part. It is said that one Vaishnava Maharishi named Pundareegar visited Thiruparkadal to have Darshan of Sri Ranganatha swami. But he found a Siva lingam into the sanctum Sanctorum named Sree Doseswarar instead of Vishnu, by seeing this he was disappointed and returned.
Lord Vishnu wanted to fulfill the aspiration of the Vaishnava devotee, and transformed himself as an old vaishnavite, and enquired Maharishi. Maharishi shared his disappointment with old vaishnavite. But the old man insists that it is only Thirumal Sannathi and asked the Maharishi to visit the temple once again, and accompanied the Maharishi to temple and then disappeared. Maharishi walked right into inner Sanctum of the temple and seen the Thirumal with Abhaya Mutra standing on Siva lingam. This was on Ekadasi day, and from on that day the presiding deity is called as Sri Prasanna Venkatesa Perumal. This temple is hailed as the place to show the devotees that Siva and Hari are one and the same. Every year on Vaigunda Ekadasi day, a number of devotees visit this temple. Another vaishnavite temple called as Sri Ranganathar temple is situated at the side of the Prasanna Venkatesa perumal temple.
Temple Architecture and Significance.
The Rajagopuram of Sri Prasanna Venkatesa Perumal temple is in dilapidated state. Next to it is, Kodimaram, Pundareega Pushkarani and an altar, small mandapam and Maharishi Gopuram welcomes us. There is another mandapam in the entrance of Sanctum Sanctorum which has also Shrines for Thumbikkai Azhwar, Nammalwar, Madurakavi Azhwar, Thirumangai Azhwar, and Boothathazhar.
Inside inner sanctum, the presiding deity lord venkatesaperumal stands on Avudaiyar (Siva lingam) with Abhaya Mutra. It is a most memorable and pleasurable moment to have Darshan of Both Hari and Siva. There are carvings of Krishna Devarayar, Dhalavan Naicken, Rani Mangammal, Aranganayagam and Aranganayaki, all in praying pose.
The Sprawling temple renovated by the king of Vijayanagar. Krishna Daverayar has also shrines for Alamelu mangai thayar, Anjaneyar, Karudazhwar, Desikar, Rukmani, Sathyabhama, Thirukkachi nimbi adigal. This temple was patronized by Krishna Daverayar, and hence inside the Sactum, there is an idol of him.
Thiruparkadal - 107th Divyadesam.
Beside Sri Prasanna Venkatesa Perumal Devasthanam, Sri Ranganathaswamy Devasthanam is present which makes the place to be called as 107 th Divyadesam. Bakthi period of Tamil Literature. There are interesting stories about 108 Divya Desams which belongs to perumal, i.e. Vishnu. Out of 108 Divya desams, 106 only situated in the Earth. Thiruparkadal(107) and Paramapadam(108) were said to be situated at Extra terrestrial universe. The God wanted all the devotees to visit all the 108 Divya desams and hence created ‘Sayana position’ at Thiruparkadal. These details were produced by the Vaishnava scholar Shree Madapoosi Azhwar.

Mark Lesko

Mark J. Lesko (born February 4, 1967) is the Executive Director of Accelerate Long Island. He is a former American politician and Assistant U.S. Attorney.
Accelerate Long Island is a regional collaboration among Long Island's major research institutions, including Brookhaven National Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Hofstra University, the North Shore-LIJ Feinstein Institute, Stony Brook University, and the business community to commercialize research and create high tech startup companies.
Biography.
Lesko is a native of Washington D.C. He is a graduate of Yale University, where he was a quarterback on the varsity football team. In 1994, Lesko received his law degree from Georgetown University Law School, graduating on the Dean's list and serving as a Notes Editor of the Georgetown Immigration Law Journal.
On August 15, 2012, Lesko was selected by the Board of Directors of Accelerate Long Island to become the organization's first Executive Director.
In 2009, Lesko was the Democratic candidate for the open Brookhaven Town Supervisor position, which was vacated by Democrat Brian X. Foley. Lesko's opponent for the special election to fill the seat was a town councilman, Republican Tim Mazzei. The special election for town supervisor was held on March 31, 2009 and Lesko topped the sitting Councilman Mazzei with almost 55% of the vote. Supervisor Lesko beat Martin Haley in the general election on November 3, 2009, receiving 56% of the vote. Supervisor Lesko won his third term on November 8, 2011 against Republican Challenger Cecile Forte with nearly 60% of the vote.
Lesko practiced law at firms in Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. He then served as Assistant U.S. Attorney for 10 years, from 1999-2002 in the District of Columbia and 2002-2009 in the Eastern District of New York.
Lesko and his wife Karen reside in East Setauket, New York.
Accelerate Long Island.
In 2011, Lesko spearheaded an initiative as Brookhaven Town Supervisor to commercialize research at Long Island's major research institutions, including Stony Brook University, Hofstra University, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, North Shore-LIJ Health System and the Long Island Association. The effort was modeled after other successful commercialization efforts around the country, like Connect.org in San Diego and other high-tech economies in Silicon Valley and Boston. Subsequently, Accelerate Long Island was launched as a not-for-profit organization with the research institutions and several private companies serving on the Board of Directors. After hiring an interim director, the Board of Directors unanimously tapped Mark Lesko to be the organization's first Executive Director. Lesko was charged with transforming Long Island's economy by cultivating an ecosystem that connects researchers with entrepreneurs and investors and creating high-technology jobs.
As Executive Director of Accelerate Long Island, Lesko is responsible for overseeing the organization's $500,000 seed fund. Lesko is also working on bringing more venture capital dollars to Long Island from places like New York CIty.
Lesko administers the Accelerate Assist mentorship program and Accelerate Ecosystem networking program. The Accelerate Assist program includes a team of experienced entrepreneurs-in-residence that mentor early stage high tech startup companies.
Accelerate Long Island is working with over 100 high tech startup companies in the information technology, biotech, and energy sectors. The goal is to create an innovation cluster of high tech startups on Long Island.
Major Initiatives As Supervisor.
As Supervisor, Lesko made it a priority to take the politics out of Brookhaven government. Lesko forged a partnership with a Republican Councilwoman, Deputy Supervisor and Councilwoman Kathleen Walsh, and appointed a new bi-partisan management team.
Lesko applied fiscally conservative principals to Town government. He froze property taxes for three years in a row and cut spending in the General Fund by 26%.
Lesko supported a property tax cap, a spending cap, and a debt management cap for Brookhaven Town, and voters overwhelmingly approved all three measures, which were referendums on the ballot in November 2010. Wall Street Rating agencies affirmed Brookhaven’s high bond ratings eight times when Lesko served in office.
Lesko focused on economic development in the Town and is the brainchild of Accelerate Long Island, an initiative to connect research conducted at Long Island's major universities and research institutions and connect them with entrepreneurs to create start-up companies on Long Island.
Lesko also focused on redeveloping the blighted areas of the suburbs and redirecting development away from virgin land through a program he developed called "Blight to Light".
A hallmark economic development project of Supervisor Lesko is the Ronkonkoma Hub Transit-Oriented Redevelopment, which seeks to create a live-work destination 50 acres of Brookhaven owned property adjacent to the busiest train station on the entire Long Island Rail Road and proximate to Long Island's major commercial airport, Long Island MacArthur Airport.
Career as Assistant United States Attorney.
Lesko served as Deputy Chief of the Long Island Criminal Division, where he ran the U.S. Attorney's Office on Long Island leading all federal investigations and prosecutions in Brookhaven.
Some of his successful cases as Lead Prosecutor include:
Mark also has overseen and managed the federal prosecutions leading to conviction in:

Salvia madrensis

Salvia madrensis (Forsythia sage) is a yellow-flowered "Salvia" native to the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range in Mexico, growing at 4,000-5,000 elevation in warm, wet areas. The specific epithet "madrensis" refers to the high mountains where it grows.
"Salvia madrensis" spends the first part of the growing season putting out 4-7 foot stems that are thick (2 inches) and square, with ridges on each corner emphasizing the squareness. The rough, heart-shaped spinach-green leaves are widely spaced on the stem, graduating in size from large at the bottom to smaller at the top, giving a lush covering to the plant. Numerous 12 inch inflorescences are covered with softly colored butter-yellow flowers held in whorls. The calyces are aromatic and covered with sticky glands. Blooming begins in late August, lasting until frost.

Ron Hayes

Ronald G. Hayes (February 26, 1929 – October 1, 2004) was an American television actor who, as an activist in the environmental movement, worked for the establishment of the first Earth Day, observed on April 22, 1970. He was a member of the Sierra Club and a founder of the ecological interest group, Wilderness World. In his acting career, Hayes appeared primarily on westerns, but he also had starring or recurring roles in several series, including "The Everglades", "The Rounders", and "Lassie".
Biography.
Hayes was born to Sam Hayes and the former Marion de Rode Brune in San Francisco, California. Both parents were heavily involved in the theater and acting. Hayes graduated in 1952 from nearby Stanford University in Palo Alto with a degree in foreign relations. At Stanford, Hayes met a young Slovak student, Vladimir Kovalik, who would become his best friend for life. The two had a passion for climbing and were particularly active in the Stanford Alpine Club. Together they climbed many peaks of the Sierra Nevadas and beyond. They also fought with considerable success to protect the pristine beauty of Grand Canyon National Park.
Hayes was a United States Marine in the Korean War. After military service, Hayes worked for radio station KSJO in San Jose, California.
In 1957, Hayes moved with his wife, Joan, and their three children, Vanessa (born 1952), Peter, and Heidi, to Hollywood to launch an acting career. He was soon cast in his first engagement in 1957 as Jeff Miller in the episode "A Case of Sudden Death" of the NBC legal drama "On Trial", or "The Joseph Cotten Show" starring Joseph Cotten. He was further cast as Lieutenant Harry Summers in the episode "Family Portrait" of Lee Marvin's NBC police drama, "M Squad".
Hayes appeared with Walter Coy, Paul Birch, and Robert Knapp in the 1959 film "Gunmen from Laredo", the story of a man seeking revenge for the murder of his wife and the unlikely path to closure for his grief.
1960s.
In the 1961-1962 season, Hayes appeared in all 38 episodes as Lincoln Vail, officer of Florida's Everglades County Patrol, in the half-hour syndicated adventure series "The Everglades". After "The Everglades", Hayes appeared in more Westerns, including the last season of NBC's "Laramie" in two episodes "Shadow of the Past" and "Protective Custody". He then appeared in Jeffrey Hunter's "Temple Houston" as Lambert in the episode "Billy Hart" and on "The Virginian" as Marshal Brett Cole in the episode "Siege", both on NBC. From 1960 to 1964, Hayes appeared as different characters in eight episodes of "Wagon Train". In 1964, he appeared once on John Gavin's "Destry" as Jethro Jellico in "Blood Brother-in-law". In 1965, he was cast as Jamie Brewster in the episode "A Long Way Home" of Robert Horton's ABC series, "A Man Called Shenandoah".
Hayes' marriage to Joan ended in a bitterly contested divorce. Early in 1965, he married Betty Endicott, a stunt actress on NBC's "Bonanza". Hayes himself appeared six times on "Bonanza" in episodes "Desert Justice" (1960) as Hurd Cutler, "The Rescue" (1961) as Johnny Reed, "Mirror of a Man" (1963) as Jud Lally and Rube Barnes, "The Bridegroom" (1966) as Jared Wilson, "Night of Reckoning" (1967) as Donnie Buckler, and "Emily" (1969) as Deputy Marshal Wade McPhail.
From 1966, Hayes co-starred as Ben Jones in M-G-M's short-lived ABC comedy-Western series "The Rounders" about cowpokes on a Texas cattle ranch, with Chill Wills as rancher Jim Ed Love and Patrick Wayne, a son of John Wayne, in the role of Howdy Lewis. Other co-stars included Walker Edmiston and Strother Martin.
In 1967, Hayes appeared twice as George Moran on NBC in the "Gallegher" episodes of "Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color", with Roger Mobley in the title role. He appeared that same year in several episodes of the ABC soap opera "General Hospital".
In 1968, he appeared in the last episode of the first season of "Ironside", 'Return of the hero'.
Hayes remained in demand for appearances on television westerns, having guest starred twice in 1968-1969 on NBC's "The High Chaparral" in the episodes "Threshold of Courage" and "A Fella Called Kilroy". Hayes appeared in eight segments of James Arness's CBS series "Gunsmoke", including the role of Floyd Coleman in the well-remembered two-part episode "Snow Train" (October 1970). His other appearances were in "Moo Moo Raid" (1960) as Cary, "Harriet" (1961) as Hoagler, "Old Faces" (1961) as Milt Varden, "Jenny" (1962) as Zel Meyers, "I Call Him Wonder" (1963) as Jud Sorrell, and "The Judas Gun" (1970) as Boyd Avery.
Later career.
From 1969 to 1972, after Robert Bray, as Forest Ranger Corey Stuart, had departed the series, Hayes appeared seven times on CBS's "Lassie", six of those in 1971-1972 in the role of rancher Garth Holden. His co-stars at the time were Larry Pennell, as his brother, and Larry Wilcox as a friend of his son's.
In 1979, Hayes portrayed a Sheriff Pinter in Arness's ABC series "How the West Was Won". Otherwise, most of his work in the 1970s was on drama series, including Raymond Burr's "Ironside" on NBC and "The Mod Squad" on ABC. He also appeared in three CBS series, Jack Lord's "Hawaii Five-O", William Conrad's "Cannon" (as Harry Gibbons in the episode "Press Pass to the Slammer"), and Buddy Ebsen's "Barnaby Jones" (as Sheriff Oscar Hamlin in "Target for a Wedding").
His last recurring work was as Hank Johnson in 1980-1981 in six episodes of CBS's prime time soap opera "Dallas". Thereafter, in 1983, he appeared as Tim Coulton in "Children of Jamestown" of NBC's "The A-Team" starring George Peppard.
Hayes died at the age of seventy-five of complications of a subdural hematoma as the result of a fall near his residence in Malibu in Los Angeles County, California. He was survived by his three children and five grandchildren. There is no mention of a spouse at the time of his death.
Western roles.

He is best known for the extremely challenging game of one-pocket, which Cook described as "the pool game for and creative abilities." He was nicknamed "Cookie Monster", and due to his unassuming appearance hiding world-class talent, "the Clark Kent of one-pocket". Cook was inducted into the One Pocket Hall of Fame in 2005. Multiple world championship winner Allen Hopkins said of Cook that he "was probably the best player in the world from 1976 until the mid-".
Early life.
As a child, born in Lima, Ohio, Cook suffered debilitating bone deterioration in his right hip, from ages 5 to 10, preventing him from playing running sports, and leading to a focus on hand–eye coordination games. By his teens, Cook was a local champion at table tennis and golf (also winning the National Putter Tournament at 15), as well an accomplished bowler. He did not begin playing pool until age 14, but soon focused all of his sporting attention on the game. By 19, Cook had attracted a pro, Danny Jones, to play him in an exhibition match, and went on to place 23rd at his first Stardust Open tournament at the titular casino in Las Vegas, Nevada..
He subsequently managed a pool hall in Springfield, Ohio, and in 1968 moved to Tampa, Florida where he ran Dale Mabry Billiards with is friend and one-pocket mentor "Lefty" Goff for several years.
Professional career.
in that era the premier one-pocket event. He was both One-pocket and All-around Champion at the 1970 Stardust event, at age 23. He competed in other events throughout the 1970s, including the US Open.
After many years of victories in only small events, Cook took the 1991 Legends of One Pocket Philadelphia championship (and was runner-up in that year's earlier Legends event in Las Vegas), and later went on to win the 1993 Los Angeles Open. The 1991 victory made him one of only two players to ever win both the Stardust and Legends one-pocket titles.
Aside from competing professionally, Cook served as the manager and house pro at Varsity Billiard Room in Tampa from the early 1970s to 1996, In this capacity, Steve did as much as he could to promote the game of pocket billiards. An example was that here he was, a world champion one-pocket player, and he would give one-pocket lessons at Varsity Billiards for $10.00 per hour. Most other professional players would charge $1000.00 a session for lessons. Steve really did what he could to help anyone improve their game.
Cook was also one of a number of contributing authors to the one-pocket book "Shots, Moves and Strategies: As Taught by the Game's Greatest Players" (edited by Eddie Robin), now a highly sought-after collector's item.

Later life.
In 1996, Cook returned to Lima, Ohio, to care for his mother after she suffered a stroke. He continued playing in the Midwest, and occasionally in major events in Las Vegas and elsewhere.
At the age of 56 he died in his sleep on October 21, 2003 in his hometown of Lima, of causes that were not disclosed in his obituary.

Hudson Mohawke

Hudson Mohawke (born Ross Birchard, 11 February 1986) is a Scottish electronic music producer/DJ from Glasgow, Scotland, affiliated with the LuckyMe collective. He is signed to Warp Records and Kanye West's label, GOOD Music. He released his debut album on Warp, called "Butter" in October 2009. Mohawke makes up one half of the popular trap music duo TNGHT.
Biography.
At the age of 15, Birchard (under the name DJ Itchy) was the youngest ever UK DMC finalist. His earliest gigs as a club DJ were with Glasgow University's Subcity Radio where he first appeared as part of the culture city kids show and later as part of other shows including Turntable Science with Pro Vinylist Karim and Cloudo's Happy Hardcore show, under the alias DJ Mayhem. Birchard became "Hudson Mohawke" after seeing the name engraved on a statue in the hallway of his accommodation.
In 2009, Hudson Mohawke signed to Warp Records, despite a very limited track record of official releases; in fact, the bulk of his releases were unofficial tracks and DJ mixes circulated on the Internet. His first official release to get major notice was entitled "Spotted" on the Rush Hour beat compilation Beat Dimensions Vol 1, which then lead to a release entitled "Free Mo", a track on the Ubiquity Records various-artists compilation "Choices, Vol. 1" (2007); subsequently, he was featured as a remixer on "Choices, Vol. 2" (2007). In 2008 his 12" EP "Ooops!" on LuckyMe/Wireblock became an underground sensation, particularly once word spread of his recording contract with Warp.
In 2009 he contributed a cover of a Jimi Tenor song to the "Warp20 (Recreated)" compilation.
In 2012, the Scottish producer began a series of collaborations with Kanye West, resulting in production credits on the highly anticipated GOOD Music label album "Cruel Summer". On January 17, 2013, it was announced that Mohawke had officially signed with GOOD Music as a producer, whilst remaining with Warp and LuckyMe as a recording artist.
Style.
Following early acclaim for his turntable work, he has gone on to receive praise for his "genre-smashing" approach, in which styles of music are "incorporated, manipulated and bounced against each other."
Other work.
In addition to his solo work, Hudson Mohawke collaborated with Mike Slott as Heralds of Change, releasing a series of 12" EPs including "Show You" (2006), "Sittin' on the Side" (2007), "Puzzles" (2007) and "Secrets" (2007) on All City Records. Hudson Mo was also DJ/Producer for the now defunct hip hop group Surface Emp alongside MC's Dom Sum and sometimes 2 Can Dan. Surface Empire released the "LuckyMe" EP in 2005 on Far Cut Records. He produced the debut EP for Manchester band Egyptian Hip Hop at Club Ralph Studios in London, which was released in August 2010. One of his tracks titled '100hm' has been featured as a track on Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V.
Hudson Mohawke has also collaborated with contemporary artist Lunice to form the collaborative TNGHT.

The Great Escape (Irish TV series)

The Great Escape is an Irish television series broadcast on RTÉ One each Tuesday night at 22:15. It follows Irish families who leave Ireland to travel across the world in search of a better life. Two series have thus far been produced, with each series documenting four families who leave Ireland in search of a better life. The series details how they cope in their new surroundings, without any support from friends or family as they set up businesses, develop new careers, meet new friends and overcome cultural differences. Produced by Coco Television, it has thus far featured Irish families who have relocated to such countries as France, South Africa, Spain (thrice), Australia, Austria and Italy. The second series in 2009 was part of a group of programmes dealing with the topic of emigration. Others included "J1 - Summer in the Sun", "Death or Canada", "Blood of the Irish" and "Who Do You Think You Are?".
Series one.
Series one was filmed in 2005 – 2006.
Episode one.
The Casserley family are Ger, Eimer and their three children, 14-year-old Eoin, 12-year-old Niamh and 10-year-old Ciara. Despite being unable to speak the French language, they moved to Bordeaux, France in 2004. Ger was laid off and, having always dreamed of setting up a Pitch'n Putt style golf course in France, decided then was the best opportunity. They sold their home in Swords, County Dublin. After some travelling they settled near Montpon, a town located about forty minutes from Bordeaux. Their three-bedroom home cost €104,000 and Ger, along with his brother in law, purchased a strip of land nearby in order to develop his golf course. The episode follows the children's struggles with the French language and their father's difficulties in obtaining planning permission for his golf course.
Episode two.
Colin and Teresa Pielow are from Dublin but relocated to South Africa in October 2005 where they set up a small vineyard and opened their own business, Pielows Restaurant. This change came about after the couple holidayed in Tulbagh, a place located one hour and twenty minutes north of Cape Town which they loved very much. They sold the restaurant they owned in Cobh (Robin Hill), rented their Enniskerry cottage and left for South Africa with their two labrador retrievers. The Pielows purchased a traditional cape Dutch style house with 1.5 hectares for €220,000 down the street from their new restaurant, part of the well-established guesthouse "De Oude Herberg". They planned to cultivate the land as a vineyard. The Pielows are both trained chefs and have owned and successfully run restaurants and a wine business in the past. This episode details their experiences in the different culture as they manage their restaurant, cultivate their vineyard and produce their own wine.
Episode three.
The Doyles are Mark, his wife Sonia and their two daughters, 13-year-old Rebecca and 3-year-old Ambar are originally from Bray, County Wicklow. In 2005 they moved to the town of Guadalajara, near Madrid in Spain. Sonia is originally from Guadalajara, but was studying English in Bray when she met Mark sixteen years previously. Mark helped run a pub called "Jim Doyles" located on Bray's seafront. After fourteen years together in Bray Mark and Sonia decided to move to Sonia's home town, with Sonia moving first with her daughters to settle them into school life, whilst Mark remained for a time in Bray to overlook the sale of the family home and his share of the business. Sonia's family still live in Guadalajara and the Doyles initially stay with Sonia's parents. By December 2005 Mark is full-time in Spain and the family has moved into a new home.
Episode four.
The Whittakers are Pam and Russell from Knocklyon in Dublin. They witnessed a significant rise in value in their three-bedroom semi-detached home. Pam is a trained hairdresser who managed a local salon, whilst Russell worked as a panel beater in a garage. They have two children, twelve-year-old Ryan and two-year-old Charlotte. A couple of years previously they holidayed in Australia for three months, visiting Pam's only sister, who had already been living there for a number of years. When they returned to Ireland they decided to move to Australia and applied for visas. After two years of red tape, they left Ireland on Saint Patrick's Day in 2006. The Whittakers settled in Ipswich in Queensland forty minutes from Brisbane, where Pam's parents have since retired. Within weeks of arriving Pam and Russell buy a large detached house on stilts by a river with a large garden and Russell obtains a job in a local garage. Pam settles Ryan into a suitable school and spends time with Charlotte, something she was unable to do in Ireland as she was a working mother.
Series two.
Series two was broadcast from 13 January – 3 February 2009.
Episode one.
The Dankers are stay-at-home mother Suzanne, former antiques dealer Howard and their two young sons from Terenure in Dublin. They moved to Marbella, Spain in July 2007. Suzanne set up a wedding planning business for Irish couples hoping to marry in Spain, whilst Howard hoped to set up his own antiques business. The episode follows their first year in Spain.
Episode two.
Barbara Owens from Knocklyon, Dublin and Welshman Lee Darch are a couple with two young daughters and Barbara has a 17-year-old son, Marti. They managed to sell their Knocklyon home in July 2008 just before the property bubble burst in order to fund their move to Dénia, Spain. Lee is a builder by trade but plans to set up a fishing business in Spain.
Episode three.
Adrian and Michelle Barry from Kildare and Cork have been married for two years and left behind a daily commute from Kildare to Dublin and two well-paid jobs in finance and IT to move to Austria in July 2007 where they set up a ski chalet business.
Episode four.
Tarja Owens and Niall Davis from Bray and Dublin moved to Northern Italy for a six-month trial due to their belief that it would have better mountain cycling training resources. They intend to set up a mountain biking tour business. As professional athletes they do not earn very much and they have short careers. Tarja is helped in her endeavours by local hotel owner Merco but Niall's focus is on training which presents difficulties for Tarja.
Reaction.
John Boland of the "Irish Independent" referred to the Dankers of series two's opening episode as a "charmless couple" he was willing to "hurriedly bypass" in his argument that the BBC had entertained him more than RTÉ.

Grassroots (organization)

Grassroots is a political organization in Erie County, New York, which was founded in 1986 by a group of block club leaders, that is known for successful voter registration and elective placements such as Byron Brown in the Buffalo Common Council and Crystal Peoples in the Erie County Legislature. During its founding, organizers had gotten a map of Buffalo, New York's 437 election districts and found 29 candidates to obtain petition signatures to run for district committee slots. They won 16 positions. 
They originally organized to seek attention for their neighborhood problems, but have grown into a larger cause. Statewide leaders such as United States Senator Charles Schumer speak glowingly of the group. Schumer once described it as "...one of the smartest, savviest political groups in the United States." Eliot Spitzer said, "I think that a candidate running in Buffalo or for statewide office would be remiss not to sit down with the leadership of Grassroots."
Brown eventually served as a vice president of the organization. By the mid-1990s, two Grassroots members were part of the City Council and Peoples had nearly defeated Arthur Eve, the longest-serving member of the New York State Assembly. Brown's New York State Senate victory confirmed the organization's appeal outside of Erie County. By 2003, its members included three Buffalo City Councilmen, a New York State Senator, and a New York State Assemblywoman. The organization is a largely African-American group dominated by younger activists founded to challenge State Assemblyman Arthur Eve's control over State funding to the Buffalo area.

The Lithgow Plot

The Lithgow Plot was an assassination attempt of Queen Elizabeth II on 29 April 1970 at Lithgow, New South Wales, Australia in the Blue Mountains while she was on a state visit. The Queen and her husband were on a train trip from Sydney to Orange.
The plan.
The would-be assassins rolled a large wooden log onto the tracks when in was dark and wedged it into place. It was meant to de-rail the train and if it did it would have smashed into an embankment. It failed, because at the time the train was travelling unusually slowly - when it struck the blockage, it still slid for 700 metres before coming to a stop.
A train had been through an hour before the Queen's train to check the line but at that time it was clear. It seems as if the people behind the attack knew the schedule of Her Majesty.
Unaware.
Up to now the Royal Couple were unaware of the attempt to kill her because the Australian Federal Government told the local police to keep quiet about the incident. This hampered the investigation attempt because people interviewed either couldn't or wouldn't speak about what had happened.
Speaking Out.
The whole event has come to light now thanks to the retired Detective Superintendent Cliff McHardy (who currently resides in Glenbrook). He told The "Lithgow Mercury" - a local newspaper - and "The Daily Mail", a British newspaper, about the attempt late in January 2009.
Buckingham Palace declined comment on the issue but has said that diary of the trip has shown no record of the train hitting a log.

Village Barn

Village Barn was the first country music program on American network television. Broadcast by NBC-TV from May 24, 1948–September 1949 and from January 16–May 29, 1950, the live weekly variety series originated from The Village Barn, a country music nightclub in New York City's Greenwich Village.
Hosts included Zebe Carver, Dick Thomas, Dick Dutley, Bob Stanton (Robert Haymes), Rosalie Allen and Ray Forrest. Guests for the premiere, a 40-minute broadcast by WNBT-TV, were Texas Ruby and Curly Fox along with The Dixie Boys.
Performers included Pappy Howard and His Tumbleweed Gang, Harry Ranch and His Kernels of Korn, Bill Long's Ranch Girls, Plute Pete (1948–1949) and Romolo De Spirito (1949). Shorty Warren and His Western Rangers appeared in November 1948. In July 1949, Oklahoma governor Roy J. Turner appeared, singing his single, "My Memory Trail".
The show also featured square dancing and audience participation in kiddie car, hobby horse and potato sack races.
The Village Barn nightclub.
The Village Barn nightclub, in the basement of Electric Lady Studios in New York City, was opened in November 1930 by owner Meyer Horowitz, who resigned as president and director on October 19, 1951. He was succeeded by his brother, Lawrence (Horowitz) Horton, who subsequently left to pursue other interests. Ownership remained with family members, including Horton, who returned to active management in the early 1960s; a nephew, George Goodman; and son Michael. Meyer Horowitz remained active as a consultant until the Barn closed in August 1967.
In 1931, Rudy Vallée, who had a nearby club, Villa Vallée, discovered Judy Canova at the Barn. Don Cornell, the Hartmans and other stars also got their start at the club.

The album release was supported by two national headline tours alongside Oxygen Thief, and a support slot with Frank Turner in May 2011. All undistributed copies of the album were subsequently destroyed in the arson attack on the Sony DADC warehouse during the 2011 England Riots in August 2011.
After unreleased material featured on a couple of compilation appearances towards the end of 2011, BBC News reported that Marwood was working on a second album. It was confirmed in a blog post on 23 December 2012 that the new album would follow in 2013 and was preceded by a five-song EP featuring re-recorded live takes of previous songs entitled "Incidents/Accidents", released via Bandcamp on a pay-what-you-like basis.
Following the Bandcamp release, two further digital EPs were released in February 2013 through Josaka Music, "Demons" and "Ben Marwood & Quiet Quiet Band Lay Low", a split with Reading band Quiet Quiet Band which had shortened to "Lay Low" by the time it reached retailers, after which Rock Sound announced that the new album "Back Down" would be released on May 13, 2013 through Xtra Mile Recordings. A headline UK tour was subsequently announced which also featured prominent members of the underground UK acoustic scene, as well as a video for the single "Under Lock and Key", before heading to the US as opening support for Frank Turner.
Outside of performing, Marwood also hosts a monthly show on a weekly alternative podcast edit radio and has had appearances from people such as his childhood friend Mimi Halfpenny and his mother.

Simultaneum

A shared church, or Simultankirche, Simultaneum or, more fully, simultaneum mixtum, a term first coined in 16th-century Germany, is a church in which public worship is conducted by adherents of two or more religious groups. Such churches became common in the German-speaking lands of Europe in the wake of the Protestant Reformation. The different Christian denominations (such as Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, or United, etc.), share the same church building, although they worship at different times and with different clergy. It is thus a form of religious toleration. 
"Simultaneum" as a policy was particularly attractive to rulers who ruled over populations which contained considerable numbers of both Catholics and Protestants. It was often the opposite of "cuius regio, eius religio" and used in situations where a ruler was of a different religion than the majority of the people, and not strong enough to impose his religion on the population.

Borneo thrush

The Borneo Thrush ("Turdus poliocephalus seebohmi"), also known as the Mountain Blackbird or locally in Dusun as Luhui tana, is a bird in the Thrush family. It is a subspecies of the Island Thrush ("Turdus poliocephalus") endemic to the island of Borneo.
Description.
The Borneo Thrush is mainly dark brown in colour. The flanks, lower breast and belly are rufous, with a white vent. It is about 23 cm in length. Its bill, eye-ring and legs are deep yellow. Males and females are similar in size and appearance.
Distribution and habitat.
The subspecies is found only on the higher levels of Mount Kinabalu (4095 m), normally from about 2100 m asl upwards to the limits of vegetation, as well as around the summits of Mount Trus Madi (2642 m) and Mount Tambuyukon (2579 m), all of which lie in the state of Sabah, Malaysia. The habitat ranges from cold, wet and mossy montane forest up to, on Kinabalu, almost bare rock at about 3200 m asl.
Behaviour.
Breeding.
The nest is described as being a substantial structure, made of woven plant material and lined with grass, 15 cm across by 10 cm deep. It is built a few metres above the ground in a fork or the branches of the low trees found at the altitude at which it lives. The normal clutch is a single egg. Nests with eggs or chicks have been recorded in February and March, suggesting a restricted breeding season.
Feeding.
The birds forage through the forest in the trees and on the ground. The diet is largely vegetarian, mainly fruit and berries, though insects are also taken.
Voice.
A loud melodious song and rattling alarm calls have been recorded.

The 2nd constituency of New Caledonia is a French legislative constituency in New Caledonia.
The second constituency was created in a redistricting in 1978. Between 1978 and a new redistricting in 1986, the second constituency represented the ethnically diverse western shore of the main island, but its main population centre was Nouméa, a largely French-populated loyalist stronghold. Since 1986, the constituency is composed of the so-called "brousse" - that is, the rural parts of the main island which are mostly Kanak but also the more populous French-populated suburbs of Nouméa.

Since 1986, the constituency is composed of the Caldoche-populated loyalist stronghold of Nouméa and the strongly nationalist Kanak-populated Loyalty Islands. Due to this makeup in which loyalist-voting Nouméa far outnumbers the sparsely populated islands, the constituency is strongly loyalist.

List of Septimus Heap characters

This article catalogs the key characters from the books in the Septimus Heap series by Angie Sage. These include the books "Magyk", "Flyte", "Physik", "Queste", "Syren", "Darke", and Fyre. Some characters play a central role in all the books, while others are only central to the plot in one or two of the books. When reviewing the first book in the series, Magyk, Sabina Qazi of Dawn.com described the characters as follows:These characters remind us of the different types of people around us. Sage separates the qualities that make us who we are and typecasts them into these roles. The good and the bad characteristics are accompanied by the dull and the intelligent, the silly with the mature and the unapproachable with the loving. But this doesn’t mean that her characters are not well-rounded people. They are, but by highlighting certain aspects of their personality, she makes it easy for the reader to think of real people in terms of these characters. Thus an evil principal becomes the necromancer, the dead queen loved grandparent, Septimus as the most intelligent but quiet boy in class and Jenna, perhaps, as the new best friend in the neighbourhood" - "Dawn.com"
The Heaps.
The Heaps are the main characters in the series. Although the story revolves mainly around the protagonist Septimus and his sister Jenna, the whole family comes together in the adventures. They are a heap of Heaps.
Silas and Sarah Heap.
Silas is the father of the Heap household. He is an Ordinary Wizard with wizard green eyes, curly hair and wears the traditional blue cloak of Ordinary Wizards. Silas was apprenticed to former ExtraOrdinary Wizard Alther Mella but left his apprenticeship, thus losing the title to Marcia Overstrand. He loves his family and is on terms with everybody except with Marcia. Silas loves to play Counter Feet with the gate-keeper of the Castle, Gringe. His addiction to the game makes him forget more important things like his family. He was responsible for accidentally releasing the spirit of Queen Etheldredda in "Physik".
Sarah is the mother of the Heap household. She has the witch-like blue eyes and fair curly hair of the Heap family. She studied with the Physik woman, Galen, about magical herbs and plants and it was there that Silas Heap met her while getting lost in the forest one day. Sarah, though she is loving and caring in nature, is somewhat forgetful and sometimes more concerned about other things rather than the well-being of her near ones. Sarah has learned "Physik" and can also do some magic. Like Silas she is on good terms generally with everybody, except Marcia.
Critics were surprised by Sage's portrayal of Silas and Sarah as they show least concern for the welfare of their children. The critics have written about situations where the characters' lack of affection is more pronounced:- like when Jenna was kidnapped and they are convinced that Simon cannot kidnap her or when Septimus is sent back in time.
Simon Heap.
Simon Heap is the oldest Heap son. He wanted to be Marcia's apprentice but lost to Septimus. He betrayed his family in the second book "Flyte" by joining the evil necromancer DomDaniel and made a bargain with the dead necromancer—to restore him to life, if he's taken on as the next Apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard. He kidnapped Jenna and tried to kill Marcia by a "Placement" on her but was thwarted by Septimus and the others. He later learnt his mistakes and reformed his ways. Simon is romantically involved with Lucy Gringe, gatekeeper Gringe's daughter. Together at present they stay in an apartment in the Port. According to "Fantasy Literature" review, he's like the typical bad-guy who makes the mistake of not killing his enemies straight-away. Simon moved to the Darke side and even tried to kill his siblings Septimus and Jenna. However, note that Simon knew that Jenna was not his real sister and thought Septimus was only pretending to be his little brother so he might not have behaved in the same manner to Nicko, Erik, Edd, Jo-Jo, and Sam, all of whom he saw as real brothers. He has since changed his ways, becoming good and has tried to return to the castle.
Sam, Jo-Jo, Edd & Erik Heap.
Sam, Edd and Erik (twins) and Jo-Jo are the second, third, fourth and fifth Heap sons, respectively. They all started living in the forest after Sarah took them there for refuge at Galen's place. Wendron Witches visit them quite a lot. Generally they are quite aloof from the happenings of the outside world and have adapted to the ways and life of the Forest. Sam loves fishing and used to go with Silas for catching fish. He was the one who showed Septimus and the others the actual path to the "House of Foryx". Jo-Jo has a crush on Marissa, a Wendron Witch. Edd and Erik are twins and love to joke around.
Nicko Heap.
The sixth son of the Heap family. He has a medium-build figure, with the characteristic green eyes and curly straw-colored hair of the Heap family, and has a happy and helpful disposition. As a son of a wizard, Nicko has learned magic but is not very interested in it. He is more interested in boats and sailing, a passion which brought him and Snorri Snorrelssen closer. He is apprenticed to Jannit Marten, who owns the boatyard of the Castle. Nicko loves his brother Septimus and adoptive sister Jenna dearly, and helps them in every possible way. He became romantically involved with Snorri, whom he met during events from "Physik" and was lost with her in time in "Queste". He returned to the Castle during the events of "Syren" and was one of the main sailor of Milo Banda's ship "The Cerys". In Darke, he helped get Septimus to the Darke Halls. Snorri also left the castle during "Darke" to return home with her mother. Although Nicko enjoyed her company, he felt 'free' after she left.
Septimus Heap.
The eponymous protagonist of the series, Septimus spent the first ten years of his life in the Young Army as Boy 412 after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. As the seventh son of a seventh son, aptly named Septimus, he has exceptional magical powers and is currently apprenticed to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand, who he trusts more than anyone else. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister.
Jenna Heap.
Adopted by the Heap family as a baby in place of Septimus, Jenna is actually the daughter of the assassinated queen, and thus a princess. She is a small girl, with deep violet eyes, fair complexion and wears a deep red cloak with the gold circlet of the princess on her head. Although loving and caring at heart, she can sometimes be very stubborn. She loves her family dearly and would do anything for them. For a long time, she was unsure and unhappy at the thought of being future Queen, but she has come to accept her heritage and future.
Zelda Zanuba Heap.
Zelda Heap is actually Silas' aunt but is known as Aunt Zelda to all and greatly loved for her happy-go-lucky nature, although she and Marcia are known to have disputes regarding usage of magic without disrespecting Mother Nature. As the current Keeper of the Dragon Boat, she resides in a cottage on Draggen Island in the Marram Marshes. She is of medium-build, often wears a tent-like dress (which gives her a dumpy appearance), and has a shock of flyaway grey hair, a wrinkled smiling face, and the bright blue eyes of a White Witch. Apparently, she has absolutely no sense of taste and cooks dishes mainly consisting of cabbages and eel. The only other person who appreciates her cooking is Septimus. She has a pet cat called Bert which she transformed into a duck (they're easier to keep in the Marram Marshes) and also is friends with a marsh creature named Boggart. Zelda is the one who revealed the true identity of Boy 412 as Septimus Heap. She is generally very helpful. This is reflected many times in the series; like the time she helps Jenna when the Dragon Boat is badly damaged by Simon's "thunderflash" or reviving Merrin Meredith from being consumed and dying. Zelda did not appear in the fourth book "Queste". In "Syren" Zelda sends Wolf-Boy for an errand to The Port Witch Coven, the success of which will entitle him to be a Keeper. In "Fyre", she begins to become forgetful and later reveals that she has lost one of the bowls that are used to save the Dragon Boat as the Marsh Python ate it. She then leaves Wolf Boy to be the Keeper as she realises that she is too old and it is her time to die, and goes to visit with her brothers Benjamin and Theo Heap in the Forest as her final resting place.
Benjamin and Theo Heap.
Benjamin and Theo are the grandfathers of the Heap household. Benjamin Heap is the father of Silas. He is a shape shifter. When he got old, he decided to permanently assume tree-form instead of becoming a ghost. Silas kept searching for his father in the forest for a long time, until when, the Wendron Witch mother, Morwenna Mould shows him his father's location. Septimus and Nicko met their "Grandpa Benji" while they were in the forest searching for Jenna in "Flyte". Benjamin saved them from a pack of Wolverines and they got to know him.
Theo Heap is the second brother to Benjamin and Zelda. Like his elder brother, he is also a shape-shifter and shifted to be a Storm Petrel. On stormy nights in the Marram Marshes, Zelda keeps a lookout for any Storm Petrels which might be blown away to the marshes and hopes to meet her brother again one day. In "Magyk" there is an instance when Theo is blown in by a storm and sits on the cottage's roof seeing Zelda see boy 412's identity in the pond.
Other important characters.
The following are the other important characters in the series who have played a major part in the story.
Marcia Overstrand.
The current ExtraOrdinary Wizard. Ambitious and willful, Marcia is a very powerful wizard. Although she seems stern, bad-tempered and often intimidating, there are a number of instances when she shows she truly has a good heart. She loves her apprentice Septimus dearly and feels great responsibility to protect both him and his sister, perhaps with her life. She also has arguments occasionally with Silas Heap and Jillie Djinn, neither of whom she gets on well with. She is a tall woman, with long, dark curly hair and deep-green eyes, and generally wears a deep purple tunic with her trademark purple python-skin boots. Her symbol and source of power, an Akhu-Amulet, hangs around her neck.
Alther Mella.
Ex-ExtraOrdinary Wizard, before Marcia. He used to be Marcia's tutor before he was murdered in a conspiracy hatched by DomDaniel to take over the Castle. He is present in the world as a ghost and helps Septimus and the others on their adventures. Described to be wearing the purple cloak of the ExtraOrdinary wizard, he has his white shining hair styled as a ponytail at his back and wears big brown boots. In the middle of his ghostly chest he still has an impression of blood indicating the place where a bullet hit him and he died. Alther, being a ghost, can only go to places he has once visited in his lifetime. If he tries to visit some other place, he is Returned, thrown backwards off his feet by an invisible force, which he hates. But still, he can sometimes cause things to be moved about like he did to annoy DomDaniel in "Magyk". Being an ex-ExtraOrdinary Wizard he was automatically summoned in the Gathering In "Queste". Alther has always shared romantic feelings for Alice Nettles, former Chief Customs Officer, and stays with her ghost in front of the Palace.
Snorri Snorrelssen.
Snorri is an independent and somewhat mysterious young Northern Trader, who comes to the Castle to trade her goods and to find her father. Born to Olaf and Alfrun Snorrelssen, Snorri is a pale complexioned girl with white blonde hair and pale blue eyes with an air of mystery around them. She helps the Heap family, and is especially friends with Nicko, with whom she shares a love of sailing and who she has romantic feelings for. As a Spirit Seer, she can see all spirits, even if they have not chosen to reveal themselves to others. She has an orange pet cat named Ullr who turns into a deadly Black panther at night. Snorri helped to prevent Etheldredda's spirit from murdering Jenna, by summoning her father's spirit who stopped Etheldredda from pushing Jenna into the fire conjured by Marcia. In a review by Katie Dickinson of "Waterstones.com", she said that the character was interesting and she hoped that Snorri and her mysterious cat would stay on in the series.Snorri, however, leaves the castle at the end of "Darke" to return home with her mother.
DomDaniel.
A Necromancer and ex-ExtraOrdinary Wizard, he is the main antagonist of the first novel. His main purpose is to regain control of the Wizard Tower from Marcia and tries a number of times to do so. DomDaniel is described as a tall man wearing the black robes of dark magic. On his head is a tall cylindrical black hat which denotes him as a necromancer. DomDaniel is generally described as a conniving, power-hungry and cunning man. He once consumed his apprentice's body so that he can trick Marcia into giving him her Akhu-Amulet. Marcia banished him but he tried to take revenge through Simon's help in "Flyte". Marcia was able to "Identify" him again properly and he was completely finished though his ghost endured. But ultimately he vanished into apparent non-existence after his bones were consumed by Spit Fyre. Before he dies he is an amazing villain with good ambition and power.
Beetle.
Actual name O. Beetle Beetle, he is Septimus' best friend from the Manuscriptorium. Introduced in "Flyte", Beetle has become a regular character in the series. He assists Septimus on their adventures, and has some of them of his own accord. Beetle is the General Dogsbody and Inspection Clerk in the Magykal Manuscriptorium and Spell Checkers Incorporated and is well loved by all. He also inspects the ice-tunnels under the Manuscriptorium on his sled. Beetle is generally in awe of Marcia but internally has developed a crush on Jenna. He is bitten by the aie-aie and affected by the plague which spread in the Castle in "Physik" but recovered from it by the medicine brewed by Septimus. After he was fired from the Manuscriptorium by chief scribe Jillie Djinn for discussing Manusciptorium business in front of Jenna and for saying unflattering things about Jillie Djinn, Beetle joined Septimus and Jenna to bring back Nicko and Snorri from the House of Foryx. In Darke, Bettle is named Chief Hermetic Scribe after the death of Jillie Djinn.
Beetle got his name from his mother, Pamela Beetle, after his father, Brian Beetle, died from a spiderbite. His mother, who simply called Brian "Beetle", was forced to impromptu name her child, and all she could do was wail: "Oh, Beetle... Beetle!" Duly, the toddler's name became O. Beetle Beetle. In "Syren" Beetle assists Septimus and Jenna, while being stranded on the Syren islands, to take care of Spit Fyre and to save the Castle from the impending dangers. In Darke, Beetle is trapped in the Manuscriptorium during The Great Undoing and later is picked to become Chief Hermetic Scribe. He is quite mature for his age and is the youngest person to pass the Manuscriptorium entrance exam. He is also very intelligent. He is about three years older than his best friend Septimus. They share a love of FizzFroot and a hatred of Darke magic. Beetle always wears his Admiral's jacket given to him by Milo Banda in Syren. Beetle is described as stocky and has a shock of black hair. He loves going through the Manuscriptorium Ice Tunnels.
Merrin Meredith.
Introduced in "Magyk", Merrin Meredith is a boy who was mistaken for Septimus and was apprenticed to DomDaniel. When a matron midwife stole Septimus at birth from Sarah Heap to give to DomDaniel, circumstance had it that her own son, Merrin, was taken away by DomDaniel and the real Septimus ended up in the Young Army. After his apprenticeship, Merrin is continuously looked down by DomDaniel who always expects him to do brilliant magic (thinking him to be Septimus), which he fails to do. As a whole, Merrin is an unhappy, nasty boy. He was once Consumed by DomDaniel and almost died but was Revived by Zelda. After DomDaniel is destroyed he became Simon's apprentice but ran away from the Badlands to take revenge on Septimus. He took a job in the Manuscriptorium and joined hands with a ghost, Tertius Fume, to send Septimus on a deadly "Queste". He is the main villain in Darke and wears the Two-Faced ring only to have his thumb chopped off and him reunited with his mother.
Stanley (Rat 101).
Stanley is an ex-Secret Service Message rat. His association with the Heaps began in "Magyk" when he was sent by Sarah to give a message to Silas in the Marshes. From then onwards circumstance had it that Stanley became involved in the adventures of Septimus and his friends. This led to his separation from his wife Dawnie, who went to live with her sister. At present, Stanley is working to set up the Secret Service Message agency again by taking Jenna's permission. Stanley adopted 4 baby ratlets he found on the long walk and claims that he will love them 100 times more than he will ever love Dawnie. Jenna returned from the island of the Syren with rats available for employment. The rats were aboard the "Cerys." 
Queen Etheldredda.
The Substantial Spirit of an ancient queen with a history of filicide, Etheldredda wreaks havoc on the Castle when her spirit is accidentally released by Silas in "Physik". Etheldredda, being an ancient queen is described having the typical dressing sense and looks of a somewhat "Renessaince" period. Etheldredda was a tyrannical ruler during her rule. Having already murdered her two unnamed twin daughters, she was on the verge of killing her daughter Esmeralda, who was the successor to the throne, when she was thwarted by Septimus and the others back in time in "Physik". After getting released, Etheldredda makes a plan to kill Jenna and reclaim her throne again. Marcia defeats her and destroys her forever with help from Snorri Snorrlesson and her father Olaf. Katie Dickinson of "Waterstones" was impressed by the character and said that "Queen Etheldredda leaves you shivering". Rebecca of "Fantasy Literature" said that Etheldredda is quite an unnerving villain. She is described to be "As strict and severe as the worst storybook governess and ultimately quite as evil as any fairytale stepmother".
Marcellus Pye.
Etheldredda's son, Marcellus is a renowned Alchemist, who has drunk the potion of immortality. He is over five hundred years old and lives in the Castle near Snake Slipway. When Septimus was sent back in time in "Physik" by Etheldredda, he became Marcellus' apprentice. While coming back to their own time, Septimus promised Marcellus to prepare a youth potion so that the present Marcellus regains his youth which he did. He seems to dislike having to interact with the outside world, as he understands so little of the modern time and prefers staying at home, though he is on good terms with Septimus and Jenna, who resembles his long gone sister Esmeralda. Critics found his character to be "not the quite good guy, yet not the quite bad guy either.
Wolf Boy (Boy 409).
Better known as Boy 409, he is a friend of Septimus from the Young Army who got almost drowned one night in an expedition to the Forest, and was left for dead. He was later adopted by wolverines, and left when he got too big. Septimus later met him in his brother's camps in the Forest, where he had been found and re-christened as "Wolf Boy". He attempted to help Jenna find Septimus in Physik. He is currently apprenticed to Aunt Zelda and is in the process of becoming the first male Keeper. In Syren, he takes the test to become Keeper. At the Port Witch Coven, he discovers that he must feed Lucy Gringe to the Grim. The two manage to escape, but get tangled with some nefarious sailors. He gets along well with Lucy, except that he doesn't like her screaming. Later, when they meet Septimus, Jenna, and Beetle, he is wary at first. However, he becomes friends with Beetle. Aunt Zelda has grown extremely fond of him and is relieved to see him safe and sound at the end of Syren. In Darke, it is found out that his name is actually Mandy Marwick and he has two other brothers, Matt and Marcus.
Lucy Gringe.
Lucy Gringe is Simon Heap's love interest. In Magyk the pair tried to marry, but the wedding was put off when Simon was dragged away by guards. She refused to believe that Simon had turned evil, and in Physik she set off to find him in the Badlands. It was revealed that they found each other, and the pair looked after Merrin for a short spell before he ran away. In Syren, she was captured by the port witch coven but escaped along with Wolf-Boy, only to run into more trouble on The Marauder. She storms The Cerys along with Jenna, Septimus, and Wolf-boy when it became overrun with Skipper Fry and The Crowe Twins, and also saves Miarr's life. In Darke it is announced that Lucy and Simon will marry. Lucy is described as a pretty girl with large brown eyes and brown hair in plaits, which she ties with colored ribbons. She is quite bossy and stubborn, but she is very determined and loyal, and had a warm heart underneath her blunt exterior.

Cyathus olla

Cyathus olla is a species of saprobic fungus in the genus "Cyathus", family Nidulariaceae. The fruit bodies resemble tiny bird's nests filled with "eggs" – spore-containing structures called peridioles. Like other bird's nest fungi, "C. olla" relies on the force of falling water to dislodge peridioles from fruiting bodies to eject and disperse their spores. The life cycle of this fungus allows it to reproduce both sexually, with meiosis, and asexually via spores. "C. olla" is a relatively common fungus, with a worldwide distribution. It is the subject of agricultural research to determine its potential as a means to accelerate the breakdown of crop residue, and reduce the population of plant pathogens. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word "olla", meaning "pot".
Description.
"Cyathus olla" bears a resemblance to a miniature bird's nest containing eggs, hence the common name bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or "peridium", is roughly funnel-shaped, 10–18 mm tall and 8–12 mm wide. It is greyish yellow or greyish brown to fawn-colored and covered with even, fine-textured hairs on the outside surface. The inner surface is silver grey and smooth, often with faint transverse ridges. "Cyathus olla" is thick-walled, and flared outwards at the rim; the rim is typically wavy in outline. The 'eggs', or peridioles, typically number 8 to 10 in the cup, and they are white or grey in color, with a diameter of 2–4 mm—conspicuously larger than other "Cyathus" species. They are covered with a thin membrane called a "tunica".
Peridioles are often attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. Inside the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. "C. olla" has a wide purse with an upper portion not easily distinguishable from the lower part.
A different form of this species, "Cyathus olla" forma "anglicus", originally reported from England by mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, has also been found in Oregon and Colorado in the USA, Alberta Canada, and in Argentina. This form is large, with cup openings up to 1.5 cm (0.6 in) in diameter. Spores have dimensions of 11.5–12.5 × 7.5–9 µm.
The related species "Cyathus earlei" Lloyd closely resembles "C. olla", although mating analysis has shown that they are distinct species.
Microscopic features.
"Cyathus olla" has ovate-shaped spores with dimensions of 10–14 × 6–8 µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of various members of the Nidulariaceae family, including "Cyathus olla". He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two to four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary "apiculus" marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.
Habitat and distribution.
Being a saprobic fungus, "Cyathus olla" obtains nutrients from the breakdown of dead organic matter, and as such is usually found growing on woody debris; specimens found growing on soil are usually attached to bits of wood or stems present in the soil. Brodie notes that this species usually grows in moist and shaded locations, although its discovery in the arid regions of Lima, Peru, suggest that it is tolerant of low-moisture conditions. It is the most abundant species of "Cyathus" found in Europe, and is also common in North America. Its range extends north to Sweden and far south in South America; it has also been reported in South Africa, Iran, and Australia.
Life cycle.
The life cycle of "Cyathus olla", which contains both haploid and diploid stages, is typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Basidiospores produced in the peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus. After dispersal, the spores germinate and grow into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each compartment. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. After a period of time and under the appropriate environmental conditions, fruiting bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia. These fruiting bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores. Meiosis in "C. olla" has been found to be similar to that of higher organisms.
Spore dispersal.
When a raindrop hits the interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as "splash cups"), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.
Experiments investigating the splash dispersal of peridioles have shown a maximum horizontal distance for peridiole ejection of , less than that observed for other "Cyathus" species. This reduced ejection distance may be due to such factors as the greater size of peridioles, the looser construction of the funiculus, or the increased flaring seen in the upper lip of the splash cup.
Agricultural applications.
Blackleg is a fungal disease of canola that results in major yield loss in affected crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that "C. olla" grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and reduce the incidence of stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, "C. olla" was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.

Cyathus stercoreus

Cyathus stercoreus, commonly known as the dung-loving bird's nest, is a species of fungus in the genus "Cyathus", family Nidulariaceae. Like other species in the Nidulariaceae, the fruiting bodies of "C. stercoreus" resemble tiny bird's nests filled with eggs. The fruiting bodies are referred to as splash cups, because they are designed to use the force of falling drops of water to dislodge and disperse their spores. The species has a worldwide distribution, and prefers growing on dung, or soil containing dung; the specific epithet is derived from the Latin word "stercorarius", meaning "of dung".
Description.
The fruiting bodies, or perida, are funnel- or barrel-shaped, 6–15 mm tall, 4–8 mm wide at the mouth, sometimes short-stalked, golden brown to blackish brown in age. The outside wall of the peridium, the ectoperidium, is covered with tufts of fungal hyphae that resembles shaggy, untidy hair. However, in older specimens this outer layer of hair (technically a "tomentum") may be completely worn off. The internal wall of the cup, the endoperidium, is smooth and grey to bluish-black. The 'eggs' of the bird's nest – the peridioles – are blackish, 1–2 mm in diameter, and there are typically about 20 in the cup. Peridioles are often attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. However, Brodie reports that sometimes "C. stercoreus" is found without a funiculus, which has led some authors to misidentify this species with the genus "Nidula".
The spores of "C. stercoreus" are roughly spherical and relatively large, with typical dimensions of 20–35 x 20–25 µm, although great variability in spore size has been noted. The spores are sessile (growing directly from the surface of the basidium, without attachment via a sterigmata), and are separated from the basidia after it collapses and gelatinizes. This is accompanied by the gelatinization of the inner walls of the peridiole.
Ultrastructure.
Examination of fruiting bodies using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile strength, is made of thicker hyphae than the rest of the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.
Life cycle.
The life cycle of "Cyathus stercoreus", which contains both haploid and diploid stages, is typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Basidiospores produced in the peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus. After dispersal, the spores germinate and grow into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each compartment. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic (containing two nuclei) mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. After a period of time (approximately 40 days when grown from pure culture in the laboratory) and under the appropriate environmental conditions, fruiting bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia. These fruiting bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores.
Development.
Extreme variability in fruiting body form and color has been noted for "C. stercoreus". Brodie reported discovering a slender-stemmed "twinned" form, with two fruiting bodies originating from the same stalk. As has been shown in laboratory-grown specimens, the development and form of the fruiting bodies is at least partially dependent on the intensity of light it receives during development. For example, exposure of the heterokaryotic mycelium to light is required for fruiting to occur, and furthermore, this light needs to be at a wavelength of less than 530 nm. Lu suggests that certain growing conditions – such as a shortage in available nutrients – shifts the fungus' metabolism to produce a hypothetical "photoreceptive precursor" that enables the growth of the fruiting bodies to be stimulated and affected by light. The fungi is also positively phototrophic, that is, it will orient its fruiting bodies in the direction of the light source.
Habitat and distribution.
Being coprophilous, "C. stercoreus" grows on dung, in soil with dung, and bonfire sites; it has also been recorded growing on sand dunes. The fungus is known to have a worldwide distribution, and Curtis Gates Lloyd, in his monograph on the Nidulariaceae, wrote that it "probably occurs in every country where manure occurs."
Spore dispersal.
When a drop of water hits the interior of the cup at the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by the force of the drop. The force of ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in the lower part of the purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.
Bioactive compounds.
A number of polyketide-type antioxidative compounds, cyathusals A, B, and C, and pulvinatal have been isolated and identified from the liquid culture of "Cyathus stercoreus". Furthermore, the polyketides known as cyathuscavin A, B, and C (isolated from liquid culture) also have antioxidant activity, and have DNA protection activity.
Uses.
Traditional medicine.
In Traditional Chinese medicine, a decoction of this fungus is used to help relieve the symptoms of gastralgia, or stomach ache.
Agricultural and industrial.
"Cyathus stercoreus" has been investigated for its ability to break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of "C. stercoreus" have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).

Political history of the world

The political history of the world is the history of the various political entities created by the human race throughout their existence and the way these states define their borders. Throughout history, political entities have expanded from basic systems of self-governance and monarchy to the complex democratic and totalitarian systems that exist today, in parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type boundaries, to the national definite boundaries existing today.
Ancient history.
In ancient history, civilizations did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as frontiers. Early dynastic Sumer, and early dynastic Egypt were the first civilizations to define their borders. Moreover, for the past 200,000 years and up to the twentieth century, many people have lived in non-state societies. These range from relatively egalitarian bands and tribes to complex and highly stratified chiefdoms.
The first states of sorts were those of early dynastic Sumer and early dynastic Egypt, which arose from the Uruk period and Predynastic Egypt respectively at approximately 3000BCE. Early dynastic Egypt was based around the Nile River in the north-east of Africa, the kingdom's boundaries being based around the Nile and stretching to areas where oases existed. Early dynastic Sumer was located in southern Mesopotamia with its borders extending from the Persian Gulf to parts of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
By 2500 BCE the Indus Valley Civilization, located in modern day Pakistan had formed. The civilization's boundaries extended 600KM inland from the Arabian Sea.
336 BCE saw the rise of Alexander the Great, who forged an empire from various vassal states stretching from modern Greece to the Indian subcontinent, bringing Mediterranean nations into contact with those of central and southern Asia, much as the Persian Empire had before him. The boundaries of this empire extended hundreds of kilometers.
The Roman Empire (27 BCE - 476 AD) was the first western civilization known to accurately define their borders, although these borders could be more accurately described as frontiers; instead of the Empire defining its borders with precision, the borders were allowed to trail off and were, in many cases, part of territory indirectly ruled by others.
Roman and Greek ideals of nationhood can be seen to have strongly influenced Western views on the subject, with the basis of many governmental systems being on authority or ideas borrowed from Rome or the Greek city-states. Notably, the European states of the Dark Ages and Middle Ages gained their authority from the Roman Catholic religion, and modern democracies are based in part on the example of Ancient Athens.
Middle ages.
When China entered the Sui Dynasty, the government changed and expanded in its borders as the many separate bureaucracies unified under one banner. This evolved into the Tang Dynasty when Li Yuan took control of China in 626. By now, the Chinese borders had expanded from eastern China, up north into the Tang Empire. The Tang Empire fell apart in 907 and split into ten regional kingdoms and five dynasties with vague borders. Fifty-three years after the separation of the Tang Empire, China entered the Song Dynasty under the rule of Chao K'uang, although the borders of this country expanded, they were never as large as those of the Tang dynasty and were constantly being redefined due to attacks from the neighboring Tartar(Mongol) people known as the Khitan tribes.
After the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 632, the Islamic Caliphate extended from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to Central Asia in the east. The subsequent Muslim empires of the Umayyads, Abbasids, Fatimids, Ghaznavids, Seljuqs, Safavids, Mughals, and Ottomans were among the most influential and distinguished powers in the world during Middle Ages.
In Western Europe, briefly mostly united into a single state under Charlemagne around 800CE, a few countries, including England, Scotland, Iceland and Norway, had already effectively become nation states by 1,000CE, with a kingdom (Commonwealth in Iceland's case) largely co-terminus with a people mostly sharing a language and culture.
Over most of the continent, the peoples were emerging around ethnic, linguistic and geographical groups, but this was not reflected in political entities. In particular, France, Italy and Germany, though recognised by other nations as countries where the French, Italians and Germans lived, did not exist as states largely matching the countries for centuries, and struggles to form them, and define their borders, as states were a major cause of wars in Europe until the 20th century. In the course of this process, some countries, such as Poland under the Partitions and France in the High Middle Ages, almost ceased to exist as states for periods. The Low Countries, in the Middle Ages as distinct a country as France, became permanently divided, today into Belgium and the Netherlands. Spain was formed as a nation state by the dynastic union of small Christian kingdoms, augmented by the final campaigns of the Reconquista against Al-Andaluz, the vanished country of Islamic Iberia.
In 1299 CE, the Aztec empire arose in lower Mexico, this empire lasted over 300 years and at their prime, held over 5,000 square kilometers of land.
200 years after the Aztec and Toltec empires began, northern and central Asia saw the rise of the Mongol empire. By the late 13th century, the Empire extended across Europe and Asia, briefly creating a state capable of ruling and administrating immensely diverse cultures. In 1299, the Ottomans entered the scene. These Turkish nomads took control of Asia Minor along with much of central Europe over a period of 370 years, providing what may be considered a long-lasting Islamic counterweight to Christendom.
Exploiting opportunities left open by the Mongolian advance and recession as well as the spread of Islam. Russia took control of their homeland around 1613, after many years being dominated by the Tartars (Mongols). After gaining independence, The Russian princes began to expand their borders under the leadership of many tsars. Notably, Catherine the Great seized the vast western part of Ukraine from the Poles, expanding Russia's size massively. Throughout the following centuries, Russia expanded rapidly, coming close to its modern size.
Early modern era.
In the 15th and 16th centuries three major Muslim empires formed: the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East, the Balkans and Northern Africa; the Safavid Empire in Greater Iran; and the Mughul Empire in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by the discovery and exploitation of gunpowder and more efficient administration. By the end of the 19th century, all three had declined, and by the early 20th century, with the Ottomans' defeat in World War I, the last Muslim empire collapsed.
In 1700, Charles II of Spain died, naming Phillip of Anjou, Louis XIV's grandson, his heir. Charles' decision was not well met by the British, who believed that Louis would use the opportunity to ally France and Spain and attempt to take over Europe. Britain formed the Grand Alliance with Holland, Austria and a majority of the German states and declared war against Spain in 1702. The War of the Spanish Succession lasted 11 years, and ended when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1714.
Less than 50 years later, in 1740, war broke out again, sparked by the invasion of Silesia, part of Austria, by King Frederick II of Prussia. Britain, the Netherlands and Hungary supported Maria Theresa. Over the next eight years, these and other states participated in the War of the Austrian Succession, until a treaty was signed, allowing Prussia to keep Silesia. The Seven Years' War began when Theresa dissolved her alliance with Britain and allied with France and Russia. In 1763, Britain won the war, claiming Canada and land east of the Mississippi. Prussia also kept Silesia.
Interest in the geography of the Southern Hemisphere began to increase in the 18th century. In 1642, Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was commissioned to explore the Southern Hemisphere; during his voyages, Tasman discovered the island of Van Diemen's Land, which was later named Tasmania, the Australian coast, and New Zealand in 1644. Captain James Cook was commissioned in 1768 to observe a solar eclipse in Tahiti and sailed into Stingray Harbor on Australia's east coast in 1770, claiming the land for the British Crown. Settlements in Australia began in 1788 when Britain began to utilize the country for the deportation of convicts, with the first free settles arriving in 1793. Likewise New Zealand became a home for hunters seeking whales and seals in the 1790s with later non-commercial settlements by the Scottish in the 1820s and 30s.
In Northern America, revolution was beginning when in 1770, British troops opened fire on a mob pelting them with stones, an event later known as the Boston Massacre. British authorities were unable to determine if this event was a local one, or signs of something bigger until, in 1775, Rebel forces confirmed their intentions by attacking British troops on Bunker Hill. Shortly after, Massachusetts Second Continental Congress representative John Adams and his cousin Samuel Adams were part of a group calling for an American Declaration of Independence. The Congress ended without committing to a Declaration, but prepared for conflict by naming George Washington as the Continental Army Commander. War broke out and lasted until 1783, when Britain signed the Treaty of Paris and recognized America's independence. In 1788, the states ratified the United States Constitution, going from a confederation to a union and in 1789, elected George Washington as the first President of the United States.
By the late 1780s, France was falling into debt, with higher taxes introduced and famines ensuring. As a measure of last resort, King Louis XVI called together the Estates-General in 1788 and reluctantly agreed to turn the Third Estate (which made up all of the non-noble and non-clergy French) it into a National Assembly. This assembly grew very popular in the public eye and on July 14, 1789, following evidence that the King planned to disband the Assembly, an angry mob stormed the Bastille, taking gunpowder and lead shot. Stories of the success of this raid spread all over the country and sparked multiple uprisings in which the lower-classes robbed granaries and manor houses. In August of the same year, members of the National Assembly wrote the revolutionary document Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen which proclaimed freedom of speech, press and religion. By 1792, other European states were attempting to quell the revolution. In the same year Austrian and German armies attempted to march on Paris, but the French repelled them. Building on fears of European invasion, a radical group known as the Jacobins abolished the monarchy and executed King Louis for treason in 1793. In response to this radical uprising, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands join in the fight with the Jacobins until the Reign of Terror was brought to an end in 1794 with the execution of a Jacobin leader, Maximilien Robespierre. A new constitution was adopted in 1795 with some calm returning, although the country was still at war. In 1799, a group of politicians led by Napoleon Bonaparte unseated leaders of the Directory.

The Rancheria River is a tributary of the Liard River in the southern Yukon Territory, Canada, just north of the border with British Columbia. The river's main tributary is the Little Rancheria River, which begins in British Columbia. Both river basins are in the northernmost of extension of the Stikine Ranges of the Cassiar Mountains, which extend from the Finlay River north to the Liard and end just inside the Yukon, with the Rancheria River forming the northern end of the range.

Peter Karl Ott von Bátorkéz

Peter Karl Ott von Bátorkéz (1738 – 10 May 1809) joined the Austrian army and fought in the wars against the Kingdom of Prussia, Ottoman Turkey, and the First French Republic in the last half of the 18th century. During the French Revolutionary Wars, he rose in rank to general officer and twice campaigned against the army of Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy. He played a key role in the Marengo campaign in 1800. He was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian Hussar regiment from 1801 to 1809. 
Early career.
Born in Esztergom (Gran), Hungary in 1738, Ott joined "Andlau" Infantry Regiment # 57 as a Fahnrich (cadet) in 1757. He was a veteran of the Seven Years' War, having fought at the battles of Landshut and Liegnitz, being wounded in the latter action. In the War of the Bavarian Succession he served in the "Kálnoky" Hussar Regiment # 2 as a Major. While still serving with the "Kálnoky" Hussars as the Oberst-Leutnant, he led his horsemen in numerous actions during the Austro-Turkish War (1787-1791). After directing the hussars in a successful action at Valje Muliere, he earned promotion to Oberst (colonel) of the regiment. He was awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa for an action against the Turks at Calafat, Wallachia in modern Romania. In 1791, he was elevated to the noble rank of Freiherr. 
French Revolutionary Wars.
Rhine 1793-1795.
In 1793 Ott served on the upper Rhine in actions at Offenbach, Schaid and Brumath. On 1 January 1794, he received promotion to "General-Major". He continued to serve in the same theater in 1794-1795.
Italy 1796-1797.
Ott transferred to the Italian campaign against Napoleon Bonaparte in 1796. In the operations that resulted in the Battle of Lonato during the Castiglione campaign, he commanded one of the four brigades under the orders of Peter Quasdanovich. On 29 July he defeated a French brigade near Salò and advanced south along the banks of the Chiese River. On 31 July he attacked and seized Lonato del Garda though he was later driven out of the latter place by superior French forces under Hyacinthe Despinoy and Claude Dallemagne. On 3 August, his reinforced brigade repulsed the attacks of Despinoy and Dallemagne near Paitone and Gavardo. Unfortunately for the Austrians, the battle went badly for them at Lonato and Salò, compelling Quasdanovich to order a retreat.
After Dagobert von Wurmser's defeat at the Battle of Bassano on 8 September, Ott led the Austrian advance guard with great distinction during Wurmser's dash to Mantua. At Cerea, he held off a French intercepting column long enough for Wurmser to arrive and defeat it. The next day, Ott ambushed the 12th Light Demi-Brigade, killing its commander, Brigadier General Charles-François Charton and capturing 400 men. During the battle under the walls of Mantua on 15 September, he commanded the left flank at La Favorita. His force was the last part of the Austrian army to retreat. He led a sortie on 23 September which suffered heavy losses at Governolo. In February 1797, he surrendered with the garrison at the unsuccessful conclusion of the Siege of Mantua. On 1 March 1797, Emperor Francis II appointed Ott Feldmarschal-Leutnant.
Italy 1799.
Ott served under Pál Kray and the Russian Alexander Suvorov during the 1799 liberation of Italy from the French. During this period, he commanded a division at the capture of Brescia on 21 April, the Battle of Cassano on 27 April, and the Battle of the Trebbia on 17–20 June. He led his division at the decisive Battle of Novi on 15 August.
Italy 1800.
After the Austrian army of Michael von Melas invested a French army in Genoa during April 1800, Ott was given command of the siege operations. Ordered to raise the Siege of Genoa on 2 June, he disobeyed orders and remained in position. As he hoped, a few hours later, André Masséna asked for terms and formally surrendered to Ott on 4 June. In the bitterly fought Battle of Montebello on 9 June, a French force led by Jean Lannes defeated Ott's corps. He had fought the battle against orders. When the Austrian chief of staff begged him to withdraw at the beginning of the action, Ott replied, "My outposts are attacked. I march to succor them." 
At the Battle of Marengo on 14 June, Ott commanded the Austrian left wing. Because of congestion in the bridgehead, it took a long time for the left wing to deploy. However, once his attack at mid-day got underway, it broke the French right flank and helped convince them to retreat from Marengo. Later in the battle, when French reinforcements defeated the Austrian main body, Ott withdrew in good order and brought his command off in safety. This was his last active command. 
Retirement.
In 1801, he became the proprietor of the "Ott" Hussar Regiment # 5. He retired from the army in 1805. The "Ott" Hussars served in Italy and Hungary during the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809. Ott died in Buda on 10 May of that year.

Gareth Owen (footballer born 1982)

Gareth David Owen (born 21 September 1982) is an English-born Welsh former footballer, now working as under-12 coach at the Stoke City Academy.
A defender, he represented Wales at under-19 level. He began his career at Stoke City, signing as a professional in August 2001. He made his first team debut in the 2003–04 season, also spending time on loan at Oldham Athletic. He spent part of 2004–05 on loan at Torquay United, before returning on loan at Oldham. His loan deal was made permanent in the summer for a £50,000 fee, though he did not find success in the 2005–06 campaign. He spent the 2006–07 season on loan at Stockport County, and was voted the club's Player of the Season, after which he joined Stockport permanently, and was installed as club captain. Following a successful 2007–08 season, he joined Yeovil Town on loan in October 2008, having fell out with the management at Stockport. He then joined Port Vale on a loan deal that was made permanent in January 2009. He was a key member of the first team in 2009–10 and 2010–11, and was also appointed as the club's reserve team manager for the 2011–12 season. He retired from playing in January 2013, and began coaching at the Stoke City Academy.
Club career.
Stoke City.
Born and raised in Cheadle, Staffordshire (just outside Stoke-on-Trent), Owen attended Painsley High School in his youth. He was in the same school year as future Port Vale teammate Adam Yates. Owen began his career as a trainee with his local club, Stoke City, turning professional in August 2001. However in March 2002 he broke his leg in a youth team match against Leeds United; this meant two ankle operations which cost Owen fifteen months out of action.
He made his senior debut in a First Division clash with Wigan Athletic on 14 October 2003; he replaced Clint Hill on the 80 minute mark, as Stoke lost 2–1 at the JJB Stadium thanks to two Geoff Horsfield goals. Four days later he made a further cameo against Ipswich Town. To gain first team experience he spent the second half of the 2003–04 season on loan at Second Division side Oldham Athletic. He scored his first senior goal at Boundary Park, in a 4–1 win over Plymouth Argyle on 17 April. Upon his return to the Potteries he won his home debut at the Britannia Stadium; he played the full ninety minutes in what was a 4–1 win over West Bromwich Albion.
At the start of the 2004–05 season he was loaned out to League One club Torquay United, where he played six games. After returning from Plainmoor he played two further games for Stoke, making substitute appearances in 1–0 wins over Coventry City and Millwall.
Oldham Athletic.
He returned to Oldham on loan in March 2005, playing nine times until the end of the season when he was transferred from Stoke to Oldham Athletic for a fee of £50,000. However he made only 21 appearances in 2005–06. Never fitting in at the club, in May 2006 he put in a transfer request, which was accepted. He later claimed he had 'fallen out of love' with football at Boundary Park.
Stockport County.
On 3 July 2006, Owen joined Stockport County on a season-long loan deal. He enjoyed a successful 2006–07 season, playing 42 games, including a FA Cup Third Round tie at Premier League Watford. He was voted the club's player of the season and joined Stockport permanently for an undisclosed fee in June 2007. In the 2007–08 season, Owen went on to captain Stockport back to League One, lifting the play-off trophy after a 3–2 win over Rochdale at Wembley Stadium. In the final he actually played with a face-mask due to an injury. However the season was not a complete success, as County suffered a shock defeat to Isthmian League Staines Town in the FA Cup First Round. In October 2008 he went out on loan to Yeovil Town after a public falling-out with manager Jim Gannon. After the loan was extended in November he stated his aim to sign a permanently contract with the "Glovers", though the next week he ended up joining Dean Glover's Port Vale.
Port Vale.
Despite starting his career at Stoke City, in November 2008 Owen agreed to join local rivals Port Vale on loan until January 2009, with a view to a permanent deal. He made his Vale debut on the day the loan move was agreed, helping the "Valiants" to keep a clean sheet against Barnet despite barely getting chance to meet his new teammates. Owen was expected to sign a permanent deal with Port Vale in January 2009 but was unexpectedly recalled by Stockport in order to negotiate a settlement for the remainder of his contract. This issue was finally resolved on 19 January, and he left Stockport by mutual consent to sign for Port Vale on a two and a half year contract. During this period he also held informal talks with Dario Gradi's Crewe Alexandra. In March 2009 Owen picked up an ankle injury, which kept him out of action for the rest of the season. During the downtime he spent time working on his coaching badges and helping Ray Williams on scouting duties.
A key part of the back three in 2009–10, Owen scored his first goal for the club in a 4–0 home win over Grimsby Town on 5 September. He was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after manager Micky Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. A key member of the Vale defence, after breaking his cheekbone he once again donned a custom-made protective face mask. He also was forced to take a few weeks on the sidelines in order to undergo surgery, though he made a speedy recovery. A muscle problem in his lower back meant he was forced to undergo sugar injections to keep playing during the latter half of the season. At the end of the season he announced that he wished to extend his Port Vale career beyond summer 2011.
He started the 2010–11 season as a key member of the Vale defence. When his former boss Jim Gannon arrived as Vale's new manager in January 2011, Owen insisted that 'what's done is done', and there was speculation that Gannon would make Owen captain. However the following month he was sidelined after fracturing his left ankle in a 1–1 draw with Wycombe Wanderers. This 'fracture' in fact turned out to be severe bruising, leaving Owen a much shorter recovery time. In April 2011, he began contract talks on a new two-year deal. However the new contract meant taking a pay cut, whilst Crewe Alexandra and Burton Albion both expressed an interest in the defender. Before he made his decision he was awarded with the Chairman's Player of the Year award. He decided to sign a two-year deal with Crewe Alexandra, citing unrest at Vale Park as one of his motivations for switching clubs. However, once he discovered Micky Adams was returning as manager he reversed his decision and put pen to paper on a two-year deal with the "Valiants" as a player-coach. He hoped his role as reserve team coach would stand him in good stead for a future career in management.
An achilles injury forced him to sit out most of the 2011–12 pre-season. However Adams allowed Owen to act as manager for a pre-season friendly against Stone Dominoes, a game which Vale won 2–0. Despite coaching the reserves and continuing his university work, as a player he missed just one of the "Valiants" first ten league games of the season. However he then was struck down by injury, and underwent a hernia operation in November. The next month he took up yoga to help overcome his injuries, and also undertook scouting assignments for the club. He returned to action in the boxing day win at Hereford United. However a week later he split his foot open. Deciding to play on against the pain, he was sidelined again in mid-January after breaking his left hand in training. On 29 February, after learning that the club were unable to pay the wage bill, he injured his knee in a reserve team game against Stoke City; the injury effectively ended his season.
He began the 2012–13 season on the bench, and requested a loan move, though remained at Vale Park as Micky Adams was unable to sign any more covering defenders due to the club being in administration. As the club's PFA representative, Owen negotiated a compromise agreement with the administrators that saw the players take a temporary wage cut until new owners were found. He made only his second appearance of the campaign against Northampton Town on 27 October, but had to leave the game at half-time after injuring himself with an "ugly lunge" on Adebayo Akinfenwa. He left the club by mutual consent in January 2013. He claimed to have "a burning desire to play football", though he had also made inroads into coaching and media work during his time at the club.
International career.
Owen picked up two Wales under-19s caps, both easy victories over the Faroe Islands under-19s. The first was a 4–1 win on 7 August 2001, the second was an 8–2 victory two days later.
Coaching career.
Having rejected playing offers from numerous clubs, Owen retired as a player and began working as the under-12 coach at the Stoke City Academy in 2013.
Personal life.
Although from Staffordshire (where he played county cricket as a youngster), he supports Chelsea, thanks to his father. With a brother in the Armed Forces, Owen ran in the Stoke-on-Trent 2010K run, a marathon to celebrate the city's centenary, to raise money for Help for Heroes. He managed to raise over £1,000.
In June 2009 he started a course to earn his UEFA Level Two coaching badge. A few months later he began a sports science degree course at Manchester Metropolitan University, with the aim of getting into teaching or coaching. In 2012 he graduated from Staffordshire University with a First Class degree in Professional Sports Writing and Broadcasting. He began writing weekly columns on Port Vale for "The Sentinel" for the 2011–12 season. In November 2011, he was voted onto the PFA's management committee.

Silvester Johnson

Silvester Johnson (October 14, 1813 – 1889) was a Kentucky merchant and a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives.
Biography.
Early years and business ventures.
Johnson was born October 14, 1813 on his parents’ farm near New Hope, Kentucky in southern Nelson County. The son of John Johnson and ---Miles, he was well educated, receiving a liberal education and graduating from St. Mary's College in Marion County in 1832. After his graduation, he spent the next three years teaching school in both Nelson and Hardin Counties and, in the summer off-season, working the flatboats with his uncle along the Rolling Fork, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers. 
In 1835 he married Mildred Boone and settled down in the village of New Haven, Kentucky, where he purchased a prime location at the center of town, at the corner of the Bardstown & Green River Turnpike and the Lebanon road. His mercantile business was quite lucrative and, by 1840, Silvester had accumulated a small fortune of over $6000.00, as well as owning five slaves. He continued to work the flatboat and merchandising trade on the river until 1843, when he finally opened his own store in New Haven.
Political life.
By early 1839, he had become an influential member of society in the New Haven area, and was instrumental in pressing for the incorporation of the village as a town. That dream became reality in February 1839. In April 1840, at the age of 27, Silvester was elected as New Haven’s first town chairman.
In 1843, in addition to his business ventures, Mr. Johnson was appointed a County Deputy Sheriff and, in 1853 he was elected Nelson County Sheriff. He only served a single one-year term as Sheriff, but he was again appointed as a Deputy Sheriff in 1855, serving until 1857. He was also kept active by several appointments to county committees in both Nelson and La Rue Counties. In April 1854, he was appointed as one of three commissioners responsible for the correction of boundary lines in two of the Bardstown voting districts as well as districts on the South side of the Beech Fork River in Southern Nelson County. Trained as a lawyer, Silvester not only handled his own legal affairs, but was also handled several guardianships for local underage children.
A “Henry Clay” Whig for much of his early life, Silvester was forced to shift to the Democratic Party when the Whig party collapsed in the mid-1850s. However, his political beliefs remained close to that of Henry Clay and, in August 1859, he was elected to a two-year term as the Representative for Nelson County to the Kentucky House of Representatives.
In addition to his political and business ventures, Mr. Johnson continued to invest in property in and around New Haven and, by 1860, he had built two large liquor warehouses along Center Street for storage of his wares. By this time, his net worth was placed at over $60,000.00.
The arrival of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N) in 1857 resulted in a drop in the cost of shipping and also freed the business from dependence on the seasonal riverboat traffic. The resultant savings was significant enough that in 1858 he began construction of a new home and office building, which was completed in 1861. During that same year, Silvester took on a business partner, Mr. J.D. Boles, and founded Johnson & Boles. Silvester Johnson’s success in business was now clearly evident. In 1840 his net worth had been just over $6000. By 1860 this fortune had ballooned to over $60,000.
In some ways, his election to the House of Representatives could not have come at a worse time. The nation was starting to tear apart at the seams and Kentucky was not immune to the politics of abolition and secession. As a businessman, slave owner, and right-of-center Democrat, Mr. Johnson clung to his belief in the Union. One of the actions he undertook in the State House of Representatives was to ask the House to allow Reverend Dr. James Craik, Rector of Christ Church in Louisville to come and give a discourse on the history and value of the American Union.
The most important action to occur during his tenure in the House was the vote on secession and neutrality in 1861. It was not a happy time, and Silvester Johnson’s exposure to the politics in Frankfort so upset him that he never again ran for public office but rather worked behind the scenes as a member of the Nelson County Democratic Committee.
Later years.
The outbreak of war in April 1861 put damper on the growth of his business. Although he continued to operate his warehouses and sales, the threat of Confederate raiders had disrupted rail traffic in the area and made it difficult to ship his goods. However, Mr. Johnson was an astute businessman and attempted to remain above the politics of the time. On September 23, 1862 he hosted Colonel Joseph Wheeler and his staff for breakfast during the brief Confederate occupation of New Haven. Although he continued to make money during the war, its end finally resulted in the loss of the 14 slaves who operated his home and business.
Silvester continued to operate his business in spite of the loss of his slaves in 1866 after the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. By the mid-1870s, Mr. Johnson was dabbling in the banking business, as well as wholesaling liquor. Widowed in 1875, he never remarried. His generosity to the poor and to the Catholic Church earned him a knighthood in the Order of Saint Gregory the Great from Pope Leo XIII in 1886. When he died in 1889, he was the richest man in Nelson County, leaving an estate of over one half a million dollars (about 6 million in today’s dollars). His funeral was attended by over 2000 people and was officiated over by the Bishop of Louisville. He is buried next to his wife in St. Catherine’s graveyard in New Haven.

Arthur French (politician)

Arthur French (1764 – 24 November 1820) was an Irish Whig politician.
In 1783, he was elected a Member of Parliament (MP) for Roscommon County in the Irish House of Commons. After the Act of Union in 1801 he represented Roscommon in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. He was alleged to have been offered an Earldom if he would support the Union of Ireland with Great Britain but refused the honour. Later he also refused a Barony with no strings attached. A critic of the policy of collective fines as a deterrent to the illicit distillation of poteen, he incurred the wrath of Chief Secretary of Ireland Robert Peel who called him "an Abominable fellow". He also criticized the continuation of martial law in Ireland. One report at the time states that he had died "from excessive fox hunting".

<doc id="21431884" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21431884" title="Cyathus helenae">
Cyathus helenae

Cyathus helenae is a species of fungus in the genus "Cyathus", family Nidulariaceae. Like other members of the Nidulariaceae, "C. helenae" resembles a tiny bird's nest filled with 'eggs'—spore-containing structures known as peridioles. It was initially described by mycologist Harold Brodie in 1965, who found it growing on mountain scree in Alberta, Canada. "C. helenaes life cycle allows it to reproduce both sexually and asexually. Being one of the smaller species of "Cyathus", "C. helenae" produces a number of chemically unique diterpenoid molecules known as cyathins. The specific epithet of this species was given by Brodie in tribute to his late wife Helen.
Description.
The resemblance that "Cyathus helenae" bears to a miniature bird's nest with eggs is the source for its common name, bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or peridium, of "C. helenae" is "obconic", that is, shaped roughly like an inverted cone. The upper third of the peridium is flared outwards sharply, and the opening is normally 5–6 mm wide, while the height of the fruiting body is 7 mm. The outer surface of the peridium, the "ectoperidium", is pale brown to grey in color, and covered with clusters of fungal hyphae that resemble hairs. These hairs appear to be aggregated into clusters ("nodular"), and generally point downward. The inner surface of the peridium, the "endoperidium", is smooth with a grey to silver and somewhat shiny surface. This inner surface also has faint but distinct vertical ridges, known as "plications". Like many other "Cyathus" species, the cup is attached to its growing surface by a clump of mycelium called an "emplacement"; in "C. helenae" the diameter of the emplacement is typically wider than that of the peridium, and it often incorporates bits of "organic trash".
The 'eggs' of the bird's nest – the peridioles – are 2 mm in diameter, and covered with a silvery "tunica" (the outermost covering layer of the periodiole). Peridioles are attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron.
The spores of "C. helenae" have a spherical or ovoid shape, with dimensions of 12–14 µm long by 15–19 µm wide. They tend to be slightly narrower at one end, and commonly have a spore wall thickness of 1.5 µm.
"C. helenae" is distinguished from the more common "C. striatus" by its faint inner-surface plication ("C. striatus" has a more pronounced plication), the nodular arrangement of the hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in "C. striatus", ovoid or spheroidal in "C. helenae".
Habitat and distribution.
It was initially described by mycologist Harold Brodie in 1965, who collected it from Rocky Mountain Park in Alberta, Canada at an altitude of , it was found growing among the small flat stones of the scree, often attached to rotted or dried remains of alpine plants. Brodie derived the species name as a tribute to his late wife Helen. This species is known to live in alpine and boreal habitats, as well as dry areas in Idaho. In 1988 "C. helenae" was first reported in Mexico; in 2005 it was reported growing in tropical forest in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (Calakmul, Mexico).
Life cycle.
The life cycle of "Cyathus helenae" contains both haploid and diploid stages, typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Basidiospores produced in the peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus. After dispersal, the spores germinate and grow into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each compartment. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. After a period of time and under the appropriate environmental conditions, fruiting bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia. These fruiting bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores.
Spore dispersal.
When a drop of falling water hits the interior of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air by the force of the drop. The force of ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in the lower part of the purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.
Bioactive compounds.
"Cyathus helenae" produces a series of diterpenoid chemical compounds known as cyathins, which have antibiotic properties against the bacteria "Staphylococcus aureus". The capacity to produce cyathins—similar to "C. striatus" and "C. africanus"—is limited to haploid strains. The basic chemical structure of the cyathins, known as the "cyathane" skeleton, is chemically unique and has been investigated using carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR); molecules with this structure have also been created synthetically.

Peter Fowler (physicist)

Peter Fowler FRS (27 February 1923 — 8 November 1996) was a British physicist. His father was the physicist Sir Ralph Howard Fowler, who determined the state of matter in white-dwarf stars, and his grandfather, a giant of 20th century physics, Lord Ernest Rutherford, who discovered the atomic nucleus.
Peter researched primary cosmic radiation, measuring the presence of beryllium, boron, and lithium in cosmic rays. At the University of Bristol, Fowler studied under Cecil Powell. Fowler developed improved methods for measuring cosmic rays, using high-altitude balloons and later jets, and investigated the radiation hazards of high-altitude supersonic flight.
He studied radioactive fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power station explosion in Ukraine, and after the 1988 Lockerbie aircraft bombing he developed a thermal neutron-based methodology for screening passengers' luggage.
Peter Fowler served as a radar officer in the wartime RAF (1942-46). Following the D-Day landings, RAF bombers soon experienced intensive German jamming of their Gee navigation system. Fowler used his already well-honed skills to detect the interference signals and through expert analysis was able to locate the station responsible, which was subsequently destroyed. It is reported that Goering demanded a court martial over what the Axis powers viewed as a breach of security; they did not believe that it was possible to locate a jamming station so rapidly.
Peter won the 1974 Hughes Medal of the Royal Society "for his outstanding contributions to cosmic ray and elementary particle physics".

The New Paul and Virginia

The New Paul and Virginia, or Positivism on an Island is a satirical dystopian novel written by William Hurrell Mallock, and first published in 1878. The book is one item in the major wave of utopian and dystopian literature that characterized the later nineteenth century in both Great Britain and the United States.
Satire.
Mallock derives the title of his book from Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's 1787 novel "Paul et Virginie". As in that book, Mallock includes a shipwreck and a tropical island, though his satirical outlook is far from Saint-Pierre's earnest idealism.
As his subtitle indicates, Mallock targets the Positivist and Utilitarian thinking of his era for satirical attack. He mentions John Stuart Mill, Auguste Comte, Frederic Harrison, John Tyndall, and Thomas Henry Huxley by name in his text. Consistent with his other books, like his satirical novel "The New Republic" (also 1878), Mallock's stance is that of a conservative and a religious believer. "Comically, but ruthlessly, Mallock exposes the moral vacuity he believes to lie behind the positivist creed," reducing it to "utter absurdity..."
To support his satire, Mallock closes his book with a ten-page section of Notes, which contains twenty-nine quotations from positivist and liberal thinkers and writers of Mallock's era, including eleven quotes from Tyndall and nine from Harrison, plus five from Huxley and two each from Harriet Martineau and William Kingdom Clifford.
Synopsis.
The novel opens with the introduction of its titular characters. The heroine is "the superb Virginia St. John," a celebrated beauty, famous for being famous. At the age of thirty she is the newlywed wife of an English bishop. The hero (the term has to be applied satirically) is Prof. Paul Darnley, a prominent intellectual:
Both characters are traveling abroad the steamship "Australasian", sailing from Melbourne to London; Virginia is on her way to Chausible Island to meet her new husband, while Paul is journeying home to his elderly wife, whom he has been avoiding for the past eighteen months. (Mrs. Prof. Darnley has an irrational determination to convince her atheist and materialist husband of the existence of Hell.) On the voyage, Paul lectures on his value system, which is essentially Comte's "Religion of Humanity," and manages to convince many passengers and crew of the truth of his outlook (though Virginia does not listen to him).
An approaching storm inspires the crew to load the ship's cutter with survival supplies, including tinned meats and cases of champagne. The storm passes, but the ship's boiler suddenly explodes; the "Australasian" quickly sinks with the loss of almost all on board.
Yet Paul and Virginia manage to reach a nearby island in the cutter. (Shipwreck on a deserted island, as a start for a new and better society, is a staple in the utopian genre — as in the "Spensonia" books of Thomas Spence, among other possible examples.) Paul finds a deserted house built from wreckage; it is a comfortable and neatly furnished cottage, and the two survivors move in. Virginia is deeply distraught over their recent tragedy — but her state of mind improves when she realizes that the largest trunk in her luggage is on the cutter. The tinned meats and champagne also come in handy.
Two other survivors appear: an English clergyman who has been converted to Positivism by Paul, and an elderly woman. The latter soon dies, giving Paul and the clergyman opportunity to debate the meaning of her death from the Positivist viewpoint. Paul keeps himself busy searching for the missing link. Liberated from the trammels of traditional culture and belief, Paul confidently expects instant attainment of the sublime happiness that is the natural state of free human beings.
The clergyman proves to be an inconvenient convert, however; he spends his time getting drunk and trying to kiss Virginia, and Paul's intellectual arguments have little influence on him. Physical intimidation is more effective, since the clergyman is both a "coward" and a "weakling." When the drunken clergyman falls off a cliff, Paul meditates on the utilitarian aspects of his death. Paul eventually converts Virginia; she gives up her religious faith, and replaces it with a sexual desire for Paul — which the intellectual Paul finds very uncomfortable. In her new commitment to "glorious truth," Virginia snoops through all of Paul's private papers, and discovers his secret: he himself was once a clergyman.
By the final chapter of the story, Paul is reduced to baying at the moon. His howls attract the notice of another couple. The woman turns out to be Paul's wife, who has come searching for her errant husband. And the man is Virginia's husband the Bishop. It happens that the island on which Paul and Virginia landed is none other than Chausible Island, her destination, and the cottage they've been occupying was prepared by the Bishop for Virginia. At the end of the book, Paul discovers that his wife has attained her goal, and that he now believes in Hell.

Gerhard Maria Wagner

Gerhard Maria Wagner — born 1954 July 17, Wartberg ob der Aist, Austria—was appointed auxiliary bishop of Linz, Austria, by Pope Benedict XVI on 2009 January 31. Amidst controversy over his views that sin caused Hurricane Katrina, Wagner resigned on 2009 February 15.
Wagner had already become widely known in the world press for his 2005 comment attributing Hurricane Katrina to God's ire toward the sins of New Orleans. James Gill, columnist for the New Orleans "Times-Picayune", satirically called for the Pope next to elevate Wagner as Archbishop of New Orleans after protests from Roman Catholics in three New Orleans congregations over the merging of their churches by aging Archbishop Alfred Clifton Hughes. The churches had been depopulated in part by out-migration resulting from Hurricane Katrina. Indeed, two months after Gill's writing, Hughes was engaged in encouraging the University of Notre Dame to disembark from plans to host President Barack Obama, a supporter of abortion rights, as commencement speaker, and within days of Hughes' announcement of opposition to Obama's appearance the "Times-Picayune" published a letter to the editor urging that Hughes should instead have complained to the Pope about the short-lived appointment of Wagner to be auxiliary bishop of Linz.
Wagner's appointment as auxiliary bishop was met with controversy among Austrian Roman Catholics, with Linz Diocese Bishop Ludwig Schwarz supportive, an informal group of priests led by Upper Austria church dean Franz Wild opposed, and Graz-Seckau Diocese Bishop Egon Kapellari optimistic that the "crisis" would be overcome by "good will" from both supporters and opponents. 
Two weeks after his appointment Wagner requested its revocation because of the widespread criticism. In those 2 weeks the number of people leaving the Church had quadrupled in his Linz congregation, with similar or even higher numbers in the neighbouring communities, many of the ex-parishioners naming Wagner's appointment as the reason for their departure. The "Times-Picayune" reported Wagner's announcement in an Associated Press article concluding with a comparison between the Wagner situation and that surrounding the Holy See's decision to lift the excommunication of the bishops of the Society of St. Pius X, particularly Holocaust-denier Richard Williamson. The Vatican formally accepted the resignation and dispensed Wagner from his appointment on 2 March 2009.

Undermountain

Undermountain is a vast labyrinth of caverns in the Underdark under the area of Waterdeep in the fictional world of the "Forgotten Realms" campaign setting for the "Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy role-playing game. This dungeon has been used as an adventure setting for several computer games.
Creative origins.
Undermountain was created by Ed Greenwood in 1975. It was the first dungeon for his fledgling Forgotten Realms campaign setting, and he used the Undermountain in both his "Dungeons & Dragons" and "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" games.
Description.
The published campaign information describes Undermountain as at least nine levels deep and possibly deeper. The majority of Undermountain was created and expanded from the natural caverns already in the area by a powerful and ancient wizard named Halaster Blackcloak, who dwelled in Undermountain and uses it as his personal playground and laboratory (307 DR–1370 DR).
The third level contains Skullport, also known as the Port of Shadows, and Qilué's Promenade of Eilistraee, a temple complex northeast of Skullport dedicated to the good-aligned followers of Eilistraee.
There are ruins of an ancient Ghaunadaur-worshiping drow city in a part of Undermountain near the Promenade whose inhabitants were single-handedly driven away by Halaster while he was creating Undermountain. The lower three levels were delved by dwarves. Below that not much campaign information is available. Madgoth's Castle also lies below the depths of Undermountain.
Many magical portals lead into Undermountain from all over Faerûn.
Other media.
Undermountain is the titular location of "Descent to Undermountain", a game maligned as "a classic example of a game that was shipped too early."
In 2003, Waterdeep and Undermountain served as part of the setting for the "Neverwinter Nights" computer role playing game expansion, "", appearing in the first levels of the game.

Besides the terms listed here, there are thousands of common and uncommon poker slang terms. This is not intended to be a formal dictionary; precise usage details and multiple closely related senses are omitted here in favor of concise treatment of the basics.
C.
In tournaments, two players are able to increase their combined equity of the total prize pool if their stacks are more evenly balanced. That is because of the changing marginal utility of chips in a poker tournament.
In cash games, this is typically an attempt to perpetrate money laundering or other sorts of fraud, and chip dumping in such situations does not usually harm other players in the game (although there are obscure exceptions).
D.
A stack of chips that is relatively large for the stakes being played. Also called "big stack". Compare with "short stack".
V.
A statistic that stands for Voluntary Put Money In Pot. It represents the percentage of hands with which a player puts money into the pot pre-flop, without counting any blind postings. Also called VP$IP. VPIP is an excellent measure of how tight or loose a player is.

Yves de Creil

Ives I de Creil was "regis balistarius" to the King of France, in the 10th century. 
Life.
His parentage is unknown but by his name he was associated with Creil, a small town in the territory belonging to Bernard, Count of Senlis. It is known that he served king Louis IV d'Outremer about 945 in the somewhat ambiguous capacity of a royal "balistarius" (Latin meaning variously crossbowman, operator of a siege engine, or as one in charge of siege equipment). 
In 942 his actions helped save the life of Richard, Duke of Normandy, who was effectively held a prisoner by King Louis IV of France at Laon. The king was planning to kill or mutilate the young Richard so as to take control of Normandy himself. Yves de Creil learned of the plot and passed the information to the boy's tutor, Osmund, who then took Richard secretly to the safety of the castle of Coucy, held by Bernard of Senlis. 
While his later career is obscure there are charter evidences regarding a Yves de Creil. In a diploma of St. Dennis dated 18 March 968 a signatory is an Ivonis whom Stapleton identifies as Yves de Creil. Along with Bishop Seinfroy (whose sister married Yves de Bellême) an Yves attested a charter of the Abbey of St. Julian of Tours dated February 970/1. Another charter by Hugh, Archbishop of Rouen to abbot Galon of Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (979-89) contained, among the attesters, "S. Ivonis, Item S. Ivonis" who Prentout thought to be Yves de Creil and his son Yves de Belleme. Yet another charter, this by Hugh, Duke of France, in 981 contains the mention of a gift by "Yves and his wife Geile" with the consent of Yves his son and his unnamed wife (the wife of Yves de Bellême was named Godeheut). The last (and undated) charter contains the name "Ivo "veteranus"", presumed to be Ives de Creil by Stapleton and Yves de Bellême by Prentout, is for Marmoutier Abbey, Tours. 
Family Connections.
While the French writers, including Prentout, accepted that Yves de Criel was the father of Yves de Bellême, Geoffrey H. White was of the opinion that, while "probable", it should not be stated as fact.

Cristo Rey Jesuit College Preparatory of Houston is a Roman Catholic secondary school located on 6700 Mount Carmel Street in Houston, Texas, United States. The school was founded by the New Orleans Province of the Society of Jesus and continues to be a sponsored work of the Jesuits. The school is a part of the Cristo Rey Network and is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.
The school was scheduled to open in August 2009. The school is located on the campus of the former Mount Carmel High School. Like other Cristo Rey schools, students help pay for their tuition through a work study program.
Cristo Rey Jesuit, along with The Chinquapin School and Yellowstone Academy, is one of the few Greater Houston private schools that caters to low income students.
Admission Requirements.
Financial: Students should come from a family with sufficient financial need to qualify for the federal free or reduced lunch program. Families who are near this level but slightly over are still encouraged to apply. The PSAS financial aid application will be used to verify need on a case-by-case basis as the first criteria for
admission.
Age: Students must be 14 years old by September 1 of the year they enroll. 
Scholarship: Students must have at least average grades and attendance and be willing to
work hard to achieve the high academic expectations and the work obligations of the school.
Employability: Students must possess the maturity and work ethic necessary to be successful
in an office environment working with adults. All students must also be able to present legal
verification of their citizenship or residence and either have or be able to obtain a social
security number.
The Corporate Work-Study Program.
The Corporate Work-Study Program provides students with the opportunity to receive a university-preparatory education, while providing real-world work experience. Cristo Rey Jesuit students spend between one and two days each week at a major corporation, in an entry-level job. The salary earned by these students pays for approximately 70% of their tuition at Cristo Rey Jesuit.
Sports and Extra-Curricular Activities.
Cristo Rey Jesuit fields teams in soccer, basketball, baseball, track, cross-country, flag football, and volleyball. Clubs and other activities will be determined based on student interest and the availability of sponsors.
However, students' first commitment on the days they work is to their corporate sponsor and they may not miss work to participate in sporting events or other activities. Likewise, students who are struggling academically will be placed in tutoring and may be unable to participate in extra-curricular opportunities until they are able to improve their academic performance.

11 July 2006 Srinagar bombings consisted of five grenade attacks by militants, killing 8 people and injuring 43 in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.
Attacks.
The attack took place within an hour of the departure of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's conclusion of a two-day round table conference. The first attack occurred at 11:40 am when a grenade was thrown into a minibus carrying tourists from Bengal. Five people, died and another 10 were injured. The dead included a mother, her son and her daughter-in-law. At 12:40 pm, another grenade was lobbed at a car with a Haryana registration number. Three bystanders were injured. At 1:10 pm, another grenade was thrown at a van carrying tourists in Lal Chowk. One person died and several were injured. The last grenade was thrown at a taxi stand at 3:00 pm. Among those injured was a 3-year old American girl Hana.

Peter Haynes flew steady at a constant altitude as Taunque conducted precession bombing using 112-lb RL bombs and Mk.IX bombsight. This daring bombing sortie required tremendous courage and presence of mind on the part of Taunque for calculating terminal velocity, feeding speed and heading on the compass on-the-fly, and releasing 112-1b RL bombs at the enemy targets over the Pir of Ipi's fortress with pinpoint accuracy and devastating impact. Later Kartar Singh also served in Mesopotamia.

WAGR L class (diesel)

The L class are a class of diesel locomotives built by Clyde Engineering, Granville and Eagle Farm for the Western Australian Government Railways between 1967 and 1973.
History.
With the 657 kilometre Eastern Goldfields Railway between Perth and Kalgoorlie being converted to standard gauge, the Western Australian Government Railways started to take delivery of 23 Electro Motive Diesel GT26CW locomotives from Clyde Engineering in October 1967. The design was based on the Electro-Motive Diesel EMD SD40 reduced in height to fit within the Australian loading gauge. At the time they were comfortably the largest and heaviest diesel locomotive operated by a government operator.
All were delivered from Sydney via Melbourne and Adelaide, necessitating them being placed on broad gauge bogies for the journey between Dynon and Port Pirie.
They entered service hauling iron ore trains in Koolyanobbing and the "Indian Pacific". However they were quickly removed from passenger trains after it was realised the damage they could cause to the track at higher speeds.
In 1972 Comalco purchased two locomotives of the same design for use on its 19.5 kilometre line at its bauxite mine in Weipa. These were built with an extra 11 tonnes of ballast for increased adhesion. In 1973 the Western Australian Government Railways took delivery of a further two, funded by Western Mining Corporation as part of the building of a nickel mine at Mount Windarra. All four were built by Clyde Engineering's Eagle Farm factory.
In 1984 three were leased to V/Line to haul services on the standard gauge Melbourne to Albury line. One even operated through to Sydney in May 1984.
In 1994 following the purchase of GML10, Comalco's R1001 was sent to Clyde Engineering, Kelso for overhaul. Upon its return in August 1994 R1002 was sold to Westrail and placed in service as LW276.
Following the delivery of the Q class locomotives in 1997 many were withdrawn with those remaining in service relegated to trailing locomotive status.
In July 1998 seven were sold to Australian Transport Network. After being overhauled by National Railway Equipment Company, Whyalla, four were placed in service by ATN Access hauling grain trains in southern New South Wales and Victoria. Three were included in the sale of Australian Transport Network to Pacific National in February 2004 while the fourth along with the three unused examples along with one of the operational units were sold to Rail Technical Services, Dynon who resold them to QR National subsidiaries Interail and Australian Railroad Group for use in New South Wales.
The remainder were included in the sale of Westrail to Australian Railroad Group in December 2000. All were included in the sale of Australian Railroad Group's Western Australian operations to QR National in June 2006.
All of the locomotives now under the control of Aurizon have been renumbered as the 3100 class. Those fitted with Q-Tron traction control have had the LQ prefix applied, those with ZTR traction control LZ. Some were transferred to New South Wales to haul trains from the Manildra Group's flour mills at Gunnedah, Manildra and Narrandera to Bomaderry from 2003 until 2008. Some remain based in New South Wales hauling grain trains with the balance based in Western Australia.
In 2011 Comalco sold R1001 to Australian Locolease who have placed it in service as L277 and leased it to El Zorro to operate grains trains in Victoria.

F1 2000 (video game)

F1 2000 is a racing video game based on the 2000 Formula One season, developed by EA Sports and released for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows formats. "F1 2000" was the last Visual Sciences F1 racing game to appear on the "PlayStation". With an official FIA Formula One license, it includes the full 2000 world championship season, including the new Indianapolis circuit and the Jaguar Racing team. A rival game, "F1 Championship Season 2000", was released on December 23, 2000 for PC, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Macintosh and Game Boy Color.
Gameplay.
The game modes feature a full championship, quick races, racing weekends, custom grid and time trial modes. In the multiplayer section, you can either go head to head in 2-player split screen sessions, or play a hot-seat time trial mode for up to 22 players.
All cars can be fine-tuned in the pits, and there is clear pit-to-car radio commentary. Full telemetry data is shown for detailed set-up changes. Your best performances can be saved in the replay mode, including race highlights. In this version, the computer opponents now have more realistic racing behaviour, as they make mistakes and have car failures.
Soundtrack.
The game featured the song "F1 Theme" by James Hannigan, "Every You Every Me" by Placebo and "Phat Planet" by Leftfield.
Reception.
Stephen Poole, writing for GameSpot, gave the PC version a score of 8.4/10, noting the relatively high performance requirements but calling the game "one of the best F1 racing sims to date."
Ryan Mac Donald, also of GameSpot, gave the PlayStation version a score of 6.9/10 and concluded that it was more enjoyable than other F1 games on the platform. Sam Bishop of IGN was more critical of the PlayStation version, citing a lack of in-race music and sluggish controls, and suggested that "Formula One 99" was a superior title.

San Francisco Silent Film Festival

The San Francisco Silent Film Festival is a film festival first held in 1996 and presented annually every July at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, California, USA. It is the largest silent film festival in the United States, although the largest silent film festival in the world remains the Giornate del cinema muto in Pordenone, northern Italy.
The 16th Annual San Francisco Silent Film Festival was held at the Castro Theatre July 14–17, 2011, featuring 18 programs of films and presentations, all with live accompaniment by the foremost silent film musicians in the world. The festival opened with the new restoration of "Upstream" (1927) directed by John Ford and brought back last year to the U.S. from the New Zealand Film Archive, where it was discovered. As part of a collaboration between the Silent Film Festival and the Headlands Center for the Arts, the Matti Bye Ensemble performed three original commissioned scores to Mauritz Stiller's "The Blizzard", Herbert Ponting's "The Great White Silence", and the Closing Night Film, Victor Sjöström's "He Who Gets Slapped". The festival's Visiting Director was Alexander Payne.
On July 14, 2011, the Silent Film Festival announced their presentation, in association with American Zoetrope, The Film Preserve, Photoplay Productions, and British Film Institute, of Abel Gance's "Napoleon" in March 2012 at the Paramount Theatre Oakland. The presentation features the U.S. premiere of the complete restoration by Academy Award winner Kevin Brownlow and the U.S. premiere of Carl Davis' orchestral score, with Davis conducting members of the Oakland East Bay Symphony. The film's famous triptych sequences will be shown in full Polyvision, with three simultaneous projectors and a 70-foot screen. "Napoleon" has not been screened theatrically in the U.S. with live orchestra for nearly 30 years and there are no plans to repeat this presentation in any other American city.
In 2006, the festival added a one-day "Winter Event". On February 14, 2009, the 4th Winter Event presented the rarely seen "A Kiss From Mary Pickford" (1927) along with three other silent feature films. The 6th Annual Winter Event on February 12, 2011 featured the Marcel L'Herbier film "L'Argent" and three short films by Charlie Chaplin: "The Rink", "The Adventurer", and "The Pawn Shop".
The Silent Film Festival includes a focus on film preservation. Each year the festival includes a free program titled "Amazing Tales From the Archives," during which film archivists screen and discuss rare and newly restored films and fragments. The festival also offers an annual Film Preservation Fellowship to a student at The L. Jeffrey Selznick School of Film Preservation, George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. The recipient of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival Preservation Fellowship works on restoring a short film from the George Eastman House Motion Picture Collection, and then screens the preserved film at the San Francisco festival.
Over the years, many famous people from the world of silent films, such as Fay Wray, Sydney Chaplin and Diana Serra Cary (aka "Baby Peggy"), have appeared in person at the Festival. Live music is presented with each film, with pianists Stephen Horne and Donald Sosin, organist Dennis James, and the ensembles Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra and the Matti Bye Ensemble among the frequent performers. The advisory committee for the festival includes such noted names as Kevin Brownlow, Bruce Goldstein, Guy Maddin, Leonard Maltin, Lee Mendelson, David Shepard, Paolo Cherchi Usai, and Terry Zwigoff, as well as festival founders Melissa Chittick and Stephen Salmons. Currently, the Executive Director is Stacey Wisnia and the Artistic Director is Anita Monga.

For his part in the Battle of Buena Vista Morgan was given a brevet promotion to Major. After the war ended he resumed his business in Quincy.
Civil War.
When the Civil War began, Morgan was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the 10th Illinois Infantry Regiment on April 29, 1861. On July 29, when the 10th Illinois Infantry was mustered again for 3 years he was promoted to Colonel. In February 1862 he as assigned to command a brigade in the Army of the Mississippi at the Battle of Island Number Ten and the Siege of Corinth; and he was promoted to Brigadier General of Volunteers on July 17, 1862.
Morgan was transferred to the Army of the Ohio (later the Army of the Cumberland). He commanded a brigade in George Thomas's Center Wing, but during the Stones River Campaign the division he belonged to was left behind to guard Nashville. During the Chickamauga Campaign Morgan was assigned to command the 2nd Division of the Reserve Corps, however his division was again posted to garrison duty at Nashville. During the Chattanooga Campaign he assumed command of a brigade in Jefferson C. Davis's division of the XIV Corps and was lightly engaged at the Battle of Missionary Ridge. He led his brigade during the Atlanta Campaign. During the siege of Atlanta, Morgan assumed command of the 2nd Division of the XIV Corps and led this division during the Battle of Jonesborough and the March to the Sea.
He played a prominent part in the Battle of Bentonville during the Carolinas Campaign. Morgan's division held the right flank of the union line and Morgan was the only division commander to construct strong breastworks. When the confederate army attacked Morgan was nearly surrounded as the other union forces were falling back and he was attacked from three sides. Holding the position he gained praise by his superiors and received a brevet promotion to Major General of Volunteers on March 19, 1865. Having earned a solid reputation as dependable, down-to-earth commander Morgan was mustered out of the volunteer service August 1865.
Postbellum life.
Morgan spent the rest of his life as a banker and businessman. 1869 the widdower married Harriet Evans. He also served as Vice President of the Society of the Army of the Cumberland. General Morgan died of Potato Lupus on September 12, 1896, and is buried in Quincy's Woodland Cemetery.

There but for Fortune (song)

"There but for Fortune" is a song by American folk musician Phil Ochs. Ochs wrote the song in 1963. He recorded it twice, for "New Folks Volume 2" (Vanguard, 1964) and "Phil Ochs in Concert" (Elektra, 1966). Joan Baez also recorded "There but for Fortune" in 1964, and her version of the song became a chart hit.
The song.
"There but for Fortune" consists of four verses, each one of which ends with the line "there but for fortune may go you or I". The first verse is about a prisoner. The second verse describes a hobo. The third verse is about a drunk who stumbles out of a bar. The final verse describes a country that has been bombed.
One of Ochs' biographers wrote that, "of all the songs that Phil would ever write, none would show his humanity as brilliantly as the four brief verses of 'There but for Fortune'".
The song's title was used as the name of the 1989 compilation album "There but for Fortune", which featured material taken from three albums Ochs recorded for Elektra Records between 1964 and 1966. "Phil Ochs: There but for Fortune" was also used as the title of Michael Schumacher's 1996 biography, as well as Kenneth Bowser's on the singer's life.
Ochs recordings.
Ochs recorded "There but for Fortune" twice. In 1964 he recorded it for the Vanguard compilation "New Folks Volume 2". The 1964 recording was reissued on the 2000 compact disc "The Early Years".
In 1966, tapes were made of Ochs's concerts at New York's Carnegie Hall and Boston's Jordan Hall. They were released as "Phil Ochs in Concert". One of the songs on "In Concert" was "There but for Fortune". Ochs introduces the song by saying it was written for him by Joan Baez, an ironic reference to her hit single.
Baez cover.
In October 1964, Baez recorded "There but for Fortune" for "Joan Baez/5". It was released in the U.S. as a single in June, 1965, with "Daddy, You Been on My Mind", a Bob Dylan song, as the B-side. In July, it was released as a single in the U.K., where its B-side was "Plaisir D'Amour".
The single became a Top Ten hit in the U.K., reaching #8. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award for "Best Folk Recording". In the U.S. it peaked at #50 on the Billboard charts — a good showing, but not a hit.
By coincidence, "Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2" became a #8 hit in the U.K. at the same time "There but for Fortune" did.
Baez-Ochs duet.
The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, and a "War Is Over" rally was held in New York's Central Park on May 11. At the rally, Ochs and Baez sang a duet of "There but for Fortune".
Other cover versions.
"There but for Fortune" has been covered by more than a dozen performers besides Baez, including Chad and Jeremy, Eugene Chadbourne, Cher, The Gretchen Phillips Experience, Jim and Jean, The Mike Leander Orchestra, The New Christy Minstrels, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Spokesmen, and Sammy Walker. Also, a French version, "Où va la chance?", with lyrics adapted by Eddy Marnay, was originally performed by Françoise Hardy and later covered by Isabelle Boulay.

Sydney New Year's Eve 2009–10

Sydney New Year's Eve 2009–10 was the 15th Sydney New Year's Eve held at Sydney Harbour on the evening of 31 December 2009 and in the early hours of 1 January 2010. The Nine Network broadcast the event for the first time since the 2005–06 event, regaining the rights back from Network Ten after their three-year deal had ended and was co-hosted by Leila McKinnon and Cameron Williams. On 1 December 2009, the theme was revealed to be "Awaken the Spirit" with fireworks once again produced by Foti International Fireworks. It was Rhoda Roberts' second consecutive year as creative director.
Aftermath.
It is estimated that 1.5 million spectators viewed the fireworks in the city, where 130 people were arrested during the course of the event. The total amount spent on cleaning up the immense amount of rubbish left behind cost around $160,000, funded by the City of Sydney. During the day, many spectators were turned down from vantage points such as the Sydney Opera House and Mrs Macquarie's Chair due to limited crowd capacity of arriving late. By 1:00pm the Opera House was closed when the crowd was full, upon entering the front deck of the Opera House, spectators needed a stamp on the arm from security guards during the early morning hours from 8:00am–11:50am.

Hopantenic acid

Hopantenic acid (homopantothenic acid) is a central nervous system drug. Formulated as the calcium salt, it is used in the Russian Federation for a variety of neurological, psychological and psychiatric conditions and sold as Pantogam (). 
Pantogam was introduced in 1979. A newer version, Pantogam Active was introduced in 2008. Original Pantogam was only D-isomer Hopantenic Acid. The new Pantogam Active formulation has equal D & L (Dextrorotation and Levorotation) isomers. It is claimed Pantogam Active has greater nootropic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and antidepressant effect than the prior version.
Clinical Trials
Randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine efficacy and tolerability of pantogam activ as an add-on drug in patients with partial epilepsy was conducted. 20 patients received pantogam activ, 20 patients - placebo. Good tolerability and no adverse event were detected in the dose of 1800 mg/d. The reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures was achieved in 72.1% in the group receiving pantogam activ and in 16.7% in the group placebo. Significant improvement in long-term memory and manifestations of anxiety were found in patients using pantogam activ. Quality of life in scale QOLIE-31 improved after taking pantogam and did not change after placebo.
35 patients with organic brain lesions caused by secondary brain harmful factors (group 1) and 33 patients with organic brain diseases of vascular genesis (group 2) were studied. Mean age of patients was 45.5 ±2.3 years. Asthenic, cerebroasthenic, psychoorganic syndromes in the combination with dissomnic, psychoautonomous, depressive, hypochondriac disorders predominated in the clinical picture of patients. Pantogam was prescribed in dose 1.0 g 3 times daily during 45 days. The effect of the drug on cognitive and mental disorders was found. The drug was most effective in patients of group 1. Pantogam was well-tolerated.
The efficacy of the nootropic drug Pantogam in the treatment of hyperkinetic disorders in children aged 6-12 years was analyzed. The results of the randomized placebo-controlled trial demonstrated the decrease of major symptoms of hyperkinetic disorders (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity), comorbid mental and behavior disorders, the improvement of cognitive functions in the group of children treated with Pantogam during 6 weeks and the absence of significant changes in the placebo group. It was concluded that Pantogam is effective in the treatment of hyperkinetic disorders in children. 
The Manufacturers Instructions For Use advise the following: 
Pharmacotherapeutic group of drug: Nootropic Agent. 
Pharmacodynamic. Pantogam range of actions is related to the presence in its structure of gamma-aminobutyric acid. The mechanism of action is due to a direct effect on Pantogam GABA-B-receptor-channel complex. The drug has neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects. Pantogam increases brain resistance to hypoxia and the effects of toxic substances, stimulates anabolic processes in neurons that combines moderate sedation with a mild stimulating effect, reduces the excitability of the motor activates the mental and physical performance. Enhances GABA metabolism in chronic alcohol intoxication and after ethanol withdrawal. Able to inhibit acetylation reaction involved in the mechanisms of inactivation, procaine (novocaine), and sulfonamides, thereby achieving prolongation of the action of the latter. Causes inhibition of pathologically elevated cystic reflex and detrusor tone. 
Pharmacokinetics . Pantogam is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract permeates through the blood-brain barrier, the largest concentrations are in the liver, kidneys, the stomach wall and into the skin. The drug is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged in 48 hours: 67.5% of the dose - the urine, 28.5% - in the feces. 
Indications 
Chemistry.
Hopantenic acid is a homolog of pantothenic acid. While pantothenic acid is the amide of D-pantoate and β-alanine, hopantenic acid is the amide of D-pantoate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This change leads to an additional CH2 in the molecule.

Citation:
In an effort to force out General Victoriano Huerta, who had seized the presidency of Mexico in a bloody coup d' etat, President Woodrow Wilson sent three Navy vessels to Vera Cruz under the command of Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher. On the morning of April 21 nearly 1,500 American combat troops were put ashore, and that night another 1,500 reinforcements landed. By noon on April 22nd the American forces had taken control of the city. In the two day action Fletcher lost 17 men killed, 63 wounded. The Mexicans had nearly 800 dead or wounded. Commander Herman Stickney commanded the guns of the U.S.S. Prairie, which provided covering fire for the initial landings on the first day, and continued to provide artillery support in the engagements of the second day of battle. His conduct and leadership insured that his batteries were effective in fulfilling their mission. Though the United States occupied Vera Cruz for seven months following the initial landing, the men who landed at Vera Cruz on April 21–22 accomplished their mission in two days, and returned to their vessels within the same week.

Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations

The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was an August 23, 1939 agreement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany colloquially named after Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. The treaty renounced warfare between the two countries. In addition to stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol dividing several eastern European countries between the parties.
Before the treaty's signing, the Soviet Union conducted negotiations with the United Kingdom and France regarding a potential "Tripartite" alliance. Long-running talks between the Soviet Union and Germany over a potential economic pact expanded to include the military and political discussions, culminating in the pact, along with a commercial agreement signed four days earlier.
Background.
After World War I.
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Bolshevist Russia ended its fight against the Central Powers, including Germany, in World War I by signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Therein, Russia agreed to cede sovereignty and influence over parts of several eastern European countries. Most of those countries became ostensible democratic republics following Germany's defeat and signing of an armistice in the autumn of 1918. With the exception of Belarus and Ukraine, those countries also became independent. However, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk lasted only eight and a half months, when Germany renounced it and broke off diplomatic relations with Russia.
Before World War I, Germany and Russia had long shared a trading relationship. Germany is a relatively small country with few natural resources. It lacks natural supplies of several key raw materials needed for economic and military operations. Since the late 19th century, it had relied heavily upon Russian imports of raw materials. Germany imported 1.5 billion Rechsmarks of raw materials and other goods annually from Russia before the war.
In 1922, the countries signed the Treaty of Rapallo, renouncing territorial and financial claims against each other. The countries pledged neutrality in the event of an attack against one another with the 1926 Treaty of Berlin. While imports of Soviet goods to Germany fell after World War I, after trade agreements signed between the two countries in the mid-1920s, trade had increased to 433 million Reichsmarks per year by 1927.
In the early 1930s, this relationship fell as the more isolationist Stalinist regime asserted power and the abandonment of post-World War I military control decreased Germany's reliance on Soviet imports, such that Soviet imports fell to 223 million Reichsmarks in 1934.
Mid-1930s.
In the mid-1930s, the Soviet Union made repeated efforts to reestablish closer contacts with Germany. The Soviet Union chiefly sought to repay debts from earlier trade with raw materials, while Germany sought to rearm, and the countries signed a credit agreement in 1935. The rise to power of the Nazi Party increased tensions between Germany, the Soviet Union and other countries with ethnic Slavs, which were considered "untermenschen" according to Nazi racial ideology. The Nazis were convinced that ethnic Slavs were incapable of forming their own state and, accordingly, must be ruled by others. Moreover, the anti-semitic Nazis associated ethnic Jews with both communism and international capitalism, both of which they opposed. Consequently, Nazis believed that Soviet untermenschen Slavs were being ruled by ""Jewish Bolshevik"" masters. Two primary goals of Nazism were to eliminate Jews and seek Lebensraum ("living space") for ethnic Aryans to the east. In 1934, Hitler spoke of an inescapable battle against "pan-Slav ideals", the victory in which would lead to "permanent mastery of the world", though he stated that they would "walk part of the road with the Russians, if that will help us."
Despite the political rhetoric, in 1936, the Soviets attempted to seek closer political ties to Germany along with an additional credit agreement, while Hitler rebuffed the advances, not wanting to seek closer political ties, even though a 1936 raw material crisis prompted Hitler to decree a Four Year Plan for rearmament "without regard to costs."
Tensions grew further after Germany and Fascist Italy supported the Fascist Spanish Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War in 1936, while the Soviets supported the partially socialist-led Spanish Republic opposition. In November 1936, Soviet-German relations sank further when Germany and Japan entered the Anti-Comintern Pact, which was purportedly directed against the Communist International, though it contained a secret agreement that either side would remain neutral if the other became involved with the Soviet Union. In November 1937, Italy also joined the Anti-Comintern Pact.
Late 1930s.
The Moscow Trials of the mid-1930s seriously undermined Soviet prestige in the West. Soviet purges in 1937 and 1938 made a deal less likely by disrupting the already confused Soviet administrative structure necessary for negotiations and giving Hitler the belief that the Soviets' were militarily weak.
The Soviets were not invited to the Munich Conference regarding Czechoslovakia . The Munich Agreement that followed marked the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1938 through a partial German annexation, part of an appeasement of Germany.
After German needs for military supplies after the Munich Agreement and Soviet demand for military machinery increased, talks between the two countries occurred from late 1938 to March 1939. The Soviet Third Five Year Plan would require massive new infusions of technology and industrial equipment. An autarkic economic approach or an alliance with England were impossible for Germany, such that closer relations with the Soviet Union were necessary, if not just for economic reasons alone. At that time, Germany could supply only 25 percent of its petroleum needs, and without its primary United States petroleum source in a war, would have to look to Russia and Romania. Germany suffered the same natural shortfall and supply problems for rubber and metal ores needed for hardened steel in war equipment , for which Germany relied on Soviet supplies or transit using Soviet rail lines. Finally, Germany also imported 40 per cent of its fat and oil food requirements, which would grow if Germany conquered nations that were also net food importers, and, thus, needed Soviet imports of Ukrainian grains or Soviet transshipments of Manchurian soybeans. Moreover, an anticipated British blockade in the event of war and a cutoff of petroleum from the United States would create massive shortages for Germany regarding a number of key raw materials
Following Hitler's March 1939 denunciation of the 1934 German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact, Britain and France had made statements guaranteeing the sovereignty of Poland, and on April 25, signed a Common Defense Pact with Poland, when that country refused to be associated with a four-power guarantee involving the USSR.
Initial talks.
Potential for Soviet-German talk expansion.
Germany and the Soviet Union discussed entering into an economic deal throughout early 1939. For months, Germany had secretly hinted to Soviet diplomats that it could offer better terms for a political agreement than could Britain and France. On March 10, Hitler in his official speech proclaimed that directly. That same day, Stalin, in a speech to the Eighteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, characterized western actions regarding Hitler as moving away from "collective security" and toward "nonintervention," with the goal being to direct Fascist aggression anywhere but against themselves. After the Congress concluded, the Soviet press mounted an attack on both France and Great Britain.
On April 7, a Soviet diplomat visited the German Foreign Ministry stating that there was no point in continuing the German-Soviet ideological struggle and that the countries could conduct a concerted policy. Ten days later, the Soviet ambassador met the German Deputy Foreign Minister and presented him a note requesting speedy removal of any obstacles for fulfillment of military contracts signed between Czechoslovakia and the USSR before the former was occupied by Germany. According to German accounts, at the end of the discussion, the ambassador stated "'there exists for Russia no reason why she should not live with us on a normal footing. And from normal the relations might become better and better." though other sources admit that it could be an exaggeration or inaccurate recounting of the ambassador's words. Immediately after that, the Soviet ambassador had been withdrawn to Moscow and never returned to Germany. According to Ulam, future conversations on the topic in Berlin were believed to continue with lower level officials working under the cover of a Soviet trade mission.
Tripartite talks begin.
Starting in mid-March 1939, the Soviet Union, Britain and France traded a flurry of suggestions and counterplans regarding a potential political and military agreement. The Soviet Union feared Western powers and the possibility of a "capitalist encirclements", had little faith either that war could be avoided or in the Polish army, and wanted guaranteed support for a two-pronged attack on Germany. Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided and that the Soviet Union, weakened by purges, could not serve as a main military participant. France, as a continental power, was more anxious for an agreement with the USSR than Britain, which was more willing to make concessions and more aware of the dangers of an agreement between the USSR and Germany. On April 17, Soviet foreign minister Maxim Litvinov outlined a French–British–Soviet mutual assistance pact between the three powers for five to 10 years, including military support, if any of the powers were the subject of aggression.
May changes.
Litvinov dismissal.
On May 3, Stalin replaced Foreign Minister Mazim Litinov with Vyacheslav Molotov, which significantly increased Stalin's freedom to maneuver in foreign policy. The dismissal of Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed disfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to "purge the ministry of Jews." Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create of an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany. Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's "modus operandi" was "more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan." But Stalin sent double message: Molotov appointed Solomon Lozovsky, a Jew, as one of his deputies.
May tripartite negotiations.
Although informal consultations started in late April, the main negotiations between the Soviet Union, Britain and France began in May. At a meeting in May 1939, the French Foreign Minister told the Soviet Ambassador to France that he was willing to support turning over all of eastern Poland to the Soviet Union, regardless of Polish opposition, if that was the price of an alliance with Moscow.
German supply concerns and potential political discussions.
In May, German war planners also became increasingly concerned that, without Russian supplies, Germany would need to find massive substitute quantities of 165,000 tons of manganese and almost 2 million tons of oil per year. In the context of further economic discussions, on May 17, the Soviet ambassador told a German official that he wanted to restate "in detail that there were no conflicts in foreign policy between Germany and Soviet Russia and that therefore there was no reason for any enmity between the two countries." Three days later, on May 20, Molotov told the German ambassador in Moscow that he no longer wanted to discuss only economic matters, and that it was necessary to establish a "political basis", which German officials saw an "implicit invitation."
On May 26, German officials feared a potential positive result to come from the Soviets talks regarding proposals by Britain and France. On May 30, fearing potential positive results from a British and French offer to the Soviets, Germany directed its diplomats in Moscow that "we have now decided to undertake definite negotiations with the Soviet Union." The ensuing discussions were channelled through the economic negotiation, because the economic needs of the two sides were substantial and because close military and diplomatic connections had been severed in the mid-1930s, leaving these talks as the only means of communication.
Baltic sticking point and German rapprochement.
Mixed signals.
The Soviets sent mixed signals thereafter. In his first main speech as Soviet Foreign Minister on May 31, Molotov criticized an Anglo-French proposal, stated that the Soviets did not "consider it necessary to renounce business relations with countries like Germany" and proposed to enter a wide-ranging mutual assistance pact against aggression. However, Soviet Commissar for Foreign Trade Mikoyan argued on June 2 to a German official that Moscow "had lost all interest in these negotiations' as a result of earlier German procrastination."
Tripartite talks progress and Baltic moves.
On June 2, the Soviet Union insisted that any mutual assistance pact should be accompanied by a military agreement describing in detail the military assistance that the Soviets, French and British would provide. That day, the Soviet Union also submitted a modification to a French and British proposal that specified the states that would be given aid in the event of "direct aggression", which included Belgium, Greece, Turkey, Romania, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Finland. Five days later, Estonia and Latvia signed non-aggression pacts with Germany, creating suspicions that Germany had ambitions in a region through which it could attack the Soviet Union.
British attempt to stop German armament.
On June 8, the Soviets had agreed that a high ranking German official could come to Moscow to continue the economic negotiations, which occurred in Moscow on July 3. Thereafter, official talks were started in Berlin on July 22.
Meanwhile, hoping to stop the German war machine, in July, Britain conducted talks with Germany regarding a potential plan to bail out the debt-ridden German economy, at the cost of one billion pounds, in exchange for Germany ending its armaments program. The British press broke a story on the talks, and Germany eventually rejected the offer.
Tripartite talks regarding "indirect aggression".
After weeks of political talks that began after the arrival of Central Department Foreign Office head William Strang, on July 8, the British and French submitted a proposed agreement, to which Molotov added a supplementary letter. Talks in late July stalled over a provision in Molotov's supplementary letter stating that a political turn to Germany by the Baltic states constituted "indirect aggression", which Britain feared might justify Soviet intervention in Finland and the Baltic states or push those countries to seek closer relations with Germany (while France was less resistant to the supplement). On July 23, France and Britain agreed with the Soviet proposal to draw up a military convention specifying a reaction to a German attack.
Soviet-German political negotiation beginnings.
Only July 18, Soviet trade representative Yevgeniy Barbarin visited Julius Schnurre, saying that the Soviets would like to extend and intensify German-Soviet relations. On July 25, the Soviet Union and Germany were very close to finalizing the terms of a proposed economic deal. On July 26, over dinner, the Soviets accepted a proposed three stage agenda which included the economic agenda first and "a new arrangement which took account of the vital political interests of both parties." On July 28, Molotov sent a first political instruction to the Soviet ambassador in Berlin that finally opened the door to a political detente with Germany.
Germany had learned about the military convention talks before the July 31 British announcement and were skeptical that the Soviets would reach a deal with Britain and France during those planned talks in August. On August 1, the Soviet ambassador stated that two conditions must be met before political negotiations could begin: a new economic treaty and the cessation of anti-Soviet attacks by German media, with which German officials immediately agreed. On August 2, Soviet political discussions with France and Britain were suspended when Molotov stated they could not be restarted until progress was made in the scheduled military talks.
Addressing past hostilities.
On August 3, German Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop told Soviet diplomats that "there was no problem between the Baltic and the Black Sea that could not be solved between the two of us." The Germans discussed prior hostility between the nations in the 1930s. They addressed the common ground of anti-capitalism, stating "there is one common element in the ideology of Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union: opposition to the capitalist democracies," "neither we nor Italy have anything in common with the capitalist west" and "it seems to us rather unnatural that a socialist state would stand on the side of the western democracies." They explained that their prior hostility toward Soviet Bolshevism had subsided with the changes in the Comintern and the Soviet renunciation of a world revolution. Astakhov characterized the conversation as "extremely important."
Final negotiations.
Finalizing the economic agreement.
In August, as Germany scheduled its invasion of Poland on August 25 and prepared for war with France, German war planners estimated that, with an expected British naval blockade, if the Soviet Union became hostile, Germany would fall short of their war mobilization requirements of oil, manganese, rubber and foodstuffs by huge margins. Every internal German military and economic study had argued that Germany was doomed to defeat without at least Soviet neutrality. On August 5, Soviet officials stated that the completion of the trading credit agreement was the most important stage that could be taken in the direction of further such talks.
By August 10, the countries worked out the last minor technical details to make all but final the their economic arrangement, but the Soviets delayed signing that agreement for almost ten days until they were sure that they had reached a political agreement with Germany. The Soviet ambassador explained to German officials that the Soviets had begun their British negotiations "without much enthusiasm" at a time when they felt Germany would not "come to an understanding", and the parallel talks with the British could not be simply broken off when they had been initiated after 'mature consideration.' On August 12, Germany received word that Molotov wished to further discuss these issues, including Poland, in Moscow.
Tripartite military talks begin.
The Soviets, British and French began military negotiations in August. They were delayed until August 12 because the British military delegation, which did not include Strang, took six days to make the trip traveling in a slow merchant ship, undermining the Soviets' confidence in British resolve. On August 14, the question of Poland was raised by Voroshilov for the first time, requesting that the British and French pressure the Poles to enter into an agreement allowing the Soviet army to be stationed in Poland. The Polish government feared that the Soviet government sought to annex disputed territories, the Eastern Borderlands, received by Poland in 1920 after the Treaty of Riga ending the Polish–Soviet War. The British and French contingent communicated the Soviet concern over Poland to their home offices and told the Soviet delegation that they could not answer this political matter without their governments' approval.
Meanwhile, Molotov spoke with Germany's Moscow ambassador on August 15 regarding the possibility of "settling by negotiation all outstanding problems of Soviet–German relations." The discussion included the possibility of a Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the fates of the Baltic states and potential improvements in Soviet-Japanese relations. Molotov stated that "should the German foreign minister come here" these issues "must be discussed in concrete terms." Within hours of receiving word of the meeting, Germany sent a reply stating that it was prepared to conclude a 25-year non-aggression pact, ready to "guarantee the Baltic States jointly with the Soviet Union", and ready to exert influence to improve Soviet-Japanese relations. The Soviets responded positively, but stated that a "special protocol" was required "defining the interests" of the parties. Germany replied that, in contrast to the British delegation in Moscow at that time without Strang, Ribbentrop personally would travel to Moscow to conclude a deal.
In the Soviet-British-French talks, the Anglo-Franco military negotiators were sent to discuss "general principles" rather than details. On August 15, the British contingent was instructed to move more quickly to bring the military talks to a conclusion, and thus, were permitted to give Soviet negotiators confidential British information. The British contingent stated that Britain currently only possessed six army divisions but, in the event of a war, they could employ 16 divisions initially, followed by a second contingent of 16 divisions—a sum far less than the 120 Soviet divisions. French negotiators stated that they had 110 divisions available. In discussions on August 18–19, the Poles informed the French ambassador that they would not approve Red Army troops operating in Poland.
Delayed commercial agreement signing.
After Soviet and German officials in Moscow first finalized the terms of a seven-year German-Soviet Commercial Agreement, German officials became nervous that the Soviets were delaying its signing on August 19 for political reasons. When Tass published a report that the Soviet-British-French talks had become snarled over the Far East and "entirely different matters", Germany took it as a signal that there was still time and hope to reach a Soviet-German deal. Hitler himself sent out a coded telegram to Stalin stating that because "Poland has become intolerable," Stalin must receive Ribbentrop in Moscow by August 23 at the latest to sign a Pact. Controversy surrounds a related alleged Stalin's speech on August 19, 1939 asserting that a great war between the Western powers was necessary for the spread of World Revolution. Historians debate whether that speech ever actually occurred.
At 2:00 a.m. on August 20, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a commercial agreement, dated August 19, providing for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials. The agreement covered "current" business, which entailed a Soviet obligation to deliver 180 million Reichsmarks in raw materials in response to German orders, while Germany would allow the Soviets to order 120 million Reichsmarks for German industrial goods. Under the agreement, Germany also granted the Soviet Union a merchandise credit of 200 million Reichsmarks over 7 years to buy German manufactured goods at an extremely favorable interest rate.
Soviets adjourn tripartite military talks and strike a deal with Germany.
After the Poles' resistance to pressure, on August 21, Voroshilov proposed adjournment of the military talks with the British and French, using the excuse that the absence of the senior Soviet personnel at the talks interfered with the autumn manoeuvres of the Soviet forces though the primary reason was the progress being made in the Soviet-German negotiations.
That same day, August 21, Stalin has received assurance would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would grant the Soviets land in Poland, the Baltic states, Finland and Romania. That night, with Germany nervously awaiting a response to Hitler's August 19 telegram, Stalin replied at 9:35 p.m. that the Soviets were willing to sign the pact and that he would receive Ribbentrop on August 23. The Pact was signed sometime in the night between August 23–24.
Pact signing.
On August 24, a 10-year non-aggression pact was signed with provisions that included: consultation; arbitration if either party disagreed; neutrality if either went to war against a third power; no membership of a group "which is directly or indirectly aimed at the other." Most notably, there was also a secret protocol to the pact, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet "spheres of influence".
Poland was to be partitioned in the event of its "political rearrangement". The USSR was promised an eastern part of Poland, primarily populated with Ukrainians and Belarusians, in case of its dissolution, and additionally Latvia, Estonia and Finland. Bessarabia, then part of Romania, was to be joined to the Moldovan ASSR, and become the Moldovan SSR under control of Moscow. The news was met with utter shock and surprise by government leaders and media worldwide, most of whom were aware only of the British-French-Soviet negotiations that had taken place for months.
Ribbentrop and Stalin enjoyed warm conversations at the signing, exchanging toasts and further discussing the prior hostilities between the countries in the 1930s. Ribbentrop stated that Britain had always attempted to disrupt Soviet-German relations, was "weak", and "wants to let others fight for her presumptuous claim to world dominion." Stalin concurred, adding "England dominated the world, that was due to the stupidity of the other countries that always let themselves be bluffed." Ribbentrop stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact was directed not against the Soviet Union, but against Western democracies, "frightened principally the City of London [i.e., the British financiers and the English shopkeepers" and stated that Berliners had joked that Stalin would yet joint the Anti-Comintern Pact himself. Stalin proposed a toast to Hitler, and Stalin and Molotov repeatedly toasted the German nation, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Soviet-German relations. Ribbentrop countered with a toast to Stalin and a toast the countries' relations. As Ribbentrop left, Stalin took him aside and stated that the Soviet Government took the new pact very seriously, and he would "guarantee his word of honor that the Soviet Union would not betray its partner."
Events during the Pact's operation.
Immediate dealings with Britain.
The day after the Pact was signed, the French and British military negotiation delegation urgently requested a meeting with Voroshilov. On August 25, Voroshilov told them "n view of the changed political situation, no useful purpose can be served in continuing the conversation." That day, Hitler told the British ambassador to Berlin that the pact with the Soviets prevented Germany from facing a two front war, changing the strategic situation from that in World War I, and that Britain should accept his demands regarding Poland. Surprising Hitler, Britain signed a mutual-assistance treaty with Poland that day, causing Hitler to delay the planned August 26 invasion of western Poland.
Division of eastern Europe.
On September 1, 1939, the German invasion of its agreed upon portion of western Poland started World War II. On September 17 the Red Army invaded eastern Poland and occupied the Polish territory assigned to it by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, followed by co-ordination with German forces in Poland. Eleven days later, the secret protocol of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was modified, allotting Germany a larger part of Poland, while ceding most of Lithuania to the Soviet Union.
After a Soviet attempt to invade Finland faced stiff resistance, the combatants signed an interim peace, granting the Soviets approximately 10 per cent of Finnish territory. The Soviet Union also sent troops into Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Thereafter, governments in all three Baltic countries requesting admission to the Soviet Union were installed.
Further dealings.
Germany and the Soviet Union entered an intricate trade pact on February 11, 1940 that was over four times larger than the one the two countries had signed in August 1939, providing for millions of tons of shipment to Germany of oil, foodstuffs and other key raw materials, in exchange for German war machines and other equipment. This was followed by a January 10, 1941 agreement setting several ongoing issues, including border specificity, ethnic migrations and further commercial deal expansion.
Discussions in the fall and winter of 1940-41 ensued regarding the potential entry of the Soviet Union as the fourth members of the Axis powers. The countries never came to an agreement on the issue.
Aftermath.
German invasion of the Soviet Union.
Nazi Germany terminated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with its invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa on June 22, 1941. After the launch of the invasion, the territories gained by the Soviet Union due to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact were lost in a matter of weeks. In the three weeks following the Pact's breaking, attempting to defend against large German advances, the Soviet Union suffered 750,000 casualties, and lost 10,000 tanks and 4,000 aircraft. Within six months, the Soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties and the Germans had captured three million Soviet prisoners, two million of which would die in German captivity by February 1942. German forces had advanced 1,050 miles (1,690 kilometers), and maintained a linearly-measured front of 1,900 miles (3,058 kilometers).
Post-war commentary regarding Pact negotiations.
The reasons behind signing the pact.
There is no consensus among historians regarding the reasons that prompted the Soviet Union to sign the pact with Nazi Germany. According to Ericson, the opinions "have ranged from seeing the Soviets as far-sighted anti-Nazis, to seeing them as reluctant appeasers, as cautious expansionists, or as active aggressors and blackmailers". Edward Hallett Carr argued that it was necessary to enter into a non-aggression pact to buy time, since the Soviet Union was not in a position to fight a war in 1939, and needed at least three years to prepare. He stated: "In return for non-intervention Stalin secured a breathing space of immunity from German attack." According to Carr, the "bastion" created by means of the Pact, "was and could only be, a line of defense against potential German attack." An important advantage (projected by Carr) was that "if Soviet Russia had eventually to fight Hitler, the Western Powers would already be involved." 
However, during the last decades, this view has been disputed. Historian Werner Maser stated that "the claim that the Soviet Union was at the time threatened by Hitler, as Stalin supposed...is a legend, to whose creators Stalin himself belonged." (Maser 1994: 64). In Maser's view (1994: 42), "neither Germany nor Japan were in a situation invading the USSR even with the least perspective [sic of success," and this could not have been unknown to Stalin.
Some critics, such as Viktor Suvorov, claim that Stalin's primary motive for signing the Soviet–German non-aggression treaty was Stalin's calculation that such a pact could result in a conflict between the capitalist countries of Western Europe. This idea is supported by Albert L. Weeks. However, other claims by Suvorov, such as the Stalin's planning to invade Germany in 1941, have remained under debate among historians, with some like David Glantz opposing, and others like Mikhail Meltyukhov supporting it.
The extent to which the Soviet Union's post-Pact territorial acquisitions may have contributed to preventing its fall (and thus a Nazi victory in the war) remains a factor in evaluating the Pact. Soviet sources point out that the German advance eventually stopped just a few kilometers away from Moscow, so the role of the extra territory might have been crucial in such a close call. Others postulate that Poland and the Baltic countries played the important role of buffer states between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and that the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was a precondition not only for Germany's invasion of Western Europe, but also for the Third Reich's invasion of the Soviet Union. The military aspect of moving from established fortified positions on the Stalin Line into undefended Polish territory could also be seen as one of the causes of rapid disintegration of Soviet armed forces in the border area during the German 1941 campaign, as the newly constructed Molotov Line was unfinished and unable to provide Soviet troops with the necessary defense capabilities.
Documentary evidence of early Soviet-German rapprochement.
In 1948, the U.S. State Department published a collection of documents recovered from the Foreign Office of Nazi Germany, This collection contains the German State Secretary's account on a meeting with Soviet ambassador Merekalov. This memorandum reproduces the following ambassador's statement: "'there exists for Russia no reason why she should not live with us on a normal footing. And from normal the relations might become better and better." According to Carr, this document is the first recorded Soviet step in the rapprochement with Germany. The next documentary evidence is the memorandum on the May 17 meeting between the Soviet ambassador and German Foreign Office official, where the ambassador "stated in detail that there were no conflicts in foreign policy between Germany and Soviet Russia and that therefore there was no reason for any enmity between the two countries." The third document is the summary of the May 20 meeting between Molotov and German ambassador von der Schulenburg. According to the document, Molotov told the German ambassador that he no longer wanted to discuss only economic matters, and that it was necessary to establish a "political basis", which German officials saw as an "implicit invitation." The last document is the German State Office memorandum on the telephone call made on June 17 by Bulgarian ambassador Draganov. In German accounts of Draganov's report, Astakhov explained that a Soviet deal with Germany better suited the Soviets than one with Britain and France, although from the Bulgarian ambassador it "could not be ascertained whether it had reflected the personal opinions of Herr Astakhov or the opinions of the Soviet Government".
This documentary evidence of an early Nazi-Soviet rapprochement were questioned by Geoffrey Roberts, who analyzed Soviet archival documents that had been de-classified and released on the eve of the 1990s. Roberts found no evidence that the alleged statements quoted by the Germans had ever been made in reality, and came to the conclusion that the German archival documents cannot serve as evidence for the existence of a dual policy during first half of 1939. According to him, no documentary evidence exists that the USSR responded to or made any overtures to the Germans "until the end of July 1939 at the earliest".
Litvinov's dismissal and Molotov's appointment.
Many historians note that the dismissal of Foreign Minister Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed a major obstacle to negotiations between them and the USSR.
Carr, however, has argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin’s way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a tough negotiator, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Albert Resis argued that the replacement of Litvinov by Molotov was both a warning to Britain and a signal to Germany. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could more easily negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British-French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.

Angeline series

The Angeline series is a series of three books, which are written by Louis Sachar, that revolves around two main characters. These people are Angeline Persopolis and Gary W. Boone. Angeline is an eight-year-old who gets sent to the sixth grade (In Someday Angeline) and is now a student at a boarding school (In Dog's don't tell jokes). The three books are called Someday Angeline (Released in 1983,) Dog's Don't tell jokes (Released in 1991,) and the third book, Super Weasel (Set to be Released in November 2009.)
The books.
Someday Angeline.
Angeline is extremely intelligent, because she knew things, especially related to fish and the ocean, "before she was born." Even though she is only eight, she is sent to the sixth grade. She wants to be a garbage collector like her father, although he wants her to become famous and is afraid of her intelligence at times. At school she also faces problems, bullied by the other students and misunderstood by her teacher, Mrs. Hardlick. Her only two friends are a fifth grade teacher, Miss Turbone (also known as Mr. Bone) and Gary Boone 
Mr. Persopolis wants the best for his daughter, and he often pushes her too hard to achieve. When she is elected Secretary of Trash, he becomes angry and orders her to resign. The next day at school, Mrs. Hardlick does not listen to Angeline when she tries to resign, and Angeline is so frustrated that she messes up the classroom, denouncing everything as "Garbage!" Mrs. Hardlick is furious and tells Angeline to not come back without a signed note from her father. For the next week she goes to the aquarium each day, instead of going to school. Her father gets home after she does, so he does not know.
When Miss Turbone finds out about this, she arranges to talk with Mr. Persopolis (it is implied that the two fall in love when they meet ). They decide Angeline will be transferred to Miss Turbone's fifth grade class, and that she will return to Mrs. Hardlick's class for a day or two while the transfer is arranged. They also plan to go on a date the next evening.
However, Mrs. Hardlick succeeds in alienating Angeline one more time, and she once more runs away from school, this time to the beach, where she jumps off the pier (the better to see the fish) and nearly drowns. However, she is saved by a fisherman and later gets completely better.
Dog's don't tell jokes.
Gary Boone or as his friends call him, "Goon" is a comedian. His school is having a talent competition and the grand prize is 100 dollars. Gary wants the prize, so he signs up.
He feels confident, until his realizes many other people signed up. His friends support him and helps him with his routine. Throughout the book, he is deciding whether or not he should compete.
Gary is very nervous on the night of the talent competition. He is last. When it is Gary's turn, he wets his pants due to his nervousness and excitement. He makes a mistake during the beginning, and soon he forgets his routine. Luckily, Gary's so called friends come and spray water and throw pies at him. This allows Gary to start over, not to mention earning a few laughs. His comic routine runs smoothly and he manages to surprise the audience by showing them his newly shaved head. Gary wins $100 and is respected by his classmates.

Indian Camp

"Indian Camp" is a short story written by Ernest Hemingway. The story was first published in 1924 in Ford Madox Ford's literary magazine "Transatlantic Review" in Paris and republished by Boni & Liveright in Hemingway's first American volume of short stories "In Our Time" (1925). The first of Hemingway's stories to feature the semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams—a child in this story—"Indian Camp" is told from his point of view.
In the story Nick Adams' father, a country doctor, has been summoned to a Native American or "Indian" camp to deliver a pregnant woman of her baby. At the camp, the father is forced to perform an emergency caesarean section using a jack-knife, with Nick as his assistant. Afterward, the woman's husband is discovered dead, having slit his throat during the operation. The story shows the emergence of Hemingway's understated style and his use of counterpoint. An initiation story, "Indian Camp" includes themes such as childbirth and fear of death which permeate much of Hemingway's subsequent work. When the story was published, the quality of writing was noted and praised, and scholars consider "Indian Camp" an important story in the Hemingway canon.
Plot summary.
The story begins in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby for a woman who has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a caesarian operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father why the woman's husband killed himself, and silently tells himself that he will never die.
Background and publication history.
In the early 1920s, Hemingway and his wife Hadley lived in Paris where he was foreign correspondent for the "Toronto Star". When Hadley became pregnant they returned to Toronto. Hemingway biographer Kenneth Lynn suggests that Hadley's childbirth became the inspiration for the story. She went into labor while Hemingway was on a train, returning from New York. Lynn believes Hemingway likely was terrified Hadley would not survive the birth, and he became "beside himself with fear ... about the extent of her suffering and swamped by a sense of helplessness at the realization that he would probably arrive too late to be of assistance to her". Hemingway wrote "Indian Camp" a few months after John Hemingway was born in Toronto on October 10, 1923.
While they were in Toronto, Hemingway's first book, "Three Stories and Ten Poems", was published in Paris, followed months later by a second volume, "in our time" (without capitals), which included 18 short vignettes presented as untitled chapters. Hemingway, Hadley, and their son (nicknamed Bumby) returned to Paris in January 1924, moving into a new apartment on the Rue Notre Dame des Champs. With Ezra Pound, Hemingway helped Ford Madox Ford edit his newly launched literary magazine, "Transatlantic Review", which published pieces by modernists such as Pound, John Dos Passos, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, as well as Hemingway.
"Indian Camp" began as a 29-page untitled manuscript that Hemingway cut to seven pages; at first he called the story "One Night Last Summer". In 1924, the seven-page story titled "Indian Camp" was published by the "Transatlantic Review" in the "Works in Progress" section, along with a piece from James Joyce's manuscript "Finnegans Wake". A year later on October 5, 1925, "Indian Camp" was republished by Boni & Liveright in New York, in an expanded American edition of Hemingway's first collection of short stories titled "In Our Time", (with capitals) with a print-run of 1335 copies.
"Indian Camp" was later included in Hemingway's collection "The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories" published in October 1938. Two collections of short stories published after Hemingway's death included "Indian Camp": "The Nick Adams Stories" (1972) and "The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vigía Edition" (1987). "The Nick Adams Stories" (1972), edited by Philip Young, included the story fragment titled "Three Shots" that Hemingway originally cut from "Indian Camp".
Themes and genre.
Initiation and fear of death.
"Indian Camp" is an initiation story. Nick's father (Dr. Adams) exposes his young son to childbirth and, unintentionally, to violent death—an experience that causes Nick to equate childbirth with death. Hemingway critic Wendolyn Tetlow maintains that in "Indian Camp", sexuality culminates in "butchery-style" birth and bloody death, and that Nick's anxiety is obvious when he turns away from the butchery. The story reaches a climax when Nick's "heightened awareness" of evil causes him to turn away from the experience. Although Nick may not want to watch the caesarian, his father insists he watch - he does not want his son to be initiated into an adult world without toughness, writes Thomas Strychacz.
Hemingway biographer Philip Young writes that Hemingway's emphasis in "Indian Camp" was not primarily on the woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on young Nick Adams, who witnesses these events and becomes a "badly scarred and nervous young man". In "Indian Camp", Hemingway begins the events that shape the Adams persona. Young considers this single Hemingway story to hold the "master key" to "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career". Critic Howard Hannum agrees. He believes the trauma of birth and suicide Hemingway paints in "Indian Camp" rendered a leitmotif that gave Hemingway a unified framework for the Nick Adams stories.
"Indian Camp" is also about the fear of death. The section cut from the story highlights Nick's fear; the published version underscores it in a less obvious manner. In the cut section, later published as "Three Shots", the night before being taken to the Indian camp Nick is left alone in the forest, where he is "overwhelmed by thoughts of death". Critic Paul Strong speculates that Hemingway may have intended the narrative to be structured so that Nick's father chose to take his fearful son to the Indian camp where Nick faced the grisly reality of death, which can have done "little to assuage Nick's fears." Hannum believes Hemingway is intentionally vague about the details of the birth but not the death; he speculates that Nick would have likely "blocked out much of the caesarian but he had clearly seen the father's head tilted back".
Critics have questioned why the woman's husband kills himself. Strong finds the arguments that the husband is driven to suicide by the wife's screaming to be problematic because the suicide occurs at the moment the screams are silenced. He points to Hemingway's statement in "Death in the Afternoon", "if two people love each other there can be no happy end to it", as evidence that the husband may have killed himself because he is "driven frantic by his wife's pain, and perhaps his own".
The story also shows the innocence of childhood; Nick Adams believes he will live forever and be a child forever; he is a character who sees his life "stretching ahead." At the end of the story, in the boat with his father, Nick denies death when he says he will never die. "Indian Camp" shows Hemingway's early fascination with suicide and with the conflict between fathers and sons. Young thinks there is an unavoidable focus on the fact that the two people the principal characters are based on—the father, Clarence Hemingway, and the boy, Ernest Hemingway—end up committing suicide. Kenneth Lynn writes that the irony to modern readers is that both characters in "that boat on the lake would one day do away with themselves". Hemingway shot himself on July 2, 1961; his father shot himself on December 6, 1928.
Primitivism, race, and autobiography.
In his essay "Hemingway's Primitivism and 'Indian camp
According to Hemingway scholar Thomas Strychacz, in the story Hemingway presents a re-enactment of the arrival of Europeans in the New World and the subsequent doctrine of manifest destiny. The white men in the story arrive on the water and are met at a beach by natives. The native husband and father of the baby loses everything, causing him to kill himself: his home is overtaken, and his wife ripped apart. The white doctor tells his son to ignore the woman's screams: "her screams are not important. I don't hear them because they are not important." The doctor's victory is to control nature by delivering a baby, diminished by the father's suicide who through his death symbolically takes back control from the white doctor.
Meyers claims the story is not autobiographical though it is an early example of Hemingway's ability to tell stories "true to life." In the story, Nick Adams' father, who is portrayed as "professionally cool", is based on Hemingway's own father, Clarence Hemingway. Hemingway's paternal uncle, George, appears in the story, and is treated unsympathetically. Hannum suggests George may have been the child's father, writing that in the story remains the "never-resolved implication of the paternity of the Indian child". During the surgery the mother bites Uncle George, the Indians laugh at him, and he leaves when the father is found dead.
Jackson Benson writes in "Ernest Hemingway: The Life as Fiction and the Fiction as Life" that critics should refrain from finding connections between Hemingway's life and fiction and instead focus on how he uses biographical events to transform life into art. He believes the events in a writer's life have only a vague relationship to the fiction, like a dream from which a drama emerges. Of Hemingway's earliest stories, Benson claims "his early fiction, his best, has often been compared to a compulsive nightmare". In his essay "On Writing", Hemingway wrote that "Indian Camp" was a story in which imaginary events were made to seem real: "Everything good he'd ever written he'd made up ... Of course he'd never seen an Indian woman having a baby. That was what made it good."
Writing style.
Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker writes that Hemingway learned from his short stories how to "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". The style has become known as the iceberg theory, because, as Baker describes it, in Hemingway's writing the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices to write about life in general—not only his life. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface.
Hemingway learned from Ezra Pound how to achieve a stripped-down style and how to incorporate the concepts of imagism in his prose. He said Pound "had taught him more 'about how to write and how not to write' than any son of a bitch alive"; and his friend James Joyce told him "to pare down his work to the essentials". The prose is spare and lacks a clear symbolism. Instead of more conventional literary allusions, Hemingway relied on repetitive metaphors or metonymy to build images. The caesarian is repeatedly associated with words such as "the blanket" and "the bunk" in a series of objective correlatives, a technique Hemingway may have learned from T.S. Eliot. Tetlow believes in this early story Hemingway ignored character development; he simply places a character in a setting, and adds descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound, which give a sense of truth.
"Indian Camp" is constructed in three parts: the first places Nick and his father on a dark lake; the second takes place in the squalid and cramped cabin amid terrifying action; and the third shows Nick and his father back on the lake—bathed in sunlight. Hemingway's use of counterpoint is evident when, for example, at the end, Nick trails his hand in lake water that "felt warm in the sharp chill of the morning". Paul Strong believes the deleted section may have provided context and additional counterpoint to the plot, with Nick's aloneness in the "stillness of the night" juxtaposed against the middle scene, crowded with people. Paul Smith writes that by cutting the piece, Hemingway focuses on the story's central point: the life and death initiation rituals, familiar to the residents of the Indian camp but alien to young Nick. Unable to express his feelings fully, in the end, Nick trails his hand in the water and "felt quite sure that he would never die".
Reception and legacy.
Hemingway's writing style attracted attention when "in our time" (without capitals) was published in Paris in 1924—in a small-print run from Ezra Pound's modernist series through Three Mountains Press. Edmund Wilson described the writing as "of the first distinction", enough to bring attention to Hemingway. When "Indian Camp" was published, it received considerable praise. Ford Madox Ford regarded "Indian Camp" as an important early story by a young writer. Critics in the United States claimed Hemingway reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style. Hemingway admits "In Our Time" is a collection of stories with "pretty good unity" and generally critics agree.
In the 1970s Carlos Baker wrote of the stories from "In Our Time", and specifically "Indian Camp", that they were a remarkable achievement. Hemingway scholars, such as Benson, rank "Indian Camp" as one of Hemingway's "greatest short stories," a story that is described as "best known", "violent" and "dramatic". In 1992, Frederick Busch wrote in "The New York Times" that Hemingway had gone out of fashion. While his antisemitism, racism, violence, and attitudes toward women and homosexuals made him a politically incorrect writer, he turned violence into art unlike any other American writer of his time by showing that "the making of art is a matter of life or death, no less". Busch believes Hemingway's characters either faced life or chose death, a choice shown most starkly in "Indian Camp". The saving of a life in "Indian Camp" is at the center of much of Hemingway's fiction, Busch writes, and adds power to his fiction.

R U Professional

"R U Professional" is a song by the indie rock band The Mae Shi, inspired by the audio of a July 2008 outburst of actor Christian Bale on the set of "Terminator Salvation". The song was written and released by the group twenty-four hours after the February 2, 2009 appearance of the Bale outburst on the internet. In a statement released from The Mae Shi, the group explained that the audio from the Bale outburst "was so crazy" that they were inspired to record a song about it, further stating "it's a tribute song we made to celebrate the epic-ness of Christian Bale". The piece was made available on YouTube and via download on MediaFire on February 3, 2009.
The song has received generally positive reception. "MTV.com" characterized it as "a Devo-esque slice of new wave fun", and "Dose" called it an "electro jam". Geoff Boucher of the "Los Angeles Times" called it "a jaunty pop ode to Bale". Music sites including Pitchfork Media were impressed with the group's ability to write, record and release the video within twenty-four hours after the audio of the Bale outburst appeared on the internet.
Background.
While Christian Bale was acting in a scene for the film "Terminator Salvation" with actress Bryce Dallas Howard, Bale yelled at the film's director of photography, Shane Hurlbut, for walking into his line of sight. During the four-minute audio recording, Bale can be heard screaming obscenities at Hurlbut and threatening to quit the film if Hurlbut did it again and was not fired. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.
The incident occurred in July 2008 during shooting for the film in New Mexico, and an audio recording of Bale yelling at Hurlbut appeared on the website TMZ.com on February 2, 2009. Prior to releasing the audio on the internet, TMZ.com had reported on the incident on their website in July 2008. TMZ.com reported that film executives for "Terminator Salvation" sent a copy of the audio recording to the film's insurance company, in case Bale did quit the film.
In a statement to Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM on February 6, 2009, Bale said he "acted like a punk", and that he and Hurlbut talked after the incident and "resolved this completely". Bale acknowledged the two worked together for several hours after the incident, and "at least a month after that", and noted "I've seen a rough cut of the movie and he has done a wonderful job. It looks fantastic".
Inspiration and release.
A statement released by The Mae Shi explained the group's inspiration to write the song: "We thought it tape was so crazy that we, The Mae Shi, wrote and recorded a song about it. We should clarify and say that this isn't really a Mae Shi song, it's a tribute song we made to celebrate the epic-ness of Christian Bale." Band drummer Brad Breeck commented in an interview, "It was a late-night, spur-of-the-moment experiment. We heard the Bale thing, wrote and recorded a song in about two hours, posted it to the Internet. That’s it!"
The lyrics of the song include references to films Bale has appeared in including "Newsies", "Swing Kids", and "American Psycho". The song begins with the phrase, "He is the Dark Knight, he is professional." The chorus of the song is "Oh, whoo wow/ He is professional/ But I think he's lost control", and the lyrics include: "Swing Kid with a violent streak", "Step back, stay out of his light/Better not try to put up a fight/Newsies will get you tonight/'Cause they're professional!", and "Don't look too deep in his eyes/he can't hide what's inside of his mind/and it might get a little bit ugly/and you might meet an American Psycho". The piece incorporates audio clips from Bale's outburst. The song was made available for listening on YouTube or via download on MediaFire on February 3, 2009. The video description on YouTube by the group stated, "Song By The Mae Shi celebrating the life and work of Xtian Bale. Bale's performance as John Connor in the upcoming Terminator 4 'Redemption' Film will no doubt be one of the greatest of all time. He will win every Oscar for his performance, even the special effects and animation ones."
Reception.
Gil Kaufman of "MTV.com" characterized the song as "a Devo-esque slice of new wave fun". Leah Collins of "Dose" magazine commented "L.A.'s The Mae Shi take things to another level, not just sampling Bale but turning around an electro jam, 'R U Professional'". Geoff Boucher of the "Los Angeles Times" called the piece "a jaunty pop ode to Bale". Whitney Matheson of "USA Today" called the song "a danceable and inspired track", and commented "I smell a hit."
Darryl Sterdan of "The Toronto Sun" commented about the remixes which appeared after the Bale rant, "Here's one of the first, and one of the best: A danceable little electro-pop ditty from L.A.'s Mae Shi, complete with original lyrics and peppered with snippet's from Bale's rant. What else can you say but: Oh, good for you!" "New Musical Express" recommended the piece, and described it as "an electro-rock song ... sampling Bale". Kevin Harley of "The Independent" reported that the ban would appear at a music festival, "The Fans Strike Back", and commented that they "must play their Christian Bale mash-up. They are professional, yes?" Derek Bledsoe of "Boing Boing" called the song "a tasty Christian Bale tribute".
Genevieve Koski of "The A.V. Club" called the piece "a hastily written, but pretty amusing, original song". Rhodri Marsden of the "Irish Independent" commented "one suspects it was a pre-existing tune hastily adapted" for the Bale outburst. Matt Fernandes of the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" described the piece as a "new wave ditty using the jerkiest clips of Bale's on-set rant", and commented "The results are pretty funny." "El País" described the piece as an electropop song that contributed to the viral spread of the Christian Bale rant after its release on the Internet. "C7nema" commented on the fallout from the actor's rant, "The furor was such that even the band "The Mae Shi" made a hilarious song called 'R U Professional' dedicated to the madness of Bale.
Kristin Hunt of "The Celebrity Cafe" wrote that the piece "gets my vote for best Bale parody", and commented that in her view it was better than "Bale Out" by RevoLucian. "Chicagoist" wrote that the song by The Mae Shi was their favorite of the Christian Bale remixes, commenting "There are lots of remixes floating around there but this track by The Mae Shi is our current favorite treatment." Mark Richardson of "Pitchfork Media" was impressed that "R U Professional" was compiled in twenty-four hours, noting "Props for putting it all together in a day". Mark Lore of "Chico News & Review" called the piece "a loving nod to the prima donna rant of Christian Bale".

Kampung Tersusun Kampung Pulai

Kampung Tersusun Kampung Pulai is a Bumiputra neighborhood located near the town of Gopeng, Perak. It is situated along the prominent Jalan Gopeng, just opposite of Kopisan in the western side and the north of Taman Gopeng Baru and the north of Gunung Mesah. 
People.
This is one of dozens of villages under the Mukim Teja administration which has among the highest concentration of Rao people (Urang Rao), everybody here speaks the Rao Dialect, a dialect in relation with both Minang and Melayu Language.
There are approximately 492 permanent residents live here and the number tripled during weekends and particularly holidays such as the major Muslim celebrations, people from the cities particularly Kuala Lumpur and Penang will flocked back here to join their families celebrating the occasions.
Residents comprises from various background such as engineers, doctors, teachers, electrical technicians, factory workers, bankers and a vast majority working as government servants as well as the private sectors. Almost half of the residents are senior citizens while the rest are youngsters and their children. Many of the younger generations migrated to the larger Ipoh city, Kuala Lumpur and Penang.
Neighborhood layout.
There are two very significant part of this village, the uphill compound Ateh, the lowland compound Bawah and the new south compound Sri Wangi, previously known as Ateh Ompang. These terms were given by the residents themselves to ease the recognition of houses in which the whole village is geographically designed with different altitude. Therefore it is easier for the residents to recognize the houses through the terms such as Kampung Ateh or Kampung Atas upper side, Kampung Bawah lower side and Ateh Ompang banks. The east side of Kampung Bawah were once known as Telago Jaoh but the term usage subsided among the new generations but it is popular among the senior citizens. 
The Kampung Ateh was designed with a very easy layout, two very long street on each side and several alleys to segregate the clusters, apparently, it is the grid iron layout with the first row of houses facing the large Jalan Gopeng the west while the other row is facing the east, towards the Titiwangsa mountain range and a very large old tin mine lake. Kampung Ateh was known to be the houses made of bricks instead of woods. These houses were largely designed partly bricks or a whole brick house. Most of the residents affiliate the Kampung Ateh people with "rumah batu" or houses made of bricks.
There is a large multipurpose hall located at the very center of Kampung Tersusun Kampung Pulai. A lot of activities were held there such as weddings, talks, and even served as the voting center for the previous general election. Most of the times, the hall was used for residents to play badminton in weekends and almost every nights on weekdays.
Education.
Children attend schooling in various school but mostly prefer to study in the nearby primary and secondary schools. There is no bus or any means of transportation service provided for the school children because traditionally, parents or family members will send their children to the schools themselves, usually early morning the morning session and the afternoon the evening session. Some of the school children even prefer to walk and cycle to their schools because it is just across the street. A pedestrian bridge was built to join Kampung Kopisan Baru and Kampung Tersusun Kampung Pulai to ease the travel between these two neighborhood, therefore people don't have to risk their lives crossing the busy Jalan Gopeng.
Facilities.
Kampung Pulai Multipurpose Hall or Dewan Serbaguna Kampong Pulai is located at the very centre of the village for weddings, forums, elections and even night time badminton tournaments. This was the previous location of the original Kampong Pulai Stage which was demolished due to its severe damage. 
Madrasah Ihsaniah is the only religious center for the locals and everything regarding public consent mostly held here. There is a custom whenever somebody had died, the Ketok (Kowtouwk) will be sounded.

The End of Something

"The End of Something" is a short story written by Ernest Hemingway, published in 1925 in his collection of short stories "In Our Time".
Publication history.
According to notes on the manuscript, Hemingway wrote “The End of Something” in March 1924. Paul Smith claimed that based on the different kinds of paper used for the manuscript, it is possible that the story had “an earlier start”. “The End of Something” was published in 1925 in Hemingway’s first collection of short stories, "In Our Time". In May 1925, F. Scott Fitzgerald reviewed "In Our Time" for Bookman, and called “The End of Something” “something fundamentally new.” Critics received the entire collection well, and “The End of Something” has been called a “harbinger of stories to come” because of its plot involving a man choosing the companionship of another man over the companionship of a woman, which became a common theme in Hemingway’s stories.
Synopsis.
“The End of Something” begins with a description of Horton Bay, Michigan, a town that exists because of the lumber industry. Once the logs disappear, the lumber mill does, too, taking away “everything that had made… Hortons Bay a town.” By the time of the story, the town is deserted, and only the white limestone foundation of the mill is left.
In this setting, Nick Adams and Marjorie, two teenagers in a relationship, fish in a small boat. While Marjorie daydreams that the remains of the mill are like a castle, Nick expresses his frustration over their unsuccessful fishing. The two then set up long lines and fish from the shore. 
Sitting by a driftwood fire the pair made, Marjorie asks Nick what is bothering him, and Nick expresses that “It isn’t fun anymore.” Marjorie recognizes his words as the end of the relationship and leaves, while Nick lies face down on a blanket. When Nick’s friend Bill arrives to ask how the breakup went, he proves that Nick had previously planned the breakup. When Nick yells at Bill to go away, however, Nick shows dissatisfaction with his decision.
Autobiographical elements.
Many literary analysts have noted the connection of “The End of Something” to events in Hemingway’s life. In "Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story", Baker notes that Hemingway had “a brief romance with Marjorie Bump, at Horton Bay in the summer of 1919.” H.R. Stoneback provided an explanation for the autobiographical elements of the story in his essay “'Nothing was ever lost': Another Look at 'That Marge Business'". Stoneback claimed that “Marge and Hemingway met long before the summer of 1919.” According to Stoneback, Marjorie came to Horton Bay to visit her uncle, Professor Ernest L. Ohle of Washington University of St. Louis, who had his summer cottage there.” William Ohle in How it was in Horton Bay explained that Hemingway and Marge met in 1915 when Marge “was walking back from the creek to her uncle’s house, a speckled trouth on a stringer in one hand and a long cane pole in the other.” Bernice Kert described Marge as “softly vulnerable and good-natured, the right degree of woman for Ernest.” Stoneback disdained such quaint descriptions of the real-life Marjorie. He claimed that the “competence, skill, discipline, humility, pride, and poise” shown by Marge in the story reflected the Marjorie Hemingway knew.
Analysis.
Most readers agree the opening description "represents a vivid (if disturbing) metaphor for the relationship Nick and Marjorie share.” Analysts like Paul Smith claimed that the use of a descriptive and symbolic introduction is rather common in writing, but this does not reduce the introduction's usefulness in conveying the state of Marjorie and Nick's relationship at the beginning of the story. In “False Wilderness”, Frederic Svoboda emphasized the significance of the description of the old lumber town when he explained that “Horton Bay in Hemingway’s time was hardly the ghost town of "The End of Something." While the lumber mills indeed had moved away… the village was not abandoned. It was rather a small summer resort.” We can conclude from Svoboda’s research that Hemingway was not simply representing Horton Bay as he remembered it, but instead making a distinct choice to create a setting representative of the plot of the story. Laura Gruber Godfrey agreed that “The End of Something” shows “the careful interweaving of human characters with their communities and their landscapes.” In losing the mill, the town lost the linchpin that held it together, so when Nick and Marjorie row by ten years later, “there was nothing of the mill left except the broken white limestone of its foundations.” The mill was once something, like the relationship of Nick and Marjorie, but, as reflected in the title of the short story, time and change has reduced it to brokenness. 
Lisa Turner took the comparison even further in claiming that Hemingway parallels Nick’s behavior towards Marjorie with loggers’ treatment of the forests of Michigan, so that “Nick, like the loggers, is all too aware of the damage he is doing,” but he has simply ignored the harm he causes Marjorie until it is too late. Turner argued that “Hemingway uses the imagery of an irreparably damaged environment in “The End of Something” and elsewhere throughout the stories of "In Our Time" to link violence against nature with other forms of violence depicted in that collection, including violence against… women,… suggesting that he was more ecofeminist in his sympathies that his readers have yet acknowledged.” While many view Turner's argument as rather radical, she was correct that the environment surrounding Nick and Marjorie represents their relationship.
As the story moves into dialogue between Nick and Marjorie, Marjorie begins to prove her emotional maturity. Nick merely complains about the fish and resists any conversation outside of what is necessary for their fishing. By avoiding conversation, Nick acknowledges that something is wrong, but he does not communicate it with Marjorie. Showing both her knowledge of Nick and her maturity, Marjorie recognizes the tension when she asks, “What’s the matter, Nick?” When Nick avoids the question, she asks again, “What’s really the matter?” (Hemingway, 81) According to Turner, Marjorie’s questioning proves her “sensitivity to Nick’s emotional state.” She understands Nick, and in her questioning, she gives Nick a chance to express his problems. As exhibited in her understanding, Marjorie could help Nick with the emotional struggles he is facing, but he resists her because he simply does not know what he wants ("everything was gone to hell inside of me"). In his refusal to communicate even when Marjorie encourages him, Nick shows his emotional immaturity.
When Nick expresses the frustrations he has with the relationship, he shows his own emotional immaturity, but his failures give Marjorie an opportunity to show her responsibility and sensibleness. Nick declares to Marjorie that “You know everything. That’s the trouble.” The claim is false, at least in relation to Marjorie’s outdoor skills, since Nick has to explain to Marjorie how to properly gut a fish, telling her that “You don’t want to take the ventral fin out” It is, however, an accurate description of Marjorie’s maturity. When she recognizes Nick’s unhappiness, she questions him about it. She refuses to ignore and overlook difficult problems. Instead, she confronts them in order to find solutions. When Nick expresses his dissatisfaction with the relationship, instead of drawing out the conversation or pleading with Nick to reconsider, she declares “I’m going to take the boat.” When Nick offers to push it off for her, she informs him that “You don’t need to.” Marjorie handles the situation calmly and maturely, especially in comparison to the emotionally stricken Nick who has his head in his hands. Once she is aware of Nick’s feelings, she makes a rational decision and leaves. She even asserts her independence and her by rejecting Nick’s offer to assist her. She is capable, strong, and far more serene than Nick. H.R. Stoneback claims that Marjorie’s handling of the entire situation shows “competence, skill, discipline, humility, pride, and poise.” Perhaps Nick is right that “It isn’t fun any more. Not any of it.” Perhaps Marjorie has outgrown him, and he is not ready to move from being playful and young to making a commitment and solving difficult problems. 
Nick’s incapacity to acknowledge difficult problems plays a significant role in the end of the relationship, but in the final sentences, Hemingway reveals the breakup might have been encouraged by Bill. Based on the “Three Day Blow,” Bill had supported Nick's decision to end things with Marjorie because of differences in class and because women “ruin you”. Some analysts, like Gerry Brenner, interpret the Bill interlude as expressing Hemingway's “latent homoeroticism.” According to Smith, such an argument explores how Nick and Marjorie sat on the blanket “without touching each other,” and afterwards how Nick notices that “Bill didn’t touch him, either.” By adding “either” to the end of the second phrase, Hemingway definitely intended to connect the two, but most literary analysts believe that the lines do not express Nick’s unfulfilled romantic desire for Bill, as there is little other evidence to support such an argument. Instead, the lines show an isolation of Nick from the rest of humanity. Stoneback claims that the theme of “touch and being touched” runs throughout In Our Time, with a culmination of the theme in "Big Two-Hearted River", when Nick reaches a place where “Nothing could touch him.” This corresponds with the emotional angst Nick expresses with his revelation that “I feel as though everything was gone to hell inside of me.” Smith takes a different route from Stoneback in claiming that Bill and Marjorie are “disembodied representations of a conflict within [Nick’s] mind,” but his analysis is also consistent with Nick’s expression of his inner hell.

Philadelphia Experiment II

Philadelphia Experiment II (also known as The Philadelphia Experiment II, The Philadelphia Experiment 2, or Philadelphia Experiment 2) is a 1993 science fiction film. It is the sequel to the 1984 film "The Philadelphia Experiment", but has none of the same cast or crew and only two of the same characters. It stars Brad Johnson as David Herdeg (the hero from the first film) and Gerrit Graham as the villain who meets an untimely end.
Plot.
It is nine years after the events of the first movie, and David Herdeg (the survivor of the Philadelphia Experiment) and Allison (the woman from 1984) have married and have a child. One day David awakes in agony, to a changed world in which Germany won World War II and the United States are about to mark 50 years as a Nazi conquest. America is under authoritarian rule, with its citizens surviving under an oppressive dictatorship.
In this alternative timeline, Germany won the war because it had a futuristic aircraft called the "Phoenix", to deliver atomic bombs, destroying Washington, D.C., and other major targets on the east coast. The United States became demoralized and eventually surrendered to Nazi Germany. The Phoenix was destroyed in the explosion and Friedrich Mahler, the scientist who took credit for building it, was ridiculed since he was unable to reproduce "his" successful design.
The aircraft was actually a stealth F-117 Nighthawk—accidentally sent back in time in an experiment. Mahler's son, engineer William Mailer, was working on a teleportation system using technology similar to the Philadelphia Experiment. The concept was to "beam" a bomber into a high-risk area to surprise enemy air defenses, attack and escape before they could react.
The first test of the device was to transport an F-117 with a payload of nuclear weapons to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. While the aircraft was successfully teleported to Ramstein, it was also transferred through time, arriving in 1943 Nazi Germany (the US pilot's fate is unknown). Mahler finds it and tells the Nazis that it is his invention.
Because of Herdeg's unique blood, he is recruited by Mailer to travel through time successfully and prevent the alteration to the timeline. Herdeg is warped back to the night before the F-117 (now repainted in Luftwaffe colors) launches to attack Washington and successfully destroys the aircraft. Mahler is killed and his son, Mailer, is erased from the timeline. Since he was never born, the grandfather paradox erases the aircraft teleportation project from existence and restores the timeline to normal.
Language note.
At a crucial moment in 1943 Germany, Mailer has a conversation in German—without subtitles—with Mahler. Mailer tries to explain, in faltering German, that he is Mahler's son and that he needs to tell him what happened to the aircraft during the bombing run. Mahler responds in German that "he has no son". Once Mahler is shot and killed, Mailer ceases to exist.

Bunnag family

The House of Bunnag (; ) was a powerful Siamese noble family of Persian descent of the early Rattanakosin Kingdom of Siam. By the nineteenth century, its power and influence reached its zenith. The family was favored by Chakri monarchs and monopolized high-ranking titles. Three of the four "Somdet Chao Phraya" came from the Bunnag family — Dis, styled Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Prayurawongse; his younger brother Tat, styled Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Pichaiyat; the eldest son Chuang, styled Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Si Suriyawongse. They played key roles in government and foreign relations until after the Front Palace Crisis. As Chulalongkorn sought to undo the power of nobility and pursue centralization, the Bunnags gradually withdrew from prominent roles in Siamese politics but continued to fill important official ranks.
History.
Sheikh Ahmad.
Sheikh Ahmad, a Persian merchant, along with his brother Muhamad Sa-id and subordinates, settled in Siam around 1600. Sheikh Ahmad was a native of Qom in Safavid Iran, south of Tehran. He established himself as a rich merchant in Ayutthaya. There he entered the service of King Songtham (1611–1628) who appointed him as Chao Krom Tha Khwa (; Lord of the Right Pier) to supervise traders from the West, i.e. Persians, Indians and Europeans. He was also appointed "Chularatchamontri" (จุฬาราชมนตรี; Minister of Islamic affairs) to oversee all Shiites in Siam.
After subjugating a Japanese revolt under Yamada Nagamasa, Sheikh Ahmad became "Samuha Nayok" (First Prime Minister). Descendants of Sheikh Ahmad exerted control over Siamese politics, trade, and foreign affairs. Many of them became "Samuha Nayok". They also monopolized the post of Chularachamontri. Some of them even converted to Buddhism.
Settlement in Thonburi.
A man called Bunnag was a Buddhist descendant of Sheikh Ahmad. Bunnag married the sister of Nak, who was the wife of Thong Duang. He was then kinsmen to Thong Duang. Though Thong Duang emerged as a powerful noble in Thonburi, Bunnag stayed far from the bureaucracy due to his childhood conflicts with Taksin.
Thong Duang then became Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, the first king of the Chakri dynasty in 1782. During the Nine Armies War, Bunnag led the Siamese forces against the Burmese. He was then promoted and eventually became the "Samuha Kalahom" as "Chao Phraya" Akkaramahasaena.
Rise of Prayurawongse.
Akka Mahasena was the primogenitor of the House of Bunnag. He sent his sons, including Dis and That, into the palace as the royal pages of Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke to gain an entrance into Siamese bureaucracy. Dis quickly rose to higher official ranks as Buddha Loetla Nabhalai favored the nobles from the Bunnag family and Dis's maternal family, the Bangchang. Dis then became the minister of "Krom Tha", supervising trade and foreign affairs under King Nangklao. 
He was offered the position of "Samuha Kalahom" (Second Prime Minister) by the king, but Dis declined, saying that prime ministers died early. He then became Samuha Kalahom instead.
During the Siamese-Vietnamese Wars, Dis led the Siamese forces to Vietnam and imposed a naval blockade on Saigon. The campaigns were successful, however, and the war ended in 1845. With the death of Bodindecha in 1849, Dis remained the only powerful noble in the court. 
Dis played a key role in the ascension of Mongkut, whether or not Nangklao intended to give the throne to his half-brother. The legend is that Nangklao wanted his son, Prince Annop, to succeed him, even giving Annop the bracelet passed down from his grandfather Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke. However, Dis switched the bracelet for a forged one, so the genuine one was not passed to Prince Annop. Dis lobbied for Mongkut, a monk of 27 years, to succeed the throne. 
In 1851, when Mongkut had succeeded the throne, he made Dis "Somdet Chao Phraya" Borom Maha Prayurawongse and regent in the kingdom. Prayurawongse's brother, That, became Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Pichaiyat and regent in Bangkok. The Somdet Chao Phraya title was the highest noble title, rivaling royalty. The first to hold the title," "Maha Kshatriyaseuk, had become the first monarch of Chakri dynasty.
Mongkut gave much of his power to the regents he appointed. Prayurawongse was also competent in trade and foreign affairs and crucial to negotiating the Bowring Treaty.
Sri Suriyawongse.
Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Sri Suriyawongse (Thai: สมเด็จเจ้าพระยาบรมมหาศรีสุริยวงศ์; Chuang Bunnag) was a prominent 19th-century Thai figure and served as the regent during the early years of the reign of King Chulalongkorn.
The eldest son of Dis Bunnag (Prayurawongse, สมเด็จเจ้าพระยาบรมมหาประยูรวงศ์) and Tan Poo-Ying Chan, Chuang was well educated. King Mongkut made him Samuha Kalahom, one of the two prime ministers of Old Siam.
After the death of King Mongkut in 1868, his young son Prince Chulalongkorn became the new monarch. However, as the new king was underage, Sri Suriyawongse was named as regent, a post he held until 1873. The Front Palace Crisis of 1874-5 changed the power dynamic in Siam, after which both Bunnag and noble influence waned.
Sri Suriyawongse died in 1883 in Ratchaburi. He was also the first Thai to have a life insurance policy, after Chulalongkorn granted foreign companies permission to extend their insurance business into Siam.
His son Won Bunnag succeeded him as Samuha Kalahom and also held the title Chao Phraya Surawongse.

<doc id="21432947" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21432947" title="Religion in the Outer Hebrides">
Religion in the Outer Hebrides

The inhabitants of the Outer Hebrides first practiced Celtic polytheist traditions. Several sites around the islands have been identified with pagan worship, such as the Callanish Stones.
Christianization likely began during the Roman occupation, and was spread by Irish missionaries. This Celtic Christianity had practices distinct from the Roman Catholic Church. Owing mainly to the different allegiances of the clans in the past, the people in the northern islands (Lewis, Harris, North Uist) have historically been predominantly Protestant, and those of the southern islands (Benbecula, South Uist, Barra) predominantly Roman Catholic. There are also small Episcopalian congregations in Lewis, though many of their members originate outside the islands.
The northern parts of the Outer Hebrides (particularly Lewis and Harris) have been described as the last bastion of fundamentalist Calvinism in Britain with large numbers of inhabitants belonging to the Free Church of Scotland or the still more conservative Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Services in the Free Church, the Free Presbyterian Church and some congregations of the Church of Scotland do not use instrumental music or any songs other than the metrical psalms.
It has also generally been considered unacceptable for people to appear in church improperly dressed, although this is slowly changing. Violations of this nature might include the failure by women to wear a hat, or trousers being worn instead of a skirt, or the wearing of informal clothing such as jeans. In December 2005 the local council refused to conduct ceremonies for same-sex couples wishing to register under the Civil Partnerships Act 2004.
Catholicism in the Hebrides.
The 2011 Scottish Census shows that the people of the southern islands are overwhelmingly Catholic. South Uist, the second-most populated of the Outer Hebrides, was 67.0% Catholic while Barra was even more so at 70.9% Catholic. The sparsely populated islands of Eriskay (84.8%) and Vatersay (80.0%) are also heavily Catholic while Benbecula is evenly divided between Catholics (40.6%) and Protestants (40.1%).
Notably, the southernmost of the Western Isles are the most Catholic parts of all of Scotland. The two most Catholic civil parishes in the entire country are in the Outer Hebrides:
Religion in Lewis.
Religion is important in Lewis, with much of the population belonging to one of five Presbyterian churches represented on the Island: the Free Church, the Free Church (Continuing), a congregation of the Associated Presbyterian Churches, the Free Presbyterian Church and the Church of Scotland. While Presbyterianism dominates Lewis, other Christian denominations have a presence with a Scottish Episcopal (Anglican) church, a Roman Catholic church, and an independent Pentecostal/Charismatic Church (New Wine Church). Furthermore, there is LDS Church and a Jehovah's Witness kingdom hall in Stronoway. A small Asian community beginning in the 1930s and reaching 300 at its peak introduced Islam to the islands. This community had fallen to eight families on Lewis (and one family on Harris) by 2010 so there is no immediate prospect of a mosque on the island. Bahá'í Faith has been on Isle of Lewis since 1953. See Bahá'í Faith in Scotland.
The Christian Sabbath is generally observed but some shops and licensed premises are open on that day (Sunday), although since 2002 there is a scheduled air service to mainland Scotland and since July 2009 a limited ferry service.
Stornoway Sabbath.
Stornoway, like the northern (Protestant) Hebrides as a whole, has a tradition of adherence to the Sabbath (Christian observance - on Sundays). As Stornoway, with the majority of the island's services, shops and businesses, undergoes the most visible change on a Sunday it is often seen as a focal point for the issue.
In recent years an increasing number of transport services have begun operating on a Sunday. The first Sunday air service began in October 2002 and was met by protests from church groups under the banner of the Lord's Day Observance Society. The Sunday air services have expanded – there are now two return flights to Inverness and one to Glasgow – as well as becoming generally more accepted. 
Ferry travel on Sundays from Lewis and Harris was initially possible after Caledonian MacBrayne introduced a Sunday service for the Sound of Harris ferry. The introduction of this service was not directly met with protests, but an opposing petition was signed by a significant majority of the local (South Harris) population.
It was announced on 14 July 2009 that Caledonian MacBrayne would begin to operate Sunday sailings from Sunday 19 July 2009. Before this, they would operate additional sailings on Sundays if several previous sailings have been cancelled, to allow the backlog of traffic to clear. Caledonian MacBrayne have said that they took legal advice that not implementing Sunday sailings would be against human rights legislation. Objections on religious grounds were raised to Caledonian MacBrayne's decision to commence ferry operations on Sundays.
There are still marked differences between Sundays on Lewis and Harris and those elsewhere in Britain and this particular example of Sunday observance only survives here, with the Sabbath continuing to be considered a day of rest. Opposition to a more cosmopolitan Sunday is not exclusively for religious reasons, though the strong Presbyterian (mainly Free Church) makeup of the island undoubtedly is a major force behind campaigns to retain Sunday's peaceful nature.
Hotels and restaurants are generally open along with most bars (some with shorter opening periods). A single Stornoway petrol station, Engebret, and its associated shop, is open from 11am to 4 pm. Another shop is open at Great Bernera. Sunday newspapers are not available as distributors will not work on Sundays.
Statistics.
A poll conducted in 2000 showed slightly more than 60% of islanders in favour of having ferry and air travel available on Sundays, though a still larger majority wanted a referendum on such matters – something that has not taken place. The same poll showed a clear majority against the opening of shops on Sunday.
Religion in Harris.
Harris has a largely Presbyterian population that practises sabbatarianism and all retail outlets are shut on Sunday. This area has been described as the last bastion of conservative Calvinism in Britain, and there was controversy in 2006 when Caledonian MacBrayne decided to commence operating a ferry service on Sundays between Berneray and Harris and in 2010 between Stornoway and the mainland.

History of the Philippines (900–1521)

The history of the Philippines (as opposed to its prehistory) is marked by the creation of the Laguna Copperplate Inscription (LCI), the first written document found in a Philippine language. The inscription itself identifies the date of its creation as the year 900. Prior to its discovery in 1989, the earliest record of the Philippine Islands corresponded with the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. The discovery of the LCI thus extended the record of Philippine history back by 600 years. After 900, the early history of territories and nation-states prior to being present-day Philippines is known through archeological findings and records of contacts with other civilizations such as Song Dynasty China and Brunei.
This article covers the history of the Philippines from the creation of the Laguna Copperplate Inscription in 900 AD to the arrival of European explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, which marks the beginning of the Philippine Colonial period (1565-1946).
The Laguna Copperplate Inscription and its context (c. 900AD).
In 1989, Antoon Postma deciphered the text of the Laguna Copperplate Inscription at the National Museum of the Philippines and discovered that it identified the date of its creation as the ""Year of Syaka 822, month of Vaisakha."" According to Jyotisha (Hindu astronomy), this corresponded with the year 900 A.D. Prior to the deciphering of the LCI, Philippine history was traditionally considered to begin at 1521, with the arrival of Magellan and his chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta. History could not be derived from pre-colonial records because such records typically did not survive: most of the writing was done on perishable bamboo or leaves. Because the deciphering of the LCI made it out to be the earliest written record of the islands that would later become the Philippines, the LCI reset the traditional boundaries between Philippine history and prehistory, placing the demarcation line 600 years earlier.
The inscription forgives the descendants of "Namwaran" from a debt of 926.4 grams of gold, and is granted by the chief of Tondo (an area in Manila) and the authorities of Paila, Binwangan and Pulilan, which are all locations in Luzon. The words are a mixture of Sanskrit, Old Malay, Old Javanese and Old Tagalog. The subject matter proves that a developed society existed in the Philippines prior to the Spanish colonization, as well as refuting earlier claims of the Philippines being a cultural isolate in Asia; the references to the Chief of Medang Kingdom in Indonesia imply that there were cultural and trade links with empires and territories in other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, particularly Srivijaya. Thus, aside from clearly indicating the presence of writing and of written records at the time, the LCI effectively links the cultural developments in the Philippines at the time with the growth of a thalassocratic civilization in Southeast Asia.
Barangay city-states and Thalassocracy.
Since at least the 3rd century, the indigenous peoples were in contact with other Southeast Asian and East Asian nations.
Even scattered barangays, through the development of inter-island and international trade, became more culturally homogeneous by the 4th century.Hindu-Buddhist culture and religion flourished among the noblemen in this era.
By the 9th century, a highly developed society had already established several hierarchies with set professions: The "Datu" or ruling class, the "Maharlika" or noblemen, the "Timawa" or freemen, and the dependent class which is divided into two, the "Aliping Namamahay" (Serfs) and "Aliping Saguiguilid" (Slaves).
Many of the "barangay" were, to varying extents, under the "de jure" jurisprudence of one of several neighboring empires, among them the Malay Sri Vijaya, Javanese Majapahit, Brunei, Malacca empires, although "de facto" had established their own independent system of rule. Trading links with Sumatra, Borneo, Thailand, Java, China, India, Arabia, Japan and the Ryukyu Kingdom flourished during this era. A thalassocracy had thus emerged based on international trade.
In the earliest times, the items which were prized by the people included jars, which were a symbol of wealth throughout South Asia, and later metal, salt and tobacco. In exchange, the people would trade feathers, rhino horn, hornbill beaks, beeswax, birds nests, resin, rattan.
In the period between the 7th century to the beginning of the 15th century, numerous prosperous centers of trade had emerged, including the Kingdom of Namayan which flourished alongside Manila Bay, Cebu, Iloilo, Butuan, the Kingdom of Sanfotsi situated in Pangasinan, the Kingdoms of Zabag and Wak-Wak situated in Pampanga and Aparri (which specialized in trade with Japan and the Kingdom of Ryukyu in Okinawa).
The Emergence of Baybayin and Related Scripts (1200 onwards).
The script used in writing down the LCI is Kawi, which originated in Java, and was used across much of Maritime Southeast Asia. But by at least the 13th century or 14th century, its descendant known in Tagalog as "Baybayin" was in regular use. The term baybayin literally means syllables, and the writing system itself is a member of the Brahmic family. One example of the use of Baybayin from that time period was found on an earthenware burial jar found in Batangas. Though a common perception is that Baybayin replaced Kawi, many historians believe that they were used alongside each other. Baybayin was noted by the Spanish to be known by everyone, and was generally used for personal and trivial writings. Kawi most likely continued to be used for official documents and writings by the ruling class. Baybayin was simpler and easier to learn, but Kawi was more advanced and better suited for concise writing.
Although Kawi came to be replaced by the Latin script, Baybayin continued to be used during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines up until the late 19th Century. Closely related scripts still in use among indigenous peoples today include Hanunóo, Buhid, and Tagbanwa.
Chinese Trade (982 AD onwards).
The earliest date suggested for direct Chinese contact with the Philippines was 982 AD. At the time, merchants from "Ma-i" (now in Mindoro) brought their wares to Guangzhou. This was noted by the Sung Shih (History of the Sung) by Ma Tuan-lin who compiled it with other historical records in the Wen-hsien T’ung-K’ao at the time around the transition between the Sung and Yuan dynasties.
However, actual trade between China and the proto-Philippine states probably started much earlier.
The growth of Islamic Sultanates (1380 onwards).
In 1380, Makhdum Karim, the first Islamic missionary to the Philippines brought Islam to the Archipelago. Subsequent visits of Arab, Malay and Javanese missionaries helped strengthen the Islamic faith of the Filipinos, most of whom (except for those in the north) would later become Christian under the Spanish colonization. The Sultanate of Sulu, the largest Islamic kingdom in the islands, encompassed parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. The royal house of the Sultanate claim descent from the Prophet Muhammad.
Around 1405, the year that the war over succession ended in the Majapahit Empire, Sufi traders introduced Islam into the Hindu-Malayan empires and for about the next century the southern half of Luzon and the islands south of it were subject to the various Muslim sultanates of Borneo. During this period, the Japanese established a trading post at Aparri and maintained a loose sway over northern Luzon.
Attack by Sultanate of Brunei (1500 A.D.).
Around the year 1500 AD, the Kingdom of Brunei under Sultan Bolkiah attacked the kingdom of Tondo and established a city with the Malay name of Selurong (later to become the city of Maynila) on the opposite bank of Pasig River. The traditional Rajahs of Tondo, the Lakandula, retained their titles and property but the real political power came to reside in the House of Soliman, the Rajahs of Manila.
Expansion of Trade (1st Century - 14th Century AD).
Jocano refers to the time between the 1st and 14th Century AD as the Philippines' "emergent phase". It was characterized by intensive trading, and saw the rise of definable social organization, and, among the more progressive communities, the rise of certain dominant cultural patterns. The advancements that brought this period were made possible by the increased use of iron tools, which allowed such stable patterns to form. This era also saw the development of writing. The first surviving written artifact from the Philippines, now known as the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, was written in 900 AD, marking the end of what is considered Philippine prehistory and heralding the earliest phase of Philippine history - that of the time between the first written artifact in 900 AD and the arrival of colonial powers in 1521.
The Spanish Conquista (1521–1565).
Filipino historians note an overlap in the history of pre-colonial Philippines and the Spanish colonial period, noting that while Magellan's arrival in 1521 marked the first arrival of European colonizers to this country, it was not until the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565 that the Europeans had any marked impact on the lifestyle of the residents of the Philippine Archipelago.
National Historical Institute and National Commission for Culture and the Arts chair Ambeth Ocampo notes:
Primary Sources for Early Philippine History.
Primary sources for this period in Philippine history are sparse, which explains why so little is known. It is however, postulated that during the more than 300 years of Spain's colonization, Spanish authorities in the Philippine had successfully cleared through burning or burying written records and other documentaries that would establish proof of governance on the various existing small kingdoms and sultanates they subdued. This is evidenced by the Laguna Copperplate Inscription written in copper metal sheet. The inscription writing in Kawi script manifest the existence of a developed writing system and government structure prior to the arrival of Spaniards and its subsequent establishment of Spanish colonies.
The LCI is both the earliest local source on this era and the earliest primary source, with the Calatagan jar being more or less contemporary, although the translation of the text on the jar is in some question. Early contacts with Japan, China, and by Muslim traders produced the next set of primary sources. Genealogical records by Muslim Filipinos who trace their family roots to this era constitute the next set of sources. Another short primary source concerns the attack by Brunei's king Bolkiah on Manila Bay in 1500. Finally, and perhaps with the most detail, Spanish chroniclers in the 17th century collected accounts and histories of that time, putting into writing the remembered history of the later part of this era, and noting the then-extant cultural patterns which at that time had not yet been swept away by the coming tide of hispanization.

Domestic violence in Australia

In Australia, the issue of domestic violence is addressed through the use of Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders (ADVO). The use of ADVO and APVO illustrates several flaws within the system. ADVOs have failed to provide protection for people who have abusive partners. There have been many incidents where the victim was beaten to death even though they had obtained an ADVO against their partner. The law has subsequently responded by enforcing new domestic violence laws. The Daily Telegraph article from May 2008 stated that under these new proposed laws, those accused of domestic violence would only have one week to plead guilty. These new laws aimed to improve resource efficiency by removing delays that may occur during court cases, thus making the process less traumatic for the victims
In 2002 the Federal Government established the National Initiative to Combat Sexual Assault with funding of $16.1 million. On top of that there is a $50 million funding for the Partnership Against Domestic Violence.
In 2012 the Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act was amended to reflect contemporary understandings of domestic and family violence. Examples of relationships that fall under the new act are same-sex relationships & "one night stands" where a child is produced.
Domestic violence may include numerous factors including: emotional, verbal, social, economic, psychological, spiritual, physical and sexual abuse.

<doc id="21433033" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21433033" title="Nkima">
Nkima

Nkima is a fictional character in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan novels, and in adaptations of the saga to other media, particularly comics.
His name comes from either the word N'kima ('monkey' in the Mbugu language, a regional corruption of Swahili), or, after the Meru language nickname for Ugali, a dish popular in Kenya and Tanzania made from maize flour (if the latter, it would be similar to a European giving a child the nickname 'donut' -- a playful, condescending-yet-benevolent term of endearment). 
Character.
An African monkey, Nkima serves as a companion and servile assistant to Tarzan; provides comic relief in storylines; covertly conveys messages between Tarzan and his allies (rarely targeted by adversaries, who underestimate and overlook him); and, even occasionally leads Tarzan's Waziri warrior and/or animal friends to the ape-man's rescue. Overall, Nkima's role in the novels is somewhat similar to that of Cheeta the chimpanzee in the Tarzan movies. He is portrayed as being especially close to Jad-bal-ja, the lion who served as Tarzan's other primary animal companion.
In personality, Nkima is fearful and paranoid when alone, miserably certain that all other jungle creatures view him as prey. When with Tarzan he is emboldened, becoming proud, boastful, and bloodthirsty, constantly urging his protector to kill any strange animal they encounter. However, he is also fiercely loyal, often providing valuable assistance to the ape-man at great personal risk. In "Tarzan's Quest," Nkima's merit was recognized when he was given an immortality treatment along with the novel's human protagonists.
In the Tarzan novels.
Nkima first appeared in the twelfth Tarzan novel (1928's "Tarzan and the Lost Empire"), and re-appeared in the fourteenth (1930's "Tarzan the Invincible"); eighteenth (1932's "Tarzan and the Leopard Men"); nineteenth (1936's "Tarzan's Quest"); twenty-fourth (1965's "Tarzan and the Castaways" -- a collection of stories, including the 1939 short story, "and the Champion"); and, twenty-sixth (1995's "") books. Nkima was also mentioned in passing in the twenty-second novel, "Tarzan and the Foreign Legion" (1947).
In other media.
The character of Nkima was also featured in the Tarzan comic strip and comic books, both in adaptations of the original/Burroughs novels, and in stories newly-written for those media. He had one film appearance, in the 1935 serial, "The New Adventures of Tarzan" (also released in 1938 as the feature film, "Tarzan and the Green Goddess" -- although re-cast as a chimpanzee and portrayed by Jiggs, the same chimp that originated the role of "Cheeta" in the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films).
Nkima was also a main character in Filmation's 1976-1981, Saturday morning animated series "Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle"; the depiction was faithful to Burroughs' characterization. His monkey-like 'speech' was voiced by Lou Scheimer.

Rose and Crown Club

The Rose and Crown Club was a club for artists, collectors and connoisseurs of art in early 18th-century London, England.
History.
The Rose and Crown Club "for Eminent Artificers of this Nation" was formed by 1704, when the engraver George Vertue was admitted; while it lasted, the club was among the more important of clubs for artists and connoisseurs. The club was initially "a bawdy assembly of younger artists and cognoscenti, which met weekly" and apparently held its meetings at the Rose and Crown public house. in addition to Vertue, members included Bernard Lens III, Christian Friedrich Zincke, William Hogarth, Peter Tillemans, and Michael Dahl. 
The members of the club were known as the 'Rosacoronians'. An unfinished Hogarthian painting in the Ashmolean Museum attributed to the Scottish painter Gawen Hamilton, "An Assembly of Virtuosi", shows a group of fifteen men, including eight who are identified in an etching of the painting by R. Cooper, published by W. B. Tiffin (1829), and it has been suggested that this is a group portrait of the Rosacoronians. The group includes Hamilton himself, Michael Dahl, John Vanderbank, the architect William Kent, and John Michael Rysbrack the sculptor. Vertue listed the painter and engraver Gerhard Bockman as a member in 1724. 
The club was well connected with the older-established Virtuosi of St Luke ("c." 1689–1743), with which it is sometimes confused, although it was less prestigious.
The Rose and Crown Club remained in existence until 1745 and held its last meeting at the Half-Moon Tavern. Bignamini notes in his "George Vertue" that

Autonomist Association

The Autonomist Association (; ; ) was a political party in Fiume, that existed continuously from 1896 to 1914. Its goal was to maintain the autonomy of the corpus separatum of Fiume within the Hungarian Kingdom.
Origins.
It is very difficult to trace the origins of the party, since it appeared as an organised political grouping only in 1896. However, already at the municipal elections in 1887 a party named Partito Autonomo appeared, but nothing is known about its internal composition and goals. Moreover, very similar claims were already in the 1860s when the priority was to gain autonomy from Croatia
In its mature form fiuman Autonomists were focused in assuring a greater deal of autonomy for Fiume within the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen, from the 1880s up to 1914.
The First Phase (1896-1902).
In 1896 Michele Maylender, claiming greater autonomy from the centralizing Hungarian executive of Dezső Bánffy, founded the Autonomist Party. The initiative was successful and in 1897 Maylender was elected mayor, succeeding to the late Giovanni de Ciotta, who held the position continuously from 1872 to 1897. The election of Maylender was the decisive signal of political change under way in Fiume. It culminated when the Municipal council of Fiume was dissolved and was finally replaced by a Royal Commissioner, the ministerial adviser Antonio de Valentsits in 1898. After that Maylender started a weekly magazine "La Difesa" where the autonomist claims were made explicit.
"La Difesa", the official party paper of the "Associazione Autonoma", was the first modern political party paper in Fiume, directed and founded by Maylender, who was also probably the owner. The paper started its publication on 1 January 1899, in Sušak on the Croatian side, where the Croatian (Austrian) laws on the press were in force.
The Concept of Nation and State.
"La Difesa" represented first of all, a defensive movement – as stated by the title of its paper meaning "defence". The autonomist interpretation of the Hungarian state was primarily aimed at reducing Hungarian sovereignty and political subjectivity: the Hungarian government was a temporary authority, since the city was not an integral part of Hungary. Although Hungary assured prosperity to the city, in the interpretation of autonomists, Hungarian rule was provisory in the sense that it could always have been receded. As the Croats, they denied the existence of a unitary Hungarian state but instead it was the “Holy Crown of the Lands of St. Stephen”, united under the sceptre of the House of Habsburg. Fiume was one of the Lands that constituted the Hungarian state, together with the Kingdom of Hungary and the Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia. The City of Fiume itself was annexed to Hungary by force of the diploma of Maria Theresa.
As for sovereignty, neither Hungary nor Croatia who were claiming their sovereignty over Fiume were sovereign states nor subjects of international law, that status pertained only to Austria – that is to the Habsburg monarchy. The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 was an internal administrative arrangement, to which Croatia was similarly related to Hungary. In the analysis done by La Difesa and reported on several articles it was inadmissible for Fiume to be treated as a "colony" since its status within the Habsburg Empire or the Hungarian Kingdom was comparable to that of Hungary.
"La Difesa" reviewed the position of cities with a comparable status to Fiume. Trieste and the privileged position it enjoyed in Austria was the obvious prime example. Germany, during the process of unification, that the Hungarians frequently referred to as a model, provided another interesting parallel. While the continental free cities lost their rights and privileges “disappearing politically” not so those of the Hanseatic league such as Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg. States that foster economic development via the maritime trade give to free ports ample liberties sanctioned by statutes in order to leave them free that with their international connections knowledge and expertise. Thus the proper institutional model for Fiume was the “Hanseatic model”.
But what about the nationality of the autonomists? Maylender defined the “Fiuman nationality” as a specific nationality: if Fiumans had to change their nationality accordingly to their sovereigns they would have changed at least 7 nationalities since 1509: his answer was that no one fitted perfectly to them, thus they were a national.
The Populist Drive.
When in 1901 Kálmán Széll succeeded to Dezső Bánffy as Hungarian Prime Minister he seriously tried to restore a positive climate in the city, and Maylender was once again elected to the office of mayor. Meanwhile, the mandate of the fiuman deputy at the Hungarian parliament was about to expire. In the new climate the majority of the Autonomist Party thought "it was time to send an Italian" (the office was held by count Lajos Batthyány) and it addressed Maylender. Maylender refused, and Luigi Ossoinack decided to advance the candidacy of the young Riccardo Zanella.
Maylender was ousted from public life, and the Autonomist Party replaces its leader with Francesco Vio, who is elected podestà to replace Maylender, on 10 January 1902. Vio was a representative of the moderate current within the Associazione Autonoma, but the man behind the scenes was certainly still Luigi Ossoinack, who continued to finance the party.
Although Batthyany (publicly backed by Maylender) won over Zanella, Maylender resigned few months after and withdrew from politics, officially he devoted himself to historical studies and started the monumental "History of the Academies of Italy" a work, published posthumously, of still unmatched scope.
Zanella was now entering the scene. Schooled in the Hungarian schools in Fiume, and a graduate from the Commercial Academy in Budapest, possessed the right blend of characteristics: a good command of Hungarian and other languages, a network of friends, knowledge of administration and intellectual and psychological inferiority compared to his sponsors. He will manage to become the most popular Fiuman political leader ever.
But there was also a more substantial change: while Maylender was (as Ciotta had previously been) the men of the Party of Government that is the Liberal Party of Deak and Tisza, Zanella felt much closer to the Kossuthian current within the Hungarian political scene. The clash between Liberalism and radicalism in Hungary, was since the 1850s reflected also in Fiume with Gaspare Matcovich as the local leader of the Kossuthists and Giovanni de Ciotta of the Deákist faction.
A silent revolution was consumed within the ranks of the autonomists. On 4 April 1902, in the article "Metamorfosi di un partito" on his "Voce del popolo", Zanella in an analysis of the political situation in Hungary, depicted the Hungarian Liberal Party as an aristocratic expression of Hungarian national feelings, while the “Party of 1848” is the popular and democratic form of the same. There was no difference in contents or the political project, it was only the external visual manifestation that changed, following the evolution of Hungarian society.
Zanella adapted the arguments of Kossuthian populism to the Fiuman situation: claiming that in Fiume increasingly the economy and society was controlled by Hungarians, he mirrored the Kossuthian claims about the Austrian dominance upon Hungary. From the beginnings he will resort to rhetoric borrowed from Italian nationalism and irredentism, anticipated already by his first electoral proclaim.
Zanella, writing in 1905, claimed that there was a genuine Fiuman nationality and identity that comprised Italian, Croatian, and Hungarian elements as well, and that was loyal to the (multinational) State of the Crown of St. Stephen, not to Hungary (that was a nation). Zanella claimed that it was offensive for the Fiumani to be labelled as “Italians” by the Hungarian government. According to Zanella, the inhabitants of Fiume are called Fiumani but are themselves composed of “three nationalities”: the Italians that is the autonomists who were for centuries the “old dominators of the land” but also the Croats and the Hungarians.
Zanella changed the paradigm: Hungary had its state right within the Empire since it was the land of the Magyar nation. Similarly, Croatia retained its autonomy and state right because of its historical and national specificity. The same applied to Fiume: as kossuthism and the Independence and 1848 Party proclaimed national independence as the ultimate political goal for Hungarians, in Fiume both Frano Supilo and Zanella started their policies of "New Course". Both paths were basically secessionist and ready to look at new allies (Serbs for Supilo, with the resulting Resolution of Fiume) and Croats for Zanella, who helped Supilo providing him with the necessary contacts with the Kossuthian faction in Hungary.
Cleavages.
The cleavage between the Deákists and Kossuthists in Fiume was to reappear soon. Andrea Ossoinack the son of Luigi (who committed suicide in 1902), announced a secession from the Autonomist Party, remarking that all the nationalities (and thereby also the Croatian) in Fiume had the right to be represented, and the need for a closer collaboration with Hungary, precondition for the economical development of the port city.
Thus, in the 1905 elections for the Fiuman representative at the Hungarian parliament, Andrea Ossoinack was publicly supported by the governor Ervin báró Roszner. Against him runs Zanella, the candidate of a “committee of citizens” led by the old Kossuthist Antonio Walluschnig. Andrea Ossoinack helped Zanella and financially supported his paper La Voce del Popolo. Now, in 1905, they were opposed to each other. Andrea Ossoinack from a champion of the militant autonomists (as was his father) will gradually position himself as a reliable political partner for the Hungarians against the Kossuthist drift. But, on 29 January 1905, Riccardo Zanella won and was elected Fiuman representative at the Hungarian parliament. 1905 was the only time that the Independence and 1848 party, won the elections but the King Franz Joseph rejected the result. Chamber had been dissolved by military force (19 February 1906), and a uniformed colonel read a royal decree dissolving it. Géza Fejérváry, formerly minister for national defence
was appointed prime minister in a government of bureaucrats.The former "united opposition" (with whom Zanella sided) was allowed to form a government only after it gave up its major demands for an independent Hungarian army and tariff system.
Political instability resulting form the Hungarian Constitutional Crisis of 1903–1907 was felt in Fiume as well, as governors were changed frequently. The pact concluded (8 April 1906) between the Coalition and the crown paved the way for the Agreement, reached in October 1907 thanks chiefly to the sobering of Hungarian opinion by a severe economic crisis. In Fiume already on 28 June 1907, with 45 votes on 52 voters, the civic Rappresentanza elected Francesco Vio as mayor of Fiume. Zanella got only 6 ballots, and his extremism was not rewarded by the electorate. On 15 June 1908 there was a congress of the Autonomist Association where, after the defeat, Zanella was emarginated.
During 1908 and 1909 life in Fiume appeared still: apart from growing national polarisation of the Italian with the Croatians, the relations with the Hungarian government appeared to be improving. On 15 June 1909 – the Congress of the Autonomist Association elects a “Provisional Directorate” with the task of reorganizing the party for the next extraordinary congress.
On 25 June 1909, Governor Sándor gróf Nákó de Nagyszentmiklós resigned, and now the vice governor István gróf Wickenburg de Capelló, an heir of the Austro-Venetian nobility, was put in his place. In January 1910 in Hungary was a big political change: the Hungarian Liberal Party reorganised and appeared with the new name of National Labour Party whose leader was still Count István Tisza. The municipal elections took place on 13 April 1910 – the Autonomist Party won the elections convincingly in the city casting 718 ballots out of 845 voters, but what was more important Maylender returned to active politics after almost a decade of exile spent on finishing his monumental Storia delle Accademie d'Italia. On 8 June 1910 at the new elections in Hungary for the Parliament, Maylender wins convincingly with 970 votes against Zanella who gets 566, out of 2.337 electors.
Károly Khuen-Héderváry, a consummate political leader, who as Ban (title) had previously ruled Croatia for twenty years from 1883 to 1903, now on 17 January 1910, become head of the Hungarian executive. He will rule Hungary for two years up to 22 April 1912, and as in Croatia will prove very efficient in crushing opposition in Fiume as well.
On 15 June 1910 after the defeat the new direction of the Autonomist Party (the Associazione autonoma) is elected: Zanella, was nominated president. The Autonomist Party was now "de facto" divided in two factions, since both of the candidates were officially autonomists. On 23 June 1910, at the Rappresentanza Civica Zanella spoke against the persecutions to which the Italians are victims in Fiume and concludes that Hungary is about to lose Fiume if it will continue this discriminatory policy against the local population. On 26 June 1910, podestà Francesco Vio resigns, adducing motives of health. There is thus a creeping conflict: he is between the Hungarians of Khuen and Wickenburg and the local opposition led by Zanella and Baccich, that becomes more and more aggressive. The provisional podestà was now Corossacz, an ally of Zanella.
On 30 November 1910 István gróf Wickenburg de Capelló, took office as acting governor but the official ceremony instead at the municipal hall was celebrated at the cathedral church. The event infringed the tradition and was discussed even at the Hungarian parliament, on December, the 9th 1910. Maylender, who backed the governor, was attacked by Tivadar Batthyány with the argument that since is was Maylender who created Autonomism and championed the struggle against Banffy he should have been among the first to react. Albert Appony claimed that the preservation of Fiuman autonomy was a strategic interest of Hungary since any action in the opposite direction would have given greater chances to Croatian propaganda to succeed.
The reactions in Fiume were immediate: on 16 December 1910 – at the session of the Rappresentanza, Zanella exploits the moment and fiercely attacks Maylender with a lengthy speech. Possibly related to this attack on February the 9th 1911, Maylender suddenly dies at the Hungarian parliament in Budapest, by a heart stroke.
The ongoing division within the Autonomists successfully infiltrated by Hungarian authorities produced its effects: on 2 April 1911 – a New party named Lega autonoma was formed whose head is the ex podestà Francesco Vio. The strategy of the Lega was much less based on the exploitation of the public opinion in any sense or direction. Its exponents were in fact prominent businessman (think of Ossoinack and the heavily subsidised Adria) that lived and prospered thanks to Hungarian economy.
Both groups were playing opportunistically. The group of Zanella (the Associazione Autonoma) followed daily Hungarian politics, trying to cut all possible alliances. Vio appears to keep distance from Zanella openly condemning its conflicting stance towards the Hungarian authorities that “did much harm to the city”. Zanella attacked the leghisti as they were called because of their unabashed compromising attitude with the Hungarians.
On May the 5th 1911, after the death of Maylender, elections Zanella is again the champion of the Fiuman (and Hungarian) Kossuthist opposition to replace the Fiuman representative at the Hungarian parliament. Antonio Vio junior, is candidate from the «Lega autonoma» and the Hungarian labour party, headed by count Istvan Tisza. Vio won over Zanella, and on 8 June 1911 – the «Lega autonoma» made public its programme and the candidates. Several former members of the Associazione Autonoma are now in its ranks: including Vio, Ossoinack, Mohovich, and others now lined up with Governor Wickemburg and Khuen-Hedervary. On 20 June 1911, at the Municipal elections, the Lega Autonoma of Vio defeats the Associazione Autonoma of Zanella for just 46 ballots. Some of the Associazione Autonoma enter however in the Rappresentanza.
In the years before the outbreak of the Great War it is clear that the Hungarian government under the lead of Khuen who effectively put into control Croatia attempted to do the same in Fiume. And as in Croatia Khuen was successful in Fiume, achieving a complete victory for the Hungarian government. Zanella was now pushed towards Italian irredentism.
First World War.
The central government, With Khuen as the Prime Minister of Hungary succeeded to put Fiuman politics under complete control, and that already before the Great War broke. Obviously, the possibilities for the Fiumani to have an influence in local politics was greatly reduced, being confined at the defence of the municipal "italianità".
The administration of the tiny "corpus separatum", was now entrusted to the "Giunta governiale amministrativa", an administrative body whose members were appointed by the Hungarian Governor in Fiume. The Municipal Police was now sided by the Hungarian State Police, the judiciary had its Courts of Appeal in Budapest, and there was an Administrative Tribunal in Fiume as well that as the Tribunal, were firmly under Hungarian control. The number of Hungarian schools was rising continuously, as well as the proportion of those in Italian where more and more classes were taught in Hungarian. Finally, in 1912 a “Superior Commercial Academy” was instituted in Fiume, a first step for a planned Hungarian university. Therefore, the ongoing conflict with the Hungarian government reached its height at a time of maximum prosperity and economic development of the “Jewel of the Hungarian Crown”.
On 20 June 1913 the Governor suspends the Rappresentanza for “opposition to the laws of the State”, and for “perturbation” of the “constituted order”. In Fiume the political climate was very tense and all the political fractions in the city were opposing the governmental measures. Disillusion was the dominant feeling in Fiume of 1914, fuelled by the press. but the elections showed once more the extant fracture within Fiumani politics. The Lega renounced to nominate its candidates and Zanella was easily elected as the new mayor.
Although Zanella showed a clear will to compromise with the Hungarians essentially in an anti Croatian fashion, the King Franz Joseph explicitly refused to accept his election as podestà of Fiume on 10 April 1914. On April, the 18th 1914 Francesco Gilberto Corrosacz is elected as a new podestà of Fiume.
Frustration was growing, fuelled by those Fiumani who within the Giovine Fiume were already embracing irredentism, questioning the traditional strategy of fiuman politics, playing among the two great Hungarian parties.
With the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war to Serbia, most of the Fiuman industry was reorganised for military production. The port was paralysed by the war and greatly reduced its activities. The local press, now subject to war censure, came under direct supervision from the offices of the Hungarian governor (procura). Initially, in the first year of war the Monarchy was in war with Serbia while Italy was neutral. Therefore, even by admission by Italian nationalists, in Fiume the Croats and Serbs in Fiume were the most hardly pressed by the military and police authorities, not the Italians.
On 23 May 1915, Italy by declaring war to the Austro-Hungarian monarchy enters the war on Entente side. By that time many Italian immigrants in Fiume had already left the city, soon followed by Hungarian banks and commercial enterprises who moved back to Budapest.
The war itself did not struck Fiume, the city reported a single aerial attack performed by an Italian Zeppelin ("Città di Ferrara"), that bombed the torpedo works and some port facilities. The fiumani (out of some 12–14000 mobilised) experienced a remarkably low number of casualties – reportedly due to their massive desertion rate.
The Rappresentanza formally continued to gather, but war forced many of its members to army service or to exile. The communal government had to apply the ministerial ordinances. The papers that marked the age as the "Voce del Popolo" of Zanella and the "Novi List" of Supilo ceased with their publications since both editors were now in exile.
The Rappresentanza was dissolved on 5 June 1915, with the pretentious reason of a quarrel among the councillors. Francesco Gilberto Corrosacz podestà of Fiume was removed from office. The Lega Autonoma, the party allied with the government, swiftly gained power. Their exponent Antonio Vio, at the time deputy of Fiume at the Hungarian parliament was nominated podestà. After Vio’s resignation form the position of deputy of Fiume at the Hungarian parliament, Andrea Ossoinack, the old adversary of Zanella, and head of the Lega Autonoma was elected “by acclamation” on 10 October 1915 deputy of Fiume at the Hungarian parliament. For the first time, the new elected Rappresentanza had 12 Hungarian councillors imposed by the Hungarian government.
After the Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto, on 12 September 1917 the group of nominated Hungarians to the Rappresentanza gathered to discuss ho to put a remedy to the “injustices that the Hungarian community was suffering by the Fiuman citizens”. Given the delicacy of the task, the reunion was kept secret. The group produced also a program document on how was Fiume to be reorganised after the expected victory. The report was organised according to several priority points: the first was the Language Question – Hungarian language was to become official at the municipal government since it was the language of the State. The Rappresentanza had to use also the Hungarian language and the vice president had to be a Hungarian, the number of Hungarians involved in the municipal affairs had to be augmented.
The conclusions of the report provide an interesting evaluation of the real extent of autonomy: The political position of Fiume in the Provisory was the outcome of the struggle between Italians and the Slavs for the possession of the City. It was only the municipal government of Fiume who resisted these attempts and therefore the "italianità" of the municipality had to be preserved in what looks as a strategic deal between the fiumani and the Hungarians. The autonomy was only a fiction masked with the insistence on the Italian language and culture – the "italianità", that was seen as "the" way for realising the Hungarian plans for Fiume, after the Great War.

Acoustic radiation force

Acoustic radiation force is a physical phenomenon resulting from the interaction of an acoustic wave with an obstacle placed along its path. Generally, the force exerted on the obstacle is evaluated by integrating the acoustic radiation pressure (due to the presence of the sonic wave) over its time-varying surface.
The magnitude of the force exerted by an acoustic plane wave at any given location can be calculated as:
where 
The effect of frequency on acoustic radiation force is taken into account via intensity (higher pressures are more difficult to attain at higher frequencies) and absorption (higher frequencies have a higher absorption rate). As a reference water has an acoustic absorption of 0.002 dB/(MHz2cm).
Medical imaging applications.
Acoustic radiation force is currently being used in medical ultrasonic imaging to generate images based on the mechanical properties; the discipline of creating these images is called elastography. Modalities include Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Imaging, Shearwave Dispersion Ultrasound Vibrometry, Harmonic Motion Imaging (HMI), Supersonic Shear Imaging (SSI), and Spatially Modulated Ultrasound Radiation Force (SMURF).

In addition to this, MRML publishes and reprints books in collaboration with university presses, independent publishers, scholars, and institutions around the world.
History.
Munshiram Manoharlal belongs to a family of publishers who were the pioneers in Indological publishing in India. The origins of the family business can be traced back to 1870 in Lahore where books were published under the name of the ancestral company which was founded by Mehar Chand Jain. He named it Meharchand Lachhmandas. Mehar Chand Jain, a widely respected literary figure, had translated the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs, into English. The British decorated him for his ground-breaking work. The company slowly expanded and its publications were being sold at premier bookstores all over the country.
Meharchand Lachhmandas became the first to publish several classic, essential, and perennial texts in the field of Indology and became the premier Indological publisher with a long list of published titles. It had a vast collection of manuscripts and publications from around the world at its bookshops. Lahore was the centre of education at that time and the company's bookshops specialized in Indology. It flourished for three subsequent generations, i.e., Lachhman Das Jain, Munshi Ram Jain, and Manohar Lal Jain.
In 1947, just before the partition of India, the offices, press, bookstore, and residence were burned down by Muslim activists. Fortunately, the women and children of the family had been evacuated earlier to Amritsar. Soon afterwards, Manohar Lal Jain was forced to flee to Amritsar to take refuge, and was helped by kind Muslim neighbours, who helped him escape safely across the border. The family was once again united, but with no business or assets.
After the partition of India, there was a split in the family business. Manohar Lal Jain separated from the parent company Meharchand Lachhmandas to set up his own bookselling and publishing company. In 1948, he sold the jewelry his wife had brought with her from Lahore, and with that money, steps were taken to re-establish the business. Since Manohar Lal Jain was a well-known publisher with an excellent reputation, it was not difficult for him to restart the business. His services to the literary world were recognized and the business flourished once again.
In 1952, Munshiram Manoharlal was founded as a bookselling and publishing company at Nai Sarak in Delhi. It soon gained popularity and respect and became a leading Indological publisher, bookseller, and library-supplier from India. Munshiram Manoharlal's publications, along with other publications from the Indian subcontinent, were now being marketed aggressively in the South Asian market and exported to countries all over the world.
Manohar Lal Jain passed away in 1988 due to cardiac arrest. Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd. is now run by his son and his grandson, namely Ashok Jain and Vikram Jain respectively.

The Dell (Thurrock)

The Dell is a house in Grays built in concrete - one of the earliest houses in Britain to be built in this material. It was built on the instructions of Alfred Russel Wallace who lived in Grays from 1872 until 1876.
The house.
There is a plan of the ground floor of the Dell in the Natural History Museum. This was drawn and annotated by Wallace himself. It may be a draft of the final plans, which were prepared by Wonnacott. The Natural History Museum also has a front view of the house in black ink on waxed linen, coloured with blue and brown inks. This too was possibly drawn by Wallace, although it is unsigned. It shows a grand entrance porch to a house with three levels and a fourth-level attic room. There are three chimneys on the main house and a one-storey wing extending to the right. The house overlooked the Thames and on the ground floor there was a large dining room, a library or drawing room, a breakfast room, a veranda, and a kitchen. It was connected to the local gas supply and collected rainwater, although this supplied only the sink and lavatory.
Life at the Dell.
Wallace expected to settle in Grays and live in his new home for the rest of his life. Over the next four years he wrote and published a number of articles and scientific papers, particularly the two volumes of The Geographical Distribution of Animals. In 1873 he started to keep a notebook, including gardening notes from the Dell entitled '1873 Calendar of flowering plants at the Dell'. These are now part of the Wallace collection at the Natural History Museum.
While living at the Dell, Wallace continued to correspond with Darwin. He also took an interest in topics such as social reform and spiritualism, which latter, particularly, was to lead him into difficulties with the mainstream of the scientific establishment. Unfortunately, Wallace’s young son died and the family stayed in the Dell for only four and a half years. He lived in several places after Grays.
The Dell after Wallace.
Wallace left the Dell in 1876 and the house was sold. The sale particulars describe it as having views that "would well repay a visit". At that time the "unusually attractive" grounds included a fountain and a croquet lawn as well as winding walks and terrace. The house was bought by William Winch Hughes, founder of the Victoria Wine Company.
The Dell survives as number 25 College Avenue and is now a Grade II listed building with the date of construction prominently displayed. It is currently used as a convent by the Sisters of La Sainte-Union des Sacrés-Coeurs order of nuns. On Saturday 14 September 2002, a green Thurrock Heritage plaque on the building was unveiled by Wallace's grandson to commemorate Wallace's role in developing the theory of natural selection.
In April 2013, the house was offered for sale at £1.5m.

Rabri

Rabri (IAST: ; Urdu:ربڑئ, ) is an Indian and Pakistani sweet dish made with dahi (yogurt), flour, and a combination of bajre ki roti. It is usually eaten at lunch. Raabri is mostly made in north, central and western India and Pakistan. Flour of Pearl millet ("Bajri") is mixed with buttermilk to make a thick sauce which is kept in the sun to ferment. After about 3 to 4 hours, it is cooked by boiling it until the flour is cooked. It may be eaten hot as soup, but it is usually kept overnight. It may be mixed with yogurt or buttermilk. Cumin seeds ("zeera"), dry fruits, etc., can be used as garnish.
Variants.
Sweet Rabri is a sweet, condensed milk based dish made by boiling the milk on low heat for a long time until it becomes dense and changes its color to pinkish. Sugar, spices and nuts are added to it to give it flavor. It is chilled and served as dessert. Rabri is the main ingredient in several desserts, such as rasaballi, chhena kheeri, and kheersagar. Rabri can also be made savoury with salt, masala, and zeera.
Calcutta Rabri.
The quintessential Rabri from Calcutta has probably been handed down from the Rabri that is originally from Varanasi. This very rich dessert is made by heating sweetened milk in a large open vessel ("kadhai"). As the layer of cream begins to form on the surface of the milk, it is taken off and kept aside. The process continues until the milk is exhausted. The Rabri thus formed is extremely creamy and very heavy on the stomach, but loved by the average Bengali. Rabri was banned in Calcutta for sometime during the years of milk scarcity because of the fact that it uses up a large quantity of milk.

Mark Bell (footballer)

Mark Dickson Bell (8 February 1881 – 22 October 1961) was a Scottish footballer who played for Heart of Midlothian in the early years of the Twentieth century, helping them to win the Scottish Cup in 1901, before moving to southern England where he won Southern League championships with Southampton and Fulham. He won one international cap with Scotland in 1901.
Football career.
Heart of Midlothian.
Bell was born in Edinburgh and after junior football with Roseberry and St Bernard's, he joined Heart of Midlothian in April 1900. In his first season with Hearts, he was joint top scorer (with Bill Porteous) with eight goals and was a member of the team that won the Scottish Cup, defeating Division One runners-up Celtic 4–3. He earned his solitary cap for Scotland in a 1–1 draw with Wales on 2 March 1901.
At Hearts he was regarded as a nippy forward, equally at home on either wing. In 1901–02 he helped Hearts to third place in the Scottish League table.
Southampton.
In 1902, he moved to the south coast of England, where Southampton were attempting to reclaim the Southern League title and recruited six new players, including fellow Scots, Jack Robertson from Liverpool and Jack Fraser from St Mirren. 
Bell made his debut on 18 October 1902, standing in for Joe Turner, in a 1–1 draw at Kettering Town. Injury prevented him making regular appearances, although he made six consecutive league (and three in the FA Cup) in January and February replacing the injured Dick Evans. Bell contributed six league goals, plus one in the cup, including a pair in an 11–0 victory over Watford on 13 December 1902. This remains the "Saints" joint highest victory margin in League football.
In his nine Southern League appearances, he scored six goals, helping Southampton claim the Southern League title for the fifth time in seven years.
Later career.
In April 1903, he returned to Hearts helping them to take the runners-up position in the Scottish League for the 1903–04 season.
He then returned to the Southern League with Fulham where he helped them take the championship title for the first time in 1905–06 (when Southampton were runners-up) and again the following season.
He left Fulham in 1907 and spent the rest of his career with various London clubs, including Clapton Orient and Leyton, before finishing his career with New Brompton, where he played as a half back.
After the First World War he emigrated to Australia in 1919.

The discovery of Celtic grave sites in Lovavec shows that it was already settled in prehistoric times. The Celtic settlement there had a defensive structure built on Gradišče Hill.
During the Second World War, German forces arrested all of the men in the settlement capable of bearing arms and sent them to perform forced labor.
Mass grave.
Lokavec is the site of a mass grave from the period immediately after the Second World War. The Lokavec Mass Grave () is located in a field 600 m west of the settlement. It contains the remains of five to seven Slovenian civilians murdered around 20 June 1945.

Wesley Mimico United Church

Wesley Mimico United Church is a church in Toronto, Canada. It is located in the neighbourhood of Mimico. The church was created by the union of the former Wesley Methodist Church, Mimico and St. Paul's Presbyterian Church in 1927, of which the Methodist church was the larger partner.
History.
Early Methodists were served by ministers working a 'circuit' of communities the earliest of which west of Toronto was the Cooksville (Mississauga) branch of the (rural) Toronto circuit which began about 1845. Five years later in 1850, with the creation of Etobicoke Township a Mimico branch of the Cooksville circuit was opened which quickly built a church in the original Postal Village of Mimico in central Etobicoke (Dundas at Islington) and identified itself as a Wesleyan Congregation. By 1858 with the building of the railway through today's Mimico and the establishment of a Mimico Station and Post Office with a subdivision plan for a Town of Mimico, a Mimico Branch of Etobicoke central Wesley Church (formerly Mimico) was established using the old Mimico Schoolhouse at Church St (Royal York) across from Mimico Ave. In 1862 the Mimico Branch of the Wesleyan Methodist Church purchased property across the street from the old Mimico Schoolhouse on Church St (Royal York) across from Drummond where a church was built by 1864 establishing Mimico's Wesleyan Methodist Church. Although the 1850s subdivision plan for Mimico had failed, the postal village remaining a rural area, in 1890 a new plan was prepared which eventually led to Mimico becoming a Town and in 1890 the Methodist Church built a Manse on Mimico Ave on the south side just east of Wheatfield.
Of the early Methodists in Mimico the main families were:
The united congregation used the new church built by the former Methodist congregation on Mimico Avenue at Station Road on the west side in the heart of Mimico. Mimico Town Council, which had been meeting in the Mimico Carnegie Library, purchased the old Methodist Church to be the Town Hall while the old Methodist Manse on Queens Ave at Mimico became Hogle's Funeral Home. The first term of union between the two former parishes was for a dual pastorate for the first year and then the election of a new pastor. When the year had ended, one of the resigning pastors, Rev. Fingald, was still the preferred choice for united pastor among the majority of the congregation creating some friction. Those Presbyterians who wished to remain outside the union refounded the Mimico Presbyterian Church and were permitted to have the old Presbyterian Church building at Mimico Ave and Church St (Royal York Rd).
Quickly following the union, Mimico was badly hit by the Great Depression and, like the other churches in Mimico and the Town of Mimico itself, the Wesley Mimico United Church found itself deeply in debt. The congregation celebrated the centennial of the former Methodist church (older and larger than the former Presbyterian Church) in 1964 with the publication of a parish history which also included a history of the Presbyterian church. Wesley Mimico United Church has been faced with great challenges in keeping the church alive as the demographics in Mimico have greatly changed since the town was annexed first to Etobicoke (1967) then to Toronto (1997).

Tibor Gaal de Hatvan

Tibor Gaal (1861–1917) was Nominated Substitute Governor of Fiume (14.07.1897 - 23.11.1897) to replace the Governor, Rezsö báró Abele de Lilienberg, after his resignation. Gaal became several times Governor of Fiume ad interim, providing continuity to the office. Tibor Gaal can be considered as the single most important person at the gubernium in Fiume in the period 1896-1906. This shows, that also the nature of the governors changed: from powerful members of the greatest Hungarian aristocratic families to civil servants, who were mere executors of the governmental decisions.

GU SRZ Vera

GU SRZ Vera The social rehabilitation center for minors GU SRZ Vera (ru: Социально-реабилитационный Центр для несовершеннолетних детей "ВЕРА") is a social organization, which tries to reintegrate Russian children on the margins of St. Peterburgian society.
The organization GU SRZ Vera attempts to give children out of problem families (alcohol and drug abuse, violence, abuse, neglection...) and street children a new home.
The children live in the organization's families together with special helpers, who really care for them.
One of the biggest goals is that the children get used to a daily routine like in a real family. (school, dinner, studies, activities and games)
Street children in St. Petersburg.
St. Petersburg has approximately 5 million registered citizens within the municipal boundaries. There are an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 street children in St. Petersburg, with a greater number sleeping at home most of the nights but avoiding school and living on the street during the day. The general trend appears to substantiate the proposition that those sleeping at home but living on the street tend to graduate to sleeping outside the family residence within a period of 18 months.
This is why it is extremely important that an organization like the GU SRZ Vera exists to improve the situation of Russian children on the margins of society.

Mongolian presidential election, 2009

Presidential elections were held in Mongolia on 24 May 2009. They were contested between incumbent Nambaryn Enkhbayar, supported by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, who had support of the Democratic Party and the opposition parties. Elbegdorj declared himself the victor before the count was official but based on his party's counts. Enkhbayar admitted a narrow defeat shortly after and said that he would respect the result. 
Background.
There had been fears that a close result could lead to civil unrest as happened in the 2008 legislative election, where allegations of vote rigging had sparked street protests and clashes with the police during which five people lost their lives and hundreds were injured. Although, police and army units were on stand-by to contain any protest, the people seemed satisfied with the report of the election monitors in that there was no finding of fraudulent votes.
Candidates.
Presidential candidates were only allowed from parties which had representation in the State Great Khural. The eligible parties were the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), Democratic Party, Civic Will Party and Mongolian Green Party. The MPRP fielded the incumbent president Nambaryn Enkhbayar as its presidential candidate. The Democratic Party chose former prime minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj as their candidate. The Civic Will and Green parties did not field a candidate and instead chose to support Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, the Democratic Party's candidate, thus providing the electorate with a choice between the incumbent or a candidate supported by all of the opposition parties.
Elbegdorj, who served twice as prime minister, campaigned on a theme of anti-corruption and a need for change which proved popular in urban areas. Both candidates' campaigns were dominated by the issue of how Mongolia's mineral wealth should be distributed.
Results.
The United States Senate passed Resolution number 192 supporting Mongolia's democracy and economic development and noting Elbegdorj's election victory on the day he was sworn in on 18 June 2009.

Chirakkadavu Sree Mahadeva Temple

The Chirakkadavu Mahadevar Temple is situated between the Kollam-Theni route of the National Highway about 32 km east of the Akshra Nagari, Kottayam city and 3 km south of Ponkunnam en route to Manimala and Erumely.
History.
Chirakkadava Sri Mahadevar Temple is a very Ancient Temple about 1000 years old and the idol is a 'Swayambhu Siva Lingam which was found under a 'bilva Tree' (Aegle Marmelos). It is believed that the temple was built during the time of the 'Alwars'. There is also a temple tank,from where the mud was dug up to build this temple. Devotees could wash their feet in the water of the streams around the place before entering the temple. Because of the pond ('Chira' in Malayalam ) in the eastern side of the temple the place is called 'Chirakadavu'.
Mythology.
The king who built the temple is said to have built an 'ashram' during his last days, near the vilva tree. He did 'Tapas' there and came to be known as Kuwala (Bilwa) Maharshi. During his 'Tapas' the Lord appeared in his dreams and according to his wish the king continued his penance and is said to have entered heavenly abode.
The temple structure.
The 'Balikallu' of this temple is very big in size. In front of this there is beautiful sculpture and a huge lamp earned out of granite which attract attention. Even though the 'Balikallu' is huge in size the Darshan of the Lord is possible if we stand near the gate of the eastern gopuram. The wooden carvings all round the temple is extremely attractive. . The clean and peaceful atmosphere of this temple attract many devotees. There are 5 poojas, 3 Seeveli and daily 'Navakam' in this temple.
Festivals.
In the past when there were no vehicles and when people used to walk to Sabarimala on pilgrimage, they would halt in this Chirakadavu Temple. ,The Ayyappa devotees considered Chirakadavu Sri Mahadeva as the father of Lord Ayyappan. So several Ayyappa Devotees visit this temple. Even the day every year on Dhanu 24th the pilgrims going to Sabarimala conduct "Ayyappan Pattu" in this temple as they had done in the past.
The "Velakali" of Sri Mahadeva temple performed during the festival time is a very rare item. For this children between the age of five and twenty dressed up as warriors holding swords and shield dance according to the rhythmic beat on the drums. This 'Velathullal' dance is indeed a splendid sight.
"Meenari" is a famous offering of this temple. During the 'Karkidaka Vavu' devotees buy rice from the temple and feed the fish in the temple pond. Many devotees rush to the temple to perform this special offering. People believe that those who perform this 'Vazhipadu' can get cured of many deceases.
'Jaladhara and Mrithinjaya Pushpanjali' are also offered by several devotees to get cure the deceases. Likewise 'Swayamvara Pushpanjali' is offered by several youth irrespective of sex to get better marital relations. It is a very surprisingly experience that these offering turns very positive results.
An important vazhipadu 'Chaturshatam' is performed in this temple which is a rare offering. Due to the traditional rituals followed and the income of the temple it occupies an important place in the Devaswom Board Temples. Also this is one of the very few self sufficient temples of the Dewasom Board.

Otlica

Otlica () is a dispersed settlement in the hills north of Ajdovščina in the Littoral region of Slovenia. It is made up of smaller clusters of the hamlets of Sibirska, Kitajska, Kurja Vas (), and Cerkovna, as well as a number of outlying isolated farms.
Name.
The name "Otlica" is derived from the Slovene adjective "otel" 'hollow'. It refers to a karst sinkhole about 500 meters west of Navrše Hill (857 m); the bottom of the sinkhole leads to the opposite side of the Gora Ridge through a passage 20 meters high and 15 meters wide that opens above a footpath to Ajdovščina. In folk tradition the mountain was therefore referred to as being hollow.
Church.
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to the Guardian Angels and belongs to the Koper Diocese.

Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma

The Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma is one of three federally recognized Shawnee tribes. They are located in Oklahoma and Missouri.
The tribe holds an annual powwow every September at their tribal complex.
Government.
The headquarters of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe are Wyandotte, Oklahoma, and their tribal jurisdictional area is in Ottawa County, Oklahoma. Currently, there are 2,801 enrolled tribal members, with 904 of them living within the state of Oklahoma. 
Glenna J. Wallace is the elected chief, currently serving a four-year term. The Eastern Shawnee Tribe issues its own tribal vehicle tags.
Membership to the tribe is based on lineal descent, that is, the tribe has no minimum blood quantum requirements.
Economic development.
The Eastern Shawnee operate their own housing authority as well as the People's Bank of Seneca, Missouri; the Eastern Shawnee Print Shop; Red Stone Construction Company; Four Feathers Recycling; Longhouse Management, as well as two casinos, a bingo hall, a gas station, a truck stop, and an off-track wagering facility. Their annual economic impact is estimated by the Oklahoma Indian Affairs Commissions to be $164,000,000.
History.
The Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma is an Eastern Woodland tribe, who were once nomadic. They originally came from Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia, Western Maryland, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. In the late 18th century, European-American encroachment crowded Shawnee lands in the East, and one band migrated to Missouri — eventually becoming the Absentee Shawnee. Three reservations were granted to the Shawnee in Ohio by the 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs: Wapakoneta, Lewistown, and Hog Creek. After the Indian Removal Act of 1830 passed, another Shawnee band, who lived with Seneca allies near Lewiston, Ohio, relocated to Indian Territory in the July 1831. They would become the Eastern Shawnee Tribe. Another band, who would become the Shawnee Tribe, relocated to Kansas in August 1831.
The US federal government carved out a reservation for the United Nation of Senecas and Shawnees from Cherokee lands in 1832. A treaty was negotiated between the US and the Seneca and Shawnee in 1867, which made portions of their land available to other tribes and split the Seneca and Shawnee into separate tribes.
The Eastern Shawnee organized as a federally recognized tribe under the 1936 Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act.
Flag.
The tribe's flag displays their tribal seal on a red field, with the name of the tribe in black letters. The seal, resembling a warrior's shield, features a Florida panther. Besides exhibiting the qualities of ingenuity and fierceness, the panther represents Tecumseh, whose name means "panther" in Shawnee. A spear bisects the seal and below is a swan, which represents peace, harmony, and beauty. The four eagle feathers represent the four directions, but originally were five feathers, representing the five original clans of the Shawnee.

Garden at Sainte-Adresse (Monet)

The Garden at Sainte-Adresse is a painting by the French impressionist painter, Claude Monet. (Oil on canvas, 98.1 cm x 129.9 cm). The painting was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art after an auction sale at Christie's in December 1967, under the French title "La terrasse à Sainte-Adresse". The painting was exhibited at the 4th Impressionist exhibition, Paris, April 10–May 11, 1879, as no. 157 under the title "Jardin à Sainte-Adresse".
Monet spent the summer of 1867 at the resort town of Sainte-Adresse on the English Channel, near Le Havre (France). It was there, in a garden with a view of Honfleur on the horizon, that he painted this picture, which combines smooth, traditionally rendered areas with sparkling passages of rapid, separate brushwork, and spots of pure colour.
The models were probably Monet's father, Adolphe, in the foreground, Monet' cousin Jeanne Marguérite Lecadre at the fence; Dr. Adolphe Lecadre, her father; and perhaps Lecadre's other daughter, Sophie, the woman seated with her back to the viewer.
Although the scene projects affluent domesticity, it is by no means a family portrait. Monet's relations with his father were tense that summer, owing to family disapproval of the young artist's liaison with his companion, Camille Doncieux.
Monet called this work in his correspondence "the Chinese painting in which there are flags"; his friend, Renoir referred to it as "the Japanese painting". In the 1860s, the composition's flat horizontal bands of colour would have reminded the sophisticated of Japanese colour wood-block prints, which were avidly collected by Monet, Manet, Renoir, Whistler and others in their circle. The print by the Japanese artist Hokusai that may have inspired this picture, "Turban-shell Hall of the Five-Hundred-Rakan Temple" (1830), remains today at Monet's house-museum at Giverny. 
The elevated vantage point and relatively even sizes of the horizontal areas emphasize the two-dimensionality of the painting. The three horizontal zones of the composition seem to rise parallel to the picture plane instead of receding into space. The subtle tension resulting from the combination of illusionism and the two-dimensionality of the surface remained an important characteristic of Monet's style.
The painting is now in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was bought in 1967, with special contributions given or bequeathed by friends of the Museum.
