Fire the Bastards!

Fire the Bastards! was written by Jack Green and published in his magazine "newspaper" in 1962. It was an acerbic critique of the book reviewing industry. 
Green examined the initial 55 reviews that appeared in response to the publication of William Gaddis's masterpiece "The Recognitions". He discovered that some reviewers either did not read or finish the work. Almost half of the reviews contained factual errors. Many employed the same clichés: "too difficult", "too long", "too negative", "ambitious", "a promising first novel." In one case he found that a critic had purloined part of his review from another review. 
"Fire the Bastards!" appeared in book form in 1992 The publishers did not have the permission of the author to print the text. As the work had never been copyrighted, however, it was in the public domain and no permission was required for publication.

Ted Genoways

Ted Genoways (born 1972) is a poet, a contributing writer at "Mother Jones", and an editor-at-large at "OnEarth" (the magazine of the Natural Resources Defense Council).
Genoways attended Nebraska Wesleyan University (B.A., 1994), Texas Tech University (M.A., 1996), the University of Virginia (M.F.A., 1999), and the University of Iowa (Ph.D., 2007). He has been hailed by the "Minneapolis Star-Tribune" as a "marvelous poet" and by "The Times Literary Supplement" as a "tenacious scholar." His essays and poetry have appeared in "The Atlantic", "Harper's", "The New Republic", "Outside", "Poetry", and the "Washington Post Book World". He is the author of two books of poems and the literary history "Walt Whitman and the Civil War", which, the "Richmond Times-Dispatch" wrote, "fills in a major gap in previous biographies of Whitman and rebuts the canard that Whitman was unaffected by the war and the run-up to it." His book "The Chain: Farm, Factory, and the Fate of Our Food" is forthcoming from HarperCollins. His awards include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, and inclusion in the "Pushcart Prize Anthology" and "Best American Travel Writing". He was editor of the "Virginia Quarterly Review" from 2003 to 2012, during which time the magazine won six National Magazine Awards.
In 2004, librarian Alan Cordle launched the anonymous website Foetry.com, intended to reveal corruption in poetry publishing. The following year, when Cordle was unmasked, Genoways co-authored an article in "The Chronicle of Higher Education" agreeing that poetry contests were in need of reform but cautioned: "Foetry's charges are leveled carelessly and with no acceptable standards of proof; its methods are wrongheaded and dangerous. They divert attention from the merits of the poetry in question, and they give license to its contributors to speculate openly and without accountability on the private lives and alleged public transgressions of writers, judges, and editors." Subsequently, Genoways was appointed to a panel that drafted the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses code of ethics.
In May 2009, Louisiana State University President Michael Martin announced the closure of LSU Press and the "Southern Review." In response, Genoways published "The Future of University Presses and Journals (A Manifesto)" and told the Associated Press that LSU needed to decide: "Do you want to be known as some place that supports the history and culture of your region or some place that has fantastic outside linebackers?" Martin responded that athletics subsidize some academic programs. "In some respects," Martin said, "the press has been saved by the outside linebackers—up to this point." Days later, Ronald D. Liebowitz, the president of Middlebury College, announced the closure of "New England Review," prompting Genoways to publish "Whose Woods Are These?" In September 2009, Northwestern University announced the immediate termination of the editorial staff of its literary journal "TriQuarterly" and the reformulation of the magazine as a student-run, online publication. "The shuttering of "TriQuarterly" and termination of its editorial posts is troubling for a couple of reasons," Genoways told "The Chronicle of Higher Education" in an e-mail. "First, it's a disturbing continuation of a trend begun this spring with the "New England Review" and "Southern Review". It suggests eroding support for literature from our colleges and universities. Second, it's more than a little creepy to see Northwestern describe the dismantling of a major literary institution as a 'reaffirmation' of the university's commitment to publishing. This is the kind of Orwellian doublespeak I'd expect from Dick Cheney, not a university of Northwestern's caliber."
In January 2010, Genoways published "The Death of Fiction?" in "Mother Jones." "Once strongholds of literature and learned discussion in our country, university-based quarterlies have seen steadily declining subscriber bases since their heyday a half-century ago—and an even greater dent in their cultural relevance," Genoways wrote. "All of which has left too many university presidents, already in search of cuts for short-term gain, eyeing their presses and literary magazines and wondering who will miss them if they're gone." The article was reprinted in Colombia's "El Malpensante" and sparked a series of mostly supportive editorials in Australia in journals such as "Harvest" and "Overland". In the United States, however, most responses defended universities and their MFA programs in creative writing. Steve Almond wrote in "The Rumpus": "It seems to me the rise of MFA programs is mostly about people going in search of themselves, people who feel the emptiness of our historical moment, who feel unmoored from family, adrift in a sea of marketing, who seek to find a cure in storytelling. Are some of us needy, entitled narcissists who are in it for the wrong reasons? Yeah." Jay Baron Nicorvo, of the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses, wrote: "If fiction is indeed faltering, the university system isn’t at fault, nor are the navel-gazing writers who come out of it."

Samuel Goldsworthy

Samuel James Goldsworthy (11 February 1855 – 28 September 1889) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Swansea Rugby Football Club. When Goldsworthy died in 1889 he was the first Wales rugby union international to die.
Rugby career.
Goldsworthy gained his first international cap, when he was selected to play for Joe Simpson's Wales, against Ireland on 12 April 1884. Played as part of the 1884 Home Nations Championship, this was Ireland's first international in Wales, and the Welsh selectors chose six new caps to represent Wales after the previous game against Scotland. Of the three new players introduced into the pack, Goldsworthy was the only player to represent Wales more than once, as Hinton of Cardiff and Roderick of Llanelli were dropped the very next game. Wales won the game by a drop goal and two tries to nil, and Goldsworthy was reselected the next season.
Wales only played two international matches in the 1884-85 season, but Goldsworthy played in both. The first was a home game at Swansea against England. Charlie Newman regained his position and the captaincy, but the game is more notable as the first international for future Welsh rugby talisman Arthur 'Monkey' Gould. The selectors again reshuffled the Welsh pack, which saw three new forward caps, including Goldsworthy's Swansea team-mate, Evan Richards. Wales lost the match, but a more stable team was chosen for the away game to Scotland. The first two encounters between the teams had resulted in Scottish victories, therefore the final result of nil-nil was an improvement for Wales, though the press was critical of Wales as the team employed spoiling tactics to kill the game.
Although Goldsworthy is credited as playing for Newport, he was only loaned for a single match.

General Pants Co.

General Pants Co. (also known as "General Pants") is an Australian fashion retailer operating across NSW, VIC, QLD, SA and WA that sells both international and national brands. The retailer specialises in streetwear, denim, skate clothing and surfwear. As of April 2014, the company operates 47 stores.
History.
The Group previously owned the surfwear retail chains Surf Dive ‘n' Ski and Jetty Surf, but the Billabong International company acquired the retail stores, numbering 38 at the time of sale, for "$35 to $45 million" on 1 November 2010—two licensed Billabong stores were also included as part of the sale.
The brand entered into a partnership with the Peer Group Media company in 2010 to launch the Major Label music initiative. As of April 2013, Major Label is a record label that is wholly owned by General Pants Co., and allows artists to maintain ownership of copyright, retain full creative control and receive all of the royalty income that is generated through digital music sales. The label only releases singles and the staff of General Pants Co. act as the label's talent scouts and promoters—artists have been invited to submit their demo recordings at General Pants Co. retails store locations. Guineafowl, Circle Pit and High Highs were the first three acts that signed deals with the label, and Sydney, Australia band Buzz Kull were chosen in the May–June 2013 period.
Controversy.
In 2011, the company published a racy poster advertisement depicting a scantily clad woman with another person's hands unzipping her pants. The Australian Advertising Standards Bureau logged 37 complaints about the advertisement. The company later censored the posters after consumer complaints, covering parts of the posters. Also during this time, the company was criticized for forcing its store employees to wear badges stating "I love sex" and for using naked mannequins in its stores. After consumer complaints, the company covered the mannequins in their stores, but continued to have employees wear the "I love sex" badges. Some female store employees expressed disapproval of being made to wear the badges, with one referring to it as "inappropriate", and another stating that she felt "uncomfortable" wearing the badge, finding it "embarrassing" and "demeaning".

<doc id="21604374" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21604374" title="Typhoon Yagi (2006)">
Typhoon Yagi (2006)

Typhoon Yagi (international designation: 0614; JTWC designation: 16W) was an intense typhoon, the strongest of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, which reached the equivalence of Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Forming out of a tropical depression on September 16, Yagi quickly strengthened as it executed a slow clockwise loop over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On September 19, Yagi strengthened into a typhoon as a subtropical ridge steered the storm towards the west. Two days later, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 910 hPa (mbar). The typhoon gradually weakened as it recurved towards the northeast and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on September 24 and became extratropical the next day. The storm was last noted near the Aleutian Islands on September 27. The typhoon caused severe damage on the island of Chichijima but no injuries were reported as a result of the storm.
Meteorological history.
On September 16, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring an area of convection as a tropical depression about 1,270 km (790 mi) east-northeast of Guam. The depression was located within an area of low to moderate wind shear under an upper-level anticyclone. Flaring convection was noted along the eastern portion of the developing system before the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert later that day. Early on September 17, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 16W. Located within a weak steering environment, the storm executed a clockwise loop while quickly strengthening. Several hours after the JTWC issued their first advisory, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and gave it the name "Yagi"; the name was contributed by Japan, and is the Japanese word for "goat". Late on September 18, the JMA upgraded Yagi to a severe tropical storm while the JTWC classified the storm as a minimal typhoon.
Early on September 19, the JMA upgraded Yagi to a typhoon. After completing the loop, Yagi's track was influenced by a subtropical ridge located to the southeast of Japan. The typhoon continued to intensify and reached its peak intensity on September 21 with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 910 hPa (mbar), making it the strongest storm of the season according to the JMA. At the same time, the JTWC classified Yagi as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph 1-minute winds). On September 22, Yagi passed by the islands of Iwo Jima and Chichijima as the storm recurved towards the northeast. With increasing wind shear, the typhoon began to weaken and also began to undergo an extratropical transition. Late on September 24, the JTWC classified the storm as an extratropical cyclone and issued their final advisory. The JMA kept Yagi as a tropical system for another day as it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Early on September 25, they classified it as extratropical. The remnants of Yagi continued towards the northeast and crossed the International Date Line on September 27. The storm was last noted near the Aleutian Islands.
Preparations and impact.
On September 23, Typhoon Yagi passed directly over the resort island of Chichijima which has a population of about 2,000. The cyclone brought winds up to 210 km/h (130 mph), making it the strongest typhoon in 20 years to hit the island. About 1,000 of the 1,270 homes were without power during the height of the storm. About 150 residents evacuated to local shelters during the storm to escape the high winds and heavy rains. At least one structure was destroyed and numerous others sustained damage. The storm reportedly produced torrential rains, but there are no known measurements. Several homes had their roofs blown off and windows broken. Street lamps were knocked down by the strong winds produced by Yagi. Ferry service for several ports was cancelled for 29 days following the typhoon. Fallen trees knocked down power lines and cut communications. Some homes were reported to have lost water pressure also. The storm passed close to Iwo Jima on September 22, with the island being within the range of 95 km/h (60 mph) winds. No loss of life or injuries were related to Typhoon Yagi.

Alaska Conservation Society

The Alaska Conservation Society was the first grassroots environmental conservation group in the U.S. state of Alaska. It was founded in 1960 to coordinate environmental opposition to Project Chariot, a plan to dig a harbor in Alaska's North Slope with nuclear weapons, and to fight the proposed Rampart Dam project on the Yukon River. Later, the society took a stance on the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, encouraging environmental mitigation during and after its construction, becoming a major factor in environmental policy within the state. The group operated between 1960 and 1993 and was superseded by the Alaska Conservation Foundation, which was founded in 1980 and still operates today.
In 1960, the Alaska Conservation Society was founded by Alaskan environmentalist Ginny Wood and her then husband, Morton "Woody" Wood, at the University of Alaska Fairbanks in College, Alaska to bring together like-minded people in order to better organize opposition to two major projects in Alaska: Project Chariot and the Rampart Dam. The group hoped that its status as an organization "by Alaskans and for Alaskans" would allow its arguments to gain traction in places where speakers from the Continental United States had not. Celia M. Hunter, one of the group's founding members, became its first president.
The conservation society was organized into two groups: Alaska members, who had voting authority, and "associate" or non-Alaska members, who did not. By 1961, one year after its founding, the Alaska Conservation Society had about 300 members, 50 percent of whom were associate members. Thanks to widening coverage granted it due to its opposition to Chariot and Rampart, the group expanded to more than 600 members by 1965. The group's influence grew after Chariot and Rampart were canceled, a fact illustrated by the selection of Alaska Conservation Society president Ernst W. Muller as commissioner of the Alaska State Department of Environmental Conservation in 1975.

Aasiya Zubair

Aasiya Zubair, also known as Aasiya Hassan (June 17, 1972 – February 12, 2009) was with her husband Muzzammil Hassan, the founder and owner of Bridges TV, the first American Muslim English-language television network. In February 2009, she was found dead, beheaded, at the Bridges TV station after her estranged husband turned himself in to a police station and was charged with 2nd degree murder.
Some observers regard the murder an honor killing. Marcia Pappas, New York State president of the National Organization for Women told "The Buffalo News" that "This was apparently a terroristic version of honor killing, a murder rooted in cultural notions about women’s subordination to men.”
Professional life.
Zubair was an architect by training. Worried by the negative perceptions of Muslims, she "felt there should be an American Muslim media where her kids could grow up feeling really strong about their identity as an American Muslim" and came up with the idea for Bridges TV. She also studied for an MBA at State University of New York College at Buffalo from 2007 to 2009.
Zubair was the focus of a cover story in the Vol. 3, Issue 2 (2003) issue of "Azizah" Magazine; her face graced the cover. Journalist Nadirah Sabir wrote about how Zubair conceived the idea of the nation's first Muslim television channel.
Legacy.
In addition to her pioneering work as a broadcaster, Zubair is being remembered as a catalyst for heightened awareness of the issue of domestic violence, especially in the North American Muslim community. Wajahat Ali, acclaimed playwright and founder of GoatMilk, wrote in "The Guardian" that "absolute brutality of Aasiya's murder has served as a clarion call to many American Muslims who have passionately responded to the tragedy with a resounding desire to confront this festering calamity." Imam Mohamed Hagmagid Ali, vice-president of The Islamic Society of North America, stated: "This is a wake up call to all of us, that violence against women is real and can not be ignored. It must be addressed collectively by every member of our community."
A nationwide, unified effort entitled "Imams Speak Out: Domestic Violence Will Not Be Tolerated in Our Communities" commenced in February 2009 asking all imams and religious leaders to discuss the Zubair murder, as well as domestic violence, in their weekly sermon on their Friday prayer services.
On February 7, 2011, Muzzammil Hassan was found guilty of second degree murder for beheading his wife of eight years, Aasiya Zubair.

Troitskaya Tower

The Troitskaya Tower (, literally "Trinity Tower") is a tower with a through-passage in the center of the northwestern wall of the Moscow Kremlin, which overlooks the Alexander Garden.
The Troitskaya Tower was built in 1495-1499 by an Italian architect Aloisio da Milano (known in Russia as Aleviz Fryazin Milanets). The tower has borne several names, including Rizopolozhenskaya, Znamenskaya, and Karetnaya. It received its current name in 1658 from the Troitskaya Coaching Inn (Троицкое подворье) in the Kremlin. The two-story basement of the tower housed a prison in the 16th-17th centuries. There is the Troitsky Bridge, which is protected by the Kutafia Tower and leads to the gates of the Troitskaya Tower. There was also a clock on top of the tower between 1585 and 1812. In 1707, due to a threat of Swedish invasion, the gun slots of the Troitskaya Tower were enlarged to fit heavy cannons. In 1935, the Soviets installed a red star on top of the Troitskaya Tower. Prior to Soviet rule the tower had an icon of the Holy Trinity atop its outward face. Because this tower was the formal entrance for huge Communist Party Congresses the icon was totally removed rather than just plastered over as were those on the Spasskaya and Nikolskaya Towers. 
The Troitskaya Tower is the tallest tower of the Moscow Kremlin. Its current height on the side of the Alexander Garden together with the star is 80 m. Today, the gate of the tower is the main visitors' entrance into the Kremlin.

Lazdynai

Lazdynai () is an eldership in Vilnius, Lithuania, situated on the right bank of the Neris River. It covers area of and has population of approximately 32,000 (according to the 2001 census). The word means "hazel bushes" in Lithuanian.
History.
Since the 1950s, the Baltic states experienced fast population growth and faced housing shortages. When the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev put forth his program of fast residential construction, based on prefabricated panel buildings dubbed "khrushchovkas", it threatened the integrity of the well-preserved historical style of Vilnius. A group of architects struggled against the intrusion of "khrushchovkas" into the historical city center. Eventually they were awarded with the project to build a satellite city outside Vilnius. The chosen area was close to a Polish village of Leszczyniaki or Lazdynai in Lithuanian, situated southeast of old Vilnius.
The architects decided to go against the Soviet architectural style and based their design on study of the architecture of Finland. Initially the authorities monitored the project with suspicion, but eventually it was accepted, and in 1974 the leading figures of the Lazdynai project (architects Vytautas Čekanauskas, Vytautas Brėdikis, Vytautas Balčiūnas, and Gediminas Valiuškis and engineers Algimantas Kleinotas and Vincentas Šileika) were awarded the Lenin Prize in architecture.

<doc id="21604528" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21604528" title="Anne of Armagnac">
Anne of Armagnac

Anne of Armagnac, Dame d'Albret, Countess of Dreux (1402 – before March 1473) was a French noblewoman and a member of the powerful Gascon Armagnac family which played a prominent role in French politics during the Hundred Years War and were the principal adversaries of the Burgundians throughout the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War. Anne was the wife of Charles II d'Albret. One of her illustrious descendants was Queen Jeanne III of Navarre, mother of King Henry IV, the first Bourbon king of France.
Her illegitimate son was Jean de Lescun, known as the "bastard of Armagnac".
Family.
Anne was born in 1402 in Gages, near Rodez, France, the daughter of Bernard VII of Armagnac, Count of Charolais, Count of Armagnac, and Bonne de Berry, who was the widow of Amadeus VII of Savoy. Anne had six siblings, these included John IV of Armagnac, Bernard of Armagnac, and Bonne of Armagnac, wife of Charles, Duke of Orléans. She had three half-siblings from her mother's marriage to Count Amadeus, including Amadeus VIII of Savoy. 
Her paternal gandparents were John II of Armagnac and Jeanne de Périgord, and her maternal grandparents were John, Duke of Berry and Jeanne of Armagnac.
Anne's father was head of the powerful, pro-French, pro-Orléans Armagnac party which played a prominent role in French politics in the early 15th century, and whose bitter opponents during the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War were the pro-English Burgundians, headed by John II, Duke of Burgundy. On 30 December 1415, her father was appointed Constable of France. He controlled the government of the Dauphin Charles (the future King Charles VII of France). On 12 June 1418, he was assassinated in Paris by the Burgundians.
Anne died on an unknown date sometime before March 1473. Her husband Charles died in 1471. The lordship of Albret passed to Alain, the grandson of Charles and Anne; the county of Dreux went to Arnaud Amanieu, but was later seized by Alain. Through Alain, who married Françoise of Châtillon-Limoges (died 1481), Anne was an ancestress of Queen Jeanne III of Navarre, mother of Henry IV. Other notable descendants of Anne of Armagnac included Charlotte of Albret, wife of Cesare Borgia, Marie of Albret, Countess of Rethel, King Charles II of England, King James II of England, and Diana, Princess of Wales.
Marriage and issue.
On 28 October 1417, a marriage contract was drawn up and signed, and less than six months later, on 23 April 1418, Anne married Charles II d'Albret, Sire d'Albret and titular Count of Dreux (1401–1471). He was the eldest son of Charles d'Albret, Constable of France who had been killed at the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415, as co-commander of the French Army. At the time of his marriage, Charles was only the titular Count of Dreux as the lands were in English hands. He would be confirmed as count in 1441 by King Charles VII of France. He served on the royal council of the Dauphin Charles. He participated in the military campaigns of Joan of Arc, including the Siege of Orléans, and was appointed lieutenant of the province of Berry.
Charles and Anne together had seven children:
Illegitimate son.
On an unknown date she gave birth to an illegitimate son, Jean de Lescun. The baby's father was Arnaud-Gillaume de Lescun, Bishop of Aire. The boy grew up to become a celebrated soldier and Marshal of France. Legitimised in 1463, he was granted the title of Count of Comminges by King Louis XI. Jean was a staunch ally and personal favourite of the king before and after his ascension to the throne.
Later years and death.
In 1470, Anne is recorded as having owned "une pierre pour toucher les yeux, enchassié en or" (a stone for touching the eyes, set in gold). It is not known how or where she acquired this "magical stone" which allegedly had healing powers. 
She died sometime before March 1473.

Bill Fraser (footballer)

William Cuthbert Fraser (born 3 July 1907, date of death unknown) was an English professional footballer who played at inside forward for Northampton Town and Southampton in the 1920s and 1930s.
Football career.
Early career.
Fraser was born in Cowpen, near Blyth, Northumberland and played for Blyth Spartans as a junior. He then had a spell in the Army, with the Royal Tank Corps before starting his professional career with Northampton Town in November 1926.
He spent two seasons with Northampton Town in the Third Division South, making 17 league appearances generally on the right wing, scoring four goals as well as providing scoring chances for centre forwards Ernie Cockle and Harry Loasby.
He signed for Aldershot, then in the Southern League, in May 1929 but before he made any first team appearances he was transferred to Second Division Southampton in June for a fee of £200.
Southampton.
He made his "Saints" debut on 14 December 1929, replacing Oswald Littler at inside right in a 1–1 draw at Reading. Fraser made nine appearances in the No. 8 shirt, before being replaced by Jerry Mackie in March.
In the 1930–31 season, Fraser took over at centre forward from the injured Willie Haines after the first match of the season and during a run of thirteen games up front scored six goals before Johnny McIlwaine took over. Fraser then reverted to inside right before being replaced by Laurie Cumming for a few matches before Mackie returned in January, although Fraser played the last five games of the season.
By the start of the following season Mackie had retired, and Fraser played at inside forward until Christmas before injury forced him to miss most of the rest of the season. During his absence, manager George Kay tried eight players at No. 8, of which only Frank Osborne played more than four games.
According to Holley & Chalk, Fraser ""had considerable ability, (but) suffered acutely from nerves in front of crowds"". In July 1932, he was sold to Fulham for a fee of £500 (together with fellow forwards Arthur Haddleton and Bert Jepson) as the Saints were in serious financial difficulties and needed to raise funds.
Later career.
He joined Fulham in July 1932, but was unable to break into the first team with long-serving Jim Hammond hardly missing a match for seven years.
In June 1933, Fraser returned to Northampton Town for one last season, before returning to southern England where he joined Salisbury City in 1934, becoming a player-coach in 1935.

<doc id="21604581" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21604581" title="Language-based learning disability">
Language-based learning disability

Language-based learning disabilities or LBLD are “heterogeneous” disorders associated with young children that affect their academic skills such as listening, reasoning speaking, reading, writing, and maths calculations. It is also associated with movement, coordination, and direct attention. LBLD is not usually identified until the child reaches school age. Most of the children with this disorder find it hard to communicate, to express ideas efficiently and whatever they say can be ambiguous and hard to understand
It is caused by brain damage or a structural development of brain usually at birth. It is often hereditary, and is frequently associated to specific language problems.
There are two types of learning disabilities: non-verbal, which includes disabilities from psychomotor difficulties to dyscalculia, and verbal, language based.
Symptoms.
LBLD consists of dyscalculia which comprises the reading of numbers sequentially, learning the time table, and telling time.
Dyslexia, difficulties associated with written language such as trouble learning new vocabulary, letters and alphabets. Auditory processing disorders can cause trouble understanding questions and following directions, understanding and remembering the details of a story's plot or a classroom lecture, learning words to songs and rhymes, telling left from right, and having a hard time with reading and writing .
Difficulties associated with reading and spoken language involve trouble understanding questions and following directions, understanding and retaining the details of a story's plot or a classroom lecture, nonword repetition, learning words to songs and rhymes, and identifying the sounds that correspond to letters, which makes learning to read difficult
Difficulties associated with motor skills include difficulty telling left from right which is part of motor incoordination, visual perceptual problems, and memory problem
Prevalence.
15-20% of the children in the United States have a language-based learning disability. Of the students with specific learning disabilities receiving special education services, 70-80% have a discrepancy in reading.
Diagnosis.
A speech-language pathologist (SLP), psychologist, social worker, and sometimes neurologist work together or individually to find the proper diagnosis for children with LBLD. Additionally, they evaluate speaking, listening, reading, and written language for children who have LBLD.
Prognosis.
LBLD can be an enduring problem. Some people might experience overlapping learning disabilities that make improvement problematic. Others with single disabilities often show more improvement. Most subjects can achieve literacy via coping mechanisms and education.
Treatment.
Special education classes are the primary treatment. These classes focus on activities that sustain growth in language skills. The foundation of this treatment is repetition of oral, reading and writing activities. Usually the SLP, psychologist and the teacher work together with the children in small groups in the class room.
Another treatment is looking at a child’s needs through the Individual Education Plan (IEP). In this program teachers and parents work together to monitor the progress of the child’s comprehensive, verbal, written, social, and motor skills in school and in the home. Then the child goes through different assessments to determine his/her level. The level that the child is placed in will determine the class size, number of teachers, and the need for therapy.

Leo Geoghegan

Leo Geoghegan is a retired Australian racing driver. he is the elder of two sons of former New South Wales car dealer Tom Geoghegan, who went on to become two of the dominant names in Australian motor racing in the 1960s. While his brother Ian "Pete" Geoghegan had much of his success in touring car racing winning five Australian Touring Car Championship's, Leo spent much of his racing career in open wheel racing cars and sports racing cars. 
Leo also drove Group E Series Production Cars and Group C touring cars at the annual Bathurst 500/1000 endurance race for the Ford Works Team, Chrysler Australia and the Holden Dealer Team.
Leo and Ian Geoghegan drove their Ford Cortina GT500 in the 1965 Armstrong 500 at Bathurst while wearing business suits as part of a sponsorship deal with a Sydney clothing store.
His best finish at Bathurst for the endurance race was second in 1967 driving a Ford XR Falcon GT with his brother Ian. The pair were flagged in first, but a protest by team mate Harry Firth saw the brothers relegated to second after a re-count of the lap charts. Unfortunately for Leo and Ian, just two hours after the start their Falcon ran out of petrol after it had passed the pits. Leo, who in the car at the time, was able to drive through the back gate into the pits to be refueled, which led the lap scorers to mistakenly credit the #53 Ford with a lap it did not complete. The race was then awarded to Firth and his co-driver Fred Gibson. To this day Leo Geoghegan believes that the lap scorers had it correct the first time and that he and his brother should be in the record books as Bathurst winners in 1967.
Other career highlights included victories in the following:
Leo Geoghegan was the principal driver for Chrysler Australia during the period (1970–1972) when the company supported Valiant Pacer and Valiant Charger Series Production touring car teams.
In addition to being a multi-Australian championship winning driver, Geoghegan has the rare distinction for an Australian of having won an international grand prix, specifically the inaugural JAF Grand Prix in 1969 held over 40 laps of the 6 km (3.728 mi) Fuji Speedway. Driving his ex-Jim Clark Lotus 39-Repco V8 in the race held for Formula Libre cars (which included Formula 2 and 1.6 litre cars) by the Japan Automobile Federation (JAF), Geoghegan was part of a large Australian contingent including Alec Mildren Racing with their drivers Kevin Bartlett and Max Stewart (Bartlett driving a 2.5L Mildren-Alfa Romeo V8, and Stewart driving a 1.6L Mildren-Waggott), Garrie Cooper in his own Elfin 600-Repco, and Glynn Scott driving a Bowin P3-Ford Cosworth. The Australian's all qualified at the front end of the grid, with Geoghegan third. He purposefully made a slow start so as not to strip the new gears in his Lotus and drove a steady race. As others fell out, he passed Stewart to take a lead he was not to lose. Geoghegan also set a new F2 lap record during the race with a 1:52.67 for an average of 119.7 mph.
Today Geoghegan is an enthusiastic supporter of historic motor racing.

Carlie Cooper

Carlie Cooper is a fictional character who appears in comic books centered on Spider-Man published by Marvel Comics. She is named after Joe Quesada's daughter. Carlie is friends with Peter Parker (Spider-Man), Harry Osborn, Vin Gonzales, and Lily Hollister. She is one of the first potential romantic interests for Parker following his long relationship with Mary Jane Watson in the "" story arc and eventually becomes his girlfriend for a time.
Fictional character biography.
"Brand New Day".
Carlie Cooper is the roommate and best friend of Lily Hollister; they grew up together, although Carlie was the brighter of the two. As a child, she was also friends with Gwen Stacy. She is an officer of the New York Police Department's Crime Scene Unit. She campaigned vigorously for Bill Hollister, whom she considers a father figure. Her birth father, Ray Cooper, was a well-respected cop who reportedly died years earlier.
While preparing a body found in the river for the medical examiner, she finds a spider-tracer in its mouth, which initiates the police warrant for the "Spider-Tracer Killer". She later discovers that the "Spider-Tracer Killer" is a conspiracy by a group of New York cops, who have planted the tracers on dead bodies to frame Spider-Man in an attempt to turn the public against him. Carlie informs the precinct's sergeant, who is secretly a part of the conspiracy and issues a warrant for her arrest, claiming that she is aiding and abetting the killer. She goes to Lily and Bill Hollister and tells him the truth of the tracer killings. She escapes the police with the help of Menace. Later, Vin finds her and apologizes to her for all he has done.
When Doctor Octopus tries using his Octobot technology to turn New York into his own living weapon, Carlie and Norah Winters investigate who is responsible and through the course of their investigation, stumble upon Doctor Octopus' lair. Unknown to them, Doctor Octopus has already kidnapped J. Jonah Jameson Sr., after learning that JJJ Sr. is going to marry his old love interest, Peter's Aunt May. Spider-Man frees all three of Doctor Octopus's captives with the aid of the Human Torch (Johnny Storm). Afterward, Carlie attends the wedding with Johnny Storm as her date.
Later, Carlie is accused of tampering with evidence when several pieces of evidence collected from three murder scenes mysteriously disappear from the police evidence locker. Spider-Man later discovers that the 'evidence' was actually pieces of the Sandman, which left the evidence locker on their own. Carlie was cleared, but is still looked down on by some fellow officers.
It is discovered that Carlie's father did not die. He speaks to Carlie while she is watching a fight between the Magia family and Mr. Negative's Inner Demons. When Carlie learns that her father was not the good cop he was made out to be, she has him arrested. She then cuts her hair and decides to be more assertive in her life.
After several near misses and almost-dates, Carlie and Peter finally set up a real date at the Coffee Bean. Harry and Mary Jane happen to be there and the two girls get talking, when all of a sudden Lily bursts through the wall, followed by an attacking team of supervillains. MJ asks Carlie to help Lily, who has gone into labor, but they are held captive by Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man manages to save them and rescue Lily's newborn infant from the supervillains. Later, Harry and Mary Jane take Lily to safety, but Carlie was too angry with Lily and instead focuses her energy on trying to find Peter. She is confronted by Tombstone. The police arrive and Tombstone escapes but later doubles back to follow her after discovering that Carlie knows Menace's secret identity. Carlie, Mary Jane, and Lily are able to defeat Tombstone when he attacks them.
Afterward, Peter and Carlie continue to hang out for a time, but Peter lacks the courage to ask her out, leaving Carlie fuming. She gives him an ultimatum and after seeing her at Harry's going-away party, Peter asks her to be his girlfriend. The two kiss and begin dating.
"Big Time".
Peter and Carlie have now been dating for a short while. When Michele Gonzales moves back to Chicago, Peter considers moving in with Carlie but she decides that it is too early in the relationship. It is at this time that Peter discovers Carlie is a roller derby participant, using the sport to help her unleash any pent up anger. Her roller derby name is "Crusher Carlie".
When Peter is called out on a mission with the Future Foundation, he tells Carlie he is going away on a business trip for his new job at Horizon Labs. Carlie is very angry when she finds out that there was no trip. She takes her rage out in the rink which results in her being sent off mid-game for a vicious assault on "Iron Mavis" from the other side. Noticing her bad mood, two of her teammates offer to take her out for a night on the town. After getting drunk, Carlie decides to get a tattoo of the Green Goblin's insignia to spite Peter, knowing his opinion of Norman Osborn (as he had murdered Peter's first girlfriend Gwen Stacy). However, she changes her mind and gets a tattoo of Spider-Man. She is worried that the tattoo will make things awkward between herself and Peter, but he assures her that it is not the case.
During the "Return of Anti-Venom" storyline, Carlie correctly deduces that the new Wraith is her police captain Yuri Watanabe using a mask Mysterio created that could impersonate the face of the late Jean Dewolff since only they and Spider-Man knew about it. This becomes more obvious when she visits evidence storage and learns of a mysterious incident that supposedly destroyed the mask with Watanabe being the last visitor beforehand. Having secretly placed her cell phone into Watanabe's pocket earlier and following her, Carlie's suspicions are confirmed. Rather than turn Watanabe in like she previously did to Vin and her father, Carlie agrees to keep it secret and suggests that Watanabe needs to improve on covering her tracks for her own safety.
"Spider-Island".
During the events that lead to the "Spider-Island" storyline, Carlie confronts Peter about his connection to Spider-Man, and accepts his explanation that he designs all of Spider-Man's technology., (which was essentially the truth). She later gains spider-powers due to the Jackal's genetically-altered bedbugs, with the addition of organic webs. However, her mutation, like the millions of others in New York City, turns her into a monstrous spider-being. She and the rest of the civilian population were eventually cured when Spider-Man uses Doctor Octopus' octo-bots to disperse the antidote. When she returns to normal, Carlie breaks up with Peter after deducing that he is Spider-Man, furious that she has been lied to once again. She and Peter are on a sort of truce as she requires Spider-Man's help in order to investigate the death of a gothic teen who died from falling from a great height and was ruled as a suicide. Carlie works the case without police approval, putting her at odds with Chief Pratchett. Shortly after the case is resolved, Carlie, still conflicted over her feelings for Peter, confides in Peter's best friend and ex Mary Jane despite her initial anger over MJ also knowing Peter's identity.
"Superior Spider-Man".
Around the end of the "Dying Wish" storyline, Carlie Cooper catches Doctor Octopus breaking into the NYPD to reclaim his golden Octobot. She tries to stop him, not knowing that Doctor Octopus is really Peter Parker's mind in Otto's body. Peter/"Otto" tries to calm her down, but she shoots him, causing him to defend himself with a tentacle, the bullet ricocheting off his arm and shooting through Carlie's shoulder, to his shock. She is taken to the hospital, where she recovers.
Later, Mary Jane and Carlie are surprised by some footage showing the Superior Spider-Man shaking hands with Mayor J. Jonah Jameson, who came to thank Spider-Man, for stopping the Sinister Six. They both agree that things are weird. Carlie mentions that things have been weird since her run in with Doctor Octopus, but doesn't explain why. Mary-Jane confides in her that she and Peter seem to be getting back together, shocking Carlie. When Mary-Jane tells Carlie that the Superior Spider-Man broke it off with her just when they were getting back together, Carlie decides to "go back to work", wanting to know what really happened to "Peter".
It is heavily implied that Carlie knows who Superior Spider-Man really is, but she is keeping it to herself until she can find proof. Soon while lurking in the shadows while Captain Wantanabe interviews police witnesses to Superior Spider-Man killing Massacre at point blank, Carlie appears to have also confided in one mysterious person about her speculation, this person was later revealed to be Wraith.
Carlie and the Wraith, later follow a lead how the new Spider-Squad is being funded, as it is not being financed by Mayor Jameson's initiatives. After investigating the foreign bank accounts of Super villains, it is revealed that Carlie has stumbled upon proof that an account belonging to Doctor Octopus is funding the new Spider Squad. Therefore, she has made the connection of her suspicions that Superior Spider-Man is Doctor Octopus in Peter Parker's body.
Later, Carlie mourns Peter being buried under Doctor Octopus' headstone. She respects and apologizes for not believing him and makes Doctor Octopus pay for what he had done. The grave collapses to discover that Doctor Octopus' body is empty. Before continuing, Carlie is kidnapped by Menace and brought to the Goblin King's lair. She grabs Carlie's journal and gives it to the Goblin King where he learns about Superior Spider-Man's secret. With all the evidence of Doctor Octopus' mind being in Spider-Man's body, the Goblin King still tries to interrogate Carlie about why she left Spider-Man's true identity out of her journal. He tries to take it out of her, but she refuses to reply, prompting Menace to take over the interrogation. The Goblin King sprays the Goblin Formula on Carlie after she still refuses to divulge the true identity of Superior Spider-Man, causing her to writhe in agony. The Goblin Formula used on Carlie begins to take effect transforming her into one of them and the Goblin King nicknamed her "Monster". When prompted to reveal the Spider Man's identity by the Goblin King, Carlie questioned who Goblin King was to which he replied that he is Norman Osborn. Carlie did not buy it and asked him to remove his mask to prove the fact. The Goblin King however wanted Carlie to prove that she was a real member of the Goblin army first before doing so. Monster joins Menace into attacking Hobgoblin's henchmen Ringer, Steeplejack, and Tumbler. Steeplejack ends up shooting Monster only to be viciously attacked by her in response earning her place in the Goblin family after Goblin Knight kills Steeplejack.
At the time when Goblin Underground was causing havoc in Manhattan, Monster attacks Parker Industries where Otto gets her away from the other people inside. Superior Spider-Man was shocked to discover that Monster is Carlie. Superior Spider-Man deploys Living Brain to fight Monster while he and Sajani Jaffrey flee inside. He tells Sajani to split up wanting to direct Monster's attention to him. He succeeds and Otto fights Monster in a closed room. He lands a kick which breaks the earpiece on Monster and she informs him that because of this, the Goblin King would not be able to listen to them. She states that she needs Otto or Peter's brains to fix this situation and fix her as well before she loses control. Telling Otto to hurry, she says that Otto has no idea what the Goblin King has planned for him and this world. Carlie also mentioned that she is unsure of the Goblin King's claim of being Norman Osborn. Sajani continues to work on the cure for the Goblin Serum when Carlie gets loses control while waiting for it, Wraith breaks free from the grip of Living Brain and makes her way to where Sajani and Carlie are. In the brief fight, Wraith is unable to see Carlie as her technology has been hacked by the Goblin King to render any goblin undetectable, Sajani completes the cure as Wraith restrains Carlie long enough for Sajani to inject the cure into her to change back into human form, with Carlie falling unconscious afterwards. Wraith leaves Carlie in Sajani's care as she heads off.
In the aftermath, as she was still recovering from the effects of the Goblin serum, Carlie has one last talk with Mary Jane where she has decided to leave New York since she realized that she will always remain as a target as long as she remains close to Peter Parker or Spider-Man and wants to move to a less dangerous place where she could work as a police forensic officer without having to deal with any supervillains.

Kingdom of Artsakh

The Kingdom of Artsakh () is the modern name given to the medieval eastern Armenian state on the territory of Artsakh (present-day Nagorno-Karabakh), Gardman and Gegharkunik. Contemporary sources referred to it as the Kingdom of Aghuank or Khachen. The royal house of Artsakh was a cadet branch of the ancient Syunid dynasty and was named Khachen, after its main stronghold. The kingdom emerged when John-Senecherib (Hovhannes-Senekerim) acquired the royal title in 1000.
The monarchs of Artsakh maintained an internationally recognized sovereign status, though in the early 13th century they accepted Georgian, then Mongol suzerainty. They lost the royal title after the assassination of Hasan-Jalal (1214–1261) by the Ilkhanid ruler Arghun Khan, but continued to rule Artsakh as a principality, which from the 16th century comprised five Armenian melikdoms and lasted until the early 19th century. The descendants of the kings of Artsakh played a prominent role in the history of Artsakh as far as the 20th century.

Frank Lukis

Air Commodore Francis William Fellowes "Frank" Lukis CBE (27 July 1896 – 18 February 1966) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A veteran of World War I, he first saw combat as a soldier in the Australian Imperial Force at Gallipoli. In 1917, Lukis transferred to the Australian Flying Corps and flew with No. 1 Squadron in the Middle East, where he was twice mentioned in despatches. A member of the Australian Air Corps following the war, he transferred to the fledgling RAAF in 1921, and became the first Commanding Officer of the newly re-formed No. 3 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, in 1925.
Lukis went on to lead No. 1 Squadron in the early 1930s, and was promoted to group captain in 1938. Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire the same year, he was in charge of RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, during the early years of World War II. He later held forward commands in the South West Pacific theatre, including Northern Area (later North-Eastern Area), for which he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and No. 9 Operational Group (later Northern Command). Lukis also served on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body, as Air Member for Personnel. After retirement from the Air Force in 1946, he became a manager with Australian National Airways, and was active in veterans' associations. He died in 1966 at the age of sixty-nine.
Early life and World War I.
Born on 27 July 1896 in Balingup, Western Australia, Lukis was the son of grazier William Fellowes Lukis and his wife Jean. He was educated at The High School, Perth, and later worked on the family farm. In October 1914, he joined the Australian Imperial Force as part of the 10th Light Horse Regiment, the only such regiment raised in Western Australia. Ranked corporal, Lukis sailed from Fremantle aboard A47 "Mashobra" on 17 February 1915, seeing combat first at Gallipoli and then in Egypt. At Gallipoli, the 10th Light Horse went into action in the Battles of the Nek and Hill 60, before being withdrawn in December and redeployed to Egypt. There it took part in the campaign against the Turks in Sinai, including the Battle of Romani.
Lukis was commissioned as a second lieutenant in July 1916 and promoted to lieutenant in December. On 25 February 1917, he transferred to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) and was posted to No. 1 Squadron (also known until 1918 as No. 67 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps), operating in Sinai and Palestine. He undertook reconnaissance missions as an observer in Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s from April to September 1917. In January 1918 he completed pilot training and began flying fighter and ground attack sorties in Bristol Fighters. He was twice mentioned in despatches for distinguished service with the AFC in the Middle East, the first gazetted on 16 January 1918, and the second on 12 January 1920. Lukis finished the war a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain, and returned to Australia on 5 March 1919.
Between the wars.
With the disbandment of the wartime AFC, Lukis joined the short-lived Australian Air Corps early in 1920. He transferred to the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force in March the following year. Ranked flying officer (honorary flight lieutenant), he was one of the original twenty-one officers on the Air Force's strength at its formation, and became popularly known as "Luke". In February 1922, he surveyed the air route between Perth and Port Augusta, South Australia. He took part in one of the embryonic service's earliest public flying displays in May that year, when he and another pilot flew Airco DH.9s in mock dogfights with four Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s during the New South Wales Aerial Pageant at Victoria Park, Sydney. On 21 January 1925, he married Florence St Aubyn Allen at St Mary's Anglican Church, West Perth; the couple later had two sons. The previous year, Lukis had been best man at the wedding of Squadron Leader Frank McNamara, the AFC's only Victoria Cross recipient in World War I.
No. 3 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, on 1 July 1925, with Lukis as its Commanding Officer (CO). Over the next week, operating DH.9s and S.E.5s, the unit established itself at the Air Force's newest base, RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. Alerted to a forthcoming inspection by the Chief of the Air Staff, Group Captain Richard Williams, Lukis had the foresight to engage in a speedy beautification program at the base, arranging delivery of pot plants and shrubs; the notoriously fastidious Williams concluded the inspection by pronouncing himself "happily surprised ... that so much had been done so quickly". For the duration of his tour as No. 3 Squadron commander, Lukis doubled as CO of the base. He was promoted squadron leader on 2 July 1927, and handed over command to Squadron Leader Harry Cobby on 13 January 1930. Lukis served as CO of No. 1 Squadron from 1930 to 1934, interrupted in 1931 by a posting to Britain to attend RAF Staff College, Andover. Raised to wing commander, he was placed in charge of No. 1 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, in 1936. He held command of No. 1 Flying Training School at Point Cook from January 1938 to November 1939, receiving appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1938 King's Birthday Honours, and promotion to group captain in July the same year.
World War II.
The CO of RAAF Station Laverton from December 1939, Lukis was made acting air commodore and posted to Townsville, Queensland, on 8 May 1941 as the inaugural Air Officer Commanding Northern Area. Described by Major General Lewis H. Brereton, commander of the US Far East Air Force, as "a dark, husky, energetic man with a keen sense of humour" who was very much "alive to the situation", Lukis was in charge of air defence on the north coast of Australia. His task was complicated by the poor standard and quantity of available equipment, with only CAC Wirraways as fighters. In January 1942, Northern Area was split into North-Western Area and North-Eastern Area, Lukis remaining in charge of the latter as a temporary air commodore. The following month, he warned higher command of the poor state of preparedness and low morale of Australian Army troops at Port Moresby, New Guinea, due to lack of air cover and apparent lack of interest from government echelons. In March, seventeen P-40 Kittyhawks of No. 75 Squadron, newly formed under North-Eastern Area Command, were deployed to the area; this unit would shortly distinguish itself in the Battle of Port Moresby.
By the end of April 1942, Lukis' forces consisted of three squadrons (general purpose, transport, and fighter) at Townsville, one general purpose squadron at RAAF Station Amberley in southern Queensland, and four squadrons (three general purpose and one fighter) at Port Moresby. Posted to RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, as Air Member for Personnel, he handed over command of North-Eastern Area to Group Captain (later Air Commodore) Harry Cobby on 25 August. On 23 March 1943, Lukis was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for the "courage, enterprise and devotion" that he had displayed at North-Eastern Area. As Air Member for Personnel, he occupied a seat on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body that was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. In this position he clashed with Group Officer Clare Stevenson, Director of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, over plans to reduce the number of female officers in technical roles. Stevenson was forced to apologise to Lukis for going over his head to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to voice her opposition to the scheme; nevertheless, cuts to these positions did not eventuate.
In November 1943, Lukis took over No. 9 Operational Group (No. 9 OG), the RAAF's main mobile formation in the Pacific at the time, after its commander, Air Commodore Joe Hewitt, was sacked by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, over allegations of poor discipline and morale. The change in leadership dismayed the US-led South West Pacific Area Command, whose senior air officers, Lieutenant General George Kenney and Major General Ennis Whitehead, did not hold Lukis in the same high regard that they did his predecessor. For the next two months, No. 9 OG supported the Allied invasion of New Britain. On 17 January 1944, Lukis mounted an operation with a force of seventy-three aircraft comprising Bristol Beaufort light bombers and Kittyhawk and Spitfire fighters, which was the largest strike undertaken by the Australians to that date. However it encountered no opposition, and Lukis voiced his concerns to Whitehead that the "mopping up" role he had been assigned was costing his fighter pilots the opportunity to engage in air-to-air combat.
As the Pacific conflict shifted further north, No. 9 OG's operational tasking lessened and it became colloquially known in the RAAF as the "Non-Ops Group". When ordered to transfer one of his fighter wings, No. 73, to the Admiralty Islands for convoy escort in late February, Lukis complained directly to Kenney that it was a waste of resources, but was overruled. The rest of No. 9 OG became a garrison force in New Guinea, and was renamed Northern Command on 11 April 1944 to better reflect this new status; its original mobile strike role was taken over by No. 10 Operational Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force). Lukis was again considered for the position of Air Member for Personnel when the incumbent, acting Air Vice Marshal Adrian Cole, was removed from his position following accusations of drunkenness at an RAAF Headquarters meeting in November 1944. In the event, Lukis remained in charge of Northern Command. The following April, he took command of No. 2 Training Group in Melbourne, and he held this post for the rest of the Pacific War.
Later life.
With the end of hostilities, Lukis was summarily retired from the RAAF along with a number of other senior commanders and veterans of World War I, ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers. According to RAAF historian Alan Stephens, the Air Board believed that Lukis "had not taken a role commensurate with his seniority during the war, a strange accusation to make against a man who had been Air Member for Personnel and AOC of the RAAF's most important operational group in the Southwest Pacific Area". He was officially discharged on 2 May 1946. Employed by Australian National Airways (ANA) after leaving the Air Force, Lukis become airfield manager at Essendon, Melbourne. He took over the airline's Canberra office in 1952, before joining a stockbroking firm in 1957, the year that ANA merged with Ansett Airways to become Ansett-ANA. Active in veterans' organisations, he served as president of the Air Force Association in Victoria during 1947–48, and helped found the Commonwealth Club in Canberra in 1954. Survived by his wife and children, Frank Lukis died in Melbourne of cancer on 18 February 1966, and was cremated.

Pékin Fine Arts

Pékin Fine Arts (Chinese: 北京艺门), is a contemporary art gallery in Beijing established in 2005, with a Hong Kong branch gallery opened in 2012. It was listed by "The New York Times" as one of the "top museums and galleries" in Beijing, and listed by Forbes as one of the ten galleries in Beijing from which to buy Chinese art.
History.
The gallery was established by Bostonian Meg Maggio (Chinese: 马芝安), a prominent contemporary art dealer. Maggio is a United States lawyer and member of the New York and Massachusetts bars, moved to Beijing in 1986, when, she said, "people thought it was like going to Mars". She lived there till 1990, then moved to Hong Kong, where she worked as an attorney first for Exxon Chemical, then for international British law firms, McKennas, and Sinclair Roche, advising United States, Asian and European clients. In 1995, Maggio moved back to Beijing to work as a senior attorney in the newly opened Beijing office of NY law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. From 1998 until 2006, she ran the Courtyard gallery in Beijing, one of the first galleries to open in China. She said in 2005, "The days when China and Chinese art were considered as just exotic are over."
In November 2005, Maggio established her own Pékin Fine Arts gallery and opened it in Caochangdi Village, which is on the northeastern edge of Beijing and has become a centre for art since leading artist, Ai Weiwei, opened a studio and gallery there in 2000 for himself and friends. Maggio said initially when Ai and his colleagues moved there, "We all thought they were cuckoo," as it was a place that was "basically the countryside—really far away." However, as the 798 District, the center of art in Beijing, attracted increasing numbers of tourists and boutiques, galleries began to move instead in Caochangdi Village, a quiet location lined by birch and pine trees. Pékin Fine Arts was set up in a complex designed by Ai of simple, low buildings, whose gray brick cladding is reminiscent of the traditional alleys (hutongs) found in old Beijing.
In March 2007, the gallery was part of the "internationally renowned line-up", including White Cube and Max Lang, at the first Gulf Art Fair, sponsored by the Dubai International Financial Centre. Pékin Fine Arts showed a solo display of abstracts by Chinese artist Aniwar, as well as "one of the biggest surprises" at the fair—a car painted with colored spots by Damien Hirst and owned by Charles Saatchi; it was priced in the region of $2 million. A gallery associate, Irene Hochman, a "buying scout" for Saatchi, said, "We just brought it over to see what the interest is."
After returning from the fair, Maggio set off for New York to attend the contemporary Asian art sale at Sotheby's, accompanied by three artists and some Chinese clients; she that it had become a typical occurrence to be in Dubai one week, Beijing the following week, and New York the week after that. 73 out of 310 works at the auction failed to sell (they were "bought in"). Maggio said that the works were "by great artists, and, as far as I'm concerned, the only reason they were bought in was because the estimates were so high." 
In May 2007, the Saatchi Gallery opened a Mandarin language web site for Chinese artists to show their work. Maggio said that an important aspect of the site was a chatroom and that the site was "a wonderful way to introduce Chinese artists to as many other artists and curators and students as possible around the world."
On 31 May 2007, Poly Auction Co held their inaugural sale in Beijing, 48 of the 65 contemporary works reaching or exceeding their high estimate, part of a pattern, where Chinese contemporary art had risen ten times in value within a year, but leading to accusations that the prices were "crazy" and part of a bubble market. Maggio, Poly Auction's foreign adviser, said that people could no longer expect to find "bargain shopping in the third world" and this was causing the negative response. She said that the highest prices at the Poly Auction sale were achieved by the "living father of Chinese modernism", Wu Guanzhong, then 85 years old, who had devoted his life to painting and deserved to achieve high prices.
In January 2008, the "Voroduo" installation by Boston architectural firm Office dA opened at Pékin Fine Arts in one of its main galleries. The installation was based on Voronoi mathematical diagrams and was made from 125 sheets of plastic, which were cut into 600 interlocking acrylic cells to form a structure twisted back on itself. Nadir Tehrani, a co-founder of Office dA, said he was not an artist and did not consider the piece to be art, but related to architectural practice and was calisthenics.
Two other exhibitions were being held at the same time in the gallery, linked, said Maggio, because "The artists are all working out problems—in terms of materiality and exploring the language of abstraction—and these works are the products of working out those problems." American painter and digital artist, Perry Hall, in "Livepaintings" exhibited videos of paint which had been modified by the application of chemicals; he also used sound waves to change the appearance of paint mixtures. Suling Wang, a London-based Taiwanese painter who has studied with Peter Doig, exhibited works on paper and large scale paintings, which combined aspects of the Chinese tradition of landscape with Western abstraction.
Clients and artists.
In August 2007, Maggio entertained a museum group at the South Silk Road restaurant in Soho New Town, one of six eating places opened by artist Fang Lijun for major collectors and curators from Seoul, Hong Kong and the West to meet the elite of the art world, over dishes such as caterpillar fungus chicken soup in steam pot. Maggio said, "China is a country where relationships are best built over a good meal." 
Clients can be collectors from South Korea or European corporations who have business interests in China. Charles Saatchi is one of her clients. She said that Chinese clients have a strong interest in art from India, Korea and Singapore. Maggio is a consultant for the Gagosian Gallery. She sourced paintings by Li Songsong, Chen Wenji, and Ai An for Juan Van Wassenhove's apartment in the Sanlitun district of Beijing.
Maggio said that the Chinese market cannot now be easily distinguished from the Asian art market or the international art market in general, and that it can encompass Korean artists exhibiting in China and Chinese artists who live in New York. She said that Chinese art has evolved to encompass many varying ideas and aesthetics, and that it is "such a cliche to say that it is direct or too political." Pékin Fine Arts shows an international collection of artists; these include photographer Liu Zheng, and O Zhang.
Pékin Fine Arts is located at 241 Caochangdi Village, Cuigezhuang Xiang.
Pékin Fine Arts recently expanded into Hong Kong, opening a second gallery space in Hong Kong's Wong Chuk Hang district.

Navarro made his debut under the ring name "Ángel del Barrio" (Spanish for "Angel of the Neighborhood"). Navarro worked for just over two years as Ángel del Barrio before losing his mask to Hator as a result of a "Luchas de Apuestas", or bet match. A month later Navarro had his hair shaved off after losing another "Luchas de Apuesta" to Hator. Following the mask and hair loss Navarro began working as "Randy" and later on as "Vaquero I" (Spanish for "Cowboy I").
In 2006 Navarro began working regularly on the main Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) shows, adopting a new ring persona; A masked personal called "Mictlán", based on the myhtis of the Aztec Underworld. Over the next two years Mictlán worked in the first or second matches on the show without direction until he started a storyline feud with Dragón Rojo, Jr.. The storyline between the two build to a "Luchas de Apuesta" between the two masked men. On August 8, 2009 Mictlán lost to Dragón Rojo, Jr. and was unmasked. Following the mask loss CMLL has promoted Mictlán a bit higher in the rankings, giving him more of a metrosexual, stripper ring persona. Following his unmasking Mictlán won the hair of Loco Max on December 12, 2008 in a "Luchas de Apuestas" match. On August 18, 2009 Mictlán defeated Misterioso, Jr. to win the Occidente (Western) Light Heavyweight Championship, overcoming both his opponent and interference from Máscara Mágica, Misterioso, Jr's cornerman. After the match Mictlán revealed that he was wrestling with an injured elbow but did not let that stop him from competing. He also made a "Luchas de Apuestas" challenge for a "hair vs. hair" match with Máscara Mágica. In the weeks after Mictlán's title victory Máscara Mágica repeatedly attacked Mictlán before matches, claiming that he "did not want to see Mictlán dance". Máscara Mágica pinned Mictlán in several tag and six-man matches leading up to their "Lucha de Apuesta" on September 17, 2009 at "Arena Coliseo" in Guadalajara. Mictlán won the first fall after Máscara Magica was disqualified for excessive violence. Mágica won the second fall but Mictlán picked up the third fall to win the match. Afterwards Máscara Mágica took the clippers from the official and shaved his own hair off.
Personal life.
Navarro is the younger brother of professional wrestler El Dandy and the nephew of El Texano. He is also the cousin of wrestlers El Texano, Jr. and Súper Nova (III).

Isaac Newton in popular culture

Sir Isaac Newton was an English scientist, mathematician, natural philosopher, theologian and one of the most influential scientists in human history. His "Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica", published in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. In this work, Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus.
Because of the resounding impact of his work, Newton became a scientific icon, much like Albert Einstein after his theory of relativity. Many books, plays, and films focus on Newton or use Newton as a literary device. Newton's stature among scientists remains at the very top rank, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists in Britain's Royal Society (formerly headed by Newton) asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton or Albert Einstein. Newton was deemed the more influential. In 1999, leading physicists voted Einstein "greatest physicist ever;" Newton was the runner-up.
Newton in poetry.
English poet Alexander Pope was moved by Newton's accomplishments to write the famous epitaph:
Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night;
God said "Let Newton be" and all was light.
English poet Sir John Squire amusingly satirised this:
It could not last; the Devil shouting "Ho! <br>Let Einstein be!" restored the "status quo".
This passage is from William Wordsworth's "The Prelude", in which he describes a marble statue of Newton at Trinity College, Cambridge:
And from my pillow, looking forth by light<br>
Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold<br>
The antechapel where the statue stood<br>
Of Newton with his prism and silent face,<br>
The marble index of a mind for ever<br>
Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.
Newton in literature.
Books featuring Newton as a plot element.
"(..) Sir Isaac Newton, renowned inventor of the milled-edge coin and the catflap!"<br>
"The what?" said Richard.<br>
"The catflap! A device of the utmost cunning, perspicuity and invention. It is a door within a door, you see, a ..."<br>
"Yes," said Richard, "there was also the small matter of gravity."<br>
"Gravity," said Dirk with a slightly dismissive shrug, "yes, there was that as well, I suppose. Though that, of course, was merely a discovery. It was there to be discovered." ...<br>
"You see?" he said dropping his cigarette butt, "They even keep it on at weekends. Someone was bound to notice sooner or later. But the catflap ... ah, there is a very different matter. Invention, pure creative invention. It is a door within a door, you see."
Newton in films.
The Newton-Leibniz Calculus Controversy was the subject of a 2010 film "The Invention of Calculus".
Newtonmas.
As an alternative to celebrating the religious holiday Christmas, some atheists, skeptics, and other non-believers have chosen to celebrate December 25 as "Newtonmas". Celebrants send cards with "Reasons Greetings!" printed inside, and exchange boxes of apples and science-related items as gifts. The celebration may have had its origin in a meeting of the Newton Association at Christmas 1890 to talk, distribute gifts, and share laughter and good cheer. The name "Newtonmas" can be attributed to The Skeptics Society, which needed an alternative name for its Christmas party. Another name for this holiday is Gravmas (also spelt Gravmass or Grav-mass) which is an abbreviation of "gravitational mass" due to Newton's Theory of Gravitation.
Newton's birthday was December 25 under the Old Style Julian Calendar used in Protestant England at the time, but was January 4 under the New Style Gregorian Calendar used simultaneously in Catholic Europe. The period between has been proposed for a holiday season called "10 Days of Newton" to commemorate this.

Paul Dilascia

Paul DiLascia (1959 – 3 September 2008) was an American software developer, author, web developer and programming journalist and one of the most celebrated columnists for MSDN. 
He grew up in Manhattan, where he went to a special high school for smart children. After that he went to Columbia University and MIT, where he got a bachelor's degree in Mathematics. After that he studied at Harvard for a year working on a PhD, also in Mathematics. There he realised that where in mathematics it was quite hard to contribute something useful, this was not the case in software. At that time it was possible to contribute right away. 
In the 1980s he worked for Infocom as a programmer, first on a Zork interpreter for the Commodore 64, and later on the ill-fated Cornerstone database product.
In 1992 he published his influential book, Windows++, one of the first serious attempts at encapsulating the complexity of Windows 3.X programming with C++ classes. 
For 13 years he wrote the C++ Q&A column, aka "C++ At Work" for MSDN Magazine.
According to Matt Pietrek (MSDN magazine columnist):
"Paul was an amazing technical writer, and one with the gift of adding humor to what could be an otherwise dry topic. Eric Maffei once told me that without humor, MSJ would read like "Microsoft Pravda". Paul's contributions were a big part of why it wasn't."
Paul DiLascia died suddenly on the evening of September 3, 2008. He was only 49 years old at the time. Many present day C++ and MFC programmers still use his reusable modules and pieces of code containing his famous article/code comment: 
"If this code works, it was written by Paul DiLascia. If not, I don't know who wrote it".

Joan Almedilla

Joan Almedilla (born Joan Richelle C. Almedilla on September 19, 1973) is an international film and theater actress, composer, and singer who has starred as 'Kim' in the Broadway musical "Miss Saigon".
Biography and early career.
Almedilla was born on September 19, 1973 to Agapito and Rosario, whose roots are from Bohol and Cebu in The Philippines.
According to an interview by AsianWeek on June 1, 2000, Joan, who wanted to sing, did not want to be an actress. But through her love of music she stumbled upon the much-coveted role of 'Kim' in the Broadway production of "Miss Saigon." The rest, as the saying goes, is history.
Almedilla came to the United States in 1993 to pursue a college education. Little did she know that her formal voice training and previous performing experience while in The Philippines would lead her on the road to stardom.
As a child, Joan enjoyed competing in many talent contests in The Philippines. 
Unlike most theater actors who spend years honing their craft, Almedilla never had formal drama instruction, yet she is now one of the most sought-after actresses in the theater. She eventually landed the role of 'Fantine' in "Les Misérables," billed as one of the longest-running and the "world's most popular" musical.
Almedilla's career took off when she landed the role of 'Kim' in the Broadway production of "Miss Saigon" (1995–1997). She then moved on to portray the role of 'Fantine' on the Third National Tour of "Les Miserables" (1999–2000 and 2005–2006). Her other credits include: 'Soul Girl' on the Broadway National Tour of "Jesus Christ Superstar" (2002–2004); and 'Woman' in "Songs for A New World" (2005) at the Rubicon Theater, which had been nominated for several Ovation Awards including Best Ensemble Cast.
In 2007, Almedilla starred in the famous "Here Lies Love" staged at Carnegie Hall's main theater, the Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage, with nearly 3,000 music patrons and enthusiasts in attendance. "Here Lies Love" presented Imelda Marcos meditating on events in her life; from her childhood spent in poverty to her rise to power, and her ultimate departure from the presidential palace. In particular, the production looked at the relationship between Imelda and a servant from her childhood, Estrella Cumpas, who appeared at key moments in Imelda's life. Almedilla was the only Filipino in the cast, provided the vocals for Mrs. Marcos, with Byrne for Ferdinand Marcos and Ninoy Aquino. Byrne, who also has an Oscar and a Golden Globe, is best known as a founding member and the principal songwriter of the new wave band Talking Heads.
Almedilla had the privilege of reciting two poems ("Wonderment" and "A Hill in the Land of Moriah") composed by Pope John Paul II and the United Nations. Among the attendees were former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and New York's Cardinal Egan. She is presently playing the role of Himiko Hamilton, the lead in "Tea, With Music" at East West Players (running until December 9th, 2012.) 
She has directed several fundraisers including: "Hope For A New World" (benefiting the victims of Tsunami disasters in South Asia) and "Give A Child Hope" (together with Places Please and World Vision to benefit The Children of Rwanda). 
Almedilla supports Broadway Cares: Equity Fights Aids, and The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
Personal life.
Almedilla is married to Filipino American film director Charles Uy, whose film about 9/11, "Yasin," is an official entry in the short film category of the Berlin International Film Festival. Uy is known for his much-awarded film thesis "Waiting in the Wings," which was honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, and The Directors Guild of America.

<doc id="21604965" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21604965" title="Movement and Surveying Radar">
Movement and Surveying Radar

In open pit mining operations, people and equipment are constantly at the base of a steep, man-made slope (the highwall or pit-wall). Instances where this slope fails resulting in a rock or earthfall can result in loss of life, injuries and damage or destruction of equipment (see mining). It has been found that, over the last few hours preceding a slope failure, there is nearly always a small movement, or alteration in the movement pattern in the rock face of that section.
The system is intended to monitor mine slopes to detect this movement and generate a warning of impending failure (slope stability), so that personnel and equipment may be removed prior to the failure. The radar element provides very accurate, real-time, all weather slope movement measurements with sub millimetre detection ability, and is able to provide an alarm if the detected movement reaches a predetermined level, thereby permitting evacuation of the unstable area, and enhancing safety.
All radar measurements are fully geo-referenced to an accuracy that allows easy integration with standard digital terrain mapping (DTM) tools.
A second function of the Movement and Surveying Radar is to determine the absolute range to the electromagnetic reflective centroid of an area on a body of material or geographical feature. This functionality, combined with the accurately surveyed position of the measurement origin of the Movement and Surveying Radar and the positioning system’s angular measurement information, may be used to generate survey data of geographical features such as mine walls and rubble dumps. The survey data collected may be used for applications such as the calculation of material removal volumes.
A Movement and Surveying Radar combines simultaneously the execution of slope stability and surveying measurements, which together with high-speed external data links makes it a near real-time tool for mining safety, planning and productivity improvement.

Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve (Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota,January 21, 1933) is an American author, with a focus on books about Native Americans for children.
The daughter of James Driving Hawk, an Episcopalian priest, and Rose Driving Hawk (née Ross), Virginia was raised on the Rosebud Reservation. She graduated from St. Mary's School in Springfield, South Dakota and received her bachelors and masters degrees from South Dakota State University (Brookings) where she met her husband. She has published over twenty books on South Dakota history, Native American history, poetry, fiction and non-fiction works for children, as well as one about her female ancestors, "Completing the Circle".
Virginia is a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe (Sicangu Lakota). She studied journalism at the South Dakota State University. She is the mother of three, grandmother of five, and great-grandmother of one. It is because of her children that she realized the need for children's books about Native Americans in a contemporary context rather than a "savage" myth of the past. Her husband is from a Norwegian family, so she wrote "The Trickster and the Troll," to bring together the two cultures of her children, for them and for her grandchildren. The story follows the Lakota trickster Iktomi and a Norwegian house troll across the plains as they search for the troll's lost family.
She was an English language teacher and counselor in several public schools, editor at the Brevet Press in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and she has been a member of several organizations. She and her husband also ran an antiques business before retiring. She still writes today; her latest book is "The Christmas Coat: Memories of My Sioux Childhood", published in 2011 and named in the Smithsonian Magazine's Best Children's Books of 2011. She still resides in South Dakota with her husband.

Chicks on Speed Will Save Us All

Chicks on Speed Will Save Us All is an album released in 2000 by the then Munich-based artists Chicks on Speed (COS). The album is considered to epitomize the German electroclash movement, as well as Eurotrash culture.
Album information.
Although "The Un-Releases" was released first, "Will Save Us All" is considered to be COS' official debut album because the former's content included bits of sound collages, taped conversations and moments in-between takes ("The Re-Releases Of The Un-Releases" was released later in 2000). "Will Save Us All" included four of the five singles released by the group since 1998 and combined cover songs such as "Warm Leatherette" and "Mind Your Own Business" and original songs. COS' cover of Malaria!'s "Kaltes Klares Wasser" was a subsequent single. COS collaborated with a diverse range of producers and DJs from the German techno scene to create the album.
The album was well received by critics, who praised in particular the reinterpretations of various 80s songs and the strength of COS' original compositions such as "Glamour Girl" and "Little Star" and took note of the implications of the group's politics that were largely manifested through a deliberate emphasis on style over substance in terms of both music and image.

González-Sinde studied Classics at the Complutense University of Madrid and did a Masters in Cinema Scriptwriting at the AFI Conservatory in Los Angeles.
She was president of AACCE ("Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematográficas de España", "Spanish Academy of Arts and Cinematographic Sciences") since 2006 until April 2009, when she was appointed Minister of Culture. Her appointment was received with anger and rejection by the Spanish Internet Community, due to González-Sinde's opposition to P2P file sharing and the alleged conflict of interest due to her ties to the film industry. A strict anti-piracy law enacted in Spain in December 2011 has become known colloquially as Ley Sinde, or the Sinde Law, as she was seen as the primary backer of the measure.
She is the daughter of the academy's founder, José María González-Sinde, Sr. Her brother, José María González-Sinde, Jr., is also involved in the film industry.
Controversy.
On April 2009, Ángeles González-Sinde was appointed Culture Minister. This sparked a movement against her from the Spanish Internet users community, represented by the "Asociacion de Internautas" (Internet Users Association). They stated that she was unable to fulfill correctly the needs and obligations of her position because of a conflict of interest, as she had personal ties with businesses involved in the film industry and consequently would not be impartial. Moreover, Spanish law 5/2006 of April 10, 2006 regulates conflicts of interest among high-ranking positions in the Spanish government.

Raj Rajaratnam

Raj Rajaratnam (; born June 15, 1957) is a Sri Lankan American former hedge fund manager and billionaire founder of the Galleon Group, a New York-based hedge fund management firm. On October 16, 2009, he was arrested by the FBI on allegations of insider trading, which also caused the Galleon Group to close. He stood trial in "U.S. v Rajaratnam" (09 Cr. 01184) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and on May 11, 2011 was found guilty on all 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. On October 13, 2011, Rajaratnam was sentenced to 11 years in prison and fined a criminal and civil penalty of over $150 million combined.
As of January 14, 2013 Rajaratnam is incarcerated at Federal Medical Center, Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts, an administrative facility housing male offenders requiring specialized or long-term medical or mental health care. Rajaratnam's release date is July 4, 2021.
Background and career.
Rajaratnam is an ethnic Sri Lankan Tamil born in Colombo in the Dominion of Ceylon, present-day Sri Lanka. His father was the head of the Singer Sewing Machine Co. in South Asia. According to the newspaper "The Island", he attended S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, though other sources say he attended S. Thomas' Preparatory School, Kollupitiya. Rajaratnam’s family emigrated to England in 1971, "sensing that the Sri Lankan ethnic situation would get more violent". Rajaratnam attended Dulwich College in London and later studied engineering at the University of Sussex, and then earned an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1983. He is married with three children and maintains residences in Connecticut, New York, Georgetown (DC) and Florida.
According to "Forbes" magazine, Rajaratnam is a self-made billionaire hedge fund manager. He was the 236th richest American in 2009, with an estimated net worth of $1.8 billion. He was the 262nd richest American in 2008, with an estimated net worth of $1.5 billion. In 2009 he was the richest Sri Lankan-born individual in the world.
Rajaratnam started his career as a lending officer at Chase Manhattan Bank where he specialized in business loans to technology companies. He joined the investment banking boutique Needham & Co. as an analyst in 1985, where he focused on the consumer electronics industry. He rapidly rose through the ranks, becoming the head of research in 1987 and the President in 1991, at the age of 34. At the company's behest, he started a hedge fund – the Needham Emerging Growth Partnership – in March 1992, which he later bought and renamed "Galleon".
His hedge fund was valued at $3.7 billion in 2009, down from a peak of $7 billion in 2008. According to a 2009 investor letter his $1.2 billion Diversified Fund had a net annualized return of 22.3%. Rajaratnam has been featured among the elite US money managers in a book called "The New Investment Superstars." Initially, Rajaratnam primarily invested in technology and healthcare companies. He said that his best ideas came from frequent visits with the companies in which he invested and from conversations with executives who invested in his fund.
After Rajaratnam's arrest, Galleon received requests from its investors for the withdrawal of $1.3 billion, which caused the fund to close. In a letter dated October 21, 2009, Rajaratnam informed his employees and investors that he intended to wind down all the hedge funds of the Galleon Group. Investors received the full balance of their initial investments, plus profits, in January 2010.
Contributions to charitable and political organizations.
In November 2009, Rajaratnam pledged to donate $1 million to help with the rehabilitation of the LTTE combatants. He has donated generously to clear land mines in the war-affected areas in Sri Lanka. He recalled his visits to the mine-impacted areas of Sri Lanka and underscored the humanitarian toll that mines have taken. Recalling his encounter with a young child in Kilinochchi who had lost both legs to a land mine, Rajaratnam stated that this particular image that is etched in his memory “made it an easy decision to write the check.” He helped Sri Lankans recover after the 2004 Tsunami. Mr. Rajaratnam was also a contributor to various causes that promoted development in the Indian subcontinent and programs that benefited low income South Asian youth in the New York area.
According to the Federal Election Commission, Rajaratnam has made over $118,000 in political contributions in the past five years. He has also contributed to the Democratic National Committee and various campaigns on behalf of Barack Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Charles Schumer, and Robert Menendez.
Controversy.
Rajaratnam has contributed $3.5 million to the Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation (TRO), a group whose assets were frozen by the USA due to its alleged close connections to the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) which are proscribed as a terrorist organization in 32 countries. TRO's offices were raided by the FBI in 2006 but the organization was never charged with any wrongdoing.
The Sri Lankan government has stated that Rajaratnam had contributed for several years of the Sri Lankan Civil War to the LTTE with millions of US dollars and that, as a consequence, he was under investigation in Sri Lanka. However, the senior military official could not give specific details about the alleged contributions to the LTTE. Rajaratnam had recently pledged a $1 million to rehabilitate former LTTE combatants.
Conviction and imprisonment for insider trading.
On Friday October 16, 2009, Raj Rajaratnam was arrested by the FBI and accused of conspiring with others to engage in insider trading in the stock of several publicly traded companies. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara put the total profits in the scheme at over $60 million, telling a news conference that it was the largest hedge fund insider trading case in United States history. Jim Walden, an attorney for Mr. Rajaratnam, said his client is innocent and would fight the insider-trading charges.
Rajaratnam allegedly profited from information received from:
It was reported that Rajaratnam, Goel and Kumar were all part of the class of 1983 from Wharton business school.
The Sri Lankan stock market fell sharply after Rajaratnam was arrested on insider trading charges in October 2009. Sri Lanka's Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the active stock trading of Raj Rajaratnam with a view of identifying any insider trading.
It was alleged that Rajaratnam also conspired to get confidential information on the $5 billion purchase by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway of Goldman preferred stock prior to the September 2008 public announcement of that transaction. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that a former member of the board of directors of Goldman Sachs and former McKinsey & Company chief executive Rajat Gupta told Rajaratnam about Berkshire's investment before it became public. Gupta stood to profit as would-be chairman of Galleon International, a co-founder of New Silk Route with Rajaratnam, and as a friend of Rajaratnam. In March 2011 Gupta was charged in an administrative proceeding by the SEC. Gupta maintained his innocence, countersued, and won dismissal of the administrative charge, but was then arrested on criminal charges.
On May 11, 2011, Rajaratnam was found guilty on all 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. On October 13, 2011, Rajaratnam was sentenced to 11 years in prison by Judge Richard Holwell. To date, this was the longest prison sentence ever handed out for insider trading. The thirteen other defendants connected to Rajaratnam's case received prison sentences averaging approximately three years each.
Just before Rajat Gupta's arrest in October 2011, Rajaratnam was reported to have said that the prosecutors had wanted him to wear a wire and tape his conversations with Gupta. "It was Rajaratnam’s understanding that were he to plead guilty and wear a wire, he might be offered a sentence of as little as five years. With good behavior, he could be out in 85 percent of that time," the report continued. Rajaratnam had not yet at that point, however, cooperated with prosecutors and had already received his 11-year sentence. There was no sign that he would cooperate at any future point.
Rajaratnam is serving his 11-year sentence in Ayer, Massachusetts. His appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was argued in October 2012 by Patricia Millett, who was subsequently nominated to a federal Court of Appeals judgeship herself.
Film.
Billion Dollar Raja.
108 Production has announced a film entitled "Billion Dollar Raja," inspired by the story of Raj Rajaratnam and described as "an investigative financial mafia drama inspired by the true story of Galleon Group founder Mr. Raj Rajaratnam, his network of Wall Street honchos, big corporate insiders, employees and a prosecution team determined to punish those involved in the most complex insider trading case in history through secret wire-tap recordings." The film will be written and directed by Nayan Padrai and produced by Sheetal Vyas. Indian actor Mohanlal has been approached to play the lead role of Raj Rajaratnam.
Prince of Malacca.
Chandran Rutnam is set to direct a film "Prince of Malacca" depicting the arrest of the Raj Rajaratnam.

Research into use

Research Into Use (RIU) is a programme of the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the government department that manages Britain's aid to developing countries. RIU is part of the DFID Strategy for Research on Sustainable Agriculture (SRSA), which aims to get new technologies to poor farmers, and help governments to make better policies.
The RIU Programme is designed to put the results of agricultural and natural resources research into use to reduce poverty, promote economic growth and mitigate environmental problems – and thus contribute to the Millennium Development Goals.
Aims of the Research Into Use Programme.
RIU has the twin aims of maximizing the livelihood-improving potential of research in the natural resources sector and capturing lessons about best practice in achieving this for different social groups and in different environments.
RIU takes an innovations systems approach. The programme works to improve the flow of information between those who have or ‘push’ information and those who want or ‘pull’ information in national and regional innovation systems. This means strengthening the 'pull' for knowledge by enabling poor producers to articulate and satisfy their demand for knowledge, technology and other resources. It also means building the capacity of all partners in the science community, government, private sector and civil society to work together more productively.
The RIU Programme builds on the DFID Renewable Natural Resources Research Strategy 1995 to 2005, which funded research on crops, livestock, fisheries, forestry, post-harvest issues and natural resource management. Much of this research has a great deal of unfulfilled potential to impact on poverty. RIU aims to realize that potential and to learn lessons that can be incorporated into future research for development.
Outputs.
RIU is delivering three major outputs to achieve its aims:
Firstly, RIU is enhancing access to research outputs to greatly benefit the poor. Output 1: Significant use of RNRRS and other past research results increased.
Secondly, RIU is gathering concrete evidence of what works and why. Output 2: Research-into-use evidence generated.
Thirdly, RIU is working to embed innovation for the poor in development agendas. Output 3: Research-into-use lessons on policies and practices gathered and shared.
Target regions.
RIU focuses on sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, and works in:
Innovation Challenge Funds.
The RIU Innovation Challenge Funds aim to stimulate uptake of research results. Organizations in target countries submit proposals for adapting and using research results. Those that are successful set up coalitions or other partnerships with end-user groups and intermediaries such as farmer organizations, extension agents, NGO networks and policy makers. The emphasis is on action research, or learning by doing.
Guiding principles.
The RIU Programme is guided by four principles:
1. Working with existing national and international processes, and development assistance arrangements to meet national demands. In Africa this includes aligning RIU to the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme process.
2. Working through existing programmes, partnerships and institutions. RIU will not establish separate initiatives.
3. Making maximum use of existing information and systems, and of national and regional capacity, in its work.
4. Learning and disseminating lessons on the impact of getting Research Into Use to benefit poor people.
Management.
The RIU Programme was a DFID programme managed under contract by NR International until December 2011 when the contract transferred to the University of Edinburgh until completion in March 2013.
Timeframe and budget.
The RIU was commissioned in July 2006 as a 5-year programme. The inception phase ran from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007. Full implementation runs from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2011. The RIU is funded by the Department for International Development (DFID), UK. The total budget is £37.5 million.

Darwin Porter

Darwin Porter (born September 13, 1937, in Greensboro, NC) was the son of Hazel Lee Phillips, a fashion designer, and Paul Suggs, an attorney. His stepfather, Numie Rowan Porter, adopted him and changed his last name.
He became America’s leading travel writer, producing numerous titles, mostly for the Frommer Guidebook series, over a 50-year career span. In the 21st Century, he became a pop culture journalist-historian, the leading celebrity biographer in America in terms of volume of works produced.
Early life.
He grew up in Western North Carolina, moving to Miami Beach when he was ten years old. His mother was the wardrobe mistress and secretary for the renowned entertainer, Sophie Tucker. As a young boy in Ms. Tucker’s home, Porter first met many of the stars he would later write about—Marilyn Monroe, Ronald Reagan, Victor Mature, Richard Widmark, Frank Sinatra, and Elizabeth Taylor, plus an array of other stars.
 He attended the University of Miami, graduating in 1959. He was the editor of the award-winning student newspaper, "The Miami Hurricane", and the President of the Florida Intercollegiate Press Association. 
 As a student journalist, he obtained major interviews, most notably with Eleanor Roosevelt. She befriended him and was instrumental in recommending him for a scholarship. He did interviews with Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, along with Tallulah Bankhead, Ted Williams, Bette Davis, Ethel Merman, Adlai Stevenson, and Vice President Richard M. Nixon.
Career.
In 1958, he joined "The Miami Herald" as an entertainment writer, book reviewer, and columnist. Later, he was appointed Bureau Chief of The Miami Herald in Key West, where he was a frequent visitor to Havana, writing about the growing tensions between the United States and Cuba. Once, he was taken into the hills to meet a guerilla fighter, Fidel Castro. In Key West, he conducted extensive interviews with Harry S Truman, who had made Key West his winter White House during his presidency.
 In Key West, he was befriended by playwright Tennessee Williams, who introduced him to a number of stars, such as Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando, and Paul Newman, as well as such literary figures as Truman Capote, Christopher Isherwood, and Gore Vidal. Porter would later write biographies of these personalities. In 2014, he would publish a biography, "Pink Triangle", devoted to Williams, Capote, and Vidal.
 In New York in 1961, Porter was named vice president of Haggart Associates at the age of 24. Working with the company president, Stanley Mills Haggart, a noted interior designer, author, and magazine editor, they produced some of TV’s most watched commercials, specializing in hiring movie stars to sell their products. Haggart had the Pepsi-Cola account, the soft drink promoted by Joan Crawford. They also produced 20-minute musical shorts starring such entertainers as Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong.
 A world traveler, Porter, in 1969, wrote the first ever Frommer guidebook. (Before that, the series produced a $-a-Day series.) In terms of volume, he would write more travel guidebooks than all others, over a 50-year span. In the 1970s and 80s, and into the 90s, the Frommer guidebook series was the market leader. They books were published, over the years, by Arthur Frommer, Inc.; Simon & Schuster; and John Wiley & Sons.
 Porter also wrote and updated subsequent editions of travel guides for Lufthansa, American Airlines, TWA, Iberia Airlines, Greyhound, British Airways, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, American Express, TAP Air Portugal, Air France, and Alitalia.
 Porter is also a novelist. His first novel "Butterflies in Heat" was reviewed by James Kirkwood, Jr., the Pulitzer prize-winning author of A Chorus Line, with “Darwin Porter writes with an incredible understanding of the milieu—hot enough to singe the wings off any butterfly.” "Butterflies in Heat" was later adapted into the film, "Tropic of Desire".
 Other novels include "Marika", based in part on information gleaned from Porter’s long association with German and Austrian stars such as Hedy Lamarr, Marlene Dietrich, and Greta Keller, the leading chanteuse of Europe during the 1930s. He also wrote "Venus", a novel suggested by the life of the acclaimed diarist, Anaïs Nin. Other novels include "Blood Moon", "Hollywood’s Silent Closet", R"azzle-Dazzle", "Midnight in Savannah", and "Rhinestone Country".
 In the 21st Century, for Blood Moon Productions, Porter has produced more Hollywood celebrity biographies than any other journalist, concentrating on legendary stars and personalities such as Marilyn Monroe, Howard Hughes, Elizabeth Taylor, Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart, Steve McQueen, Marlon Brando, Katharine Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Linda Lovelace.
 He has written biographies of singers Michael Jackson, Merv Griffin, Frank Sinatra, and two biographies based on politicians—J. Edgar Hoover and The Kennedys.
 Porter is also the author of four books on film criticism and has written a series of exposés as part of Blood Moon’s Hollywood Babylon series.
 These biographies, based on compilation of firsthand, orally transmitted histories, have illuminated aspects of Hollywood history previously unknown to the general public. Some of Porter’s works have been serialized by major broadsheet newspapers in the U.K., including "The Mail on Sunday". "The Sunday Times" (London) defined Porter’s biography of Marlon Brando "(Brando Unzipped)" as “Lurid, raunchy, perceptive, and certainly worth reading…One of the ten best show-biz biographies of the year.”
 As a biographer, Porter has won numerous awards from, among others, the New England Book Festival, the Hollywood Book Festival, the Los Angeles Book Festival, the San Francisco Book Festival, and the Beach Book Festival.
 His biographies and travel guides have been translated into many languages, including French, Italian, Dutch, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Chinese.
 Most of his biographies were published by Blood Moon Productions (www.BloodMoonProductions.com), a New York City-based press directed by former New York Times reporter Danforth Prince, and distributed through the National Book Network (www.NBNbooks.com) Blood Moon originated as the Georgia Literary Association in 1997, adopting its current name in 2004.

James Mink

James Mink was a black man who became a respected millionaire businessman in Toronto, Canada in the 1840s when slavery was rampant in the United States.
Mink's story was told in the loosely autobiographical made for TV movie , starring Lou Gossett, Jr. as James Mink and Kate Nelligan as his wife. Afro-American actress, Ruby Dee, played a significant part as did Michael J. White., however several discrepancies exist.
In reality, Mink was the eldest of 11 children of United Empire Loyalist Johan Herkimer's slave, named Mink. James Mink became a millionaire, along with his brother, George. Both started hotels, liveries and coach services, first in Kingston Ontario. Then James moved to Toronto in the 1840s, while his brother remained in Kingston Ontario. They would transport travellers between Toronto and Kingston, which was then the capital city of Upper Canada; a colony of Great Britain. The brothers would transport their passengers to the other's city by meeting at the halfway point in Brighton Ontario; exchange passengers and get fresh horses, and then return home with the passengers. They also earned the respect of the public and ended up being assigned the mail runs; George would take the mail from Kingston Ontario to Montreal, while James took it to Kingston and other towns in the area of Toronto. James' hotel was used as a voting station in Toronto elections and the mayor hired his coach service for his inauguration in the 1850s. Farmers outside Toronto would stay at his hotel when they came to town to sell their produce at the farmer's St. Lawrence Market, not far from the hotel. Many Torontonians used his livery service, as did the Sheriff of the city.
Both brothers started the first public transit system in their respective cities; James took people from the Town of Yorkville to downtown's St. Lawrence market.
James Mink married a white Irish immigrant, Elizabeth, as did many free Black men at that time. The Irish girls often arrived in Canada penniless and without families so priests often arranged marriages with single men who were making a decent living. James and Elizabeth had a daughter, Minnie, but in the movie she was called, "Mary." In real life, they may have had some other children. Because they were of mixed race, they believed in the races "blending together as naturally as two tributaries forming into one river." (a common theme amongst many Free, Canadian Blacks at that time when slavery still plagued America). In other words, many as today, believe in intermarriage. One theory is that many Black people of the day felt that there was better opportunity for their children if their skin was lighter, but this could be disputed. The political climate of the day in Toronto had the Irish Protestants protesting for equal rights, talk always was about slavery in America, especially after the American Revolution when the British lost the war. They would often chastise the Americans for having as their slogan, "All men were created equal ... and entitled to the unalienable rights of life, liberty and freedom," while denying it to women, aboriginals and Black people. Canada had abolished slavery in the 1830s.
It was not unusual for millionaires of the day to arrange marriages; so James Mink offered a substantial dowry for his daughter's hand; some research report about $10,000, which would have bought a city block in 1852! A man named William Johnson married their daughter, Minnie, (a nickname given to a daughter with the same name as her mother and records found in the archives of University of Toronto's Victoria College) Johnson took the dowry and Minnie on a honeymoon to the United States, where he then sold her into slavery to a Virginian tobacco plantation owner.
Virginia tobacco plantations had used up their fertile soil in the 1850s and were on the verge of bankruptcy so they began to breed their chattel, which sadly included their slaves. They'd sell their off-spring to the labour-intensive southern states like South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana and Georgia, where cotton was a big resource. Perhaps that is why she was sold for $1,500 - also a significant amount in those days!
Contrary to the movie, research reveals that the real James Mink learned of his daughter's plight and went through a lot of red tape to get the British to buy her back on his behalf. Census records show that she was living with a son on Mink's farm on the Don and Danforth Road in Toronto in 1862. (now Danforth Road between Pape and Carlaw Streets).
In the movie version Mink, pretending to be his wife's slave, traveled to the American South and was successful in rescuing Mary/Minnie and several other slaves. This was created for dramatic effect to explore the then male dominated relationships in marriage as well as slavery in America, but it wasn't played out as written in more accurate researched and more dramatic original screenplay.
Like all American movies, it had to end with a happy ending, making James Mink look like a hero. Contrary to the movie, he never arranged the marriage of his daughter for his own political gain. He never was interested in political office but his brother, George, in Kingston Ontario, was nominated as an alderman during an election. A transcript was found at Queen's University where George told voters in a passionate speech that he didn't put his name forward but some white people did to challenge a particular candidate and it was a racially motivated move. He never sought political office either. But American screenwriters made it appear that James Mink married his daughter off like this for his own personal, financial gain. Not so!
Some research on the true story exists in the Toronto Public Research Library as well as the Archives for the Province of Ontario, but they are not all correct. More accurate facts exist in "Landmarks of Toronto."
History and the movie stand apart, but both are intriguing stories for their own purposes. In real life, after Minnie returned to Toronto, it appears she had a son; she lived with her family and then an arsonist's fire was set to the Mink hotel and livery. They lost everything. Eventually, trains transported people and so George and James Mink's business fizzled away. James Mink died in 1866 and it appears he was living alone near today's Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto. He is buried in the Riverdale Cemetery in the area of Toronto known as Cabbagetown.

Rzucewo culture

The Rzucewo (also "Rutzau" or "Bay Coast culture", , 2700 BC) was a local archaeological culture of late Neolithic. It centered at the coast of the Bay of Gdansk (Danzig) and Vistula Lagoon (Frisches Haff) and extended north to the Curonian Lagoon and up to Šventoji settlement in Lithuania. It is either named after the adjacent bays, or after an archeological site in the village of Rzucewo (Rutzau) near Puck. 
The Rzucewo culture was a hybrid of pre-Indo-European Narva culture, Globular Amphora culture and Corded Ware culture. Traditionally Rzucewo was identified as a variation of Corded Ware culture; however newest research suggests that the culture formed before Corded Ware. This culture specialized in exploitation of marine resources, and existed in parallel to its mother culture for some time. Rzucewo settlements, consisting of characteristic houses reinforced against sea erosion, were located along the coast and further east. The Rzucewo people had domesticated cattle, pigs, some goats, but did little cultivation and engaged in fishery and hunting, especially of seals, then numerous along the Baltic coast. The Rzucewo culture people produced and widely traded amber decorative items in specialist shops. A large number of amber artifacts was found in Juodkrantė. 
Formerly, this culture was interpreted as the earliest detection of the Balts. Tracing formation of the Balts to Rzucewo culture would explain differences between Western and Eastern Balts and their languages. Typically Polish and German archeologists place the culture just on the coast, while Lithuanian and Latvian scientists extend it much further inland describing coastal settlements as a cultural and economic center and inland villages as a periphery.

Marin le Bourgeoys

Marin le Bourgeoys (c. 1550–1634) was a French artist and inventor, known for inventing the flintlock mechanism that was used on weapons for over two centuries.
Life.
Marin le Bourgeoys was born into a noted artisan family in Lisieux, in Normandy, France. He was probably initially trained as a painter. He later attained fame not only as an artist, but as a gunsmith, inventor, and luthier. In 1598, his talents attracted King Henry IV, and he was appointed Valet de Chambre in the Royal Court. In 1608, he was granted rooms in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre. He produced artwork, firearms, air guns, crossbows, and movable globes.
He continued in royal service under the reign of King Louis XIII. Sometime between 1610 and 1615 it is believed that he created the first true flintlock weapon. His basic design was copied and soon spread over all of Europe. His weapons were considered works of art, and Louis XIII kept many of them in a private collection. The King also gave them to favored courtiers and highly esteemed visitors.
One feature of Marin le Bourgeoys' lock was that it had a half cocked position, from which the weapon could be loaded but would not fire. This feature proved to be much safer than earlier designs, and was widely implemented as other gunsmiths copied the flintlock.
Marin le Bourgeoys' design was standard in firearm use until the 1840s, when it was finally replaced by percussion lock systems.

Berkemeyer

A Berkemeyer is a drinking glass with a wide, flared bowl dating from the 15th century Germany and the Netherlands, and still made today. They have a characteristic green or yellow colour caused by iron impurities in the sand used for glass production. The thick, hollow stem is covered with prunts providing a secure grip for hands greasy from feasting, similar to the römer.
Berkemeyers were originally carved from birch tree branches ("berkemei") and were provided with lids. The prunts on the stems of glasses reminded drinkers of the rough bark of the wooden beakers, hence the association. They were frequently depicted in still lifes of table settings by the Dutch masters in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Haridama Magic Cram School

Plot.
Apprentice sorcery students, Kokuyo and Harika, require contact with an obsidian orb to effectively use their yin-yang magic. Due to this disadvantage, they are considered inferior to "normal" sorcery students. Discouraged by his status, Kokuyo often skips his teacher and adopter, Sekiei's class to show off his magical skills on the street. Harika, on the other hand, is studious and often has to drag Kokuyo back to class. Kokuyo's rival, Nekome, a third-level sorcerer, arrives to taunt Kokuyo about his obsidian status and to insult Sekiei for adopting an obsidian baby and attempt to train him into a sorcerer. When Harika slaps him for doing so, Nekome tries to gain Harika's affections although she is oblivious to his attempts. Kokuyo and Harika work together in the third-level sorcery exam to inadvertently defeat a first-level monster and pass the exam spectacularly.
Production and release.
"Haridama Magical Cram School" is written and illustrated by Atsushi Suzumi. The manga was serialized in Kodansha's shōnen magazine, "Monthly Shōnen Sirius" ending the serialization at 5 chapters. Kodansha released the manga's single "tankōbon" on December 22, 2005. The manga is licensed in North America by Del Rey Manga, which released the manga's single "tankōbon" volume on May 20, 2008. The manga is licensed in Taiwan by Sharp Point Press, which released the manga's single "tankōbon" on March 6, 2007. Atsushi Suzumi comments that "Haridama Magic Cram School" was meant to be written in "short manga form". However requests from editors to make the manga "something a bit longer" resulted in the manga being a short series.
Reception.
Mania.com's Nadia Oxford comments that "the split between swords and magic, the discovery of hidden powers and the usual lessons about teamwork and friendship" in the manga is similar to J.K.

Business cycle accounting

Business cycle accounting is an accounting procedure used in macroeconomics to decompose business cycle fluctuations into contributing factors. The procedure was introduced by V. V. Chari, Patrick Kehoe and Ellen McGrattan but is similar to techniques introduced earlier. The underlying premise of the procedure is that the economy has a long run trajectory which is perturbed by various frictions. These are called wedges and the earliest version of the procedure includes a productivity wedge, a labor wedge, an investment wedge and a government consumption wedge. Business cycle accounting decomposes fluctuations in macroeconomic variables, such as GDP or employment, into fluctuations of each of these wedges (and their combinations).
Business cycle accounting has been done for various countries and various periods of time. The procedure suggests for the U.S. after World War II most fluctuation in GDP is due to fluctuations in the productivity and labor wedges.

Hadrian's Library

Hadrian's Library was created by Roman Emperor Hadrian in AD 132 on the north side of the Acropolis of Athens. 
The building followed a typical Roman Forum architectural style, having only one entrance with a propylon of Corinthian order, a high surrounding wall with protruding niches ("oikoi", "exedrae") at its long sides, an inner courtyard surrounded by columns and a decorative oblong pool in the middle. The library was on the eastern side where rolls of papyrus "books" were kept. Adjoining halls were used as reading rooms, and the corners served as lecture halls.
The library was seriously damaged by the Herulian invasion of 267 and repaired by the prefect Herculius in AD 407-412. During Byzantine times, three churches were built at the site, the remains of which are preserved:
Around the same period as the cathedral another church, Agios Asomatos sta Skalia, was built against the north facade, but it is not preserved.

William Neile

William Neile (7 December 1637 – 24 August 1670) was an English mathematician and founder member of the Royal Society. His major mathematical work, the rectification of the semicubical parabola, was carried out when he was aged nineteen, and was published by John Wallis. By carrying out the determination of arc lengths on a curve given algebraically, in other words by extending to algebraic curves generally with Cartesian geometry a basic concept from differential geometry, it represented a major advance in what would become infinitesimal calculus. His name also appears as Neil.
Life.
Neile was born at Bishopsthorpe, the eldest son of Sir Paul Neile MP for Ripon and Newark. His grandfather was Richard Neile, the Archbishop of York. He entered Wadham College, Oxford as a gentleman-commoner in 1652, matriculating in 1655. He was taught by John Wilkins and Seth Ward.
In 1657, he became a student at the Middle Temple. In the same year he gave his exact rectification of the semicubical parabola and communicated his discovery to William Brouncker, Christopher Wren and others connected with Gresham College. His demonstration was published by Wallis in "De Cycloide" (1659). The general formula for rectification by definite integral was in effect discovered by Hendrik van Heuraet in 1659. In 1673 Wallis asserted that Christiaan Huyghens, who was advancing his own claim to have influenced Heuraet, was also slighting the priority of Neile.
Neile was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 January 1663 and a member of the council on 11 April 1666. He entered the debate on the theory of motion, as a critic of the empiricist stance of other members. His own theory of motion was held up from publication by unfavourable peer review by Wallis, in 1667; a revision was communicated to the society on 29 April 1669. Neile objected to Wren's 1668 work on collision as lacking discussion of causality: he asked for discussion of the nature of momentum. His own work was much influenced by ideas drawn from the "De Corpore" of Thomas Hobbes.
He made astronomical observations with instruments erected on the roof of his father's residence, the “Hill House” (later called Waltham Place) at White Waltham in Berkshire, where he died at the age of 32. A white marble monument in the parish church of White Waltham commemorates him and an inscribed slab in the floor marks his burial-place. He belonged to the privy council of King Charles II.

Pamela Irving

Pamela Irving (born 1960) is a Australian visual artist specialising in bronze, ceramic and mosaic sculptures as well as printmaking and copper etchings. In addition to her extensive art work, Irving has lectured in art and ceramics at Monash University, the Melbourne College of Advanced Education, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and the Chisholm Institute of Technology. She also worked as an art critic for the Geelong Advertiser and was a councillor on the Craft Council of Victoria.
Education.
Born in Victoria, Australia, Irving was formally educated at the Melbourne State College (1979–1982) where she undertook a Bachelor of Education (Art/Craft) and she completed a Master of Arts degree by research at the Melbourne College of Advanced Education. Supervised by Professor Noel John Flood,(ceramicist and the Head of Ceramics Department), Irving was one of the first two candidates to be approved to undertake the Master of Arts Degree in Visual Arts in what was, at that time, the Melbourne CAE.
Irving's thesis for her Master's degree examined 'the reasons and meaning behind the presence and mythology imagery in the works of Arthur Boyd, John Perceval and Mirka Mora (those artists being nominated because of the relevance to my own work)'.
Style and influences.
Pascoe observes that Irving's work is derived from 'a mixture of personal experience, myth and virulent imagination'. Hammond has described Irving's early ceramic work as 'humorous, figurative and cheerfully contemptuous of pottery traditions. 
Irving's early art was influenced by artists including Arthur Boyd, John Brack, Noel Connihan, Mirka Mora, Sidney Nolan and John Perceval. In recent years, Irving has been influenced ″by the honest and direct expressiveness of ‘outsider art’ (the art of self-taught or ‘naive artists’) and the craft of ‘memoryware’″ Significantly, this interest grew following Irving's visit to Nek Chand's Rock Garden in Chandigarh, India.
Notable work.
Irving's most famous work is the bronze sculpture of Larry La Trobe, commissioned in 1992 as a part of the Swanston Street redevelopment in Melbourne, and stolen by a thief or thieves unknown during 1995. The resulting media attention rallied significant public support for the recovery of the sculpture. Although never recovered, the statue was recast by the foundry owner, Peter Kolliner, with some minor changes by Irving and was replaced in September 1996. The "Larry" sculpture is located at the corner of Swanston Street and Collins Street, Melbourne.
Professional associations.
Active in mosaic art in Australia, Irving served as a councillor on the Craft Council of Victoria during the 1980s and became Vice-President of the Mosaic Association of Australia and New Zealand in 2007.
Exhibitions.
Between 1981 and 2003, Irving took part in 18 solo exhibitions, 11 joint exhibitions and more than 80 group exhibitions.
Collections.
Irving's work is held in the following collections:

Norton Juxta Twycross

Norton Juxta Twycross, usually known as simply "Norton" "(or "Norton-Juxta")", is a small village in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. The village is part of the parish of Appleby Magna, with the vicar based in Appleby.
The village has traditionally, and historically, been known as "Norton": deriving from the Anglo-Saxon, meaning "North-Town"; with variable spellings including "Northton" and "Nortone". The village, however, was also known for a brief period in the 17th century as "Hoggs Norton". The village's current name was acquired to differentiate the village from the several others in the county named Norton. "Juxta" is Latin for "near", and Twycross is a small village approximately 2 miles southeast of Norton.
History.
The village of Norton is thought to have been founded in the 8th or 9th century by the Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxon King Æthelred granted the village a charter in 951, referring to it as "Northton"
The village is listed in the Domesday Book as "Norton", and the Lord of the Manor was recorded in both 1066 and 1086 as Countess "(Lady)" Godiva, widow of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, famed (legendarily) for riding naked around the streets of Coventry. In both 1066 and 1086 the village is recorded as worth £0.3. 
The village is listed as a very small settlement, with only four households, but has a quite large taxable value of 6 geld units. The Domesday Book records the village as home to 1 villager, 2 small holders and a priest, and is recorded as having land for 7 ploughs and 8 acres of meadow.
In 1325 several people in Norton were arrested for the murder of Sir William de Monte Gomeri, which took place near to Merevale Abbey. Philippa, widow of the murdered Sir William, said that it was in the manor house at Norton, belonging to Walter de Monte Gomeri(unclear how they are related; may have been brother of deceased), that Robert de Gresley had sent his brother Peter to kill her husband. He was struck over the head by a sword, and died in Phillipa's arms. Philippa accused Joan, wife of Walter de Monte Gomeri of also being present at Norton Manor during that meeting, and of "aiding, abetting and procuring the death of her husband".
Robert and Joan appeared before the County Court and were transferred for trial at the Court of King's Bench. Both stated they were not guilty but only Joan was given bail until the trial. The jury of their trial returned a not guilty verdict for the pair. Peter de Greseleye and another supposed accomplice William de Northfolk, both failed to appear before the County Court and were declared outlaws.
Norton was previously an independent parish, however, by 1839 was recorded as a chapelry within the parish of Orton on the Hill. It is currently within the parish of Appleby Magna.
Holy Trinity Church.
The Village's parish church is dedicated to The Holy Trinity.
The original church was built of wood in the 12th century, and the village acquiring its first rector in 1220, whilst the church's Advowson was under the control of Belvoir Priory.
The church seen today was built in the early 14th century, although it was heavily restored around 1841. The tower formerly had a small spire, but this was dismantled in 1890 as it had become unsafe. The tower had also originally contained 3 bells: 1640 and the other two in 1663. One, however, was recast in 1849. The tower's clock was made by Samuel Deacon's company in Barton in the Beans. It was installed on 1 September 1840, having cost £80. The church vesty was built in 1850 and cost £100 to construct.
The church is unusual in having two pulpits. The church's Gothic style barrel organ was built in 1819, in London, by James Butler: an apprentice of George England. It was installed within the church in 1840 and restored in 1980, by John Burns of Nuneaton
In 1829, on the appointment of the Hon. Alfred Curzon as rector, the parish is revealed to have an annual income of £332 9s. 11¼d; £200 of which came from the rental of the church's Glebe lands and the rental of part of the parsonage house.
Rectors.
Rectors of Holy Trinity Church, Norton: "(incomplete)"
Norton Rectory.
There have been several rectories (earlier known as parsonage houses) at Norton. In 1725 Reverend Reuben Clark built a new rectory, but this had fallen into disrepair by 1797. Reverend William Carsons "(tenure 1746-1811)" attempted to under take repairs, but they were not completed. When The Hon. Alfred Curzon (son of Nathaniel Curzon, 2nd Baron Scarsdale) took over the position of rector in 1829, the house was still unsuitable. Curzon (who had gained his position through family connections to the local land owner, the Earl Howe) chose to reside instead in a house near to his birthplace at Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire (over 27 miles away): his duties as priest fulfilled by a curate from the neighboring parish of Appleby Magna.
This lack of occupation is probably the cause of the rectory's ongoing dilapidation, which was confirmed again in 1835 when the Rectory was described as being in "a bad and dangerous state".
In 1842 the then Rector, Andrew Bloxham, applied to receive Queen Anne's Bounty in order to repair the rectory.
Plans to rebuild were obviously abandoned when in 1850 reverend William Thomas Pearce Mead King constructed a new vicarage to the South-West of the village. The old rectory and outbuildings still remained until at least 1887, however, when they were being used as a farm.
Pearce Mead King's new construction served as the village's rectory until Norton joined Appleby Magna Parish, at which point it became a private residence, known as Norton Grange. In 1963 Norton Grange and its 12 acre gardens, were purchased for £12,000 by zoologist Molly Badham, who founded Twycross Zoo (at first known as The East Midlands Zoological Society) in the rectory's gardens. Molly and the Zoo are famed for her work training Chimps, most notably for use in the PG Tips Tea Television advertisements which ran from the 1960s to the 1980s.
Population.
The Hearth tax reveals there were 16 families living in the village in 1564 and a total of 40 inhabitants were charged the tax in 1664.
In 1829 the parish of Norton is revealed to have had a population of 301; with an additional 74 living in an exclave of the parish at Bilston.

Chevron Richmond Refinery

The Chevron Richmond Refinery is a petroleum refinery in Richmond, California, on San Francisco Bay. It is owned and operated by Chevron Corporation and employs more than 1,200 workers, making it the city's largest employer. The refinery processes approximately of crude oil a day in the manufacture of petroleum products and other chemicals. The refinery's primary products are motor gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel and lubricants.
History.
Beginnings.
The refinery was established several years before the City of Richmond was incorporated in 1905. Construction on the refinery began in 1901 between the Potrero Hills and the marshlands in the Point Richmond District; the refinery was opened in 1902. The refinery was built by Standard Oil and its first headquarters was in an abandoned farm house at the former site of the Peters and Silva Farms. The complex was described as "colossal" at the time and to this day it remains a very large complex in its kind. In its first year of operation the plant could process of oil per day and had a tankage capacity of in that same first year. William Rheem played a key role in the facility's construction and implementation, being the project manager and the installation's first superintendent. Furthermore, Rheem continued on to be a key and historic civic figure in the City of Richmond. The presence of the burgeoning refinery transformed the small town of Richmond from a rural agricultural community with 200 residents to a company town of several thousand within a few years.
Growth.
The number of passenger cars in the United States rose from 1.6 million to 5.6 million from 1914 to 1918. Motor trucks, farm tractors, and aircraft all increased at a comparable rate. As a result the demand for gasoline, lubricants and other petroleum products intensified. The Richmond refinery was in an excellent position with its plentiful crude oil, state-of-art equipment and prime location to capitalize on the increased demand for petroleum products on the West Coast. By 1915, the refinery spread across , employed 1,700 workers, and had a capacity of a day. Not only did the refinery produce transportation fuels, it also had a grease plant, an asphaltum plant, a can factory, a barrel works, a machine shop and a tank car repair shop.
When the United States entered World War I in 1917, the Richmond refinery became a critical producer of fuel for trucks, tankers, trains, and planes in the war effort. Historian Gerald White reported that the "high quality of the medicinal white oil developed at Richmond to take the place of Russian white oil, cut off by the war, caused an executive of E.R. Squibb & Sons to comment that the Richmond product was 'superior to the best oil' ever imported." 
At the end of the war the company shifted its focus back to basic product research and in 1919 constructed a well-equipped red brick laboratory building that still stands today. Development manager Ralph A. Halloran's emphasis on centralized, systematic research helped the department gain greater prestige in support of the company's tenet, "Research First - Then Advertising," which ensured that a product was thoroughly tested before being introduced to the public. By 1924, the laboratory's staff grew to 75 skilled employees, who engaged in tests and experiments, not only to develop new uses for petroleum, but to improve existing processes. In 1938 the refinery constructed a new Hydro Plant for the production of synthetic aviation gasoline. It was the first in the Western United States to produce synthetic gasoline by combining purified hydrogen gas with an unsaturated gas by-product from gasoline cracking operations.
With the onset of World War II the refinery saw major changes. Many employees left for service in the U.S. military and close to 400 women joined the refinery workforce. The refinery shifted production to high-octane fuel and other products to meet military needs. In 1943 a toluene plant was constructed to supply the key ingredient for TNT and later, at the request of the U.S. military, was converted to production of 100-octane gasoline. The U.S. Secretaries of War and Navy and the Petroleum Administrator commended the refinery for exceeding the production of aviation gasoline requested by the government. In 1945, the Richmond refinery won its fifth U.S. Army-Navy "E" award for its support of the military effort.
Modernization.
Following the end of World War II, the refinery began a long-range modernization and expansion of its facilities to accommodate the new post-war consumer demands for petroleum products. The refinery constructed units that increased production of highly refined products for the postwar generation of higher-compression engines. In 1951, a residuum stripper was constructed to convert heavy residual fuel oil into lighter products. In 1959, the company made a major breakthrough when it developed the Isocracking process which uses catalysts to rearrange the existing molecules of heavy fuel oils to remove sulfur and convert low-value fuel oils into higher-yield products such as gasoline. The company also completed a new fluid catalytic cracking unit capable of processing daily of feed stock, further adding to the high-octane gasolines being demanded in rapidly increasing quantities by modern, high-compression automobile engines. In 1965, a breakthrough came when the Richmond refinery opened the world's largest Isomax hydrocracking complex. The unit converts heavy petroleum oils to lighter stocks for gasoline and other higher valued products. The -a-day unit increased the plant's gasoline output by 40%. A solvent de-asphalting plant and a hydrogen manufacturing plant were also constructed to support the Isomax and were the largest of their kind ever constructed.
The post-war years were also marked by a dramatic increase in demand for petrochemicals to serve as the building blocks for hundreds of essential consumer products. In 1951, a new unit was constructed to manufacture paraxylene, a basic material used for making synthetic fibers, and was the first of its kind to produce the chemical from petroleum. The West Coast's first phenol plant was completed in 1954 for the production of lubricating oil and lubricating oil additive, resins and plastic, and plywood adhesives. A year later, another chemical plant for the manufacture of isophtalic was constructed, the first in the US. Isophtalic is a chemical intermediate used in plastics and surface coatings. In 1960, construction began on a $17 million complex for production of para- and orthoxylenes, important chemical intermediates, at the Richmond refinery. Another major project increased the capacity for production of alpha olefins, used extensively in the manufacture of "soft" detergents, lubricant additives, plastics and plasticizers. None of these chemical plants are still in operation today except for the alpha olefin plant, which produces an intermediate chemical for the production of Techron, Chevron's gasoline additive.
Recent history.
During the 1970s and 1980s as the dynamics of the United States petroleum industry were changing, the refinery was transformed to produce higher-value, higher-volume fuels and lubricating oils and to comply with increasingly stringent state and federal policies. These policies called for the refinery to reduce air emissions and waste, treat water, and prevent oil spills.
In order to comply with federal mandates for reduced-lead gasoline the refinery installed reforming units in 1971 to produce higher octane gasoline material. In 1975, the refinery added a desulfurization unit for the production of low-sulfur fuel oil, primarily to supply the growing needs of California electric utility companies. The expansion was also designed to process greater quantities of high-sulfur crudes and products that met environmental specifications. During the expansion the refinery also built two storage tanks, the largest in the United States, to receive marine cargos.
In 1979, a worldwide shortage of crude oil, along with a shift in the availability of quality crudes, presented challenges to manufacturing operations. Chevron invested in the Richmond refinery, improving their flexibility for handling different types of crude oil, responding to changing product standards, installing energy conservation equipment, and complying with environmental or regulatory requirements. A $17 million direct digital computer control system was first installed in the Isomax plant, and later expanded to include all plants. This enabled the refinery to produce higher-grade products and reduce energy consumption.
In 1984, the construction of a major lubricating oil manufacturing plant increased Richmond's lube oil base-stock output from 3,800 to a day, using hydrocracking and hydrorefining processes developed by Chevron Research. Later, in 1993, a major research breakthrough occurred when Chevron introduced Isodewaxing technology. This new technique maximized the production of high quality base oils while co-producing high-value light products and allowed for the economical production of base oils that meet specifications calling for lighter-viscosity lubricant grades.
During the 1990s the refinery began producing Chevron Plus Unleaded gasoline, which replaced regular leaded gasoline in California in 1992. Methyl tert-butyl ether, or MTBE, was added as an oxygenate and to raise the octane number. However, MTBE was found to contaminate groundwater, and in 2004 was replaced with ethanol.
In 2001 former vice mayor and councilman John Márquez stated that he did not think that the refinery's numerous toxic spills were intentional. He also stated that he thought the refinery was safe. He received campaign funding from BAPAC, that was backed by a $1,500 from Chevron Corporation. Marquez also opposed measure T and the 16,000,000 dollars that it would bring the city from large industries like Chevron.
In 2002, the 100th anniversary of the Richmond refinery, the plant had over 1,300 employees, covered 2,900 acres, operated 30 plants, and had the ability to move per day of raw materials and finished products across its long wharf. By 2006, the refinery had a capacity of a day and processed more crude oil than any other plant in the Bay Area and ranked among the major refineries in the U.S.
In March 2014, the company launched a website to provide Richmond-area community news.
1999 explosion and fire.
On March 25, 1999, there was an explosion and fire at the refinery that spread noxious fumes and sent hundreds of Richmond residents to hospitals.
2012 fire.
On August 6, 2012, a large fire erupted at the refinery at about 6:15 PM and reported to be contained at 10:40 PM. Flames were seen issuing from at least two of the refinery's towers. Contra Costa Health Services responded by notifying residents shelter in place. BART shut down local service. The shelter-in-place order was lifted at 11:15 PM. Initial reports estimated that 11,000 people sought treatment at area hospitals, and later reports placed the number above 15,000 people.
A refinery spokeswoman stated that the fire erupted in the number 4 crude distillation unit, or CDU. Just before 6:30 p.m., an inspection crew discovered that there was a diesel leak in a line in the CDU—and that the leak was growing. The crew evacuated the area just before the diesel ignited, said Nigel Hearne, manager of the refinery.
Three refinery workers were given first aid at the refinery. On April 15, 2013, the US Chemical Safety Board released their preliminary report citing Chevron for a chronic failure to replace aging equipment and called for an overhaul of regulatory oversight of the industry to prevent such accidents from happening again 
Analysts predicted that the fire would cause an increase in gasoline prices in the western United States. A Chevron spokesperson later said that the fire was one factor among others, including the price of crude oil, that influenced prices. However, data collected by the California Energy Commission showed that increased production at other refineries more than made up for the Richmond loss, with 461,000 gallons of crude oil added to state refinery production during the week of August 3 through August 10, 2012.
In 2013, the company pleaded no contest to six charges in connection with the fire, and agreed to pay $2 million in fines and restitution. On the first anniversary of the fire, 210 people were arrested while marching to protest safety issues at the refinery.
Around the same time the settlement was announced, the Richmond city council voted to file suit against Chevron. The reasons for the suit included "a continuation of years of neglect, lax oversight and corporate indifference to necessary safety inspection and repairs."
Employees.
The Richmond refinery currently employs more than 1,200 people.
During the worst years of the Great Depression the refinery instituted a job sharing program under which more than 3,000 workers were able to retain their jobs by sharing their work with others who were often transferred from positions that had been terminated. One historian credited the companies for helping to maintain Richmond's economic viability during this difficult time, stating: "the worst effects of the stagnant economy were certainly blunted by the ability of Richmond's businesses to keep their factories running and their employees working."
During the refinery's early years it held an enlightened personnel policy that included frequent promotions, the establishment of an eight-hour work day beginning in 1917, and thorough training program for its employees and for apprentices, who often advanced to regular jobs as journeymen at the end of a four-year period. Similar programs still exist today.
The refinery's firehouse helps the Richmond Fire Department especially when their special equipment such as firefighting foam is needed.
Environmental.
Air quality monitoring.
Chevron is currently implementing an Air Quality Monitoring program in the surrounding neighborhoods of North Richmond, Point Richmond and Atchison Village. This program is part of the Richmond Community Benefits Agreement (RCBA, Section 2.F(2)) for the Chevron Energy and Hydrogen Renewal Project. The Air Quality Monitoring Program will sample air quality using testing methods similar to those used by government agencies and publish these results on a community-accessible website.
Some citizens routinely patrol the area with air collection bins to measure the chemical content of the air.
Castro Cove.
Between 1902 and 1987 the refinery released noxious chemicals into the surrounding environment with impunity. This came in the form of contaminated process water from the industrial facilities of the complex. There are unhealthy levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and mercury in the estuarine habitats of Castro Cove and the San Pablo Creek Marsh adjacent to the refinery's runoff from their waste water outfall. The water is highly toxic to wildlife and is too polluted for fishing, swimming, or wading. 
Since 1987 the refinery has reduced the impact of discharged process water by improving water treatment to reduce contaminants, including metals, by approximately 80 percent and reducing the amount of treated water discharged from to . Additionally, in 1987 the refinery completed the deepwater discharge project moving the effluent discharge point from Castro Cove to deep water in San Pablo Bay to provide for greater dilution of remaining contaminants and minimize the impact on water quality.
In 2007 and 2008, Chevron engaged in a clean-up operation of the cove that cost between $20 and $30 million after being ordered to do so by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board's Bay Protection and Toxic Clean-up Program (which found Chevron liable for an additional $2.85 million in "natural resources damages.")
Controversies.
Tax rates.
In 2006 a local referendum (Measure T) proposed to raise the business tax. Chevron vehemently opposed the initiative and funded a massive flyer campaign, suggesting it would lead to evictions of seniors and closing of small businesses. The measure failed by 54%. However, in 2008 the measure was revived, modified to tax only large manufacturers; it passed by 51.5%.
Unpaid taxes.
In 2009 the Chevron refinery agreed to pay the city of Richmond $28 million in back utility taxes.
In 2011 Chevron unsuccessfully sued Contra Costa County for 73 million dollars claiming its property taxes were too high. The company's lawyers stated that the refinery was not worth $3 billion in 2007 and 2009 as assessed, but instead only worth $1.8 and $1.15 billion respectively. During the hearings, Gayle McGlaughlin, Mayor of Richmond, stated "If Chevron wins this appeal, it will mean layoffs, major cutbacks in services and would push us virtually to the edge of bankruptcy. Cities are suffering and Chevron is making billions of dollars." Kevin Lally, attorney acting for Richmond during the appeal, stated that Chevron had manipulated data, refused to give the assessor's staff necessary information, and falsely characterized the nature of the county's assessment process, stating that Chevron's analysis was "fraught with materials that don’t satisfy evidentiary standards.” Around fifty protestors organized by the Richmond Progressive Alliance including Richmond mayor Gayle McGlaughlin and city councilmember Jovanka Beckels protested at the hearings, silently holding signs.
The Assessment Appeals Board eventually found against Chevron's appeal, found that the county assessor had actually undervalued Chevron's refinery, and ordered Chevron to pay an additional $26.7 million in taxes, rather than receiving the $73 million refund Chevron sought.
Bay Trail.
A portion of the San Francisco Bay Trail from Point Molate through to Point San Pablo crosses oil pipelines that connect the Chevron refinery with the Richmond Long Wharf. Chevron opposed the construction of this segment of the Bay Trail, citing security concerns, and stating that post-September 11th security requirements posed an issue. Supporters of the Bay Trail along with then California Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi pushed Chevron in to accepting the construction of the Bay Trail in exchange for allowing the company to renew its 30-year lease on state tidelands that lie at the site of its port. In addition, the Richmond city council passed a resolution 8-1 directing mayor Gayle McLaughlin to ask the California State Land Use Commission to persuade Chevron to permit the trail.
Chevron claimed that its total commitment in the Bay Trail amounted to $12.5 million, with $3 million being taken from Chevron's backtaxes, and $7.5 million worth of land being committed to the project. A Chevron spokesperson stated that these numbers had been arrived at using Chevron assessors. Bruce Beyaert, head of the Trails for Richmond Action Committee (and former Chevron environmental executive) disagreed with Chevron's stated figures, saying that they were heavily inflated and amounted to "smoke and mirrors." Beyaert pointed to a 2001 joint trail study finding the trail easement south of I-580 worth $280,000, not the three million dollars Chevron assessed it at. Beyaert also states that there had previously been discussions to give land north of I-580 for free under an East Bay rails to trails project, land which Chevron's internal assessors valued at $4.5 million upon agreeing to the Bay Trail's construction. The portion of the trail in question has since been completed.

<doc id="21605556" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21605556" title="Paila criolla">
Paila criolla

Paila criolla is the term given to a Cuban membranophone. It consists of a shallow metal casing or paila (cookware of Spanish origin; in Catalonian language it is called paella), with a single-headed drum.
Paila criolla was initially used by street bands in the 19th century. They are shallower in shape than single-headed tom-toms, and come in double sets, tuned an octave apart. The player (known as a "timbalero") uses a variety of stick strokes, rim shots, and rolls on the skins to produce a wide range of percussive expression during solos and at transitional sections of music, and usually plays the shells of the drum or auxiliary percussion such as a cowbell (cencerro). Pailas are always hit with straight batons that have no additional head. Hits are made on the top and on the metal sides. 
The shells are referred to as "cáscara" (the Spanish word for "shell") which is also the name of a rhythmic pattern common in Cuban music that is played on the shells of the pailas to keep time. The shells are made of metal. The heads are light and tuned fairly high for their size. Pailas are now often called "timbales", but the term timbales is ambiguous, because it was also used to described kettle drums.
History of the term in Cuba.
Although the term "timbal" or "timbales" (pl.) is often used now to mean pailas, there is a problem with this usage, because timbal has been used in Cuba for "two quite different types of drum". In the first place, it was first used to describe the kettle drums used in the wind orchestras known as Orquesta típica. These were the same general type of drum used in military bands, perhaps slung either side of a horse, and in classical orchestras. These were, and are, played with sticks which have softish round heads.
The orquestas típicas were gradually replaced early in the 20th century by charangas. The general idea of the charanga was to replace the wind instruments with violins and flute to bring a brighter, lighter tone to the band. The typani were replaced by "pailas criollas", which because of their light weight were originally used by street bands. Pailas were taken over by the early charangas; their original name is still used in Cuba, but over time the familiar term "timbal" has been taken over to describe the pailas. There is often a second set of even smaller drums, "timbalitos" (= pailitas), which produce an even higher note when struck. In a modern band the timbalero may also have a trap kit as an alternate for certain numbers.
Thus the term "timbales" is ambiguous, particularly when referring to bands playing the danzón in the 1900–1930 period. If one does not have a photograph it is difficult to know which type of drum was used by the band.

Denis Godefroy

Denis Godefroy ("Dionysius Gothofredus"; 17 October 1549 – 7 September 1622), jurist, son of Leon Godefroy, lord of Guignecourt, was born in Paris.
He was educated at the Collège de Navarre, and studied law at Louvain, Cologne, and Heidelberg, returning to Paris in 1573. He embraced the reformed religion, and in 1579 left Paris, where his abilities and connections promised a brilliant career, to establish himself at Geneva. He became professor of law there, received the freedom of the city in 1580 and in 1587 became a member of the Council of the Two Hundred. Henry IV of France induced him to return to France by making him "grand bailli" of Gex, but no sooner had he installed himself than the town was sacked and his library burnt by the troops of the duke of Savoy. In 1591 he became professor of Roman law at Strassburg, where he remained until April 1600, when in response to an invitation from Frederick IV, Elector Palatine, he removed to Heidelberg. The difficulties of his position led to his return to Strassburg for a short time, but in November 1604 he definitely settled at Heidelberg. He was made head of the faculty of law in the university, and was from time to time employed on missions to the French court. His repeated refusal of offers of advancement in his own country was due to his Calvinism. He died at Strassburg, having left Heidelberg before the city was sacked by the imperial troops in 1621. His most important work was the new edition of Corpus juris civilis, originally published at Geneva in 1583, which went through some twenty editions, the most valuable of them being that printed by the Elzevirs at Amsterdam in 1633 and the Leipzig edition of 1740.

Lists of his other learned works may be found in Senebier's "Hist. litt. de Genève", vol. ii., and in Nicéron's "Mémoires", vol. xvii. Some of his correspondence with his learned friends, with his kinsman President de Thou, Isaac Casaubon, Jean Jacques Grynaeus, and others, is preserved in the libraries of the British Museum, of Basel and Paris.

Minuscule 218

Minuscule 218 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), ε 233 (Soden), is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the Old Testament (Septuaginta) and New Testament, on parchment. It is one of the few manuscripts with the complete Greek Bible. Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 13th century. It has marginalia.
Description.
The codex contains the text of the both Testaments, on 623 parchment leaves (size ), with some lacunae (Rev. 13:5-14:8; 15:7-17:2; 18:10-19:15; 20:7-22:21). The text is written in two columns per page, 50-52 lines per page. The text of New Testament is on leaves 486-623.
The order of books: Acts, Catholic epistles, Pauline epistles. Epistle to the Hebrews is placed between 2 Thessalonians and 1 Timothy.
The text is divided according to the ("chapters"), whose numbers are given at the margin, and their ("titles of chapters") at the top of the pages. The text of the Gospels has also another division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections, but without references to the Eusebian Canons.
It contains tables of the ("tables of contents") before each book, subscriptions at the end of each book, the Euthalian Apparatus (in Acts, Cath., and Paul), the Eusebian Canons absent.
Text.
The Greek text of the New Testament of this codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type (except epistles). Aland placed it in Category III in the Catholic and Pauline epistles and in Category V in rest of New Testament books. It contains many peculiar readings.
According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents textual family Kx in Luke 1 and Luke 20. In Luke 10 no profile was made. It creates textual cluster with minuscule 187.

Process isolation

Process isolation is a set of different hardware and software technologies designed to protect each process from other processes on the operating system. It does so by preventing process A from writing to process B. 
Process isolation can be implemented by with virtual address space, where process A's address space is different from process B's address space - preventing A to write into B. 
Security is easier to enforce by disallowing inter-process memory access, than compared to less secure architectures (such as DOS) in which any process can write to any memory in any other process )
Limited inter processes communication.
In a system with process isolation, processes may still be allowed limited (controlled) interaction between processes, if processes mutually accept to collaborate over inter-process communication (IPC) channels such as shared memory, local sockets or Internet sockets. In this scheme almost all of the process' memory is isolated from other processes, except in the variables/memory where the process is allowing input from collaborating processes.
System polices may disallow IPC in some circumstances. For example in mandatory access control systems, subjects with different sensitivity levels may not be allowed to communicate with each other.
Operating systems.
Notable operating systems that support process isolation:
Web browsers.
Internet Explorer 4 used process isolation in order to allow separate windowed instances of the browser their own processes; however, at the height of the browser wars, this was dropped in subsequent versions to compete with Netscape Navigator (which sought to concentrate upon one process for the entire Internet suite). This idea of process-per-instance would not be revisited until a decade afterwards, when tabbed browsing became more commonplace.
In Google Chrome's "Multi-Process Architecture" and Internet Explorer 8's "Loosely Coupled IE (LCIE)", tabs containing webpages are contained within their own semi-separate OS-level processes which are isolated from the core process of the browser so as to prevent the crash of one tab/page from crashing the entire browser. This method (known popularly as multiprocess or process-per-tab) is meant to both manage memory and processing by allowing offending tabs to crash separately from the browser and other tabs and manage security.

Henry Graham Pollard (known as Graham Pollard) (7 March 1903 – 15 November 1976) was a British bookseller and bibliographer.
Pollard was the son of the historian Albert Pollard and was born in Putney, London on 7 March 1903. After studying at Shrewsbury School, Pollard studied history for one year at University College, London before winning a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford in 1921, obtaining a third-class degree in history in 1924. In that year he married Kay Beauchamp, pioneering Communist and women's rights campaigner. (Their marriage was dissolved in 1972).
Even whilst he was a student, he was well known as a book collector, and bought part of a booksellers' business (Birrell and Garnett) in London. He became managing director in 1927, with the company producing many noted catalogues in the 1920s and 1930s, some of which were to become standard works of reference. Pollard's knowledge of his subject was displayed in his contributions to "The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature" and in his lectures and articles. With John Carter, he wrote "An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets" (1934), exposing the prominent book collector Thomas J. Wise as a fraud.
In 1939, the bookshop partnership ended and Pollard became a special lecturer at University College, London before joining the Board of Trade in 1942; whilst this was supposedly a temporary appointment, he remained until retirement in 1959. He maintained his bibliographical interests, publishing an edition of "The Earliest Directory of the Book Trade" by John Pendred (1785), and lecturing in Cambridge shortly before his retirement. During his retirement, he was president from 1960 to 1962 of the London Bibliographical Society, which awarded him its Gold Medal in 1969, and was Reader in Bibliography at the University of Oxford in 1961, lecturing on the book trade in medieval Oxford. He also lectured in the United States in 1973, and received a volume of essays published in his honour by the Oxford Bibliographical Society in 1975.

Lucrecia (singer)

Lucrecia Pérez Sáez is a Spanish-Cuban singer born in Havana who currently lives in Barcelona.
She was born in Santo Suarez neighborhood in Havana, and passed her childhood in Guanabacoa, a township within the province of La Habana.
She has worked in various movies and with several long established artists, including Celia Cruz, Chavela Vargas, Joaquín Sabina, Andy Garcia, Manzanita or Lluís Llach.
Artistic career.
At the early age of seven, Lucrecia Sáez Pérez began studying piano and music and was certified with a specialty in piano at the Instituto Superior de Arte de Cuba. She studied singing with Isolina Carrillo, the composer of the famous bolero "Dos Gardenias", popularized in Spain by Cuban singer Antonio Machin.
Soon after completing her education, Lucrecia joined La Orquesta Anacoana, an all-female group which, since its founding in 1932, had become a Cuban institution. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Lucrecia made several international tours with the group.
It was with Anacaona, as lead vocalist, keyboardist and arranger, that Lucrecia first arrived in Spain. Later, in 1993, she left Anacaona and returned to settle in Barcelona, where she has remained. Since establishing her solo career there, she has become very active in Spanish film and television as well as the music scene. Though not yet well known in the English-speaking world, she is a celebrated figure not only in Catalunya, but in Spain and, increasingly, in Latin America and the Hispanic community of the United States.
Although she personally eschews such comparisons, Lucrecia has been touted as a successor to the great Celia Cruz, with whom she was a close friend.
Lucrecia's 2010 "Álbum de Cuba" was nominated for Best Tropical Music Album in the 2010 Latin Grammy Awards.
Since leaving Anacaona and becoming an expatriate of Cuba, the Cuban government has not allowed her to return, but she was able to bring her mother to Barcelona which they both make their permanent home. 
Through the length of her career, Lucrecia has collaborated or performed with numerous masters of the art, including Celia Cruz, Paquito D’Rivera, Chano Domínguez, Joaquín Sabina, Wyclef Jean, Carlos "Patato" Valdes, Carel Kraayenhof, Willy Chirino, Chavela Vargas, Lluís Llach, Gilberto Gil, Israel "Cachao" López, Andy García, Carlos Jean, etc.
Among her collaborations should be noted "Cachao: The Last Mambo", a winning album at the Latin Grammy awards in 2011 and for the 2012 Grammy Awards. Based on a memorable concert recorded live in Miami in September 2007, the album was as tribute to Israel "Cachao" Lopez celebrating the 80-year musical career of that great master.
As an artist, Lucretia has combined her musical side with television, having been involved in programs of considerable success in Spain. On Televisión Española, she was host of the successful children's program "Los Lunnis". Lucrecia has also demonstrated her facet as a writer. In 2004, she made her debut as a writer of children's stories with “Besitos de chocolate” (Little Chocolate Kisses) ( "Tales of my childhood"), after which have followed two more books from the same collection: "The Valley of the Tenderness" (2005) and "All the Colors of the World" (2008), all in collaboration with Los Lunnis. Continuing in this vein, Lucrecia has edited her disk and video "La Casita de Lucrecia".
In the June 2012 began the tour "Eternally Cuba". More information of the same in www.lucreciamusic.com

<doc id="21605714" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21605714" title="Drugs in pregnancy">
Drugs in pregnancy

Drug use during pregnancy can have temporary or permanent effects on the fetus. Any drug that acts during embryonic or fetal development to produce a permanent alteration of form or function is known as a teratogen. Drugs may refer to both pharmaceutical drug and recreational drugs.
Pharmaceutical drugs.
Prescription drugs.
Many physicians prefer not to prescribe drugs for pregnant women due to concerns over teratogenicity. The apprehension is not necessarily data driven and is a cautionary response to the lack of clinical studies in pregnant women. The indication is a trade-off between the adverse effects of the drug, the risks associated with intercurrent diseases and pregnancy complications, and the efficacy of the drug to prevent or ameliorate such risks. In some cases, the use of drugs in pregnancy carries benefits that outweigh the risks. For example, high fever is harmful for the fetus in the early months, thus the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is generally associated with lower risk than the fever itself. Similarly, diabetes mellitus during pregnancy may need intensive therapy with insulin to prevent complications to mother and baby.
Pregnancy categories.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed a rating system to provide therapeutic guidance based on potential benefits and fetal risks. Drugs have been classified into categories A, B, C, D and X based on this system of classification. Drugs, and some multivitamins, that have demonstrated no fetal risks after controlled studies in humans are classified as Category A, while drugs like thalidomide with proven fetal risks that outweigh all benefits are classified as Category X.
Examples.
Antibacterial agents
Cardiovascular drugs
Central nervous system drugs
Others
Alcohol.
Alcohol passes easily through the placenta from the mother's bloodstream into the bloodstream of the fetus. Unlike adults, a fetus does not yet have a blood filtration system, and is therefore unprotected from the effects of alcohol.
Potential Effects.
In the first two weeks following fertilization, maternal alcohol consumption may prevent proper implantation of the fertilized egg, usually terminating the pregnancy before the mother realizes she is pregnant.
Potential problems during pregnancy:
Potential effects in children exposed to alcohol during prenatal development:
Recreational drugs.
Recreational drug use during pregnancy can cause various pregnancy complications.
Cannabis.
Cannabis in pregnancy is the subject of various scientific studies, usually regarding whether it has effects on the child later in life.
Smoking.
A number of studies have shown that tobacco use is a significant factor in miscarriages among pregnant smokers, and that it contributes to a number of other threats to the health of the fetus. Smoking and pregnancy, combined, cause twice the risk of premature rupture of membranes, placental abruption and placenta previa. Also, it causes 30% higher odds of the baby being born prematurely.
By pregnancy stage.
Pregnancy and fetal development progress through various changes. The period of one week from fertilisation to implantation of the fertilized egg is called the preimplantation period. This is an 'all or none' period, .i.e. an insult can either cause death or complete recovery can occur.
The period from the eighth day to the end of eighth week is the period of organogenesis during which the organs are formed in the fetus. This is the most crucial time with regards to 'structural malformations' and concern over teratogenicity of drugs. From the third month to the end of nine months is the period of fetal maturation. Intake of drugs during this period may modify the 'function' of the fetal organs rather than causing gross structural malformations in the fetus; for example, aminoglycosides can affect the functioning of the kidneys as well as the hearing mechanism.

Flammability diagram

Flammability diagrams show the regimes of flammability in mixtures of fuel, oxygen and an inert gas, typically nitrogen. Mixtures of the three gasses are usually depicted in a triangular diagram, also known as a Ternary plot. Such diagrams are available in the speciality literature. The same information can be depicted in a normal orthogonal diagram, showing only two substances, implicitly using that the sum of all three components are 100 percent. The diagrams below only concerns one fuel, the diagrams can be generalized to mixtures of fuels.
Understanding flammability diagrams.
Triangular diagrams are not commonplace. The easiest way to understand them is to briefly go through three basic steps in their construction.

Stephen Nye

Stephen Nye (1648–1719) was an English clergyman, known as a theological writer and for his Unitarian views. 
Life.
Son of John Nye, he graduated B.A. at Magdalene College, Cambridge in 1665. He became rector of Little Hormead, Hertfordshire in 1679. Thomas Firmin was a close associate.
Works.
Nye wrote "Brief History of the Unitarians also called Socinians" (published anonymously in 1687, expanded 1691). 
Although the term “Unitarian” was already known in England from the Latin "Library of the Polish Brethren called Unitarians" published in Amsterdam (1665-1668), and had been used in print before by Henry Hedworth (1673), Nye's book gave the term wider currency in English among antitrinitarian believers, and set off the Unitarian controversy. Nye distinguished Unitarian views from those of Arius (Arian views) and Fausto Sozzini (Socinian views). He called William Sherlock a tritheist, Robert South a Socinian, and John Wallis a Sabellian. He faced much opposition from orthodox Anglicans, but had an ally in William Freke. Thomas Tenison, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1695, discouraged those who wanted to continue the debate.
Nye wrote also on natural religion; he corresponded with Henry Hedworth and published some of those letters.

Fuji Molten Salt Reactor

The FUJI molten salt reactor is a molten-salt-fueled thorium fuel cycle thermal breeder reactor, using technology similar to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Molten Salt Reactor Experiment - liquid fluoride thorium reactor. It is being developed by the Japanese company International Thorium Energy & Molten-Salt Technology (IThEMS), together with partners from the Czech Republic. As a breeder reactor, it converts thorium into the nuclear fuel uranium-233. To achieve reasonable neutron economy, the chosen single-salt design results in significantly larger feasible size than a two-salt reactor (where blanket is separated from core, which involves graphite-tube manufacturing/sealing complications). Like all molten salt reactors, its core is chemically inert and under low pressure, helping to prevent explosions and toxic releases. The proposed design is rated at 200 MWe output.
The consortium plans to first build a much smaller MiniFUJI 10 MWe reactor of the same design once it has secured an additional $300 million in funding.

Malaysia–Vietnam relations

Malaysia–Vietnam relations (Malay "Hubungan Malaysia-Vietnam" ; Vietnamese "Quan hệ Malaysia-Việt Nam") dates back to at least 15th century. Malaysia forged diplomatic ties with the modern-day Vietnamese state in 30 March 1973 which have lasted until today. Relations between two countries were frosty in the late 1970s and 1980s as a result of the Cambodian–Vietnamese War and the influx of Vietnamese boat people into Malaysia. The subsequent resolution of these issues saw the cultivation of strong trade and economic ties, and bilateral trade between the two countries grew exponentially with an expansion to other areas especially in information technology, education and defence.
The two countries share a maritime border in the Gulf of Thailand as well as the South China Sea and have a few overlapping claims in the Spratly Islands. Both have an embassy located on the other's capital; Vietnam has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and Malaysia has an embassy in Hanoi as well as a consulate office in Ho Chi Minh City. Historical records showed that Vietnamese have visited states and Sultanates consisting of modern-day Malaysia in small numbers since the 18th century, and Malaysia is currently home to a large Vietnamese expatriate community consisting of migrant workers, mail order brides and students numbering around 100,000 people. Vietnam also hosts a small Malaysian expatriate community, consisting mostly of businessmen based in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.
History.
Early contacts (15th-18th century).
The earliest record between present day Malaysia and Vietnam date back to 1469. Soldiers from Tonkin had captured a Malaccan tributary mission en route to China, killing some and castrating and enslaving the survivors. In the incident, the Tonkin expressed their intent to conquer Malacca, which was conveyed to the Chinese emperor in a later mission in 1481. The Chinese emperor ordered Malacca to raise soldiers in the event of a similar attack. The Malay Annals also mentioned of a Cham prince bringing some of his followers to form a small Cham colony in Malacca when Vietnam invaded Champa in 1471, and deploying military assistance to Johor to fend off a botched military conquest in the 1590s. In the mid 17th-century, the Cham vassal state of Panduranga and Kelantan cultivated close diplomatic ties when they led a long-term diplomatic mission to Kelantan in order to learn more about Malay culture and Islam. Subsequent kings after Po Rome, beginning with his son Po Saut, periodically received Malay Muslim missionaries from Kelantan in the 17th and 18th century.
British colonial era (18th-mid 20th century).
Not long after the establishment of Penang by the British as a port at the end of the 18th century, Vietnam junks began to visit the area for trade at the instruction of the Vietnamese emperor in Hue. An early account showed Nguyen Anh's (later Emperor Gia Long) merchant ship docking in Penang in the late 1790s carrying cargoes of sugarcane en route to India. Early Annamite visitors included merchants, soldiers referred to Penang in its Sino-Vietnamese terminology, Tan-lang-du (Chinese: 槟榔屿); a royal narrative in 1810 showed that the Vietnamese began to refer to Penang as Cu Lao Cau, literally meaning Palm Island. Vietnamese Catholics also travelled to Penang to pursue seminary studies from the 1840s, these included illuminaries such as Pétrus Ky. To the east in the Sultanate of Terengganu, ethnic Chinese from Cochinchina had sailed there to engage in poultry and rice trading. Some had also settled down and assimilated with the local Chinese.
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Ho Chi Minh played a key role in facilitating the formation of the Nanyang Communist Party (later renamed as the Malayan Communist Party; MCP) and visited Malaya on several occasions, notably an official ceremony marking the formation of the Malayan Communist Party in Buloh Kasap, Johor in April 1930. Ho Chi Minh's influence in the MCP facilitated the entry and subsequent appointment of Lai Teck, who is also of Vietnamese origin as the MCP's Secretary General in 1934 and 1938 respectively. Collaboration and communications between the MCP and the Vietnamese Communists increased following Lai Teck's disappearance in the late 1940s; and the MCP had briefly facilitated the shipping and transport of light ammunitions to the Viet Minh around this time. While in World War II, both the Viet Minh and Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) were against the Japanese invasion of French Indochina and Malaya. Closer ties between Communist cadres from Malaya and Vietnam were forged following successful efforts by the Communist victory at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, and the Viet Minh provided small-scale logistical and communication support and training to the MCP in the 1950s and 1960s.
Vietnamese refugees (1975–2005).
The Fall of Saigon in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War saw the first Vietnamese refugees escaping in boats beginning in 1975. The first refugee boat arrived in Malaysia in May 1975 carrying 47 people, although the number of refugees landing on Malaysia remained small until 1978 when the Vietnamese government imposed a policy of confiscating private property from the South Vietnamese. As a result, a large number of Vietnamese, mostly those of Chinese descent fled en masse from the country. Governmental statistics indicated that Malaysia hosted 19,000 refugees in November 1978, as compared to 500 in 1977. The Malaysian Home Ministry established Federal Task Force VII in 1978 to limit the rising number of refugees landing in Malaysia, and the press indicated incidences whereby they were turned away by Malaysian police and army. In response, Vietnamese refugees landing in Malaysia resorted to deliberately sinking their boats to gain admittance onto Malaysian shores. When such tactics were made known to the government, then Deputy Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad announced in June 1979 that legislation would be enacted to empower the police and navy to shoot Vietnamese refugees attempting to land on Malaysia, although Mahathir's superior, Prime Minister Hussein Onn quickly recanted Mahathir's shooting threat.
The first Vietnamese refugee camp was established in Pulau Bidong in August 1978 with United Nations assistance and 25,000 refugees quickly populated the island. Other refugee camps were also set up at Pulau Tengah, Pulau Besar, Kota Bharu, Kuantan, Sarawak and Sabah. A transit centre was also established at Sungei Besi in 1982 where refugees would be housed, awaiting deportation to Western countries willing to accept them. The number of Vietnamese refugees arrivals saw a fluctuating pattern of increases and decreases between 1981 and 1983, before a period of significant decrease from 1984 to 1986. In 1987, Malaysia and other neighbouring countries witnessed a surge in the number of Vietnamese refugees landing on Malaysia. Members countries of ASEAN voiced their displeasure at a summit in June 1987 to the Vietnamese government for turning a blind eye on the refugees from leaving Vietnam. A year later in August 1988, Malaysia and Vietnam jointly formulated an involuntary repatriation whereby Vietnamese refugees would be persuaded to return home. A few Vietnamese government delegations conducted outreach sessions at some of the refugee camps, which was considered unsuccessful as less than 40 individuals registered for the voluntary repatriation programme between 1980 and 1989. A dateline was set on 14 March 1989 whereby all Vietnamese who arrived prior to the date would be automatically considered as refugees and all refugees that arrived after that date would undergo a screening process to assess if they qualify for refugee status. The screening process was formulated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in June 1988. The process involved thorough background checks on refugees to determine if they qualify for such status to be sent to any Western countries who are willing to accept them. Some 4,000 out of 9,000 refugees were sent off to Western countries within 10 months. However, in the same measure of time, an additional 11,000 refuges arrived in Malaysia.
The implementation of stringent rules that require Vietnamese refugees to qualify for the status prompted a few of them to opt for the voluntary repatriation programme; between 1,000 to 2,000 refugees from Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989 alone. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. As Vietnam began to witness economic growth in the early 1990s, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia quickly dropped. The joint collaboration efforts between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the refugee problem enabled Malaysia to quickly downsize its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong refugee camp in November 1991. Some 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme, and Malaysia was able to downsize its refugee populace to some 6,000 individuals by 1994. Most of its remaining refugees were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants. However, the majority of the remaining refugees expressed a reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam, and demonstrations and rioting ensued when news of its impending closure broke out in 1995. Sungei Besi refugee camp was later closed in June 1996. The last Vietnamese refugee left Malaysia for Vietnam in 2005.
Diplomatic ties.
Malaysia established diplomatic ties with North Vietnam on 31 March 1973 at the ambassadorial level, following the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in 1973. An agreement was reached between the two countries' ambassadors in 1975, and the following year, Malaysia first opened its embassy in Hanoi, while Vietnam opened its embassy in Kuala Lumpur on 29 May 1976. Attempts to nurture close bilateral ties were not very successful in the mid to late 1970s, as Vietnam was unhappy with Malaysia's insistence on coaxing the former to embrace the ZOPFAN concept, which was interpreted by Vietnam as an version of the anti-communist Containment policy. Prime Minister Hussein Onn had once nostalgised Vietnam's Communist regime as one that has a common goal of eliminating colonialism in the region during bilateral summit in August 1977, and also promised to provide economic and technical assistance to rebuild the then-war torn economy. However, relations quickly soured when Vietnam invaded Cambodia, coupled with the influx of refugees into Malaysia in the late 1970s and 1980s which posed economic and national security issues as a result. Bilateral ties normalised from 1988 onwards when Vietnam announced plans to withdraw from Cambodia. In the early 1990s, government leaders of both countries held numerous diplomatic visits and summits which saw many deals and agreements with a key emphasis on economic co-operation and development. Warming ties also saw the opening of a consulate office in Ho Chi Minh City in January 1991. Vietnam also expressed its interest to join ASEAN with Malaysia's support in 1994 as both countries continued to foster close economic ties with each other. Vietnam later joined ASEAN in 1995, whose entry was warmly welcomed by Malaysia.
Bilateral ties was heavily characterised by trade and economic co-operation in the 1990s, and other areas of bilateral co-operation were explored from 2000 onwards. In that year, an agreement on bilateral efforts in the suppression of trans-national drug trade and law enforcement. A summit in 2004 also saw the signing of three MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding), namely in whereby the areas of Information and Technology, Education and Diplomatic ties and co-operation in general. Bilateral cooperation between both countries was also extended to defence matters in 2008 when another MoU was signed whereby the Malaysian and Vietnamese armed forces would participate in joint military training and collaboration in the defence industry. Emphasis would be given to maritime security whereby Vietnamese fishermen have encroached Malaysian waters for fishing activities and piracy control.
Relations with South Vietnam (1959–1975).
Formal relations between Malaya and South Vietnam was established in 1959 following a bilateral summit between Tunku Abdul Rahman and Ngo Dinh Diem a year earlier. An agreement was reached between Malaya and South Vietnam to establish their respective embassies in Kuala Lumpur and Saigon respectively in 1960, although the plan did not materialise until 1964, by which time Malaya was renamed Malaysia. Malaysia was very supportive of supported American involvement in the Vietnam War for fear that a Communist victory in Vietnam would threaten Malaysia's existence in accordance to the Domino theory. Tunku Abdul Rahman expressed these concerns in December 1966 and called on the United States and United Kingdom to provide increased logistical support to war efforts in Vietnam. Malaysia hosted public administration and jungle warfare training courses to government officials, and provided motorcycles to bolster the South Vietnamese police and military logistical capabilities. Towards the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, Malaysia closed its embassy in two stages, first with the withdrawal of the embassy dependants on 12 April 1975, before a complete closure 16 days later, 2 days before the fall of Saigon. Malaysia had also extended recognition to the short-lived Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam within days of its formation in May 1975, citing the former's impartial position on political ideaology and social system.
Embassy.
The Embassy of Malaysia in Hanoi is currently located at 43-45 Dien Bien Phu Street, which it has been located since 2004. Malaysia also has a Consular Office in Ho Chi Minh City that was opened in 1991, and its executive functions was later upgraded to that of Consular-General one year later. The Malaysian embassy in Hanoi has shifted three times since 1976:
The Vietnamese embassy in Kuala Lumpur is located at 4 Persiaran Stonor and was opened in 1976 through the acquisition of the former South Vietnamese embassy. The Vietnamese embassy also has separate offices catering to labour and defence matters in two separate locations within Kuala Lumpur set up in the 2000s. In February 2013, the Vietnamese embassy secured the purchase of of land in Precinct 15, Putrajaya that would be used for the construction and subsequent relocation of the Vietnamese embassy.
Economic trade.
Bilateral trade between Malaysia and Vietnam stood at $2.2 million following the conclusion of the Vietnam War in 1975. Within the first three years following the end of the Vietnam War, Malaysia quickly proposed to extend economic and technical assistance to the war torn country in the oil palm and rubber industries. Malaysia exported zinc with Vietnam and also signed a contract that would facilitate the import of Vietnamese vegetables into Malaysia. These early co-operations and proposals quickly fizzled out following Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1979. Economic co-operation slowly resumed from 1988 onwards when bilateral trade between the 2 countries stood at a mere $50 million. In 1990, bilateral trade increased to $140 million and to $235 million in 1991. Around this time, Malaysian businessmen began to open hotels in Vung Tau to cater to its flourishing tourism industry. At a bilateral summit in 1992, both countries agreed on the idea of joint oil and gas exploration, which Vietnam owns a sizeable number of oil fields in the South China Sea.
The warming of bilateral ties also saw the first Malaysian statuory boards and Government-linked companies including Bank Negara, MIDAS and Petronas to provide technical assistance programmes for the Vietnam. Vietnam also sought Malaysia's assistance to develop its banking sector, and Malaysia's Public Bank formed joint ventures with VID bank (later BIDV bank) to open branches in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City between 1993 and 1994. By 1994, Malaysia became ASEAN's second largest investor in Vietnam. The variety of exports from Vietnam to Malaysia mainly consisted of rice, rubber, oil seeds and machinery, while Malaysia exported machinery equipment and chemicals which were mainly derived from the former's economic assistance to the country. Malaysian businessmen were also responsible for the development of the An Don Export Processing Zone beginning in 1994 in Danang. At an APEC meeting in 1994, then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad spoke of the belief that Malaysia need not be totally self-reliant on its food needs, and expressed his interest to procure some food from Vietnam as a means of strengthening economic ties. Two years later, Malaysian-made Proton Wira cars were first sold in Vietnam.
A joint commission meeting between the two countries in 1996 saw the arrival of skilled and semi-skilled workers entering Vietnam from Malaysia in the late 1990s. Between 2002 and 2003, Malaysia saw the first wave of Vietnamese workers coming to Malaysia to provide for its labour demand in its expanding its manufacturing sector. By 2003, there were 67,000 Vietnamese workers in Malaysia and both countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding which exempted unskilled Vietnamese workers to having master a sufficient grasp of English or the Malay language to qualify for employment. The number of Vietnamese work permit holders increased slightly to 80,000-90,000 by 2011, and their presence later expanded to other sectors including construction, housekeeping, agriculture and service sectors. A few Vietnamese workers also found employment in Chinese restaurants as waiters, picking up some command of the Chinese language along the way.
Social developments.
A sizeable number of Malaysian men have foreign wives. According to statistics provided by the Malaysian National Registry Department, one third of these are Vietnamese. Accounts of such marriages first surfaced in the 1990s, but it was not until the 2000s when such marriages became especially popular with older Chinese Malaysian men. A thriving matchmaking industry has since surfaced whereby prospective grooms could select their Vietnamese brides based on road shows and profiling methods. Malaysian spouses cited the inability to find a local spouse due to career commitments, and cultural affinity between Chinese Malaysians and Vietnamese as their main motivations for finding a Vietnamese wife. Couples of such unions have faced considerable issues, such as language barriers, cases of wives abandoning their Malaysian spouses and bringing along their mixed-race children back to Vietnam, and extortion. A Chinese community leader, Michael Chong, suggested that the key reason for runaway Vietnamese brides was their inability to adapt to Malaysian life and society, and that many of the women married with the intention of escaping poverty in their homeland.
Malaysia is also home to close to 100,000 Vietnamese nationals, mostly concentrated in the industrial hubs in West Malaysia such as Penang, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, and Johor. Vietnamese migrant workers have occasionally been mistreated by employers, and have faced overcrowded dormitories, salary deductions, and physical abuse at work. A sizeable number of crimes in Malaysia, including robbery, rape, murder, and prostitution have attributed to the Vietnamese community. Former Inspector General Musa Hassan claimed that the Malaysian police had handled more than 200 cases of crime involving the Vietnamese community in 2008. Vietnamese women are common in the Malaysia prostitution trade, and Malaysian clients have attributed their alluring physique and good hospitality practices to their success. Some Vietnamese prostitutes have reportedly resorted to registering false student passes or false marriages with local men in order to gain employment in this trade, and many were forced into prostitution after being tricked by unscrupulous agents promising them employment as waitresses or factory workers in Malaysia.

Healing Through Remembering

Healing Through Remembering (HTR) is an extensive cross-community project in Northern Ireland, made up of a diverse range of individual members with different political perspectives and social experiences.
HTR aims at comprehensive involvement of all stakeholders to investigate the feasibility, viability and usefulness of remembering the Troubles and in so doing both individually and collectively contribute to building a better future for all[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-12858276_ITM]. Through ongoing internal discussions, research, round table discussions, conferences and outreach programmes, HTR has produced a range of reports, options papers, discussion papers and audits which continue to inform discussion throughout society – this includes community groups, political parties, statutory and Government policy makers.
The object of Healing Through Remembering is to promote, for the benefit of the public in Northern Ireland, the advancement of education in the purpose and methods of mediation, conciliation and reconciliation of disputes or conflicts and of all the means of managing them for peaceful resolution in the interests of good citizenship and community relations and in particular to promote research and the exchange of views that help towards education into the causes, prevention and alleviation of destructive patterns of behaviour and into peaceful means of resolving conflict.
Members come from across Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland and have been meeting over the past number of years to focus on the issue of how to deal with the past relating to the conflict in and about Northern Ireland.
History.
In March 2000 the All Truth is Bitter Report was launched. It documented the visit of Dr. Alex Boraine to Northern Ireland in February 1999 and recommended wide-ranging discussion to explore and debate ways of examining the past and processes of remembering so as to build a better future.
A number of individuals were invited by the authors of All Truth is Bitter to form a Board. After much discussion, in June 2001 a diverse group of individuals agreed to become the Healing Through Remembering Project Board and carry forward the work of the project.
Public consultation.
HTR carried out an extensive consultation in 2002 which asked individuals, organisations and communities "How should people remember the events connected with the conflict in and about Northern Ireland and in so doing, individually and collectively contribute to the healing of the wounds of society?
Healing Through Remembering Report 2002.
In June 2002 HTR published the findings of the consultation in the form of the Healing Through Remembering Report. This report made six recommendations:
Healing Through Remembering Initiative.
The organisation has established five Sub Groups to engage in dialogue and discussion and carry out research to fully examine the recommendations of the 2002 Report.
Storytelling Sub Group.
The Storytelling group considers how a collective oral narrative might work as vehicle for dealing with the past.
The group is developing the parameters for research into the impact of Storytelling.
The Storytelling Sub Group has carried out and published an audit of storytelling initiatives related to the conflict, hosted a one-day conference on the theme of “Storytelling as the Vehicle?” and published a report of the conference.
The Sub Group is currently working on producing a Good Practice Guide to Storytelling incorporating the values, definitions and core principles of storytelling.
Day of Reflection Sub Group.
The Day of Reflection group considers how best the conflict can be collectively remembered and reflected upon.
The first Day of Private Reflection took place on Thursday 21 June 2007. The purpose of the day is to "Provide an opportunity for people to remember the events of the past in a non-confrontational, dignified and respectful manner." Healing Through Remembering and its Day of Reflection Sub Group took time to carefully consider and plan the day to bring it to fruition. A free-phone telephone support line was made available before, during and after the day. The Day of Private Reflection was launched in March 2007 and received considerable media interest and attention. Interest and support for the Day of Private Reflection came from all sections of the community. There was widespread support in favour of a second Day of Private Reflection, with Healing Through Remembering as the lead organisation. A full and independent evaluation of the day was commissioned and is scheduled for publication in March 2008. The sub-group also held a residential which took place in September 2007.
A full range of materials to help raise awareness of the Day of Private Reflection and aid reflection on the Day have been produced and are available to order free of charge from HTR or via www.dayofreflection.com
Groups and individuals are also encouraged to develop their own materials and resources.
The Day of Reflection Sub Group carried out extensive research on international experiences of days of remembrance before proceeding with plans for an initial Day of Private Reflection on 21 June 2007.
Living Memorial Museum Sub Group.
The Living Memorial Museum group considers what form a living memorial and museum might take.
The form of the Living Memorial Museum is still under discussion.
The Living Memorial Museum Sub Group has commissioned an extensive audit of artefacts relating to the conflict which are held in existing archives and personal collections.
Dr. Kris Brown is conducting the audit which is being carried out through a joint Fellowship post at QUB.
The group has also conducted an Open Call for Ideas on what form a Living Memorial Museum to the conflict could take. A wide range of submissions were received and plans are underway for displaying them and generating further ideas.
Commemoration Sub Group.
The Commemoration Sub Group is currently examining the issues relating to commemoration and commissioned research on the subject to inform their thinking on possible ways forward.
The research considered: what is commemoration and what is its role in societies emerging from conflict?
A roundtable event on similar issues was held in January 2007. The Sub Group is currently finalising its strategic plan and considering future directions for the group.
Truth Recovery & Acknowledgement Sub Group.
The Network of Commemoration group examines the role of commemoration post conflict.
The Sub Group is continuing to host partnership events with interested organisations and groups on both the report and the issue of truth recovery.
The Truth Recovery and Acknowledgement Sub Group has undertaken two large pieces of work to date. The first, a scoping study on the current positions of key organisations, institutions and parties relating to acknowledgement of their role in the conflict was used to inform a discussion paper and proposal on what form acknowledgement might take. The paper, Acknowledgement and its Role in Preventing Future Violence, was published in October 2006.
The second piece of research developed by the group was a document on possible options for truth recovery. The document, Making Peace with the Past: Options for truth recovery regarding the conflict in and about Northern Ireland, was launched on 31 October 2006. Since the publication of the report the Sub Group has hosted a series of open meetings on the issue of truth recovery across Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. These open meetings concluded at the end of April.
Consultants Database.
Details of any research being commissioned by Healing Through Remembering on behalf of the Sub Groups is circulated to all researchers and facilitators who are listed on the Healing Through Remembering Consultants Database.

Lal Suhanra National Park

Lal Sohanra is a national park of Pakistan situated in Bahawalpur district of Punjab province, which is one of the largest nationals parks in South Asia. Lal Sohanra is spread over 153000 acre and is notable for the diversity of its landscape, which includes areas of desert, forest and water.
Geography and wildlife.
The park itself is situated some 35 kilometres east of Bahawalpur and presents a synthesis of forest and desert life. It occupies land on both sides of Desert Branch canal, and is spread over an area of 127,480 acres (51,368 hectares) - out of which 20,974 acres (8,491 hectares) are green land (irrigated plantations), 101,726 acres (40,942 hectares) are dry land (desert), and 4,780 acres are wet land (ponds and lakes). The park's terrain is generally flat, interspersed with sand dunes measuring between 1 and 6 meters in height and occupying as many as thousands of acres apiece.
Many species of animals can be found throughout the park. These include several wild animals of the desert such as wildcats, rabbits, bustards, and deer. Reptiles in the park include the Monitor lizard, Russell's Viper, Indian Cobra, Saw-scaled Viper, Wolf Snake, John's Sand Boa, and Spiny-tailed Lizard. More than 160 species of birds are also present, including the Houbara Bustard, Griffon Vulture, Crested Honey Buzzard, Marsh Harrier, Hen Harrier, Laggar Falcon, Peregrine Falcon, Kestrel, Eurasian Sparrowhawk, Egyptian Vulture, Lark, Shrike, Wheatear, and Barn Owl. Lake Patisar, a large body of water in the center of the park, is ideal for bird watching. In mid-winter, the lake is regularly home to between 10,000 and 30,000 ducks and common coot.
Attractions.
The Punjab government has plans to convert the Lal Sohanra National Park into a wildlife safari park of international standard. One of its most prominent attractions is currently the lion safari, which allows guests to see lions in their natural habitat at close range. In addition, the park's captive breeding suite holds a pair of Rhinoceros which were given by Nepal. Rhinos were once found as far west as the Peshawar Valley during the reign of Mughal Emperor Babur, but are now extinct in Pakistan and western India.
Over 400 animals are currently being bred in the Lal Sohanra Park, including a large population of Blackbucks, a breed of antelope most notable for its pronounced sexual dimorphism. The park is constantly supplied with new Blackbucks in order to extend its efforts toward Blackbuck conservation.

Skorovatn

Skorovatn is a village in the municipality of Namsskogan in Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway. The old Skorovas Gruber mine is here, but it closed in 1984. Skorovatn is located on the border of the municipality of Røyrvik, just south of the lake Tunnsjøflyan and the large lake Tunnsjøen. It is about east of the main European route E6 highway that crosses Namsskogan. Skorovatn Chapel is located in the village.
Mine.
The "Skorovas Gruber" mine was the first in Norway to exploit a sulphide ore deposit and produced zinc and copper. The mine discharged tailings into a nearby lake, but the contamination from this process has been deemed relatively slight. The mine closed in 1984. Before its closing, virtually everyone that lived in and around Skorovatn worked directly or indirectly for the mining operation.

Chinese people in Pakistan

The Chinese people in Pakistan () comprise one of the country's significant expatriate communities. There were estimated to be 10,000 Chinese people living and working in Pakistan .
Distribution.
Karachi.
During the 1940s many Chinese Muslims fled unrest in China and settled in Karachi. However the Chinese community there is primarily of non-Muslim origins; their ancestors were Buddhists, but subsequent generations follow other religions or none at all. About 30% are estimated to have converted to Islam. 
Most Chinese in Karachi are second generation children of immigrants—the oldest generation have mostly died off, while the third generation have emigrated to other countries. Common destinations for emigrants are the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, or to their ancestral country China. They rarely wear Chinese clothing, but still retain the Chinese language, though in recent years they have shown increasing language shift towards Urdu. Previously, the community was segregated by provincial origin, but with the establishment of a Chinese Committee to represent the community, they have become more integrated. They are concentrated in a few neighbourhoods, including near the PECHS and Tariq Road, as well as Saddar and more recently Clifton and Defence neighbourhoods in Saddar Town. The Clifton and Defense Society areas has about 15 Chinese restaurants; the area is sometimes unofficially referred to as "Chinatown". One of the more well-known of these, the ABC Chinese Restaurant, founded by Li Dianxian (李殿贤) in the 1930s, was once patronised by Zhou Enlai, and continued operating until 1988.
Common professions include beauticians, shoemakers, dentists, and the restaurant trade; most members of the second generation tend to follow the same trade as their parents did. Chinese dentists in particular have a reputation for providing quality service to the low-income residents of the city. Yet many of them are unlicensed and lack any formal training in dentistry. Instead, many of their parents had previously lived among the Chinese community in Malaysia and worked as dental assistants; when they came to Pakistan in the 1940s, they began practicing as full dentists themselves. There was a shortage of dentists in Karachi at that time, as there was only one dental school in the entire province of Sindh, at Hyderabad. They primarily provided simple procedures such as manufacture and fitting of dentures as well as extraction of teeth; however, in later years, some prospered enough that they were able to hire formally trained dentists to provide more complex procedures.
Other areas.
In Lahore, Chinese Muslims established a mosque called the "Chini Masjid" (Chinese Mosque). They typically intermarried with local people and assimilated. The two Chinese shoemakers there, Hopson and Kingson, had a reputation for high quality. Many Chinese people can be seen in Lahore visiting the Anarkali food-street.
In Islamabad, the Phoenix restaurant has become well-known. Their clientele includes Pervez Musharraf and ex-president Shaukat Aziz; Musharraf is said to enjoy their, Peking duck, stir-fried beef, and garlic lamb chops. The Faisal Mosque has many Chinese visitors as well.
There is a Chinese cemetery in Gilgit which contains the graves of Chinese workers who died during the construction of the Karakoram Highway in Pakistan during the 1960s and 1970s.
Migrant workers.
Despite the emigration of members of older communities, the Chinese population in Pakistan has been bolstered by new expatriate residents. However, the growth in their population was somewhat interrupted by the September 11, 2001, attacks; fearful that war could break out in Pakistan, most Chinese residents sent their wives and children back home. , there were roughly 3,500 Chinese engineers temporarily residing in Pakistan for work on various state-run projects in various locations, especially in the construction of the Gwadar Port. Their total number might have been as high as 5,000. About 1,200 were estimated to reside in Islamabad. Then, between 2008 and 2009, the number of Chinese working in Pakistan grew sharply, to an estimated 10,000, even as expatriate workers of other nationalities left the country.
Ethnic minorities.
Some members of ethnic minorities of China, primarily Muslim Uyghurs and Tajiks from Xinjiang, have also settled in the northern parts of Pakistan. The earliest migrants, numbering in the thousands, came in the 1940s in fear of communist persecution. A few hundred more fled to Pakistan in the aftermath of a failed uprising in Khotan in 1954. Later waves of migration came in 1963 and again in 1974. Beginning in the 1980s, more Uyghurs who had left China to go on the "hajj" began settling in Pakistan instead of returning to China.
Organisations.
There are Chinese community organisations in a number of Pakistani cities:
Because of the various threats to Chinese workers in Pakistan, the Chinese embassy have also formed a liaison committee with the Pakistani government to look into safety issues.

List of UNICEF National Committees

There are UNICEF National Committees in 36 industrialised countries worldwide, each established as an independent local non-governmental organization. Serving as the public face and dedicated voice of UNICEF, the National Committees raise funds from the private sector, promote children’s rights, and secure worldwide visibility for children threatened by poverty, disasters, armed conflict, abuse and exploitation.
UNICEF is funded exclusively by voluntary contributions, and the National Committees collectively raise around one-third of UNICEF's annual income. This comes through contributions from corporations, civil society organizations and more than 6 million individual donors worldwide. They also rally many different partners – including the media, national and local government officials, NGOs, specialists such as doctors and lawyers, corporations, schools, young people and the general public – on issues related to children’s rights.

<doc id="21605848" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21605848" title="Yōkaiden">
Yōkaiden

Yōkaiden is an on-going Original English-language manga written and illustrated by Nina Matsumoto and published by Del Rey Manga. The story features Hamachi, a boy fascinated by the Japanese monsters called "yokai". When one of these monsters steals his grandmother's soul, he travels into their world to retrieve it. The first volume was published on November 18, 2008, and as of November 24, 2009, two volumes were released.
Plot.
Although "yōkai" (a class of Japanese monsters) are feared and hunted, Hamachi believes that humans can peacefully coexist with the spirits. When Hamachi releases a "kappa" from one of his grandmother's traps, having to remove its leg to do so, it later returns for revenge against his grandmother and steals her soul. Hamachi then travels into the "yokai"'s world to retrieve her soul. However, he could end up trapped in the realm as well.
Production.
Nina Matsumoto has already received attention for various artworks in her DeviantArt gallery. After a deal with Bongo Comics and an interview with "The Toronto Star", she caught the attention of Dallas Middaugh an associate publisher at Del Rey Manga. After reading her web comic "Saturnalia", he asked her for a proposal and she created the initial "Yōkaiden" concept. Middaugh comments that the concept "was pretty much ready to go" without much change. Middaugh mentions that the protagonist Hamachi reminds him of Son Goku as he was portrayed in the original "Dragon Ball" series.
Reception.
"Yōkaiden" has been well received by critics. About.com's Deb Aoki considered it to be the best "original English language manga" of 2008, commending the series for having "well-developed characters that have interesting personalities and fun chemistry with each other." Coolstreak Cartoons' Leroy Douresseaux commends the artist for her artwork saying that it "has a lively, fluid feel similar to animation, while her character and creature design is quirky." Carlo Santos of Anime News Network feels the series has "a bold sense of line, striking visual designs and clearly defined layouts" and says that Matsumoto's strength is in her dialogue. However, Santos believes that the series "falls short of a truly haunting atmosphere" due to the humor, which sometimes breaks the fourth wall. Erin Finnegan of PopCultureShock says that she "can’t stop talking about how hilarious" "Yōkaiden" is; she also believes it is the best OEL/World manga of 2008. Brigid Alverson from GraphicNovelReporter.com comments that Matsumoto draws the characters with an exaggerated style, bringing out the characters’ personalities and depicting the odd creatures with imagination and flair. Alverson also says that a great deal of information is delivered "rather painlessly." She believes that those who enjoy "Pokémon" or Hayao Miyazaki's "Spirited Away" will enjoy "Yōkaiden".

List of astronauts educated at the United States Naval Academy

Over 50 United States astronauts have graduated from the United States Naval Academy (USNA), more than from any other undergraduate institution. The Naval Academy is an undergraduate college in Annapolis, Maryland with the mission of educating and commissioning officers for the United States Navy and Marine Corps. The Academy is often referred to as Annapolis. Sports media refer to the Academy as "Navy" and the students as "Midshipmen"; this usage is officially endorsed. During the latter half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, the United States Naval Academy was the primary source of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers, with the Class of 1881 being the first to provide officers to the Marine Corps. Graduates of the Academy are also given the option of entering the United States Army or United States Air Force. Most Midshipmen are admitted through the congressional appointment system. The curriculum emphasizes various fields of engineering. Annapolis graduates who enter aviation and space-related fields have the opportunity to be selected for astronaut training by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
This list is drawn from graduates of the Naval Academy who became astronauts. The Academy was founded in 1845 and graduated its first class in 1846. The first alumnus to fly as an astronaut was Alan Shepard, class of 1945. As of March 2009, the most recent alumni to become an astronaut was Christopher Cassidy, class of 1993. Two alumni were part of Project Mercury, three part of Project Gemini, seven part of the Apollo program, three have walked on the moon, one was part of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and forty-two were part of the Space Shuttle program.
In addition to the 52 astronauts who are alumni of the Academy, over 990 noted scholars from a variety of academic fields are Academy graduates, including 45 Rhodes Scholars and 16 Marshall Scholars. Additional notable graduates include 1 President of the United States, 2 Nobel Prize recipients, and 73 Medal of Honor recipients.

The Loading Zone

The Loading Zone was an American rock band of the late 1960s and early 1970s. They issued two albums worth of material, with differing band lineups, before disbanding in 1971.
Career.
They were formed in Oakland, California in 1966 by singer-keyboardist Paul Fauerso, following the dissolution of his jazz group The Tom Paul Trio. The original lineup was Fauerso, bassist Bob Kridle, drummer Ted Kozlowski (replaced by George Newcom), and guitarists Peter Shapiro and Steve Dowler, both formerly of Berkeley psychedelic rock band The Marbles, who had supported Jefferson Airplane at the historic "Tribute to Dr. Strange", the inaugural Family Dog promotion concert held at San Francisco's Longshoreman's Hall in October 1965.
The Loading Zone's first major concert was the Trips Festival at the Longshoreman's Hall in January 1966. Although primarily an R&B band, The Loading Zone added contemporary psychedelic influences and soon became a popular attraction on the burgeoning Bay Area music scene. The Loading Zone was based at the Berkeley venue The New Orleans House, but performed numerous times at major venues including the Fillmore West.
Although The Loading Zone occasionally headlined, the group is better known for supporting some of the biggest acts of the period including Cream, The Who, The Byrds, Big Brother & the Holding Company, Grateful Dead, Country Joe & The Fish, Howlin' Wolf, Sam & Dave, Chuck Berry and Buddy Miles.
In 1968 Fauerso placed an advertisement in the "San Francisco Chronicle" seeking a new lead vocalist, which led to the recruitment of Linda Tillery, who joined just prior to the band's signing with RCA Records. Despite their live popularity, the group lacked a strong base of original material; their self-titled debut album was poorly received, and was criticised for its excessive production and its reliance on cover versions. The Loading Zone was unable to garner support from radio, and eventually split in 1969.
In 1969, Fauerso re-formed the group with new members- guitarist Steve Busfield, bassist Mike Eggleston, and drummer George Marsh, and initially with previous horn players, Todd Anderson (tenor sax) and Patrick O'Hara (trombone). Anderson was replaced after a few months by Ron Taormina. The new Zone also recruited old friend and drummer, Frank Davis to play with the group for a while. During this brief period, the band performed with two drummers at the same time - Davis and Marsh - with some exciting results. The band recorded their second LP " One for All" for their own label, Umbrella, before disbanding in 1971.
Tillery released her solo debut album "Sweet Linda Divine" on CBS Records in 1970. It was produced by Al Kooper of Blood, Sweat and Tears fame. Fauerso went on to produce the unreleased Mike Love solo album "First Love" and more recently, a second entitled "Only One Earth". Fauerso went on to make recordings of new age music and also to compose and produce award-winning commercials for radio and TV. Tillery resurfaced with the jazz fusion group Cesar 830 before embarking on a solo career.
In 2005, Fauerso reconnected with Eggleston and Marsh to record a new Loading Zone CD entitled "Blue Flame" (available through CD Baby and iTunes) The album contains five new tracks and three cuts from the second Zone album, "One For All".
George Newcom died from a heart attack on July 1, 2010, in Red Bluff, California. He was 63 years old. Pat O'Hara, trombonist, later worked with Buddy Miles on "Cold Blood" and others, and died in the late 70's or early 80's of an overdose.

Liechtenstein heraldry

Liechtenstein heraldry is the form of heraldic art found in the country of Liechtenstein. It does not have a heraldic body of its own, relying on primarily German influences through the ruling house. It follows the German-Nordic tradition.
National coat of arms.
The coat-of-arms of the Princely House of Liechtenstein is also used as the great arms of the nation. As the sovereign emblem of the Principality of Liechtenstein, its use is reserved for the members of the Princely House and state authorities. Private individuals may be authorized to use the great arms, if it is in the interest of the State. The arms are a history of the Princely House, and show the many different areas of Europe with which Liechtenstein has been involved, either by conquest or by marriage.
It has been in use since around 1630. It is referred to in blazon as:
"Quarterly (1) Or an Eagle displayed Sable crowned and armed of the first charged with a crescent trefly Argent ending in crosses (2) Barry of eight Or and Sable charged with crancelin Vert (3) Per pale Gules and Argent (4) Or a maiden eagle displayed Sable the human part Argent crowned and armed of the first (Enty in point chapé) in base Azure a Hunting Horn stringed Or (Overall) An Escutcheon per fess Or and Gules"
The whole achievement (entire rendering with supporters) is surrounded by the Princely cloak, or mantle, Purpure and lined Ermine and ensigned with the Princely hat.
Municipal heraldry.
Each of the eleven municipalities of Liechtenstein bears a shield, which contain a wide range of heraldic features. The capital municipality, Vaduz, has the most complex, recognising its status as the home of the ruling house. Coats of arms such as that of Schaan are typical, with a two or three colour field and primary charge(s).

Galleon Group

The Galleon Group was one of the largest hedge fund management firms in the world, managing over $7 billion, before closing in October 2009. The firm was the center of a 2009 insider trading scandal.
The firm was founded by Raj Rajaratnam, a former equity research analyst and eventual president of Needham & Company, in 1997. The New York headquartered firm was named for the galleon, a large sailing ship used from the 16th to 18th centuries in Europe.
Insider trading investigation.
In October 2009 Rajaratnam and five others were arrested and charged with multiple counts of fraud and insider trading. Rajaratnam pleaded not guilty and remained free on $100 million bail, the largest in United States history. He was indicted by a grand jury in December 2009 and found guilty in U.S. District Court on 14 charges in May 2011. He was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell to 11 years in prison on October 13th, 2011.
Other former and current traders at Galleon were subsequently arrested and charged with contributing to the alleged conspiracy. Several former employees of the firm have cooperated in the investigation. As of January 2012 over fifty people have been convicted or pleaded guilty to date in the sprawling probe stemming from Galleon (not all of them Galleon employees).
Zvi Goffer, an ex-Galleon Group LLC trader, was found guilty of all 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud against him and sentenced by Judge Sullivan "to 10 years in prison for his role in a scheme to trade on inside information provided by lawyers". Goffer had asked for a lenient sentence and prosecutors had recommended more than 10 years.
Adam Smith, an ex-Galleon Group LLC trader, pleaded guilty and cooperated in the criminal trial of Raj Rajaratnam. He was sentenced in June 2012 to only a period of probation and no jail time by Judge Jed Rakoff, who took over the case from Judge Richard Holwell when the latter retired from the bench.

The building was completed in 1923 after almost a decade of construction, which was protracted by World War I and the resulting shortages of construction materials. At the time of its opening, it was the largest building in Perth.
History.
Previous postal services.
In the first year of the colony, the harbourmaster was appointed to perform the postal services for the colony. A General Post Office was proclaimed in St Georges Terrace in 1835, and in 1841 a Postmaster General was appointed. The colonial Posts and Telegraph Department took over control of Perth's telegraph services in 1871, and telephone services in 1889. The Perth General Post Office was relocated to St Georges Terrace between 1887 and 1890, however by 1910 this accommodation was inadequate for the services provided. In 1900 there were 175 post offices across Western Australia, together with 160 telephone exchanges. The Commonwealth took over control of postal and telecommunication services at Federation in 1901.
Construction.
On 28 November 1911, the Commonwealth Government bought of land across Wellington Street from the Perth railway station. This land stretched to Murray Street and featured an "unhealthy" shopping arcade named Central Arcade. The land was to be used as a Commonwealth Government precinct, allowing the Commonwealth departments to move out of the cramped Treasury Buildings at the corner of St Georges Terrace and Barrack Street, which it shared with the State Government. A proposal was made in 1912 for a wide street through the site featuring a new General Post Office building.
Principal Architect (Western Australia) Hillson Beasley visited Melbourne, where he worked with Commonwealth Architect John Smith Murdoch to design the new General Post Office building. Architectural plans were drawn up and the construction contract with C. W. Arnott signed on 7 July 1914 at a cost of £232,700. These original plans provided for five storeys above ground level, in addition to a basement.
Construction commenced in mid-1914, and initially experienced a delay due to sandy soil on the site. The foundation stone was laid by Minister for Home Affairs W. O. Archibald on 8 October 1915. The subsequent outbreak of World War I led to a significant delay in the building's construction. The steel to be used in the construction became subject to an embargo by the British Government in 1916. An alternative supply was finally sourced from Broken Hill Proprietary in 1920. Construction was later delayed due to a six-month engineers' strike. The flooring and fittings were originally to be Australian blackwood, however Murdoch substituted jarrah which could be locally sourced.
William Hardwick succeeded Beasley as the Principal Architect in 1917 and oversaw the project from that point until its completion. Although the end date given in the construction contract was October 1917, the building was not nearing completion and this term in the contract was waived. Over the course of construction, the design of the building had been modified several times, largely in an effort to reduce costs. In 1921 it was resolved to add a further two storeys to the top of the building for use by other Commonwealth departments. These additional storeys were to be walled with brickwork, rather than the stone used to clad the rest of the building's facade. However, the side and rear walls of the building were also of brick, and so the brick attic storey "tied in" with these treatments.
The General Post Office was officially opened on 26 September 1923 after around nine years of protracted construction, at a total cost of £400,000.
The new street in front of the building was ceremonially opened on the same day, and named "Forrest Place" in honour of the late Sir John Forrest, Western Australia's first Premier. At its opening, the new General Post Office was Perth's largest building, and it has been said that its imposing design proclaimed "the might of the new Commonwealth".
Subsequent history.
The Commonwealth precinct expanded with subsequent construction of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia building immediately south of the General Post Office. It was officially opened on 22 March 1933 by Sir Robert Gibson. It was designed in a similar style to the General Post Office by the architectural staff of the bank, and built by A. Douglas for a tender price of £207,000. The building featured cornice lines and columns of the same style as the General Post Office. Another similarly-styled Commonwealth department was planned for the General Post Office's northern side; this was not constructed for many decades, and did not emulate the design of the General Post Office.
Forrest Place was closed to traffic in the late 1980s as part of the Forrest Chase development. The Padbury Buildings on the eastern side of Forrest Place, which had been constructed in 1925, were demolished, and the newly created pedestrian mall featured basement parking and loading docks for the General Post Office. The widening of Forrest Place has effectively created a town square dominated by the General Post Office building.
The General Post Office was recognised for its heritage value by interim listing on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places on 22 June 1992; it received a permanent entry on the Register on 16 October 1992.
Design.
The architecture of the General Post Office building has been referred to as High Edwardian Classical and a "free treatment of the Greek Renaissance". It features a neo-classical facade, featuring Donnybrook stone (a sandstone), including large paired Ionic columns, rising above an arcade lined with Mahogany Creek Granite facing. At the time of its opening, the building was considered to be "by far the most ornate structure in the city".
The interior of the General Post Office was similarly well-finished, with jarrah features throughout. An estimated 600,000 jarrah blocks were used in the herringbone-pattern flooring. The ground floor is fronted by a large colonnade along its entire width. The main postal hall was two storeys high, with balconies from the first floor above. The postal hall also featured a frosted glass roof, above which a lightwell reached to the top of the building.
The basement of the General Post Office accommodated vaults and was also used for the handling of bulk parcels. The first floor served as the Mail Room, while the second floor housed executive offices. The third floor housed the State Engineer in addition to the managers and operators of the telephone and telegraph systems. The telegraph operating room was connected to the ground floor by pneumatic tubes. The fourth and fifth floors of the building were originally home to the Taxation Department, and the sixth floor was home to miscellaneous other Federal departments, as well as providing accommodation for Federal Members of Parliament. On the seventh floor was a staff dining room and rest areas.
The General Post Office is founded on 1,525 piles in groups of 25, each pile long and in diameter. The building featured four passenger lifts and two goods lifts. The building is constructed by a concrete-encased steel frame, faced with stone and brick. The brick walls did not receive a particularly favourable reception upon the building's opening:

Aspidistra elatior

Aspidistra elatior (cast-iron plant or bar room plant) also known in Japanese as "haran" or "baran" (葉蘭) is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to Japan and Taiwan. Tolerant of neglect, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant, but can also be grown outside in shade where temperatures remain above .
Description.
Growing to tall and wide, it is an evergreen rhizomatous perennial, with glossy dark green leaves long, and fleshy, 8-lobed cream flowers with maroon colouring on the inner surface, borne in early summer.
Distribution.
Although sometimes thought to be of Chinese origin, the species is in fact native to Taiwan and islands in southern Japan including Kuroshima, Suwanosejima and the Uji Islands. It occurs in association with overstorey species such as "Ardisia sieboldii" and "Castanopsis sieboldii".
Cultivation.
"Aspidistra elatior" is well known in cultivation and has a reputation for withstanding neglect, giving rise to its common name of cast-iron plant. It is tolerant of low light, low humidity, temperature fluctuation and irregular watering. It is best situated in a position away from direct sun to avoid leaf bleaching. Good drainage is also required for optimal growth and to avoid root rot.
Widely grown as a house plant, it can also be grown successfully outdoors in shade in temperate climates, where plants will generally cope with temperatures down to , being killed by frosts of or below.
The species is not seriously troubled by insects, however mites and scale may cause occasional problems. Its leaves and roots may be subject to browsing by hoofed mammals such as deer, as well as rodents and rabbits.
This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
A number of cultivars are available, including:

1957 Aquila Airways Solent crash

The 1957 Aquila Airways Solent crash was a 15 November 1957 aircraft accident on the Isle of Wight, in England. With 45 lives lost, at the time it was the second worst crash within the United Kingdom.
Accident sequence.
The aircraft, an Aquila Airways Short Solent 3 flying boat named the "City of Sydney", registered G-AKNU, departed Southampton Water at 22:46 on a flight to Las Palmas and Madeira via Lisbon. At 22:54 the crew radioed to report that the number 4 propeller had been feathered ("No. 4 engine feathered. Coming back in a hurry." ). During an attempt to return, the Solent crashed into a disused chalk pit adjacent to heavily forested downland. The crash site is on a steep eastern slope of Shalcombe Down, above the small villages of Chessell and Shalcombe. 
At the time of impact the plane was banked 45 degrees to the right, the same side of the aircraft that had lost all engine power according the accident report. Except for the tail, the aircraft was destroyed. Of the 50 passengers and eight crew on board, 45 were killed and 13 injured. Initially 43 perished, but two more later succumbed to their injuries.
Possible causes.
A public inquiry by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the Ministry of Transport concluded that the "essential" cause remains unknown.
The accident was caused by the stoppage of the No.3 engine while the No.4 engine was also stopped. What caused the initial failure of the No.4 engine is unknown. The cause of the subsequent number 3 engine stoppage was either an electrical failure in the fuel cutoff actuator circuit or the accidental operation of the cutoff switch.
Memorials.
A 50th anniversary memorial service was held in the village of Brook, Isle of Wight on 18 November 2007 to commemorate the lives lost. In October 2008 a permanent memorial was dedicated at Brook's St Mary's Church, about 1 km (⅔ mi) due south of the crash site.

Robert Thomas Jenkins

Robert Thomas Jenkins CBE (31 August 1881 – 11 November 1969) was a Welsh historian and academic.
Life.
Jenkins was born on 31 August 1881 in Liverpool. He moved with his family to Bangor, Gwynedd when his father was appointed clerk to the registrar of the newly established University College of North Wales. However, both of his parents had died by 1888 and he was then brought up by his maternal grandparents in Bala, Gwynedd. He was baptised by Thomas Charles Edwards and studied at Bala grammar school before winning a scholarship to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, obtaining a first-class degree in English in 1901. He then studied history and English at Trinity College, Cambridge before teaching in Llandysul (1904), in Brecon (1904 to 1917) and at the City of Cardiff High School for Boys (1917 to 1930). Whilst he was a teacher, his interest in history deepened and he began to start writing articles on historical topics.
In 1928, he published a history of Wales in the 18th century, with further books following in 1930, the year that he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Wales Bangor. He was assistant editor, then joint editor, of "" and its English-language counterpart, "The Dictionary of Welsh Biography", writing over 600 entries. He was appointed to a professorship at Bangor in 1945 and retired from the university in 1948, although he continued to work.
He co-wrote a history of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion in 1951, the year of its 200th anniversary. He was awarded the CBE in 1956. He died on 11 November 1969.

Sam Hood

Samuel John Hood (20 August 1872 in Southern Australia - 8 June 1953) was an Australian photographer and photojournalist.
Career.
Early career.
Sam Hood's career began in the late 1880s. He ran a successful business in ships portraits (these negatives are now held by the Australian National Maritime Museum, Sydney) and portraits of people in the late nineteenth - early twentieth century.
What is most compelling is Sam Hood's adaptability to the changing nature of commercial photography. He opened his first studio in 1899 and the main source of income was generated from the main application of photography in the day - portraiture and weddings. Sam also supplemented this with income generated from selling finished and framed images of sailing vessels to the crews of vessels as they arrived in Sydney Harbour. He is reputed to have photographed every vessel that entered the Sydney harbor during a career that spanned 60 years (1890s-1950s).
Press photographer.
In 1918 he acquired the Dalny Studio at 124 Pitt Street, and began to expand his business into press photography, providing photographs for "The Sydney Mail", the Australasian, the Daily Guardian, the Daily Telegraph Pictorial, the "Labor Daily", the Sun, the Daily News and "The Sydney Morning Herald". Press photography increasingly came to dominate his business, and in 1934 he joined the "Labor Daily" for a short time as a full-time photographer, engaging other staff to look after his studio.
At the beginning of Sam's career photography in newspapers was a novelty and although the technology to reproduce half tone illustrations was in use by 1880 the Australian papers and in particular wood engravers whose job it was to illustrate articles resisted the new process. The Sydney Morning Herald did not reproduce a photograph until 1908. Sam Hood is acknowledged as a trailblazer in this genre - becoming adept at capturing the sensational, trivial and in particular sporting moments with his camera.
A number of photographers worked for Dalny Studio: some of these include Ernie Bowen, Gus Daley, Jack Lazern, Lethington Maitland as well as Sam's own children Gladys and Ted.
Commercial photographer.
By the mid-1930s most newspapers employed their own photographers, and Hood's commissions from the papers began to decline. Hood sought other kinds of commissions, and won a number of long term advertising and commercial contracts. He contributed a number of photographs of Sydney buildings and streets to Building, Construction and Australasian Engineer during the late 1930s and early 1940s. Hood also had extensive contacts in the entertainment industry, who called upon him to document celebrity events and stars, as well as theatre advertising. Throughout his career he worked at the stock-in-trade for commercial photographers: portraits, weddings and even funerals.
Collected work.
The State Library of NSW acquired a collection of negatives from Sam's daughter Gladys Hood in 1973 comprising some 30,000 images. Sam Hood's story is well documented in a volume produced by that institution and there are several images from that collection of Sam Hood with cameras and accessories included in this acquisition.

Reerh

Rerh/Reerh (Urdu=ر یڑھ) is a small village near Atter Shisha in the Union Council Sand-e-sar in Mansehra District in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. 
Geographical location.
This small village is in the North East of Mansehra city and in south to the New-Balakot. The village is located on Mansehra Kaghan Road/ N-15 National Highway, which connect Mansehra with Kaghan, Naran and Chilas. It is about 12 km from Mansehra on Naran Road. It is almost a four hour drive from the capital Islamabad. The village is one of the places inhabited by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake affectees from Balakot and other places.
Cultural diversity and natural beauty.
The village has a nice diversity of different ethnic groups i.e. Swati, Gujar, Sayyeds and Afghans. This diversity is also reflected in the languages spoken in the village viz. Hindko, Pashto and Urdu. An historical shrin, the "Sinjlian shrin" and historical ruins are located in the forest of the village. An old water mill is also located on the rain water stream. 
The village is in a small valley surrounded by the Himalayan mountains. One of the most famous peak of Pakistan Musa ka Musala is clearly visible from the village.
Health and education facilities.
After the earthquake, the village was one of the main focus to the rehabilitation facilites. A charity based eye-hospital was established by Layton Rahmatulla Benevolent Trust, which treat patients from all over the Mansehra. Similarly, a Model school was opened by the Muslim Hands organisation, called the Muslim Hands School of Excellence. The primary objective was to provide quality education to the orphans. Considering the quality of education in the school, many parents are interested to provide education to their children on charged basis. Very recently, a children hospital has also been established in the village. A government high school is also located in the village for girls and a primary school for boys, contributing to the litracy of its inhabitants.

River Cober

The River Cober () is a short river in west Cornwall, United Kingdom. It rises near Porkellis Moor in the former Kerrier District and runs to the west of the town of Helston before entering the largest natural lake in Cornwall – Loe Pool. The water is impounded by the natural barrier, Loe Bar, and the river system can be traced several kilometres out into Mount's Bay. Mining activity of over one hundred years in the river catchment, ceased in 1938, in the Wendron and Porkellis mining districts; and the engine house of Castle Wary (also known as Wheal Pool), near Nansloe can still be seen on the east side of the river below Helston. The lower reaches of river was canalised in 1946 and a causeway built over Loe Marsh in 1987. 
A common belief is that until the 13th century the River Cober ran directly to sea, until its mouth became blocked by a deposition of sand which formed Loe Bar and created Loe Pool. Loe Bar was most likely created by eustatic sea level rise after the last ice age. The rising sea level pushed a large amount of sediment into the mouth of the river, blocking it and creating a barrier beach. Loe Bar consists mainly of flint, a rock not found in Cornwall; the nearest onshore source is in east Devon, away. The most likely source of flint is found offshore; the drowned terraces of a former river that flowed between England and France and is now under the English Channel. Poorly forged hooks with mooring rings are on view on an ancient wall by St. Johns as well as remains of barges/boats having been observed under that road, indicating that boats were moored under the site of Castle Green car park.
The Helston branch railway (which closed in 1962) ran along part of the valley into Helston.

Construction surveying

Construction surveying (otherwise known as "lay-out" or "setting-out") is to stake out reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings. These markers are usually staked out according to a suitable coordinate system selected for the project.
Coordinate systems used in construction.
Land surveys and surveys of existing conditions are generally performed according to geodesic coordinates. However for the purposes of construction a more suitable coordinate system will often be used. During construction surveying, the surveyor will often have to convert from geodesic coordinates to the coordinate system used for that project.
Chainage or station.
In the case of roads or other linear infrastructure, a "chainage" (derived from Gunter's Chain - 1 chain is equal to 66 feet or 100 links) will be established, often to correspond with the center line of the road or pipeline. During construction, structures would then be located in terms of "chainage", "offset" and "elevation". "Offset" is said to be "left" or "right" relative to someone standing on the "chainage line" who is looking in the direction of increasing "chainage". Plans would often show "plan" views (viewed from above), "profile" views (a "transparent" section view collapsing all section views of the road parallel to the "chainage") or "cross-section" views (a "true" section view perpendicular to the "chainage"). In a "plan" view, "chainage" generally increases from left to right, or from the bottom to the top of the plan. "Profiles" are shown with the chainage increasing from left to right, and "cross-sections" are shown as if the viewer is looking in the direction of increasing "chainage" (so that the "left" "offset" is to the "left" and the "right" "offset" is to the "right"). 
"Chainage" may also be referred to as "Station".
Building grids.
In the case of buildings, an arbitrary system of grids is often established so as to correspond to the rows of columns and the major load-bearing walls of the building. The grids may be identified alphabetically in one direction, and numerically in the other direction (as in a road map). The grids are usually but not necessarily perpendicular, and are often but not necessarily evenly spaced. Floors and basement levels are also numbered. Structures, equipment or architectural details may be located in reference to the floor and the nearest intersection of the arbitrary axes.
Other coordinate systems.
In other types of construction projects, arbitrary "north-south" and "east-west" reference lines may be established, that do not necessarily correspond to true coordinates.
Equipment and techniques used in construction surveying.
Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have supplemented (and to a large extent supplanted) the traditional optical instruments.
The builder's level measures neither horizontal nor vertical angles. It simply combines a spirit level and telescope to allow the user to visually establish a line of sight along a level plane. When used together with a graduated staff it can be used to transfer elevations from one location to another. An alternative method to transfer elevation is to use water in a transparent hose as the level of the water in the hose at opposite ends will be at the same elevation. it is good
Equipment and techniques used in mining and tunneling.
Total stations are the primary survey instrument used in mining surveying.
Underground mining.
A total station is used to record the absolute location of the tunnel walls (stopes), ceilings (backs), and floors as the drifts of an underground mine are driven. The recorded data is then downloaded into a CAD program, and compared to the designed layout of the tunnel.
The survey party installs control stations at regular intervals. These are small steel plugs installed in pairs in holes drilled into walls or the back. For wall stations, two plugs are installed in opposite walls, forming a line perpendicular to the drift. For back stations, two plugs are installed in the back, forming a line parallel to the drift.
A set of plugs can be used to locate the total station set up in a drift or tunnel by processing measurements to the plugs by intersection and resection.
Professional status of construction surveyors.
Building Surveying emerged in the 1970s as a profession in the United Kingdom by a group of technically minded General Practice Surveyors. Building Surveying is a recognized profession within Britain and Australia. In Australia in particular, due to risk mitigation/limitation factors the employment of surveyors at all levels of the construction industry is widespread. There are still many countries where it is not widely recognized as a profession. The Services that Building Surveyors undertake are broad but include:
Building Surveyors also advise on many aspects of construction including:
Clients of a building surveyor can be the public sector, Local Authorities, Government Departments as well as private sector organisations and work closely with architects, planners, homeowners and tenants groups. Building Surveyors may also be called to act as an expert witness. It is usual for building surveyors to undertake an accredited degree qualification before undertaking structured training to become a member of a professional organisation. For Chartered Building Surveyors, these courses are accredited by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Other professional organisations that have building surveyor members include CIOB, ABE, HKIS and RICS.
With the enlargement of the European community, the profession of the Chartered Building Surveyor is becoming more widely known in other European states, particularly France. Chartered Building Surveyors, where many English speaking people buy second homes.
Distinction from land surveyors.
In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a distinct profession. Land surveyors have their own professional associations and licencing requirements. The services of a licenced land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicated the creation of new boundary lines and roads).

Five Little Indians

Five Little Indians (), (also known as FLI) was an alternative rock band based in Kolkata. The band was formed in January 2007. Five Little Indians merged melodic rock and a heavier sound with singer-songwriter sensibilities. The band used Hindustani classical vocals and often mixed ragas with a rock sound.
History.
Five Little Indians played its debut show at the Eastwind Festival '08. The band had formed only a few months before.
Back at Kolkata, the band was featured in "The Times of India" for its original sound. Simultaneously, FLI was the band in focus for August 2008 on IndianMusicRevolution.
The band played the Calcutta leg of the RSJ Pubrockfest '08, taking the stage after Aurora Jane to a full house at Someplace Else. The band played at Star Theatre, Calcutta as part of INTERface '08, an inter-disciplinary arts festival featuring artistes from Korea, Singapore, Switzerland and Japan.
In November 2008, FLI's original "Screaming At The Sun" saw a worldwide release as part of "Stupidditties 2", a compilation of Indian "un-metal" music from ennui.BOMB, supported by Counter Culture Records.
The November issue of "Rolling Stone" magazine, India, featured FLI's first single, "Happy Birthday" on its Downloads section, lauding the band's dark, moody sound and offering up a 3½ rating for the song.
In early 2009, FLI co-headlined the east zone finals of Campus Rock Idols with Skinny Alley in January. In May, the band, along with Bertie Da Silva and The Supersonics, organised the first chapter of Elektrik Kool Rock Revue, a platform for all-original music showcased in a series of shows.

Rossington railway station

Rossington was a railway station which served the village of Rossington on the Great Northern Railway's main line some south of Doncaster.It closed for regular passenger services in 1958 but was occasionally served by special trains until the mid-1960s.
History.
The station was set slightly west of the old village alongside the main road, from which access was gained, but on the building of the colliery village, known as New Rossington, to the west of the main line the station gained a whole new passenger base including miners travelling to work and home again, particularly before the colliery village was complete.
The station, with two flanking platforms, was set just south of the colliery junction.
Present day.
A new station at Rossington was suggested in a report to Doncaster Borough Council and with respect to this land was secured and reserved for the car park and approaches.
In September 2008 a report was submitted to Doncaster Borough Council on the strategy for prospective future rail corridors and stations in the area.

United Kingdom eSports Association

The United Kingdom eSports Association or UKeSA (pronounced "You-Kes-Sah") attempted to be a governing body of eSports in the United Kingdom and a member of the International eSports Federation (IeSF). The headquarters were in London, United Kingdom.
The UKeSA was responsible for governing amateur and professional eSports, building a structure with the government, industry and community in mind. These include Metropolitan Police Service, BBC, Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, Procter & Gamble, Future Publishing, Electronic Arts, Codemasters, The New World Assembly, XLEAGUE.TV, Team Dignitas, Reason Gaming, Team Infused, Fnatic, QuadV and Cadred. The association was launched on 31 October 2008 during the London Games Festival and was chaired by former XLEAGUE.TV channel head Ray Mia. He explained that UKeSA will essentially be the eSports equivalent of The Football Association, offering a centralised infustructure to UK eSports as well as support towards semi-professional and professional team and UK community led projects with the government.
UKeSA set up leagues and cup tournaments, split between three divisions: Open Division, Championship Division and Premiership Division. Each division represents the different levels of competition from amateur to professional and is played online via the internet through the means of a personal computer or a video games console. Teams can compete in a series of video games including "FIFA 09", "Call of Duty 4" and "Counter-Strike". Competition finals of these divisions were hosted at a specially selected venue in the United Kingdom. Teams are gathered to play against each other in off-line, local area network (LAN) setups as opposed to online play in the initial stages of the tournament.
History.
31 October 2008 sees the official launch of the United Kingdom eSports Association during the 2008 London Games Festival in London. The launch party was held at the Haymarket branch of the Sports Cafe. 
On the 26 November 2008, it has been announced that several of the following organisations, both private and public sector, have been involved in the setup of UKeSA: Metropolitan Police Service, BBC, Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, Procter & Gamble, Future Publishing, Electronic Arts, Codemasters, The New World Assembly, XLEAGUE.TV, Team Dignitas, Reason Gaming, Team Infused, Fnatic, QuadV and Cadred.
The Executive Committee of UKeSA were announced on 12 January 2009. Members consist of personnel from the likes of Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, British Broadcasting Association and Future Publishing.
£35,000 GBP prize fund was announced for the Championship and Premiership Divisions on 13 January 2009. A selection of video game titles were listed as part of the Open Division.
Future Publishing are partnering with UKeSA and aligning itself with the Open Division, announced on the 23 January 2009.
A selection of video game titles were announced for the Championship Division on the 27 January 2009. They were chosen from the amount of sign ups in the Open Division. Top four titles will be picked to represent the Premiership Division.
On 6 February 2009, UK Internet Service Provider, Be Unlimited has become the official broadband provider sponsor of UKeSA for 2009.
UKeSA has announced the selection of eSports teams to represent and play in the Premiership Division on the 13 February 2009. They include established teams such as Team Dignitas, The Imperial, Crack Clan and Team Coolermaster.

On the 2 April 2009, HMV and UKeSA have announced that they are pairing up to organise the "GameOn! London" exhibition at the Olympia Exhibition Centre, London, which takes place in June 2009.
The governing body signs up to become a member of the International eSports Federation.
In December 2009, amid controversy, the UKeSA signed for bankruptcy and has since made no attempt to pay back any individual or organisation it owed.
Committee Structure.
The UKeSA structure is made up of three key committees and a players union. Each committee plays a vital role in the operations of the eSports Association. So far, only the Executive Committee and the Community Council has been officially announced.
The Executive Committees purpose is to assist, direct and act as ambassadors for UK eSports to the wider public. The Committee shall be composed of prominent industry, media and government figures and shall include senior representatives from the games industry.
The Community Council consists of six people: Three elected members of the UK eSports community, two permanent Executive Committee members of the UKeSA and one Senior Operational Manager. Originally, the three elected members of the eSports community had to be Team Managers from Championship or Premiership Teams. This was changed to make the Community Council both representative and inclusive of the UK eSports community. However, candidates must be UK passport holders and they must reside in the United Kingdom.
Candidates put themselves up for electoral status and are given an opportunity to state their wishes as to why they should be chosen for the Community Council. Questions are then submitted to the candidates by the public and are then answered by writing or through a live debate broadcast on Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) or web-streaming.
Voting for potential Community Council members are done via public vote and are tallied via electronic means, such as a website. Voters are allowed to vote for 3 candidates and can only choose once per election. Elected members are not able to sit in the Community Council for two consecutive terms, however, they are able to be re-elected after standing down from a single term. No length of time has been give as to indicate how long these terms are.
Elected members of the committee are responsible for community related operational and disciplinary matters. These include the enforcement of game, tournament and cup regulations and rules, disciplinary breaches of regulations and conduct, allocation of the seasonal cash retainers, game type and rule suggestions and responsibility for video game specific sub-committees. Attendance is required for Community Committee members through bi-monthly conference calls and physical meetings by attending the General Assembly.
On the 18th March 2009, UKeSA have announced the results of the elections for the Community Council. The following will be sitting in as members of the Community Council for one term:
Also on the board for the Community Council is Ray Mia, who sits in as the permanent Executive Committee members of the Council and Peter Simpson as the Senior Operational Manager.
The Ethics Commission is charged with defining and updating a framework of ethical principles, including a Code of Ethics & Conduct, based upon the values and principles enshrined in the UKeSA Charter.
The Players Association is a separate entity that is supported by the UKeSA. This body, once established will be permanently represented on the Ethics Commission.
General Assembly.
Meetings are set up between the Executive Committee, Community Council, Ethics Commission, Players Association and other leading figures among the government, the eSports community (such as the International eSports Federation) and video games industry. Held three times a year, these meetings consist of debated issues concerning eSports in the United Kingdom, how they relate to operational aspects of UKeSA and the endorsement of the UKeSA Charter. The General Assembly is invitational only, with permanent membership endorsed by elective procedures.
Competition Structure.
Competitions are split into three divisions, some of which will comprise a league and a cup tournament. Each of the divisions represent the different levels, citing grassroots amateur level to the professional level. There are three seasons per year, which last approximately three months per season. Teams from each division can face promotions and relegation depending on how they perform in each of the leagues during the season. Throughout each of the seasons, a trophy cup tournament is held between teams of the Open and Championship Division. Competition finals of the Cup Tournament, Championship and Premiership divisions are hosted at a specially selected venue in the United Kingdom each season. Qualifying eSports teams are gathered to play against each other in offline, local area network (LAN) setups as oppose to online play in the initial stages of the tournament.
The Open Division represents the grassroots of eSports and form part of the amateur competitions. Playing restrictions are set to a minimum standard and games are played for fun or for practise. Because the Open Division is viewed as the amateur level of eSports, many teams that participate are generally those who have just started or want to determine whether they are suitable at competitive level before moving to the semi-professional side of eSports.
The Championship Division represents the semi-professional competition level. Teams that choose to play in this division are generally groups who wish to move to the next stage of eSports and play for financial gain. Many of these team are established and may have squads for each individual game/title. Teams can be promoted from this division into the Premiership Division, through participation. Support and training are given to teams to aid their development. Such training includes both management and business elements, which is seen as crucial to building a team into global brand.
The Premiership Division represents the professional level. Teams are given retainers to support themselves and develop their internal infrastructure as well as business support and training. Teams can be demoted through participation of competitions and must follow guidelines and rules throughout their participation.
A seasonal Cup Tournament is held between the teams of the Open Division and the Championship Division. Teams are required to pay to enter and games are then carried out online. The final remaining teams will face at an offline, local area network (LAN) event. Premiership Division teams are not allowed to enter.
Teams.
Currently, there are 13 selected eSports teams that represent the professional level of eSports. These teams participate in the UKeSA Premiership Division and play in different leagues that represent the video games they compete in. These teams are given media coverage through website editorials, terrestrial, satellite and cable television, internet protocol television and podcast. Business, management and financial support are given throughout the season, offering training managerial skills and business development, which will prepare the teams for sponsorships from companies like Dell, Adidas and other major business companies. Retainers are paid to Premiership teams at the end of each season, which will give financial support they need to carry on pushing the team brand as a primary business.
The number of Championship Division teams are determined by several factors such as paid entry fees and completion of team data like video game user identification tags, with teams submitting themselves for the competition each season. These teams are working towards being promoted into the UKeSA Premiership Division, which will offer the team the support they need to get their brand off the ground. Teams in the UKeSA Championship Division are given limited support for business and management training, while financial support comes from winning the competition.
Competitive Video Games.
There are a total of 17 video game titles currently used throughout the different divisions. They consist from a range of first person shooters, driving simulation, beat 'em ups, real-time strategy, sports simulation and rhythm action genres. Each of the video game titles have some element of competitive online and offline multiplayer modes, which allow the players to play against each other, specifically using competitive gaming rules set by UKeSA.
New video games titles are added when the eSports community requests for the inclusion in the competition. Titles are first placed into the Open Division to gauge the amount of sign-ups for that specific video game. If enough players register in the Open Division, UKeSA will move to include it into the semi-professional, Championship Division, where eSports athletes will be able to register to play for the prize fund. If a particular video game title is popular enough in the Championship Division, UKeSA will warrant that video game a place in the Premiership Division. 
Not all video game titles are suitable for use in a competitive environment as certain video game titles do not allow private sessions hosted by the players via peer-to-peer or server-led gaming rooms. Such games include UbiSoft's EndWar, where online play is restricted to its open Theatre of War lobby system.
Membership To The International eSport Federation.
The association was one of the members of the International eSport Federation (IeSF) alongside the following eSports associations:
Japan, Bulgaria and China were also looking to join the federation at the GStar 2008 exhibition held in South Korea.
Future developments.
UKeSA filed for bankruptcy whilst owing a large number of teams, players and industry related companies significant sums of money (http://www.cadred.org/News/Article/88207/)
Misconception.
UKeSA are not to be confused by the Electronic Sports Ltd's eSports competitions organized by Richard Millington and Morgan Olsson under the same name from 2002 to 2005.

The Man Between

The Man Between is a 1953 British thriller film directed by Carol Reed and starring James Mason, Claire Bloom, Hildegard Knef and Geoffrey Toone. A British woman on a visit to post-war Berlin is caught up in an espionage ring smuggling secrets into and out of the Eastern Bloc.
Plot.
Ivo Kern (James Mason) is a former lawyer who has participated in Nazi atrocities and is now selling his expertise to East Germans to kidnap and transport certain West Germans to the eastern bloc. Although Kern desires to relocate to the West, he is hampered by West German suspicions and his criminal past. Nevertheless, he agrees to a final kidnapping venture that fails, forcing his employer to take over and abduct Briton Susanne Mallison (Claire Bloom) by mistake. Kern had earlier feigned a romance with Mallison as a means to seize his kidnapping target.
The abduction of Mallison presents Kern with an opportunity to both return the unfortunate victim to the West and impress western authorities with his atonement. Despite Kern's selfish and dark facade, Mallison falls in love with him. She tells him that she can see humanity deep inside a man who had once wished to defend the innocent and the 'rights of man'. This glimpse also appears to a young East Berlin boy who assists Kern and Mallison in their attempt to escape, as he follows Kern everywhere and the boy is treated with kindness. Kern almost admits his affection for Mallison on one occasion but he directs the conversation back to his sordid past and the escape attempt. 
Ultimately, as Kern and Mallison are only a few feet from the Berlin gate while hidden in the back of a truck, their escape goes awry. Kern distracts the border guards as he runs from the vehicle, shouting at Mallison to hurry into the West. As her truck crosses the neutral zone and she reaches back for Kern, he is gunned down by the guards, and in doing so he gives his life to save hers.
Production.
The movie was filmed on location in Berlin and at the Shepperton Studios in England.
Reception.
James Mason won the best actor award from the National Board of Review.
Bosley Crowther of the New York Times wrote: "...It must be said, without reflection, that the credit for whatever there is in the way of exciting melodrama in this primarily atmospheric film goes to Mr. Reed for his direction of the actors and camera. For it is the attitudes of his people, the moods of the city in various scenes and the cleverness of the assembly, rather than the sharpness of the story told, that account for the modest distinction on the quality level of "The Man Between"."

<doc id="21606171" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21606171" title="Ashendon Junction">
Ashendon Junction

Ashendon Junction in Buckinghamshire, England, was a major mainline railway junction where, from July 1910, the Great Western Railway's (GWR) London-Birmingham direct route diverged from the Great Central Railway's (GCR) main London-Sheffield route.
The junction was where what is now the Chiltern Main Line (formerly the "Birmingham Direct Line" aka "Bicester cut-off" of the GWR), inaugurated in 1910, joined the post-1906 "Alternative Route" alignment of the GCR. It stood north-west of today's . It was a high-speed flying junction carrying southbound GWR trains from Birmingham on an embankment with a girder bridge over the top of northbound Great Central trains travelling from London Marylebone on to the 90 mph five-mile link to Grendon Underwood Junction, where they rejoined the original Great Central Main Line towards Brackley and beyond to the East Midlands and North.
Closure.
When the Great Central was closed south of Rugby in September 1966, the junction became redundant and the trackwork was later dismantled. The link to Grendon Underwood was already relatively little used by then, at least as far as passenger trains were concerned, most services from Marylebone towards Brackley and beyond using the original GC route through Aylesbury after long-distance expresses were ended in 1960.
Few signs of the old Great Central lines can now be seen from ground level on the site of the junction itself, but the trackbed is clearly visible from the air. Immediately north of the site, the Great Central trackbed towards Grendon Underwood is still intact. Little other evidence remains, except that over the best part of a mile the twin tracks of the Chiltern route still diverge at this point, a relic of the old layout preserved when Chiltern Railways redoubled the line between and Aynho Junction in 1998, it having been singled in the late 1960s.
Future.
Among various proposals for reopening parts of the GCML, one which would explicitly involve rebuilding Ashendon Junction is the scheme of Central Railway for a new intermodal freight line between the north of England and the Channel Tunnel.

<doc id="21606189" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21606189" title="National Physical Activity Guidelines">
National Physical Activity Guidelines

The National Physical Activity Guidelines are a set of guidelines set up by the Australian government due to the increase of obesity within the Australian Nation, and due to the increasing medical bills from obesity related diseases such as Heart Disease, Congestive Heart Failure, Strokes and other deadly diseases. The Australian Government has also put in many exercise related plans such as the Governor's 30 Day Family Challenge and the many fun runs.
Being Active.
The Australian Government has promoted being active for them to save money on hospitals so they can re-direct that into more important things like the current recession and re-building the destroyed homes and lives of the Black Saturday victims.
The 4 Guidelines.
The guidelines are directed at adults. (scroll lower for children's guide lines)
1." See movement as an opportunity, not an inconvenience "
2." Be active every day in as many ways as you can "
3."Put together at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity on most, preferably all days."
4."If you can, enjoy some regular vigorous activity for extra health and fitness"
The Types of Physical Activity.
"Occupational Activity" - This type of activity is sustained from all the exercise you get from work. This could include running/walking up and down stairs or if you're a labourer, all of the hard labour you undertake. This also includes schools for children.
"Active Transport" - This means that the activity you undertake instead of driving a car. You could walk, run, ride a bike or many other fun activities to get from point A to point B.
"Leisure Time Activity" - This includes all of the activity you do in your leisure time. It could be taking leisurely walks or doing sports such as football or soccer. It also include doing exercise to keep fit like running and going to the gym to work out.
"Household/Gardening Activity" - This consists of all the exercise you get from doing chores around the house and in the garden. i.e. mowing the lawn, vacuuming the house
NPAG Table.
Children (5-12) - At least 60 minutes (up to several hours is recommended) of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day, with focus on developing motor skills and having fun - No more than 2 hours per day surfing the net, watching TV or playing video games
Youth (12-18) - At least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day and no more than 2 hours using electronic media (unless educational)
Overweight and Obese - begin slowly working up to 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity being sure to not over do it to cause injury, then increased to 60–90 minutes to avoid weight gain
Older People - Should follow Adult guidelines - Strength and balance training also recommended
Diseases.
High blood pressure, hypertension - One-third of all cases of high blood pressure are associated with obesity. High blood pressure is twice as common in adults who are obese than in those who are at a healthy weight.
High blood cholesterol - 50% more likely to have elevated blood cholesterol levels.
Diabetes Type 2 - non-insulin dependent accounts for nearly 90% of all cases of diabetes. Researchers estimate that 88 to 97% of type 2 diabetes cases diagnosed in overweight people are a direct result of obesity
Congestive heart failure - obesity increases the risk of congestive heart failure, a potentially fatal condition in which the heart muscle weakens, progressively losing the ability to pump blood.
Heart disease - heart attack, congestive heart failure, sudden cardiac death, angina or chest pain, and abnormal heart rhythm is increased in persons who are overweight or obese.
Stroke - There is a link between obesity and stroke; this is particularly the case for people whose fat is situated predominantly in the abdominal region. Overweight people are more likely to have high blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure, but these associations are not the only explanations for the greater stroke rate.
Gallstones and gall bladder disorders
Gout - the condition may develop in people with obesity incidents are remarkably higher, Gout is strongly associated with obesity.
Osteoarthritis - Obesity may be a major factor in the development of osteoarthritis, particularly of the knee and especially in women.
Cancer -such as endometrial, breast, prostate, and colon
Complications of pregnancy
Poor female reproductive health - examples would be menstrual irregularities, infertility, irregular ovulation.
Bladder control problems - such as stress incontinence.
Psychological disorders -such as depression, eating disorders, distorted body image, and low self-esteem.

<doc id="21606223" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21606223" title="Ōjō">
Ōjō

The term Ōjō (往生) is a term in Japanese Buddhism for rebirth in the Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha. Sometimes the term is expressed as . The subject of how to obtain birth in the Pure Land remained an important question throughout Japanese Buddhist history even until today.
The Nara Schools.
The early Nara Buddhism schools provided different opinions as to how to obtain rebirth in the Pure Land, though in some cases, such as the Hossō school taught that icchantikas (people who committed the Five Grave Acts) could not obtain rebirth ever. Other schools taught that while accessible to all, the rituals involved were difficult, or that rebirth was not desirable.
Tendai and Shingon.
Early sects, particularly the Tendai and Shingon sects relied on esoteric texts, or interpretations of the Contemplation Sutra to develop rituals and visualizations of rebirth in the Pure Land. Genshin, a Tendai monk, wrote the "Ōjōyōshū" in which he described the horrors of Hell in Buddhism, and the delights of the Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha, then teaches the importance of reciting the nembutsu while maintaining a regimen of visualization and meditation practices.
For the Tendai sect in particular, the importance of rebirth in the Pure Land gained prominence among Saichō's later disciples, almost equal in importance to the central teaching of the Lotus Sutra.
Kamakura Buddhism.
As new, reform Buddhist sects arose in the Kamakura period, the importance of the concept of the Age of Dharma Decline gained prominence during this difficult period in history. It was during this time that independent schools of Jōdo and Jōdo Shinshū arose, with Hōnen teaching based on the Larger Sutra that rebirth could be obtained, even for icchantikas, solely by reciting Amitabha's name: the nembutsu. Hōnen's doctrine led to resistance among monks of the more traditional and state-sanctioned sects, leading to persecution or alternate teachings. One of Hōnen's sharpest critics, Myoe, taught another means of rebirth in the Pure Land through chanting of the Mantra of Light as a counter to Hōnen's doctrine.

Richard Mullock

Richard Mullock (3 May 1851 - 1920) was a Welsh sporting administrator and official, who is most notable for organising the first Welsh rugby union international game and was instrumental in the creation of the Welsh Football Union, which became the Welsh Rugby Union in 1934. Mullock came from an Anglo-Irish family; his family's firm in Wales, Henry Mullock & Son, was a printers based on Commercial Street in Newport, South Wales.
Early sporting ambitions.
Mullock had a history of connections with sports clubs around Newport and in 1874 became the secretary of the Newport Athletic Club. In 1879 the South Wales Football Club, which represented the interests of Welsh rugby union, attempted to organise a group of matches between a South Wales team and clubs representing Blackheath F.C., West of Scotland F.C., Oxford University and the South of Ireland. Mullock, wishing to improve the profile of his Newport club, secured a match against Blackheath before the S.W.F.C. could finalise any arrangements, stealing their fixture. Oxford University and West of Scotland lost interest in a match with either organisation, while a team from South of Ireland played a match against Newport on 18 November 1879, a day before the match with the S.W.F.U. By 1880 the S.W.F.U. was losing face as a governing body, with teams pulling out of matches after embarrassing fixture clashes and a lack of firm commitments.
The creation of a Welsh national team.
These events led to a meeting in the Tenby Hotel in Swansea in 1880, organised between rugby union clubs in an attempt to produce a representative team to face the English national team. Little was gained from the meeting, but it did produce an agreed desire form the parties present to meet with the English Rugby Football Union to arrange a match between Wales and England. Mullock became the architect of this movement and it was through him that the RFU arranged a fixture with a Welsh team on 8 January 1881. Mullock arranged a set of trials in December 1880 to choose the team that would face England, to be captained by Cambridge University player James Bevan.
The selection performance of the first Welsh team was contentious, with Mullock choosing a geographically varied team of educated men, most of whom most were linked to the older colleges. The original date of 8 January was postponed to 22 January, which in turn was cancelled due to frost. Mullock was concerned that the lack of a fixture date would lead towards the same accusations of incompetence levelled at the S.W.F.U., and accepted a date of 19 February even though it fell a day before a cup semi-final between Swansea and Llanelli. On the day of the match two of the players chosen to represent Wales failed to show for the game. The missing players later complained that there was little definite communication between Mullock and themselves.
The match itself was a one sided affair, with the English winning by seven goals, a dropped goal and six tries to nil, 82-0 by modern scoring standards. This was a terrible defeat for the Welsh and when the backlash came from the press, Mullock discovered that he was the only Welsh executive and was carrying the responsibility for the defeat. The "Western Mail" ran several editorials asking whether the match was an affiliated team endorsed by the S.W.F.U. or a private team organised by Mullock. The S.W.F.U. distanced themselves from the match, allowing the responsibility to fall on Mullock; though this tactic was ill conceived, as the rugby clubs appeared to prefer Mullock's positive approach rather than the S.W.F.U.'s inactivity. These events led to the formation of the Welsh Football Union, later to be named the Welsh Rugby Union, at the Castle Hotel in Neath on 12 March 1881. The S.W.F.U. failed to attend the meeting, which led to their dissolution as the WFU was accepted as the official representative union of the Welsh clubs.
Secretary of the Welsh Football Union.
The four major Welsh clubs, Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Llanelli were all in favour of the new direction Mullock was taking rugby in Wales and gave their support to the formation of the WFU. Swansea in particular were impressed with Mullock and commended him for his organisation of the Welsh team, despite the heavy defeat. At the meeting, with the support of Swansea, Mullock was installed as the first secretary of the Welsh Football Union, who in turn proposed Swansea's Cyril Chambers as president. By September 1882, Mullock was not only the WFU secretary and treasurer, but was installed as one of the four regional selectors for the Welsh national team, representing the Newport area.
Mullock, although enthusiastic as a sporting organiser was a poor accountant, and a bad choice for treasurer. At the end of the 1882-3 season, the Union had received roughly £96 in receipts, but had had spent over £215, roughly a quarter of this amount spent on hotel bills attempting to impress RFU delegates. It was Mullock's poor fiscal abilities that would later remove him from his posts within the WFU. In 1891 at Llanelli's AGM, the club secretary, Gavin Henry, stated that after the 1891 Home Nations match at Stradey Park, where Wales faced Ireland, Mullock had taken the gate receipts without paying Llanelli's costs. Henry wrote several letters to Mullock but did not receive a response, resulting in Henry meeting the costs himself. Henry called for Mullock to be 'deposed' from his position within the WFU. 
At the 1890-1 WFU annual meeting, Swansea's William Gwynn, challenged Mullock's position and demanded that he step down on the grounds of financial mismanagement. While Tom Williams of Neath complained that Mullock, as treasurer, had not provided a balance sheet for members since 1884. Gwynn called for Mullock to be replaced as Secretary by Walter E. Rees; but Rees withdrew after W.D. Phillips and Horace Lyne argued Mullock's case, reminding the members how Mullock financed the Union in its early years. Mullock retained his position as Secretary but stood down as Treasurer in favour of William Wilkins.
The next season saw the end of Mullock as WFU Secretary; when an incident involving a Swansea player in a game at Exeter, resulted in a request by the RFU for the player concerned to write a letter of apology. Many WFU members felt that Mullock had grovelled towards the RFU during the affair and in September 1892, Mullock was no longer Secretary.
As rugby referee.
Mullock also officiated for rugby union matches, and was umpire in several international matches, including the 1884 Home Nations Championship clash between Scotland and Wales. His opposite partner on the line at the same game was JA Gardener, secretary of the Scottish Rugby Union and the referee was James MacLaren, President of the RFU.
In 1886 as part of the Home Nations Championship, Mullock was selected to referee an international game between England and Ireland. This followed on from the previous year when Horace Lyne had refereed the same fixture between the nations. England won both matches by a try, and the fact that two members of the WFU were seen to have 'had a hand' in Irish defeats caused an already strained relationship between Wales and Ireland to worsen. In both the 1885 and 1886 Championships, Ireland refused to play Wales.
Personal history.
Mullock was born in 1851 in Newport, South Wales to Henry Mullock and Henrietta Oliver. The family ran a printing company and published the local paper, "The Newport Advertiser". Mullock was one of at least four siblings, including younger brother William and sisters Julia and Helen. Mullock married and had six children, though apart from a daughter, Dorothy, there is little information on his family.
In 1893 the affairs off Mullock became public as he strived to fight off bankruptcy orders, with the local courts deeming him £2,000 in debt. In 1902, Mullock was declared bankrupt and emigrated that year to Africa. He died in 1920.

Yugoslavia and the Allies

In 1941 when the Axis invaded Yugoslavia, King Peter II formed a Government in exile in London, and in January 1942 the royalist Draža Mihailović became the Minister of War with British backing. But by June or July 1943, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had decided to withdraw support from Mihailović and the Chetniks he led, and support the Partisans headed by Josip Broz Tito. The main reason for the change was not the reports by Fitzroy Maclean or William Deakin, or as later alleged the influence of James Klugmann in Special Operations Executive (SOE) headquarters in Cairo or even Randolph Churchill, but the evidence of Ultra decrypts from the Government Code and Cipher School in Bletchley Park that Tito's Partisans were a ""much more effective and reliable ally in the war against Germany"". Nor was it due to claims that the Chetniks were collaborating with the enemy, though there was some evidence from decrypts of collaboration with Italian and sometimes German forces.
Contact with Yugoslavia.
Limited resources meant that in 1942 support for the Chetniks was limited to "words rather than deeds". The SOE, charged with fostering resistance movements, initially sent Captain D. T. Hudson to contact all resistance groups in September 1941. Hudson's reports on the meetings between Mihailović and Tito (and their staffs) were not encouraging, and he sent warnings that the communist Partisans suspected that Mihailović was collaborating with the government of Milan Nedić in Serbia. Contacts with both groups were severed by the first Axis winter offensive, but decrypts of German signals showed that the Chetniks were collaborating with the Italians. This collaboration was based on an old friendship of Serbs and Italians in Dalmatia going back to the times of the Austrian rule.
In June 1942 a report by Major General Francis Davidson, Director of Military Intelligence to Churchill, described the Partisans as "extreme elements and brigands". British Military Intelligence wanted to maintain support for Mihailović at the time that they were watching the progress of the German Operation Weiss against the Partisans, though they started having doubts by March 1943. Colonel Bateman in the Directorate of Military Operations also recommended supporting the "active and vigorous Partisans" rather than the "dormant and sluggish Chetniks."
An assessment by Major David Talbot Rice of MI3b in September 1943 confirmed that there had only been isolated anti-German activity by Mihailović and ""the heroes of the hour are undoubtedly the Partisans"". He recommended that Mihailović should be told to destroy German lines of communication in Serbia, otherwise Tito would be the sole recipient of British aid which they were at long last in a position to deliver. The Signals intelligence had completely changed the view of Talbot Rice and MI3b in six months.
When Mihailović was perceived as less effective than the communist Partisans, missions were sent to the Partisans. One of the first of these missions, codenamed "Fungus", was dropped "blind" in the area of Dreznica and Brinje, north west of Senj on the Croatian Adriatic coast, on the night of April 20/21 1943 by a B24 Liberator of No. 148 Squadron RAF, operating from Derna The mission consisted of two Canadian emigrees (Petar Erdeljac and Pavle Pavlic), and Corporal Alexander Simic (Simitch Stevens) of the Royal Pioneer Corps. They were found by the partizans and taken to the Croatian Partizan HQ at Sisane Polje, where Erdeljac and Pavlic were recognized by Ivan Rukovina, the Commander of the Croatian HQ, who had fought with them in the International Brigades in Spain. Alexander Simic was interrogated at length by Dr Vladimir Bakaric, the Political Commissaar (who subsequently became President of Croatia) before being allowed to establish radio contact with SOE headquarters in Cairo and arrange the subsequent missions of Major William Jones to join Simic at the Croatian HQ and that of Captain Bill Deakin to Tito's Headquarters in May 1943.
He was joined the following September by Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean, an SAS officer and also a Conservative Member of Parliament and former diplomat, with good language skills. Maclean subsequently sent a "blockbuster report" to Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, recommending that Britain should transfer support to Tito and sever links with Mihailović. In 1943 the SOE in England and the Foreign Office wanted to continue support for Mihailović, although as these organisations had only limited access to decrypts they were not so well-informed on the situation there. The SOE headquarters in Cairo (which was frequently at odds with the London headquarters), MI6, the Directorates of Military Intelligence and Operations, the Chiefs of Staff and ultimately Churchill himself, wanted to switch support to Tito.
Churchill's sources.
Churchill's main source was the intelligence decrypts from Bletchley Park which he saw "raw", as well as intelligence reports and digests. After receiving a signals intelligence digest in July 1943 he wrote that ""it gave a full account of the marvellous resistance by the followers of Tito and the powerful cold-blooded manoeuvres of Mihailović in Serbia."" Churchill announced his decision to support Tito to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin (much to his surprise) at the Tehran Conference in November 1943, and publicly in an address to Parliament on 22 February 1944. This address referred to reports from Deakin and Maclean for justification, as the Ultra decryptions from Bletchley Park were secret even after the war
Fitzroy Maclean discussed Yugoslavia with Churchill in Cairo after the Tehran Conference. Churchill said that as neither of them intended to live there after the war: ""… the less you and I worry about the form of Government they set up, the better. That is for them to decide. What interests us is, which of them is doing most harm to the Germans."" Maclean had already reported that ""...the Partisans, whether we helped them or not, would be the decisive political factor in Jugoslavia after the war and, secondly that Tito and the other leaders of the movement were openly and avowedly Communist and that the system which they would establish would inevitably be on Soviet lines and, in all probability, strongly oriented towards the Soviet Union."" However, Maclean had also noticed Tito's "independence of mind" and wondered whether Tito might evolve into something more than a Soviet puppet.)
While in England in the spring of 1944, Maclean discussed Yugoslavia with some of the British officers who had been attached to General Mihailović's Headquarters. One of the meetings was at Chequers and was presided over by Churchill himself. ""It was common ground that the Cetniks, though in the main well disposed towards Great Britain, were militarily less effective with the communist Partisans and that some of Mihailović’s subordinates had undoubtedly reached accommodation with the enemy."" And some who knew him best ""while liking and respecting him as a man, had little opinion of Mihailović as a leader"", though the Cetnik detachments in Serbia at least could be a significant force with ""new and more determined leadership and with better discipline."" Maclean was also asked to Buckingham Palace to brief King George VI on the Jugoslav situation. He found him as well-informed on the situation as anyone else he had met back in England, and said he ""took an entirely realistic view of it.""
British Intelligence sources.
Most of the Signals intelligence obtained by Bletchley Park on the Balkans was initially from Luftwaffe morse code traffic encoded by Enigma; initially the general Luftwaffe Red key, then various German Army keys. They also decrypted various teleprinter links for high-level traffic: "Fish" (Vienna-Athens) then "Codfish" (Straussberg-Salonika), plus medium and low grade hand cyphers. Abwehr, Sicherheitsdienst and railway communications were intercepted and decrypted, providing evidence of resistance activities. For German policy on Yugoslavia, communications to Tokyo from the Japanese Ambassador, General Oshima Hiroshi, were also useful. With the primitive communications infrastructure and the disruption of land communications, the German forces in Yugoslavia relied heavily on radio communications which, unknown to themselves was insecure, so that a 1945 comment was that ""never in the field of Signals intelligence has so much been decrypted about so little.""
While the volume of messages was not great, Bletchley Park also intercepted messages from Tito and from the separate Slovene Communist Party to Georgi Dimitrov, the Secretary-General of the Comintern in Moscow. These messages to Dimitrov continued even after the Comintern was officially dissolved in June 1943.
The volume of Enigma decrypts from the Soviet Fronts and the Balkans declined substantially from the summer of 1944, but this was more than offset for the Soviet Fronts by success with "Fish" links.
Discovery of collaboration.
During Operation Weiss against the Partisans in 1943, the Italian forces used Italian-officered Chetnik units against the communist Partisans despite German objections. Consequently, the German Operation Schwartz against the Chetniks and Partisans was kept secret from the Italians. Pavle Djurisić, one of Mihailović’s principal commanders, fell out with Mihailović as he wished to join the Germans against the Partisans, which Mihailović refused to contemplate. Both Axis operations were followed by Bletchley Park in decrypts from the Abwehr (German military intelligence). A decrypted report from General Alexander Löhr, the commander in chief of the German Army Group E in the Balkans, reported on 22 June that 583 German soldiers and 7,489 Partisans had been killed, with the probability that the Partisans had lost another 4,000 men. Chetnik losses were put at 17, with nearly 4,000 taken prisoner. The contrast between the two resistance movements was stark. However, the decrypts, ""far from providing evidence of Cetnik-German collaboration, continued to leave no doubt that at least at the highest level the Germans remained set on Mihailović's destruction. In July Hitler had suggested that the C-in-C South East "[Löhr]" should put a higher price on the heads of Mihailović and Tito.""
The most significant report of Chetnik collaboration was the text of a treaty between Lukačević, one of Mihailović’s principal commanders, and the German Commander South East in September and October 1943, In the treaty, which was copied to Churchill, Lukačević agreed to a cessation of hostilities in his area of southern Serbia and joint action against the communist Partisans.
British mission.
Deakin's mission to the Partisans was called "Operation Typical", and it represented the British General Headquarters in the Middle East. The first parachuted supplies dropped to the Partisans had a very marked propaganda effect despite some bizarre episodes, e.g. a planeload of Atrobin for treating malaria, and a supply of badly needed boots, but all for the left foot. In May 1943, a signal from Cairo ordered that medical supplies, which had been loaded onto a Handley Page Halifax at Derna were to be left behind, as their despatch would infringe British obligations to the Royal Yugoslav government. The plane's crew complied, but loaded all the military items, e.g., boots, clothing, guns and ammunition, that they could loot at the airfield onto the aircraft.
Deakin had urged American representation on the mission, and on 21 August 1943 Captain Melvin O. (Benny) Benson of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) arrived, remaining in Yugoslavia for four months. Benson noted in his report ""the giving of credit to the Cetniks for Partisan victories and otherwise referring to them as Patriots, in an attempt to include the Cetniks with the Partisans."" The crediting of Partisan attacks to Chetniks was also being reported on the BBC. Captain Benson was later replaced by Major Linn (Slim) Farish 
The sending of the Maclean mission on 17 September 1943 placed the relations between Tito and the British on a more formal and senior level. Fitzroy Maclean was the personal representative of the Prime Minister, and his arrival marked implicitly the "de facto" recognition of the Yugoslav National Liberation Army, as the Partisans were formally known.
Maclean wondered whether officials in Cairo ""quite realised the difficulties of travel in German-occupied Europe"", when he was told in an official signal that he was to go to Cairo immediately but that the Partisan delegation could follow later if required... (it turned out that the British delegation was returning from the conference at Teheran via Cairo). While away down the coast Maclean was amazed to receive a garbled message from Cairo, with a clear sentence ""King now in Cairo, Will be dropped to you at first opportunity."" He thought that as part of London's gradual rapprochement policy between King Peter of Yugoslavia and the Partisans, the King was to be ""dropped headlong into the seething centre of the Jugoslav cauldron."" Later he was told that the message referred to their new signals officer, whose surname was King.
When the Italians surrendered the mission received a signal from the British General Headquarters in the Mediterranean regarding the Italian forces, which assumed that ""the British mission attached to Tito’s headquarters was in some queer fashion in operational command of operational ‘guerrilla’ units."" Similar orders were sent to Colonel Bailey at Mihailović’s headquarters and to the commanders of British missions in Greece and Albania, and the episode revealed ""the extent to which our mission had not succeeded in conveying to our superiors the reality of the situation in Partisan-held territory.""
Switching support to the Partisans.
The change in Allied support in Yugoslavia from the Chetniks to the Partisans in 1943 was because they were a more effective ally. The public justification at the time was the reports from Maclean and Deakin; the real source was the signals intelligence decrypts, but they were secret at the time and remained so until the 1970s when the work of Bletchley Park was made public. The change was driven by Churchill and (British) Army Intelligence, but was not due to any supposed influence from Randolph Churchill or James Klugman.
Churchill's son Randolph was on one of the missions to Yugoslavia. Evelyn Waugh accompanied Randolph Churchill, and Waugh put in a report about Tito's persecution of the clergy, which was "buried" by Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. No evidence is given for the suggestion made in the article on Draža Mihailović that Randolph Churchill privately influenced his father to support Tito, and in any case he was recruited by Maclean for his mission after the Teheran Conference, when the decision to support Tito had already been made.
James Klugmann was a Communist and was undoubtedly a KGB agent and linked to the Cambridge Five. He joined the Yugoslav section of SOE Cairo in 1942, where he advocated and lobbied for Tito. But it was stated that ""Whatever lobbying may have been taking place in Cairo, it would have been the overwhelming evidence of the Bletchley Park decrypts, Churchill's favoured source of intelligence, which persuaded Britain's wartime leader that Tito and his Partisans were a much more effective, and reliable, ally in the war against Germany.""
Captain Bill Deakin, who led the first military mission in 1943 and was caught up in the Battle of the Sutjeska (hence the title of his book) had been Churchill’s researcher and librarian in the thirties.
Allied bombings.
The United States Army Air Force (USAAF) and Royal Air Force (RAF) bombed many Yugoslav cities and towns during the Axis occupation. These attacks included intensive air support for Partisan operations in May–June 1944, and a bombing campaign against transport infrastructure in September 1944 as the "Wehrmacht" retreated from the Balkans. This latter operation was known as Operation Ratweek.
Aftermath.
When George Musulin organized the 1944 final rescue of 500 American airmen called Operation Halyard, Draža Mihailović sent a political mission to Bari, Italy aboard an American plane. The arrival of Pribićević (now former President of the Independent Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), Dr. Vladimir Belajčić (former Justice of the Superior Court of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), Ivan Kovač (a Chetnik representative), and Major Zvonko Vučković (one of the principal Chetnik commanders) caused the British concern since they had already chosen who to back. At the Bari stopover, Ivan Šubašić, who signed the Treaty of Vis, also known as the Tito-Šubašić Agreement, earlier that year, met with the members of Mihailović's political mission but the Prime Minister-in-exile said nothing about the agreement he signed months earlier compromising the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Pribićević and his team remained in the West after the war ended, like thousands of other soldiers who managed to escape.

Whiplash (1948 film)

Whiplash is a 1948 American film noir directed by Lewis Seiler and written by Kenneth Earl, Harriet Frank, Jr., Maurice Geraghty and Gordon Kahn. The film features Dane Clark, Alexis Smith, Zachary Scott and Eve Arden.
Plot.
A struggling painter, Mike Gordon, is unhappy that cafe owner Sam has let a customer, Laurie Durant, purchase one of his works. Mike considers his art worthless and goes to Laurie offering to buy it back. She insists on keeping it, so Mike invites her to dinner instead.
Mike falls for Laurie after a romantic night, then is caught off guard when she leaves town without a word. He learns that the painting was mailed to a Dr. Arnold Vincent, but can't get the doctor to explain why.
A woman he knows, Chris Sherwood, insists on Mike accompanying her to a nightclub. There, to his astonishment, Laurie is the featured singer. The club is owned by Rex Durant, a crippled ex-boxer, and Laurie is his wife.
Durant's looking for a new fighter to train. He likes the way Mike handles himself when a scuffle occurs. At the gym, it turns out Dr. Vincent works for Durant and is Laurie's brother as well. Durant has a hold on Vincent, blaming him for a botched operation that left him in a wheelchair for life. Laurie only stays with Durant so he won't sue her brother for malpractice.
Adopting the name "Mike Angelo" as a nod to his interest in art, Mike becomes a prizefighter. But he suffers a concussion in a personal disagreement with Costello, one of Durant's tough goons. Durant forces him to proceed with a scheduled bout, having discovered the painting and learning Laurie is in love with Mike.
Mike is beaten badly in the ring. He manages to rally and win, but collapses and requires brain surgery. Vincent is murdered by Costello, but when Durant's wheelchair rolls away into oncoming traffic, he is struck by a car and killed. Mike recovers and leaves boxing forever, Laurie by his side.
Reception.
Critical response.
"The New York Times" film critic, Thomas M. Pryor, panned the film. He wrote, "Good sense and dramatic construction went by the wayside in the filming of "Whiplash" and what is left on the screen is a pointless exposition of brutality, nicely demonstrated, however, by Mr. Clark and Zachary Scott, with Miss Smith providing suitable decoration. If it's plain, old fashioned mayhem that you desire, "Whiplash" most likely will be to your liking. Otherwise proceed with caution."

In 1955, Neale was knighted, and on 17 November 1958 he delivered a lecture in Washington, D.C. commemorating Elizabeth I's accession to the English throne four hundred years previously. From 1956, Neale was Professor Emeritus, but continued to do some academic teaching at University College London.
He died in 1975 and was buried in Harrogate Cemetery. He had married Elfreda Skelton of Harrogate whom he had a daughter Stella.
Historical views.
Neale is viewed (along with A. F. Pollard) as a traditionalist historian, whose views have been subsequently undermined by later generations of revisionist historians (for example Norman L. Jones). He is well known for his thesis on the Elizabethan Puritan Choir, in which he claimed that a group of Puritan MPs successfully managed to force Elizabeth I's hand on many policy issues throughout her reign, including at the start. Neale also saw the roots of the English Civil War in what he perceived to be the obstructive and rebellious nature of Elizabeth I's Parliaments, a view questioned by later historians. Neale is also recognised for his work in bringing to light new sources on Tudor England, and developing different ways of studying the period.

Quantity calculus

Quantity calculus is the formal method for describing the mathematical relations between "abstract" physical quantities. (Here the term "calculus" should be understood in its broader sense of "a system of computation," rather than in the sense of differential and integral calculus.) Its roots can be traced to Fourier's concept of dimensional analysis (1822). The basic axiom of quantity calculus is Maxwell's description of a physical quantity as the product of a "numerical value" and a "reference quantity" (i.e. a "unit quantity" or a "unit of measurement"). De Boer summarized the multiplication, division, addition, association and commutation rules of quantity calculus and proposed that a full axiomatization has yet to be completed. 
Measurements are expressed as products of a numeric value with a unit symbol, e.g. "12.7 m". Unlike algebra, the unit symbol represents a measurable quantity such as a meter, not an algebraic variable.
A careful distinction needs to be made between abstract quantities and measurable quantities. The multiplication and division rules of quantity calculus are applied to SI base units (which are measurable quantities) to define SI derived units, including dimensionless derived units, such as the radian (rad) and steradian (sr) which are useful for clarity, although they are both algebraically equal to 1. Thus there is some disagreement about whether it is meaningful to multiply or divide units. Emerson suggests that if the units of a quantity are algebraically simplified, they then are no longer units of that quantity. Johansson proposes that there are logical flaws in the application of quantity calculus, and that the so-called dimensionless quantities should be understood as "unitless quantities".
How to use quantity calculus for unit conversion and keeping tack of units in algebraic manipulations is explained in the handbook on Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry.

<doc id="21606334" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21606334" title="BrainSurge">
BrainSurge

BrainSurge is an American children's game show aired on Nickelodeon hosted by Jeff Sutphen. The show taped its first season in February 2009, and debuted on September 28, 2009. The show's format was adapted from the Tokyo Broadcasting System game show "Brain Survivor".
The network announced on February 18, 2010 that the program was renewed for a second season, that will consist of 40 episodes, and will feature the same format without any known changes. The second season, which featured the 40 original episodes plus one episode held over from season one, premiered on June 21, 2010. The third season started airing on July 18, 2011 on Nick at Nite, marketed as Family BrainSurge, and had a two-person family team format with five teams. The third season ran until November 17, 2011, when the show was cancelled. The remaining episodes aired on Nicktoons from April 28-May 9, 2014.
"BrainSurge" was taped at Hollywood Center Studios in Hollywood, California.
The series premiered on Discovery Kids in Latin America and Brazil on November 7, 2011, the Spanish show title is "Veloz Mente". No channel in Canada has aired the series.
Format.
"BrainSurge"'s challenges are designed to test the memory and comprehension skills of its contestants.
Level One: Brain Tease.
The contestants/teams begin by playing a series of visual puzzles. There were six(sometimes 5) puzzles in season 1, worth 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 points each (for a maximum of 250 points); in season 2, the 40-point puzzle was dropped(except in an episode that was delayed from season 1); in season 3 ("Family BrainSurge"), there are four puzzles, worth 10, 25, 50, and 100 points. Each solution is a number that the players need to enter using their keypads. The contestants/teams have 10 seconds to lock in their answers. The four highest-scoring contestants/teams advance to the next round (ties are broken by how quickly the contestants/teams entered their answers; if the teams tied for last place had a score of 0 points in season 3, a tiebreaker puzzle is played instead and the team who correctly answers it the fastest will advance); all eliminated contestants/teams in this and future levels are sent down the "Brain Drain", a slide formed as a human ear containing "ear wax" foam.
Level Two: Brain Fart.
During the second round, the four remaining contestants/teams are told a story from a book read by the host and are asked questions in turn about the story. Contestants/teams lock in their answers by sitting down on a chair. If a contestant/team gets a question wrong, the chair makes a farting noise, and the contestant/team is pulled backwards through a paper "tooth" of a large face (made to resemble host Sutphen) and eliminated from further play. This continues until two contestants/teams remain. In "Family BrainSurge", each team is allowed one "Brain Fart," which allows two other members of the family (the "Brain Trust") to offer an answer for the team; the team stays in the game or is eliminated based on that answer. There were two types of questions used in Level 2. One type involved who, what, where when and why type questions about events in the story(in this type, if a question is missed the next player/team will be asked the same question) and the other type involved players/teams naming things that Jeff listed in the story(e.g. name the musical instruments mentioned in the story) and in this type repeating an already said answer, including another form of that answer, counted as a wrong answer. On "Family BrainSurge", if all the answers in the naming type questions are used up before 2 team are eliminated, then Jeff will ask tiebreaker questions using who, what, where type questions, and teams cannot use their brain farts during a tiebreaker(any unused brain farts are out of play when the tiebreaker starts).
Knockout Round.
In the Knockout round, the two remaining contestants/teams have ten seconds to memorize a grid of 16 numbers containing 8 pairs of images from the story. The contestants/teams then take turns matching pairs of images from the story. Once either contestant makes a mistake, the player who makes the next match wins the game in a sudden-death match. At this point, the contestant/team that lost in this round and the 2 eliminated contestants/teams from Level 2 all go down the Brain Drain.
Level Three: Brain Trip (The Final Stage).
For the bonus round, the contestant must successfully trace out three paths on grids within 90 seconds. The first path is six squares(5 squares on a season 1 episode) on a 4x4 grid, the second is eight squares(10 squares on two season 1 episodes and 9 squares on a season 2 episode) on a 5x5 grid, and the third is ten squares on a 6x6 grid; squares are always connected (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Each square has an actuator in the middle that must be stepped on to activate the square. Contestants see each path twice; the clock starts running when the contestant first activates a square. After completing a path successfully, the contestant must step on an actuator outside the board to stop the clock. Contestants are told immediately when they make a mistake; they must return to the start and view the pattern again before being allowed to continue; when viewing the pattern after a mistake, the clock continues to run. Contestants can win three prizes, one for completing each of the three paths with the grand prize being a trip(on a celebrity episode of Family BrainSurge, it was a billiards table); any prizes they win on one stage are safe no matter what happens later. Contestants who fail to complete all three boards must go down the Brain Drain, while contestants who succeed are slimed in network tradition. Also, on Family BrainSurge, the episode's winning team just for making it to the bonus round will also get a donation made by the show's staff in their name to one on Nickelodeon's Big Help partners.
It should be noted that most players/teams who have cleared the 1st 2 grids on the 1st try won the grand prize. There were 3 players who have cleared all 3 grids on the 1st try, including True Jackson VP star Matt Shivley, who was not only the 1st of the 3, but also set the fastest bonus round win by accomplishing this rare feat.
Specials.
Girls vs. Boys.
During the first week of the second season, the audience was divided into two sections, each with a group of a different gender. In each episode, male contestants wore green and female contestants wore purple. If a male contestant won, male audience members received a green BrainSurge t-shirt. If a female contestant won, female audience members received a purple t-shirt.
Celebrity Episodes.
Each season has at least 2 episodes featuring celebrity players(at least one episode each season has Nickelodeon stars as players). On the season 1 and 2 celebrity episodes, the Nick stars played and the winner played to win prizes and the sliming for a lucky audience member. The season 2 Nick star episodes featured the stars representing their show in teams(either 3 teams of 2 or 2 teams of 3) even though each player wore a different color. Losing the bonus round meant that the celebrity had to go down the Brain Drain(in season 1, the audience member also went down the brain with the celebrity). On Family BrainSurge, The Nick stars won prizes for their Brain Trusts in the audience(fans of the show each team was representing). There were also two Family BrainSurge episodes with celebrities and their families playing to win prizes for themselves and a donation to the charity of their choice, as well as an episode with teams consisting of a child paired up with a WWE star(the WWE stars wore whatever they wanted rather than the BrainSurge shirts usually worn on the show).
Co-Host Week.
One week during season 2 featured Jeff hosting with a celebrity co-host by his side. The round one puzzles and the round two story usually contained references to that episodes co-host(mainly about what they're famous for). Also, during those episodes, if the player lost the final round, the co-host would go down the Brain Drain with the player. Likewise if the player win the final round, the co-host would get slimed with the player.
Family Week.
During the last week of season 2, There were pairs of related players competing, but the game still played with the usual rules. Related players wore the same color shirt. Two episodes had 3 pairs of siblings playing individually. Another 2 episodes had the same thing but with 3 pairs of twins specifically. On the sibling and twins episodes, the winners sibling or twin would wish them luck vie video before starting the bonus round. One episode that week had 6 parent child teams playing(which might have inspired Family BrainSurge) and during the bonus round, the child did the 4x4 and the 6x6, while the parent did the 5x5.

Botany Bay (film)

Botany Bay is a 1953 American drama film directed by John Farrow and starring Alan Ladd, James Mason and Patricia Medina. It was based on a novel of the same name by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall.
Plot.
In 1787 prisoners are shipped from Newgate Jail on the "Charlotte" to found a new penal colony in Botany Bay, New South Wales. Amongst them is Hugh Tallant (Ladd) an American medical student who had been wrongly imprisoned. During the journey he begins to clash with the villainous Captain Gilbert (Mason), and is soon plotting a full-scale mutiny against him.
Production.
There was film interest in the book even before its publication because of the success of "Mutiny on the Bounty", also from a novel by Nordhoff and Hall. The film rights were sold in 1940 for a reported $50,000.
In 1941 Joel McCrea expressed interest in playing the lead. The film was originally planned to be made in 1946, starring Ray Milland with location shooting in Australia. However these plans were delayed when Paramount became concerned about the cost.
Four koalas and two kangaroos were flown from Australia to appear in the film. The koalas were the first to be exported from Australia in 25 years and were later transferred to San Diego Zoo.
The only Australian born members of the cast were Murray Matheson and Brendan Toomey. Aboriginal characters were played by African-American actors. (Peter Pagan was reported as going to feature in the film but this did not seem to eventuate.)
Historical Basis.
There was a real ship called the "Charlotte" which sailed with the First Fleet under a Captain Gilbert.

Birkin's Bend (previously Orrisdale South or Rhencullen) is situated between the 15th Milestone and 16th Milestone road-side markers on the Snaefell Mountain Course between Kirk Michael Village and Bishopscourt on the primary A3 Castletown to Ramsey Road and the road junction with the tertiary C19 Orrisdale Road in the parish of Michael in the Isle of Man.
This series of bends was part of the Highland Course and Four Inch Course used for the Gordon Bennett Trial and Tourist Trophy automobile car races held in the Isle of Man between 1904 and 1922. Also, Birkin's Bend is part of the Snaefell Mountain Course used since 1911 for the Isle of Man TT and from 1923 for the Manx Grand Prix Races.
During an early morning practice session for the 1927 Isle of Man TT, Archie Birkin brother of Tim Birkin, one of the "Bentley Boys" of the 1920s, swerved to avoid a fish-van travelling to Peel and crashed fatality. The corner at Rhencullen on the A3 primary road where the accident occurred was renamed 'Birkins Bend.' From 1928 practice sessions for the Isle of Man TT Races and Manx Grand Prix were held on closed-roads for racing.
The Rhencullen complex of bends including Birkin's Bend was subjected to road widening and reprofiling during the winter of 1953/1954 for the 1954 Isle of Man TT Races.

<doc id="21606418" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21606418" title="Ted Pickett">
Ted Pickett

Edward Arthur "Ted" Pickett, OAM (2 April 1909 – 29 January 2009) was a leading Australian sportsman of the twentieth century, playing representative cricket, Australian rules football, tennis, badminton, golf, billiards, snooker and athletics. He has been called "probably the greatest all-round sportsman Tasmania has produced".
Born in Ulverstone, Tasmania, Pickett was a leading sportsman while still at school, winning tennis's Pardey Shield, the most prestigious trophy in Tasmanian junior tennis, in 1926, and representing Northern Tasmania in tennis.
Cricket.
A wicket-keeper, Pickett began playing for Tamar Cricket Club in the Northern Tasmania Cricket Association alongside Laurie Nash. His skill behind the stumps led Pickett to his first-class debut for Tasmania aged nineteen on 19 February 1929 against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, scoring three runs and claiming two dismissals.
Pickett became Tasmania's first choice wicketkeeper but due to Tasmania not being a part of the Sheffield Shield, his first-class opportunities were limited and in six years played only eleven matches for Tasmania, scoring 86 runs at 7.16 and taking seven catches and five stumpings. However, Pickett is considered one of the best wicketkeepers to play for Tasmania with his stumping ability particularly impressive.
In a match against the 1930 Australian side en route to England, Pickett, who worked on the front counter of the "Launceston Examiner" newspaper, sought time off to play. Pickett's boss agreed on the condition that the paper got a photo of Don Bradman batting while Pickett was keeping. Unfortunately for Pickett, Nash got Bradman out lbw for 22 before the "Examiner's" photographer arrived.
At lunch, Pickett approached Bradman and asked for a photograph. Bradman agreed to help out as long as he did not have to put his pads back on. Bradman and Pickett strode out to the middle, Bradman took strike and Pickett crouched behind the stumps and a picture was taken, leaving Pickett to spend the next few weeks explaining to everyone that Bradman had not started a trend for batting without pads.
Australian rules football.
Pickett was also a leading Australian rules footballer, playing for the City club in the Northern Tasmania Football Association and winning the Tasman Shields Trophy for the NTFA best and fairest in 1935. He also played for Northern Tasmania for six years against visiting VFL sides.
Following his retirement from football, Pickett became a bookmaker in Launceston in 1938 and held a licence for 37 years.
World War II.
Pickett enlisted in the Australian Army on 16 December 1942, gaining the rank Private and was posted to the 12/50 Australian Infantry Battalion. Pickett served with the 12/50 in Darwin and surrounding areas. He was discharged on 16 November 1943.
Billiards and Snooker.
Pickett played in the Australian billiards championship four times and in 1955 was the first player to win the Tasmanian billiards and snooker titles in the one year. He played in three Australian snooker championships, and won the national title in 1955, becoming the first Tasmanian to do so. He had backed ₤100 on himself to win, ensuring his celebration expenses were adequately covered.
Pickett was Walter Lindrum's opponent in a series of charity exhibition matches held around Tasmania.
Other sports.
Pickett also represented Northern Tasmania in badminton and was one of the state's leading golfers. Additionally, as an athlete, he won numerous quarter-mile events at carnivals around Tasmania, including winning the 1928 Smithton and Latrobe quarter miles and finishing second in the Latrobe Gift.
That Pickett did not concentrate on one sport is considered to have cost him national representation.
Honours and legacy.
The Ted Pickett Shield, awarded to the winner of the Tasmanian snooker championships, is named in his honour.
Pickett was inducted into the Tasmanian Sporting Hall of Fame in 1994 and awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia on 11 June 2007 "for service to a range of sports as a player and coach at state and national levels, and through support for young sports people"
Ted Pickett's age of 99 years and 302 days places him third among the longest-lived of Australian first-class players and his living 79 years and 345 days after his first-class debut is a record in Australian cricket.

Sumako Matsui

She married in 1903 at the arrangement of relatives but divorced within a year.
In 1908 she married Seisuke Maezawa from the same country village and in 1909 joined Shoyo Tsubouchi’s newly established theatre group only to divorce Maezawa the following October 1910.
Matsui first became famous in 1911 for her portrayal of Nora in A Doll’s House. In 1913 after establishing the Geijutsu-za theatre troupe with the shingeki director Hogetsu Shimamura, she became an acclaimed actress thanks to her performance in the role of Katusha in Tolstoy’s Resurrection (translated by Shimamura). "Katyusha's song", written by Shinpei Nakayama, which she sang in the film, became a huge hit selling over 20,000 copies at the time. This was said to be the first "ryūkōka" song.
After Shimamura died of the Spanish flu on November 5, 1918, she committed suicide by hanging on January 5, 1919.
It was Matsui’s wish to be buried alongside Shimamura, with whom she had been having an affair. However, her wish was not to be granted and her grave lies with her family in her hometown of Matsushiro. Remains are also buried in the Tamon Temple in Shinjuku, Tokyo.
The movie "The Love of Sumako the Actress" was produced in 1947 based on her life.

Military interpreter (France)

Military interpreters in the French Army translate into and out of foreign languages for the French military. A sous-officier or interpreter officer serves in uniform, accompanying the French armed forces on all its foreign expeditions for 200 years. Today known as Officiers et Sous-officiers de Réserve Qualifiés Langues Etrangères (OSRQLE), they were formerly known as Officiers Linguistes de Réserve de l'Armée de Terre (OLRAT), Interprètes/Officiers Interprètes de Réserve de l'Armée de Terre (IRAT/OIRAT) or Officiers de Liaison et Interprète de Réserve (OLIR).
The unit was first set up for Bonaparte's Egyptian expedition, and so their insignia is a sphinx on a blue terrestrial globe divided up by lingual barriers, on a round grey circular background with rays symbolising each of the languages spoken by their unit
History.
French invasion of Egypt.
The 1931 "notice sur les Officiers Interprètes" by the unit's commander Abribat (a notice largely inspired by the 1876 "Les Interprètes de l’Armée d’ Afrique" by Laurent-Charles Feraud) began:
Conquerors have always been surrounded by interpreters, a necessity to keep their operations moving, but it took Bonaparte to formalise the military interpreter's role and function.
Training.
All military interpreter applicants are usually qualified enough for conducting interpretation right after being commissioned. But, there are several different courses they have to take before being attached to their positions. The courses vary a lot depending on countries, branches, positions and others. (Clooney Kim)

Mykonos (song)

Mykonos is the third single from indie folk band Fleet Foxes, from their 2008 EP "Sun Giant". It was released in the UK on January 27, 2009, by European label Bella Union; in the format of 7" vinyl as well as a digital download, and peaked at number 53 on the UK Singles Chart. The B-side is a live version of "Tiger Mountain Peasant Song" from their debut album. On May 5, 2009, it was released in the U.S. on Seattle-based record label Sub Pop, with the song "False Knight On the Road" in place of "Tiger Mountain Peasant Song". An alternate version of the song, with a track length of 3:39, was released on the deluxe version of their debut album "Fleet Foxes".
Track listing.
All songs written by Robin Pecknold.
Music video.
A music video was made for "Mykonos", and was directed by Sean Pecknold, singer Robin Pecknold's brother. It is entirely animated and is described by Pitchfork.tv as:
"... video imagines a fluid universe filled with triangles, castles and barbershop mustaches. It's a little playful... and a little creepy."
It depicts a pair of small origami triangles (representing feet) on an adventure through a world made solely of paper. They begin, sliding and falling downwards, onto various objects and buildings which collapse shortly after. As this happens, an evil face appears in the background, whose eyes follow the triangles. Eventually, the triangles find a bird, upon whose back they ride above the clouds, only to fall again and end up in a dark forest filled with long, thin legs walking around. They then enter a flying machine, and encounter a tall figure, which they push over a cliff, to fall with it, watched by rows of eyes. As the song slows, they continue to fall, into a fortress in which the figures walk along high walkways. It appears to be the home of the face, which is promptly destroyed by the triangles, who flee the collapsing fortress. The song fades as the triangles sink into the sea.
Reception.
Critical.
"Billboard" magazine said that "the second half of 'Mykonos' is salvation for the ears." "The New York Times" said of the track that there are moments when "the band members' high, honeyed voices melded into an imperfect swell reminiscent of the kind of church choir John and Alan Lomax might have captured with their 500-pound recording machine.."

Shelly Bay

Shelly Bay is a bay on the Miramar Peninsula of Wellington, New Zealand. The New Zealand Defence Force owned the land on Shelly Bay for 124 years until 2009. Shelly Bay was where most of the scenes depicting "Skull Island" in the 2005 film "King Kong" were filmed.
History.
Te Āti Awa settled on the bay before European arrival, Maru-Kai-Kuru was the name of the village sited at the northern end of the bay. 
In 1839 the bay was sold to the New Zealand Company along with most of Wellington. In 1907 the land was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy (during the Second World War it was the naval station HMNZS Cook), and in 1946 it was transferred again to the Royal New Zealand Air Force to accommodate up to 300 staff. The New Zealand Defence Force owned land on Shelly Bay until 1995 when the then Air Force Base was closed.
On 14 February 2009 the land was handed over to Taranaki Whanui ki Te Upoko o Te Ika as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement.
Future.
At the handover of Shelly Bay, Port Nicholson Block Settlement Trust Chairman Ngatata Love said the new owners "will work with all relevant communities so that, over time, everyone in the greater Wellington region will benefit from this settlement". The Wellington community made it clear that the land should have mixed use a potential mix of housing, shopping and commercial, with large tracts of it being kept green.
