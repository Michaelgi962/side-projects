Democratic Bloc (East Germany)

The Democratic Bloc (DB, officially Demokratischer Block der Parteien und Massenorganisationen) was an association of political parties and organizations in the GDR.
History.
In parallel with the working staff of the CPSU European Advisory Commission commissioned in early 1944 to develop the exiled Communist Germany own political concept. A first draft was on 6 March 1944 on a working session of the exiled Communist Party presented by Wilhelm Florin. The guidelines developed by the Soviet concept of the future Communist Party saw as a government. After the unconditional surrender of the Wehrmacht on 8 May 1945 and the Berlin Declaration of the Commander in Chief of the four victorious powers of 5 June 1945 was initially any political activity prohibited in all zones of occupation. After consultation by Anton Ackermann, and Walter Ulbricht Gustav Sobottka on 4 June 1945 in Moscow allowed the Order № 2 of 10 of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany in June 1945, the formation and activity of anti-fascist parties in the Soviet Occupation Zone. With its call of 11 June 1945, the Communist Party came to Berlin as first advertised to the public and for cooperation: 
In addition to the block at the zone level corresponding blocks were set up at the country level. In Brandenburg, the existing three members from the four-party anti-fascist and democratic unit block of Brandenburg on 28 konstitutierte November 1945. In Thuringia, was the antifascist-democratic bloc of Thuringia on 17 August was formed 1945th In Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt was founded on 29 August 1945.
By 1946, the KPD and the Soviet occupation authorities had cajoled the Social Democrats in the eastern zone to merge with the KPD to form the Socialist Unity Party. Ostensibly a union of equals, the SED soon became a full-fledged Communist party along lines similar to other parties in what would become the Soviet bloc. The SED and the occupation authorities soon pressured the other parties into forming a permanent coalition under SED leadership. This coalition presented a single, SED-dominated "unity list" in the Constitutional Assembly elections held in May 1949. Although voters were only given the option of approving or rejecting the list in less-than-secret circumstances, official figures showed 66 percent of those turning out approved the list--by far the lowest total to which an SED-led alliance would admit during the four decades of Communist rule in East Germany.
In 1950 it was succeeded by the National Front.

Hedwig of Gudensberg, also known as "Hedwig of Hesse" (1098–1148) was a member of the Gisones family. She was the daughter and heiress of Giso IV, Count of Gudensberg (1070 – 12 March 1122), Count of Gudensberg and Hesse and his wife, Kunigunde of Bilstein (d. 1138/1140).
Hedwig married in 1110 to Louis, the son of Count Louis the Springer of Thuringia. Her husband was elevated to Landgrave of Thuringia in 1131. After her brother Giso V, Count of Gudensberg, the County of Hesse and the other vast possessions of the Gisones dynasty fell to her and her husband and thus fell to the Thuringian branch of the Ludowingians dynasty.
In 1122, Hedwig's mother, Kunigunde of Bilstein remarried to Henry Raspe I, who was Louis I's younger brother. Kunigunde thus became her daughter's sister-in-law. Via these two marriages, the Thuringian counts inherited an extensive triple heritage:
In 1128 Hedwig gave birth to her son Louis II. In 1140, Louis I died and King Conrad III enfeoffed twelve-year-old Louis II with Thuringia. While he was a minor, Hedwig acted as regent.
In 1148, Hedwig founded Ahnaberg Abbey, together with her second son Henry Raspe II, who at the time administered the parts of Hesse held by the Ludowingians. A settlement grew between this abbey and the former Franconian royal court "Chasalla" (from , "castle"), on the left bank of the Fulda and this settlement developed into the city of Kassel, which became the capital of Hesse in the 13th century.

Caitlin Reilly and Jamieson Wilson v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions EWHC 2292 (Admin) was a 2012 legal case heard by the Administrative Division of the High Court in which Caitlin Reilly, an unemployed geology graduate, and an unemployed driver, Jamieson Wilson, challenged the Department for Work and Pensions "workfare" policy whereby the unemployed can be "forced" to work for private companies for their benefit payments. Under the workfare scheme, individuals have the right to opt out, but face having their benefits removed--something that makes participation in the scheme necessary for those who would be unable to support themselves without their benefit payments. The outcome of the case affects over 3,000 claimants and entails around £130m unpaid benefits. 
First High Court ruling.
On August 6th 2012, the High Court ruled (contrary to the arguments of Reilly and Wilson) that the scheme could not be considered slavery, and was not therefore a breach of Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights. On the other hand, it also ruled that the Department for Work and Pensions had breached its Regulation 4 (which required certain details of the Work Programme to be given to participants in writing). 
Both parties expressed their wish to appeal the judgement.
Court of Appeal and Supreme Court rulings.
On 12th February 2013, the decision of the High Court was overturned on appeal, with the Court of Appeal ruling that the work placement system was unlawful because parliament had not given the DWP lawful authority to impose such schemes and because the people involved were not provided with sufficient information about it. The Court of Appeal quashed the Jobseeker's Allowance (Employment, Skills and Enterprise Scheme) Regulations 2011. The court did not state whether or not the current case impinges on Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
The government appealed the judgement, but on 30 October 2013, the decision of the appeal court was upheld by the supreme court (which also stated explicitly that there had been no contravention of Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights).
Government retrospectively changes the law.
However, on 19 March 2013, before its appeal was completed, the Government also passed the Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act 2013 to retrospectively make its unlawful sanctions against benefits claimants opting out of the workfare scheme legal, in order to avoid potentially having to repay unlawfully withheld benefits payments of around £130m.
High Court ruling on retrospective law-change.
In response to the law-change, the law firm acting for Reilly and Wilson, Public Interest Lawyers, lodged submissions to the Supreme Court, arguing that 'the actions of the secretary of state … represent a clear violation of article 6 the European convention on human rights and the rule of law, as an interference in the judicial process by the legislature'.
On Friday 4th July 2014, Mrs Justice Lang, sitting at the High Court in London, ruled that the retrospective nature of the legislation interfered with the "right to a fair trial" under Article Six of the Convention on Human Rights. The government announced that it would appeal this ruling.

Siebert Sie-3

The Siebert Sie 3 is a single-seat Standard class glider designed and produced in Germany in the 1960s for club use.
Design and development.
Through the 1960s Paul Siebert's company had built Kaiser Ka 6 gliders under licence. Anticipating the end of this agreement, they began to design a successor with a relatively low cost and simple wooden structure but with performance enhanced by a more modern Wortmann wing profile. The outcome was the Sie 3, which first flew in September 1968.
The Sie 3 has a wooden structure and is largely plywood covered. The high set single spar wings have the same aerodynamic profile throughout, with an unswept centre section of parallel chord and constant thickness over 60% of the span and strongly straight tapered panels outboard. There are aluminium Schempp-Hirth airbrakes near mid-chord on the outer centre section, just behind the spar, and ailerons on the outer panels. The only fabric covering on the wing is over the centre section aft of the spar.
The fuselage is a ply covered semi-monocoque with a short glass fibre nose fairing; aft of the wing it gently tapers towards the tail. The single piece canopy blends into the fuselage profile. The narrow chord swept fin is an integral ply covered part of the fuselage carrying a broad, fabric covered rudder with a near vertical trailing edge that extends to the fuselage keel. A straight tapered, largely fabric covered all moving tailplane with a cut-out for rudder movement is mounted at the base of the fin. The Sie 3 lands on a monowheel well embedded within the fuselage, aided by a sprung tailskid.
The Sie 3 flew for the first time in September 1968, piloted by its designer. Its performance was similar to contemporary wooden gliders.
Operational history.
Siebert manufactured 27 Sie 3s in the four years after it received type approval in January 1972. Some were built by amateurs from kits. In 2010 twelve remained on the civil registers of European countries, seven in Germany, two in Denmark and one each in the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal.

Burevestnik-24

Burevestnik-24 is a Russian experimental civil piston ground effect vehicle (GEV) of an original design. The project authors classify it as an "amphibious vehicle" that, in their opinion, should facilitate its certification as a marine vessel and hence make the project more profitable.
General Information.
The apparatus construction differs from the traditional GEA's scheme which uses under-wing blow from the engines located in front. Designers of "Burevestnik-24" used a bi-plane scheme with the engines which are located on the top wing, look back and have pushing propellers.
The power unit consists of two piston 12-cylinder V-shaped AviaSmart engines of 412 hp each. The digital control system of the power unit increases fuel efficiency and also synchronizes the drag of two propellers.
The 8-blade pushing propellers placed in ring channels are made of carbon.
GEA consists of modules, and in unassembled form may be put into a standard sea container.
As of 2012 it is located in Mytischi, the Moscow region.
History of development.
A 16-seated model for testing of hydrodynamic devices was the first one; then a 20-seated model was created. The 24-seated Burevestnik is the 3rd stage. According to project managers, a 100-seated amphibian should form the 4th stage, however no messages have been reported neither in the press nor at the manufacturer's site.

The magazine was launched by "Madhyamam" on 19 February 1998 as a decennial contribution to the cultural area of Malayalam. The editorial team had at its head noted writer and journalist C. Radhakrishnan. In a matter of about 40 weeks it has established as a forerunner of Malayalam periodical journalism, true to its claim of providing a new reading culture. Besides literary pieces, in-depth political analyses and informative studies in science, sociology, politics and current affairs, it has also made its presence felt through trendsetting interventionist reportage of social evils and the struggle against them. For instance, the exposure of Naxalites having been killed by the police during Emergency was carried out by "Madhyamam Weekly" in an authentic, first person account by the policeman himself – a disclosure that rocked the state politics and led several groups to sue the Government even in the Supreme Court. "Madhyamam Weekly" has set new standards of cultural dialogue. It has by now covered issues like tourism, environment, political violence, communal riots, nuclear weapons, sexual abuse and whatnot. It is already a frontrunner among cultural magazines in Malayalam, along with another decades of experience behind it.

Phoenix (2006 film)

Phoenix is a 2006 film by American director Michael Akers, his third feature film after "Gone, But Not Forgotten" (2003) and "Matrimonium" (2005). The film was produced by Sandon Berg with Israel Ehrisman as co-producer and starred Chad Edward Bartley as Dylan, Gaetano Jones as Kenneth Sparks and Jeff Castle as Demetrius Stone. The film was distributed by United Gay Network. This film was inspired by Michaelangelo Antonioni's film L'Avventura and obviously adds a gay twist.
Synopsis.
"Phoenix" is the story of a suspenseful and mysterious journey of two jilted lovers following the trail of their mutual betrayer. Ken Sparks (played by Gaetano Jones) has had some urgent business matter to attend in Phoenix, Arizona after a land deal has gone sour. In the process, he is also leaving behind his lover boy friend Dylan (Chad Edward Bartley) making promises for Dylan's birthday. Despite Dylan having delusions that Ken might me the one for him, Ken on the other hand doesn't want Dylan to join in with him in Phoenix and makes empty promises to keep Dylan in
Betrayed by false promises, Dylan asks about him and discovers not only that Ken has altogether disappeared from the scene, but that he has had a long-term and ongoing relationship with his "husband" Demetrius Stone (Jeff Castle). Now Ken has also dumped Demetrius as well and just disappeared.
Seeing the joint predicament both lovers are in because of Ken's betrayal of them both, Dylan and Demetrius feel an affinity building up between them and eventually fall in love together. The film is sub-titled as "Every broken heart is a chance for a new beginning..." or as Dylan says to Demetrius: "may be this is destiny, and maybe this whole thing with Ken was just to bring us together" although they both obviously live in the spell of their common lover. And as they admit, "this is not easily done" and is "an awful lot of trouble to go through" and realizing this new love "cannot replace him ".
Screenings.
The film was an official selection on many festivals including:

She has served two six-month prison sentences resulting from trespasses during protests against the School of the Americas in 1997-99.
Rice became so known for her activism that the United States Department of Energy funded an oral history on her, to help understand her antinuclear views.
On July 28, 2012, Rice, at 82 years old, and two fellow activists (Michael R. Walli, 63 years old, and Gregory I. Boertje-Obed, 57 years old) broke into the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, spray-painted antiwar slogans, and splashed blood on the outside of the heavily guarded Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility. The three are members of the organization "Transform Now Plowshares", a part of the Plowshares Movement, which references the Book of Isaiah's call to "hammer their swords into plowshares", i.e., convert weapons into peaceful tools. Justifying their infiltration of the Oak Ridge facility, the trio cited both Biblical verses calling for world peace and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as justifications. The "New York Times" reported that nuclear experts called this action "the biggest security breach in the history of the nation's atomic complex." Rice, Walli, and Boertje-Obed were charged with misdemeanor trespass and "destruction and depredation" of government property (a felony) and may face up to a $100,000 fine and up to a year in prison. However they were charged with damaging a defense facility under the sabotage act, a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, and charged with causing more than $1,000 damage to government property, up to 10 years in prison.
On May 9, 2013, the three were convicted. In her testimony Sister Megan said "I regret I didn't do this 70 years ago." Her sentencing was originally scheduled for January 28, 2014, but was postponed to February 18, 2014 due to a snow storm. On February 18, 2014, Rice was sentenced to 35 months in prison, and Walli and Boertje-Obed were each sentenced to 62 months.

Heard Building

The Heard Building (alternatively the Greater Arizona Savings Building) is a 7-story high-rise building in Phoenix, Arizona, it housed the offices of The Arizona Republic (formerly the Arizona Republican) and the Phoenix Gazette from 1920 to 1948. The building was constructed between 1919 and 1920 and was the first high-rise building to be erected in Phoenix. It held the title of tallest building in Arizona for four years until the completion of the Luhrs Building in 1924.
History.
Construction of the building began on September 2, 1919, and was financed by Dwight B. Heard and the Commonwealth Investment Company as a new home for his investment and publishing ventures. The building was designed by Llewellyn Adelbert Parker, an architect formerly associated with Mayberry & Parker, who designed several other structures in the valley including the Central Avenue Bridge, the Goodrich Building, and the Goldberg Building.
General contracting was awarded to James William Martin who supervised the buildings construction. Contracting for plumbing, heating and ventilation was awarded to D. S. Horrall Company and the plans for heating and ventilation were drawn by Elliott Lee Ellingwood, consultant engineer. The building was plastered with cement by Scottish contractor Duncan MacDonald and a crew of eight men. It took them eight months to complete.
In the wake of a devastating 1910 fire that consumed the Adams Hotel, Heard committed to constructing all future projects out of concrete to reduce the chance of fire. The Heard Building is no exception. The entire frame of the building is reinforced concrete and although several minor fires were reported over the years, they were extinguished quickly with minimal damage.
The Heard building was sold in December 1951, to a group of New York investors for $710,000.
Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette.
When the building opened in 1920 offices of the Arizona Republican occupied most of the first floor and portions of the basement for printing press equipment. In 1930 the Arizona Publishing Company, parent company of the Arizona Republic, purchased the Phoenix Gazette and moved its employees into the offices of the Republican of the first floor.
Both newspaper publications were sold in 1946 to Eugene C. Pulliam and in 1948 they were moved to new headquarters.
Remodeling.
In December 1937 a reconstruction project was launched to modernize the facade and expand the offices of the Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette. The offices of the Dwight B. Heard Investment Company were moved from the first floor to the third floor to make way for the expansion. William Peper Construction Company was awarded the contract. The project was directed by E. W. Larson, general manager of the Commonwealth Investment Company, and William Peper. Architectural plans were drawn by Lescher and Mahoney with reconstruction expected to take 60 days. The buildings original elevators were replaced with modern automatic leveling elevators and the air conditioning system was upgraded the previous year.
KTAR.
In November 1929, the Arizona Publishing Company acquired a local radio station KFAD, later renamed to KTAR (Keep Taking Arizona Republic). During 1930, a 1000-watt Western Electric station was installed on the 7th floor and two towers were installed on the roof to support the antenna. Demand increased, and in 1941 KTAR moved transmitting to a new 5000-watt plant at 36th Street and Thomas Road, operations were still run from atop the Heard Building. The station was purchased by advertiser John J. Louis, Sr. of Chicago, Illinois in 1944, the studio was eventually moved to a new location in the early fifties.
Popular culture.
The building can be seen in the opening sequence of the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film "Psycho". The clip fades in centered on Hotel San Carlos, which is located on the northwest corner of Central and Monroe. You can see the former Arizona Bank Building under-construction just west of Hotel San Carlos, this building was demolished in 2005 to make way for the new 44 Monroe, Camelback Mountain can be seen in the background. When the camera pans to the right you can see the Heard Building in the foreground with its antenna, behind the Heard Building you can see the Professional Building.
In 1922 Bill Strother, the "Human Spider", climbed the face of the building and sat on top of the flagpole

Vrededorp, Gauteng

Vrededorp is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. It is located in Region B. Vrededorp is situated on the North-Western side of Johannesburg and is 1,764 m (5,788 ft)above sea level.
Originally populated by Africans, Coloureds, Whites, Chinese, Cape Malays and Indians, it was one of two adjacent suburbs (Pageview and Vrededorp) commonly and onomatopoeically known as "Fietas" after the Men's Outfitters that traded from 14th street in Vrededorp - hence "Fitters" and "Fittas" or, as commonly spelled, "Fietas". The then well-known 14th street was the area's business lane where everybody from across Johannesburg met to snatch up bargains. Most shopkeepers stayed in apartments on top of their shops.
History.
Vrededorp "Village of Peace", was named as such in 1895 because of the decision taken to give poor people squatter rights in the area. The idea was that these rights could later be transferred to the heirs of the people that were granted initial squatter rights. After the Anglo Boer War (11 Oct 1899- 31 May 1902), the British did away with the arrangement.
On the 19th of February 1896 Vrededorp, Braamfontein, Fordsburg and the Malay Location were flattened as a result of a huge explosion caused by a locomotive that reversed into two railway trucks that contained 1955 tons of unstable dynamite. This explosion is commonly known as the "Great Dynamite Explosion".
In 1908 the Indigency Commission started to criticize the living conditions of blacks in and around Johannesburg. This triggered a series of inter-related events. 1909 - the Johannesburg Municipal Commission suggested to make surveyed land available to "natives and other non Europeans". 1910 - Despite strong objections from the black community that they will be excluded from constitutional proceedings, the Union of South-Africa comes into being. Shortly after, in 1911, the first of many labour disputes happened. The next to follow was the founding of the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) in 1912, which later changed its name to African National Congress (ANC). By 1914 the situation deteriorated to such an extent that the Union Government had to place Johannesburg under Martial Law. 
By 1920 strikes and riots were at the order of the day and on the 29th of February a group of black people riot close to Vrededorp. In 1923 the Native (Urban Areas) Act is passed. This Act forced local authorities to take responsibility for the housing of Black citizens who live and work in their areas. By 1927 the Western Native Township was extended by an extra 1000 houses. The responsibility for the management of Native Affairs moved from the town's Parks Department to the Town Council. They appointed Graham Ballenden to fulfill this role. This appointment made him responsible for the black communities' housing. Soon after, the Johannesburg Council appointed a committee to take care of the Native Affairs. 
By 1928 the Eastern Native Township and the Wemmer Barracks Hostel were created. By 1930 the total number of houses built in the Eastern and Western Townships reached 2625. An amendment to the Native (Urban Areas) Act, saw to it that the Local Authorities gained additional power over the housing of the black residents. The Johannesburg City Council acquired a portion of the farm Klipspruit (No.8, sized 1300 morgen) to build housing for blacks. The Native Affairs Committee went about launching a competition for the planning of a Township. They named the Township after Orlando Leake, their Chairman. The Township had to be able to accommodate 80,000 persons. The idea was to resolve the overcrowded conditions in areas such as Vrededorp, Fordsburg, Pageview and Sophiatown. By the end of 1935, 3000 houses were built in Orlando. 
By 1939 an additional 8700 houses and 6912 beds were provided to blacks living and working in Johannesburg. In September this year South Africa declared war on Germany. During the next 5 years, influx control regulations were relaxed. Growing work opportunities attracted many blacks from rural areas to the city. However only 873 new houses and 358 extra beds were provided due to a scarcity of funds. As a direct result of this, informal settlements started going up all over the area. These areas eventually housed in the region of 60,000 people. In 1947 an attempt was made to close down the informal settlements. Baragwanath Hospital were allocated to serve the blacks and 1800 patients moved there from Johannesburg General Hospital. By 1955 a Resettlement Board was formed to remove blacks from Johannesburg's Western Areas. Shortly after over 60,000 people from the neighbouring area Sophiatown (now known as Triomf) were removed from their homes at gun-point, and resettled in the area now known as Soweto. These houses were then made available to predominantly low-income Afrikaner families.
The South African Apartheid Government declared Vrededorp and Pageview better known as Fietas a white area in 1962. Subsequently the area was cleared of non-whites by the apartheid government in the 1970s. Many homes were bulldozed, and housing for white people was built on some of the land, with large parts remaining undeveloped.
To date no land claims were settled in the area. Due to the uncertainty around the land claims the suburb is in a state of gross neglect. The settling of land claims is complicated further by the number of claims lodged. The problem is that there are more claims than there are properties in the area.

Shadow Boxers

Shadow Boxers is a 1999 documentary film about women's boxing by director Katya Bankowsky that focuses on the pioneering fighter Lucia Rijker and features an original soundtrack by Argentine singer and songwriter Zoel. "Shadow Boxers" had its international premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1999.
Synopsis.
Bankowsky began working on a film about women's boxing in the early 1990s, when she was training to fight at Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn. Filming commenced at the 1995 Golden Gloves competition, the first year the tournament was open to female participants, a group which included Bankowsky herself. After filming the Golden Gloves, Bankowsky began searching for the woman she thought would be the first truly great female champion. After meeting with Barbara Buttrick, founder of the WIBF, who was in the process of starting a global database of women interested in the sport, Bankowsky came across footage of Rijker and decided she would be the perfect subject for her film.
At the time, Rijker had left her native Holland to pursue an acting career in Los Angeles. She had been the kickboxing champion of Europe for 14 years and had wanted to retire from fighting, but Bankowsky telephoned her and convinced her that she would be the first world champion of women's boxing if she chose to pursue it. Rijker agreed to let Bankowsky film her as she took on this challenge, and the director followed her for the next three years while she worked toward winning the world title.
Response.
"Shadow Boxers" played at the Toronto and Berlin International Film Festivals and premiered domestically at the Seattle Film Festival, where it was runner-up to Wim Wenders' Buena Vista Social Club for the festival's Audience Award. "Shadow Boxers" went on to play in 30 other film festivals worldwide, including the Crétiel International Festival de Films de Femmes, where it picked up the award for Best Feature Film; the CMJ Film and Music Festival in New York, where it won the award for best editing and usage of music; the Florida Film Festival, where it won best first feature; the Santa Monica International Doc Festival, where it was honored as the best film of the festival; and the New Haven Film Festival, where it was awarded the Kodak Cinematography Award as well as the audience award. "Shadow Boxers" was given honorary screenings at Lincoln Center in New York and The American Cinematheque in Los Angeles.
In addition to its success on the festival circuit, "Shadow Boxers" was released in theaters in the United States and around the world before making its television premiere on the Sundance Channel and being released on DVD by Image Entertainment. The film's theatrical release received acclaim from many writers (press clips). The New York Post wrote "boxing hasn't been shown this creatively on screen since Raging Bull," and B. Ruby Rich, noted that the film "propels the viewer smack into the adrenaline-drenched, rugged, euphoric scene of women's boxing." Critics for the Village Voice and New York Times praised the film, and The Vancouver Sun called it "a perfect film about women's boxing." For press summary, please see link to press clips below.
Influence.
While in Toronto to show their film at the Film Festival, Bankowsky and Rijker met actress Hilary Swank, who Rijker later trained for her role in Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" at the invitation of the film's production team. Working with Swank introduced Rijker to the film's writer, Paul Haggis, who told her that he and Eastwood had watched "Shadow Boxers" multiple times. Rijker eventually took a role in the movie as one of Swank's opponents.

Public Sector Credit Framework

The Public Sector Credit Framework is an open source tool for estimating the default risk of and assigning ratings to government debt. The PSCF installation package was released on May 2, 2012. At the same time, source code was published on GitHub. The publishers, PF2 Securities Evaluations and Public Sector Credit Solutions, said that they released the software in response to the need for "transparent, objective and up-to-date government credit ratings." The project has similar goals to an earlier mass collaboration bond rating effort, Wikirating.
Description.
PSCF calculates government default probabilities through the use of a multi-year fiscal simulation and a default point, expressed in terms of a user-specified financial ratio. The proportion of simulation trials surpassing the default point represents the default probability for a given year. The simulation is typically created in an Excel worksheet. Each row of the worksheet represents a different user specified series. Series may contain random numbers, macroeconomic variables, revenues, expenditures and debt levels. In a typical simulation, random numbers are listed first, then macroeconomic variables are specified as functions of the random variables (as well as constants and previous levels of the macroeconomic variable). Revenues and expenditures can then be expressed as functions of the macroeconomic variables.
Antecedents.
The use of a fiscal simulation as a tool for rating government bonds appears to be unique to PSCF. However, simulation has been used as a tool for rating other fixed income assets
Technology.
The framework combines a user interface written in Microsoft Excel with a processing engine written in GNU C. Developers have expressed an intention to support a full open source run-time environment. According to PSCF's creators, Excel was chosen as the initial user interface platform because of its popularity in the financial community.
The PSCF user enters model parameters in Excel and then launches a control panel implemented in Excel VBA. When the user runs an analysis from within the control panel, his or her entries are converted to a C program, which is then compiled and executed. Outputs from the C program are returned to new tabs in the Excel workbook. The C program performs a multi-year budget simulation using random number generation routines from the open source Boost C++ Library.
Version 1.1 released in May 2013 added support for multi-threading, accelerating calculations on systems with multiple processors or multiple cores.
History.
The initial release of PSCF was accompanied by sample rating models for the United States and for the state of California. A preliminary model for Italy was published in July 2012.
After its release, the framework received coverage on "The Financial Times" Alphaville web site. Reporter Joseph Cotterill noted that the framework had the potential to produce "a view of sovereign credit free of the subjectivity and bias that could creep into more qualitatively-based ratings judgements." The framework was also covered in Government Technology News, 
in The Bond Buyer, and on Shareable.net, among other publications. The Shareable article described inconsistencies between corporate and government bond ratings that allegedly resulted in taxpayers paying for unnecessary government bond insurance.
In July 2012, the software was covered on The Lang and O'Leary Exchange, a prime time business program on CBC. Later that month, the developers of PSCF released an Italian sovereign default probability model which was reported in the daily version of Milano Finanza, MF.
In August 2012, the framework was presented at the Municipal Finance Conference at Brandeis University. describing the rationale for PSCF as well as its use.
In September 2012, PSCF was the subject of an article in a peer reviewed economics journal.
As of late 2013, PSCF had not been mentioned in other journal articles, but it has appeared in economist blog posts. Economist Krassimir Petrov discussed the weaknesses of sovereign bond ratings and the potential role of PSCF in improving them in a November 30, 2013 post in Naked Capitalism.
Canadian Province Study.
In October 2012, the Macdonald-Lauirer Institute published a study entitled "Provincial Solvency and Federal Obligations" which contained default probability estimates for the ten Canadian provinces generated by PSCF. The study's findings were reported by major Canadian media including the Financial Post, Globe and Mail, Macleans Magazine and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Illinois Study.
Another study using PSCF default probabilities was released in June 2013 by the Mercatus Center. This analysis, "Modeling Credit Risks in Illinois and Indiana", concluded that Illinois did not have substantial credit risk and that yields on Illinois bonds were exaggerated.

German People's Congress

The German People's Congress () was an initiative of the SED and the participation of the block parties at the London Conference of Allied Foreign Ministers in November / December 1947, delegates from all over Germany for the first time on 6 December 1947 that entered together body. His main demand was the key to a German government. The SED presented their all-German claim to the three people's congresses.
Historical background.
After the Second World War, the cooperation of the four victorious powers was soon superseded by the East-West confrontation. The growing East-West conflict between the USSR and the Western powers, such as the Middle East and Asia, as well as Soviet policy, satellite states to build (the so-called Eastern Bloc), led to distrust of Western powers in relation to the Soviet policy in Germany. U.S. demands in the Allied Control Council, to preserve the economic unity of Germany, were dismissed in July 1946 by the USSR as an attempt to influence. The four-power administration over Germany ended no later than the last meeting of the Supervisory Council on 20 March 1948. 
The London 6-Power Conference was set in the first half of 1948 principles for the establishment of a democratic German state (the Frankfurt documents). While in the three western zones of the reconstruction of democracy was, went in the Soviet zone of occupation, the increasing uniformity of the semi-free elections in the Soviet zone in 1946 elected democratic institutions vonstatten. Since not freely elected governments in the Soviet countries were reached, the Prime Minister summarized in the west of Koblenz decisions, according to which democratic West German state as a temporary part to the restoration of German unity should be established in the wild.
People's Congress movement.
The People's Congress movement was at the initiative of the Socialist Unity Party 26 November founded in 1947 and served as its first political forum for Germany to incorporate elements of direct democracy and civic groups in a representative government. They also used the SED to the involvement of political parties, mass organizations, cultural associations and individuals to achieve their political goals and was directed against the American and British policy and the Marshall Plan. Emerged from the movement of the German people's congresses, the first on 6/7 December 1947 of "delegates" of all occupation zones was composed. Prohibited under review and resistances against these SED initiative on the part of the Christian Democratic Union and the removal of its chairman Jakob Kaiser and Ernst Lemmer through SMAD Western occupying powers to mobilize the People's Congresses in the Trizone.
First Congress.
The First German People's Congress for Unity and a Just Peace went back to the initiative of the SED. It let delegates from political parties and mass organizations to determine who came predominantly from the Soviet zone of occupation. Only a small proportion came from the western zones. These representatives came on 6 and 7 December 1947 in Berlin together. Participation in the People's Congress, was among the parties in the Soviet zone of much discussion. The refusal of the CDU to participate was one of the reasons that led to the dismissal of Jacob Kaiser as CDU chairman by the SMAD. Under strong pressure from the occupying power against the will of the majority of national associations, the Liberal Democratic Party decided to participate. The crucial point of criticism was that the Congress should not be composed according to the election results. By including the mass organizations had a higher distribution of members of the SED, which were usually also members of mass organizations, possible from the outset.
According to estimates by Erich Gniffke was due to the political affiliation of most members of mass organizations to the SED 62% of the participant member of the SED, and another 10% member of the Communist Party. Although these estimates are at odds with the official figures (see table) are available, it is clear that the SED had a clear majority in the People's Congress. Topics included the rejection of the planned construction of a West German state and the criticism of the US-British occupation policy. They discussed the preparation of a peace treaty and an all-German government "composed of representatives of all democratic parties". Here, the Congress rejected much of the Soviet policy on Germany and supported this. This is the reason why this motion was approved by the Soviet Military Administration and supported by the SED. To represent the Congress appointed a 17-member delegation to the London Conference of Foreign Ministers (November–December 1947) the positions of the Congress. The foreign minister saw no legitimacy of the delegation and did not receive it.
Second congress.
The Second German People's Congress held on 17-18. March 1948. The appointment was with the 18th March at the 100th Anniversary of the revolution 1848/1849 set. At the People's Congress was attended by 1898 delegates, including 512 from the western zones. It rejected of the Marshall Plan, the recognition of the Oder-Neisse line, and a petition was agreed to German reunification, the 23 May to 13 June 1948 took place. He was the newspaper of "German voice" out. 
Furthermore, the First German People's Council was elected, which included 400 members, of which 100 were from West Germany. It was formed a constitutional committee, which was led by Otto Grotewohl and should draw up a draft constitution for the future German Democratic Republic.
Third congress.
The Third German People's Congress on the population of the Soviet occupation zone 15 and 16 May 1949 by one vote confirms'. The 'choice' for the People's Congress was to assent (Yes) or reject (No), the following statement:
More than four million of the approximately 13.5 million eligible voters have ticked no. On the approval (officially about 66% of votes) are still reasonable doubt, as about a million unfilled ballots were counted as agreement.

The Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket three and a half weeks later saw Sayyedati ridden for the first time by Walter Swinburn, who became her regular jockey. The race pitted Sayyedati against Lyric Fantasy, a sprinter who had defeated older horses in the Nunthorpe Stakes, and Poker Chip, the winner of the Flying Childers Stakes. Sayyedati led from the start and ran on strongly in the closing stages to beat Lyric Fantasy by two lengths. Despite Sayyedati's win at Newmarket, she was beaten by Lyric Fantasy for the title of European champion two-year-old filly at the Cartier Racing Awards, but was the clear winter favourite for the following year's 1000 Guineas.
1993: three-year-old season.
Sayyedati began her three-year-old season on April 13 at Newmarket in the Nell Gwyn Stakes, a trial for the 1000 Guineas. She started the 11/8 favourite but was unable to catch the front-running Niche, and finished third, beaten one and a half lengths. After the race Brittain expressed his confidence in the filly's capacity to improve, and Swinburn elected to keep the ride on Sayyedati in the upcoming Classic, despite having the opportunity to switch to another fancied runner. Sayyedati and Niche met for the third time in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course sixteen later. Brittain took extra precautions in the run-up to the race: Sayyedati's temperature was taken regularly, her manger was scrubbed between meals and her groom spent the night before the big race sleeping in her stable. In a field of twelve fillies, Sayyedati started second favourite on 4/1 with the French-trained Elizabeth Bay being made favourite. The filly appeared nervous before the race but Brittain was reportedly unconcerned, commenting that "only wooden horses don't sweat". Sayyedati started slowly but made progress in the second half of the race to overtake Niche a furlong from the finish. The filly was driven out by Swinburn to beat the Nell Gwyn winner by half a length with the outsider Ajfan in third, Lyric Fantasy sixth and Elizabeth Bay eighth.
After a break of three months, Sayyedati returned to race against colts and older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. Starting at odds of 11/1, Sayyedati finished strongly to finish second to the French colt Bigstone, ahead of a field which included Culture Vulture, Inchinor and Zafonic. In August, Sayyedati traveled to France for the Prix Jacques le Marois and recorded her fourth Group One success, beating Ski Paradise and Kingmambo in a closely contested finish. On her final European start of the year she finished fourth behind the colts Bigstone, Barathea and Kingmambo in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. She was then sent to California for the Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita Park in November. Rather than contesting the mile, she was brought down in distance for the Breeders' Cup Sprint over six furlongs on dirt, reportedly at the insistence of Maktoum Al Maktoum. She was never in contention and finished unplaced behind Cardmania.
1994: four-year-old season.
Sayyedati remained in training as a four-year-old, but failed to win in six races during a season in which Brittain's entire stable of horses appeared to run below expectations. In spring she was sent to Japan where she finished third to Ski Paradise in the Group Two Keio Hai Spring Cup and seventh behind North Flight in the Yasuda Kinen. On her return to Europe she finished fourth to Distant View in the Sussex Stakes (looking unlucky not to finish closer) and then produced her best performance of the year in the Prix Jacques le Marois, finishing second to East of the Moon, with Ski Paradise and Barathea fifth and sixth. Her last two starts were disappointing as she finished unplaced in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.
1995: five-year-old season.
Despite her lack of success in 1994, Sayyedati returned to the racecourse as a five-year-old mare. On her first appearance she moved down to Group Three level for the first time since April 1993 when she finished second by a head to the sprinter Cherokee Rose in the 1400m Prix du Palais Royal at Longchamp in May. A month later, she appeared at Royal Ascot for the first time and finished fifth in the Queen Anne Stakes. In July, Sayyedati ran in the Sussex Stakes for the third time. Ridden by the Australian jockey Brett Doyle the mare was towards the rear in the early stages before taking the lead approaching the final furlong. She was pushed out by Doyle in the closing stages to win by half a length from the favourite Bahri. In August, Sayyedati contested her third Prix Jacques le Marois. Doyle found himself in the lead on Sayyedati 300m from the finish, but the British mare hung to the left in the closing stages and was beaten a length by the outsider Miss Satamixa. Doyle admitted that he had gone to the front earlier than he had planned. A month later she returned to France for the Prix du Moulin in which she finished strongly to take fourth place, less than two lengths behind the winner Ridgewood Pearl. Sayyedati's second Breeders' Cup was more successful than her first, as she finished third to Ridgewood Pearl in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Belmont Park.
Assessment.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sayyedati a "average" winner of the 1000 Guineas.
Clive Brittain called her "a great horse and a pleasure to train. She had speed, class and a great heart."
Stud record.
Sayyedati was retired to become a broodmare for the Gainsborough Stud. She produced several winners, the best of them being the unbeaten colt Almushahar (sired by Silver Hawk), who won the Champagne Stakes on his second and final racecourse appearance. Sayyedati died in August 2007 at the age of 17.

Norman Aviation Nordic 8 Mini Explorer

The Norman Aviation Nordic 8 Mini Explorer is a Canadian ultralight aircraft, designed and produced by Norman Aviation of Saint-Anselme, Quebec. The aircraft is supplied as a kit for amateur construction.
Design and development.
The Mini Explorer was derived from the larger Hubert de Chevigny designed Personal Explorer, adapted to Canadian Advanced Ultralight rules. It features a strut-braced high-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The Mini Explorer is intended as a flying camper and so includes sufficient cabin space with couches for two adults to sleep and a kitchen. Due to the emphasis on fuselage volume the Mini Explorer is not a fast aircraft for its fitted power, with a cruise speed of about .
The aircraft fuselage is made from welded steel tubing, with wooden structure wings and all surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its span wing has an area of and no flaps. The cabin width is . Standard engines fitted are the Rotax 912UL, the Rotax 912ULS and the Rotax 914 four-stroke turbocharged powerplant. Construction time from the supplied kit is estimated as 500 hours.
Operational history.

Stain (heraldry)

In heraldry, a stain (sometimes termed stainand colour or staynard colour) is one of a few non-standard tinctures or colours (namely murrey, sanguine and tenné), which are only known to occur in post-medieval heraldry and are thought to denote a rebatement of honour. Almost none of these rebatements are found in fact of heraldic practice, however, and in British heraldry the stains find only exceptional use, other than for purposes of livery. 
Murrey.
Murrey (deriving from late Middle English, via Old French from Medieval Latin "moratus", from "morum" 'mulberry') is mulberry-coloured, or reddish purple.
Sanguine.
Sanguine (deriving from Middle English, from Old French "sanguin(e)" 'blood red', from Latin "sanguineus" 'of blood', from "sanguis", "sanguin-" 'blood') is a brownish red, or blood-red colour.
Tenné.
Tenné (deriving mid-16th century from an obsolete French variant of Old French "tane") (sometimes termed "tawny") is an orange-tawny colour, though "orange" may be considered distinct in continental European and African heraldic traditions.

People's Control Commission (East Germany)

The Soviet Control Commission () was a Soviet monitoring and management committee overseeing the leadership of the German Democratic Republic and was active between 10 October 1949 to 28 May 1953. Their legitimacy was justified in agreements that had been made by the victorious powers at the Potsdam Conference (17 July to 2 August 1945). After that, the military government transferred its functions for a transitional period to formally fine German administrative organs. It replaced the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, which had previously exercised the sole administrative authority in the Soviet zone of occupation. With the founding of the German Democratic Republic on 7 October 1949, the Commission was given the requirements to replace the military government. This meant, however, that the East German government could operate independently of the West. The Soviet Control Commission could always overrule the decisions of the commission in East Germany if the decision of the East German commission were considered at odds with the official Soviet policies. Local officials had little power to make decisions or revise the decisions made. They controlled both the government of the GDR and the state governments. It was considered the ultimate power of authority both in the Soviet zone and in the former GDR.
General Vasily I oversaw the Commission's creation, as head of the SKK Supreme Commander of the Group of Soviet occupation troops in Germany. Army . Chuikov became head of the Commission shortly thereafter. The SKK monitored the implementation of the "Potsdam Conference" agreements and the other Allied decisions in the GDR. They also had to represent the interests of the Soviet Union in the GDR. But they also supported the SED in their actions against internal and external political opponents. After the death of Josef Stalin, the Commission became known as the "High Commission of the USSR in Germany". The former political adviser to General Chuikov, Vladimir S. Semyonov, was appointed as the High Commissioner. The USSR ratified the Commission on 20 September 1955 by the signing the treaty with the East German government's "full sovereignty" of the GDR.
The office of the Soviet High Commissioner was abolished. In fact, the USSR practiced though to a control function, which was after the dissolution of SKK and the High Commissioner particularly exercised by the Soviet Embassy in East Germany and backed by the continued presence of Soviet troops in East Germany.

Peter Eastman (artist)

Peter Eastman (born 1 July 1976) is a South African artist, who lives and works in Cape Town.
Early Life and Family.
Eastman was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the United Kingdom to South African parents. He returned to South Africa at a young age and grew up in Johannesburg and Cape Town, where he is based.
Career.
Eastman is best known for a distinctive monochromatic style. Images held in shallow relief depictions remain nearly invisible until the spectator is positioned correctly for light to throw the images into relief, reflecting changing tone and colour. This technique was probably most successfully used in his monumental “Horse”, 2005.
In 2007, Eastman presented 'Supernature' at Cape Town gallery whatiftheworld. The naturalistic, rich and startling large-scale series of enamel and acrylic paintings on aluminium sheets, depicted the portraits of various owl species relating to themes of superstition and luck.
In 2010, Eastman exhibited a series of black portraits at Primo Marella gallery in Milan, Italy Curated by Yacouba Konaté.
Eastman was selected alongside 17 International artists to produce a poster for The 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Later that year the work was auctioned at Phillips de Pury in New York.

The Passion of Michel Foucault

The Passion of Michel Foucault is a biography of the French philosopher Michel Foucault authored by the American philosopher James Miller. It was first published in the United States by Simon & Schuster in 1993.
Within the book, Miller made the claim that Foucault's experiences in the gay sadomasochism community during the time he taught at Berkeley directly influenced his political and philosophical works. Miller's ideas have been rebuked by certain Foucault scholars as being either simply misdirected, a sordid reading of his life and works, or as a politically motivated, intentional misreading.
Reception.
Press reviews.
Writing for "The Boston Globe", George Scialabba described "The Passion of Michel Foucault" as an "intensely interesting" work which provides an "astoundingly vivid though non-prurient description of (mainly homosexual) sadomasochism".

Greater Manchester bus route 58

Greater Manchester Bus route 58 is a frequent bus route which runs between Rochdale and Middleton via Oldham. From Rochdale Bus Station it travels through Milnrow, Newhey, and Shaw to Oldham Bus Station, and then continues through Chadderton to Middleton Bus Station. It has a sister service 59 which operates on the same route between Middleton and Shaw, and also serves Rushcroft.
History.
The service was originally operated by GM Buses and operated on almost the same route as today. Evening services previously operated between Rochdale and Newhey, provided by Rossendalebus and Bu-Val Buses, although these journeys are now covered by services 181, 182 and 451.
The route has had some variations in the past. The service previously ran to the Trafford Centre via the M60 motorway until August 2008, where it was replaced by the 57 between Oldham and Trafford Centre (57 was withdrawn in January 2010). The service was extended from Middleton to Bury on behalf of Transport for Greater Manchester in October 2009, but this was withdrawn in July 2011.
Route.
Buses leave from stand J at Rochdale Interchange before heading along Milnrow Road (A640) towards Firgove, where the road changes name to Rochdale Road. Buses turn off the A640 into Milnrow town centre via Bridge Street, Dale Street and Newhey Road. The service continues along Newhey Road as it returns onto the A640 to Newhey. Once in Newhey, the 58 branches off onto the A663 Shaw Road as it heads into the Oldham area, heading past Dunwood Park into Shaw and Crompton.
The service turns off the A663 into Shaw town centre via Milnrow Road, Market Street and High Street before returning to the A663 Crompton Way at the Big Lamp roundabout. The service then heads towards Oldham via the B6194 travelling through Heyside and Higginshaw, passing close to Salmon Fields. At the junction of the B6194/A62, the service turns onto the A62 to head to the Mumps junction and Oldham Mumps Metrolink station. At this point, the service leaves the A62 and runs through Oldham town centre with the service taking two routes between Princes Street at Mumps and the bus station. Westbound buses run via Union Street, Clegg Street (former bus station), Yorkshire Street and St Mary's Way, while eastbound buses run via St Mary's Way, Lord Street, High Street and Yorkshire Street.
Leaving Oldham bus station, buses travel along Middleton Road (A669) through Westwood, Chadderton and Firwood Park. Buses then go past Mills Hill railway station where the A669 road renames to Oldham Road as the service continues to Middleton and terminates at the town's bus station.
Vehicles.
The main type of vehicle used on journeys on service 58 are Volvo B9TL's, which have route branding for the 58 and its sister service, the 59. The main alternative vehicle used on the route is Volvo B7RLE's, which were the previous prominent vehicle on the route.

Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón

Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón ( 1160–1231), also known as Gonzalo Ruiz Girón, firstborn son of Rodrigo Gutiérrez Girón and María de Guzmán, was one of Castile's wealthiest and most powerful nobles. He was based in Tierra de Campos, and was among the most loyal supporters of King Alfonso VIII of Castile, Berengaria of Castile, and later of King Ferdinand III.
Service to the crown.
A member of the "curia regia" of King Alfonso VIII of Castile, he was "Mayordomo mayor del rey" (High Steward) from 1198 until the king's death in 1214. Along with his brothers Rodrigo, Pedro, Nuño, and Álvaro, he took part in the Battle of Navas de Tolosa which occurred on 16 July 1212. 
After the death of King Alfonso, he was the High Steward of King Henry I until he was replaced on 29 December 1216 by Martín Muñoz de Hinojosa at the urgings of Count Álvaro Núñez de Lara, who in 1215 had made himself the young king's guardian, contrary to the wishes of the church and the nobility. This led to Gonzalo and his supporters distancing themselves from the crown and joining a party of nobles loyal to the king's sister Berengaria.
In February of 1216, during the uprising of Álvaro Núñez de Lara, he took part in an extraordinary parliament along with other Castilian nobles including Lope Díaz de Haro, Alfonso Téllez de Meneses ""el Viejo"", Álvaro Díaz de Cameros, and others, where they agreed, with the support of Berengaria (sister of the young king Henry I), to form a common front against Álvaro Núñez. By the end of May the situation in Castile had become dangerous for Berengaria, so she decided to take refuge in the castle of Autillo de Campos, a property of Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón, and sent her son Fernando to the court of León and his father, King Alfonso IX. On 15 August 1216 a meeting was held among all the nobility of the Kingdom of Castile to try to reach an accord and avoid civil war, but their disagreements led the families of Girón, Téllez de Meneses, and Haro to distance themselves definitively from Álvaro Núñez de Lara.
According to the "Crónica latina de los reyes de Castilla", the year 1217 was one of great tension, such as never had occurred in Castile before. Álvaro Núñez de Lara refused to renounce the power he had gained thereto and harassed the forces that remained loyal to Berengaria, laying waste to the valley of Trigueros and besieging Autillo de Campos, where Berengaria and her partisans were located, as well as Cisneros and Frechilla.
Circumstances changed suddenly when King Henry died on 6 June 1217 after receiving a head wound from a roof tile that came loose accidentally while he was playing with other children in the palace of the Bishop of Palencia, Tello Téllez de Meneses. Álvaro Núñez de Lara, as the young king's guardian, tried to keep the matter quiet, bringing the king's body to the castle of Tariego, but he could not prevent the news from reaching Queen Berengaria.
Immediately, Berengaria charged Lope Díaz de Haro, Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón, and Alfonso Téllez de Meneses with the task of discreetly fetching her son Ferdinand, who at the time was in Toro with his father King Alfonso, using as pretext the possibility of an attack on Autillo and without revealing the news of her brother's death. Despite the hesitation of the "infantas" Sancha and Dulce, the nobles were able to convince the King that King Henry was alive and well, thereupon leaving Toro with Ferdinand. Berengaria, the legitimate heiress to the throne of Castile, renounced it in favor of her son Ferdinand, who shortly thereafter was proclaimed king in Autillo de Campos on 14 June 1217.
On 20 September of that year, Alfonso Téllez de Meneses took Álvaro Núñez de Lara prisoner, and Álvaro was obliged to hand over some fortresses. On 11 November a generous truce was signed, allowing members of the House of Lara to recover their liberty and privileges. As soon as he was released from prison, however, Álvaro once again defied his enemies Alfonso Téllez de Meneses, Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón, and Lope Díaz de Haro, but he died while laying siege to them in the fortress of Castrejón de Trabancos, where they had taken refuge after an initial defeat. His brother Fernando Núñez de Lara made his way to Morocco, where he placed himself in the service of Caliph Yusuf II. The Pact of Toro of 26 August 1218 ratified the truce and put an end to the conflict.
Political office and landed estates.
Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón consolidated his position after the kingdom was once again at peace and the threat posed by Count de Lara and his brothers had faded away. He was High Steward for King Ferdinand III and a distinguished member of the "curia regia". He held several feudal estates at different times, including Monzón, Liébana, La Pernía, Gatón de Campos, Herrín de Campos, Peñas Negras, Cervera, Guardo, half of the important holding Carrión (shared with his brother Rodrigo Rodríguez Girón), the castle of Torremormojón, where he succeeded his father in 1194, and the distant castle of Entrepeñas, near the Monastery of San Román de Entrepeñas, in Santibáñez de la Peña. He also held several properties in Boadilla de Rioseco, Cardeñosa de Volpejera, Revenga de Campos, Villasabariego de Ucieza, and Cordovilla. In 1221, King Ferdinand repaid Gonzalo for his loyalty and services rendered by granting him the lordship of Autillo de Campos, a favor later granted his descendants by subsequent monarchs.
Charity.
In 1209, along with his first wife, he founded the Hospital de la Herrada in the district of San Illodo y San Antonino in Carrión on the Way of Saint James, with the purpose of giving alms and lodging to the pilgrims and treating their illnesses. They entrusted its administration to the Diocese of Palencia.
Gonzalo died around 1231 and was buried in the Hospital de la Herrada which he had founded.
Marriages and descendants.
He first married, around 1185, Sancha Rodríguez (died between 1209 and 1212). In his 1697 study of the Lara family, Luis de Salazar y Castro suggested she was daughter of a Rodrigo Rodríguez appearing in documents without further identifying details, in turn made son of count Rodrigo González de Lara by the "infanta" Sancha Alfonso. In this he has been followed by many more recent works. However, a recent survey of the Lara by Antonio Sánchez de Mora dismisses this connection as being without basis, a deliberate attempt to give the Girón prominent ancestry. Based on an ancient pedigree of the patrons of the monastery of Santa María de Ferreira de Pallares, Jaime de Salazar y Acha has asserted that she was the daughter of Rodrigo Fernández de Toroño, "alférez" to the king, and Aldonza Pérez, daughter of Pedro Muñoz de Carrión, a landholder in Aranga and a descendant of the Banu Gómez and of the Galician nobleman Pedro Froilaz. 
An illuminating document, cited by several authors, mentions all of his children from both his marriages, except Gonzalo. On 8 May 1222, in the records of the Palencia Cathedral, Gonzalo, High Steward of the King, in the company of his children and second wife, affirmed that the gift of a hospital in the district of San Zoilo in Carrión, along with all its rights and privileges, was to be restored to Palencia's episcopal see in perpetuity. The children of the first marriage were:
Around May of 1213, Gonzalo married, for the second time, Marquesa Pérez, who may have come from the Villalobos family or the Manzanedo family, although her parentage has not been confirmed. Together they signed a document of 1222 mentioning the children of this marriage, all of whom were minors at that date. In 1224, along with his wife Marquesa, he donated the church of Santa María de Baquerín to the Hospital de la Herrada which he had founded. The children of this second marriage, who lack the historical relevance of the first, were:

Northern Crossroads

Northern Crossroads is a MUD, or Multi-User Dungeon. It is a multiplayer real-time virtual a text-based multiplayer online role-playing game. The release of DikuMUD, which was inspired by AberMUD, led to a virtual explosion of hack and slash MUDs based upon its code. This is the base for Northern Crossroads aka NCMUD's code.
Description.
Northern Crossroads is a diverse world of blade wielders, assassins and magic users who use their powers together to seek out the darkest dungeons. Decide between five classes, as allowed by your choice of ten races, and prove your strength to ascend to an Advanced class. Venture to dangerous zones with other mortals, claim the rarest of items, join one of several clubs and build your character to challenge other mortals. NC has enthralled players with hundreds of detailed areas of various themes since 1992 and is one of the older MUDs still in existence receiving updates to code and new features.
History.
Northern Crossroads code base is Viemud code that was given to the original coders (Encino, Zapper and Nemisis) in the early 1990s by the original creators Cyron and Mallins. They called this mud Northern Gates. After some time there began a rift to form between Encino, Zapper and Nemisis. Encino and Zapper Started the Mud Northern Crossroads. Nemisis was not seen from again.
After some time of coding for the mud Zapper decided to leave the mud to peruse other interests. During this time Unknown came to the mud. After his departure another coder by the name Apollo joined the mud for a short time and left. He was followed by a coder named Nixdorf. After some controversy he left without a word. The mud was much too big for only a few people to work on. This prompted the advancement of Ottomix and Victor to the rank of Committee. But after only a few months Ottomix left the mud. Victor broke ethics of the mud and rules and was dismissed from his position. All this happened within a 2 year period of starting the mud. 
Growing tired of the responsibilities of the mud Encino and Unknown turned over the mud to the Execs' to run for them while they took a much needed break after years of working to make the mud a better place. The mud is then put on a server in Europe and ran by a player name Jaguar. But after one week, a player named Forge came to the mud and continues the coding work in Unknown and Encino's absence. He was promoted to Committee on 11/25/1994. Soon after beginning his work he realized he needed help with the huge task ahead of him and brought LSD to assist him. After seeing the new changes being brought about Ottomix had also returned to the mud. The quickly took back the mud and brought it back to its rightful place in Canada. Jaguar was given the code to create his own mud named Mystic Isles based out of Scotland. 
After some time other Comms where added to the mud Rygar of Waterloo, Caveman of New York, Byron of California, and Ardath of Nevada. During this time the mud was having problems finding reliable hosting and was moved around from different servers for a while. (This will continue until present until the mud lands on Linode hosting). 
After searching long and hard three more players where found to have exception coding ability and they were also added to the list of Committee. Molecular 06/11/1997, Slik 01/07/1997, and Ruinan 01/07/1997. 
Over the years many Comm’s have come to help shape NCMUD into what it is today. Here is a list of the comms’ that have been added over the years since 1997.

During the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the flag bearers of 205 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) arrived into the main Olympic Stadium. The flag bearers from each participating country entered the stadium informally in single file, and behind them marched all the athletes without any distinction or grouping by nationality. The blending of all the athletes is a tradition that dates from the 1956 Summer Olympics, after a suggestion by Australian-born British student John Ian Wing, who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as "one nation." The flags of each country were not necessarily carried by the same flag bearer as in the opening ceremony.

<doc id="36698308" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36698308" title="Afghan Local Police">
Afghan Local Police

The Afghan Local Police (ALP) is a US-UK sponsored local law enforcement agency, defence force and militia in Afghanistan as part of the Afghan Ministry of Interior. Formed primarily as a local defence force against Taliban insurgents its members have no power of arrest and are only authorised to investigate crime if requested to do so by the Afghan National Police (ANP). It was established at the request of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Summer 2010 and is paid for by the United States. Officers undergo three weeks military and police training by ISAF personnel and receive weapons and a uniform. They are intended to defend their villages from insurgent attack and allow the ANP to focus on offensive operations. It was originally intended to function for between two and five years.
The US government provided funding in February 2013 to expand the ALP to 45,000 members and to provide the programme until at least 2018, anticipating the withdrawal of most foreign troops from the country by the end of 2014. The ALP has received a mixed press with its members being involved in several green on blue attacks, though it has borne a heavy cost in its fight against the Taliban - suffering casualty rates twice that of the ANP and Afghan Army.
Formation.
The Afghan government passed legislation to establish the Local Police in July 2010 and formal establishment occurred under a presidential decree of 16 August that year. An initial target of 10,000 members was set by the Afghan government and the US Congress agreed to provide funding for up to 30,000 policemen. It was originally planned to operate for between two and five years. By August 2011 7,000 men had been recruited. Nomination and vetting is made by local village councils, with training provided by ISAF (primarily US) forces. ALP members report to the police district chief and come under the remit of the Ministry of Interior. The ALP was established with the backing of US General David Petraeus but with strong opposition from Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The US Combined Forces Special Operations Component Command- Afghanistan (CFSOCC-A) manages the American component of the programme.
Operation.
The ALP was established as an armed defence force at village-level and does not have police powers. It was intended to free Afghan security forces from the defensive role and allow them to focus on offensive operations in advance of the withdrawal of foreign military units from Afghanistan. ALP candidates receive three weeks of training some of which is delivered by US special forces personnel. The training primarily covers military skills such as marksmanship and IED detection but also covers human rights, the correct use of force and the Afghan constitution. ALP officers do not have powers of arrest but can detain individuals for a limited amount of time before turning them over to the national police. The ALP is not intended to investigate crime (and can do so only if asked by the National Police) and is uniformed in khaki in contrast to the Afghan National Police's (ANP) blue uniforms. The Local Police are not permitted to carry arms outside of their home districts ALP officers hold a one year employment contract, there is a provision in place for officers to transfer to the ANP or the Afghan Army upon completion of their one year service.
The ALP is intended to provide a local security presence whose members are known to those that they seek to protect. Previously this work fell to the Afghan National Police who were often sent from further afield and sometimes could not even speak the language of the local populace. A target of 30 ALP officers per village and 300 in each district has been set by CFSOCC-A. Potential recruits are biometrically screened in conjunction with the Afghan National Directorate of Security for potential criminal or terrorist connections. Potential ALP officers must be Afghan nationals aged between 19 and 45, demonstrate patriotism and be fit and healthy. Monthly salaries are between 6,000 and 8,250 afghanis per month. The US government funds ALP salaries, weapons, ammunition and training through the Afghan Security Forces Fund that provides the finance direct to the Ministry of Interior. The ultimate goal is for ALPs to function independently of the US security forces with all ALP posts seeking to be independent by the end of 2014.
In February 2013 the US government announced plans to expand the ALP programme. The Pentagon will provide an additional $1.2 billion to extend the programme to at least 2018 and provide for 45,000 officers. US military commanders hope that the programme will allow for the withdrawal of the majority of US troops by 2014 with only a small cadre of special forces personnel remaining to provide training to ALP officers and other Afghan security forces. As of February 2013 the ALP had a presence in just 100 of Afghanistan's 400 districts, though plans were in place to expand this to a further 44 districts within the next few months.
Incidents.
The Human Rights Watch has raised concerns that the ALP simply provides arms and training to another militia and has led to abuses of power by its members. At least 77 ALP officers had been investigated for criminal activity by February 2013, this included serious allegations of murder and rape. Concerns have also been raised over the power it places in the hands of local village elders, the increased proliferation of weapons, the possible infiltration by Taliban, the financial cost and the reliance on western trainers. The use of the ALP has been likened to a local militia, the use of which by the USSR in the 1980s left Afghans wary of similar forces.
The Local Police have been involved in several green on blue attacks against ISAF security forces or their Afghan colleagues. On 30 March 2012 a local policeman poisoned and shot nine of his colleagues in an attack he carried out on behalf of the Taliban in Yayakhil, Paktika Province. A local policeman killed two US soldiers in Kinisk, Farah Province on 17 August 2012 after he was handed a weapon to begin training with. The policeman was shot dead by US and Afghan forces and a National Police officer was wounded. Following a spate of such attacks the US military halted training to the ALP in September 2012 to re-vet new candidates, existing members of the force were not affected by the decision. A local policeman who had infiltrated the organisation drugged and, with Taliban forces, shot 11 colleagues and six co-operating civilians at an ALP post in Ghazni Province, the worst such incident the force has suffered.
The Afghan Local Police have been targeted by insurgents on numerous occasions. An attack on an ALP post in Khaki Safed, Farah Province in April 2012 left eight policeman dead and two captured and within the same timeframe a suicide bombing in the north of the country killed an ALP commander and his bodyguard and wounded 18 others. Another attack towards the end of the month killed 10 ALP officers when a roadside bomb hit the truck they were travelling in. Four policemen and five civilians were killed in a targeted suicide bombing on 18 June 2012 at Tagab in Kapisa Province, 17 civilians were wounded. Six ALP officers were killed in an explosion on 10 October 2012 in Nad Ali in Helmand Province. In all the casualty rate in the ALP runs at 6.2%, more than double that of the rest of the Afghan security forces.

Mellerio dits Meller

Mellerio dits Meller is a French jewellery house, founded in 1613, and still active today. It claims to be the oldest family company in Europe. It gives its name to the Mellerio cut, a 57-facet jewel cut, shaped as an oval within an ellipse. Today Mellerio is based in rue de la Paix, Paris, with branches in Luxembourg and Japan. It is a member of the Comité Colbert and also of Les Hénokiens, an international club made up of family companies over 200 years old. Directors François and Olivier Mellerio are the fourteenth generation to run the family business.
History.
The firm started in 1613, founded by the Mellerio family from Valle Vigezzo, under the patronage of Marie de Médicis.
Jean-Baptiste Mellerio (1765-1850) started trading in Versailles in 1777, and attracted the patronage of Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1796, he set up shop on rue Vivienne, Versailles, retaining the patronage of the Empress Josephine.
Francois Mellerio (1772-1843) moved the firm to Paris, initially at 4, rue du Coq Saint-Honoré. In 1815, he moved the workshop to 9, rue de la Paix in Paris, where it remains today. After the restoration of the French monarchy in 1830, Mellerio became suppliers to Queen Marie-Amélie and King Louis-Philippe.
Jean-François Mellerio (1815-1896) opened a branch in Madrid in 1850 from which he supplied customers including Queen Isabella II and the future Empress Eugenie of France.
The company's estimated sales (in 2010/2011) were €8 million.
Notable works.
Trophies.
Mellerio made the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy, awarded to the winner of the Men's Singles competition at the French Open. since 1981. It is in the form of a large silver bowl, with a vine leaf trim. Winners receive a pure silver replicas of the trophy, specially made and engraved for each winner by the maison Mellerio.
Mellerio has made the ceremonial sword for members of the Académie française, including François Cheng. Each sword is unique, with the hilt decorated with symbols of its owner’s achievements.
Tiaras and royal jewels.
The Mellerio Shell tiara was given to Infanta Isabella of Spain as a wedding present from her mother Queen Isabella II in 1868. The tiara had been made by Mellerio for the 1867 Paris Exhibition. It is made of diamonds in the shape of shells decorated with pearls. It remains part of the Spanish Royal Family jewels, worn today by Queen Sofia of Spain.
Mellerio is also attributed with the creation of the Spanish Floral Tiara, made of diamonds in a pattern of flowers, which was a wedding gift to the future Queen Sofia from General Franco on her marriage to Juan Carlos of Spain in 1962.
The jewel collection of the Dutch royal family includes two tiaras made by Mellerio for Queen Emma. The ruby tiara is part of a set made in 1889. The sapphire tiara was originally made in 1881. An all-diamond setting of the tiara was worn by Princess Mabel on her wedding day in 2004.
Mellerio also made the rose pattern diamond tiara bought by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy for the 1868 wedding of his son, Prince Umberto, to Margherita of Savoy.
A 1742 peacock brooch by Mellerio was worn by Anita Delgado as princess of Kapurthala.
Mellerio family.
At one time, the family owned the Pavilon de Musique in Versailles, built for Princess Marie Joséphine of Savoy.

"Battle Scars" is a song performed by Australian recording artist Guy Sebastian and American rapper Lupe Fiasco. It was released digitally in Australia and New Zealand on 10 August 2012 by Sony Music Entertainment. The song lyrics and music were written by Sebastian and David Ryan Harris, with the rap written by Fiasco. It was the third single lifted from Sebastian's seventh album "Armageddon". Fiasco added "Battle Scars" to his fourth album, "" in countries other than Australia. It was released as the fourth single on 28 August 2012, credited as a duet.
"Battle Scars" debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart in its first week of release and has been certified 9× platinum. It was Sebastian's tenth of 12 top ten singles in Australia and sixth to reach number one, and Fiasco's third top ten and first number one single. "Battle Scars" was the third highest selling single in Australia in 2012, the highest selling single by an Australian act. Sebastian received Aria Award nominations for Best Pop Release and Best Male Artist for the song. "Battle Scars" also reached number two and double platinum certification in New Zealand.
In the United States "Battle Scars" peaked on the "Billboard" charts at number 71 on the Hot 100, number 23 on the Digital Song Chart and number one on the R&B/Hip-hop Digital Song Chart. The song spent 20 nonconsecutive weeks in the Hot 100 and has been certified platinum. "Battle Scars" also reached number two in Norway. It was nominated for a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Duo, Group or Collaboration, and won the R&B/Hip category in the 2013 International Songwriting Competition.
Background.
"Battle Scars" is a song about the scars left from hurtful and broken relationships. In a radio interview Sebastian said, "It's about your own personal battle scars and for every individual those are different; some might be words or labels... it might be relationship scars. When I wrote this song, and when Lupe wrote his bits, we just really wanted it to be something that just inspired people to, sort of, confront those things, and also maybe try and work to think about burying and ripping up those labels; throwing them away."
Sebastian said Fiasco was always his first preference to contribute the rap, as he wanted to stay true to the theme of the song and found Fiasco's work very deep. Sebastian said, "He doesn't rap about booty shaking or cash, he's much more political and insightful and exactly what I wanted." He looked at other options as well, as he didn't know if Fiasco would be interested, and said he was overwhelmed when he heard Fiasco wanted to come on board.
Explaining why he agreed to participate in the song Fiasco said, "Guy's vocal performance first got me about the song because it's great and then the story of the song was attractive; I just tried to enhance it." Speaking of what it meant to have Fiasco collaborate on "Battle Scars" Sebastian said, "Just to get someone like Lupe on the track I knew it was going to have heart and have depth." He said of Fiasco, "He is a lyrical genius and he has really portrayed the emotion of the track". Sebastian says "Battle Scars" is his "proudest release", adding, "Every now and then in your career you release something that you feel has a deeper meaning and purpose. I don't know how it will chart, but I am really proud of it regardless of what it does.
Composition and recording.
"Battle Scars" is an R&B ballad with a hip hop rap, and is written in the key of F minor. Sebastian and Fiasco contribute equally in the song, with the sung and rap vocals intespersed throughout. Sebastian performs the pre-chorus and chorus, with Fiasco performing the intro and two rap verses. Both artists contribute to the bridge. Music writer and radio announcer David Lim said, "unlike the majority of these rent-a-rapper verses, Lupe Fiasco's contribution here actually feels valid and in equal weighting to Guy's sung vocals. I don't know, y'guys – it just felt like they spent a minute on this and it's not just another vanity project."
In interviews during the release week Sebastian explained that usually when he writes a song he comes up with the melody first with no words. However this time some of the lyrics came at the same time. While driving to a friend's house he started singing "These battle scars", and then other phrases such as "Don't look like they're fading, don't look like they're ever going away" came to him. These words form part of the chorus, which is used repeatedly during the song, and is one of its two hooks. After completing the song with David Ryan Harris it was recorded leaving all the parts where Sebastian envisaged the rap should go.
When Fiasco was in Australia for Supafest he came to Sebastian's Sydney studio to record the rap. He already had two versions prepared, one with war themed lyrics. Sebastian decided to use that one without listening to the other one. Fiasco said he came into the studio with other rap pieces as well. One was the phrase "Hope the wound heals but it never does, that's cause you're at war with love". He explained that he does not feel fully confident musically when collaborating with other artists, and he had been prepared to discard those lines if Sebastian didn't like them. Sebastian decided to use the phrase as the intro and also three times in the bridge with slight variations to some of the words. It became the second hook in the song. Fiasco said, "I didn't recognise that. I just looked at it as a filler and maybe it will work. But for him to take it like 'No, that's dope and we're going to use it, and we're going to put it here and here', it was kind of like 'yeah thanks man'. It made me feel really good."
Release and promotion.
"Battle Scars" was serviced to radio on 2 August 2012, and released digitally in Australia and New Zealand on 10 August 2012, with Fiasco credited as a featured artist. The song was the most added track to radio in its first week in Australia, debuting at number 31 on the National Airplay Chart. It became the most played song in Australia in its seventh week, where it remained for two weeks. Sebastian was interviewed by media and music sites including Music Fix, BigPond Music and The Music Network to promote the single. He also had interviews with radio stations, and performed the song live on Austereo's nationally broadcast "Fifi and Jules Show" on 13 August 2012. Fred Day, a member of Three Wishez, who were in the final 12 of the 2011 series of "The X Factor", performed Fiasco's rap during this performance.
Fiasco added "Battle Scars" to his album "" in countries other than Australia, credited as a duet. It was released as the fourth single on 28 August instead of the scheduled release "Form Follows Function". Fiasco came to Australia in mid September to promote the single and the release of his album, and he and Sebastian performed it live for the first time on "The X Factor". They also performed the song in the US on the "Late Show with David Letterman" and at Fiasco's New York album launch on 27 September. It was used in the US in the TV promotion of the movie "Red Dawn". In November Sebastian and Fiasco performed "Battle Scars" at the 2012 ARIA Music Awards. Sebastian and Fiasco continued the US promotion of the song in early 2013, performing it on "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon" with The Roots, and on "Conan". The song steadily gained radio play in the US, reaching a peak of number 14 on the Mediabase Rhythmic Airplay Chart.
Reception.
Critical response.
"Battle Scars" has received positive reviews. David Lim wrote, "'Battle Scars' is a massive bruised ballad with a titan hook that just beats you down with no mercy. The ominous piano-driven ballad, punctuated with crisp beats resembles something Ryan Tedder would pitch to A-list American chart toppers.[...]This next step in Guy's career deserves to be an international affair and let's hope with top-notch singles like 'Battle Scars', he can begin to break new territories." Hip hop indie/pop site Hillydilly said of the song, "Aussie singer/songwrtier, Guy Sebastian, has linked up with Lupe Fiasco for this epic song from the his new album. Evidently this guy can sing because he sure does let it be known on 'Battle Scars'. There is also a perfect amount of Lupe on this track—he is not tucked away on some last verse shit, rather he is found throughout the song. This is a good one." David Fredrick from music discovery site Gigity wrote, "Guy Sebastian, the Australian pop/R&B singer just released a brand new track 'Battle Scars' ft. Lupe Fiasco and it is an instant classic that will surely grab your attention." Kate Winch from Mosca Media said, "In this effort, the combination of Lupe Fiasco's rap skills with Guy’s strong vocals results in a catchy pop, hip hop track thats chorus will become firmly entrenched in your head after just one listen."
Battle Scars also received positive mentions in a number of reviews for Fiasco's album. HipHop DX said, "The Guy Sebastian-assisted “Battle Scars” is another winner, oozing mass appeal without deteriorating into sloshy mainstream". Luciana Villalba from review site The Young Folk called Sebastian's voice "remarkable", and included Battle Scars in her list of "must-listen" tracks. A reviewer for Entertainment site Pop Culture Podcast wrote, "This one has chart topping single written all over it but due to its genuine lyrics and universal subject matter it doesn't feel like one that you have to 'sell out' to make." XXL Magazine said "Battle Scars" moved "towards mainstream without completely deviating", sacrificing little "sonically or lyrically, instead relying on booming pop/sung choruses to denote any notable shift." Colin McQuire from Pop Matters wrote that it showcased Fiasco's "knack for crafting a great pop hook" and the "piano-laden groove adds the texture it needs to be a bona fide Top 40 hit, and Fiasco's crisp broken-hearted rhymes illustrate the exact type of accessibility the track needs to gain commercial notoriety." ARIA named "Battle Scars" as one of the top Australian music moments of 2012, saying, "We all knew Guy had serious talent, but this year he took his song writing to another level with the single 'Battle Scars'.[...] One of the greatest songs of the year without a doubt.
Commercial performance.
"Battle Scars" debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart, becoming Sebastian's tenth of 12 top ten singles in Australia and sixth to reach number one. It was Fiasco's third Australian top ten and first number one single. Sebastian has achieved the most number one singles for an Australian male singer in Australian chart history, and is third overall for all Australian acts. Only Kylie Minogue and Delta Goodrem have achieved more. "Battle Scars" spent 12 weeks in the top five, including six weeks at number one, and was the third highest selling single in Australia in 2012, the highest selling single by an Australian act. It was certified 9× platinum in December 2013 for sales of 630,000. "Battle Scars" also reached number two and double platinum certification in New Zealand. In the United States, "Battle Scars" spent 20 weeks in the US "Billboard Hot 100", peaking at number 71, Sebastian's first song to chart in North America. In addition to the Hot 100, "Battle Scars" reached number 23 on the "Billboard" Digital Songs Chart and number one on the "Billboard" R&B/Hip-hop Digital Song Chart.
Accolades.
"Battle Scars" received an ARIA Music Award nomination for Best Pop Release, and Sebastian was nominated as Best Male Artist for the song. "Battle Scars" won Song of 2012 in the POPreplublic.tv. IT List Awards. The nominees are chosen by POPreplublic, with public vote deciding the winner. The song was also nominated for a 2013 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Duo, Group or Collaboration. The Awards are presented by the American National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "Battle Scars" won the R&B/Hip category in the 2013 International Songwriting Competition. The judging panel is made up of musicians, songwriters and industry experts, and songs are judged on creativity, originality, lyrics, melody, arrangement and overall likeability.
Music video.
The music video for the song "Battle Scars" was filmed in New York in locations including industrial areas with destroyed cars and burning oil drums and ruined derelict buildings, where Sebastian and Fiasco are shown performing the song. Individuals filmed in a variety of cityscapes are shown periodically, expressing their sadness and personal scars by writing and holding up signs with words that show how they feel. The words they use include "abandoned", "abused", "fatherless", "outcast", "empty", "slave" and "bullied". Near the end of the video they tear up their signs to symbolise moving on from their hurt. Reviewer Kate Winch gave the video a four out of five rating saying, "This video follows a classic music video style, showing the artists performing with additional actors staring wistfully in cut aways. As always, there is a reason that something becomes a classic and that is because it works – just as it does here."

Combat history.
Black September in Jordan.
The 5th Division, at that time an infantry formation, invaded Jordan during the events of Black September in Jordan, 1970. It was reinforced with two armoured brigades. After an ineffectual defence by the massively outnumbered Jordanian 40th Armoured Brigade, the 5th Division's attack was repelled with heavy losses on 22 September 1970 mostly through the efforts of the Royal Jordanian Air Force.
Yom Kippur War.
The 5th Division also saw action on the Golan Heights during the Yom Kippur War, being deployed alongside the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 9th divisions. The 5th Division, under the command of Brig. Gen. Ali Aslan, was responsible for the front south and east of Rafid, and north of the Yarmouk Valley. Although designated as an infantry division, it was actually a mechanized division. The 5th Division was the only deployed division which had its full complement of armoured and mechanised vehicles, with some 10,000 men, 200 tanks, 72 artillery pieces, and an equal number of anti-aircraft weapons.
Syrian civil war.

Non me lo so spiegare

"Non me lo so spiegare" is a song written and recorded by Italian singer Tiziano Ferro. It was released as the third single from his second studio album, "111". The music video for the song was directed by Paolo Monico. The song was also translated in Spanish and recorded by Tiziano Ferro himself for the Hispanic version of the album, under the title "No me lo puedo explicar".
In 2006, Ferro re-recorded the song as a duet with Italian singer Laura Pausini. This version of the song was included in Pausini's 2006 album "Io canto" and it was released as a single in March 2007.
Background and composition.
During an interview released in November 2003, Ferro revealed that the song was initially written for his debut album, "Rosso relativo", but it was not featured on the record for various reasons: "We didn't know if the album would have sold well, therefore we kept the song for the Sanremo Music Festival. If things would have gone bad, 'Non me lo so spiegare' would have been my entry for Sanremo".
The song is a pop ballad, described by "Musica e Dischi"'s Antonio Orlando as a "neoclassic Italian song". Orlando also compared "Non me lo so spiegare" to Claudio Baglioni's previous songs.
Live performances.
Tiziano Ferro performed the song in July 2004 during the Italian itinerant TV show "Festivalbar", broadcast by Italia 1. He also performed the song in March 2007, when he participated as a guest artist in the semifinal of the 57th Sanremo Music Festival. A live version of the song was also included in Ferro's live video album "Alla mia età live in Roma", released on 20 November 2009 and recorded in June 2009 during his concert at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.
Laura Pausini cover.
Laura Pausini recorded the song as a duet with Tiziano Ferro for her 2006's album "Io canto". This version of the song was released on 23 March 2012 as the album's third single. The Spanish adaptation of the song, also featuring Ferro on vocals, was also included in the Hispanic version of the album, "Yo canto".
Background.
During an interview, Pausini revealed that, before starting the recording sessions for her album "Io canto", entirely composed of covers of popular songs by Italian male artists, she had decided not to record duets with Italian singers. "I was afraid to obfend the artists I didn't call, I wanted to record duets with foreign artits only, so that they could give something new to these popular songs. But when I started recording Tiziano's song, there was something missing, therefore I thought it was the right chance to put our voices together".
Live performances.
Laura Pausini and Tiziano Ferro performed the song live for the first time on 30 January 2007 in Milan, during a venue of Tiziano Ferro's Nessuno è solo tour. "Non me lo so spiegare" was also performed as a duet with Ferro during Pausini's only 2007 concert, held at the San Siro Stadium on 2 July 2007. The concert was later released as a DVD under the title "San Siro 2007", and it was broadcast by Italia 1 on 11 December 2007.
In December 2009, Pausini and Ferro performed together the song during an episode of Rai 2's TV programme "Due", entirely dedicated to them.
Music video.
The music video for the song, directed by Gaetano Morbioli, was filmed at the Dino Studios in Rome. The ambientation of the video recreates a desert, with an old petrol pump and roadsigns pointing to the Midwest. Pausini and Ferro are shown on opposite sides of a parked car, representing two aching souls which cannot look each other.

TrapWire

TrapWire is a counter-terrorism technology company that produces a homonymous predictive software system designed to find patterns indicative of terrorist attacks.
History.
The company was named in August 2012, through the WikiLeaks releases, as a source of software that facilitates intelligence-gathering on U.S. and global citizens, using surveillance technology, incident reports from citizens, and data correlation for local police and law enforcement agencies.
Details about the program emerged in 2011, after Stratfor's emails were hacked and released. According to a report by Russia Today, a network of surveillance cameras was installed "In major American cities at selected high value targets (HVTs) and has appeared abroad as well." A software program analyzes the images to detect "suspicious" behavior. The program is reported to be a joint effort by Stratfor and Abraxas Corp (VA), but following an ownership change, Abraxas has no involvement in the technology venture. The report also refers to a 2006 article in which then-current Abraxas Vice President R. Daniel Botsch outlined TrapWire's capabilities:
In one leaked email, Stratfor vice president Fred Burton stated TrapWire is in place at every high-value target in New York City, Washington, D.C, and Los Angeles, as well as London and Ottawa.

TrapWire is registered as a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In the submitted document, the system is described in detail. The assumption is that terrorists are vulnerable due to their need to conduct pre-attack surveillance, "such as photographing, measuring and signaling". Such suspicious activities, as detected in imagery from Pan–tilt–zoom cameras or human reports, are entered into a database, using a "10-characteristic description of individuals" or vehicle information. The data is correlated across the network, claiming a "network effect" of increased security due to this correlation. The result is a TrapWire Threat Meter (TIM) level which may be monitored by security personnel. The system distinguishes threat and vulnerability information; the latter is not shared through the network.
Reaction.
Chief NYPD spokesperson Paul J. Browne denied that the department used TrapWire. The company's particular "intelligence for hire" methods have been characterized as "noting sleeze, rather than surveillance", although TrapWire has been characterized as being a data-mining company. WikiLeaks suffered DDoS attacks of over 10GB/sec for several days on its main domains, with mirrored supporter sites receiving up to 40GB/sec at times. "Trapwire" topped the trending topics on Twitter. The leaked documentation promptly became available via a number of mirror sites and on the anonymity network Tor. The story raised concerns about the surveillance-industrial complex vis-à-vis civil liberties.
Starting August 2012, Anonymous (group) launched a campaign of popular education (named #OpTrapWire). In September 2012, the group changed the operation's name to #OpBigBrother, #IDP13 and #optinfoilhat in response to the development of other similar mass surveillance systems in other countries or locations. Several days of "International day for privacy" have been organized (for example February 23, 2013).

Life and work.
Birgit Püve started out as a writing journalist for the Estonian weekly newspaper Eesti Ekspress. She quickly became a successful writer, winning several reputable awards. Yet, her love for photography led her to replace words with images. She took a loan and bought an analog camera, making quite a sudden turn. Besides her personal projects she now works for Eesti Ekspress as a photographer and photo editor.
Püve concentrates mostly on portrait photography and the presentation of human nature. With her widely acclaimed series "By The Lake" she portrays the silent and dignified world of the Russian Old Believers living in the culturally unique part of Estonia, on the shores of Lake Peipus, the biggest transboundary lake in Europe, which now separates two different worlds - European Union and Russian Federation.

Unity Pond

Unity Pond (Lake Winnecook) is the largest lake in Waldo County, Maine. It is within the towns of Unity, Burnham, and Troy. The main tributaries are Meadow Brook, Bithers Brook, and Carlton Stream. The sole outflow is Twenty-Five Mile Stream, via a wetlands to the southwest of the pond, which in turn feeds into the Sebasticook River. The pond is surrounded by almost 300 residences, of which slightly more than half are seasonal. It is also used for boating, fishing, camping, and swimming. Kanokolous Beach on the southwest shore and Burnham Town Beach are both open to the public.
History.
Europeans first settled Unity Pond in 1785. By the early 1800s, sawmills were established along the three main tributaries to the pond. By 1830, however, deforestation caused most of the sawmills to close. Deforestation made agriculture possible, which continued in the lands adjoining the lake well into the 20th century. Canneries were established in the area from the 1920s to the 1950s. As subsistence agriculture declined in the 1940s, it was replaced by poultry and dairy farming, and seasonal camps were built along the lake shore.
Water quality.
The pond has been subject to eutrophication caused historically by agricultural runoff and effluent from a canning factory, and is on the state Nonpoint Source Priority Watersheds list, owing to the occurrence of summer algal blooms caused by phosphorus nutrient addition by runoff water. The watershed area surrounding the pond consists of 16.2% developed land, 71.7% non-developed land (consisting mostly of forest), and 12.1% surface water. A total of 20 fish species are found in the pond, including 12 indigenous species. The pond is stocked with trout and alewife.

Ethnic groups in Moscow

Moscow is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in Europe. Although, the last census of 2010 reported 91.6% of the population was Russian, estimates say that a significant part of Moscow population are ethnic minorities.
Statistics.
According to the 2010 Russian census, top 20 ethnic groups were:
Largest minorities.
Caucasians.
The term "Caucasian" shouldn't be confused with the White race as it is used in the United States. The Caucasus is a geopolitical region just south of Russia. The Caucasus itself is diverse in terms of religion, language and culture. 
In modern Russia, "Caucasians" (кавказцы) is an umbrella term for people from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Northern Caucasus: Chechnya, Dagestan, Northern Ossetia, etc.
Armenians.
The Armenian community of Moscow is one of the largest Armenian communities outside Armenia and one of the largest ethnic minorities of Moscow. In fact, some estimates even say that Moscow's Armenian population is equal to the population of Armenian capital Yerevan.
Others.
Jews.
Jews were the largest non-Slavic ethnic group in Moscow before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Their number dwindled from 251,350 in 1970 to 53,145 in 2010. As most Russian Jews, Moscow Jews also migrated to Israel and the US for better life.
Jews began to settle in Moscow around the 16th century. In the 19th as the Pale of Settlement was instructed Jews were forbidden to settle in the city except for those who served in the army and after their end of service allowed to stay in the city. In 1848 there were 313 Jews in Moscow. In 1861, during the reign of Tsar Alexander II, "useful" Jews, such as scholars, merchants and artisans, were allowed to settle in Moscow and the number of Jews grew rapidly, in 1890 they numbered 40,000 men and the community built synagogues, schools and charities, many located in the Zarayadye quarter on the Moskva River and in Marina Rostcha neighborhood.
Nevertheless, after the assassination of Alexander II in 1881, a more radical policy was adopted towards the Jews. Jewish enrollment was restricted in schools and universities and in 1891 all Jews were forced out of Moscow.
After the Russian revolution in 1917 the pale of settlement was abolished and Jews were permitted to settle again in the city, many of whom were refugees. In the 1920s and 30s, the state promoted Yiddish-language arts and literature in an effort to influence its Jewish citizens. This resulted in a brief, rich cultural flourishing exemplified by the famed Moscow State Yiddish Theatre, whose inaugural production (1921) was a staging of Sholem Aleichem's stories with sets by Marc Chagall. In 1939 there were around 250,000 Jews in Moscow.
During WWII many Jews fled to inner parts of the Soviet Union but most of them returned at the end of the war and by 1970 there were again around 250,000 Jews in Moscow.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union most of Jews emigrated from the city. In that period there was a revival of Jewish religious life, the leading bodies of Russia’s Jewish organizations were centered in Moscow and a number of synagogues re-opened. In 2010 there were 53,000 Jews living in Moscow although it is estimated that there are around 150,000 people of Jewish origin in the city.

1862 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1862 Atlantic hurricane season featured six tropical cyclones, with only one making landfall. The season had three tropical storms and three hurricanes, none of which became major hurricanes. However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated. Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz initially documented five tropical cyclones in a 1995 report on this season. A sixth system was added by Michael Chenoweth in 2003 from records taken in Colón, Panama.
The first tropical cyclone was observed as a tropical storm offshore the East Coast of the United States from June 15 to June 17. The second and third systems were active in mid-August and mid-September, respectively, and both attained Category 2 intensity at their peaks on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale and neither made landfall. A fourth tropical cyclone caused flooding in Saint Lucia and brought heavy rain to parts of Barbados on October 5, but its track prior to that date is unknown. The fifth hurricane was known to be active for a few days in October off the East Coast of the United States. Finally, a sixth system was centered near Panama – between November 22 and November 25.
The season's activity was reflected with a low Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) rating of 46. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength.
__TOC__
Storms.
Tropical Storm One.
Based on reports from four ships, a tropical storm is known to have existed for two days in mid-June off the East Coast of the United States. It formed approximately 340 miles (550 km) east of Savannah, Georgia on June 15 and moved slowly north before dissipating two days later, while located about 250 miles (400 km) east of Virginia Beach, Virginia.
Hurricane Two.
A Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale was first seen on August 18, while located approximately 620 miles (1,000 km) east of Florida. Over the next three days, it tracked north and moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The system dissipated roughly 310 miles (500 km) south of Newfoundland on August 21.
Hurricane Three.
On September 12, a Spanish ship, the "Julian de Unsueta", was de-masted by a strong gale and thrown onto its beam ends. A few days later, she docked at Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. On September 13, the barques "Montezuma" and "Gazelle" were also both de-masted by a hurricane near Barbados. No information is available on the hurricane between September 14 to September 16, but on September 17, the barques "Abbyla" and "Elias Pike" encountered the hurricane, roughly 500 miles (800 km) off the coast of North Carolina. Several ships reported encountering hurricane conditions on September 19 off the East Coast of the United States, some as far north as Sable Island. Based on these reports, the track began about 500 miles (800 km) northeast of the Virgin Islands on September 12 and ended on September 20 off the coast of Nova Scotia.
Tropical Storm Four.
On October 5, a tropical storm caused flooding in Saint Lucia. That day and throughout the next, high winds and heavy rain were observed in Speightstown, Barbados. The storm may also have affected Saint Vincent. No track has been identified for the storm and it has been assigned a single location in the HURDAT database.
Hurricane Five.
A modern-day Category 1 hurricane was first seen on October 14 approximately 310 miles (500 km) west of Bermuda. A schooner, "Albert Treat", encountered the storm and was thrown onto its beam ends. The schooner suffered considerable damage and three men drowned. The next day, further north, the barque "Acacia" fell onto its beam ends, but managed to reach safety. Throughout October 16 the hurricane traveled northward, parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The ship "Oder" reported losing its sails in a hurricane off Sable Island that day. The storm became extratropical around midday on October 16 and dissipated completely by October 17.
Tropical Storm Six.
Based on meteorological records kept by an officer of the U.S. steamer "James Adger", a strong tropical storm was centered to the northwest of Aspinwall, Panama from November 22 through to November 25. The storm weakened late on November 24 and began drifting slowly westward on November 25 before dissipating later that day.

Kadoorie Synagogue

The Kadoorie Synagogue, also known Synagogue Kadoorie - Mekor Haim ("Fountain of Life") is the current synagogue of the Jewish Community of Porto. Its construction started in 1929 and was inaugurated in 1938. It is the largest synagogue in the Iberian Peninsula. The synagogue "Kadoorie - Mekor Haim", is located on Guerra Junqueiro Street, in the city of Porto, Portugal.
History.
The synagogue and the Jewish Community of Porto.
The history of Kadoorie synagogue is inextricably linked to the history of its founder, Captain Artur Barros Basto, a Portuguese army officer converted to Judaism.
In the early twenties of the last century there were at least twenty Ashkenazim Jews in the city; since they did not have a synagogue they had to go to Lisbon, for all religious matters. 
After realizing the need for a synagogue, Barros Basto started to plan on building a synagogue but first, on his own initiative, officially registers in the Civil Government the local Jewish community in 1923 and named it Comunidade Israelita do Porto (Israelite Community of Porto).
The present synagogue would only begin to be built years later but the community was organized and rented a house on the Elias Garcia street that started to function as a synagogue.
In 1929, Barros Basto raised funds that enabled him to buy the plot of land for the future synagogue, in Guerra Junqueiro Street. 
In November 13, 1929 an application for obtaining the necessary licensing to begin work was delivered at Câmara Municipal do Porto (Municipal chamber) and a few weeks later the first stone was laid and the construction began. The work progressed slowly until 1933, due to the high costs and the limited funds of its founder and the community, despite all the support that was provided by the Committee for the Spanish-Portuguese Jews of London.
In that year, Laura Kadoorie, the wife of a Jewish philanthropist of Iraqi origin, Sir Elly Kadoorie died, and her children saw in this unfortunate event the necessity to honor their mother, a descendant of Portuguese Jews who fled the country from the Inquisition. This tribute was reflected in the monetary support of the Kadoorie family to the construction of large parts of the Synagogue of Porto, which was renamed "Synagogue Kadoorie - Mekor Haim."
"Kadoorie" in honor of the family that was so important to its conclusion and "Mekor Haim" the name that its founder had given to it.
Architecture.
The building reveals a sturdy façade and a modern architecture visible through its simple and discreet volumetry, which reveals much about the architects who projected it.
The building's interior is beautifully decorated with passages of Torah in Hebrew letters, complemented by Moroccan-Sephardic decorations.
According to documents filed in the Town Hall, when the application for the building permit was submitted, it was given to Lieutenant Augusto dos Santos Malta, an architect trained in the School of Fine Arts of Porto. It is also known that some of these documents were signed by the architect Arthur de Almeida Jr. suggesting that both may have been co-authors of the project.
The Master Rogério de Azevedo, may also have had direct involvement in the work but either only at (its) the end of the construction or even during the finishes since some parts of the building, including the library woodwork, are very similar to other significant works of Rogério de Azevedo.
Present Day.
Currently, the community is guided by the philosophy of Chabad Lubavitch and counts among its members, with Jews of various origins such as Poland, Egypt, the United States, India, Russia, Israel, Spain, Portugal and England.
In the present day, rabbi Daniel Litvak guides the community, he's a native of Argentina. The current vice president of the Jewish Community of Porto is the granddaughter of Captain Barros Basto, Isabel Ferreira Lopes.

Lord Colvill

Lord Colvill (or Baron (de) Colville) was a title of nobility in the Peerage of England. The family rose through the Anglo-Norman aristocracy, holding lands in Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire, perhaps most notable being Weston in Cambridgeshire, subsequently called Weston-Colville. Walter de Colville of Castle Bytham in Lincolnshire was summoned in 1264 to a Parliament convened on behalf of Henry III of England by Simon de Montfort, who held the king captive. By later usage, this act is held to have ennobled the family as parliamentary barons, creating the title. Walter was captured by Prince Edward later that year and was forced to redeem his confiscated lands. The next two generations of the family were excluded from parliamentary summons and they were not again called until 1341/2, although the recipient, Robert de Colville, a great-grandson of Walter, had been attending Parliament as an unsummoned lord as early as 1331. The title fell into abeyance on the death of his son Robert at the age of 6 in 1370, his heirs being the descendants of two sisters of his great-grandfather, granddaughters of the Walter first summoned.

<doc id="36698787" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36698787" title="VCE (company)">
VCE (company)

VCE, the Virtual Computing Environment Company, is a privately held American computer integration company formed in 2011 by Cisco Systems and EMC Corporation with additional investments from VMware and Intel Corporation. It was founded (originally named Acadia) in 2009 as a joint venture between Cisco Systems and EMC Corporation with additional investments from VMware and Intel Corporation.
VCE builds and assembles Vblock Systems using EMC storage, Cisco servers and networking, and VMware virtualization technology. It bundles and tests these systems before shipping them to customers.
History.
Cisco Systems, EMC Corporation and VMware (partially owned by EMC) unveiled a joint partnership in November 2009 to develop cloud computing platforms called Vblock Infrastructure Packages.
The partnership was originally called the VMware-Cisco-EMC alliance, though the name was later shortened to VCE, for the “Virtual Computing Environment coalition”.
At the same EMC World trade show, Cisco and EMC introduced a joint venture named Acadia. The goal of Acadia, originally set up as a separate legal entity, was to build Vblock Infrastructure Packages in a standardized and repeatable fashion for customer data centers.
Michael Capellas, who also was a board member of Cisco, was named chairman of Acadia, and its first chief executive officer (CEO) in May 2010. Praveen Akkiraju is VCE's current CEO.
Sales initially encountered some confusion among customers (which often had different staffs for storage and networking, for example), and different fiscal quarter sales cycles.
By the end of 2010, Capellas told analysts the venture had 65 customers, with an average system costing about $2.5 million.
Acadia and the Virtual Computing Environment coalition combined into a single entity in January 2011, called VCE, the Virtual Computing Environment Company.
Originally located in Silicon Valley and Dallas, Texas, an expansion was announced in March 2011 to Richardson, Texas with an investment from the Texas Enterprise Fund.
In October 2011, another office opened in Marlboro, Massachusetts.
In July 2012, Cisco executive Praveen Akkiraju was appointed CEO and Frank Hauck as president.
It was estimated VCE had 1200 employees at the time, with undisclosed revenues but accumulated losses.
Publicized customers included Babson College and the Mississippi Community College Board.
The press debated if the venture should be considered a "startup company", with one headline joking "VCE = virtual cash erosion" and questioning millions of dollars of executive compensation.
Others considered the arrangement to be a wise investment.
Through 2012, there was a mixture of some success (with speculation of layoffs), and continued confusion due to products from competing partners such as NetApp FlexPod and Xsigo Systems.
Cisco had announced its own "framework" called CloudVerse in late 2011 that was not specific to VMware.
In August 2012, EMC announced a VSPEX reference architecture and partnership with Lenovo and other distributors that was seen as competing with a lower-cost option.
In a November 2012 report by Gartner, VCE had a 57.4% share of integrated infrastructure systems in the second quarter of 2012 based on revenue.
Gartner had previously tracked server, networking, and external controller-based storage as individual markets.
VCE was named one of the “2013 Virtualization 50” by "CRN Magazine".
In May 2013, VCE estimated a $1 billion annual sales rate with more than 1,000 Vblock Systems sold.
However, in US Securities and Exchange Commission filings, EMC accounted for a cumulative loss of over $430 million by September 2012, and Cisco a loss of $457 million by early 2013, since revenues are recorded to the owning companies, not VCE itself.
EMC reported an investment of $667.2 million in cash and $13.2 million in stock-based compensation to VCE, for a stake of about 58%.
Cisco reported a gross investment of $457 million, for a stake of about 35%.
By 2013, some of the same press writers that initially criticized VCE came to view the structure of VCE as being good business for investors. Other press highlighted VCE as a source of innovation and financial performance for investors. Total VCE for 2013 has been reported at over $1B with over a 50% year-over-year growth rate.
There is concern that a fracture in the alliance will continue to create tension among the Cisco, EMC, VMWare, and VCE sales force that will result lost sales to competitors as customers look for a drama free buying experience. 
Products and services.
VCE sells products it calls Vblock Systems as converged infrastructure that combine VMware vSphere software running on Cisco Unified Computing Systems (UCS) connected with Cisco Nexus switches, attached to EMC Symmetrix storage. Despite the "block" in the name, the storage can be accessed as either a block device or a file server.
Vblock Systems are marketed for large-scale data centers which run software applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SharePoint or SAP ERP.
They are delivered in standard 19-inch rack units to aid in planning for cooling and power requirements.
Original systems.
In 2009, the Virtual Computing Environment coalition announced three models of Vblock Infrastructure Packages. 
Vblock 2, intended for high-end data centers, was designed to support 3,000 to 6,000 virtual machines using Cisco UCS, Cisco Nexus 1000v and multilayer directional switches (MDS), as well as EMC Symmetrix VMAX storage and VMware vSphere software.
Vblock 1, intended for the midmarket, was designed for 800 to 3,000 virtual machines and had had a similar configuration to the Vblock 2, but with EMC Clariion storage rather than EMC Symmetrix VMAX.
Vblock 0, the intended low-end configuration, was projected for release in 2010 to support 300 to 800 virtual machines and use a similar configuration, but with EMC Celerrastorage.
The term "infrastructure package" was later changed to "infrastructure platform" and then just "Vblock System".
Enterprise-level systems.
In May 2011, the Vblock System Series 300 was announced with models EX, FX, GX and HX (smallest to largest). The Vblock 2 was renamed the 700 series.
The Vblock System 700 LX was announced at the EMC World May 2012 trade show, as the most expensive Vblock System, supporting thousands of virtual machines. VCE introduced the inclusion of EMC software for backup, recovery, replication, business continuity and data mobility for virtualized environments. Applications included EMC Avamar, EMC Data Domain, and EMC RecoverPoint. The Vblock System 700 included EMC VPLEX workload mobility and business continuity software, as well as support for new features in EMC Unified Infrastructure Manager, improved VMware integration, and centralized monitoring of multiple Vblock Systems.
In February 2013, VCE announced Vblock 300 and Vblock 700 models with increased performance and data throughput, using upgraded server and storage components.
Midmarket and entry level systems.
In 2013 VCE announced products for the midrange and remote branch office market. 
These models included the Vblock System 100 and Vblock System 200.
The Vblock 100 was designed to host up to 200 virtual machines in a 24U or 42U rack mount space with up to eight Cisco C220 M3 blade servers, two Cisco Catalyst 3750-X switches and up to 8 TB of storage capacity on an EMC VNXe3150 or VNXe3300 array. The Vblock 200 comes configured with up to 12 Cisco servers, two Nexus 5548UP unified Ethernet and SAN switches, a Cisco Catalyst 3750 management switch, and up to 105 hard drives via the included VNX 5300 array.
Specialized systems.
VCE introduced a specialized system for SAP HANA in February 2013. It combined a Vblock System with SAP HANA in-memory computing and database application software. Later in September 2013 VCE introduced specialized system for high performance database for Oracle as well as extreme applications for both VMware and Citrix VDI environments.
Software.
Desktop virtualization management software that uses VMware View called FastPath was announced in August 2011, and upgraded in June 2012.
In February 2013, VCE announced the management software application Vision Intelligent Operations Software.
VCE Vision software that enables a single management pane for the components in the Vblock Systems it manages via plugins for third party management, automation, and orchestration tools from VMware, Cisco, BMC, CA, and others via RESTful API, SNMP, and unified logging. 
Services.
VCE provides services through partners to plan, design, and deploy Vblock Systems.

Myint Aye

Myint Aye (born 1950) is a Burmese democracy activist. In 2002, he co-founded the Human Rights Defenders and Promoters network in Burma. After several imprisonments on charges related to his activism, on 29 November 2008, he was given a life sentence for allegedly planning a bomb attack in Yangon's Shwepyitha Township. Amnesty International described the evidence against him as "fabricated" and designated him a prisoner of conscience. He was released from prison on 19 November 2012, as a gesture of goodwill before a visit by US President Barack Obama.
Background.
Myint Aye is an alumnus of the University of Foreign Languages, Yangon. While there in 1989, he married Daw La La Win.
Democracy activism.
Myint Aye has been arrested at least seven times, in 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2007. In 2002, Myint Aye co-founded the Human Rights Defenders and Promoters (HRDP) network in Burma. He was also active with the opposition party of Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy, serving as its Yangon vice chairman. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, he was dismissed from the NLD in 2005 "for not following the party principles", but remained active with the HRDP.
Myint Aye was arrested in 2006 for calling for the release of leaders of the 88 Generation Students Group, but was released within weeks; he attributes the swift release to international pressure from groups like Amnesty and Front Line.
2008 life sentence.
Myint Aye was active in bringing aid to Cyclone Nargis survivors in 2008. He was arrested on 8 August following a search of his home; police reportedly removed him from his father-in-law's home with a black hood over his head. Initially charged with "misappropriating relief funds", Myint Aye was later charged with participating in a bomb attack the previous month in Shwepyitha Township. Activists alleged he was tortured while in detention, and Amnesty stated that his trial "fell far short of international fair trial standards". On 29 November 2008, he was sentenced to "life imprisonment plus eight years", which he is serving in Loikaw prison. 
Myint Aye's sentence was protested by several international human rights organizations. The member organizations of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange called the sentencings of Myint Aye, Zarganar, and others a "historical low point" in Burmese free expression and "a clear message that the junta will not tolerate opposition in the lead-up to their alleged 'democratic' 2010 elections." Front Line stated after his arrest that he appeared to be "targeted as a result of his human rights activities, in particular his work to uphold democracy". Amnesty named him a prisoner of conscience and in August 2012, selected his case to highlight at the annual Edinburgh Festival.
Release.
On 19 November 2012, U Myint Aye was released just ahead of a visit by US President Barack Obama. Reuters described the move as "clearly timed to show goodwill."

Bocage's African fat mouse

Bocage's African Fat Mouse ("Steatomys bocagei") is an extant species of rodent indigenous to Angola, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Given the distribution of the species across the Angolan Plateau and south-west of the DRC throughout central Africa, the probability of a 'large population', and the security of its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognises "S. bocagei" as stable. Whereas taxonomies early in the twentieth century posit "S. bocagei" as a species, more contemporary records from 1977 onwards identify it as indistinguishable from "S. pratensis". In 1998, however, Crawford-Cabral proposed that the additional pair of teats in "S. bocagei" required separation from "S. pratensis". Subsequent to Crawford-Cabral's publication, Wilson and Reader maintain in "Mammal Species of the World" that the size of these species also requires differentiation, where "S. bocagei" is significantly larger than "S. pratensis" and is unique or otherwise corresponds to "S. opimus".

Feel Again

"Feel Again" is a song recorded by American rock band OneRepublic for their third studio album "Native" (2013). It was written and produced by Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Drew Brown and Noel Zancanella. It is an alternative and uplifting rock song, featuring big drums, rowling guitars and hand-clapping beats.
"Feel Again" talks about coming back into your own and embracing life, as well as, transforming from "a lonely soul" to a man who is able to love again. It received positive reviews from music critics, who called it "wonderfully catchy" and that it would make a brilliant sing-along at larger festivals. Some critics compared the song to Florence + the Machine's "Dog Days Are Over". The song was mildly successful in North America, peaking at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100; however, it saw most of its success in Europe, particularly Germany where it peaked at number 9 on the Media Control Charts.
A portion of the proceeds from the sales of the single will be donated to Save the Children's Every Beat Matters campaign to support training frontline health workers around the world.
Release.
"Feel Again" was unveiled on ABC's "Good Morning America", on August 10, 2012, and on August 22 the group released an audio stream for everyone to listen the track. The single was also delivered to radio on August 22, and the song was released to iTunes on August 27, 2012. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of the single will be donated to Save the Children's Every Beat Matters campaign to support training frontline health workers around the world. The song was also heavily featured in the trailers for the 2013 film "The Spectacular Now".
Writing and inspiration.
"Feel Again" was written by Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Drew Brown and Noel Zancanella, while production was handled by Tedder. Tedder revealed that last year he was inspired by gospel melodies and harmonies. "The song itself was kind of a departure for anything we've ever done before on every level," frontman Ryan Tedder said. "It's very much an uptempo song and has a lot of gospel influence in it." "For whatever reason that's something that was resonating with me and I felt that I really wanted to shift as many of our songs into that vibe as possible," he said.
Tedder said their partnership with Save the Children was serendipitous and it actually helped him finish the lyrics to the song.
"Initially we just had the beginning of a song. Save the Children came along and it coincided with another thought that we had as a band which was on this album to really focus on doing stuff that actually served a greater purpose other than just putting out another song. The process of trying to get hits or constantly keep up with the Joneses, after a certain point it's like, 'Wait. Why are we doing this?'. The Save the Children program added a serious amount of gravity to what we were doing and the amount of kids that we would be helping with donating proceeds from the sale of the single. It also helped me finish the lyrics. I actually had some kind of direction and weight." 
Composition.
"Feel Again" is an up-tempo song, featuring an uplifting, hook-laden melody filled with hope and optimism. It showcases a richer, fuller sound palette that accentuates the anthemic qualities of their songwriting with big drums, rowling guitars and tightly produced vocal harmonies. The uplifting, emotional song contains similar catchy melodies to their past work, such as "Good Life", "Stop and Stare", "Apologize" and "All the Right Moves". Bill Lamb of About.com expressed his opinion, commenting: "That swaying, percussion laced singalong chorus is straight out of church. The backing chords as the song closes even feel a bit like a church organ. The big booming drum sounds and atmospheric keyboard chords give the mix a massive feel."
The song's emotional pull is given a massive boost by its powerful lyrics about coming back into your own and embracing life. "Heart still beating but it's not working. I reach out trying to love but I feel nothing," Tedder aches before bursting into the melodic chorus that is filled with bliss, "But with you I feel again." The hand-clap song is ultimately a tale about grabbing life by the horns and feeling new again no matter what happened the day prior. In the chorus, Tedder sings about transforming from "a lonely soul" to a man who is able to love again; "I'm feeling better since you know me/I was a lonely soul but that's the old me."
Critical reception.
The song received a favorable reception from music critics. Arjan Writers gave a very positive review for the track, stating that "Feel Again represents everything fans have come to love about the group, it clearly demonstrates that the group is evolving their brand of pop." The review further added: "In world saturated by bleak news headlines, conveying a message of living life in the moment is a timeless concept that truly has a universal appeal. And leave it up to Tedder and his friends to package such a powerful sentiment in a tightly-produced and radio-ready package that has the potential to spread like wildfire." Sam Wilbur of AOL Radio followed the same thought, writing, "The single is destined to be a top radio hit and a live favorite, with its hand-clapping beats and enjoyable chorus." Huw Hopkins of Alt Sounds commented, "The main chorus melody is wonderfully catchy and would make a brilliant sing-along at larger festivals. There is a certain soul to the voice of Ryan Tedder, but the production skills and teamwork of Zach Filkins adds an extra kick on the choral backing vocals."
Some critics realized that the track is very similar to Florence + the Machine songs. Scott Shetler of Pop Crush gave the song 3 out of 5 stars, writing that "With its urgent hand-clapping and swelling vocal hooks, 'Feel Again' sounds so similar to 'Dog Days Are Over' that the band might as well add a 'Featuring Florence + the Machine' credit." Shetler also said that "Though 'Feel Again' is far from original, the optimistic message and those 'woo-ooh-ooh' chants are hard to resist." Christina Lee of Idolator also noticed a Florence and the Machine influence, writing "Perhaps it's the handclaps. Perhaps it's the booming drums. Perhaps it's Ryan Tedder's hopeful tone, or the way his voice builds, collapses and then surges again without ever sounding defeated. Regardless, OneRepublic's new single, reminds us a lot of Florence + The Machine's breakout single 'Dog Days Are Over'. And that's not a bad thing." Bill Lamb of About.com agreed with both, adding that "There is also an echo of the feel of The Killers' song 'All These Things That I've Done'." Lamb also commented, "What the song seems to lack in originality it makes up for in feeling sharp, fresh, and celebratory.
Music video.
The music video was filmed in a redwood forest near San Francisco, California from July 31, 2012 to August 2, 2012. It premiered on Vevo on August 28, 2012. The video begins with Ryan Tedder walking over leafy ground in front of a beautiful sunset in the San Francisco Bay area. He stoops to pick up a glowing yellow ball. He then sees what appears to be a string of yellow lights. There is a shot of Ryan following the lights, then the video cuts to alternating shots of the band with strings of lights in the background, and different people dancing to the music. He is shown with the yellow ball in his heart, glowing through his clothes, and suggesting he had lost his heart or it had been broken, and he had regained it. The video cuts with an aerial view of the forest, and the sun rising.
Carl Williot of Idolator wrote a positive review, commenting, "The hypercolor lights complement the effervescence and effortlessness of Tedder's voice, and the total package is bright, it's colorful, it's earthy. Like a delicious music video salad." Amy Sciarretto of Pop Crush commented: "'Feel Again' won't wow you with spectacular graphics but it what it will do is allow you to concentrate on the song, which is slated to appear on the band's upcoming third studio album. Perhaps that was OneRepublic's intention by selecting this no frills treatment for the first visual taste of their next record. It was an effective strategy since it reeled us in hook, line and sinker."

Attalea phalerata

Attalea phalerata is a species of palm tree known by the English common name urucuri palm, the Portuguese common name urucurizeiro, and the Spanish common name shapaja. Other common names include motacu and bacuri. It is native to Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru, where it grows along southern and western Amazonia. It is the most common palm tree on the Pantanal.
This palm grows up to 18 meters tall. It begins to reproduce at one meter tall, at an age of 7 to 10 years. It produces flowers throughout the year and fruits twice per year. It grows in many types of forests.
This tree is of ecological importance. The seeds are dispersed by tapirs, which swallow the fruits whole, and by Rheas, agoutis, spiny rats of genus "Clyomys", and Caracaras. The Hyacinth Macaw consumes the seeds and may disperse them, as well. The sheaths of the palm often accumulate the seeds of other plants, which are sometimes deposited there by "Artibeus jamaicensis", a frugivorous bat. The seeds sometimes germinate there and grow as epiphytes on the palm tree. This palm tree is commonly pollinated by sap beetles of genus "Mystrops" and weevils of tribe Madarini. The weevil "Pachymerus cardo" is known to be a seed predator on this species.
The tree has human uses. The leaves are used to thatch rooftops and the fruits are fed to pigs and other livestock. It is a source of vegetable oil. This is "economically the most important palm species in Bolivia".
"Rhodinus stali", an insect which is a vector of Chagas disease, may infest this tree.

Blood of the Condor

Blood of the Condor (, ) is a 1969 Bolivian film by director Jorge Sanjinés. The film tells the story of an indigenous Bolivian community receiving medical care from the Peace Corps-like American agency "Cuerpo del Progreso" ("Progress Corps") which is secretly sterilising local women. The Bolivians attack the foreigners, and the attackers are rounded up and shot by the authorities. The brother of the shot protagonist desperately seeks medical care for his brother, but due to lack of money for proper care his brother dies.
Impact.
Sanjinés' "Yawar Mallku" is thought to have led to the expulsion of the Peace Corps from Bolivia in an act of anti-imperialist cultural nationalism by the indigenous people.
After showings of "Yawar Mallku", Sanjinés learned that many peasants had criticism about the difficulty of his films due to the use of flashback for narration, as his film-making was greatly influenced by European art cinema, and about the lack of attention to denouncing the causes of the indigenous peoples' issues. He took this into account when making his next film, called "El coraje del pueblo" ("The Courage of the People"), in 1971.

Queensway Quay Marina, Gibraltar

The Queensway Quay Marina is one of three marinas in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. The yachting facility is located at the eastern aspect of the middle section of Gibraltar Harbour. It is the site of what may be the oldest wharf in Gibraltar, Ragged Staff Wharf.
Infrastructure.
Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, has three marinas. These include Marina Bay, Ocean Village Marina, and Queensway Quay Marina. While the first two are positioned just north of Gibraltar Harbour, between the North Mole and the airport runway, Queensway Quay Marina is located within the middle section of the harbour. The marina is east of the south entrance to the harbour and south of Coaling Island. The most southern of the three marinas has the advantage of being further from Gibraltar International Airport and its attendant noise and fuel odors.
Visitors to Queensway Quay Marina enter Gibraltar Harbour through the south entrance, between the South Mole and the Detached Mole. They stop at the south pontoon (floating dock) to be assigned a berth, and are customarily berthed on the most southern of the pontoons. A coded security system controls access to the pontoons. Gibraltar's Yacht Reporting Berth closed in late 2005 and customs clearance of vessels is now handled by each marina.
The marina has 185 berths, including facilities for up to eight 30 metre and two 40 metre vessels. In addition, it has a 75 metre berth, although its ability to accommodate a larger vessel is dependent upon the boat's draft (or draught). Metered water and electricity are available at all berths, and some berths have access to cable television and telephone. The marina also has shower and toilet facilities, as well as access to ice and laundry service. In addition, Queensway Quay Marina has a variety of restaurants, bars, and shops.
History.
Ragged Staff Wharf is the quayside of Queensway Quay Marina. It is thought to be the oldest wharf in Gibraltar. While initially built by the Spanish, the wharf was further developed by the British in 1736. First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Charles Wager supervised the improvements at Ragged Staff Wharf, with the goal of providing "better victualling of men-at-war." While there are a number of theories for the derivation of the name of the wharf, none have been proven. One theory is that it originates from the nautical term for the stump mast utilised as a hoist on the vessels that transferred barrels of water to ships at the quay. The wharf was also the site where Governors of Gibraltar would customarily arrive. The steps at that landing place were referred to as Governor's Landing, and are still utilised at the wharf.
Queensway Quay Marina was a Taylor Woodrow development of a former Ministry of Defence site. Construction of phase one of the project, the Queensway Quay residences, just north of the naval docks, started in December 1990 and the marina opened between 1992 and 1994. The first three residential complexes were, in order, Queensway Quay, Cormorant Wharf, and Ordnance Wharf, the last on a historic wharf which is the southern boundary of the marina. In 2000, the marina changed ownership; later, it was enlarged by the construction of The Island, a 13,000 square metre breakwater on reclaimed land opposite Queensway Quay. Nineteen townhouses were built on the breakwater, each with its own swimming pool and 20 metre yacht mooring. The Sails is the most recent development at Queensway Quay Marina. Paul Butler, director of Marina Properties Limited, has been the owner of Queensway Quay Marina since 2000.

Boletus innixus is a species of bolete fungus in the Boletaceae family. Found in eastern North America, it was first described scientifically by Charles Christopher Frost in 1874, from collections made in New England. An edible mushroom, the convex cap grows to wide and is dull reddish brown to yellow brown. The stem is long by thick, but often swollen at the apex with a tapered base. It has a bright yellow pore surface when young that dulls in color when mature. There are about 1 to 3 pores per mm when young, but they expand as they mature to about 2 mm wide. The spore print is olive-brown, and the spores are ellipsoid, smooth, and measure 8–11 by 3–5 um.
The mushroom is often confused with the similar "Boletus auriporus", which has a pinkish cinnamon to dark reddish brown cap.

You've Been Trumped

"You've Been Trumped" is a 2011 documentary by British filmmaker Anthony Baxter. The film documents the construction of a luxury golf course on a beach in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland by Real Estate Tycoon Donald Trump, and the subsequent struggles between the locals and Donald Trump and Scottish legal and governmental authorities. The film was briefly ranked as the highest rated British film of all time on the Internet Movie Database. The film used scenes from the movie "Local Hero."
When it was announced that the documentary was to be given its British television premiere on BBC Two on 21 October 2012, Trump's lawyers contacted the corporation to demand that the film should not be shown, claiming that it is defamatory and misleading. The screening went ahead, the BBC defending the decision and pointing out that Trump had refused the opportunity to take part in the film.
Reception.
ReelScotland reviewed the film, concluding "an emotive film which shows both what can happen when a Government considers money over its own laws and how those at the sharp end remain resilient throughout".
Bill Forsyth, the director of "Local Hero" (from which the film used footage), reacted to the film positively. He saw the film at the Shetland Film Festival.

OProfile

OProfile is a system-wide statistical profiling tool for Linux. It was written by John Levon in 2001 for Linux kernel version 2.4 after his M.Sc. project, and consists of a kernel module, a user-space daemon and several user-space tools.
OProfile is capable of profiling an entire system or its parts, from interrupt routines or drivers, to user-space processes. It has low overhead.
The most portable mode of oprofile uses a system timer to generate sampling interrupts (events). A less portable mode allows hardware performance counters to be used for sampling events generationed on several processor architectures. In Linux 2.2/2.4 only 32-bit x86 and IA64 are supported; in Linux 2.6 there is wider support: x86 (32 and 64 bit), DEC Alpha, MIPS, ARM, sparc64, ppc64, AVR32.
Call graphs are supported only on x86 and ARM.
In 2012 it was recognized by IBM's engineers as one of two most commonly used performance counter monitor profiling tools on Linux; the other was perf tool.

Congressional Prayer Room

The Congressional Prayer Room near the rotunda in the United States Capitol is a place set aside for the use of members of Congress who seek a quiet place for meditation or prayer. The space is not open to tour groups or visitors to the Capitol.
History.
The prayer room was established by Concurrent Resolution number 60 for the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives, passed in 1954, and officially opened in 1955. 
The Concurrent Resolution included the following text: 
"Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That the Architect of the Capitol is hereby authorized and directed to make available a room, with facilities for prayer and meditation, for the use of Members of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Architect shall maintain the Prayer Room for individual use rather than assemblies and he shall provide appropriate symbols of religious unity and freedom of worship."
Congressional involvement.
The official Congressional brochure describing the development of the Prayer Room credits a number of specific Congressional members with its establishment:
"Representative Brooks Hays of Arkansas introduced House Concurrent Resolution 60, Eighty-third Congress, in the House February 12, 1953, directing the setting apart of a place for this purpose. Senator Monroney of Oklahoma introduced a companion resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 14, Eighty-third Congress, in the Senate, February 13, 1953. House Concurrent Resolution 60 was passed by the House, July 17, 1953, and by the Senate May 4, 1954. Following passage of this resolution by the House, the Honorable Joseph W. Martin, Jr., Speaker of the House of Representatives, made available an appropriate room on the House Side of the Capitol near the Rotunda and shortly after passage of the resolution by the Senate, named a special committee to arrange for the design and equipment of the Prayer Room. This Committee consisted of Representatives LeCompte of Iowa and St. George of New York, with Representative Hays as Chairman."
Design.
An interfaith or non-partisan design was integral to the vision of the prayer room so that it could be used by any Senator or Representative regardless of his or her faith. To that end, an interfaith advisory committee was established, including the Chaplain of the Senate, the Chaplain of the House of Representatives, and since they were both Protestant, two additional members representing the Roman Catholic and Jewish faiths.
The room includes a stained glass window of George Washington kneeling in prayer, with the words from Psalm 16:1, "Preserve me, O God, for in thee do I put my trust," and the words President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address, “This Nation Under God”.
The designers of the Prayer Room felt that the image of Washington was particularly appropriate, given his words from his first inaugural address:
"...it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States, a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge."
In addition to an open Bible, the simple furnishings include two prayer benches, six chairs, two candles, plants, and an American flag. The Congressional brochure notes the importance of both the symbolism and the color schemes employed in the Prayer Room:
"On the altar, two vases constantly filled with fresh flowers tell of the beauty of God's world. At the right and left are two candelabra, each with the traditional seven lights. An American flag is at the right of the altar. In front of each candelabrum is a plain prie-dieu or prayer bench, at which those who desire to do so may kneel. There are ten chairs facing the central window. The walls are pastel blue. The ceiling is the original painting, with cloud panels trimmed with gold. The rug is deep blue. The altar and prayer benches are of white oak. When illumined by the indirect lights of the shielded wall brackets, the room is a soft color harmony of blue and gold. Neither large enough for nor designed for a religious assembly, it is adequate for its avowed purpose --- a shrine at which the individual may renew his faith in his God and his loyalty to his country."
Room 219.
In 2005, a group of congressional members began looking for a room in the Capitol large enough for voluntary group prayer, ultimately receiving permission to use Room 219. Although many individuals and small groups use Room 219, the original group now tries to meet weekly and calls itself the "Congressional Prayer Caucus."
Prayers and Congressional sessions.
In addition to spaces set aside for private or group prayer, the inclusion of a prayer before the opening of each session of both the House and the Senate traces its origins back to the days of the Continental Congress, and the official recommendation of Benjamin Franklin, June 28, 1787:
“I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, 
the more convincing proofs I see of this truth: 
that God Governs in the affairs of men. And if a 
sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, 
is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? 
We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings, 
that ‘except the Lord build the House they labour 
in vain that build it.’ I firmly believe this; and I also 
believe that without his concurring aid we shall 
succeed in this political building no better, than the 
Builders of Babel . . . I therefore beg leave to move—
that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance 
of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, 
be held in this Assembly every morning before 
we proceed to business, and that one or more 
of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate 
in that Service.”
Past religious usage.
In its early days, the Capitol building was actually used for religious services in addition to governmental functions, with Sunday church services regularly held until after the Civil War. According to the US Library of Congress exhibit "Religion and the Founding of the American Republic" "It is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) and of James Madison (1809-1817) the state became a church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.)"

Menachem Cohen (scholar)

Menachem Cohen (born c. 1928) is an Israeli scholar who worked for over 30 years to correct grammatical errors in the Hebrew Bible. The last attempt at this was in 1525, by Jacob Ben-Hayim. Cohen's work demonstrates the extent to which Judaism venerates every tiny biblical calligraphic notation, to ensure that worldwide communities use exactly the same version of the Old Testament.
Background.
According to Jewish law, a Torah is invalid for public reading if even a single letter is incorrect or misplaced, for Jewish law considers each letter as indispensable.
In 1525, in Venice, Jacob Ben-Hayim, editor of the second edition of the Mikraot Gedolot, took it upon himself to fix grammatical errors in the Hebrew Bible. Ben-Hayim's version unified Judaism's varying texts and commentaries on the Bible under one umbrella, and it is this version that has remained the standard version used by generations to this day. However, Ben-Hayim had to rely on inferior manuscripts and commentaries, which caused numerous inaccuracies to appear in his version, and these were only magnified in subsequent editions.
Mission.
In 2012, 84-year-old Israeli Judaic scholar Menachem Cohen of the Bible department at Bar-Ilan University finished a 30-year mission to fix all known textual errors in the Hebrew Bible to produce a "truly definitive edition of the Old Testament."
Cohen's edits focused mainly on grammatical errors, such as fixing the accent of a vowel, the letter in a word, or fixing biblical symbols used for accentuation and cantillation ("te'amim") which were copied down incorrectly centuries ago. Cohen used thousands of medieval manuscripts to identify approximately 1,500 inaccuracies in the Hebrew Bible, which he corrected in a 21-volume set. The errors that Cohen found do not alter the meaning of the Bible or have any bearing on its stories. Most errors were not found in the Torah (or Five Books of Moses), which does not include vowel markings or cantillation notations, but rather in the final two-thirds of the Tanakh. Cohen also included the most comprehensive commentaries available, most notably that of Rashi.
Cohen primarily relied on the Aleppo Codex, a thousand-year-old text considered to be the most accurate copy of the Bible. In 1947, a Syrian mob burned the synagogue that was protecting the Codex, and the Codex briefly disappeared before most of it was smuggled out into Israel a decade later.
Cohen has not called for any changes in how traditional Torah scrolls are written, as this would likely result in a "firestorm of objection and criticism," but rather aimed for accuracy in versions used by Hebrew readers for studying. 
Cohen said:
The people of Israel took upon themselves, at least in theory, one version of the Bible, down to its last letter...
It was amazing to me that for 500 years, people didn't sense the errors.They just assumed that everything was fine, but in practice everything was not fine...
I want the Bible to be user-friendly. Today, we can create sources of information and searches that allow you to get an answer to everything you are wondering...
Cohen also stressed that unity and accuracy in the Hebrew Bible were important in order to distinguish the sacred Jewish text from those used by break-away sects, such as the Christians and Samaritans.
In addition, Cohen launched a digital version, with the help of his son Shmuel, a computer programmer, which he hopes will become a benchmark of the Israeli education system.

<doc id="36699522" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36699522" title="Justification from eternity">
Justification from eternity

Justification from eternity is a concept within Protestant theology asserting that the justification of a believer takes place at least partially in eternity past.
Justification from eternity is not part of mainstream Protestant theology, and is explicitly rejected by the Westminster Confession of Faith, which asserts,
God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit does, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them.
Reformed orthodox theologians taught that justification is part of an order of salvation, and that it follows effectual calling and a person actually believing. Francis Turretin in his "Institutes of Elenctic Theology" speaks of some who teach instead that justification was actually executed eternally. He agrees that justification was decreed eternally, but counters that actual execution occurs during people's lives. Justification from eternity is the teaching that justification itself is eternal rather than temporal, and that it occurs before faith rather than after it.
Justification from eternity has been described as a "chief tenet of Antinomian Hyper-Calvinism," Early antinomians John Eaton and John Saltmarsh taught that justification precedes faith, though they did not specifically teach the doctrine of justification from eternity, and William Twisse taught that at least in some sense justification precedes faith. Justification from eternity seems to have been taught by William Pemble, and it was one of the charges against Anne Hutchinson. Tobias Crisp was one of the most notorious teachers of this view. It was later propounded by John Gill. Referring to Ephesians 1:3-4, Gill argued that "justification is one of those spiritual blessings wherewith the elect are blessed in Christ according to election-grace, before the foundation of the world."
Another exponent of this doctrine was Abraham Kuyper. G. C. Berkouwer notes Kuyper's view came out of a belief that "justification does not originate through faith but that it is only "accepted" in and through faith."
Opponents of the doctrine have countered with the argument that it undermines justification by faith.

Cyclone Nadia

Cyclone Nadia was a powerful tropical cyclone that struck both Madagascar and Mozambique in March 1994. It formed on March 16 and moved westward for the first ten days of its duration. Warm waters and low wind shear allowed for the storm to gradually strengthen. After developing a well-defined eye, Nadia intensified to reach winds of 175 km/h (110 mph 10 minute sustained) early on March 22, according to Météo-France (MF). In contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated winds of about 220 km/h (140 mph 1 minute sustained). On March 23, the cyclone struck northern Madagascar, causing flooding and localized damage where it moved ashore. There were 12 deaths in the country. Nadia emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a weakened storm, although it reintensified slightly before making landfall in northeastern Mozambique on March 24. The storm turned southward through the country, emerging over water on March 26. It turned to the northeast and meandered over waters before dissipating on April 1.
Damage was heaviest in Mozambique, estimated at about $20 million (1994 USD). Cyclone Nadia severely affected four provinces in the country, primarily Nampula Province where it moved ashore. There, 85% of the houses were destroyed, and across its path, the cyclone left 1.5 million people homeless. High winds caused widespread power outages, left areas without water, and significantly damaged crops, notably the cashew crop. The storm struck before the harvest, and lack of food resulted in 300 deaths in the months after the storm. Across Mozambique, Nadia directly caused 240 deaths and injured thousands. Effects spread as far inland as Malawi.
Meteorological history.
A disturbance in the Indian Ocean intertropical convergence zone became evident southeast of the Chagos Archipelago on March 16 after two cyclones moved away from the region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south. On March 17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March 19 allowed for strengthening. On March 19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.
After becoming a tropical storm, Nadia quickly intensified, developing a central dense overcast and later an eye. With minimal wind shear, the storm strengthened into a tropical cyclone early on March 21. That day, the JTWC estimated winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 1-minute sustained), or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, and late on March 21, MF upgraded Nadia into an intense tropical cyclone. While the cyclone was approaching northern Madagascar on March 22, MF estimated Nadia attained maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph 10 minute sustained) early on March 22. At around the same time, the JTWC estimated winds of about 220 km/h (140 mph (1-minute sustained)). While at peak intensity, Nadia had well-defined outflow and an eye no larger than . At about 0100 UTC on March 23, Nadia made landfall on northern Madagascar near Vohemar, having weakened slightly from its peak.
While located over Madagascar, Nadia weakened into a tropical storm due to the mountainous terrain. With warm temperatures, the storm re-intensified slightly after entering the Mozambique Channel, and it passed about south of Mayotte at 1900 UTC on March 23. At 1700 UTC the next day, Nadia made its second landfall on Mozambique, about halfway between Nacala and Moçambique. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC discontinued advisories. Despite moving further inland, Nadia retained a well-organized circulation and convection. The storm turned to the south and re-emerged into the Mozambique Channel late on March 26 near the mouth of the Zambezi River. Nadia gradually re-intensified while curving to the southeast, and it re-intensified into a tropical storm on March 28, the same day the JTWC resumed issuing advisories. The storm strengthened to reach a secondary peak intensity of 85 km/h (50 mph (10 minute sustained), according to MF. After reaching a position about halfway between Mozambique and Madagascar, Nadia turned to the southwest on April 1 and lost its remaining convection. The JTWC and MF discontinued advisories that day, and the circulation dissipated a day later.
Impact and aftermath.
While crossing northern Madagascar, Nadia produced widespread flooding. In Vohemar where it moved ashore, the storm destroyed most public buildings, although local churches provided assistance in the aftermath. Across the region, the storm downed power lines and destroyed more than 540 tonnes (600 tons) of rice. The cyclone killed 12 people and caused about $200,000 damage (1994 USD).
Upon striking Mozambique, Nadia produced heavy rains and strong wind gusts, causing widespread tree damage and flooding. The city of Nampula recorded 126 mm (4.96 in) of rainfall in a 24 hour period. Damage was heaviest in Nampula, Zambezia, Manica, and Sofala provinces. In Nampula Province, Nadia destroyed 85% of the houses and 75% of the crops, mostly cashew trees. The city of Nacala was heavily damaged, with about 170,000 people losing their houses. Many residents evacuated Nacala, and temporary shelters were provided for those who stayed. At the port in Nacala, the local harbor was wrecked and two ships sank; one of the damaged ships spilled oil into the Bay of Nacala. The city lost power and water, and its primary hospital was destroyed. About of power lines were cut between Nampula and Nacala, and widespread road and bridge damage disrupted transportation. In the area along Nadia's path, over 120 schools were damaged destroyed, affecting over 46,864 students. Across the country, roughly 1.5 million people were left homeless. A World Food Programme building in the city was destroyed, wrecking 642 tonnes (708 tons) of stored food. Overall, Nadia killed 240 people in Mozambique and injured thousands. Damage was estimated at $20 million (1994 USD).
Damage from Nadia extended as far inland as Malawi.
After the storm, about 300,000 people in Nampula Province in Mozambique required food and other goods. Officials sent relief to the affected areas, including iron sheeting and medical teams. Due to damage to sanitation facilities, there were outbreaks of diarrhea and cholera in the weeks after the storm. By April 20, most primary roads were cleared, bridge reconstruction had commenced, and power was being restored. Heavy crop damage depleted food supplies, The cyclone struck shortly before the annual harvest, causing heavy crop damage that depleted food supplies. Some residents who evacuated during the country's civil war returned late to assist in harvesting the remaining crops. In the six months after the storm, about 300 people died due to starvation. Many secondary roads remained blocked in the weeks after the storm, forcing relief supplies to be transported by boat. The country appealed to the international community for assistance, and by Mary 6, various international agencies and governments donated about $1.4 million in cash (1994 USD). The French government sent $48,000 worth of medicine, blankets, and food, the United Kingdom sent $373,134 for generators, water tanks, and roofing materials, and the Spanish government sent about $117,000 worth of food and tents. The charity organization Concern Worldwide sent 54,000 sets of clothing to the country. The government of Japan sent 6,000 blankets and 1,800 bars of soap, while the Italian government sent five generators, eight water tanks, and 1,150 agricultural tools. Donated generators assisted in restoring water in Nacala. In June 1994, the World Bank provided $20 million in assistance to the country due to the storm. Cyclone Nadia contributed to fishing exports decreasing by $11 million during the year.

Vitebsk Governorate

Vitebsk Governorate (Витебская губерния, "Vitebskaya guberniya") was an administrative unit (guberniya) of the Russian Empire, with the seat of governorship in Vitebsk. It was established in 1802 by splitting the Byelorussia Governorate and existed until 1924. Today most of the area belongs to Belarus, the northwestern part to Latvia and the northeastern part to Pskov and Smolensk Oblasts of Russia.
History.
In 1772, as a result of the First Partition of Poland, Inflanty Voivodeship and eastern Belarus were transferred to Russia. In order to accommodate these areas, Pskov Governorate was created. It was proven too big to be manageable, and in 1776 it was split into Pskov and Polotsk Governorates. In 1778 Polotsk Governorate was transformed into Polotsk Viceroyalty. In 1793, the Second Partition of Poland followed, which resulted in the expansion of Polotsk Viceroyalty. In 1796, viceroyalties were abolished. In particular, Polotsk and Mogilev Viceroyalties were merged into Byelorussia Governorate. On February 27, 1802 Byelorussia Governorate was split into Vitebsk and Mogilev Governorates.
The governorate consisted of 12 "uyezds" (the administrative centers, which all had the town status, are given in parentheses),
In 1866, Surazhsky Uyezd was abolished and split between Gorodoksky, Velizhsky, and Vitebsky Uyezd.
On 31 December 1917, Dvinsky, Lyutsinsky and Rezhitsky Uyezds, populated mostly by Latvians and known in Latvian as Latgale, were transferred to Governorate of Livonia, becoming a part of the Latvian Soviet autonomy of Iskolat. Following the Latvian War of Independence, in 1920 the area became a part of the Republic of Latvia under the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty. After 1919, the rest of Vitebsk Governorate was a part of Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.
In 1924, Vitebsk Governorate was abolished. Most of it was transferred to Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, which at the time had districts as the first-level administrative division. Three uyezds, Sebezhsky, Nevelsky, and Velizhsky, were transferred to Pskov Governorate.
Governors.
The administration of the governorate was performed by a governor. The governors of Vitebsk Governorate were

Eidu

Eidu (Chinese: 額亦都, 1562-1622) was a Manchu officer and a member of the Niohuru clan.
Early life.
Eidu's grandfather had established a home in a valley of the Yengge ("wild grape") mountain range, which formed the easternmost spur of the Changbai Mountains, in the southeast area of the present day Jilin.
Eidu's parents were murdered in a feud when he was very young, and he escaped only through the protection of a neighbour. At the age of twelve, he took revenge by killing his parents' murderer, after which he fled to the home of an aunt, who was married to the chieftain of the fortress of Giyamuhu. Here he became a close friend of the chieftain's son, Gahasan Hashu, who later married Nurhaci's sister.
Military career.
In 1580, Nurhaci, then twenty-one years old, passed through Giyamuhu and stopped at the chieftain's home. The eighteen-year-old Eidu was so impressed by his qualities of leadership that he attached himself to Nurhaci and remained his close associate for more than forty years.
In 1583, he accompanied Nurhaci and proved himself an able fighter. Four years later he captured the town of Barda, and received from Nurhaci the title of baturu, "conquering hero." After a long and successful career of military achievement, he joined the Bordered Yellow Banner in 1615, and was appointed as one of the five principal dignitaries in government the following year. In 1617 he captured a number of Ming fortresses in company with Anfiyanggu, and in 1619, was at the forefront of the decisive battles waged by Nurhaci against the three armies of Yang Hao. As reward for his services, he was given a sister of Nurhaci as one of his wives.
Eidu's second son, Daki, was brought up in the royal establishment, and married the fifth daughter of Nurhaci. When Daki spoke out against Nurhaci's sons, Eidu put him to death, prompting Nurhaci to call Eidu his most patriotic officer.
Death and legacy.
Eidu died in 1621. In 1634, he was posthumously awarded the rank of a viscount, which was inherited by his sixteenth son, Ebilun. In 1636, his rank was raised to that of duke (non-hereditary). His name was entered in the Imperial Ancestral Temple, his tomb was moved to a location near that of Nurhaci. A stone tablet was erected in front of the tomb in 1654. The rank of viscount was taken from Ebilun in 1637, due to a misdemeanor, but was restored in 1713 and given to his son, Yende. After Yende was made a duke in 1724, the title of viscount was inherited by other branches of Eidu's family.
Eidu had sixteen sons, among whom the most prominent were the youngest, Ebilun, and the eighth, Turgei, who took part in many militarty campaigns during Hong Taiji's reign, and was highly regarded for his bravery. Among the grandsons of Eidu the most notable was Centai, who served as a Grand Secretary in 1651, and was made a viscount while commanding the Manchu forces in Hunan against Ming generals. Many other descendants of Eidu held office throughout the Qing period.

Lyubutsk (Lyubutsk, Lyubutesk, ) was a Russian fortress, located about below the confluence the Oka River with Dugna in the present-day Kaluga Oblast. Its name derives from a rivulet flowing on northern and eastern sides of the city.
Initially Lyubutsk was part of the Principality of Bryansk. In the 14th century, the city was acquired by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The town was mentioned in 1372 when Algirdas of Lithuania and Mikhail of Tver marched against Dmitry Donskoy, Grand Duke of Moscow, who managed to stop the joint army. After a period of stand off, Algirdas and Dmitry reached an agreement and concluded the Treaty of Lyubutsk.
In 1408, Lyubustk became a property of Vladimir the Bold. However, in 1473 was again under the rule of Lithuania. In 1460 Lyubutsk was mentioned as an settlement reached by Akhmat Khan during his attack on Lithuania and Moscow. Finally, the city came under the rule of Moscow after the 1503 truce ending the second Muscovite–Lithuanian War. Tsar Ivan III bequeathed the fortress to his son Andrey of Staritsa. In the 16th century Lyubutsk ceased to be a fortress and became a posad. In 1566 Lyubutsk was mentioned as a mere village.

George C. Prendergast

George C. Prendergast, PhD (born 1961) is an American oncologist and molecular biologist who currently serves as president and CEO of Lankenau Institute for Medical Research (LIMR); CEO of LIMR Development, Inc. and LIMR Chemical Genomics Center; co-leader of the Program in Cancer Cell Biology & Signaling at Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University; and editor-in-chief of "Cancer Research", a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research and the most frequently cited cancer journal in the world.
Education and career.
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1961, Prendergast graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania in 1983 as a Benjamin Franklin Scholar with a BA in biochemistry. He earned an MS in molecular biophysics from Yale University in 1984 and a PhD in Molecular Biology from Princeton University in 1989. In 2008, recognizing his contributions to cancer research, Prendergast was designated one of the 250 most historically influential alumni of Princeton University. After receiving his doctorate, Prendergast continued his research as an American Cancer Society postdoctoral fellow at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at NYU Medical Center.
Prendergast joined the Department of Cancer Research at Merck Research Laboratories as a staff scientist in 1991. In 1993, he returned to academic research at The Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, first as an assistant professor and later as an associate professor and assistant chair of the Tumor Biology Group. While at Wistar, in 1995, Prendergast was designated a Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences.
In 1999, Prendergast left Wistar to become senior director of the Cancer Research Group at DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company. After the sale of DuPont Pharmaceuticals to Bristol-Myers Squibb, Prendergast moved his groups at Wistar and DuPont to Lankenau Institute for Medical Research (LIMR) as a senior investigator in 2002. He was appointed president and CEO of LIMR in 2004, and has implemented new funding mechanisms for research there, emphasizing invention, biotechnology development, and commercialization.
Accomplishments.
Prendergast’s research has contributed to the discovery and study of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in cancer, and more recently to understanding the role of the immune system in cancer progression and treatment. In the field of cancer genetics, his research helped define how genetic alterations lead to cancer development.
His more recent work has linked cancer genetics and cancer immunology in new ways and advanced the study of how cancer cells erect barriers against the immune system. Through this work, he has developed an approach that works to degrade these barriers and stimulate the immune system in combination with chemotherapy.
Prendergast is the author of 150 peer-reviewed publications and 74 book chapters, editorials, and monographs. He has edited three books: "Molecular Cancer Therapeutics: Strategies for Drug Discovery and Development" (2004) and the first and second editions of "Cancer Immunotherapy: Immune Suppression and Tumor Growth "(2007, 2013). He currently serves as editor-in-chief of "Cancer Research", the most-cited journal in the field.
His work has been cited over 12,000 times. Prendergast holds 17 U.S. patents, with 7 patents pending.

Live 1967 (Red Krayola album)

Live 1967 is a live performance album by the experimental rock band Red Krayola, released on July 28, 1998 through Drag City. The two-disc set comprises the band's performance at the Angry Arts Festival in Los Angeles as well as their sets from various shows at the Berkeley Folk Festival during the summer of 1967. Like all the music played at the festivals it is dedicated to the troops positioned in Vietnam.
Background.
Kurt Von Meier, a University of California art-history professor, became interested in the band after he heard tapes containing "Coconut Hotel", Red Krayola's rejected second album. He was intrigued by the band's experimental and free-form music and invited them to perform at Angry Arts Folk Festival in Berkeley and the Greek Theater in Los Angeles in June and July. Meier also pushed to get the band to play in the Monterey Pop Festival, but was turned down by the festival's organizers.
Performance.
The music played by the Red Krayola during their sets was completely instrumental and consisted of improvised drone and electronic music, comparable to early Velvet Underground. The first disc contains the band's performance at the Angry Arts Festival on June 6, 1967. The Second disc is made up of three separate performances which took place in the evenings between June 27 to July 4. During the festival the band met folk guitarist John Fahey, who accompanied the band onstage for a twenty-three minute improv session on July 3. On the 4th, the announcer mistook the Red Krayola's music for an equipment malfunction and continued to talk several minutes into the band's set.
Reception.
These performances received a lukewarm response from audience and critics alike. Berkeley's underground newspaper, the "Berkeley Barb", dismissed the band as being the "bummer of the festival." Some of audience accused the music of being so abrasive that it was the direct cause of a dog's death during the festival. However, some of the audience appreciated the band's feedback-laden sound, some of whom can be heard chanting "More! More!" at the end of the band's performance on the 4th.
In reviewing the two-disc release, music critic Richie Unterberger noted his admiration of the band's dedication to experimenting in-front of an audience who expected more conventional music. He gave the album two out of five stars, writing: "The Velvet Underground and Pink Floyd, however, rarely stuck with this kind of inaccessible freakiness for more than a few minutes at a time on record, even at their most willfully obscure. This is "all" inaccessible freakiness."

Afrikaner sheep

The Afrikaner sheep is a breed of fat tailed, hair sheep indigenous to South Africa.
History.
Afrikaner sheep are one of the oldest native sheep breeds in South Africa, along with sheep such as the Damara, Blackhead Persian, Pedi, and Zulu (Nguni). Their ancestors were brought down from the middle east by the Khoikhoin people. Ronderib Afrikaners are thought to be the first sheep imported to Australia, with the First Fleet in 1788, but today are very rare in the country.
Varieties.
There are two varieites of Afrikaner sheep; The Namaqua Afrikaner and the Ronderib Afrikaner. Their long, fat tail is an energy store which helps them survive long dry seasons, when fat or lipid breaks down it provides energy and water at the same time; hydrogen is present in all lipids, although hydrogen is not water when not combined to another molecule it automatically grabs two oxygen molecules and becomes H20 water, the rest of the molecules associated with the lipid become energy and combine to form other nutrients.
The Namaqua Afrikaner is known for its hardiness in extreme environmental conditions. It is a slender, lanky sheep with a fat tail, and is not particularly favored for modern lamb production. Namaqua Afrikaners are generally white with a red or black head, and large fat tails. What the breed lacks in market meat desirability, it makes up for in its foraging ability and hardiness in desert conditions.
The Ronderib Afrikaner is one of the larger breeds of South African indigenous sheep. There are two known sub varieties of this breed, one that has soft, fine, shiny hair being the Blinkhaar Ronderib Afrikaner, and the Steekhaar Ronderib Afrikaner having coarse hair, which was thought to be extinct. However, twenty animals were found in 1995 on a farm near Upington. The ribs of both are oval in cross section rather than flat. It is these two characteristics of coat and rib shape which distinguish this distinctive breed. Like the Namaqua Afrikaner (mentioned above) the breed is very adept to desert conditions and is remarkable for the long Seasons it can survive with little or no water. The Ronderib Afrikaners show further characteristics of desert animals in that, similar to the gemsbok, their heels are close together. The aim of the old Ronderib breeders was to develop sheep with shiny coats suitable for making of skin blankets.

Iliesa Delana (born 2 December 1984 in Naisausau, Namara, Tailevu, Fiji) is the first Fijian athlete to win a medal, gold in high jump, for Fiji at the Paralympics. He lost his left leg in a bus accident at age three. He debuted at the FESPIC Games in 2006, and has since won silver medal at the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships, held in New Zealand, and then a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.
2012 Paralympics.
Delana competed in the F42 category (for single leg amputees without prosthesis) at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Going into the games, Delana was ranked number 2 in the world, but jumped 1.74m to win the gold on count back, after clearing all heights up to and including 1.74m on his first attempts. His jump of 1.74m broke the Oceanic record for the event.
In doing this, Delana became the first Fijian to win any medal at the Paralympics (or Olympics), and the first athlete from the South Pacific Islands to win gold (following Francis Kompaon's silver medal for Papua New Guinea in sprinting in 2008).
Delana was congratulated by President Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, and by Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama who called upon all Fijians to celebrate his victory. Upon his return to Fiji, Delana was welcomed by thousands of people (in the rain) for national celebrations which included a procession through the main street of Suva and "military and traditional ceremonies of welcome, only accorded to Heads of States". Delana was invited to inspect a fifty-strong honour guard. President Nailatikau delivered a speech describing Delana as a national "icon", adding that he had brought to the country a "sense of unity and pride [... greatly needed at this point in time and in pursuit towards democratic governance", in the context of constitutional change following the 2006 military coup and plans for the restoration of democracy in 2014. The government announced that it would be building him a new house, to be completed before Christmas, as a gift and "token of appreciation from the Fijian Government and from all Fijians". He was presented with a new home by Prime Minister Bainimarama in January 2013, as "a token of appreciation to convey Fiji's profound gratitude for the great honour had bestowed upon the country".
He is depicted on the obverse of the Fijian 2013 circulating commemorative 50 Cents coin.

Jeff Angell

Jeff Angell (born Jefferson Alan Angell, nicknamed "Junior" and "JdoubleA", on February 13, 1973 in Tacoma, Washington) is an American musician best known for his songwriting, lead vocals and guitar playing in the Seattle, Washington bands Post Stardom Depression, The Missionary Position and Walking Papers.
Recording career.
Post Stardom Depression.
Angell formed Post Stardom Depression with The Lemons bass player Brent Saunders, guitarist Kyong Kim and drummer Joshua Fant. On the strength of their demos and a homemade video for the song "Honeymoon Killer" Post Stardom Depression was signed to Will Records. They recorded "Sexual Uno" and supported its release by touring with Queens of the Stone Age, and the late Dee Dee Ramone. After fulfilling their contract with Will Records, Post Stardom Depression signed with Interscope Records. Shortly afterward, Interscope Records absorbed Geffen Records and A&M records with UMG's acquisition of Polygram. These complicated business matters led the band to sign with The Control Group in 2003. Here they recorded "Ordinary Miracles" with producer Jack Endino. The record became a local favorite on both KEXP and KNDD. Post Stardom Depression toured to South by Southwest and played shows with The Makers, The Black Halos, The Bell Rays, and Nebula in support of the release.
Post Stardom Depression then recorded "Prime Time Looks a Lot Like Amateur Night" with Producer Isaac Carpenter. The record was well received critically and received strong airplay locally. The band did a few short tours but the band members felt they weren't moving forward creatively. They disbanded in 2008 after two sell-out shows at Tacoma's Hell's Kitchen club.
The Missionary Position.
Following the disbandment of Post Stardom Depression, Angell formed The Missionary Position with Benjamin Anderson, an old friend. When Jeff Angell and Benjamin Anderson began playing a Thursday night residency at a club in Seattle, Washington, they hadn't yet settled on a name. Those Thursday lounge nights were billed as The Missionary Position. Angell said "People thought that was the band's name, so, rather than fight it we embraced it" and the band became The Missionary Position.
In 2009 they recorded "Diamonds In A Dead Sky" and released it on the band's label "The Boredom Killing Business". The band supported the release by touring nationally.
The Song "Let's Start A Fire" was used for the Independent Film Channel's promotional campaign for its series Indie Screams.
In 2012, The Missionary Position released "Consequences".
Walking Papers.
In 2012 Angell recorded an album with Barrett Martin (Screaming Trees, Mad Season). The album also features songs with Duff McKagan (Guns & Roses, Velvet Revolver, Loaded), and Pearl Jam's Mike McCready. The new line-up, called Walking Papers, released their eponymous album with Sunyata Records in October 2012.
Other work.
Angell wrote two songs, "Elekt" and "Rock and Roll Teenage Desperation", with the band Loudermilk for their DreamWorks release "The Red Record".

Joachim Kempin (born in 1942) is a German-born businessman and retired Senior Vice President of Microsoft Corporation. He ran Microsoft's division selling operating software to PC manufacturers for 15 years. He is also the author of "Resolve and Fortitude: Microsoft's "Secret Power Broker" Breaks His Silence".
Early career.
In 1972, he joined Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in Munich, Germany as an instructor to teach computer programming classes to customers. He later ran DEC's training center in Munich, and became a marketing manager in DEC's training division headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts. After a short spell at National Semiconductors, he joined Apple’s team in Paris as European marketing manager. He later joined a new software company called Microsoft and accepted a General Manager position for its newly found German subsidiary.
Microsoft.
Upon joining, he moved through the still small company and was promoted to run Microsoft’s division dealing with PC manufacturers. Headquartered near Seattle, Washington, he soon belonged to Microsoft’s executive team and was promoted to Senior Vice President of Microsoft in 1990. In his job he developed relationships with Microsoft’s PC manufacturers and operating software distribution partners worldwide. Journalists called him "Microsoft's Secret Power Broker" and Bill Gates' "Enforcer" who was "wielding Microsoft’s pricing sword". The Department of Justice took an interest in how he ran his portion of Microsoft, and he wound up as a witness to defend the company’s business practices during the 1998-2002 Microsoft antitrust trial. He retired in 2002 from the company and joined several boards as a business advisor, including the National Bureau of Asian Research.
Author.
In January, 2013, Joachim Kempin released a controversial tell-all book about his time in Microsoft. It has received media attention, and Kempin has been outspoken in the press criticizing Microsoft's current leadership. In a Reuters interview with Bill Rigby, Kempin said, "Microsoft's board is a lame duck board, has been forever. They hire people to help them administer the company, but not to lead the company. That's the problem". 
Kempin's book release has gotten him television interviews on Bloomberg TV and Fox Business.

Sobolev spaces for planar domains

In mathematics, Sobolev spaces for planar domains are one of the principal techniques used in the theory of partial differential equations for solving the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems for the Laplacian in a bounded domain in the plane with smooth boundary. The methods use the theory of bounded operators on Hilbert space. They can be used to deduce regularity properties of solutions and to solve the corresponding eigenvalue problems.
Sobolev spaces with boundary conditions.
Let be a bounded domain with smooth boundary. Since is contained in a large square in , it can be regarded as a domain in by identifying opposite sides of the square. The theory of Sobolev spaces on can be found in , an account which is followed in several later textbooks such as and .
For an integer, the (restricted) Sobolev space is defined as the closure of in the standard Sobolev space .

Invertibility of.
The operator defines an isomorphism between and . In fact it is a Fredholm operator of index . The kernel of in consists of constant functions and none of these except zero vanish on the boundary of . Hence the kernel of is and is invertible.
In particular the equation has a unique solution in for in .
Eigenvalue problem.
Let be the operator on defined by
where is the inclusion of in and of in , both compact operators by Rellich's theorem. The operator is compact, self-adjoint and with for all . By the spectral theorem, there is a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions in with
Since , lies in . Setting , the are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian:
Sobolev spaces without boundary condition.
To determine the regularity properties of the eigenfunctions and solutions of
enlargements of the Sobolev spaces have to be considered. Let be the space of smooth functions on which with their derivatives extend continuously to . By Borel's lemma, these are precisely the restrictions of smooth functions on . The Sobolev space is defined to the Hilbert space completion of this space for the norm
This norm agrees with the Sobolev norm on so that can be regarded as a closed subspace of . Unlike , is not naturally a subspace of , but the map restricting smooth functions from to is continuous for the Sobolev norm so extends by continuity to a map .
Regularity for Dirichlet problem.
Regularity for dual Dirichlet problem.
If with in and in with , then lies in .
Take a decomposition with supported in and supported in a collar of the boundary. Standard Sobolev theory for can be applied to : elliptic regularity implies that it lies in and hence . lies in of a collar, diffeomorphic to an annulus, so it suffices to prove the result with a collar and replaced by
The proof proceeds by induction on , proving simultaneously the inequality
for some constant depending only on . It is straightforward to establish this inequality for , where by density can be taken to be smooth of compact support in :
The collar is diffeomorphic to an annulus. The rotational flow on the annulus induces a flow on the collar with corresponding vector field . Thus corresponds to the vector field . The radial vector field on the annulus is a commuting vector field which on the collar gives a vector field proportional to the normal vector field. The vector fields and commute.
The difference quotients can be formed for the flow . The commutators are second order differential operators from to . Their operators norms are uniformly bounded for near ; for the computation can be carried out on the annulus where the commutator just replaces the coefficients of by their difference quotients composed with . On the other hand lies in , so the inequalities for apply equally well for :
The uniform boundedness of the difference quotients implies that lies in with
It follows that lies in where is the vector field
Moreover satisfies a similar inequality to .
Let be the orthogonal vector field
It can also be written as for some smooth nowhere vanishing function on a neighbourhood of the collar.
It suffices to show that lies in . For then
so that and lie in and must lie in .
To check the result on , it is enough to show that and lie in . Note that
are vector fields. But then
with all terms on the right hand side in . Moreover the inequalities for show that
Hence
Smoothness of eigenfunctions.
It follows by induction from the regularity theorem for the dual Dirichlet problem that the eigenfunctions of in lie in . Moreover any solution of with in and in must have in . In both cases by the vanishing properties, the eigenfunctions and vanish on the boundary of .
Solving the Dirichlet problem.
The dual Dirichlet problem can be used to solve the Dirichlet problem:
By Borel's lemma is the restriction of a function in . Let be the smooth solution of with on . Then solves the Dirichlet problem. By the maximal principle, the solution is unique.
Application to smooth Riemann mapping theorem.
The solution to the Dirichlet problem can be used to prove a strong form of the Riemann mapping theorem for simply connected domains with smooth boundary. The method also applies to a region diffeomorphic to an annulus. For multiply connected regions with smooth boundary have given a method for mapping the region onto a disc with circular holes. Their method involves solving the Dirichlet problem with a non-linear boundary condition. They construct a function such that:
The solution is given by
where the integral is taken over any path in . It is easily verified that and exist and are given by the corresponding derivatives of . Thus is a smooth function on , vanishing at . By the Cauchy-Riemann is smooth on , holomorphic on and . The function is only defined up to multiples of , but the function
is a holomorphic on and smooth on . By construction, and for . Since has winding number , so too does . On the other hand only for where there is a simple zero. So by the argument principle assumes every value in the unit disc, , exactly once and does not vanish inside . To check that the derivative on the boundary curve is non-zero amounts to computing the derivative of , i.e. the derivative of should not vanish on the boundary curve. By the Cauchy-Riemann equations these tangential derivative are up to a sign the directional derivative in the direction of the normal to the boundary. But vanishes on the boundary and is strictly negative in since . The Hopf lemma implies that the directional derivative of in the direction of the outward normal is strictly positive. So on the boundary curve, has nowhere vanishing derivative. Since the boundary curve has winding number one, defines a diffeomorphism of the boundary curve onto the unit circle. Accordingly is a smooth diffeomorphism, which restricts to a holomorphic map and a smooth diffeomorphism between the boundaries.
Similar arguments can be applied to prove the Riemann mapping theorem for a doubly connected domain bounded by simple smooth curves (the inner curve) and (the outer curve). By translating we can assume 1 lies on the outer boundary. Let be the smooth solution of the Dirichlet problem with on the outer curve and on the inner curve. By the maximum principle for in and so by the Hopf lemma the normal derivatives of are negative on the outer curve and positive on the inner curve. The integral of over the boundary is zero by Stoke's theorem so the contributions from the boundary curves cancel. On the other hand on each boundary curve the contribution is the integral of the normal derivative along the boundary. So there is a constant such that satisfies
on each boundary curve. The harmonic conjugate of can again be defined by
and is well-defined up to multiples of . The function
is smooth on and holomorphic in . On the outer curve and on the inner curve . The tangential derivatives on the outer curves are nowhere vanishing by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, since the normal derivatives are nowhere vanishing. The normalization of the integrals implies that restricts to a diffeomorphism between the boundary curves and the two concentric circles. Since the images of outer and inner curve have winding number and about any point in the annulus, an application of the argument principle implies that assumes every value within the annulus exactly once; since that includes multiplicities, the complex derivative of is nowhere vanishing in . This is a smooth diffeomorphism of onto the closed annulus , restricting to a holomorphic map in the interior and a smooth diffeomorphism on both boundary curves.
Trace map.
The restriction map extends to a continuous map for . In fact 
so the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality yields
where, by the integral test,
The map is onto since a continuous extension map can be constructed from to . In fact set
where
Thus . If "g" is smooth, then by construction "Eg" restricts to "g" on 1 × T. Moreover "E" is a bounded linear map since
It follows that there is a trace map τ of H"k"(Ω) onto H"k" − ½(∂Ω). Indeed take a tubular neighbourhood of the boundary and a smooth function ψ supported in the collar and equal to 1 near the boundary. Multiplication by ψ carries functions into H"k" of the collar, which can be identified with H"k" of an annulus for which there is a trace map. The invariance under diffeomorphims (or coordinate change) of the half-integer Sobolev spaces on the circle follows from the fact that an equivalent norm on "H""k" + ½(T) is given by
It is also a consequence of the properties of τ and "E" (the "trace theorem"). In fact any diffeomorphism "f" of T induces a diffeomorphism "F" of T2 by acting only on the second factor. Invariance of H"k"(T2) under the induced map "F"* therefore implies invariance of H"k" − ½(T) under "f"*, since "f"* = τ ∘ "F"* ∘ "E".
Further consequences of the trace theorem are the two exact sequences
and
where the last map takes "f" in H2(Ω) to "f"|∂Ω and ∂"n""f"|∂Ω. There are generalizations of these sequences to H"k"(Ω) involving higher powers of the normal derivative in the trace map:
The trace map to takes "f" to 
Abstract formulation of boundary value problems.
The Sobolev space approach to the Neumann problem cannot be phrased quite as directly as that for the Dirichlet problem. The main reason is that for a function in , the normal derivative cannot be a priori defined at the level of Sobolev spaces. Instead an alternative formulation of boundary value problems for the Laplacian on a bounded region in the plane is used. It employs Dirichlet forms, sesqulinear bilinear forms on , or an intermediate closed subspace. Integration over the boundary is not involved in defining the Dirichlet form. Instead, if the Dirichlet form satisfies a certain positivity condition, termed coerciveness, solution can be shown to exist in a weak sense, so-called "weak solutions". A general regularity theorem than implies that the solutions of the boundary value problem must lie in , so that they are strong solutions and satisfy boundary conditions involving the restriction of a function and its normal derivative to the boundary. The Dirichlet problem can equally well be phrased in these terms, but because the trace map is already defined on , Dirichlet forms do not need to be mentioned explicitly and the operator formulation is more direct. A unified discussion is given in and briefly summarised below. It is explained how the Dirichlet problem, as discussed above, fits into this framework. Then a detailed treatment of the Neumann problem from this point of view is given following .
The HIlbert space formulation of boundary value problems for the Laplacian on a bounded region in the plane proceeds from the following data:
A weak solution of the boundary value problem given initial data in is defined by the following:
For both the Dirichlet and Neumann problem
For the Dirichlet problem . In this case
By the trace theorem the solution satisfies in .
For the Neumann problem is taken to be .
Application to Neumann problem.
The classical Neumann problem on consists in solving the boundary value problem
Green's theorem implies that for 
Thus if in and satisfies the Neumann boundary conditions, , and so is constant in .
Hence the Neumann problem has a unique solution up to adding constants.
Consider the Hermitian form on defined by
Since is in duality with , there is a unique element in such that
The map is an isometry of onto , so in particular is bounded.
In fact
So
On the other hand any in defines a bounded conjugate-linear form on sending to . By the Riesz–Fischer theorem, there exists such that
Hence and so is surjective. Define a bounded linear operator on by
where is the map , a compact operator, and is the map , its adjoint, so also compact.
The operator has the following properties:
Regularity for Neumann problem.
Weak solutions are strong solutions.
The first main regularity result shows that a weak solution expressed in terms of the operator and the Dirichlet form is a strong solution in the classical sense, expressed in terms of the Laplacian and the Neumann boundary conditions. Thus if with , then , satisfies and . Moreover for some constant independent of ,
Note that
since
Take a decomposition with supported in and supported in a collar of the boundary.
The operator is characterized by
Then
so that
The function and are treated separately, being essentially subject to usual elliptic regularity considerations for interior points while requires special treatment near the boundary using difference quotients. Once the strong properties are established in terms of and the Neumann boundary conditions, the "bootstrap" regularity results can be proved exactly as for the Dirichlet problem.
Interior estimates.
The function lies in where is a region with closure in . If and 
By continuity the same holds with replaced by and hence . So
Hence regarding as an element of , . Hence . Since for , we have . Moreover
so that
Boundary estimates.
The function is supported in a collar contained in a tubular neighbourhood of the boundary. The difference quotients can be formed for the flow and lie in , so the first inequality is applicable:
The commutators are uniformly bounded as operators from to . This is equivalent to checking the inequality
for , smooth functions on a collar. This can be checked directly on an annulus, using invariance of Sobolev spaces under dffeomorphisms and the fact that for the annulus the commutator of with a differential operator is obtained by applying the difference operator to the coefficients after having applied to the function:
Hence the difference quotients are uniformly bounded, and therefore with
Hence and satisfies a similar inequality to :
Let be the orthogonal vector field. As for the Dirichlet problem, to show that , it suffices to show that .
To check this, it is enough to show that . As before
are vector fields. On the other hand for , so that and define the same distribution on . Hence
Since the terms on the right hand side are pairings with functions in , the regularity criterion shows that . Hence since both terms lie in and have the same inner products with 's.
Moreover the inequalities for show that
Hence
It follows that . Moreover
Neumann boundary conditions.
Since , Green's theorem is applicable by continuity. Thus for ,
Hence the Neumann boundary conditions are satisfied:
where the left hand side is regarded as an element of and hence .
Regularity of strong solutions.
The main result here states that if and , then and
for some constant independent of .
Like the ocrresponding result for the Dirichlet problem, this is proved by induction on . For , is also a weak solution of the Neumann problem so satisfies the estimate above for . The Neumann boundary condition can be written
Since commutes with the vector field corresponding to the period flow , the inductive method of proof used for the Dirichlet problem works equally well in this case: for the difference quotients preserve the boundary condition when expressed in terms of .
Smoothness of eigenfunctions.
It follows by induction from the regularity theorem for the Neumann problem that the eigenfunctions of in lie in . Moreover any solution of with in and in must have in . In both cases by the vanishing properties, the normal derivatives of the eigenfunctions and vanish on .
Solving the associated Neumann problem.
The method above can be used to solve the associated Neumann boundary value problem:
By Borel's lemma is the restriction of a function . Let be a smooth function such that near the boundary. Let be the solution of with . Then solves the boundary value problem.

The Missionary Position (band)

The Missionary Position is an American rock band that creates a mix of hard rock, blues and funk influences into their music. The band is from Seattle, Washington in the United States.
History.
Following the demise of Angell's band Post Stardom Depression, he formed The Missionary Position with an old friend and fellow Seattle musician, Benjamin Anderson. When Jeff Angell and Benjamin Anderson began playing a Thursday night residency at a club in Seattle, Washington, they hadn't yet settled on a name. Those Thursday lounge nights were billed as The Missionary Position, and Angell said people thought that was the band's name. So rather than fight it, Angell and Anderson embraced what the steadily growing number of Thursday night fans already had—they were now in The Missionary Position.
In 2009 they recorded "Diamonds In A Dead Sky" and released it on the band's label The Boredom Killing Business. The band supported the release by touring nationally. 
The song "Let's Start A Fire" was used for the Independent Film Channel's promotional campaign for its series "Indie Screams".
In 2012 The Missionary Position released their sophomore album titled "Consequences".

Fall of Enugu

The Fall of Enugu, (October 4, 1967), was a military conflict between Nigerian and Biafran forces. Enugu was invaded after the Biafran retreat from the Mid-Western Region only 14 days earlier after the Nigerian 2nd and 3rd Marine Division cleared them of the area.
Prelude.
When Nsukka fell to the Nigerian Army under General Olusegun Obasanjo the Biafran President, Odumegwu Ojukwu, knew that his capital would be the Nigerian's next target. After a failed invasion of Nsukka on July 30, 1967 resulted in the death of Major Kaduna Nzeogwu President Ojukwu began drawing up plans for an invasion of Nigeria's Mid-Western Region in an attempt to divert attention away from Enugu. The invasion of August 9 was a tremendous success for the Biafrans and was followed by a sort of 44 day stalemate, before it was broken by the Nigerian 2nd Division's invasion of Ore. Biafran soldiers retreated from the region on September 20, 1967 and fled back to their homeland, pursued by Nigerian soldiers. The commander of Nigerian troops stationed in Nsukka, General Obasanjo, was relieved of his command and replaced with Lt. Col. Theophilus Danjuma.
Enugu to Ogboja.
On October 4, 1967 Lt. Col. Danjuma led a division of Nigerian soldiers from Nsukka 60km southwards towards Enugu. When news of the invasion reached President Ojukwu in Enugu he began evacuating his capital of both government officials and citizens, thinking they'd be massacred by the invading Nigerian soldiers. A unit of Biafran soldiers that were stationed inside the city retreated to Ogoja but were pursued by Danjuma's troops. When the two sides met in Ogoja Nigerian artillery began bombarding the city while ground forces moved into the city. Half the civilian population of Ogoja fled the city while bloody house-to-house fighting took hold of the city for the entire day. The Biafrans were forced to retreat while 300 captured Biafran soldiers were executed by their Nigerian captors.
Aftermath.
After Enugu fell to Danjuma President Ojukwu moved his capital to Umuahia and surrounded it with defenses. On October 5 thousands of civilians in Asaba were massacred by the Nigerian 2nd Division under General Murtala Mohammed after being forced to attend a public dance, known as the Asaba massacre. The 2nd Division attempted numerous invasions of Onitsha but all were repulsed, before it was finally captured by the 2nd Division on March 20, 1968.

Dipterocarpus obtusifolius

Dipterocarpus obtusifolius is a common species of tree in the family Dipterocarpaceae found throughout Southeast Asia, including Andaman Islands, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Three varieties have been published: var. "subnudus" Ryan & Kerr; var. "glabricalyx" Smitinand; and var. "vestitus" (Wall. ex Dyer) Smitinand. While legitimate, these varieties are as yet of low confidence level. The variety "D. obtusifolius" var. "subnudus" differed by having completely hairless leaves and is found only in the south of Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand.
Trees are large, up to 30m tall, grow in dry Dipterocarp forest, and the red brown wood is used in general construction. In Cambodia, the resin from the tree is used to make torches, drinking water was obtained by cutting young stalks and the wood gave boards regarded as non-durable in construction, while in some areas of the Kompong Chhnang Province it is an important firewood source.

Brooke Duff

Brooke Duff is a New Zealand recording artist and songwriter. She was discovered by Illegal Musik, who eventually signed her to the record label, along with its counterpart Warner Music Group. Duff released her debut single, "Til The End" in July 2012. The single reached number nine on the New Zealand Singles Chart.
Early life and career.
Brooke Duff was born in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1991. Duff has been singing since the age of ten through her Church, but she moved to Australia for her career. She was recognized while she was singing at Melbourne’s Beaumaris Theatre with a school production, and was the lead role in ‘Patsi’ and the role of Wendy in ‘Peter Pan’. At the same time, she was selected as one of 50 youth singers from around Australia to form the Australian Youth Choir in 2003. According to sources, she is Christian. She was brought to the attention of Illegal via mutual friends in late 2009 and Head of A&R, Mark Arona, opted for a long-term strategic approach to her career development. She had attended Riccarton High School in Christchurch.
2011-present: Musical career and "Til The End".
Around early 2010, she has been working with the Illegal Musik team building her music catalogue and industry experience. She has been fortunate to feature and collaborate on tracks with the Illegal Banditz and K.One. Then in 2011, she moved to Auckland due to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, which caused devastation in the city. She performed at the "Band Together" concert to help fundraising the earthquake, with a total of 140,000 Cantabarians attending, becoming her biggest performance to date. Duff was featured on K.One's single "Bring That Beat Back", which ultimately peaked at one on the New Zealand iTunes Hip Hop Charts.
In 2012, Duff released her first single entitled "Til The End" on 13 July 2012. The song was produced by Vince Harder and NOX, both originating from the Illegal Musik production house. The song debuted at number nine on the New Zealand Singles Chart (which features singles from New Zealand artists), becoming Duff's first top ten single. The song rose to number two, and had officially charted on the New Zealand Singles Chart at number twenty-seven.
Brooke discussed the concept of "Til The End":
A fan had asked Duff if an accompanying music video will be produced for the single, which she replied; "Yes! We've already shot it, just waiting to release it! Keep an eye out! :) can't wait to show you all! #excited". In an interview with The Edge, she was asked if she was in production with an upcoming studio album, which she replied; "You’ll have to wait and see...". It was officially confirmed by RIANZ that she would be releasing an album at the end of 2012.
It was recently announced that Duff will be joining Titanium's Come On Home Tour as a supporting act for the boy band.
Influences and musical style.
While interviewed with Glassons Blog, she was asked what music inspires her and she said "I guess when you’re making pop music you tend to listen to other pop artists, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Jessie J. But I also love artists like Emeli Sande, Frank Ocean, Jazmine Sullivan [...] I go through music fads where I will only listen to a particular artist, at the moment it’s Kimbra (another fellow NZ musician)."
In trends and fashion, she responded that she is a huge fan of Jeffery Campbell for his "shoes". She also said "You seriously feel like you could conquer anything in them Collections they’re super shiny, nice and stretchy and they always get comments." She cites Blake Lively and The Olsen Twins as fashion influences.

The women's field hockey tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics was the 7th edition of the field hockey event for women at the Summer Olympic Games. It was held over an eleven-day period beginning on 16 August, and culminating with the medal finals on 26 August. All games were played at the hockey centre within the Hellinikon Olympic Complex in Athens, Greece.
Germany won the gold medal for the first time after defeating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final. Argentina won the bronze medal by defeating China 1–0.
Qualification.
Each of the continental champions from five federations received an automatic berth. Alongside with the five teams qualifying through the Olympic Qualification Tournament, ten teams competed in this tournament.
Although the host nation would have qualified automatically as well, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to give them an automatic berth due to the standard hockey in Greece. Greece appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), however it was turned down. Greece's first option to gain a place at the Olympics was by qualifying for the EuroHockey Nations Championship held in 2003. As they did not qualify for this tournament their last option was to beat Russia, the last ranked team of the Olympic Qualification Tournament in a best of three play-off competition. Russia would have kept its place in the Qualifier regardless of whether it won or lost against Greece. There would, however, have been four places at stake at the tournament if Greece had qualified, rather than the five eventually available as Greece withdrew from participating due to explicit financial reasons.

The 2012–13 Calcutta Premier Division season is the 114th season of the Calcutta Premier Division, a state league within the Indian state of West Bengal. The league kicked-off on 16 August 2012.
Overview.
Format.
On 11 June 2012 it was announced that the Indian Football Association would change the format of the Calcutta Premier Division for 2012–13. For starters they decided to increase the number of teams from 17 to 19. Second they decided to divide those teams into two groups, Group A with 10 teams and Group B with 9 teams. Also the federation decided to split the big four clubs of Kolkata (East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, Prayag United, and Mohammedan) into the two groups.

Earthquake weather

Earthquake weather is a type of weather popularly believed to precede earthquakes.
History.
From the ancient histories of Herodotus to the modern writings of David Lance Goines, the notion that weather can somehow foreshadow coming seismic activity has been the topic of much discussion and debate. Geologist Russell Robinson has described "earthquake weather" as one of the more common pseudoscientific methods of predicting earthquakes.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) website states that, in the 4th Century B.C., Aristotle proposed that earthquakes were caused by winds trapped in subterranean caves. Small tremors were thought to have been caused by air pushing on the cavern roofs, and large ones by the air breaking the surface. This theory led to a belief in 'earthquake weather', that because a large amount of air was trapped underground, the weather would be hot and calm before an earthquake. A later theory stated that earthquakes occurred in calm, cloudy conditions, and were usually preceded by strong winds, fireballs, and meteors. A modern theory proposes that certain cloud formations may be used to predict earthquakes; however, this idea is rejected by most geologists.
Background on earthquakes.
An earthquake is caused by a sudden slip on a fault. Tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they can get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge of a tectonic plate overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that is felt. For example, in California, there are two plates - the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The Pacific Plate consists of most of the Pacific Ocean floor and the California Coast line. The North American Plate comprises most of the North American Continent and parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean floor. The primary boundary between these two plates is the San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas Fault is more than 800 miles long and extends to depths of at least 10 miles. Many other smaller faults like the Hayward (Northern California) and the San Jacinto (Southern California) branch join the San Andreas Fault Zone. The Pacific Plate grinds northwestward past the North American Plate at a rate of about two inches per year.
Psychology.
It has been proposed by W. J. Humphreys that "earthquake weather" is not of geological causes, but merely a psychological manifestation. Humphreys argued that "the general state of irritation and sensitiveness developed in us during the hot, calm, perhaps sultry weather given this name, inclines us to sharper observation of earthquake disturbances and accentuates the impression they make on our senses, so that we retain more vivid memories of such quakes while possibly over-looking entirely the occurrences on other more soothing days".
Scientific validity.
Geologists maintain that there is absolutely no connection between weather and earthquakes. Earthquakes are the result of geologic processes within the earth, and they can happen in any weather and at any time during the year. Earthquakes originate miles underground, while wind, precipitation, temperature, and barometric pressure changes affect only the surface and shallow subsurface of the Earth. Earthquakes are focused at depths well out of the reach of weather, and the forces that cause earthquakes are much larger than the weather forces. Earthquakes occur in all types of weather, in all climate zones, in all seasons of the year, and at any time of day.
Some recent research has found a correlation between a sudden relative spike in atmospheric temperature 2-5 days before an earthquake. It is speculated that this rise is caused by the movement of ions within the earth's crust, related to an oncoming earthquake. However, the atmospheric changes are caused by the earthquake, rather than causing it. Furthermore, this relative change would not cause any single recognizable weather pattern that could be labelled "earthquake weather".
At the 2011 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting, Shimon Wdowinski announced an apparent temporal connection between tropical cyclones and earthquakes.
In April 2013, a team of seismologists at the Georgia Institute of Technology re-examined data from the 2011 Virginia earthquake using pattern-recognition software and found a correlation between hurricane Irene's nearby passage and an unexpected rise in the number of aftershocks.

The Unholy Pilgrim

The Unholy Pilgrim is a historical novel, written by R.F. Tapsell and published in 1968, which is set in turbulent 13th-century Europe, and follows the adventures of Tancred of Varville.
Plot summary.
Tancred is a young Norman knight on pilgrimage to Jerusalem; not for the salvation of his soul, but for the recovery of his honor and his inheritance. Across flaming seas – as the war galleys of the Venetian Republic, the Genoese Republic, and the Saracens fight for the control of the Aegean Sea in the wake of the Fourth Crusade – Tancred sets sail for the Holy Land.
"The Unholy Pilgrim" traces his stormy progress through shipwreck off the Dalmatian coast, through near-fatal encounters with the enemies plotting against him, and through bloody naval battles. It continues through days of luxury and conspiracy on the sumptuous galley bearing Melinda of Ibelin, one of the noblest ladies of the Frankish East, through his tumultuous courtship of Melinda's handmaiden Eleanor, to the climatic siege of Metos, where –- by his feats of ingenuity and courage –- his knight's honor is refurbished and his inheritance secured.

He is considered one of those who have renewed figurative expression in the Nordic sculpture. He works with many materials, from bronze to snow and ice. But the stone, usually marble and granite, has been his main material. In recent years, often in combination with glass. He is married to the Czech artist Alena Matejka.
Education.
He studied Archaeology and Art History at the Uppsala University, Sweden. Later, a study at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts in Oslo (1982–85) focusing on the three dimensionality work. The reason why he chose Oslo was a desire to work with figurative sculptures.
Work.
Lars Widenfalk has been involved in several projects in the three-dimensional expression, often in collaboration with his wife Alena Matejka. She is educated in the Czech Bohemian glass tradition. It was she who introduced him to the crystal glass, a material he often uses in combination with stone.
His imagery is figurative, and the early works were often realistic and figurative. But this has changed to sculptures with symbolic and soulish expression. Many of his works is around the theme of "place and people". The room or the house is usually open in a simple geometric shapes. Marked only with four corner columns and a roof. Usually, a human full-length or only a human head located in the housing. He has also built several large aquarium, where he puts his sculptures, in water the stone's color became much more intense. He also placed living fish in the aquariums, along with his sculpture.
One of his major works are the black violin, "Blackbird", made from stone after drawings by Antonio Stradivari (Stradivarius), but with some technical adjustments in order to play. The violin is made of diabase (dolerite), a rock that was left over from his grandfather's tombstone. Thinnest the stone is just 2.5 mm thick. The thin walls of the resonance box is contoured cut with water and then machined with hand tools. It took two years to make the violin.
An installation "Cross My Arms", St. Agostino, Pietrasanta, Italy, in 2011, consisted of twelve rather like sculptures of maidens with their arms crossed over the chest, made of white marble. A similar sculpture of a woman with arms crossed, is "Listen to Your Heart", a granite sculpture with a height of 260 cm.
He has had numerous exhibitions, most in Sweden, but several abroad, mainly in Norway, Denmark, Czech Republic and Italy. Lars Widenfalk is represented in various collections, including the Swedish State Art Council, Göteborgs Art museum, Sundsvalls Museum and House of Parliament in Sweden.

Islamic economics in Pakistan

The Islamization of the National Economy of Pakistan, (sometimes also rendered as "Islamization of Economy"), was a controversial economic policy measure programme in the economic context in the history of Pakistan. Conceived in the end-year of 1977, the programme was hastily enforced in 1979 in an attempt to counter the contemporary period of Stagflation, and to established a new systemic economic cycle which came to known as "Interest-free economy.
Introduced and its official enforcement on 10 February 1979, this programme came in a direct response to nationalization programme of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), after the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war. Under this programme, the Islamic methods of "Zakāt" and "Ushr" were introduced with fundamental principles of Sharia laws concerning the issues of economics. The programme gained subsequent public support in a referendum and was integrated in state-sponsored Islamization. On January 1, 1980, approximately 7,000 interest-free counters were opened at all the nationalized commercial banks. Thus, Pakistan became the first country in the Muslim world to embark the full fledged work on the Islamic banking system with concerning of the Interest-free economy.
However in spite of its initial gains and success, the programme failed to achieved international targets and to meet commercial interactions with other major international banks. Therefore, after the mysterious death of President Zia-ul-Haq followed by the quick general elections in 1988, the programme was halted by upcoming people-elected Prime minister Benazir Bhutto who terminated the programme the same year whilst tightened the grip of the nationalization programme. After the conclusion of 1990 general elections, newly elected Prime minister Nawaz Sharif replaced the legacies of this programme with privatization and economic liberalization programme in order to increase the GDP growth rate of the country, and to meet with international economic reforms after the 1991 Soviet collapse.
Islamic conservatism and economic stagflation.
The Martial law was again enforced in the country for the third time on 5 July 1977, to divert a serious political crises in the country. Since 1970, the country had been under serious period of stagflation and an attempt to end this subsequent period was brutally failed by the Pakistan Peoples Party who came in political power after the 1971 war with India. After enforcing the martial law in Pakistan for the third time, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq signed and issued executive decree on "Zakāt (poor-due), "Ushr" (Tithe), termination of "Riba" (Interest-rate) and elimination of "mudarabah" (Profit-sharing) were promulgated with the avowed aim of transforming the Pakistan's national economy into an Islamic economic system.
The military government employed eminent scholars and economists led under professor Khurshid Ahmad to compile laws about Islamic financing. On January 1, 1980, President General Zia-ul-Haq appeared on national television and announced the introduction of a "Profit and Loss Sharing System", according to which, an account holder was to share the loss and profit of the bank. This was followed by the establishment of the "Zakāt" and "Ushr" Ordinances on 20 June 1980, to Islamize the interest-free economic system. The new system expelled the secular and international financial institutions and consisted only Islamic organizations, associations and institutions. The "Zakāt" was to be deducted from bank accounts of Muslims at the rate of 2.5% annually above the balance of Rs. 3,000. The "Ushr" was levied on the yield of agricultural land in cash or kind at the rate of 10% of the agricultural yield, annually.
Personally authorized by General Zia-ul-Haq, the government freely appointed Central, Provincial, District and Tehsil Zakat Committees to distribute Zakat funds to the needy, poor, orphans and widows. The Shia Muslim were exempted from Zakat deduction from their accounts due to their own religious beliefs.
Failure and collapse of the system.
Despite its success in initial first five years, the programme was fractured in many obvious reasons, and the stagflation again began to bite the country's resources, as well as many technical and scientific problems arise in the new economic system that the military government and Zia-ul-Haq himself was unable to solve. The newly elected, but technocratic government of Prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo refused to pass the new and more stricter version of Sharia bill, followed by lifting and resumption of political parties, including Communist Party and Pakistan Peoples Party— both steps frustrated President Zia-ul-Haq. Furthermore, Prime minister Junejo reached a secret understanding with the Soviet Union and proceeded with the 1988 Geneva Accords, allowing Soviet Union to peacefully withdraw their troops from Afghanistan. As repercussion, Zia surprisingly dismissed the new government of Junejo on May 29, 1988, and the dissolved parliament the next day. In explaining his action, Zia pointed to the failure to carry Islamization forward and also to corruption, deterioration of law and order, and mismanagement of the economy.
However on the other hand, the senior economist conducted their studies to find the causes of the failure and specifically pointed out that "there are three main reasons that the Islamic banking and economics system effectively failed." First and the foremost is, "lack of political will"; while the second being the "lack of awareness about the potentials of Islamic banking"; finally, the "inexperience banking sector of Pakistan" that led failure of the programme. While other economist remains convinced that since its introduction, "very little has been done to attract the deposits from the public." In 2000, the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, dr. Ishrat Hussain contended that "Pakistan is far removed from the day when it will be ready to adopt a full-fledged Islamic economic system".
In 1999, Economist dr. Yoginder Sikand observed that "Islamising" the economy in Pakistan cannot be seen apart from the wider attempt of regimes and political elites with low levels of legitimacy and popularity to win public support using religion as a convenient tool. "Rather than focusing on the Islamic imperatives of equality and social justice, which are so central to the Qur’anic text, successive regimes in Pakistan have sought to focus on particular economic injunctions of the Qur’an abstracted from wider issues of justice and equality", Sikand maintained.
Furthermore, Dr. Sikand argues that the debate on "Islamising" Pakistan’s national economy has been sought to be reduced simply to issues related to interest-free banking, the abolition of "Riba" (interest), the laws of inheritance and the levy of the ""Zakāt"". These methods and thoughts are sought to be presented as providing "magical solutions" to the problems of a complex modern economic problems that Pakistan's national economy has faced since its independence. After the death of general Zia-ul-Haq, this programme was finally came to its conclusion when it was terminated by Prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 1988, followed by removing the legacies of this programme in 1990 when Nawaz Sharif launched a twin intensified programme, Privatization programme and the economic liberalisation to promote the GDP growth rate as well as reverting the economy back to Westernized economic system.

Rander

Rander is a town in Surat district in the state of Gujarat, India, located on the bank of the Tapti River, from the city of Surat. It is also known as "City of Mosques".
History.
During the rule of Shanprat in AD 200 many Jain Temples were built around Rander. There was some historic belief that Rander was an important port of Western Hind. Business was also conducted with Arab, Miser, Sudan and other western countries through the Rander Port.
The earliest recorded mention of Rander was in the year 1050 in the book "Kitab al Hind" by Al Biruni. By the late medieval period it had become an important port in western India, though smaller than ports such as Broach in Gujarat. Ships laden with spices, silk, benzoin and porcelain from as far as Sumatra and China docked in Rander. Nawayat Arabs, who settled in the area by 1225, were the main traders.
In 1514, the Portuguese traveller Duarte Barbosa wrote:
"Ranel (Rander) is a good town of the Moors, built of very pretty houses and squares. It is a rich and agreeable place ... the Moors of the town trade with Malacca, Bengal, Tawasery (Tannasserim), Pegu, Martaban, and Sumatra in all sort of spices, drugs, silks, musk, benzoin and porcelain. They possess very large and fine ships and those who wish Chinese articles will find them there very completely. The Moors of this place are white and well dressed and very rich they have pretty wives, and in the furniture of these houses have china vases of many kinds, kept in glass cupboards well arranged. Their women are not secluded like other Moors, but go about the city in the day time, attending to their business with their faces uncovered as in other parts."
Thus according to Barbosa, the Moors of Rander did not observe the Islamic purdah. However the piety of Navayat Arabs is evident by the many mosques and durghas they built. By 1225, Arabs merchants and sailors settled in the area after displacing the local Jain rulers. In 1874, the "Hope" bridge was built across the river. Rander to villages on the other side of the river.
Rander Mehril-e-Islam.
the Rander Mehfil-e-Islam Kutub Khana was established 1888, and registered in 1913, as a charity society for Muslims.
The main objective was to provide educational, financial, social and religious-activities and to encourage the community to actively participate in these fields.

Mary Martha Pearson

Mary Martha Pearson (née Dutton) (1798 –1871) was an English portrait painter.
Life.
She born was on 18 June 1798 in Birchin Lane in the City of London, daughter of Robert Dutton, a bookseller who also ran a circulating library in Gracechurch Street, and his wife Martha, daughter of John Comberbach of Haughton Hall. She had lessons with a drawing-master called Lewis. From 1813 she made copies from the old masters in the gallery of the British Institution in Pall Mall, and in 1815 was awarded a gold medal by the Institution for her copy of Claude's "The Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba". This copy, and one of "Titian's Daughter", were then hung alongside the originals. 
In 1817 she married Charles Pearson, who later became the solicitor to the City of London and a Member of Parliament. Following her marriage, she continued her study of the old masters, as well as painting portraits and some landscapes. She won silver medals for views of the Rhine, and of Bodiam Castle.
She exhibited 31 works, almost all portraits, at the Royal Academy between 1821 and 1842. She was an early member of the Society of British Artists, and exhibited 37 works at their gallery in Suffolk Street. Reviewing her portrait of Lady Mostyn, shown there in 1834, the critic of "Arnold's Magazine of the Fine Arts" said The portraits by Mrs. Pearson have ever an air of identity about them, and in the opinion of many, this, after all, in portraiture, is the only quality that the artist need to be so very solicitous to produce. The head of Lady Mostyn, however, is worthy of higher note.
When her husband developed a site in Westminster, on the south side of St James's Park, the block of buildings constructed included both offices for himself, and a studio and gallery for his wife.
She painted numerous portraits of leading figures in the Corporation of London, including several Lord Mayors. "The Times", reviewing her painting of one of them, William Taylor Copeland, shown at the Royal Academy in 1836, said that, in the light of her civic portraits, "the least the Corporation of London could do, would be to present the fair delineator of their well-fed countenances with the freedom of the city, emblazoned on a rosewood palette". 
She did not show work at any of the major London exhibitions after 1842. In 1844 she presented a portrait of Lord Chief Justice Denman to the Corporation of London. According to a report in "The Athenæum Journal", at the time, her accompanying letter announced it as "the last picture of that magnitude which it is her intention to undertake."
Her sister, a miniature painter (named in the catalogues simply as "Miss Dutton") showed portraits of her at the Royal Academy in 1834 and 1852.
She had a daughter, Mary Dutton Pearson. She died on 15 April 1871, aged 72, at Brighton, and was buried with her husband in a large sarcophagus tomb at West Norwood Cemetery.
Subjects.
Her portrait subjects included:
Charles Turner made mezzotints after her portraits of Sir John Key, Edward Pryce Baron Mostyn, Richard Grimshaw Lomax and David Salomons.
