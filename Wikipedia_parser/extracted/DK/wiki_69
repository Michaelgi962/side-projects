Franz Ignaz Beck

Franz Ignaz Beck (Mannheim, February 20, 1734 – Bordeaux, December 31, 1809) was a German violinist, composer, conductor and music teacher who spent the greater part of his life in France, where he became director of the Bordeaux Grand Théâtre. Possibly the most talented pupil of Johann Stamitz, Beck is an important representative of the second generation of the so-called Mannheim school. His fame rests on his 24 symphonies that are among the most original and striking of the pre-Classical period. He was one of the first composers to introduce the regular use of wind instruments in slow movements and put an increasing emphasis on thematic development. His taut, dramatic style is also remarkable for its employment of bold harmonic progressions, flexible rhythms and highly independent part writing.
Biography.
1734-1754 Youth in Mannheim.
Franz Ignaz Beck began his violin studies with his father, Johann Aloys Beck (died 1742), an oboist and Rector of the Choir School at the Palatinate Court in Mannheim. He also learned double bass and organ, among other instruments, and eventually came under the tutelage of Johann Stamitz, the director of instrumental music and leader of the brilliant Mannheim court orchestra. Beck's talents were quickly recognized and the Prince elector of the Electorate of the Palatinate, Charles Theodore undertook responsibility for his education. As a youth Beck was very much in favour with the Mannheim court and named chamber virtuoso of the Prince elector.
1755-1757 Violinist in Venice and Naples.
His time in Mannheim came to an abrupt end when he - seemingly fatally - wounded an opponent in a duel (allegedly because of jealousy), an act that forced him to leave Germany. It is hard to ascertain whether this is really what happened or just a Berlioz-like cloak and dagger story. The only source for this tale is Beck’s pupil Henri Blanchard who published this account in a biography of his former teacher in the "Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris" (1845). According to Blanchard, Beck’s opponent had only feigned his death, but Beck was not to learn this for several years.
When Beck’s six symphonies op. 3 were published in Paris several years later (1762) the edition bore this title:
From this it is sometimes inferred that the story of Beck fighting a duel was probably a hoax. If Beck, so the reasoning goes, had in all truth been forced to flee from the Mannheim court because he had killed someone in a duel, then he would not have possessed the audacity to openly advertise the fact that he used to be a chamber virtuoso with exactly the same court. However, seen from another angle this might corroborate the truth of Blanchard’s story. If Beck had indeed "not" killed the other man and he knew by then that everything had been a vicious prank and his opponent alive, then the story might be true after all.
Whatever the circumstances of his departure, from Mannheim Beck made his way to Venice where he appeared as a violinist and studied composition with Baldassare Galuppi. Galuppi, whose name as a composer has faded over the centuries, was between 1750 and 1765 the most performed opera composer in Europe. In Mannheim he was especially well known. Several of his operas (16 all together) were staged at Mannheim in the middle of the 18th century. Thus, Galuppi would have known Mannheim and the fact that Mannheim had the leading orchestra in Europe. This helps to explain why Beck after his dramatic flight had probably little difficulty to establish himself in Venice and become Galuppi’s pupil.
After three years in Venice he eloped to Naples with one Anna Oniga, his future wife and mother of his seven children. It seems that Beck's career as a composer started largely during his years in Italy; this may also explain why in many traits he shows himself to be quite his own man and rather independent of the typical Mannheim style.
1757-1760 Fame in France.
After his sojourn in Italy Beck moved to Marseilles where he became concert master at the theatre orchestra. The exact date of his arrival in France is uncertain yet for the year 1757 the performance of one of his symphonies in Paris is documented. When Beck’s Parisian publisher Venier announced the publication of Beck's op. 3 in the November of 1762 he introduced Beck to with these words: "Actualmente Primo Violino del Concerto di Marsilia". Between 1757 and 1762 all of his 24 symphonies were published in rapid succession by Parisian firms. At least seven performances of Beck's symphonies are known to have been given in Marseilles in 1760-61.
1761-1791 Kapellmeister in Bordeaux.
In 1761 Beck moved from Marseilles to Bordeaux where he became director of concerts and was appointed musical director with the dramatic company of the Marechal Duc de Richelieu, which in 1780 moved into the newly built Grand Théâtre. He also was active as organist and teacher. Among his more prominent pupils were Pierre Gaveaux, Henri Blanchard and one Boscha. On 24 October 1774 he was appointed organist at St Seurin, Bordeaux, where his improvisatory powers won him admiration from the congregation.
By the time he was settled in Bordeaux Beck's best times as a composer were all but over. Much of what he wrote there seems to have been either lost or destroyed by Beck himself. His greatest success came in 1783 when he travelled to Paris to direct the first performance of his Stabat mater in Versailles.
As did many other composers, Beck wrote patriotic and revolutionary music during the Revolution, including a "Hymne á l'Être Suprême". Nevertheless, in 1791 he got into trouble with the new authorities when through caustic remarks he openly ridiculed some overzealous partisans of the new spirit. He seems to have been a self-assured, proud and stubborn man. When he was subsequently put before a revolutionary trial in his nightshirt, he answered questions concerning his attitude towards the revolution with the exclamation: "What could I do against the revolution!?"
1791-1809 Last years in Bordeaux.
Beck’s fortunes declined in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Whereas in the year 1791 he was still able to pay his mother in law a pension of 400 Livres, a few years later he was barely able to support his family.
In 1806 he sent the score of his Stabat Mater with a personal dedication to Napoleon – whether out of genuine admiration or in an attempt to ingratiate himself with the great Corse is hard to decide.
Beck had six daughters, two of whom died early. His only son was commander of a French corvette during the Napoleonic wars, and was held captive by the English for a long time.
Works (Selection).
Orchestral.
Beck’s 24 symphonies are in three movements and follow the Italian "sinfonia" with the customary tempi: fast-slow-fast. The Minuet, as third movement already ubiquitous in Johann Stamitz’ symphonies, is omitted by Beck. According to records cited in the references below (Symphonies op. 3, Nr. 3-5. La Stagione, Frankfurt am Main, Michael Schneider, CPO|Symphonies op. 3, No. 3-5. The Seasons, Frankfurt am Main, Michael Schneider, CPO), it seems that some symphonies do have four movements as well as a minuet; as for the symphonies of Stamitz, some do not have a minuet and have only three movements.
The symphonies Op. 1 are scored for string orchestra; in Op. 2, No. 1 (Callen 7) in addition to the strings two French horns are demanded; op. 3 and 4 are scored for oboes and horns in addition to the string quintet.

Commo

Commo is a telecommunications program which was written and maintained from 1989 to 1998 by Fred P. Brucker. It was a macro-driven package and could be customized by the user. The program, written in optimized assembly language and distributed as shareware, was small and fast.
The macro language used by Commo was simple, with assembly language-like statements surrounded by curly braces. It offered the ability to control most aspects of the terminal. For instance, the following macro would reconfigure the Alt-X key to display a dialog box, allowing the user to confirm before exiting the program:
codice_1
The program's macro and configuration files were free-form text which could be edited with any text editor. This led to popularity among those who wanted to be able to configure the program. 
Fred Brucker actively provided support for screen readers to work with COMMO, which made it a popular program for the visually impaired. The Powermacros add-on made COMMO one of the first Trade Wars 2002 'helper' programs. MacroBBS was a Bulletin board system system written entirely out of COMMO macros.
Mr. Brucker released the last version of COMMO on 25 December 1998.

Connie Rubirosa

Consuela "Connie" Rubirosa is a fictional character, portrayed by Alana de la Garza, who joined the cast of long-running NBC drama series "Law & Order" during the 17th season premiere episode "Fame". She is the only second-chair ADA of "Law & Order" to have appeared in four complete seasons. She later appeared on ' as a series regular until the show's cancellation in May 2011. In January 2014, she appeared on ', where she has become an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York.
Character overview.
Career history.
After graduating Swarthmore College and spending a year working as a kindergarten teacher, Rubirosa joined the Manhattan District Attorney's office in 2004. Shortly thereafter, Rubirosa had a brief sexual relationship with her supervisor, Marcus Woll. Originally, she worked for District Attorney Arthur Branch and second-chaired for Executive Assistant District Attorney Jack McCoy.
With McCoy's promotion to District Attorney (as of the eighteenth season), Rubirosa is assigned to newly promoted Executive Assistant District Attorney Michael Cutter. During the early months of this transition, she is sometimes made to be the unwilling mediator when her two superiors have disagreements regarding law.
After leaving the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, Rubirosa goes on to serve as a Deputy District Attorney in Los Angeles, following the resignations of and . In this capacity, she works alongside .
Rubirosa returned to the "Law & Order" franchise as a federal prosecutor in the "" episode "Jersey Breakdown". She was heading up a joint task force on underage sex trafficking. This episode aired on January 22, 2014.
Family.
She has stated that her father, a doctor, was a Spanish immigrant, whose medical degree was not recognized in the United States and had to work as a nurse for 10 years; this is mentioned in the episode "Melting Pot", in which she deals with an illegal immigrant worker and defendant. Later in the case, she passionately opposes a legal strategy proposed by McCoy which would have detrimentally affected other illegal immigrants who worked for the same contractor but were not part of the crime. She has also told McCoy that she had her sister who had previously been in an abusive relationship. She also had a brother. Her brother was married and had at least two children. His wife almost miscarried their first child in or before 2001. Her mother was Mexican, as she was a descendant of Juan Cortina. Her parents divorced and her mother eventually remarried. Her stepfather died in 2007. In 2011, she moved to Los Angeles to take care of her ailing mother, who suffered a stroke.
Personality.
As demonstrated in "Corner Office", Rubirosa is a strong advocate of women's rights. In "Talking Points", she says she disagrees with the politics of a conservative author who made "Ann Coulter look like Mary Poppins". Nevertheless, on "Home Sweet" she refuses to give credit to a female defense attorney's unjustified feminist trial strategy. In contrast in "Dignity", Rubirosa learns damaging information about a murdered abortion doctor's murder of a newborn, albeit at the clear informed permission of the mother of a baby with birth defects severe enough to guarantee death in hours. Although her superiors order her to delay reporting it to the medical board as irrelevant evidence of a deceased doctor until after the trial, Rubirosa is so moved by the testimony, and concerned by the apparent breach of professional ethics of not immediately informing the defense of the facts, that she defied her instructions. Although Rubirosa requests a transfer to the white collar crime section for this moral conflict, McCoy, deciding that the moral complexities involved in the case and the larger issues needed more flexibility from everyone, orders she and Cutter to resolve their differences.
In "Charity Case", Rubirosa reveals that she has a strong maternal instinct. She has always wanted to have a child, but is appalled at the casual treatment of children as "fashion" by affluent celebrities. She also shows extreme outrage and disgust at the defendant in that episode, who allowed a baby to die due to negligence, and then got a "replacement baby". She is particularly disgusted by the defendant's claim that the nanny was responsible for the child's death, and that she did not recognize that the babies had been switched.
She is briefly bothered by her experiences during "Tango", when a juror in a case she is trying attempts to flirt with her after the trial has adjourned for the day. Shocked, she quickly insists that such communication is inappropriate and must stop. When she learns that Cutter was aware of the juror's feelings towards her and that Cutter's recommendation was based on these feelings, she is angry at him, feeling that he had "pimped out to the jury".
In the episode "Strike", legal aid is on strike and Rubirosa is forced to become the defendant's defense attorney. She proves quite capable, and shows her clear belief in "zealously representing client". Besides being Cutter's opponent throughout the trial, she antagonizes Detective Kevin Bernard in court. She even uses dubious means to suppress incriminating evidence, although Cutter discovers it anyway. Later, she comes to believe her client is guilty, of both this murder and another that he will soon be officially pardoned for. Although she agonizes about violating attorney–client privilege, she decides to give him an ultimatum: take a plea bargain or risk an unfavorable jury verdict. The choice is also influenced by what Rubirosa sees as repeated dishonesty on his part, and she ultimately comments to McCoy that she hopes her action was fair, and not biased by her view that he was guilty. McCoy assures her that he is certain her actions were fair and legal.
She reveals herself to be supportive of using post-9/11 terrorism laws for purposes beyond their original intent in "Rumble", when she comes up with the idea of charging the perpetrators of a park fight with committing a terrorist act after several innocent bystanders are killed in the fray.
She also has a great deal of respect for McCoy, and is slightly protective of him. It is revealed in "Misbegotten" that she and Cutter have an agreement in which he is not allowed to criticize McCoy in front of her, something that he is apparently unhappy with.
She has revealed her dedication to her job in more than one occasion. In the episode "Boy Gone Astray", a death threat is made against her while she is investigating a drug cartel. While she is afraid for her life, she is adamant about remaining on the case. In the end, the lead witness in the case backs out, ending the trial and the threat to her life. In "For the Defense", she is a witness in a brutal shooting against a woman who is supposed to testify in court. Although Cutter gives her the opportunity to stop working on the case, she stays on, determined to do her job no matter what.
In the aforementioned episode ("For The Defense"), she names herself as a co-conspirator in a murder charge, in order to insure that they can charge the defendant with conspiracy to commit murder. No charges are pressed against her, but even Cutter is shocked by her actions, while also proud of her.
When she was in high school, she and her friends started a rumor which almost got the vice principal fired.
Alana de la Garza, who portrays Connie Rubirosa, was pregnant in 2010. Although it was initially suggested that Rubirosa would become pregnant in the series as well, the subsequent cancellation of "L&O" after 20 seasons rendered the matter moot.
Reception.
Ken Tucker writes that "De La Garza is, per the show's distaff tradition, obliged to have Rubirosa scissor her legs around the DA's office. But unlike past office trinkets like Angie Harmon (1998–2001) or Elisabeth Röhm (2001–2005), De La Garza also draws your attention to her sarcastically raised eyebrow when she looks at the clashing McCoy and Cutter as if to say, 'Boys, boys — is that a legal brief in your briefs, or are you just glad to see each other?’"
John Freeman Gill of the "New York Times" writes that "'Law & Order' has been around so long that the datebook in the office of the prosecutor played by Sam Waterston is embossed with the year 1995. But one new ingredient in the show this season, the casting of Alana De La Garza as its first Hispanic assistant district attorney, helped give the "Melting Pot" story both nuance and passion."
Matt Roush of "TV Guide" writes, "Tonight, in another strong episode, it's De La Garza's turn to shine, and she makes the most of it, proving herself a worthy successor to Jill Hennessy and Angie Harmon, my previous favorites in this often-thankless role. She is tough and aggressive, but always sympathetic, as she is forced to go up against her colleague Cutter in court as a temporary (and very reluctant) defense attorney, called into action because the Legal Aid lawyers are all on strike."
Credits.
De la Garza has been credited in 85 episodes of "Law & Order", 8 episodes of "Law & Order: LA", and one episode of "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit", a total of 94 episodes making her the fourth-longest serving prosecutor in the "Law & Order" franchise history, surpassed by Alexandra Cabot ("SVU"), Ron Carver ("CI") and Casey Novak ("SVU").

Aurinko laskee länteen

"Aurinko laskee länteen" ("The sun sets in the west") was the Finnish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1965, performed in Finnish by Viktor Klimenko.
The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following Luxembourg's France Gall with "Poupée de cire, poupée de son" and preceding Yugoslavia's Vice Vukov with "Čežnja". At the close of voting, it had received the dreaded "nul points", placing 15th. This was Finland's second "nul points" and second appearance in last place.
The song deals with Klimenko experiencing a very brief love affair and coming to the conclusion that the setting of the sun signals the end of "the time of love".
It was succeeded as Finnish representative at the 1966 Contest by Ann Christine with "Playboy".

<doc id="5958880" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5958880" title="K21">
K21

A replacement for the South Korean K200 series infantry fighting vehicles, formerly designated as K300 or XK21 KNIFV (Korea Next-generation Infantry Fighting Vehicle), is currently called the K21 NIFV. The initial production was set for 2008, with the Republic of Korea Army planning to field approximately 466 units. It is designed to effectively defeat other IFVs as heavily armed and armored as the BMP-3.
History.
Development began in 1999. A $77 million contract was awarded to Doosan DST for the NIFV prototype in 2003. Three prototype vehicles were delivered to the ROK Army in 2005. A contract for the first batch of K21 vehicles was signed in October 2008 worth $386.7 million. Production began in November 2009 after a ten-year development period. K21s will be deployed from 2013 through 2016.
Design.
Construction.
The K21 KNIFV's chassis is constructed entirely out of fiberglass, reducing the weight of the vehicle and enabling it to travel at higher speeds without bulky and powerful engines. The NIFV is to be lighter than other IFVs, including the American Bradley series, increasing both speed and payload.
The design was finally deemed production-ready in 2009, following 10 years in development and a research budget expenditure of approximately USD $80m. More than 85% of the vehicle's design is domestic. However a redesign is in order following the sinking of two vehicles while engaged in amphibious operations, a board of inquiry found that the problem was a lack of buoyancy, a malfunctioning wave plate and a technical problem with the drain pump, all of which will be corrected for in the new design.
Armaments.
The two-man turret on the K21 is armed with an S&T Dynamics K40 40 mm cannon capable of firing APFSDS, high-explosive, smoke and multipurpose munitions, and a 7.62 mm machine gun. This is combined with an advanced fire-control system and gun stabilizer usually found on third-generation main battle tanks that makes the K21, together with the German Puma, able to move and engage the targets with high degree of accuracy at the same time. The ammunition for the autocannon is stored under the turret.
The 40 mm cannon can fire up to 300 rounds per minute, with a projectile velocity of up to 1,005 m/s. The improved APFSDS rounds fired from it is able to penetrate up to 160–220 mm of armor, slightly higher than other APFSDS rounds, due to the self-sharpening process as the round penetrates the armour.
The multipurpose munition (한글: 복합기능탄) has several modes including proximity, air burst, armour-piercing and fragmentation. The mode is configured by the K21's FCS, which then transmits the necessary data to a small programmable fuse system inside the round before it is fired. This allows more control over the trajectory and impact of the round, expanding the scope of possible targets from medium armored vehicles to aircraft and infantry personnel.
Anti-tank armament includes an indigenous 3rd-generation ATGM, with performance similar to the Israeli Spike and armour penetration from 700 mm to 1,000 mm of RHA base.
Doosan DST and Belgian firm Cockerill have joined to develop the Cockerill XC-8 turret for the K21 to provide a medium weight direct fire capability. The XC-8 is based on the Cockerill CT-CV 105HP turret and is fitted with a 105 mm or 120 mm gun. The 105 mm version fires all NATO 105 mm ammunition and can also use the Cockerill Falarick 105 Gun-Launched Anti-Tank Guided Missile (GLATGM). It has a maximum elevation of 42 degrees, allowing for a max indirect fire range of . The 120 mm version fires all NATO 120 mm ammunition and can utilize the Cockerill Falarick 120 GLATGM. The missile can engage heavy armor beyond . Both turrets have a two-man crew and are autoloaded. They are digital, fully stabilised, day/night weapon systems.
Sensors.
The fire-control system is able to spot and track targets as far away as 6,000 meters away and identify them from up to 3,000 meters away. IFF sensors are also present. The vehicle also has hunter-killer capabilities with its separate commander's sight (IFV Commander's Panoramic Sight or ICPS) and gunner's sight (IFV Gunner's Primary Sight or IGPS), which can detect both ground and aerial targets. The sights are designed by Samsung Thales.
The gunner's sight is equipped with a third generation thermal viewer and a 1.54 μm laser range-finder. It can detect targets from 6,000 meters away and identify them from 3,000 meters away. The commander's sight is equipped with the same system as the gunner's. This allows the gunner to use the commander's sight to engage targets if his own sight is disabled or destroyed. The commander of the vehicle also has the ability to override the command to take control of the turret and gun from the gunner.
Armour.
Although not much is known about the composition of the K21's armour, the frontal armour of the vehicle is specifically designed to protect against large caliber automatic cannon rounds, primarily the 30 mm APDS munitions (30x165mm) for 2A72 automatic cannon used on BMP-3, which has approximately 50 mm armour penetration at ranges of 1,000 m. The side armour is designed to protect against 14.5 mm AP rounds, which has approximately 25 mm armour penetration at ranges of 1,000 m. The top can withstand fragments from 152 mm artillery shells exploding as close as 10 meters. Speculations have been made and it is assumed that the KNIFV has multiple layer armour (with S-2 glass fiber and ceramic complex) including lightweight aluminium alloy.
The vehicle has a soft self-sealing fuel tank that can absorb the impact of a projectile. There is also an automatic fire suppression system inside the vehicle to extinguish any internal fires that might erupt.
The K21 PIP will include an active protection suite and hard-kill anti-missile system similar to the AWiSS that will also be utilized for the K2 PIP. This will increase the vehicle's ability to defend itself against various ATGMs.
Troop deployment.
The K21 is able to carry a total of 9 passengers and 3 more vehicle crew members. With the Battle Management System, the vehicle crew and passengers inside the vehicle can be instantly notified about the environment around them, improving their situational awareness. A 15-inch screen is installed inside the passenger compartment, which provides various data from the BMS. The vehicle is mounted with an external CCD camera, and the passengers inside can survey the environment using the same screen.
Mobility.
The K21 is equipped with Doosan D2840LXE V-10 diesel engine, equipped with a turbocharger. The vehicle itself is approximately 25 tonnes which, combined with the total output of the engine, gives it a power/weight ratio of approximately 27 hp/t. The K21 PIP will feature an improved version of the engine that will give the vehicle an increased power of 840 hp.
A newly developed semi-active ISU, or In-arm Suspension Unit, is available for the K21. The same unit is to be used on the K2 Black Panther. Despite having the same ISU used on the K2 Black Panther, the K21 cannot change its posture.
The vehicle can travel on both land and water. "Pontoon System" gives more buoyancy to float on water when additional weight is put on to the vehicle.
Pricing.
The estimated cost of the vehicle is approximately US$3.67million(Updated in 2013)

Yotsuya, Tokyo

Geography.
Yotsuya is located in the southeastern part of Shinjuku. Prior to 1943, when Tokyo was still a city, Yotsuya was one of its wards and had definite boundaries, but it is less clearly defined today. Yotsuya is generally defined as coinciding with the responsibility area of the Shinjuku City Yotsuya Branch Office and the Yotsuya Police Station, which includes most of Shinjuku east of Meiji-dōri and south of Yasukuni-dōri. To the east lies the neighborhoods of Banchō in Chiyoda.
A place within Shinjuku, also named Yotsuya, is located immediately west of Yotsuya Station; it is divided into four "chōme".
History.
Before the growth of Edo, Yotsuya was a farming village outside the city. In 1634, with the digging of the outer moat around Edo Castle, many temples and shrines moved to Yotsuya. The moat had stone walls, and a "mitsuke," or watch tower, was also built. Yotsuya Mitsuke stood near the present-day Yotsuya Station.
The relocation of the temples and construction of the "mitsuke" brought settlements of workers, and following the devastating Meireki fire, many more people moved to Yotsuya, which had been spared. Gradually the area became part of the city of Edo.
In 1695, the shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi ordered the establishment of a vast kennel. The purpose was to board stray dogs as part of his policy of showing mercy to animals. The facility outside the Yotsuya Gate occupied .
Yotsuya developed rapidly due to its central location. In 1894, the Kōbu Railway, predecessor of the present-day Chūō Line, extended its existing railway line between Shinjuku and Tachikawa to Ushigome and opened Yotsuya and Shinanomachi stations. The railway enabled the easy transport of raw materials into the area; soon, pencil, tobacco and other industries moved in and began Yotsuya's rapid industrial development.
Culture.
Many historic temples and graves are located in Yotsuya. Among them are Sainen-ji, where the grave of the ninja Hattori Hanzō and his lance are interred.
Famous persons.
Prime Minister Saito Makoto lived in Yotsuya. He was assassinated at his home on February 26, 1936. This was one of the events of the February 26 Incident.
Other famous residents, past and present, include:
Yotsuya in fiction.
Yotsuya has figured prominently in various works of fiction. The kabuki play "Yotsuya Kaidan" took place there, as did the novel "Teisō Mondō" by Kan Kikuchi. Yotsuya was the setting for the Shōtarō Ikenami historical novel "Kenkaku Shōbai" and the "jidaigeki" television series based on it. It was also featured in the novel Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami.
The manga/anime series "Maison Ikkoku" has a supporting character named Yotsuya. It is unknown whether or not this is his real name.

List of Bristol Blenheim operators

The following are units which operated the Bristol Blenheim:
Operators.
Eight captured ex-Royal Yugoslav Air Force Mk I aircraft were acquired by the ZNDH from the Germans after the April invasion in 1941. Several survived to the end of the War, with one retreating to Klagenfurt Austria upon the collapse of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in May 1945.
Finland was the first export order for the Blenheim and 18 Mark Is were delivered between 29 July 1937 and 27 July 1938. A licence to local produce the aircraft was granted in April 1938 but none of the 15 ordered from State Aircraft Factory were delivered before the Russian invasion. Twelve new Mark IVs were diverted from RAF production and these were followed by 12 former RAF Mark Is.
The Hellenic Air Force in its campaigns against Italy and Germany in 1940 and 1941, operated 12 Mk IVs (delivered before WWII without sights, bomb racks, wireless radios and intercoms) and 6 Mk Is (delivered in February 1941). In the Middle East, the Hellenic Air Force operated 19 Mk IVs (from January 1942 till January 1943) and 31 Mk Vs (from January 1943 till September 1943). 
Blenheim Mk.IV N3589 of No. 40 Squadron RAF landed in error at Pantelleria on 13 September 1940 and was evaluated at Guidonia airfield near Rome. One more was captured in Yugoslavia while two were seized in Italian East Africa but were recaptured when this territory fell into British hands. N3589 might be the Mk.IV appearing in a non-flying role in the movie "Un Pilota Ritorna" (1942) directed by Roberto Rossellini.
Germany provided 6 captured ex-Royal Yugoslav Air Force Mk I aircraft to Romania in 1941, where they joined 12 Mk Is previously purchased from Britain.
The Royal Yugoslav Air Force acquired 24 Mk I aircraft from RAF stocks and subsequently undertook a licensed production run of some 36 aircraft. Tooling up for the production of the Mk IV was about to commence when interrupted by the Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. Some 20 partly completed airframes, as well as production tools and spare parts were subsequently sold by Germany to Finland.

An Acceptable Time

An Acceptable Time is a 1989 young adult science fiction novel by Madeleine L'Engle, the last of her books to feature Polyhymnia O'Keefe, better known as Poly ("The Arm of the Starfish", "Dragons in the Waters") or Polly ("A House Like a Lotus", "An Acceptable Time"). Marketed as part of the author's Time Quintet (the other four volumes of which are called the Time Quartet), "An Acceptable Time" connects Polly's adventures with those of her parents, Meg Murry and Calvin O'Keefe, which take place a generation earlier. The book's title is taken from Psalm 69:13, "But as for me, my prayer is to You, O Lord, at an acceptable time."
Plot Summary.
Happy to be away from her large family for a while, Polly O'Keefe is spending the autumn with her maternal grandparents, Dr. Kate Murry and Dr. Alex Murry, getting a better education from them in science than she would have received at home. She is grieving the loss of her beloved friend and mentor, Maximiliana Sebastiane Horne. Soon, however, surprising things start to happen, including the unexpected arrival of Zachary Gray, a charming but troubled college student whom Polly met in Greece and dated on Cyprus the year before (in "A House Like a Lotus").
Then, while walking near her grandparents' Connecticut home, Polly meets druids Karralys and Anaral and a warrior named Tav, all of whom lived in the area some three thousand years ago. She soon learns that she is not the first person from her time to meet the Murrys' Pre-Columbian neighbors. Bishop Nason Colubra, the brother of a family friend, Dr. Louise Colubra, has been investigating the hieroglyphs found on rocks in nearby, relics of Karralys' time. In doing so, he has also come into repeated contact with Anaral's tribe, the People of the Wind (a tribe that previously appeared in "A Swiftly Tilting Planet"). The retired bishop is initially reluctant to discuss this, having been met with his sister's skepticism in previous attempts. However, he feels responsible for exposing Polly to the potential dangers of a tesseract of intersecting periods of time.
The Murrys and the Colubras try to protect Polly from being drawn into the past, but although she tries to obey their restrictions on her movements, she continues to encounter Anaral and the others. Karralys and Tav formerly lived in ancient Britain, but have since crossed the ocean and made their home with the People of the Wind. On Samhain, Polly feels a compulsion to visit the Murrys' indoor swimming pool, the modern location of a site considered sacred by Karralys and Anaral. Polly is suddenly transported to the past, where she learns that Tav wants to offer Polly in blood sacrifice in order to avert a drought. Already the People Across the Lake are conducting raids due to the privations of drought, and Tav wants to protect his adopted people. Karralys sends Polly home.
Zachary, however, is intrigued when he learns that the odd people he has seen are from the ancient past. His heart, previously seen as damaged by rheumatic fever in the Austin family novel "The Moon by Night", is now so weak that he does not expect to live much longer. On the slight possibility that the solution to his problem lies with the ancient druids, Zach rashly leads Polly back to the star-watching rock, a place where Polly found herself in the past once before. Polly and Zach are drawn through a time gate and trapped in ancient Connecticut, with neither the Murrys nor Louise Colubra there to help Polly out of a potentially fatal situation. Tav soon changes his mind about whether his goddess wants Polly to be sacrificed. Her primary danger is not from the People of the Wind, but from their neighbors across the lake, where the drought is more severe.
The People Across the Lake conduct another raid, and leave behind two of their injured members as they withdraw. One of them, Klep, is expected to be his tribe's future leader. He develops an attachment to his healer, Anaral, and learns from Polly the concept of love. The other injured man, Brown Earth, persuades Zachary to cross the lake with him during the night. Tynak, the current leader of the People Across the Lake, promises to let the tribe's medicine man heal Zachary's heart if he helps bring Polly to them. Zach agrees. He participates in another raid, with Polly's capture as the goal. Polly tries to convince Zach that the People Across the Lake intend to sacrifice her for her blood, but he refuses to admit this. Polly escapes, but returns for Zachary's sake. Ultimately, Polly's spirit of self-sacrifice and love, accompanied by the timely return of rain on her captors' side of the lake, wins out as a better way to interact with the Divine than an offering of death. The two tribes agree to unite and help each other. Zachary repents his betrayal of Polly, and his heart is physically healed (at least in part) before they return to their own time. When they return Polly tells Zachary they shouldn't see each other any more.
Series notes.
Polly's grandparents, Kate and Alex Murry, were first introduced in "A Wrinkle in Time", the first book in the Time Quartet, but were not initially given first names. "A Wrinkle in Time", "A Wind in the Door" and "A Swiftly Tilting Planet" are primarily about Polly's mother, Meg Murry (later Meg Murry O'Keefe) in her teen years and young adulthood, and about Meg's brother Charles Wallace Murry. The other volume in the Time Quartet, "Many Waters", is about Polly's other uncles on her mother's side, Sandy and Dennys Murry. Together with the four books in which Polly appears, they are known as the Murry-O'Keefe books.
Crossover characters Canon Tallis (who was responsible for Polly's unusual first name), Zachary Gray, and Adam Eddington (who met "Poly" in "The Arm of the Starfish") connect the Polly O'Keefe books to Madeleine L'Engle's series about the Austin family. In "An Acceptable Time", Zachary makes specific reference to his desertion of Vicky Austin at the end of "A Ring of Endless Light".
"An Acceptable Time" is the continuation and culmination of both the Time Quartet and the O'Keefe series ("The Arm of the Starfish", "Dragons in the Waters" and "A House Like a Lotus"), with references to many places and events from previous books. Alex Murry's interest in the space/time continuum, which led to the events of "A Wrinkle in Time", is revisited in depth here. Kate Murry comments on her daughter Meg having had too low an opinion of herself, as seen in "A Wrinkle in Time" and "A Wind in the Door"; Kate's research in subcellular biology, a major component of "A Wind in the Door", is also mentioned repeatedly. The snake Louise the Larger and her human counterpart, Dr. Louise Colubra, both introduced in "A Wind in the Door", return in "An Acceptable Time". Sandy Murry is quoted as having said that "some things have to be believed to be seen", a lesson he learned in "Many Waters". There is also a reference to Kate Murry's lab being twice tampered with in the beginning of the book, clearly referencing the actions of Sandy and Dennys of "Many Waters", although the Murrys attribute the break-in to some "local kids". Last but not least, Polly's experience with the People of the Wind is consistent with Charles Wallace's interactions with the same tribe in "A Swiftly Tilting Planet".
As for Polly's own past adventures, she refers repeatedly to Gaea, her home in "The Arm of the Starfish", and mentions the Quiztano people from "Dragons in the Waters". "An Acceptable Time" takes place about six months after Polly's trip to Greece and Cyprus in "A House Like a Lotus". In the interim, her friend Max has died. and Polly is still grieving. It is implied that one of the reasons she has left fictional Benne Seed Island to study with her grandparents is that Max's death has left her with painful memories of her island home.

Characters of Dragon Prince

The Characters of Dragon Prince are fictional characters that appear in Melanie Rawn's Dragon Prince and Dragon Star trilogies.
Other major characters have special pages devoted to them, separate from this list. Please refer to them:
Heroes.
Walvis.
Over the years, they had two children, Jahnavi and Sionell. They also worked to fix up Remagev as Lord Hadaan had let it fall into some disrepair. In 714 Walvis became Lord of Remagev. By this time the Keep was fairly up to snuff, though not as luxurious as Radzyn or even Stronghold. By the time his children were married, Walvis and Feylin had an up and running Keep and Walvis was training the sons of Desert Lords in combat. Walvis became so adept at his training, that soon Lords and Princes from all over the Continent sent their sons to be trained by him.
During the "Vellanti" invasion Walvis - and many who had trained under him - fought at the High Prince's side. Without them, the war could have been lost.
Heroines.
Betheyn.
Betheyn was born in 707 and was the daughter of the chief architect rebuilding Feruche for Sorin. During this time Betheyn and Sorin developed a relationship, and later she apparently became his unofficial betrothed (her character is mentioned in Sunrunner's Fire, but is not named until Stronghold). By the year 737 Beth was living at Radzyn Keep with Tobin and Chay as their unofficial daughter-in-law. 
The "Vellanti" war broke out and Beth travelled with Prince Rohan and Pol across the Desert, helping Chayla with the injured whenever she could. Beth's knowledge of architecture also proved to be a great help. Myrdal - rumored sister of Zehava and keeper of the Desert's secret passageways - entrusted Beth, Hollis, Chayla, and Tobren with the secrets of the Desert's Keeps. Hollis' Sunrunner memory enabled her to remember every detail exactly, Chayla and Tobren were of Zehava's blood, and Beth would understand the architecture and technical workings of the passageways.
Isriam, Rohan's squire, travelled with Beth and the others. Though only sixteen, he grew up quickly due to the war and became Beth's main proector. The two felt a romantic connection despite the rather large age difference (Beth was thirty). As the war progressed Isriam aided Beth in her architectural endeavors. This deepened their feelings for one another, though neither acted upon their feelings for quite a while. At the end of the war, Beth and Isriam admitted their feelings for each other. Isriam, however, saw himself as too young and thought that Beth's feelings had been influenced by the war and danger, not true affection. Beth disagreed, kissed him, and told him that he wouldn't always be young.
Sionell.
Sionell of Remagev, Regent of Cunaxa, born in 708, was the oldest child of Walvis and Feylin, and a little hellion. Stubborn to a fault, she had the lucky place of being the thorn in young Pol's side. She wanted to follow him everywhere. He wanted nothing to do with a little 'baby' as he called her. Sionell would stomp her little foot and say she wasn't a baby. As all people do, Sionell grew up. She grew into a strong and hot-tempered young woman, and very opinionated to boot, but she was also kindhearted and caring. She had always been half in love with Pol and as she got older that love grew too. Pol, for his part, viewed her more as a kid sister than anything else. Another young man noticed the beautiful woman she had become, however. His name was Tallain of Tiglath. He was a shy and quiet young man, but he was a strong one too. He came out of his shell, in part due to his relationship with Sionell and she matured with grace due to his. The two found love and were eventually married, though Sionell never forgot her first love, Pol. Sionell and Tallain had three children together, Antalya, Jahnev and Meig.
Tiglath was one of the first Keeps attacked during the "Vellanti" invasion. They came without warning, killing everyone in their path. Tallain shouted for Sionell to take the children and get to safety. With tears in her eyes she did so, though she longed to stand beside her husband and defend her home. Tallain and his men were able to fend off the invaders long enough for Sionell and others to get away, but he and the brave defenders of Tiglath had fallen.
Sionell was a great asset during the war. She helped plan against further attacks, and took part in Sioned's scheme to drug the "Vellanti" soldiers - she did not know the drug was actually poison; however, and wasn't terribly pleased when she discovered it. Many times during the war she would speak to Pol, trying to keep him focused and on track. He needed her to yell him into actions on a few occasions. In the end, Pol and his forces won the war and drove the "Vellant'im" from the Continent. Pol also finally saw Sionell as a strong woman and not the little girl who had followed him around, pestering him. Following Meiglan's death at the hands of the "Vellant'im", she and Pol were romantically involved for a brief encounter. It was too little too late, though. Sionell, while she still cared deeply for him and perhaps even loved him, couldn't help but to remember Tallain's selfless bravery and unfaltering love. Instead of staying with Pol, Sionell accepted the Regency of Cunaxa.
Villains.
Masul.
His chance came before the "Rialla" of 719. His aunt, who was in the service of Lady Kiele of Waes, told him that her mistress wished to meet him and, if she believed Masul was her brother, she would sponsor him at the "Rialla". Masul went to Waes. 
At the "Rialla", he challenged Pol's right to Princemarch, claiming it as his own through blood. As Roelstra's barge had gone up in flames all those years ago and there were in fact two babies on board, Masul's claim could not be discarded out of hand. Then a man named Gernius came forward, claiming that Masul was his son. Gernius, who had been a member of Roelstra's barge crew, was tall with black hair, green eyes, and had facial features similar to Masul's. Before High Prince Rohan could question the man, Gernius was killed by a man pretending to be a "Merida". The debate about Masul's parentage continued, this time without evidence to gainsay the claim. That being said, Masul had murdered an itinerant Sunrunner; his life was already forfeit. 
After being knighted by Prince Miyon of Cunaxa, Masul challenged Pol to a duel, but Pol, being only fourteen and not yet knighted, was unable to fight. Maarken, his older cousin, fought Masul in his place. In a fair fight Maarken would have won, but sorcery assaulted him, blurring his vision with shapes of phantom warriors. Masul toyed with Maarken, knocking him around as he tried to fight dozens of shadowed enemies. Masul was about to kill him, when Rohan intervened; Rohan killed him with two well-thrown daggers.
Miyon.
Miyon, Prince of Cunaxa, was born in 689. He became the Prince of Cunaxa at twelve years of age as his father had died of plague. Miyon was raised into his princehood by an uncle with known "Merida" ties. The young Prince struggled for many years to shake off the chains of his advisors' rule. Miyon did not attend the gathering at Stronghold to affirm Princes, "athr'im", and to accept Rohan as High Prince, claiming an illness instead. 
As Miyon grew older, he wrested Cunaxa from his uncle's control. He ruled his Princedom as he see fit, with an iron fist unless the "Merida" were involved. Over the years he had many bastard children - he never married - including Meiglan. Miyon used Meiglan as a trap for Pol, much as Roelstra had used his, albeit legitimate, daughters against Rohan. The difference is, this time the trap was sprung. Meiglan was innocent and ignorant of her father's plotting and Pol fell in love with her. He wanted to protect her and care for her and be her golden hero. He married her. Miyon, of course, was thrilled. His plans didn't turn out as grand as he had hoped; however, he was not very welcome at Dragon's Rest, Pol and Meiglan's home. This angered him, and by the time the "Vellant'im" attacked he bore no love for his daughter. He kidnapped Meiglan and his granddaughter, Rislyn, and took them to the "Vellant'im" High Warlord. For his crimes, Miyon is later killed by Andry, Lord of Goddess Keep.
"Vellanti" High Warlord.
There was little known about the "Vellant'im High Warlord" other than the fact he wanted to rule the Desert. He had about five wives and a bushel of sons back in his homeland. He did not view women very highly, though he respected - to some extent - a few, including the "Azhreia", Sioned, of whom he'd heard many tales. He was mightily impressed that she had set Stronghold ablaze, burning the Keep to the ground rather than letting him or his men use it. He also seemed fixated on her hair, as if he had never seen its color before. He came to respect Meiglan a little - or at least not to discount her out of hand - when he realized what she had been sewing into her husband's funeral blanket. When Ruala approached him to give him the use of Skybowl, he dismissed her until he learned that she was pregnant, then he was nearly coddling her; after all she could be carrying her husband's son.
The "Vellanti" High Warlord was clever and cunning in his battle tactics. His attacks were swift and precise. He knew his enemy and where to strike to do the most damage. He had nearly won the entire Continent and had taken over most of the Desert, where the new High Prince, Pol, awaited to make his final stand. In the end, the High Warlord underestimated Pol, Andry, and all of their allies. Before he was defeated' however, he killed Meiglan. Pol killed him and drove the "Vellant'im" from the land.

John of Matha

Saint John of Matha was a Christian saint of the 12th century and founder of the Order of the Most Holy Trinity, dedicated to ransoming captive Christians.
Background.
Between the eighth and the fifteenth centuries medieval Europe was in a state of ongoing war with the expanding Moslem world. Christians took up arms to defend against the advance of Mohammed’s disciples. Arabs successfully managed to subjugate North Africa, most of Spain, Southern France and took over Sicily making the Mediterranean, previously a Roman lake, now a Moslem one. In Christian lands, in the daily conflicts of this secular struggle, Saracens plundered all that could be transported: animals, provisions, fabrics, precious metals, money and especially men, women and children who would be sold for a good price. Privateering and piracy on the Mediterranean sea were aggressive and violent means used by Moslems to harass their Christian enemies and, above all, to obtain large profits and easy gains. For over six hundred years, these constant armed confrontations produced numerous war prisoners on both sides. Islam’s captives were reduced to the state of slaves since they were war booty and submitted to the absolute dominion of their Moorish owners. Such was the condition of countless Christians in the Southern European countries.
The threat of capture, whether by pirates or coastal raiders, or during one of the region's intermittent wars, was not a new but rather a continuing threat to the residents of Catalonia, Languedoc, and the other coastal provinces of medieval Christian Europe.
The redemption of captives is listed among the corporal works of mercy. The period of the Crusades, when so many Christians were in danger of falling into the hands of non-Christians, witnessed the rise of religious orders vowed exclusively to this pious work. 
Life.
John was born to pious, noble parents at Faucon-de-Barcelonnette, on the borders of Provence on June 23, 1169. He was baptized John, in honour of St. John the Baptist. His father Euphemius sent him to Aix, where he learned grammar, fencing, riding, and other exercises fit for a young nobleman. While there he gave the poor a considerable part of his money his parents sent him, and he visited the hospital every Friday, assisting the poor sick. 
He studied theology at the University of Paris was ordained a priest at the age of 32 in December 1192. According to Trintarian tradition, on January 28, 1193, John celebrated his first Mass. During that Mass, he was struck with a vision of Christ holding by the hand two chained captives, one a Moor, the other a Christian (the Crusades were in full force at the time). The Christian captive carried a staff with a red and blue cross. After the Mass, John decided to devote himself to the task of ransoming Christian captives from the Moors. Before entering upon this work, he thought it needful to spend some time in retirement, prayer, and mortification; and having heard of a holy hermit, St. Felix of Valois, living in a great wood near Gandelu, in the diocese of Meux, he repaired to him and requested him to instruct him in the practice of perfection. 
One day while walking with Felix, John had another vision – a white stag appeared at a stream with a red and blue cross between its antlers. John disclosed to Felix the design he had conceived on the day on which he said his first mass, to succour captive Christians under slavery, and Felix offered his help in carrying it out. They set out for Rome in the midst of a severe winter, towards the end of the year 1197, to obtain the pope's benediction.
On December 17, 1198, he obtained the preliminary approval of Pope Innocent III for a new order dedicated in honour of the Blessed Trinity for the redemption of Christian captives. This order was fully approved in 1209. The Order of the Most Holy Trinity's first monastery was established at Cerfroid (just north of Paris) and the second at Rome at the church of San Tommaso in Formis. Christian slaves were first rescued by the Order in 1201. In 1202 and 1210 John travelled to Tunisia himself and brought back countless Christian slaves.
Before his death, Trinitarian tradition says he met St. Francis of Assisi and introduced Francis to the Frangipani family, one of the benefactors of the Franciscan order. St. John of Matha died on December 17, 1213 in Rome in the house of St. Thomas In Formis on the Caelian Hill. 
Our Lady of Good Remedy.
St. John founded the Trinitarians to go to the slave markets, buy the Christian slaves and set them free. To carry out this plan, the Trinitarians needed large amounts of money. So, they placed their fund-raising efforts under the patronage of Mary. In gratitude for her assistance, St. John of Matha honored Mary with the title of "Our Lady of Good Remedy." Devotion to Mary under this ancient title is widely known in Europe and Latin America, and the Church celebrates her feast day on October 8. Our Lady of Good Remedy is often depicted as the Virgin Mary handing a bag of money to St. John of Matha. 
Veneration.
In 1655, his relics were transferred from Rome to Madrid. His cultus was approved in 1665 and his feast day is December 17.
Legacy.
The Order of the Most Holy Trinity is active on five continents and in many countries.
DeMatha Catholic High School located in Hyattsville, Maryland, U.S. is named after him. It is also sponsored by the Trinitarians.
In 1865 American poet John Greenleaf Whittier composed an anti-slavery poem entitled "The Mantle of St. John De Matha".

Spring Gulch

Spring Gulch is a cross-country ski area located on Thompson Creek Road in northwestern Pitkin County, Colorado, six miles west of Carbondale, Colorado, USA. The area is run by the non-profit Mount Sopris Nordic Council for the benefit of community members and visitors. Use of the area is free of cost and limited to cross-country skiing activities.
The terrain consists primarily of rolling trails among gambel oak and aspen trees. The area was formed in cooperation with the local cattlemen's association, which owns the land and uses it for summer grazing. Notable annual events include the Ski for Sisu fundraiser, the Alpine Bank Classic high school Junior Olympic qualifiers, and the Colorado Rocky Mountain School Rat Race.
Spring Gulch is the primary training ground for the Nordic team at CRMS.

Space Shuttle America

Space Shuttle America (also known as Space Shuttle America - The Next Century) was a motion simulator ride at the Six Flags Great America theme park in Gurnee, Illinois, that opened in 1994. The ride's main feature was a full-scale replica of an American Space Shuttle orbiter. It closed permanently after the 2007 season and was removed in December 2009.
Storyline.
The storyline of the ride was that riders have boarded a new Space Shuttle called "America", which is capable of transporting passengers to the fictional Armstrong City using the LRVM (Lunar Run Velocity Management) Warp. Armstrong City is located a short distance from the site of the first manned moon landing. 
Guests entered a building that has a small replica of Launch Control at Cape Canaveral. Several TV screens display fake NASA TV recordings about the shuttle and security cam views of the fictional facility that attendees are supposedly touring. Shortly before boarding there is a notice about a meteor that is coming near Earth.
In the movie, the shuttle takes off horizontally and the Pas-Com (Passenger Compartment) rises out of the cargo bay so you can do some orbital sightseeing. The shuttle passes Space Shuttle "Destiny", which is doing some cleanup work around the atmosphere. Next the shuttle passes an HBO satellite and the fictional Space Station Freedom 3. The shuttle then makes its way away from Earth and enters LRVM warp and exits a short distance from the moon. The shuttle then flies over the Sea of Tranquility and over Armstrong City. Shortly before landing in the city an alert is sent to the shuttle crew ordering them to investigate a meteor danger in the area. The shuttle, not even getting a chance to land, takes off again towards an asteroid belt. "America" is then hit by an asteroid and is now fighting to survive in the asteroid field. "America" begins blasting asteroids with its 'particle beam' (laser). The shuttle then spots the meteor and is alerted it is heading on a direct course to Earth. Unable to destroy it from a distance, the shuttle flies through a canyon and a cave and destroys it from the inside. The shuttle, now crippled, heads immediately back towards the LRVM and warps back to Earth. The hydraulics for the Pas-Com then malfunction just as the shuttle begins Earth re-entry but they come down just before re-entry. The shuttle lands and the ride ends.
The events take place in 2094.
The movie was shown for a short while at Six Flags Over Texas, and was made by DreamQuest Images.
Shuttle.
Outside the building that houses the queue and the ride itself is a fiberglass mock-up of a Space Shuttle orbiter that has authentic "tiles" used in actual space shuttle orbiters. The shuttle was built to the exact scale of the real STS craft, but is neither an official NASA shuttle nor capable of spaceflight.
Other movies.
The building that shows Space Shuttle America also showed:
Removal.
High operating costs and dwindling popularity doomed Space Shuttle America and its final operating season was 2007. For the following time period when the ride was closed, the interior was used as a temporary office/storage by employees. The shuttle and building were finally removed in December 2009. After plans to build a roller coaster on the site were canceled, the park expanded Hurricane Harbor into the area for the 2011 season.

Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda

Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda is National Treasure of Korea No. 86. It was designated by the South Korean government on December 20, 1962. 
An inscription on the first story of the pagoda states that it was erected in the fourth year of King Chungmok in 1348. The pagoda was first placed at the now-lost Gyeongcheonsa Temple which sat at the foot of Mt. Buso in Gwangdeok-myeon, Gaepung-gun, Gyeonggi-do Province. During the Japanese occupation of Korea, the pagoda was taken to Japan. In 1960, the pagoda was returned and placed on the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Today, the pagoda stands in one of the main halls of the National Museum of Korea.
The pagoda stands 13 m in height and is ten storeys tall. However, because of the three-tiered foundation, it is a common mistake to believe that the pagoda has thirteen storeys. Unlike most Goryeo-era pagodas, this pagoda is made from marble. The preferred material of Korean sculptors was generally granite. The later Joseon-era Wongaksa Pagoda is stylistically very similar and is believed to have been heavily influenced by the Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda.
Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda sits on a three-tiered foundation which projects in four directions like a cross. The first three storeys of the pagoda share the same shape as the foundation. Each panel of this tiered foundation is carved with Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, flowers, and arabesque patterns. 
The remaining storeys are square in shape and share intricate detailing which tries to create the illusion that the marble pagoda is made from wood. Each remaining storey has railings, a hip-and-gabled roof, eaves, and carvings made to suggest that each roof is tiled.
The pagoda is valuable because it preserves the Goryeo-era wooden architectural style that has been mostly lost. According to the South Korean Cultural Heritage Administration, the pagoda is one of the finest examples of Korean stone work and is of high artistic value.

Varjoon – suojaan

"Varjoon - suojaan" ("To shadow - to safety") was the Finnish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1967, performed in Finnish by Fredi.
The song was performed eighth on the night, following Sweden's Östen Warnerbring with "Som en dröm" and preceding Germany's Inge Brück with "Anouschka". At the close of voting, it had received 3 points, placing 12th in a field of 17.
The song is about Fredi's desire to escape from the hustle and bustle of life, to the shadow of anonymity. He remarks that he knows it will be lonely there, but that he feels that he will be happier regardless.
It was succeeded as Finnish representative at the 1968 Contest by Kristina Hautala with "Kun kello käy". Fredi returned to the Contest in 1976 with the song "Pump-Pump".

Plot.
Summary.
The Jane Does.
Colonel William Rawls questions detective Lester Freamon and Bunk Moreland about their case. He tells Freamon he has been detailed to the Southeastern district and recommends that Bunk bring in a fresh detective.
Bunk, Beadie Russell, Ray Cole and Mackey serve grand jury summons on checkers at Frank Sobotka's union who worked on the Atlantic Light, the ship that delivered the container that the dead girls were found in, including Johnny "Fifty" Spamanto and Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa. Sobotka is enraged that the detectives believe he knew anything about the girls.
The grand jury prosecutor informs Bunk that the hearings brought little information. Out of options, Bunk quizzes Russell about informants in the docks and is disappointed when she has none. Later, Russell visits an old flame in Sobotka’s union named Maui. She sounds him out about becoming an informant while he tries to reinitiate their relationship. He refuses to give her information on his fellow union men but offers a tip – the union computers may be useful in tracking containers.
McNulty.
Bubbles visits the marine unit to find Jimmy McNulty. McNulty is out on a boat and Claude Diggins radios him to return to shore. Bubbles reports that he has tracked down Omar Little. McNulty gives him some money and Bubbles persuades him to give him more after he rants about how dangerous the task of locating Omar for him was.
McNulty brings Omar in to be interviewed by ASA Ilene Nathan in preparation for the upcoming Marquis "Bird" Hilton trial. Nathan is surprised at Omar’s candor and history, but she calls him a sociopath and worries about putting him on the stand in front of Maurice Levy. She gives McNulty a voucher to buy Omar some more appropriate clothes for a court appearance (saying that he should get something "with a tie").
Omar shops for clothes. McNulty visits the federal building (where the Immigration and Naturalization Service office is being converted to a Department of Homeland Security office) and asks Special Agent Cleary if he can interview any vice suspects to try and interview them about the girl he found in the harbor. Cleary finds some girls being held in New Jersey, but finds it hard to understand McNulty’s desire to ID the girl.
Sobotka detail.
Lieutenant Cedric Daniels meets with Sergeant Ellis Carver to offer him a position in the detail. Carver cannot understand why Daniels would consider him after he betrayed him when they worked together on the Barksdale case (as revealed in the final episode of season 1). Daniels tells him that he thinks he will not try anything similar as he has caught him once before. His condition for Carver is that he will not be recognized as a sergeant and will report to detective Kima Greggs. Thomas "Herc" Hauk is overjoyed to be working with his old partner again.
Daniels briefs his new men. He orders DNRs and finance investigations to be done quickly to placate Major Valchek. He puts Greggs, Herc and Carver on drug trade around the port and Herc is pleased that he might get to do some undercover work for once as the port dealers are largely white. Freamon arrives and impresses the detail by recognizing a photo of Sobotka – he tells them of the link to the Jane Does case.
Major Valchek receives another photo of his missing surveillance van at a port in San Diego and dusts it for fingerprints. Greggs asks him about using the van and he tells her it is "on loan to the Southwest," an allusion to the southwestern part of the country.
Greggs, Carver and Herc begin making hand-to-hands around the port. Greggs and Carver set up a surveillance post in a vacant apartment. Carver watches Frog berate another dealer for spending too much time with his girlfriend. Greggs is annoyed that Herc is taking a long time to prepare. Herc arrives and shows off his props to his colleagues. They find the dealers in the port area much less organized than their old targets in the Barksdale organization.
Barksdale trade.
Donette visits D'Angelo Barksdale with their son Tyrell and tells him that Stringer Bell has been supporting her and has plans to look after D'Angelo when he is released. D'Angelo is cynical about their motivations and tells Donette it is about business.
In the "Pit", an addict disparages the drugs sold to him and Poot Carr tries to restrain his dealers from beating the man. Puddin calls Bodie Broadus over from his tower. Bodie realizes that the problem is with their product’s low quality and says that someone needs to tell Stringer. 
Stringer attends his economics class at the Baltimore Community College and asks his teacher, Mr. Lucas, for advice about selling an inferior product in a competitive marketplace (without revealing that his product is heroin). Lucas tells him to decrease prices to increase market share, possibly even operating at a loss. He warns Stringer that the product will lose credibility if the price is continually low, and mentions the case of Worldcom's name change to escape low consumer credibility. Stringer meets with Donette at home and she reports D’Angelo’s troubled state of mind. 
Stringer visits the prison and discusses the problems with their product with Avon. He tells him that the East side dealers Proposition Joe and Petey Dixon have the best product. Stringer asks about D'Angelo and Avon says he has to "find his own way". Stringer suggests that they put some property in D'Angelo's name to give him something to come home to. Avon tells Stringer that D'Angelo has taken a lot on for them. Stringer assures him that he has been fair.
Stringer hosts a meeting with many Barksdale dealers, opening with the remark "You have all heard of WorldCom?" and soliciting ideas to solve the organization's problem. Poot calls for a name change, Shamrock proposes different color caps for the drug vials and Bodie Broadus suggests dividing up the towers to create a fake competition.
Dock business.
A white dealer called Frog makes sales in the Eastside. Ziggy Sobotka arrives to collect money from him. Frog's count is short and he tells Ziggy that the stash was stolen. Ziggy threatens him but Frog remains indifferent. As Ziggy goes to drive away he is blocked in. Eastside lieutenant Melvin "Cheese" Wagstaff harasses Ziggy for the money he owes him. Cheese is far more effective at intimidating Ziggy than Ziggy was with Frog. Ziggy offers his new leather jacket as partial payment but Cheese is unimpressed. Cheese has his men beat Ziggy and they take his car, telling him that if they have not been paid by Friday he will be dead on Saturday. Frog is on hand to see the whole encounter.
Nick Sobotka views a house with his girlfriend Aimee. Elena McNulty is the realtor. He argues with her about the area name. The asking price seems beyond Nick’s means; Aimee suggests that they rent somewhere.
At Delores' bar, Ziggy relates his problems to Nick, who chastises him for getting involved with drugs. Nick refuses to help Ziggy initially but when he realizes Ziggy is in danger and has no other way out he tells Ziggy he has already given his share of their takings stealing from the docks to Aimee for an apartment.
At The Greek's café Nick reports the summons to Sergei "Serge" Malatov and Spiros "Vondas" Vondopoulos and requests that they put their smuggling on hold on behalf of Frank Sobotka. Vondas assures Nick that the Jane Doe investigation will find only dead ends. Nick tells them that Frank wants to meet with The Greek himself. Vondas asks Nick about smuggling chemicals, Nick asks what they would be used for and Vondas tells them that it is just business. 
Nick and La La visit Cheese to negotiate Ziggy’s debt. Nick asks for the car back so that Ziggy can sell it to raise the money. Cheese offers another week and shows Nick that they have torched Ziggy’s car. La La drives Nick to give the bad news to Ziggy. 
The Greek discusses the police investigation with Vondas. The Greek refuses to meet with Sobotka but tells Vondas to double his payment. Sobotka is dismissive of the offer and angry that The Greek would not meet with him. Vondas points out the closed steel factories, leaving Frank to ponder the fate of his union if he cuts his ties to The Greek.
Ziggy and Nick look up the chemicals that Vondas asked them to obtain on a library PC. They find that they are used for processing cocaine. Nick confronts Sergei and Vondas assuring them that he is happy to deal as long as the chemicals are only used for narcotics and not, as he feared, for explosives or weaponry. They tell him that they will triple their payment if Frank agrees to continue working with them, but Frank is defiant when confronted with the offer the following morning.

<doc id="5959055" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5959055" title="Harpactirinae">
Harpactirinae

Harpactirinae (commonly called baboon spiders) are a subfamily of tarantulas which are native to the continent of Africa. Like many tarantulas, they have a strong venom, and can inflict a painful bite; however most baboon spiders are not considered dangerous to humans.
Description.
Harpactirinae are ground-dwelling spiders who build silk-lined burrows, often under debris such as stones, using their fangs and chelicerae for digging. Habitats include savanna woodlands, grasslands, and dry scrublands. 
Systematics.
The following genera and species are present in Harpactirinae. In addition, the genus "Brachionopus" (Pocock, 1897) has been suggested for placement in this sub-family, but its taxonomy is currently disputed.
"Augacephalus" (Gallon, 2002)
Type species: "Augacephalus breyeri"
In synonymy:
"Augacephalus nigrifemur" (Schmidt, 1995) = "Augacephalus junodi"
"Bacillochilus" (Gallon, 2010) 
"Brachionopus" (Pocock, 1897)
To quote Platnick's World Spider Catalog v. 12.5, "N.B.: transferred here from the Barychelidae by Raven, 1985a: 112; Brachyonopus is an unjustified emendation; Raven's transfer was not accepted by Charpentier, 1993: 5 or Schmidt, 2002a: 12 and 2008: 3, who nevertheless identified no close relatives of the genus among the known barychelids; Gallon, 2002: 204 argued for its inclusion in the Barychelidae but indicated that it "does not fit in any current barychelid subfamily" but later (Gallon, 2010b: 79) considered it a harpactirine.".
In other words, it's taxonomy is in dispute and the many recent workers do not consider it a theraphosid. All are found in South Africa.

Production.
Title reference.
The episode title refers to D'Angelo's comment that all of a person's life is an unchanging prologue to their current situation. It also underscores the divide between the first and second halves of the season, when consequences of actions come more sharply into focus.
Epigraph.
D'Angelo makes this comment when discussing F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel "The Great Gatsby" and the theme of Gatsby's inability to escape his past and who he was no matter how much he tried to cover it, a sentiment that D'Angelo shares as he is unable to escape that he is a Barksdale. It also refers to Jimmy McNulty's attempts at reconciliation with his wife.

Plot.
Gant trial.
Omar Little solves a crossword clue for the bailiff as he awaits his appearance in court. When he is called, he answers honestly about his occupation as ASA Ilene Nathan questions him. Omar is quick to identify Marquis "Bird" Hilton, stating that they served prison time together. Bird's attorney Maurice Levy objects to the reference to Bird's previous convictions and it is stricken from the record. Omar identifies Bird's weapon and insults Bird, saying he was too stupid to dispose of it. Bird flies into a rage and has to be restrained as Judge Phelan calls for order. As they observe the trial, Stringer Bell tells Jimmy McNulty that word on the street is that Omar was nowhere near the crime scene; McNulty reminds Stringer that the word on the street is not worth anything in a court of law.
Levy cross-examines Omar and asks if his testimony is part of a deal with the police. Levy reads Omar's arrest record, including a charge for attempted murder. Omar explains away the charge, saying that he deliberately shot a drug dealer named Mike Mike in the "hind parts" with no intent to kill, drawing an amused reaction from the jury. Levy is incredulous about Omar's career and characterizes him as a violent criminal. Levy claims that Omar would have killed Gant himself if he needed to – an assertion that Omar flatly denies; maintaining that he wouldn't kill a citizen who wasn't in the "game." Levy continues on, describing Omar as a parasite living off the drug culture. Omar jumps upon this comment and compares himself to Levy – both live off the drug trade, Omar through his shotgun and Levy through his briefcase. The courtroom reacts in shock; Nathan and Judge Phelan are both thrilled with Omar's performance under cross-examination. Levy is unable to further discredit Omar as a witness after his own credibility is diminished in front of the jury.
When the jury returns a guilty verdict, Levy protests claiming that Omar's testimony was fabricated on a deal with the police department, and calls for an appeal bond. Judge Phelan shows little mercy for Bird, claiming that there will be no appeal bond unless evidence is presented proving Bird is Jesus Christ come back to earth. Phelan then states that the presentence report will be a formality and claims that Bird will serve life without parole. After the trial, Nathan gives Omar her card and offers him a "get out of jail free" pass on any charge up to and including aggravated assault. On his way out of the courthouse, Bird threatens Omar's life while Omar tells Bird to remember Brandon, Omar's dead lover, while serving his sentence.
Sobotka detail.
Lieutenant Cedric Daniels reviews the information that his detail has gathered so far. Lester Freamon reports that Frank Sobotka lives within his means, while the union books show a decline in membership and difficulty meeting their debts. Roland "Prez" Pryzbylewski and Freamon describe a paper trail through campaign finance records linking the union to $70,000 in contributions. Thomas "Herc" Hauk reports that they have had success making street level hand-to-hands but have established no ties so far between drug dealers and the union. Beadie Russell suggests that the union is making extra money by facilitating smuggling in and out of the port. Daniels introduces Russell and Bunk Moreland and explains their co-operation with the detail over their Jane Doe homicides. Daniels reassigns Kima Greggs and Prez to focus on the vice trade, and Freamon to work with Russell and Bunk looking at container movements. Herc asks Russell out on a date and she declines. Ellis Carver mocks Herc.
Greggs meets with Shardene Innes to ask for help tracking down Eastern European girls working in the vice trade. Shardene is now living with Freamon and attending nursing school. Later Greggs discusses her strip club assignment with Cheryl. Cheryl is jealous and angry that Greggs has returned to detective work, and insists on accompanying Greggs. Prez is also roped into visiting the clubs and seems uncomfortable, refusing to look directly at any of the strippers. Shardene's friend is only too willing to help, because her earnings are threatened by the imported girls. She tells the detectives that there is a madam who organizes the girls and that their pay is low, so they undercut local dancers. The girls are kept in a motel and driven back and forth to work and they are carefully guarded and prevented from becoming close with their customers. After visiting the club, Greggs takes Cheryl to the port and explains how the girls died.
Russell shows Bunk and Daniels how to use computers to track container movements. She warns them that it will require long hours of surveillance. The tedium of the surveillance work sends Bunk to the bar early. Bunk drinks with McNulty and tells him that he thinks Colonel William Rawls expects him to clear the cases or he will force him out of the unit. McNulty tears up the photo of the dead girl he has been carrying since he found her body, telling Bunk he is done pretending to be a detective and that he is going to make another go of things with Elena. 
The next day, Russell and Freamon report their findings to Daniels while Bunk struggles through a terrible hangover. They have linked all of the missing containers to Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa. Daniels is still reluctant to fold the Jane Doe murders into his investigation despite the link through Horseface.
McNulty.
McNulty visits his wife's real estate business and amuses her by undressing the store mannequin while she talks to clients. He asks her to come to dinner with him; despite her initial reluctance, he talks her into it. While working on the marine unit, McNulty continues to be troubled by the dead girl he pulled from the harbor.
At their dinner Elena parries McNulty's attempts to rekindle their relationship by propositioning him for sex. The next morning, as McNulty relaxes and reads the paper, Elena asks him to leave before their sons see him and think the family is back together.
The Greeks.
Nick Sobotka meets with Spiros "Vondas" Vondopoulos and his drug lieutenant Eton Ben-Eleazer to discuss the chemicals. Nick asks for help with Ziggy’s problems with Cheese. Vondas offers to kill Cheese and Nick says that he is not looking for a war and that Ziggy is in the wrong. Vondas calls Nick smart and Nick takes the opportunity to ask for muscle to talk to Cheese.
Nick accompanies Sergei "Serge" Molatov to a meeting with Cheese and is dismayed when Serge draws a firearm. Serge reports that he has negotiated with Cheese and that he will talk to Proposition Joe to compensate Ziggy Sobotka for Cheese destroying his car. Serge arranges a meeting with Proposition Joe at his electronics shop. When Serge vouches for Nick, Joe agrees to compensate Ziggy. Proposition Joe makes it clear that Ziggy and Nick would both be dead if not for their association with the Greeks. At the same time, Joe is somewhat understanding of Nick's situation realizing that problematic family members such as Ziggy occur in almost every family including Joe's.
Nick delivers the chemicals to Eton and Vondas; they offer to pay him with drugs. Nick opts to take half the payment in cash and the rest in drugs. Nick refuses to let Ziggy get involved with the package after the trouble he caused with the last one. Their accomplice Johnny "Fifty" Spamanto is on hand to drive home with them.
Union business.
Frank Sobotka chairs a meeting with his union about their political aims. Nat Coxson is skeptical about the usefulness of dredging the canal and their chances of restarting the grain pier. Also in attendance are Horseface, Little Big Roy, Moonshot, Chess and Ott amongst others. Nat urges the checkers to start to contact their legislators. After the meeting Nat tells Frank that he knows he must be getting money from another source and warns him to be careful.
At Delores's bar Frank buys a round and Little Big Roy and Horseface tell stories. Nick arrives to give Ziggy his compensation. Ziggy immediately buys a round for the bar and burns some of the money. Frank leaves the bar, disgusted with Ziggy’s actions. Outside he asks Ziggy how he got the bruises, still visible from the beating Cheese gave him, Ziggy lies and says he fell over. He questions Ziggy about where he is getting money from. He tells Ziggy perhaps he should have gone to community college with his brother. Ziggy reminisces about his childhood – his memories focus entirely on the docks, his father and the union.
Prison and Barksdale business.
Stringer Bell delivers an envelope of cash to Leech, a contact from Washington D.C. He is there to organize a contract killing and insists that it must not be traceable to him.
D'Angelo Barksdale flushes his remaining drugs down his cell toilet. He attends a book group in the prison library and discusses F. Scott Fitzgerald’s "The Great Gatsby". D’Angelo offers a sophisticated analysis of the novel asserting that a person can never escape his past, no matter what fronts he attempts to establish.
Brianna visits D'Angelo and tries to persuade him to use Avon's set-up of CO Tilghman to shave time from his sentence. He refuses, saying that Avon's actions were evil. He reminds his mother that she taught him to stand up for himself from an incident when he was younger where she forced him to fight twins that were picking on him rather than let him in the house. He then reminds his mother that he learned to take responsibility from that incident and refuses to try to get out of prison given what she taught him and her forcing of him to take the majority of the drug charges for the Barksdale Organization. He then asks her to tell Stringer, Avon and Donette to leave him alone. D'Angelo passes Avon in the corridor and refuses to talk to him.
While working in the prison library, D'Angelo is assaulted and strangled to death with a belt by another inmate named Mugs. Mugs positions the body and hands so that it appears to be a suicide by hanging.
Reception.
Omar Little's courtroom scene in this episode has been described as the character's "defining scene" and is among actor Michael K. Williams' favorites.
The Futon Critic named it the ninth best episode of 2003, saying "There's simply been nobody like Omar (Michael K. Williams) on television before and he absolutely steals the show in this episode as he's called on to testify for the D.A.'s office. After being grilled by the defense for his less than moral activities, Omar responds with an amazing, funny and cheer inducing monologue about the legal system."
The episode was also praised as a 'seminal moment for the series'. The tragic death of D’Angelo Barksdale was highlighted, with one reviewer stating that the episode drew on the show's 'incredible wealth of character and story background' to 'forge a powerfully emotional and meaningful episode'.
Ratings.
The episode drew an average of 4.11 million viewers and was the second most watched program on cable television (after lead-in Sex and The City) for the week ending July 7, 2003.

New York State Route 37B

New York State Route 37B (NY 37B) is an east–west state highway located in St. Lawrence County, New York, in the United States. It serves as a business route of NY 37 through the village of Massena. While NY 37B enters the village, NY 37 bypasses it to the south. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 37 in the town of Louisville. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 37 just east of the village limits in the town of Massena. NY 37B intersects North Main Street, a state-maintained northward extension of NY 420, in Massena's central district.
The origins of NY 37B date back to the early 20th century when the New York State Legislature created Route 32, an unsigned legislative route extending from North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Massena. From Waddington to Massena, Route 32 followed River Road and Town Line Road. This portion of the route became part of NY 3 in 1924. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the Waddington–Massena segment of NY 3 became NY 37B. The route was extended east into Massena in the 1950s after NY 37 was realigned to follow a new bypass around the village.
Most of NY 37B west of Massena ran through a low-lying area along the St. Lawrence River. In 1958, this area was permanently indundated as part of the St. Lawrence Seaway's construction. As a result, NY 37B was rerouted to follow a new roadway along the fringe of Lake St. Lawrence to meet NY 37 in Louisville Corner. A connector between NY 37 and NY 37B in Louisville was designated as NY 131 by 1960. The alignments of NY 37B and NY 131 west of Massena were swapped , placing NY 37B on its modern alignment.
Route description.
NY 37B begins at an intersection with its parent route, NY 37, in the town of Louisville. The route heads to the northeast, paralleling the Grasse River as it passes a small number of homes and businesses located in the otherwise rural town. There are small patches of forested areas along the way to the Massena village line (and the town's line of the same name), where it intersects with Town Line Road (County Route 43). Once in Massena, the amount of development along the highway begins to increase. NY 37B, now known as Maple Street, continues northeast through Massena for three blocks before veering eastward upon passing Massena Memorial Hospital. 
In the center of Massena, NY 37B intersects North Main Street, which connects to NY 420 south of the village. The portion of Main Street between NY 420 and NY 37B is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY 970B, an unsigned reference route. Past North Main Street, NY 37B follows Maple Street southeast to Center Street. The route merges with Center Street and becomes a divided highway as it connects to Willow Street by way of an interchange and intersects an eastward extension of Center Street.
NY 37B turns south at the interchange, becoming Parker Avenue and crossing over the Grasse River to meet East Orvis Street on the southern riverbank. Here, the route turns east to follow East Orvis Street northeastward through the residential and commercial areas that comprise southeastern Massena. At the Massena village line, East Orvis Street becomes Highland Road, a name NY 37B retains for a short distance eastward to a junction with NY 37 (St. Regis Boulevard). Although Highland Road continues through the intersection, NY 37B ends at the junction.
History.
In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 32, an unsigned legislative route extending from North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena. It entered Massena on what is now NY 420 and followed Main Street and Maple Street through the village. West of Massena, the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River Road to a junction east of Waddington, where Route 32 continued west on modern NY 37 to Waddington. When state highways in New York were first posted in 1924, the portion of Route 32 between Waddington and Massena became part of NY 3, a highway extending across the width of the state.
The segment of NY 3 east of Watertown was rerouted as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to largely follow its modern alignment between Watertown and Plattsburgh. Most of NY 3's former alignment along the St. Lawrence River from Alexandria Bay to Hogansburg became part of the new NY 37; however, from Waddington to Massena, NY 37 used a more inland routing. As a result, the former routing of NY 3 between the two villages became NY 37B instead. In the mid-to-late 1950s, NY 37 was rerouted to follow a new bypass around the southern edge of Massena. Following its completion, NY 37B was extended eastward along NY 37's former routing on Maple Street, Parker Avenue, and Orvis Street to meet the bypass east of the village.
In the 1950s, construction began on the St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of canals and locks that would make the St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be inundated with water in order to create a navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY 37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July 1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a cofferdam upstream, creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY 37B west of Massena.
Following the destruction of the majority of NY 37B, the route was realigned west of Massena to follow a new riverside roadway to the hamlet of Louisville Corner, where it came to an end at NY 37. The remainder of NY 37B along the Massena–Louisville town line road and in Massena was unchanged. By 1960, a connector between NY 37 in Louisville and NY 37B and Massena utilizing NY 37's former routing west of the village was designated as NY 131. The alignments of NY 37B and NY 131 west of the Maple Street / Town Line Road intersection were flipped , placing NY 131 on the riverside and town line roads and NY 37B on NY 37's former routing into Massena.

<doc id="5959121" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5959121" title="Treaty of Perpetual Peace">
Treaty of Perpetual Peace

The Treaty of Perpetual Peace was signed by James IV of Scotland and Henry VII of England in 1502. It agreed to end the intermittent warfare between Scotland and England which had been waged over the previous two hundred years and although it failed in this respect, as the hostility continued intermittently throughout the 16th century, it led to the Union of the Crowns 101 years later.
Negotiations.
As part of the treaty, a marriage was agreed between James IV and Margaret Tudor, the daughter of Henry VII. Andrew Forman and the poet William Dunbar were members of the Scottish embassy who negotiated the treaty in London. Peace between England and Scotland had already been established by the Treaty of Ayton, brokered by Pedro de Ayala in 1497. Apart from the marriage, the treaty sought to outline various rules and processes for administering the English and Scottish borders and prevent local cross-border conflicts escalating to war. The treaty was signed at Richmond Palace on 24 January 1502 by Robert Blackadder, Archbishop of Glasgow, Patrick Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell and Andrew Forman.
Ratification.
James IV gave his oath to keep to the terms of the treaty at the right hand of the high altar of Glasgow Cathedral on 10 December 1502. The ceremony had to be repeated as the name of 'France' had been accidentally inserted into the text of the King's oath instead of 'England.' The English witnesses at Glasgow were Sir Thomas Darcy, Captain of Berwick with a professor of theology Dr. Henry Babington, and Sir Richard Hastyng. The two attempts were recorded by the English cleric John Deyce, and the Scottish notary Archibald Layng.
The Kings then exchanged illuminated copies of the ratifications. Two of the Scottish manuscripts were painted and gilded by Sir Thomas Galbraith, a clerk of the Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle, who was given 59 shillings for materials and time. A few days later James IV gave Thomas a present of 18 shillings on New Year's Day.
In April 1503, Henry VII sent the Bishops of Hereford and Worcester to Rome for the Pope's ratification. (Adrian Castellesi, Bishop of Hereford, had originally been sent from Italy to make peace between James III of Scotland and his son's supporters)
Consequences.
The treaty was broken in 1513 when James declared war on England in support of the French who had lately been attacked by the English. James was acting according to Scotland's obligations to France under an older mutual defence treaty, the Auld Alliance. James was excommunicated by Pope Leo X and the English Cardinal Bainbridge for breaking his sworn treaty with England. The subsequent invasion by the Scots met defeat when James was killed on 9 September 1513 at the Battle of Flodden in Northumberland.
Despite this abrogation, the Treaty of Perpetual Peace had a long-lasting effect because of the marriage between James Stewart and Margaret Tudor. Specifically, their great-grandson King James VI of Scotland was able to succeed to the English throne in 1603 at the Union of the Crowns.

Plot.
Sobotka detail.
Bunk Moreland and Beadie Russell meet with Sergeant Jay Landsman to discuss using a computer to monitor dock traffic. He is initially outraged but is more accepting when he learns that Lieutenant Cedric Daniels has granted them space in his detail's off-site location. Before storming out, he speculates that Daniels might take the 14 unsolved murder cases, which would relieve the division of the uncleared murders.
Colonel William Rawls later calls a meeting with Daniels to try to persuade him to take the Jane Doe homicides. Daniels stands firm. Later, in a tense discussion with his wife, Daniels defends his decision to stay with the police department and tells her he is "playing their game" from now on. She seems unimpressed.
Kima Greggs and Roland "Prez" Pryzbylewski follow up on the information they got from Shardene Innes's friend and find a strip club employing Eastern European dancers. Greggs and Prez watch as the girls leave the club and file into a van. They then trail the van to its destination – an apartment building where all the girls are being kept on the sixth floor.
Thomas "Herc" Hauk and Ellis Carver purchase a remote audio surveillance bug to get information "above street level" on the drug trade. Carver is dubious of the cost ($1,250 with a policeman's discount), but Herc persuades the shopkeeper to let them have it for a trial period of 48 hours in exchange for the store keeping Carver's credit card (Herc's card is "maxed out"), hoping to return it as soon as they have a meet on record. They place the bug in a tennis ball, without the necessary paperwork, and have some success monitoring Frog. However, when Nick Sobotka arrives, Frog distractedly picks up the ball from the gutter and bounces it repeatedly on the sidewalk, eventually tossing it into the busy street. Panicked that his credit card is on the line, Carver tries chasing the ball in the heavy traffic, only to watch helplessly as it is thoroughly demolished by a Mack truck. Later on, Herc and Carver plan to fraudulently claim to work with a confidential informant to recoup the cost of the surveillance bug. Herc insists that Carver register the confidential informant because Carver has the 'trustworthy look'.
Lester Freamon and Beadie continue to study the drug traffic through the docks by using their cloned computer. Freamon watches clean checkers at work just to familiarize himself with how things work. When they pick up Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa working a ship, they call in Kima and Prez for help with surveillance. Soon enough, Russell sees him "lose" a container, and they follow it back to Double G's warehouse and see Sergei "Serge" Molatov meeting with Proposition Joe. Greggs photographs the encounter.
Jimmy McNulty, currently without an assignment, spends time with his estranged wife Elena watching their sons play in a tent in the garden. Jimmy once again attempts to rekindle his relationship with Elena, but is unsuccessful as Elena admits she can never trust him again.
Bunk, Freamon and Russell decide they must persuade Daniels to take on the murders because he will permit the kind of investigation they feel that they need to run. Freamon makes an impassioned plea to Daniels, successfully convincing him that it's imperative the detail takes on the 14 murders he has been resisting all along. As a result, Daniels later visits Rawls's office to inform him that he's willing to take on the case, as long as he gets Rawls's full support on any request for support. Rawls gleefully agrees to the bargain. 
Daniels is far less successful, however, at selling the idea to his wife; when Daniels tells her he loves his job, she replies, "The job doesn't love you." She reminds him that she fell in love with him for his ambition, and he's lost his way. She exits the room in disappointment and anger.

Nick gets further involved in illegal activity and sets himself up as a supplier to Ziggy Sobotka's dealer contact Frog. He is unknowingly picked up by the surveillance of Carver and Herc.
Later, Nick brings a thick roll of bills to Ziggy at Delores' bar—compensation for his destroyed car. When Ziggy fails to show appreciation for the unexpected windfall, Nick pushes him. Ziggy shows him a letter from a law firm claiming he has fathered a child with a notoriously promiscuous local woman. Nick realizes that the letter should have been hand delivered by personal service, rather than mailed; he spontaneously calls the law firm's number and immediately, a cellphone across the room rings—it's Maui's cell phone. Half-amused, Nick tells Ziggy he has been the victim of a prank. Later, Maui continues to taunt Ziggy with a song ("Love Child" by The Supremes) from the jukebox and the other stevedores try to convince Ziggy he could take the much bigger Maui in a fight.
Frank Sobotka attends a seminar on robotic dock technology and is appalled when he realizes the automated systems threaten to make stevedores obsolete. He meets with Nat Coxson back at the union offices and appeals to him to let him extend his term as union treasurer for another year, deferring an agreement to alternate between white and black leaders annually.
Frank meets with his lobbyist, Bruce DiBiago, and expressed his frustration with the lack of progress with the politicians, all but accusing DiBiago of playing him and the union. Frank rants about his family's history and its lack of a financially secure future before delivering a box of cash and insisting that Bruce work the politicians harder to get the canal dredged.
A dock worker called New Charles suffers a severe leg injury while moving freight when his leg is trapped under heavy cargo and severely damaged. The stevedores rush to his aid and he is taken to hospital, but he ends up losing the limb. Frank and Nat visit his family and Frank delivers a thick envelope stuffed with cash, saying it's from the union. After Nat reminisces about how New Charles got his name (he arrived on the day "Old" Charles died), Nat pointedly asks Frank where the money comes from. Refusing to answer, Frank simply walks away.
D'Angelo's funeral.
Bodie Broadus buys a floral arrangement for D'Angelo Barksdale's funeral and orders it to look like the high rise tower that D'Angelo controlled before his demotion. Stringer Bell visits Brianna Barksdale's house for D'Angelo's wake and finds her inconsolable. Donette seems more pragmatic about the death. In the prison Avon Barksdale and Wee-Bey Brice discuss D'Angelo's ‘suicide’. Unaware that Stringer Bell had engineered the murder (while having the assassin make it look like suicide), Avon is despondent over his nephew's death. Still, Avon musters enough anger at the selfishness of the act to dismiss D'Angelo as weak.
The funeral is well-attended and Bodie's over-the-top floral arrangement garners compliments. After the ceremony, Proposition Joe approaches Stringer Bell to discuss sharing his supply for a share in the Barksdale organization's profits—noting that the word on the street is that the deteriorating quality of the Atlanta product is nearly unacceptable to the junkies. Stringer pragmatically agrees to present the idea to Avon during his next visit to the prison. When he does so, however, Avon angrily dismisses it out of hand.

Bromo-Seltzer

Bromo-Seltzer (acetaminophen, sodium bicarbonate, and citric acid), is an antacid used to relieve pain occurring together with heartburn, upset stomach, or acid indigestion. First produced by inventor Isaac E. Emerson's drug company of Baltimore, Maryland in 1888, Bromo-Seltzer is sold in the United States in the form of effervescent granules which must be mixed with water before ingestion.
In the days of classic radio, it was known for its slogan which was repeated rhythmically in imitation of a railroad steam engine: "BRO-mo-Selt-zer, BRO-mo-Selt-zer, ..." 
Bromo-Seltzer's main offices and main factory were located in downtown Baltimore, Maryland. The factory's most notable feature was its clock tower, which featured BROMOSELTZER in place of the numbers on all four clock faces. The tower was patterned on the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The tower originally had a 51 ft (16 m) Bromo-Seltzer bottle, glowing blue and rotating. Weighing 20 tons (18.1 tonnes), it was lined with 314 incandescent light bulbs and topped with a crown. The bottle was removed in 1936 because of structural concerns.
The product took its name from a component of the original formula, sodium bromide; it contained 3.2 mEq/teaspoon of this active ingredient. Bromides are a class of tranquilizers that were withdrawn from the American market in 1975 due to their toxicity. Their sedative effect probably accounted for Bromo-Seltzer's popularity as a hangover remedy. Early formulas also used acetanilide as the analgesic, a known poisonous substance.
Bromo-Seltzer is mentioned in the jazz standard song "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered" from the 1940 Rodgers and Hart musical "Pal Joey" and also in the Spike Jones' version of the song "Laura".
"Bromo Fizzy" is mentioned in Don Mclean's "circus song" on his debut album "Tapestry"

Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León

The Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León, better known as the MUSAC, is a contemporary art museum in the city of León, Spain.
Inaugurated in April 2005 by Felipe, Prince of Asturias, this cultural institution aims to be a "Museum of the Present", in the words of its curator Agustín Pérez Rubio, and thus only collects artworks from the latest generation of artists, between 1992 and 2012. The museum has won international prestige for its 21st-century collection and innovative programming, being labelled, for example, as "one of the most astonishingly bold museums to hit the Spanish cultural landscape in years" by "The New York Times".
The MUSAC building is celebrated for its avant-garde architecture, and it has been awarded a number of prizes, such as the 2007 European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture (Mies van der Rohe award). Designed by the architectural studio of Luis M. Mansilla and Emilio Tuñón (Mansilla+Tuñón Arquitectos), the multicolored panels that adorn the exterior of the museum resemble the stained-glass windows of a cathedral. Indeed, the architects drew their inspiration for this work from the main rose window (called "The Falconer") at the local 13th century Gothic cathedral, Santa María de León.
MUSAC has become a landmark for the city of León, and an emblem of the new 21st century Spanish architecture, as showcased in a 2006 exhibition at the MoMA of New York City ("On-Site: New Architecture in Spain"), which selected the MUSAC as one of the arquitectural projects that make Spain today "an international center for design innovation and excellence".

<doc id="5959301" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5959301" title="5.8×42mm DBP87">
5.8×42mm DBP87

The 5.8×42mm / DBP87 ("Dàn (弹) Bùqiāng (步枪) Pŭtòng (普通), 1987"; literally "Standard Rifle Cartridge, 1987") is a rifle cartridge developed in the People's Republic of China. There is limited information on this cartridge, although the Chinese military claims that it is superior to the 5.56×45mm NATO and 5.45×39mm Soviet cartridges. Another variant called the 5.8×42mm “heavy round” was designed specifically for squad automatic weapons and sniper rifles. The 5.8×42mm “heavy round” cartridge has the same dimensions as the standard 5.8mm cartridge, but utilizes a longer streamlined bullet with a heavy steel core for increased range and penetration.
History.
China started development of the 5.8×42mm / DBP87 in 1979 and finished in 1987. The 5.8×42mm / DBP87 was designed to replace the Soviet 7.62×39mm cartridge used by the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The Type 95 / QBZ-95 (Chinese: 轻武器,步枪,自动, 1995; Pinyin: Qīng wǔqì, Bùqiāng, Zìdòng, 1995; literally "Light weapon, Rifle, Automatic, 1995") 5.8 mm caliber assault rifle, firing the 5.8×42mm / DBP87 or the improved DBP95, is now the standard issue weapon in the PLA.
The 5.8×42mm is an example of an international tendency towards relatively small sized, light weight, high velocity military service cartridges. Cartridges like the American 5.56×45mm NATO, Soviet 5.45×39mm and 5.8×42mm allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges and produce relatively low bolt thrust and free recoil impulse, favouring light weight arms design and automatic fire accuracy.
In June 2004, an improved version of the 5.8x42mm cartridge entered development as the matching ammunition for the revised assault rifle, Type 95-1. Both designs were finalized in 2010 and production began the same year. This new cartridge is known as DBP10.
Performance.
The 5.8×42mm / DBP-87/95 cartridge has a muzzle velocity of 930 m/s from a standard barrel (Type 95 / QBZ-95, 463 mm barrel length) and 940 to 960 m/s from the Type 95 LSW (557 mm barrel length), with a 64-grain bullet weighing 4.15 grams. In order to save cost, several compromises were made. In particular, the cartridge case is made of steel, which is cheaper than brass. To reduce the chance of rust, the case is covered in a thin layer of protective paint in dark brown. Steel is less flexible than brass and therefore does not fill the chamber cavity as well when fired, decreasing the performance. A cleaner-burning propellant and a non-corrosive primer is used for the DBP-87.
The 5.8×42mm DBP-88 “heavy round” cartridge has a 70-grain bullet and a muzzle velocity of 870 m/s from the Type 95 LSW / Type 95 SAW / QBB-95 (557 mm barrel length) and 895 m/s from the Type 88 / QBU-88 (620 mm barrel length). It has an effective range of 800 m and can penetrate 3 mm steel plates at a distance of 1000 m. It is reported to have very good accuracy at 600 meters.
A new match round has been designed for QBU-88 to improve the rifle's complained accuracy, though no official information has been given.
The People's Liberation Army claims that the 5.8×42mm is superior to the 5.56×45mm NATO SS109 and the 5.45×39mm M74; stating it has better armor penetration of 10 mm at 300 meters, a flatter trajectory, and more retained velocity and energy at range.
The newest DBP10 version is designed to match all currently serving 5.8 mm caliber weapons, and will replace all previous DBP87/95 and DBP88 5.8x42mm rounds. Major improvements include a streamlined shape, non-corrosive primer, a reduction in the diameter of the steel core, and a copper-coated steel case with a copper alloy bullet jacket. It has a cleaner burning propellant so as not to leave residue inside the weapon after firing, as well as a heavier 77-grain bullet for better penetration of armor and other hard substances. However, although testing of the previous DBP87/95 5.8 mm rounds showed that they were less likely to cause serious wounds, the issue was not addressed with the new DBP10 round.

Cintamani

Cintāmaṇi (Sanskrit; Devanagari: चिन्तामणि) also spelled as Chintamani (or the "Chintamani Stone") is a wish-fulfilling jewel within both Hindu and Buddhist traditions, equivalent to the philosopher's stone in Western alchemy.
In Buddhism it is held by the bodhisattvas, Avalokiteshvara and Ksitigarbha. It is also seen carried upon the back of the Lung ta (wind horse) which is depicted on Tibetan prayer flags. By reciting the Dharani of Cintamani, Buddhist tradition maintains that one attains the Wisdom of Buddha, able to understand the truth of the Buddha, and turn afflictions into Bodhi. It is said to allow one to see the Holy Retinue of Amitabha and assembly upon one's deathbed. In Tibetan Buddhist tradition the Chintamani is sometimes depicted as a luminous pearl and is in the possession of several of different forms of the Buddha.
Within Hinduism it is connected with the gods, Vishnu and Ganesha. In Hindu tradition it is often depicted as a fabulous jewel in the possession of the Naga king or as on the forehead of the Makara. The "Yoga Vasistha", originally written in the 10th century AD, contains a story about the cintamani.
History.
In Buddhism the Chintamani is said to be one of four relics that came in a chest that fell from the sky (many terma fell from the sky in caskets) during the reign of king Lha Thothori Nyantsen of Tibet. Though the king did not understand the purpose of the objects, he kept them in a position of reverence. Several years later, two mysterious strangers appeared at the court of the king, explaining the four relics, which included the Buddha's bowl (possibly a Singing Bowl) and a mani stone with the Om Mani Padme Hum mantra inscribed on it. These few objects were the bringers of the Dharma to Tibet.
The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism's "ruyizhu" entry says:A '-jewel; magical jewel, which manifests whatever one wishes for (Skt. ', ', '). According to one's desires, treasures, clothing and food can be manifested, while sickness and suffering can be removed, water can be purified, etc. It is a metaphor for the teachings and virtues of the Buddha. … Said to be obtained from the dragon-king of the sea, or the head of the great fish, Makara, or the relics of a Buddha.
The Kintamani mountainous region in Bali was named after the Cintamani.
Popular culture.
The Cintamani Stone is the subject of "Dragon Ball" and "". In the former, the concept is used as seven mystical orbs known as Dragon Balls which when gathered together summon an Eternal Dragon capable of granting almost any wish, making them the target of several villains who desire eternal life or power over the universe. In the latter, it is not in fact a jewel but amber, fossilized resin from the Tree of Life which grants nigh invulnerability to those who use it, but at a terrible price, it turns the users into brutish, blue, simple-minded savages after long term exposure.
The Tibetan expedition of 1925-28 by Nicholas Roerich is often associated with the Cintamani Stone. Reportedly Roerich, living at that time in New York and being active in the League of Nations, was tasked with returning a fragment of the Stone to Tibet. From the letters of the future US Vice-President Henry A. Wallace it can be deduced that Roerich also brought the Stone to the US. According to many occult writings, the Stone is kept in the underground city of Shambhala and fragments of it are to be lend out to humanity to assist them in the time of great disasters and wars. Roerich travelled to Tibet with the Stone (after a mysterious detour to Russia via Siberia); it is speculated that he indeed reached Shambhala, as he was thought missing between summer of 1927 and June of 1928, when the entourage mysteriously reappeared in India.

The administration "stand against the destructiveness of para-church organizations", a reference to Christian ministries not operating under the authority of a local church.
The "General Information" section highlights more rules for students. It states that "the activities on campus, the dormitory life, and the entire program of the college require the full participation and cooperation of every student." Students must attend North Valley Baptist Church, unless an active member of another "local, "fundamental Baptist" church" before applying to the school. Even then, the student "must first obtain special administrative approval in order to attend his home church while enrolled at GSBC." Attendance at the daily chapel service is required. "Golden State Baptist College students are expected to go "soul winning" for a minimum of three hours per week." "Christian service" of all students (such as teaching Sunday school classes, working on bus routes, or participating in the music ministry) "will be under administrative supervision." Administrative approval is required before obtaining any off-campus job.

Neacșu's letter

The letter of Neacșu of Câmpulung (Romanian: "Scrisoarea lui Neacșu de la Câmpulung"), written in 1521, is the oldest surviving document available in Romanian that can be reliably dated. Written using Cyrillic, it was sent by Neacșu Lupu, a boyar from Câmpulung, Wallachia (now Argeș County, Romania) to Johannes Benkner, the mayor of Brassó, Kingdom of Hungary (now Brașov, Romania), warning him about the imminent attack of the Ottoman Empire on Transylvania.
Neacșu Lupu was a 16th-century Wallachian boyar from Câmpulung, the son of Neacșu Mircea, mentioned for the first time during Vlad cel Tânăr's reign (1510–1512), in documents related to a trial regarding debts between himself and merchants of Brașov. It is possible that he was himself a merchant involved in the trade of Turkish goods that he was buying south of the Danube and selling in Transylvania, which may explain his relationship with the mayor of Brașov.
History.
The Letter of Neacșu of Câmpulung to Johannes (Hans) Benkner of Brașov was most probably written on the June 29 or 30, 1521, in the city of "Dlăgopole" (Slavonic rendition of Câmpulung). The date is not mentioned within the letter itself, it being inferred from the historic events described and the people mentioned.
The letter was discovered in 1894 by Wilhelm Stenner, the archivar of Brașov.
Contents.
The text of the letter was written in the Cyrillic script, and is composed of three parts. The introduction in Slavonic, translated: "To the most wise and noble and venerable and by God endowed master Hanas Benger of Braşov, all the best, from Neacșu of Câmpulung".
Following the Slavonic introduction, the content of the letter is written in the old Romanian language. As opposed to the first documents of other languages, which are in general more ancient, the Romanian language used in this letter is very similar to the language spoken in the present-day. The Romanian linguist Aurel Nicolescu stated that no less than 175 words of the 190 found in the letter have Latin origins, this not counting the repeated words and the names. Some incorrect forms of different words appear due to the difficulty of representing some Romanian sounds like "ă" and "î", while using the Cyrillic alphabet.
Neacșu Lupu’s letter contained a secret of great importance, warning Johannes Benkner of Brașov about Turkish preparations for an invasion through Transylvania and Wallachia.
Various Slavonic expressions are also present throughout the content of the letter, such as "I pak", which has a similar meaning to the Latin "item", but is also used to mark the beginning of a new sentence, as no punctuation marks are present in the text. Another Slavonic word is "za", meaning "about".
The letter ends with another sentence written in Slavonic, which means: "And may God bring happiness upon you. Amen."

"the Romanian land", this being also the first mention of the name "Romania" in a Romanian text] wherever he pleases.
And so you should know that our Basarab too is fearful of that thief Mahamet beg, even more so than you.
And so I'm telling you as my superior about what I have found out. I am telling you, and you are wise and you should keep these words for yourself, so that no many people know, and you should take proper guard.
And may God bring you happiness. Amen."

G-On Riders

While the original 13 episodes primarily used fan service with nothing actually shown, the OVA included nude scenes of many in the female cast as well as a mock bukkake scene. The OVA was included as a DVD special.
Plot.
In the near future, most of the Earth has been conquered by aliens. However, a small region in Japan has successfully repelled them thanks to the development of "G-On" technology by the Grand Rifurekuto Amudo/Grand Reflect Armored (GRA). This technology involves a band of girls (at first two, then three) who channel energy through special glasses. In this way they're able to destroy the giant mechanized monsters, "Fancy Beasts," sent by the aliens.
Episodes.
Each episode is called a "Glass," to reinforce the meganekko theme. Episode 14 is the OVA, which went unaired due to more explicit content than the other episodes, including nudity and adult situations.

King (2003 TV series)

King is a Canadian television series on Family, also aired on Nicktoons TV in the UK from 4 March 2006, and showing on POP! on March 12, 2007.
Plot.
The show is about a boy named Russel who finds a portal under his bed leading to an alternate universe called Under. Since he is from Up and acquires the crown of Under, he is proclaimed the King. Most episodes have multiple sub-plots, and deal with the menacing Bob-Wire's attempts to steal back the crown and become the king (having to be foiled by Russel and/or his friends). Other recurring themes are Under's former king Cliff's attempts to bully Russel into handing over the crown while he's in Up (Earth), and various confrontations between Under and the neighbouring country of Near-Under. Other issues involve monster problems, and more general topics such as money, environmental issues, and even time-travel.
Non-Kingdom places.
The world Under where the show takes place is made up of three different continents. Under (where the Kingdoms of Under and Near-Under, and the Empire of Flax are located), Ahead-of-Under and Before-Under. The underground caverns below the continent of Under is called Under-Under, and the ocean surrounding all the lands is called either Under Sea or the Sassafras Sea (though Under Sea may refer to Cousin Tess' underwater realm only, i.e. excluding all the islands, etc.). Unless otherwise stated, the places below take place in the Kingdom of Under (not to be confused with the central town of Under surrounding the castle). Also, all islands are located on the Sassafras Sea.
Species.
Anthropormorphic creatures.
There are a variety of creatures who are quite intelligent and can be considered the "people" of Under (the world). Some species are common while others are rare to the point that only one or two members have been seen on the show, most of these rare creatures aren't listed here. It should be noted that many species haven't been given canonical names and the majority of this section is conjectural.
Episode list.
52 episodes were produced over three seasons:

Utopia (website)

Utopia is a website with daily updating of information about LGBT culture in the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.
Utopia, founded by American John C. Goss, was a ground-breaking Internet enterprise when it was formed in Bangkok, Thailand, on December 13, 1995. At the time of its launch, such information was hard to come by, even for LGBT citizens within their own nations. Since then, it has pioneered new businesses, published seminal books and forged relationships to emerge as a potent unifying force for Asian LGBT people.
The Utopia website was preceded by the opening of Southeast Asia's first gay and lesbian center, one year earlier, in December 2004. Goss and partners from Singapore, Thailand and the United States opened the Utopia complex in the Sukhumvit Road area of Bangkok and it included an LGBT bookshop, cafe, pub and guesthouse. The center went on to host author readings, women’s workshops, AIDS/HIV education and fundraising, and Bangkok’s first International Lesbian and Gay Film/Video Festival: Hearts of Light, programmed by Canadian filmmaker, Paul Lee.
The Utopia website was the first Internet portal providing up-to-date pan-Asian information in a non-pornographic format. An archive of the Utopia website is available from 1996 onwards at The Wayback Machine. The website went on to garner recognition from TIME Magazine, Lonely Planet, Yahoo!, Gay Times, Advocate and BBC World Service.
Utopia was a founding sponsor of the first Bangkok Gay Festival in 1999, the first Pattaya Gay Festival in 2001, and also sponsored the annual Phuket Gay Festival.
The annual Utopia Awards was established in 2000 to give special recognition to gay and lesbian pioneers in Asia and other worthy groups and individuals who have made outstanding contributions to Asia's LGBT community.
In 2005-2007, Goss began publication of ten landmark Utopia Guide books to gay and lesbian life in China; Cambodia/Laos/Myanmar/Vietnam; Thailand; Singapore; Malaysia; Indonesia; Japan; South Korea; Taiwan; and Asia (16 countries).
Utopia continues to pursue its original goal to improve the lives of Asian lesbians and gay men, to build community, and to foster a deeper understanding of gay life in the region. The Utopia website remains the Internet’s most respected and comprehensive English-language resource for the multi-faceted homosexual subcultures of Asia.

Chicago Bandits

The Chicago Bandits are a women's professional softball team based in Rosemont, Illinois. Since the 2005 season, they have played as a member of National Pro Fastpitch (NPF). The Bandits won the 2008 NPF championship, defeating the Washington Glory in the final game of the championship series. The team won their second NPF championship following the 2011 season when they won the championship series two games to none over the USSSA Pride. They play their home games at The Ballpark at Rosemont in Rosemont, Illinois.
Franchise history.
2005.
The Chicago Bandits inaugural season took place at Benedictine University in Lisle, IL. Chicago recorded an NPF-best 41-7 record, but lost to the Akron Racers in the championship.
2006.
Chicago posted a 30-12 record, which again was best in the NPF, but lost to the Connecticut Brakettes in the championship series.
2007.
The 2007 Chicago Bandits went 23-21, but failed to qualify for the playoffs after finishing in sixth place in the league.
2008.
The Bandits began their first season in Elgin with a 4-7 record, playing without Jennie Finch and Vicky Galindo of the United States National Team, and Caitlin Lever of the Canadian National Team, due to the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Jessica Sallinger and Kristina Thorson each won 12 games and were Chicago's first duo to record double-digit victories since Jennie Finch and Amy Harre in 2005. After moving to their new stadium, the Bandits recorded 61 home runs in 2008, which was more home runs than in the franchise's first three years combined. The team's home run leaders were Stacy May (13), Rachel Folden (11), and Jamie Clark (11).
The Bandits completed their season sweeping the Akron Racers, New England Riptide and Rockford Thunder to finish the regular season 32-16 and on a 12-game winning streak, earning the highest seed in the 2008 Championship Series.
In the Championship Series, Chicago won all three games and earned the franchise's first NPF Championship with a victory over the Washington Glory in the title game.
2009.
The Chicago Bandits began their second season at Judson University in Elgin, IL with the return of Olympians Jennie Finch, Vicky Galindo, and Caitlin Lever. Chicago finished the regular season with a 27-12 record, ranking first in the National Pro Fastpitch standings and earning the top seed for the playoffs in Akron, Ohio.
Despite having the best record in the NPF in 2009, Chicago was upset in the NPF playoffs by the USSSA Pride two games to one, and lost the opportunity to repeat as league champions.
2010.
In 2010, the Bandits once again won the regular season title, but once again, the USSSA Pride ended the Bandits championship hopes, winning their first Cowles Cup title.
After the season, standouts Stacy May-Johnson and Jennie Finch announced their retirements from professional softball.
2011.
The Bandits moved into their brand new home stadium in Rosemont in time for the beginning of the 2011 season. The team officially opened the stadium for NPF play on June 16, 2011 with a ribbon-cutting ceremony prior to the Bandits 1-0 walk-off win over the USSSA Pride. Caitlin Lever drove in the winning run in the bottom of the 7th.
Unlike the previous three years, the Bandits did not win the regular season title. They finished third in the four-team NPF with a 20-20 record, after losing six of their final eight games at home to close out the regular season. 
The Bandits opened the playoffs in Sulphur, LA against the second-seeded Akron Racers and swept the Racers with two straight victories, capped off by a three-run walk-off home run in extra innings by Nikki Nemitz to advance to the finals.
In the finals, they once again met the Pride. In the first game, the Pride took an early 2-0 lead, but rookie Megan Wiggins hit a three-run double off Pride starter Cat Osterman. Two pitches later, Osterman went down with an arm injury, but the Pride came back to tie the game at 3 in the bottom of the 7th. In the 8th, Bandits right-fielder Amber Patton drove in the go-ahead run and NPF Co-Pitcher of the Year Monica Abbott made it stand up for a one game lead in the best-of-three series.
The next afternoon, Chicago got on the board early and often, scoring five times in the bottom of the first. The Pride got two back, but that was as close as they would get the rest of the day, as the Bandits cruised to their second Cowles Cup championship with a 10-3 victory. They became the first NPF team to win multiple Cowles Cup championships.

<doc id="5959512" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5959512" title="Megalithic Temples of Malta">
Megalithic Temples of Malta

The Megalithic Temples of Malta are the eleven prehistoric monuments, of which seven are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, built during three distinct time periods between 3000 BC and 700 BC approximately. They have been claimed as the oldest free-standing structures on Earth, although the largely buried Göbekli Tepe complex is now believed to be older. Archaeologists believe that these megalithic complexes are the result of local innovations in a process of cultural evolution. This led to the building of several temples of the Ġgantija phase (3600-3000 BC), culminating in the large Tarxien temple complex, which remained in use until 2500 BC. After this date, the temple building culture disappeared.
The Ġgantija temples (two sites) were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. In 1992, the UNESCO Committee further extended the existing listing to include five other megalithic temple sites. These are Ħaġar Qim (in Qrendi), Mnajdra (in Qrendi), Ta' Ħaġrat Temples (in Mġarr), Skorba Temples (in Żebbiegħ) and Tarxien Temples (in Tarxien). Nowadays, the sites are managed by Heritage Malta, while ownership of the surrounding lands varies from site to site.
Other sites apart from those included in the UNESCO World Heritage list include Borġ in-Nadur (in Birżebbuġa), Kordin III, Il-Bidni, Xemxija Temple, Hal Ginwi Temples, Tal-Quadi (fr, ru), Ta' Marżiena, Ta' Raddiena, L-Imramma Temple, Buġibba, Santa Verna, Tas-Silġ (in Żejtun) and a complex network of tracks gouged in the rock Misraħ Għar il-Kbir (in Dingli) and other.
Etymology.
Many of the names used to refer to the different sites carry a link with the stones used for their building. The Maltese word for boulders, " 'ħaġar' "is common to Ta’ Ħaġrat and Ħaġar Qim. While the former uses the word in conjunction with the marker of possession, the latter adds the word " 'Qim' ", which is either a form of the Maltese word for " 'worship' "or an archaic form of the word meaning " 'standing'."
Maltese folklore describes giants as having built the temples, which led to the name Ġgantija, meaning " 'Giants’ tower' ". The Maltese linguist Joseph Aquilina believed that Mnajdra was the diminutive of " 'mandra' ", meaning a plot of ground planted with cultivated trees; however he also named the arbitrary derivation from the Arabic root " 'manzara' ", meaning 'a place with commanding views.' The Tarxien temples owe their name to the locality where they were found (from "Tirix", meaning a large stone), as were the remains excavated at Skorba.
History.
Dates.
The temples were the result of several phases of construction, from circa 3000 to 2200 BC; there is evidence of human activity in the islands since the Early Neolithic Period (ca. 5000 BC), testified by pottery shards, charred remains of fires and bones. The dating and understanding of the various phases of activity in the temples is not easy. The main problem found is that the sites themselves are evolutionary in nature, in that each successive temple brought with it further refinement to architectural development.
Furthermore, in some cases, later Bronze-age peoples built their own sites over the Neolithic temples, thus adding an element of confusion to early researchers who did not have modern dating technology. Sir Temi Żammit, an eminent Maltese archaeologist of the late nineteenth century, had dated the Neolithic temples to 2800 BC and the Tarxien Bronze Age culture to 2000 BC. These dates were considered "considerably too high" by scholars, who proposed a reduction of half a millennium each. However, radiocarbon testing favoured Żammit’s dating. A theory that the temple art was connected with an Aegean-derived culture collapsed with this proof of the temples' elder origins.
Temple phases.
The development of the chronological phases, based on recalibrated radiocarbon dating, has split the period up to the Bronze Age in Malta into a number of phases. The first evidence of human habitation in the Neolithic occurred in the Għar Dalam phase, in c. 5000 BC. The Temple period, from c. 4100 BC to roughly 2500 BC, produced the most notable monumental remains. This period is split into five phases, however the first two of these left mostly pottery shards. The next three phases, starting from the Ġgantija phase, begins in c. 3600 BC, and the last, the Tarxien phase, ends in c. 2500 BC.
Ġgantija phase (3600–3200 BC).
The Ġgantija phase is named after the Ġgantija site in Gozo. It represents an important development in the cultural evolution of neolithic man on the islands. To this date belong the earliest datable temples and the first two, if not three, of the stages of development in their ground plan: the lobed or kidney-shaped plan found in Mġarr east, the trefoil plan evident in Skorba, Kordin and various minor sites, and the five-apsed plan Ġgantija South, Tarxien East.
Saflieni phase (3300–3000 BC).
The Saflieni phase constitutes a transitional phase between two major periods of development. Its name derives from the site of the Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni.This period carried forward the same characteristics of the Ġgantija pottery shapes, but it also introduces new biconical bowls.
Tarxien phase: (3150–2500 BC).
The Tarxien phase marks the peak of the temple civilisation. This phase is named after the temple-complex at Tarxien, a couple of kilometres inland from the Grand Harbour. To it belong the last two stages in the development of the temple plan. The western temple at Ġgantija represents, along with other units in Tarxien, Ħaġar Qim and L-Imnajdra, the penultimate stage in development, that is, the introduction of a shallow niche instead of an apse at the far end of the temple. The final stage is testified in only one temple, the central unit at Tarxien, with its three symmetrical pairs of apses. The Temple culture reached its climax in this period, both in terms of the craftsmanship of pottery, as well as in sculptural decoration, both free-standing and in relief.
Spiral reliefs resembling those at Tarxien once adorned the Ġgantija temples, but have faded to a level where they are only clearly recognisable in a series of drawings made by the artist Charles de Brochtorff in 1829, immediately after the temples’ excavation. The Tarxien phase is characterised by a rich variety of pottery forms and decorative techniques. Most shapes tend to be angular, with almost no handles or lugs. The clay tends to be well prepared and fired very hard, while the surface of the scratched ware is also highly polished. This scratched decoration remains standard, but it becomes more elaborate and elegant, the most popular motif being a kind of volute.
Architecture and Construction.
The Maltese temple complexes were built in different locations, and over a wide span of years; while each individual site has its unique characteristics, they all share a common architecture. The approach to the temples lies on an oval forecourt, levelled by terracing if the terrain is sloping. The forecourt is bounded on one side by the temples’ own façades, which faces south or south-east. The monuments’ façades and internal walls are made up of orthostats, a row of large stone slabs laid on end.
The centre of the façades is usually interrupted by an entrance doorway forming a "trilithon", a pair of orthostats surmounted by a massive lintel slab. Further trilithons form a passage, which is always paved in stone. This in turn opens onto an open space, which then gives way to the next element, a pair of D-shaped chambers, usually referred to as ‘apses’, opening on both sides of the passage. The space between the apses’ walls and the external boundary wall is usually filled with loose stones and earth, sometimes containing cultural debris including pottery shards.
The main variation in the temples lies in the number of apses found; this may vary to three, four, five or six. If three, they open directly from the central court in a trefoil fashion. In cases of more complex temples, a second axial passage is built, using the same trilithon construction, leading from the first set of apses into another later pair, and either a fifth central or a niche giving the four or five apsial form. In one case, at the Tarxien central temple, the fifth apse or niche is replaced by a further passage, leading to a final pair of apses, making six in all. With the standard temple plan, found in some thirty temples across the islands, there is a certain amount of variation both in the number of apses, and in the overall length – ranging from 6.5m in the Mnajdra east temple to 23m in the six-apsed Tarxien central temple.
The external walls were usually built of coralline limestone, which is harder than the globigerina limestone used in the internal sections of the temples. The softer globigerina was used for decorative elements within the temples, usually carvings. These features are usually sculpted in relief, and they show a variety of designs linked to vegetative or animal symbolism. These usually depict running spiral motifs, trees and plants as well as a selection of animals. Although in their present form the temples are unroofed, a series of unproven theories regarding possible ceiling and roof structures have been debated for several years.
The UNESCO Sites.
Ġgantija.
The Ġgantija temples stand at the end of the Xagħra plateau, facing towards the south-east. Its presence was known for a very long time, and even before any excavations were carried out a largely correct plan of its layout was drawn by Jean-Pierre Hoüel in the late eighteenth century. In 1827, the site was cleared of debris – the soil and remains being lost without proper examination. The loss resulting from this clearance was partially compensated by the German artist Brochtorff, who painted the site within a year or two from the removal of the debris. This is the only practical record of the clearance.
A boundary wall encloses the two temples. The southerly one is the elder, and is better preserved. The plan of the temple incorporates five large apses, with traces of the plaster that once covered the irregular wall still clinging between the blocks.
Ta’ Ħaġrat.
The Ta' Ħaġrat temple in Mġarr is on the eastern outskirts of the village, roughly one kilometer from the Ta' Skorba temples. The remains consist of a double temple, made up of two adjacent complexes, both in the shape of a trefoil. The two parts are both less regularly planned and smaller in size than many of the other neolithic temples in Malta, and no blocks are decorated. Sir Temi Żammit excavated the site in 1925-27. A village on the site that pre-dates the temples by centuries has provided plentiful examples of what is now known as "Mġarr phase" pottery.
Ta’ Skorba (Skorba).
The importance of this site lies less in the remains than in the information garnered from their excavations. This monument has a typical three-apsed shape of the Ġgantija phase, of which the greater part of the first two apses and the whole of the façade have been destroyed to ground level. What remains are the stone paving of the entrance passage, with its perforations, the "torba" floors, and a large upright slab of coralline limestone. The north wall is in better shape; originally the entrance opened on a court, but the doorway was later closed off in the Tarxien phase, with altars set in the corners formed by the closure. East of this temple, a second monument was added in the Tarxien phase, with four apses and a central niche. Before the temples were built, the area had supported a village over a period of roughly twelve centuries.
The oldest structure is the eleven metre long straight wall to the west of the temples’ first entrance. The deposit against it contained material from the first known human occupation of the island, the Għar Dalam phase. Among the domestic deposits found in this material, which included charcoal and carbonised grain, there were several fragments of daub, accidentally baked. The charcoal fragments were then radiocarbon dated, and their age analysis stood at 4850 BC.
Ħaġar Qim.
Ħaġar Qim stands on a ridge some two kilometers away from the villages of Qrendi and Siggiewi. Its builders used the soft globigerina limestone that caps the ridge to construct the temple. One can clearly see the effects of this choice in the outer southern wall, where the great orthostats are exposed to the sea-winds. Here the temple has suffered from severe weathering and surface flaking over the centuries.
The temple’s façade is typical, with a trilithon entrance, a bench and orthostats. It has a wide forecourt, with a retaining wall, through which a passage runs through the middle of the building. This entrance passage and first court follow the common, though considerably modified, Maltese megalithic design. A separate entrance gives access to four enclosures, which are independent of each other and replace The north-westerly apse.
L-Imnajdra.
L-Imnajdra temples lies in a hollow 500 metres from Ħaġar Qim. It is another complex site in its own right, and it is centred on a near circular forecourt. Three adjacent temples overlook it from one side, while a terrace from the other separates it from a steep slope that runs down to the sea. The first buildings on the right are small irregular chambers, similar to the enclosures in Ħaġar Qim. Then there is a small trefoil temple, dating from the Ġgantija phase, with pitted decorations. Its unusual triple entrance was copied on a larger scale in the second temple. The middle temple was actually the last to be built, inserted between the others in the Tarxien phase, after 3100 BC. It has four apses and a niche.
The third temple, built early in the Tarxien phase and so second in date, opens on the court at a lower level. It has a markedly concave façade, with a bench, orthostats and trilithon entrance.
The southern temple is oriented astronomically aligned with the rising sun during solstices and equinoxes; during the summer solstice the first rays of sunlight light up the edge of a decorated megalith between the first apses, while during the winter solstice the same effect occurs on a megalith in the opposite apse. During the equinox, the rays of the rising sun pass straight through the principal doorway to reach the innermost central niche.
Tarxien.
The Tarxien temple complex is found some 400 metres to the east of the Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni. The three temples found here were seriously excavated in the early twentieth century by Temi Żammit. Unlike the other sites, this temple is bounded on all sides by modern urban development; however, this does not detract from its value. One enters into the first great forecourt of the southern temple, marked by its rounded façade and a cistern, which is attributed to the temple. The earliest temple to the north-east was built between 3600 and 3200 BC; it consisted of two parallel sets of semi-circular apses, with a passage in the middle.
The south and east temples were built in the Tarxien phase, between 3150 and 2500 BC. The second one has three parallel semi-circular apses, connected by a large passage; the third one has two parallel sets of apses with a passage in a direction parallel to that of the first temple. The first temple is solidly built with large stones, of which some are roughly dressed. The walls are laid with great accuracy, and are very imposing in their simplicity. The second temple is more elaborately constructed, the walls being finished with greater care, some of the standing slabs being decorated with flat raised spirals. In one of the chambers, two bulls and a sow are cut in low relief across one of the walls. The third temple has a carelessly-built frame, but most of its standing stones are richly decorated with carved patterns.

Dew, Texas

Dew is an unincorporated community in southern Freestone County, Texas, United States. It is located at the junction of State Highway 75 and Farm to Market Road 489, nine miles south of Fairfield, the county seat.
Originally known as Avant or Avant Prairie, the area was first settled in the 1850s by pioneers from Alabama. It hosted a post office under the name "Avant" from 1853 through January 1885 [http://www.rootsweb.com/~txpost/freestone.html]. In 1870, the settlement's name was changed to Sunshine after a local Methodist church. A post office was reestablished in December 1885 with the town renamed Dew. Locals requested the name "Drew" to honor a local resident, but the postal authorities misread the application.
The population of Dew peaked in 1947, when it was home to 195 residents. Approximately 70 people reside in Dew today. The Dew Independent School District serves area students.

La Fuga

La fuga () is a 2001 Argentine film directed by Eduardo Mignogna.
The picture stars Mignogna's friend and frequent collaborator, Ricardo Darin, as well as Miguel Angel Sola, Gerardo Romano, Patricio Contreras, Ines Estevez, Alejandro Awada and Norma Aleandro.
Plot.
In the summer of 1928, seven inmates from the National Penitentiary in Buenos Aires manage to escape by tunneling their way out of prison and into a coal store run by an old couple. The old woman dies of a heart attack and the escapees flee the place. The film narrates the fate of each of these runaways in search of their destiny - tough men with their own ethical codes and ready to do anything not to return to prison - through flashbacks and separate, sometimes interconnecting, stories.
Cast.
Laureano Irala (Miguel Angel Sola): an ex-con and narrator of the story, Irala feels guilty about the death of the old lady, so when the old man mistakes him for his nephew, he decides to stay with him and care for him as he lies low in his store. The old man eventually dies, which prompts Irala to sell the store and walk away with the money.
Domingo "El Pibe" Santaló (Ricardo Darín): an expert poker player working for Pedro Escofet, a gambler. Before going to prison for being caught with fake money, Santaló used to play for Escofet and took her mistress, Tabita, as his own. Once escaped, Santaló returns to the gambling business. But a game goes terribly wrong against Víctor Ganz, and loses all the money. Escofet, thinking Santaló and Ganz have made an arrangement, shoots Santaló, and is in turn shot by Tabita, who leaves Santaló to die. It is then revealed that it was Tabita who had made an arrangement with Ganz, who had a twin brother so that he would switch with him whenever he felt tired.
Dr. Julio Bordiola (Gerardo Romano): Bordiola used to be in the bookie business, but retired when he shot a debtor who he thought was going to kill him - in front of his 10 year-old daughter. Bordiola later on marries Rita Baldini, an underaged who goes on to have an affair with Ramón Cedeyra, a horse-dealer. Bordiola shoots Cedeyra and is sent to prison. After two years he escapes, only to find his wife's suicide note, where it is revealed that she was the 10 year-old girl, and Bordiola had shot her father. After that, she had married him in order to avenge him, but had fallen in love with him. Bordiola's ultimate fate remains unknown.
Tomás Opitti (Alejandro Awada): A byplane pilot who, after flying a terrorist, is mistaken for his accomplice by detective Eusebio Duval, and his family is in turn killed in a raid. Duval acknowledges his innocence, but sends him to prison anyway. After escaping, a friend of Opitti's is mistaken for him and gunned down by Duval. Opitti goes on to ambush Duval in a whore-house, knocks him unconscious, drags him to an abandoned air-field and ties him to a plane's engine, whereupon he starts it and stands aside as Duval is spun to death. Opitti's ultimate fate is unknown.
Belisario "El Pampa" Zacarías (Oscar Alegre): A homosexual who is incarcerated along his accomplice and lover, "The Turk", for kidnapping and murder. El Pampa insists on building a monument after escaping with his lover, but dies during the escape attempt, crushed by the falling tunnel.
Omar "The Turk" Zajur (Vando Villamil): A homosexual who is incarcerated along his accomplice and lover, "El Pampa", for kidnapping and murder. The Turk subsequently reunites with El Pampa's widow, La Varela (Norma Aleandro), who despises him for making her husband a homosexual. The Turk goes on to vandalize the obelisk in memory of his lover, who had wanted "a monument" to celebrate the escape.
Camilo Vallejo (Alberto Jiménez): A quiet anarchist who after escaping goes on to bomb a government coach. The bomb, however, proves hard to set off, and by the time it has been activated, the coach drives off and Vallejo is left with the ticking bomb on the crowded street. Vallejo starts shouting out warnings until the crowd clears and he is left alone with the bomb. He cried "Long live anarchy!" and covers the explosive with his body before being blasted off.

Local shared object

Local shared objects (LSOs), commonly called Flash cookies (due to their similarities with HTTP cookies), are pieces of data that websites which use Adobe Flash may store on a user's computer. Local shared objects are used by all versions of Adobe Flash Player and version 6 and above of Macromedia's now-obsolete Flash Player.
An important use of these types of files is storing save data from Flash games on the user's computer.
While websites may use local shared objects for purposes such as storing user preferences, there have been privacy concerns regarding local shared objects, and they may be considered a breach of browser security.
Storage.
Local shared objects contain data stored by individual websites. With the default settings, the Flash Player does not seek the user's permission to store local shared objects on the hard disk. By default, a SWF application running in Flash Player from version 9 to 11 (as of Sept 1, 2011) may store up to of data to user's hard drive. If the application attempts to store more data than the allotted default, the user is shown a dialog to allow or deny the request for more storage space.
Adobe Flash Player does not allow 3rd-party local shared objects to be shared across domains. For example, a local shared object from "www.example.com" cannot be read by the domain "www.example.net". However, the first party website can always pass data to a third party via some settings found in the dedicated XML file and passing the data in the request to the third party. Also, third party LSOs are allowed to store data by default. By default LSO data is shared across browsers on the same machine. As an example:
This is unique from cookies which have directory isolated storage paths for saved cookies while LSOs use a common directory path for all browsers on a single machine.
Criticism.
Many web based Flash games use LSO files to store the user's personal game data, such as user preferences and actual game progress. Backing up files such as these requires a more technical understanding of software, and would be considered by most average users to be a difficult task. However, both browser updates and programs designed to remove unused files may delete this data.
To help combat cheating, game developers may render LSO files unusable if moved or uploaded from another location or backup. This has been criticized, however, as it may cause users to lose data despite backups.
Privacy concerns.
As with HTTP cookies, local shared objects can be used by web sites to collect information on how people navigate those web sites even if people believe that they have restricted the data collection. Online banks, merchants, or advertisers may use local shared objects for tracking purposes.
On 10 August 2009, Wired magazine reported that more than half of the top websites used local shared objects to track users and store information about them but only four of them mentioned it in their privacy policy. "Flash cookies are relatively unknown to web users," it said, "even if a user thinks they have cleared their computer of tracking objects, they most likely have not." The article further asserts that some websites use Flash cookies as hidden backups, so that they can revive HTTP cookies when user deletes them.
According to New York Times, since July 2010, there had been at least five class-action lawsuits in the United States against media companies for using local shared objects.
In certain countries, it is illegal to track users without their knowledge and consent. For example, in the United Kingdom, customers must consent to use of cookies/local shared objects:
Local shared objects were the first subject to be discussed in the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) roundtable in January 2010. FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz has been talking with Adobe about what it describes as "the Flash problem."
User control.
Users can disable local shared objects using the "Global Storage Settings panel" of the online Settings Manager at Adobe's website. However, using this feature will permanently place a flash cookie on the user's computer, informing all other websites that the user does not want flash cookies stored on their computer. Users can also opt-out of them on a per-site basis by right-clicking the Flash Player and selecting "Settings" from the popup menu that will appear, or using the "Website Storage Settings" panel. The latter also allows users to delete local shared objects.
Users may also delete local shared objects either manually or using third-party software. For instance, BetterPrivacy, a Firefox add-on, or CCleaner, a standalone computer program for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, allow users to delete local shared objects on demand.
Since version 10.3 of Flash, the Online Settings Manager (letting users configure privacy and security permissions via Adobe's website) is superseded by the Local Settings Manager under the Windows Control Panel, Mac OS System Preferences, Linux KDE System settings or Linux GNOME System > Preferences. Users of other operating systems still use the Adobe Online Settings Manager. Since at least April 2012 (v 11.2.202.233), updating by downloading a new Flash version resets the security and privacy settings to the defaults of allowing local storage and asking for media access again, which may be against users' wishes.
Browser control.
Browser control refers to the web browser's ability to delete local shared objects and to prevent the creation of persistent local shared objects when privacy mode is enabled. As for the former, Internet Explorer 8, released on March 19, 2009, implements an API that allows browser extensions to co-operate with the browser and delete their persistent data stored when user issues a "Delete Browsing History" command. However, two years passed since its introduction until Adobe, on March 7, 2011, announced that Flash Player v10.3, which was still in development at the time, supports co-operating with Internet Explorer 8 or later to delete local shared objects.
Also on January 5, 2011, Adobe Systems, Google Inc., and Mozilla Foundation finalized a new browser API (dubbed "NPAPI ClearSiteData"). This will allow browsers implementing the API to clear local shared objects. Four months later, Adobe announced that Flash Player 10.3 enables Mozilla Firefox 4 and "future releases of Apple Safari and Google Chrome" to delete local shared objects, so since version 4, Firefox treats LSOs the same way as HTTP cookies - deletion rules that previously applied only to HTTP cookies now also apply to LSOs. This caused loss of data and backward-incompatible flash application behavior for those Firefox and Flash users which used HTTP cookies and Flash local shared objects for different goals. Mainly this had an impact on the flash gaming community, which relies heavily on Flash LSOs to store saved games. The resulting support requests cannot be solved favorably for the Mozilla Firefox users without changes to the browser, because of the introduced equivalence between HTTP and flash cookies. Currently, the workaround in use is to either configure the browser to never clear history data and cookies, or to revert the part of the changes affecting this use case, using third-party patches.
As for the behavior in browser's privacy mode, Adobe Flash Player 10.1, released on June 10, 2010, supports the privacy modes of Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari. Local shared objects created in privacy are discarded at the end of the session. Those created in a regular session are also not accessible in privacy mode.
File locations.
The default storage location for local shared objects is operating system-dependent, and depends on the flash plugin being NPAPI or PPAPI.
NPAPI.
On Microsoft Windows NT 5.x and 6.x, they are stored in:
On Mac OS X, they are stored in:
On Linux or Unix, they are stored in:
For Linux and Unix systems, if the open-source Gnash plugin is being used instead of the official Adobe Flash, they will instead be found at:

American patriotism

American patriotism refers to patriotism involving cultural attachment of Americans to the United States as their homeland. American patriotism has been identified by some as distinct from American nationalism because of the emphasis of American patriotism upon values rather than a commitment to a nation. Ralph Waldo Emerson described the United States as an "asylum of all nations". Official American values were laid out in the Declaration of Independence that emphasized human rights, such as declaring that "all men are created equal", that people have "inalienable rights", and that people have the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". American patriotism has also focused on the principles and values of the Constitution of the United States.

Hershey Run is a stream located in New Castle County, Delaware. It is a tributary of White Clay Creek.
It rises on the edge of the Belvedere subdivision on the outskirts of Newport, Delaware and flows southward along the western edge of that town. To the west of the run lies Bread and Cheese Island, cut off by a partly filled back channel between Hershey Run and Red Clay Creek. New Castle County's Pleasant Hills Park lies along the run in the vicinity of the junction with the back channel. At the southern end of the park, the run enters a tidal marsh which extends to its mouth, near the end of the White Clay.
The nearby Koppers railroad tie treatment plant heavily contaminated the run with creosote.

Constitution of Belgium

The Constitution of Belgium dates back to 1831. Since then Belgium has been a parliamentary monarchy that applies the principles of ministerial responsibility for the government policy and the Trias Politica. The Constitution established Belgium as a centralised unitary state. However, since 1970, through successive state reforms, Belgium has gradually evolved into a federal state.
The last radical change of the constitution was carried out in 1993 after which it was published in a renewed version in the Belgian Official Journal. One of the most important changes was the introduction of the Court of Arbitration whose competencies were expanded by a special law of 2003, to include Title II (Articles 8 to 32), and the Articles 170, 172 and 191 of the Constitution. The Court therefore developed into a constitutional court and in May 2007 it was formally redesignated Constitutional Court. This court has the authority to examine whether a law or a decree is in compliance with Title II and Articles 170, 172 and 191.
The federal Belgium, its composition and territory.
In 1831 Belgium was a unitary state organised at three levels: the national level, provinces and municipalities. State reform in Belgium added a devolved level to the existing structure. Since 1993, the first article of the Constitution stipulates that Belgium is a federal state composed of Communities and Regions. This means that there are two types of devolved entities at the same level, with neither taking precedence over the other.
Article 2 divides Belgium into three communities: the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German-speaking Community, whereas Article 3 divides Belgium into three regions: the Flemish Region, the Walloon Region and the Brussels Region. Article 4 divides Belgium into four language areas: The Dutch language area, the French language area, the bilingual (French and Dutch) area of Brussels-Capital and the German language area. Each municipality of the Kingdom is part of one of these four language areas only. The borders of the language areas can be changed or corrected only by a law supported by specific majorities of each language group of each Chamber.
Article 5 divides the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region into five provinces each and foresees possible future provincial redivisions of the Belgian territory. Article 6 determines that the provinces can be subdivided only by Law. The borders of the State, provinces and municipalities can be changed or corrected only by Law (article 7).
General policy objectives.
In 2007, a Title 1bis was inserted in the Belgian Constitution, titled "General policy objectives of the federal Belgium, the communities and the regions", which to date comprises only one article: Article 7bis. This article states the following: "In the exercise of their respective competences, the federal State, the communities and the regions shall strive for the objectives of a sustainable development in its social, economic and environmental dimensions, taking into account the solidarity between the generations." The act inserting this article was published in the Belgian Official Journal on 26 April 2007.
The Belgians and their rights.
Title II of the Belgian Constitution is titled "The Belgians and their rights". In this title a number of rights and freedoms are enumerated. Although the Constitution speaks of the rights of the Belgians, in principle they apply to all persons on Belgian soil. In addition to the rights enumerated in Title II of the Constitution, the Belgians also enjoy the rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.
Articles 8 and 9 determine how the Belgian nationality can be obtained. Article 8 also stipulates that the law can grant the right to vote in elections to citizens of the European Union who don't have the Belgian nationality, in accordance with Belgium's international and supranational obligations, and to non-EU citizens. Article 9 stipulates that naturalisation can only be granted by the federal legislative power, however, Article 74 of the Constitution stipulates that only the Chamber of Representatives, and not the Senate, can grant naturalisation.
Article 10 determines that all Belgians are equal before the law. Article 11 determines that all rights and freedoms must be guaranteed without discrimination. Article 12 guarantees the liberty of the person and stipulates that no one can be prosecuted except in the cases determined by the law and in accordance with the procedures established by law. Article 13 determines that everyone has the right to go to court. Article 14 guarantees the application of the principle of "nulla poena sine lege" (Latin: "no penalty without a law"). There is also an Article 14bis, which was inserted in the Belgian Constitution in 2005, that states as follows: "The death penalty is abolished".
Articles 15 of the Constitution guard against unreasonable searches. It determines that the domicile is inviolable and that searches can only take place in the cases and the manner the law prescribes. Article 16 stipulates that no one can be deprived of his or her property except when it's in the public interest, in the cases and the manner the law prescribes, and that fair and prior compensation must be made.
Article 17 of the Constitution stipulates that the penalty of forfeiture of (all) assets cannot be instituted. Article 18 further stipulates that the penalty of civil death is abolished, and that it cannot be brought back into force. Civil death was a penalty in Belgium in the Ancien Régime.
Articles 19 to 21 guarantee the freedom of religion. Article 19 protects the freedom of religion and the right to exercise it publicly. It also guarantees the freedom of speech by stipulating that everyone has the right to express his or her opinion freely. However, Article 19 also determines that abuses of these freedoms can be punished, a principle which is controversially applied in the Belgian Holocaust denial law, which made it an offence to publicly "deny, minimise, justify or approve of the genocide committed by the German National Socialist regime during the Second World War".
Article 22 determines that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private life and for his or her family life. Exceptions can only be instituted by law. Article 22bis stipulates that every child has the right to respect for his or her "moral, physical, mental and sexual integrity".
Article 23 protects the right to lead a life in conformity with human dignity. This right specifically encompasses the following rights:
Article 24 protects the freedom of education and the parents' right to choose. It also stipulates that the community must provide neutral education, and that this neutrality includes, among others, the respect for the philosophical, ideological and religious views of parents and pupils. The third paragraph of this article determines that everyone has the right to education, with respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms, and that education shall be free in its compulsory stages. (In Belgium, education is compulsory until the age of 18.)
Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees the freedom of the press and stipulates that censorship can never be established. Article 26 protects the freedom of assembly by determining that everyone has the right to gather peaceably and without arms. Article 27 guarantees the freedom of association. Article 28 ensures the right to petition the public authorities. Article 29 determines that the confidentiality of letters is inviolable.
Article 30 stipulates that the use of the languages spoken in Belgium is free. It further stipulates that the use of a specific language can only be imposed by law and only for the proceedings and acts of the public authorities and for legal proceedings. Article 31 of the Constitution determines that no prior authorisation is required to prosecute civil servants for acts of their administration. Article 32 stipulates that everyone has the right to consult any administrative document and to obtain a copy thereof, except as provided by law or decree.
Since 2003, the Belgian Court of Arbitration, which is known now as the Constitutional Court, can examine whether laws, decrees or ordinances are in compliance with Title II and with Articles 170, 172 and 191 (on the equality of Belgians and foreigners and the prohibition of tax discrimination) of the Constitution. When interpreting the rights enumerated in Title II of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court also applies the European Convention on Human Rights in order to prevent different interpretations of the same principles.
The Powers.
Title III of the Belgian Constitution is titled "The Powers". It consists of Articles 33 to 166 and is subdivided into eight chapters, four of which are further subdivided into several sections. It is by far the largest title of the Constitution. In this title, the Belgian system of government is outlined, in accordance with the principle of the separation of powers.
Article 34 of the Constitution expressly stipulates that the exercise of certain powers or responsibilities can be attributed to international public institutions by treaty or by law. This refers, among others, to Belgium's membership in the European Union.
Article 36 grants the federal legislative power to the King, the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. Although it states that the federal legislative power must be exercised jointly by its three components, in practice only the Federal Parliament, which consists of the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, exercises the federal legislative power. However, laws still require the King's signature.
Article 37 vests the federal executive power in the King, but in practice it is exercised by the Federal Government.
Article 38 and 39 define the competencies and responsibilities of the Communities and the Regions. Article 38 provides that each Community has the competencies that are granted to it by the Constitution or by the laws adopted pursuant to the Constitution. Article 39 provides that a law adopted with a qualified majority can assign competencies to the regional organs which it establishes.
Article 40 vests the judicial power in the courts and tribunals and provides that their rulings and decisions are carried out in the King's name.
Legislative branch.
Chapter I, which is titled "The federal Chambers", establishes the composition, manner of election, qualifications of members and organisation of the bicameral Federal Parliament, which consists of the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. It is divided into three parts: the first part contains the provisions that are common to both Chambers whereas the two other parts, Section I, titled "The Chamber of Representatives", and Section II, titled "The Senate", include provisions that only apply to one of the two Chambers.
The members of the Chamber of Representatives and the directly-elected members of the Senate are elected by all Belgian citizens who are not less than 18 years old and who don't fall into any of the categories of exclusion determined by law. Article 61 further stipulates that each voter has only one vote. In principle, there is a federal election every 4 years, but it is possible that the Federal Parliament is dissolved early and that thus early elections are held. In order to be eligible for election one must have the Belgian nationality, have the full enjoyment of civil and political rights, be at least 21 years old and be resident in Belgium. No other condition of eligibility can be imposed.
Chapter II, which is titled "The federal legislative power", describes the powers of the legislative branch. Article 74 determines the cases in which the federal legislative power is exercised only by the King and the Chamber of Representatives, and not by the Senate. Article 75 stipulates that each branch of the federal legislative power has the right of initiative. This means that both the members of the Chamber of Representatives or of the Senate and the King, in practice the Federal Government, have the right to propose bills. Article 77 determines the matters with respect to which the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate have equal competence. Articles 78 to 83 further outline parliamentary procedure and the relations between both parts of the Federal Parliament.
Monarchy.
Chapter III, which is titled "The King and the Federal Government", consists of the Articles 85 to 114. It is divided into three sections. Section I, titled "The King", establishes the monarchy, the method of succession and contains provisions regarding the regency. Section II, titled "The Federal Government", establishes the Federal Government and the method of appointment of its members. Section III, titled "The competences", defines the constitutional powers of the King, which are, in practice, exercised by the Federal Government.
Article 85 provides that the King's constitutional powers are hereditary through the direct, natural and legitimate descent from King Leopold I, by order of primogeniture. However, in Title IX, which contains certain transitional provisions, there is a clause that stipulates that Article 85 in its current shall be applicable for the first time on the descent of King Albert II, which means that the female offspring of King Albert II and later monarchs are in the line of succession to the Belgian throne, whereas the female offspring of all previous Belgian kings are excluded from the throne. This transitional clause was inserted to regulate the transition from the Salic law, which barred women and their descendants from the throne and was in effect until 1991.
Article 85 further provides that a descendant of Leopold I who marries without the King's consent, or the consent of those exercising the King's powers in the cases provided by the Constitution, is deprived of his rights to the crown. It also stipulates that those who lose their right to the crown in this manner, can be restored to the line of succession with the consent of both Chambers of the Federal Parliament. Again, a transitional provision was inserted in Title IX stipulating that the marriage of Princess Astrid of Belgium and Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este, is deemed to have received such consent. This provision was inserted because, as their marriage took place in 1984, before women were included in the line of succession, their marriage didn't require the King's consent at the time.
Article 86 provides that, in the event that there are no descendants of King Leopold I, the King can name a successor with the consent of both Chambers of the Federal Parliament. This consent cannot be given unless a quorum of at least two-thirds of its members is present and at least two-thirds of the votes cast are in the affirmative. In case no successor has been appointed in this manner, the throne is vacant. Article 95 stipulates that, in the event that the throne is vacant, the United Chambers meet to provisionally provide for the regency. Subsequently, a federal election must take place and the newly elected Federal Parliament must meet within two months to permanently fill the vacancy.
The United Chambers also have to provide for the regency in two other cases, in accordance with Articles 92 and 93: in the event that the successor to the throne is a minor or in the event that the King is unable to reign. In both cases, the United Chambers also have to make provisions regarding the guardianship. Article 94 stipulates that the regency can only be conferred on one person and that the Regent can only enter into office after taking the same constitutional oath that the King must take before he can accede to the throne. Article 93 also stipulates that the ministers must establish the inability to reign and subsequently convene the Chambers of the Federal Parliament.
Article 90 provides that, upon the death of the monarch, the Federal Parliament must convene without convocation no later than ten days following the monarch's death. In the event that the Chambers had been dissolved and the act of dissolution provided for the convocation of the new Chambers at a date later than the tenth day following the monarch's demise, the old Chambers enter into function again until the new Chambers convene. It also provides that, between the monarch's demise and the taking of the oath of his successor or the Regent, the constitutional powers of the King are exercised by the Council of Ministers, in the name of the Belgian people.
Article 90 and Article 93, regarding the inability to reign, were controversially applied in 1990 during the so-called Abortion Question, which arose when King Baudouin I refused to sign a bill liberalising Belgium's abortion laws into law, citing religious convictions. The Belgian Government subsequently declared him unable to reign on 4 April 1990 and the ministers signed and promulgated the bill instead. The following day, King Baudouin I was restored to royal power by the United Chambers.
In accordance with Article 87 of the Constitution, the King cannot simultaneously be the head of state of another country without the consent of both Chambers of the Federal Parliament. A personal union is only possible with the approval of two-thirds of the votes cast in both Chambers, and a quorum of two-thirds of the members of the Chamber must be present in order for the approval to be valid. This article was used only once, in 1885, when King Leopold II of Belgium also became the sovereign ruler of the Congo Free State.
Executive branch.
The second section of Chapter III deals with the composition and the functioning of the Federal Government. Article 96 provides that the King appoints and dismisses his ministers. It further provides that the Federal Government must tender its resignation to the King when the Chamber of Representatives, by an absolute majority of its members, adopts a constructive motion of no confidence which presents a successor to the Prime Minister to the King for appointment, or presents a successor to the Prime Minister to the King for appointment within three days following the rejection of a motion of confidence. The King then appoints the proposed successor to Prime Minister. In this case, the new Prime Minister enters into office on the moment that the new Federal Government takes the oath.
Articles 97 to 99 contain provisions regarding the membership of the Federal Government. Article 97 stipulates that only Belgian nationals can be ministers and Article 98 provides that no member of the Belgian royal family can be a minister. Article 99 provides that the Council of Ministers cannot have more than 15 members and that the Council of Ministers must comprise as many Dutch-speaking as French-speaking members, with the possible exception of the Prime Minister.
Section III deals with the competences and the powers of the King, which are, in practice, exercised by the Federal Government. Article 105 expressly determines that the King has no powers other than those expressly attributed to him by the Constitution and the laws adopted pursuant thereof. This article establishes the principle that the federal executive power has no powers or competences other than those attributed to it by the federal legislative power.
Article 106 determines that no act of the King can have effect if it isn't countersigned by a minister, who in doing so takes the responsibility for the act upon himself. This means that not the King, but the minister is responsible for those acts. This is the direct result of the inviolability of the King's person, which is established by Article 88, and the principle of ministerial responsibility, which is established by Article 101.
Communities and Regions.
Chapter IV, which is titled "The Communities and the Regions", contains the Articles 115 to 140. It is divided into two sections, which are in turn subdivided into subsections. Section I is titled "The organs" and establishes the organs of the Communities and the Regions and their functioning. It is subdivided into two subsections on, respectively, the Community and Regional Parliaments and the Community and Regional Governments. Section II is titled "The competences" and further defines the competences and responsibilities of the Communities and the Regions. It is subdivided into three subsections on, respectively, the competences of the Communities, the competences of the Regions and one containing special provisions relative to these competences.
Article 115 of section I establishes the Parliament of the Flemish Community, known as the Flemish Parliament, the Parliament of the French Community and the Parliament of the German-speaking Community. It further provides that there shall be a parliament for each Region, this resulted in the Walloon Parliament and the Brussels Parliament. The Flemish Parliament exercises both the competences of the Parliament of the Flemish Community and the Parliament of the Flemish Region. Article 116 stipulates that the community and regional parliaments are composed of elected members. The members of a community parliament must be directly elected to that community parliament or to a regional parliament, which is the case for the Parliament of the French Community, and the same applies to the regional parliaments.
The members of the community and regional parliaments are elected for a term of office of 5 years and, in accordance with Article 117 of the Constitution, these elections must coincide with the elections to the European Parliament, except when provided otherwise by special law. Article 119 provides that a member of the parliament of a community or region cannot be a member of the Federal Parliament at the same time, the only exception are the Community Senators who represent the parliament of their Community or Region in the Senate, and Article 120 grants the members of community and regional parliaments the same parliamentary immunity as members of the Federal Parliament.
Article 121 establishes the Flemish Government, the Government of the French Community and the Government of the German-speaking Community and provides that each region shall also have a government. The Flemish Government is the government of both the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region. The members of each community or regional government are elected by their respective parliament.
Section II determines the competences and the responsibilities of the Communities and Regions. Article 127 of subsection I provides that the Flemish Parliament and the Parliament of the French Community are responsible for cultural matters and education, however, the Communities are, with regard to education, not responsible for determining the age at which compulsory education begins and ends, the minimum conditions for awarding degrees and pensions. Article 128 stipulates that the Flemish Parliament and the Parliament of the French Community are responsible for the matters related to the individual. In addition, the Flemish Parliament and the Parliament of the French Community are also responsible for the cooperation between the communities and have the power to make treaties with regard to their competences.
In accordance with Article 129, the Flemish Parliament and the Parliament of the French Community are also responsible for legislation regarding the use of languages in administration and the conduct of official business, in education and in the relations between employers and their personnel, within certain limits. They can't pass legislation regarding the use of languages with regard to cases where the Federal Parliament is responsible, municipalities with linguistic facilities, certain services and federal and international institutions.
Article 130 establishes the competences of the Parliament of the German-speaking Community. It stipulates that the Parliament of the German-speaking Community is responsible for cultural matters, the matters related to the individual, education, within the same limits as the other community parliaments, the cooperation between the communities and international cooperation, including the power to make treaties with regard to its competences, and the use of languages in education. Unlike for the other communities, the laws regarding the competences of the German-speaking Community don't require a special majority in the Federal Parliament.
Judicial branch.
Chapter V, which is titled "The Constitutional Court, conflict prevention and resolution", contains the Articles 141 to 143. It is divided into three sections, each of which contains only one article: Section I on the prevention of competency conflicts, Section II on the Constitutional Court and Section III on the prevention and resolution of conflicts of interest. Article 143 determines that the federal State, the Communities, the Regions and the Common Community Commission, in the exercise of their respective competences, must observe the federal loyalty.
Chapter VI, which is titled "The judicial power", describes the organisation of the Belgian court system. It contains the Articles 144 to 159. Article 147 establishes the Court of Cassation. Article 150 establishes the jury for all felonies and for political offences and press-related offences. In 1999, this article was amended to include a provision that "press-related offences inspired by racism or xenophobia" are not tried by a jury. Article 151 establishes the High Council of Justice and the manner in which judges are appointed. Article 156 establishes five Courts of Appeal: one in Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp, Liège and Mons. Article 157 stipulates that military courts can be created in wartime. It also stipulates that there are Commercial Courts, Labour Courts and so-called Penalty Application Tribunals.
Chapter VII, which is titled "The Council of State and the administrative jurisdictions", contains the Articles 160 and 161 and establishes the Council of State. It also provides that no administrative jurisdiction can be established except by law.
Local government.
Chapter VIII, the last chapter of Title III of the Constitution, is titled "The provincial and municipal institutions". As its title suggests, this chapter describes the organisation of the institutions of the provinces and the municipalities of Belgium. It contains the Articles 162 to 166. Article 162 establishes the principles of the organisation of the provincial and municipal institutions, such as the direct election of the members of the provincial and the municipal councils. Article 163 stipulates that the functions of the provincial organs are exercised in the extraprovincial Brussels-Capital Region by the institutions of the Flemish Community, the French Community, the Common Community Commission and the Region. Article 165 provides that the law can create agglomerations and federations of municipalities. It also describes the functioning of these agglomerations and federations. Article 166 describes how the preceding article applies to the municipalities of the Brussels Region.
Historical aspects.
On 25 November 1830 a draft for the constitution, elaborated by a commission nominated by the Provisional Government, was submitted for vote to the National Congress. Finally, the Congress approved the constitution on 7 February 1831. It entered into force on 26 July 1831, with the exception of certain provisions.
The Belgian constitution is a synthesis of the French constitutions of 1791, 1814 and 1830, Dutch constitution of 1814 and the English constitutional laws. However, the resulting constitutional text is an original creation. Its basic principles are still in use today.
Belgium is a constitutional monarchy sometimes called a popular monarchy.
In 1849 Denmark drafted their own constitution, largely based on the Belgian and the Norwegian constitutions.
Only in 1967 an official Dutch version of the Belgian Constitution was adopted. Up to then, the Dutch text was only a translation without legal value. Since 1991 there is also an official German version of the Constitution.
Constitutional theorist A.V. Dicey has observed that the Belgian constitution "comes very near to a written reproduction of the English constitution."
Constitutional amendments.
The Belgian Constitution can be amended by the federal legislative power, which consists of the King (in practice, the Federal Government) and the Federal Parliament. The amendment process is governed by the provisions of Title VIII of the Constitution, which is titled "The revision of the Constitution". In order to amend the Constitution, the federal legislative power must declare that there are reasons to revise the Constitution, in accordance with Article 195 of the Constitution. This is done by means of two so-called Declarations of Revision of the Constitution, one adopted by the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, and one signed by the King and the Federal Government.
Following this declaration, the Federal Parliament is automatically dissolved and a new federal election must take place. This makes it impossible to amend the Constitution unless an election has intervened. Following the election, the new Federal Parliament can amend those articles that have been declared revisable. Neither Chamber can consider amendments to the Constitution unless at least two-thirds of its members are present and the Constitution can only be amended if at least two-thirds of the votes cast are in favour of the amendment.
There are further restrictions on the power of the Federal Parliament to amend the Constitution. Article 196 of the Constitution provides that the process to amend the Constitution cannot be initiated or continued in times of war or when the Federal Parliament is unable to freely meet in Belgium. Article 197 also provides that the provisions relating to the King's constitutional powers cannot be amended during a regency.
The federal legislative power also has the power to modify the numbers and the subdivisions of the articles of the Constitution, the subdivision of the Constitution into titles, chapters and sections, and the terminology of articles that haven't been declared revisable, in order to bring it in agreement with the terminology used in new provisions and to harmonise the Dutch, French and German texts of the Constitution, in accordance with Article 198. Neither Chamber can debate on such modifications unless at least two-thirds of its members are present and the Constitution can only be modified in this manner if at least two-thirds of the votes cast are in the affirmative.
The procedure to change and consolidate the structure of the Belgian Constitution and its subdivisions and articles is called coordination. It has only been used once in Belgian history, in 1993, when it was decided to publish a consolidated version of the entire Constitution in the Belgian Official Journal. A coordinated version was proposed to the Federal Parliament by the Federal Government on 25 June 1993, it was adopted by the Chamber of Representatives on 20 January 1994, and by the Senate on 3 February 1994. This coordinated text of the Belgian Constitution was published in the Belgian Official Journal on 17 February 1994.
The Belgian Constitution has been amended 29 times since the coordinated text of 17 February 1994 was published in the Belgian Official Journal: once in 1996, three times in 1997, four times in 1998, twice in 1999 and in 2000, once in 2001, twice in 2002 and in 2004, and three times in 2005 and in 2007, once in 2008 and five times in 2012. The most recent change to the Constitution took place on 9 July 2012.

Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation

The Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (also DOSCO) was a Canadian coal mining and steel manufacturing company.
Incorporated in 1928 and operational by 1930, DOSCO was predated by the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO), which was a merger of the Dominion Coal Company, the Dominion Iron and Steel Company and the Nova Scotia Steel Company. DOSCO was one of the largest private employers in Canada during the 1930s-1950s. In 1957, DOSCO was purchased as a subsidiary of A.V. Roe Canada Ltd. and was later assumed in 1962 by Hawker Siddeley Canada. The company was dissolved in 1968 after the majority of its coal mining and steel mill industrial assets in Industrial Cape Breton were expropriated and nationalized by the federal and provincial governments.
Corporate predecessors.
Industrial Cape Breton consisted of two distinctive geographic regions for industrial activity: the "north side" of Sydney Harbour, and the "south side". The north side was dominated in the 1800s by the General Mining Association (GMA), which had been formed in the 1820s after the Colony of Cape Breton Island was amalgamated back into Nova Scotia. Several independent collieries opened on the south side and by the 1870s, Canada's federal government had implemented its National Policy of economic protectionist measures. It was during this decade that the leading operators on the "south side" foresaw the benefits of amalgamating and modernizing to replace lost American coal markets in eastern Canada with Cape Breton coal.
Dominion Coal Company.
On February 1, 1893, Dominion Coal Company Ltd. (DOMCO) was incorporated with Whitney as president, B.F. Whitney as secretary and F.S. Pearson as chief engineer. Early investors in the enterprise included Whitney's younger brother, William Collins Whitney; his brothers-in-law, Henry F. Dimock and Charles T. Barney; and Almeric H. Paget, who later married William's daughter Pauline. The new company included the following properties:
DOMCO also inherited a mixed variety of railway lines linking the various mines. These were consolidated and operated as a department of the company, and in 1895 were extended south to Louisbourg. The railroad lines were incorporated in 1910 as the Sydney and Louisburg Railway.
By 1912, DOMCO operated 16 collieries, comprising 40% of Canada's coal production. The company effected numerous efficiencies and improvements. There were, however, costly mistakes, prominent among them the tendency to become locked into low-price contracts (such as to Whitney's companies), thus missing a large market at higher prices. By 1901 some 90 percent of its output was committed to such low-price contracts. The company made a large public offering of stock, which tumbled in price when Whitney failed to get the American import duty on coal removed or at least reduced.
Dominion Iron and Steel Company.
Flushed with the success of creating DOMCO in the 1890s, the Whitney syndicate sought to create a use for "slack coal" resulting from mixing and screening processes at DOMCO's coal wash plants. Whitney expanded operations at Sydney with the organization in March 1899 of the Dominion Iron & Steel Company Ltd. (DISCO), which had funding in both Canada and the United States. Whitney was joined in the new enterprise by his long-time business friends F.S. Pearson, B.F. Pearson, W.C. Whitney, C.T. Barney, H.F. Dimock, A.H. Paget and J.S. McLennan. The promise of federal bounties, together with concessions from the Liberal provincial administration of Premier George Henry Murray, enabled DISCO to begin work in June 1899 on the largest integrated steel mill in the British Empire. Located on the south side of Sydney Harbour, which Whitney said offered more advantages to steel making than anywhere else in the world, the mill was completed in 1901.
DISCO operated coke ovens which cooked this slack coal to create coke to fuel its oxygen blast furnaces that were used to smelt iron ore mined by DISCO at its mine on Bell Island in Newfoundland and shipped to Sydney.
Competitors in Britain, France, Germany and the United States were initially concerned. However, continuing problems of management and cost control led to Whitney's early withdrawal from the project. Later in 1901, Whitney and his associates sold majority control of DOMCO to engineer turned businessman James Ross of Montreal, and their minority share of DISCO to Ross and other Canadian interests. Whitney resigned as president of DISCO in 1902 and as a member of the DOMCO board in December 1909; he remained a member of the DISCO board until 1909.
The year 1901 also saw further changes in the coal and steel industry on Cape Breton Island when the rival GMA, operator of coal mines on the "north side" of Sydney Harbour, as well as a newly inaugurated steel mill at that location, sold its properties to Nova Scotia Steel Company Ltd. (SCOTIA) of New Glasgow.
In 1903, Ross and the Canadian investors in DISCO sold control to James H. Plummer of Toronto, Ontario. By 1910, Plummer gained control of DOMCO from Ross and made both DOMCO and DISCO subsidiary companies of a new entity called Dominion Steel Corporation, which also counted mainland Nova Scotia's Cumberland Railway and Coal Company as a subsidiary.
Presidents
General managers
British Empire Steel Corporation.
Further consolidation of industrial activity on Cape Breton Island saw SCOTIA taken over in 1917 by American investors as its steel mill had closed in 1914, and the company focused on coal mining in Sydney Mines and manufactured steel products at its extensive facilities in Trenton, Pictou County.
The fall-out from World War I saw a syndicate of British investors led by Montreal, Quebec industrialist Roy M. Wolvin negotiate a takeover of Dominion Steel Corporation from Plummer in 1919. BESCO proposed a $500 million merger of DOMCO and DISCO, along with various British steel and shipbuilding interests. In 1921, SCOTIA was merged with the conglomerate to form the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO).
The scope and scale of BESCO was truly mind-boggling. In addition to its coal mines and steel mills operating as a complete monopoly across the entire Sydney Coal Field, BESCO also operated coal mines, steel mills and foundries in the Pictou Coal Field in Trenton, New Glasgow, Stellarton and Westville, as well as North America's deepest coal mines in Springhill. It also operated several industrial railways and various shipping ports throughout the province.
However, the mergers that resulted in the formation of BESCO also amalgamated an inordinate amount of debt. During its 8-year history, BESCO was in a constant financial crisis and by 1925 required an annual operating profit of $8 million ($100 million when adjusted for inflation in 2010) to meet these financial commitments. As a result, BESCO's investors pressured management to force many difficult working conditions in order to achieve higher production from its workforce. This resulted in unprecedented labour unrest and militancy which would forever transform Industrial Cape Breton (see Davis Day).
Profits fell and coal and steel markets were declining throughout the 1920s as North America's industrial and consumer practices changed. BESCO management tried to desperately save the company, however bitter strikes by workers, culminating in widespread social and civil unrest in 1925, saw BESCO slip further into debt.
BESCO subsidiary DISCO (the steel mill) fell into receivership in the spring of 1926 after short-term financing was refused; this would eventually lead to the break-up of the conglomerate. DISCO was liquidated in 1927 but the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia refused to dissolve BESCO. Wolvin resigned as president and sold his holdings after his reorganization plan was rejected by other shareholders and he was succeeded by C.B. McNaught.
Creation of DOSCO.
In 1928 a new holding company called Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (also DOSCO) was formed as a holding company by McNaught and various BESCO investors. In May 1930 BESCO was dissolved and the new company took over its industrial properties. DOSCO implemented management processes that put a halt to the financial troubles through the 1930s. The company's fortunes were boosted by World War II with its control of manufacturing and their inputs and at one point DOSCO was the largest private employer in the nation.
Following the war, DOSCO's industrial prominence continued to slide as alternative fuels and sources for steel took force, combining with declines in government subsidization of both industries. In 1957, A.V. Roe Canada acquired a controlling interest in DOSCO in a bid to diversify its operations beyond the aircraft manufacturing and defence industries. In 1958, DOSCO subsidiary Cumberland Railway and Coal Company closed its mines in Springhill; the mines being closed following the Springhill Mining Disaster. The associated railway service limped on until permission to abandon was granted in 1961, and the last train ran in 1962. The Cumberland Railway continued to exist as a corporation, however, as the S&L was made its subsidiary in 1961, doing business as the Sydney & Louisburg Division of the Cumberland Railway. This was done primarily to make the provincially-chartered S&L eligible for federal railway subsidies.
In 1962 A.V. Roe Canada was dissolved and its assets merged into the newly formed conglomerate Hawker Siddeley Canada, which sought to rid itself of money-losing operations.
By the early 1960s DOSCO was in a continuous slide and sought to halt its decline by shutting various poorly performing mines in the Pictou and Sydney coal fields; from 9 in 1960 to 5 in 1965. Despite shedding other money-losing subsidiaries it was still losing money and under pressure from Hawker Siddeley Canada to reduce red ink. In 1965, DOSCO announced that its remaining mines had only 15 years of production left and it would not undertake any further capital expenditures and would exit the industry within months.
The vast public outcry to DOSCO's announcement in Industrial Cape Breton saw the minority government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson come under incredible political pressure to resolve the crisis. Pearson announced the formation of the Donald Commission of inquiry into the industry, which would eventually lead to the formation of the federal Crown corporation Cape Breton Development Corporation (or DEVCO) and the provincial Crown corporation Sydney Steel Corporation (SYSCO) which expropriated DOSCO's mines and steel mill in 1968.

Writing motivation

Writing motivation is one's activation or energizing to give more effort to writing activity. It focuses on one’s appraisal of the relationship between writing activity and writing outcome. Like reading motivation Writing motivation is said to be intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic writing motivation comes from within. It includes one's desire to make archive (documentation), to express emotions (emotional expression), to satisfy creation urge (creativity) and to develop mastery over writing 
(achievement). Extrinsic writing motivation is for satisfying others. It includes one's desire to write to be loved (affiliation), to be recognized by others (recognition) and to avoid punishment. Writing activity includes memory retrieval, goal setting, planning, problem solving and evaluation.
Levels of Motivation.
Motivation to write occurs at three levels:
Strategies.
Improve hand-eye coordination.
Improve hand-eye coordination in writing following writing skills, e.g., clockwise and anti clockwise circling, angular writing, keeping symmetry and inter word spacing.
Improve key processes.
Improve key processes of writing as
In the planning stage, the writer organizes main goals and sub goals of writing to form a coherent writing plan. A good writer uses strategic knowledge in a flexible way. The structure of writing plan often changes during the writing period as new ideas come to the writer, or dissatisfaction grows with the original writing plan. If the plan proves inadequate, then the writing process grinds to a halt. The greatest difference between experts and non experts is in plan integration : experts goals were much better integrated. Two major strategies are used in the planning stage: the knowledge-telling strategy (writing down everything he or she knows about a topic) and the knowledge transferring strategy (asking questions about the writing goals, e.g., can the main ideas be expressed more simply ?). Writers using a knowledge transferring strategy should produce more organized texts than those produced by using a knowledge telling strategy. Well organized texts contain high-level main points that describe important themes. 
After planning and sentence generation, a good writer spends time in revising so that the ideas become clearer, coherent and well argued. Expert writers detected about 60% more problems in a text than did non-experts.
Change from extrinsic to intrinsic writing motivation.
Avoid extraneous reinforcement for writing. Do not do any thing so that child can relate that his writing performance is related to the outcome of praise, recognition and love of others. Rather develop his mind set so that child can relate the writing outcome with his level of changes in writing competency, in expressing emotions, making documents and in creative productions.

Sheryl Lyna Stamps Leach (born December 31, 1952) is an American children's TV show creator and author much known for being the creator of the popular children's show "Barney & Friends". Kathy Parker and Dennis DeShazer joined her in creating the show. 
Career.
Leach, a former teacher, worked with Parker on the idea that would become the eventual TV show in 1987. Originally, the star was going to be a teddy bear, but since her toddler son had an interest in dinosaurs, the character changed to a dinosaur. Leach then brought together a team who created a series of home videos called "Barney and the Backyard Gang". The videos were sold directly to the public. Later, in 1991, Connecticut Public Television employee Larry Rifkin rented a Barney video for his daughter. He liked the concept, so he spoke with Leach and other creators about putting Barney on television. In October of that year, production began on the new TV show, titled "Barney & Friends", and in April 1992, it first aired on Public Broadcasting Service.
Currently, Leach's company SL Productions LLC is developing a feature film of "The Unicorn Sonata", based on the novel by Peter S. Beagle. Additionally, with her husband, Howard Rosenfeld, she has created and funded the Shei'rah Foundation, a not-for-profit organization using media to encourage understanding between differing cultures.
Leach, the daughter of Texas educators Billy and Mary (Whiteside) Stamps, was born in Henderson County, Texas, and raised in Dallas. A graduate of Kimball High School in Dallas, she holds a bachelor's degree from Southern Methodist University and a master's and honorary doctorate from Texas A&M University–Commerce.

The Team are currently members of the British American Football Association Community League.
The Shropshire Revolution are in Central Division of the BAFANL.
History.
The "Shropshire Revolution" American Football team were formed in January 2006 by like minded enthusiasts and fans of the game, via a forum on the website of NFLUK.
7 players met for the first session in the Town Park Bowl on Saturday 21 January 2006, when the following week a management team was formed.
Initial discussions were along the lines of Flag Football until the team were ready to think about entering an application for kitted league football.
Media interest from BBC Local Television, BBC Radio Shropshire, the Shropshire Star newspaper, and Beacon Radio swelled the numbers of those interested in viewing and participating in the game considerably over the following weeks and a competition, run on Beacon Radio to choose the team name from a short list, declared that the team shall be known as the " 'Shropshire Revolution' ".
The management team have since been working towards becoming an Associate Member of the British American Football League. This application was successful and the team granted associate membership on 2 July 2006.
The team's first game took place on 1 October 2006. In front of around 200 people, the Revolution beat the Lincolnshire Bombers 30-6.
This was followed on 15 October by the team's first away game against the Leicestershire Falcons, which the Revolution won 28-14.
And finally a home game against the Leicestershire Falcons on 28 October saw the Revolution romp home with a 29-0 victory, bringing their 2006 associate season to a glorious finale.
On 1 November the league confirmed that the Revolutions application for league membership for the 2007 season, had been successful.

Girl with a Pearl Earring

The painting Girl with a Pearl Earring () is one of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer's masterworks and, as the name implies, uses a pearl earring for a focal point. It has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague since 1902.
Background.
The painting is signed "IVMeer" but not dated. It is unclear whether this work was commissioned, and, if so, by whom. In any case, it is probably not meant as a conventional portrait.
The image is a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description of a ‘head’ that was not meant to be a portrait. After the most recent restoration of the painting in 1994, the subtle color scheme and the intimacy of the girl’s gaze toward the viewer have been greatly enhanced. During the restoration, it was discovered that the dark background, today somewhat mottled, was initially intended by the painter to be a deep enamel-like green. This effect was produced by applying a thin transparent layer of paint, called a glaze, over the present-day black background. However, the two organic pigments of the green glaze, indigo and weld, have faded.
On the advice of Victor de Stuers, who for years tried to prevent Vermeer's rare works from being sold to parties abroad, Arnoldus Andries des Tombe purchased the work at an auction in The Hague in 1881, for only two guilders and thirty cents. At the time, it was in poor condition. Des Tombe had no heirs and donated this and other paintings to the Mauritshuis in 1902.
In 1937, a very similar painting, "Smiling Girl", at the time also thought to be by Vermeer, was donated by collector Andrew W. Mellon to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Now widely considered to be a fake, the painting was claimed by Vermeer expert Arthur Wheelock in a 1995 study to be by 20th-century artist and forger Theo van Wijngaarden, a friend of Han van Meegeren.
In 2012, as part of a traveling exhibition while the Mauritshuis was being renovated and expanded, the painting was exhibited in Japan at the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, and in 2013-2014 the United States, where it was shown at the High Museum in Atlanta, the de Young Museum in San Francisco and in New York City at the Frick Collection. Later in 2014 it was exhibited in Bologna, Italy. In June 2014, it was returned to the Mauritshuis museum, where it was given a more prominent place than before.
References in fiction.
Tracy Chevalier wrote a historical novel, also entitled "Girl with a Pearl Earring" (1999), fictionalizing the circumstances of the painting's creation. In the novel, Johannes Vermeer becomes close with a fictional servant named Griet (based on Chevalier's close friend Georgia Kendall), whom he hires as an assistant and has sit for him as a painting model while wearing his wife's pearl earrings. The novel inspired a 2003 film and 2008 play of the same name. The 2003 film stars Scarlett Johansson as the girl with the pearl earring, Griet. Johansson was nominated for various awards including a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.
The painting also appears in the 2007 film St Trinian's, when the girls devise to - and successfully do - steal and fence the painting, to raise funds to save the school.

<doc id="5959729" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5959729" title="The Jitsu Foundation">
The Jitsu Foundation

The Jitsu Foundation or TJF is a national-level association of sports clubs headquartered in the United Kingdom, but also has affiliated organisations in other countries around the world (Australia, Canada, Cyprus, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, USA). Focusing on standing throws and locks using weakening strikes to assist, the style taught within the association is known as Shorinji Kan Jiu Jitsu.
Style.
Shorinji Kan Jiu Jitsu is taught as a self-defence system which acknowledges that situations may include multiple armed or unarmed opponents, rather than a single "one on one" officiated match. Joint locks and throws, complemented by weakening strikes, are employed to deal with attackers in an efficient way. In most cases, a practising pair will include an Uki and a Tori in which the Uki launches an attack and the Tori defends. The style includes some treatment of groundwork (newaza) however to a far lesser degree than some sports-based styles of jujutsu. Much of the competition focus of styles such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Judo is ignored in favour of maintaining focus on the complete surroundings with all possible threats considered. The commonly held prescriptions of "clean fighting" are disregarded in the Jitsu Foundation and the use of all advantages available (including groin strikes, hair pulling, spinal locks, eye rakes, and to a small extent nerve points) is encouraged - although in competitions such as the Randori Nationals, these are not employed. The style has adopted the name 'jitsu', a shortened version of 'jiu jitsu,' or 'jujutsu.'
History.
Pre-cursors.
The style currently practised by The Jitsu Foundation traces its roots to Shihan Matthew Komp (10th dan in jujutsu, highest grade in Australia) from Bonn and Cologne, Germany who learned judo and jujutsu from various instructors including Wolfe, who had trained in Japan prior to the World War II, and Hassermayer. Komp, who also held grades in aikido and karate, emigrated to Australia in 1953, where he founded German style jujitsu schools in Ascot Vale, Maidstone and Footscray, suburbs in Melbourne. In addition to jujutsu, Komp taught judo to his students. They wore their judo grades as belts and their jujutsu grades as a colour flash on their sleeves. An infrequent visitor to the club was Akira Miura (also referred to as Riukia or "Rocky" Myura), who was, according to some accounts, the Chief Unarmed Combat instructor at the Tokyo Police Academy, Japan.
The most likely lineage for Komp's instructors (Wolfe and Hassermayer) point towards the Kodokan. Early English Judo texts show a strong similarity in the techniques of self-defence that are a key element of the Jitsu Foundation style.
Komp taught Brian Graham who, having emigrated from the UK to Australia, later returned to the UK in the late 1960s as a second dan in judo as well as a first dan in jujutsu. Graham named his style Shorinji Kempo Jiu Jitsu, then later changed the name to Shorinji Kan Jiu Jitsu, and this name has been kept to the present day. Graham established his first jujutsu club in Keighley, Yorkshire. One of Graham's first students, Peter Farrar, who started learning jujutsu at the age of 9 in 1969, expanded the style and the association. He started his first collegiate club at Plymouth Polytechnic (now the University of Plymouth), and his students moved and spread the style.
To cope with the administrative and organisational demands of the growing number of clubs, an association was formed called the National Samurai Jiu Jitsu Association (NSJJA). The NSJJA organised and ran national competitions, courses and gradings. There is no current Japanese link.
Organisation.
In 1990 the growing demands from within the organisation for further expansion of Jitsu clubs internationally, and for courses to be made available to the commercial sector, required the reorganisation of the NSJJA. The strengths and resources were consolidated into separate divisions to service the competing interests of the organisation. The Jitsu Foundation was formed to coordinate the activities of:
The Jitsu Foundation was driven by its Directing Tertiary Peter Farrar, and much of its success can be attributed to his charismatic leadership and the hard work of the Tertiary Board. Peter Farrar died in 1997, but the Foundation continued to grow under the direction of Directing Tertiary Dave Walker, the current head of the tertiary board is Steve Allison and in 2006 there were 100 TJF clubs in the UK.
Success in the UK has also been matched by the growth of TJF affiliated organisations throughout the world. The first was the Cyprus Jitsu Association (CJA), started by Andy Wallace in 1989 and then instructed by Jules Robson from 1992-97. The Limassol club was recently reopened by Andreas Stylianou. In 1993, Andy Dobie moved to Canada and opened clubs at Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario and at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. In 1995, Mike Mallen opened his club in Spartanburg, South Carolina, USA. In 2011 Jitsu Australasia (founded in 2002) split into Jitsu New Zealand and Jitsu Oceania. There are 3 clubs in Jitsu New Zealand (Wellington, Napier & Masterton) and the Chief Instructor is Simon Ogden. In Jitsu Oceania there are five clubs: In New Zealand Jules Robson. & Lorne Roberts have a club in Auckland. There are 2 in Sydney - Penrith NSW and Eastern Suburbs, run by Doug Austing and Jason Hime. In 2012 clubs also opened in Brisbane (Fiona Spence) and Melbourne (Tim Trevail). The Chief Instrutor is Jules Robson. Jitsu South Africa was established in 2005 by Davis Cook, with clubs in Pretoria (2005), and Johannesburg (2009). TJF affiliated international associations have also opened in the Netherlands, Angola and Brazil. As of 2007 there were 18 non-UK clubs registered with TJF.
In 1997 Matthew Komp visited the UK and conferred the grade of sixth Dan and the title Shihan to Brian Graham. Brian Graham died on 15 June 2005. In an attempt to modernise its image, TJF changed its logo in 2004 from the depiction of one figure throwing another in black and white against a red and yellow sunshine background reminiscent of the old flag of Japan to a plain red square with the word "Jitsu". TJF has had success in establishing its clubs in British universities, with the help of the NUS student unions - about half of all TJF clubs in the UK are based at a university. In 2005 the Randori and Atemi National competitions gained recognition from BUCS - then British Universities Sports Association. Gareth Horgan, Acting Tertiary Fellow, is the British Ju Jitsu Association Governing Body's "Universities Ju Jitsu Representative", highlighting the contribution that TJF makes to Jiu Jitsu as a whole in the UK.
Branch lineages.
Several instructors who have previously been members of TJF have gone on to form their own schools, these are listed below;
Technical aspects.
Techniques aim to utilise the use of the attackers' energy, momentum, size and weight to assert an advantage to the defender. This allows a small and weak jitsuka (student of jujutsu) to defeat a much bigger and stronger attacker by the application of strikes, locks, throws and immobilizations. Apart from the inevitable variations in technique that happen over time, TJF principles are in line with most modern practitioners of judo and jujutsu, with hip throws forming the basis of nage waza. These hip throws are similar to those found in the modernization of Japanese martial arts in the late 19th and early 20th century and are as such distinct from the balance taking of older Japanese arts, or kobudo.
Punches are taught in such a way to have often already surrendered the balance of the attacker. This is supposed to simulate the "committed punch". However, many older Japanese budo styles have systems of striking which purposefully do not commit, and so break one's own balance, until assured of reasonable success. Counters to these more sophisticated attacks are reserved for senior grade syllabi, in contrast to training traditional JiuJitsu styles in Japan where the emphasis is placed on a philosophy of immersion for all students.
When testing a students technical skills, Jitsu prefers quantity over quality and high speed. The students are often placed in situations involving a high volume of attacks from multiple uki's in which the student must deal with the attacks very quickly before the next attack. In contrast with martial arts, the Jitsu practice is highly athletic and demands high levels of fitness in order to succeed.
Grade structure.
TJF has adopted the common practice of a kyu (coloured belt) grade system as opposed to the traditional white (novice) and black (competent) system. As a result, any instructor visiting a club at which they do not train or teach regularly, can gauge the level of competence of those he or she is about to instruct, and will choose techniques at a level appropriate to the grades present.
TJF has 8 coloured belts. The first two grades 7th and 6th kyu contain sub grades which TJF refer to as "mons". When graded for 7th and 6th kyu, the examining panel will decide if the candidate has passed and whether it was a pass, a good pass, an excellent pass or an exceptional pass. A pass is signified by a plain belt. However, 1, 2 or 3 mons (tags added to the belt) represent good, excellent or exceptional performance in the grading respectively, which are displayed by using the appropriate number of ribbons of the following belt's colour around the end of the belt. The belt is then worn so that the mons are displayed on the wearer's left. Subsequent grades are either passed or failed: the mon system is not used. Mons are given to the lower grades because there is a much greater variation in skill and ability between jitsuka of 7th kyu and of 6th kyu, than there is between jitsuka of the higher grades. Nevertheless, it is possible for a candidate to these higher grades to obtain the status of 'top-grade' (such as top-green, top-purple or top-blue) when his or her performance at the grading is considered superior to that of other candidates.
The order of belts in TJF are: White (Novice or 8th Kyu), Yellow (7th Kyu), Orange (6th Kyu), Green (5th Kyu), Purple (4th Kyu), Light Blue (3rd Kyu), Dark Blue (2nd Kyu), Brown (1st Kyu), followed by the Dan grades, (see below).
Low grades learn the very basic principles of the TJF system. Movement and posture are important early on, as the basic foundation with which to build more advanced techniques later. The jitsuka is taught to defend and disarm against weapon attacks, where appropriate. Intermediate grades develop the lessons learned earlier and add variations to those techniques. The more senior students are encouraged to assist in instruction: to attain 4th Kyu or above there are teaching requirements in addition to the technical requirements. From 1st Kyu and above, jitsuka who are teaching as full Club Instructors ('Acting Primary or Primary Trainer') wear Hakama to denote their instructor rank.
Note that this differs from the grading system used by many other martial arts in the UK: TJF uses two blue grades, dark blue and light blue (2nd and 3rd kyu, respectively) which are more senior than purple (4th kyu) whereas other styles often have a single blue grade (3rd kyu) junior to purple (2nd kyu).
Note: Juniors (17 & Under) have a contrasting belt, with a white stripe running the length of the belt. Junior Novices have a white belt with a red mon at each end. Juniors are not allowed to be taught the Atemi Kata at Novice level.
Dan grades.
There are three Dan grades, usually signified by a black belt. These are further subdivided, with the divisions marking an extra teaching qualification, over and above that of Club Instructor. Promotion within the individual Dan grades also requires further involvement in the administrative running of the association, at either a regional or national level. The "base" Dan grades are awarded on a technical skills-based grading, whereas promotion within a Dan grade is decided by assessment.
Junior Dans (17 and under) have the white stripe on all belts and can be awarded their hakama on completion of passing a "hakama course" which is held at the Junior Nationals. All junior Dan students must have attended their Assistant Instructor, Instructor, Club Instructor, First Aid, and Town club courses held at junior events and there is also a minimum two-year gap from junior brown belt to junior black belt. Most junior dans are around 14–18 years of age and have been practising Jitsu for more than 6 or 7 years. Junior Dans are not insured to teach their own club; an adult Acting Primary or above must be present at all sessions. Juniors Dans must retake their 1st Kyu grading after their 18th birthday and then fulfill the two-year wait, including 1 year teaching, requirements before they are eligible for Shodan again.
Uniform and customs.
Jitsuka wear a white keikogi, usually referred to simply as a gi, which can either be a standard judogi or something slightly lighter. Very light gis such as those used in karate are not worn as they are susceptible to damage during groundwork or when using certain throws. A coloured belt is worn according to grade, as described above. Kyu grades wear a square badge with a white background, black surround, and the word 'Jitsu' in black, on the upper right arm. Dan grades wear different colour badges as described in the Dan grades section above.
It is customary to rei (bow) towards the middle of the dojo (training hall) as one enters or leaves it. When stepping on or off the training mat the jitsuka "rei" to the highest grade currently on the mat or the middle of the mat if it is empty. Also at the beginning and end of the session students line up facing the sensei (teachers). The sensei calls out "kiba dachi" (horse riding stance), "su dachi" (standing with feet together), and "suwaru" (kneeling position). The highest non-teacher grade calls out "sensei ni rei", whereupon students bow. 
The use of "sensei ni rei" is used as the highest grade currently attainable within The Jitsu Foundation is Tertiary Fellow. Since a Third Dan Tertiary Fellow is still referred to as "Sensei", "sensei ni rei" is used. However, when Shihan Brian Graham was present on the mat, the call of "shihan ni rei" would have been used in respect of his sixth Dan grade and title of Shihan.
The highest-ranked teacher then calls "otagai ni rei" and the teachers bow. Before and after training with each other during the session individual pairs of jitsuka also bow to each other. It should be noted that this bowing is not a bow of submission, obeisance, or homage. Rather it is one of mutual respect, forgiveness for any discomfort caused and thanks for the learning experience (Instructors learn too).
National events.
Atemi nationals.
This is an annual two-day event in Sheffield, UK but has previously been held in Birmingham, Telford, Slough and Manchester. Usually taking place in November, courses in the morning and competitions in the afternoon are held for each grade level. There are two phases to the competition. Firstly in the 'V', competitors must defend themselves, using any techniques that they have learned, against a continuous cycle of attackers either unarmed, or armed with weaponry appropriate to the grade of the defender. This is followed by a 'gauntlet'. In this phase, the competitor has a chance to perform techniques without the pressure of a realistic 'combat' situation, however the competitor is expected to demonstrate control, skill, and fluidity. The 'V' focuses on the "martial" or fighting aspect of jujutsu, whereas the 'gauntlet' examines the "art" aspect. The competition uses a points-based system judged by a panel who assess technical ability, style and effectiveness of techniques. The event is held over two days, with heats on day one and finals on day two. Day two also includes the 'open grade' category, which any senior grade can enter. 
Gold, Silver and Bronze medals are awarded to the top three competitors in each of the categories, while the top three competitors in the open are typically awarded trophies. In addition, each club is awarded points for the medals achieved by its members, and a prestigious club shield trophy is presented to the club that tallies the most points. The Atemi nationals club shield was most recently won jointly by Swansea University Jitsu Club and Bristol Jitsu Club in November 2011.
The Jitsu Foundation Juniors hold the same type of event at the National Judo Centre, Birmingham.
Randori nationals.
TJF also run annual Judo competitions for its members, currently held in Telford, UK. Usually taking place in March, courses and competitions are held for each grade level, with those who also hold Judo grades competing at a higher level. At the Randori nationals, grades have a choice of two competitions. In ground fighting (newaza), competitors must try to achieve a pin or submission, whilst on the ground, over a 2 minute bout. In standing fighting (nagewaza), the first to score a full point (Ippon), with any throwing technique, is the winner. Due to the nature of these contests, the competitors are placed in weight, sex and grade categories. The second day hosts the finals and open competition, which is itself a full 'judo rules' competition that allows both standing and ground fighting in the same contest. In the open competition, it is very difficult to score an Ippon, compared to real Judo, and most fights end on the ground.
As in the Atemi nationals, medals are awarded to the top three competitors in each of the categories and each club is awarded points for the medals achieved by its members. A prestigious club shield trophy is presented to the club that tallies the most points. The Randori nationals club shield was most recently won by University College London Jitsu club in February 2012.
The Jitsu Foundation Juniors hold the same type of event at the National Judo Centre, Birmingham.
These two events form the highlights of TJF year for most jitsuka. Both competition events have now been recognized by BUCS, and competitors can earn points for their respective universities, if applicable.
Summer Ball.
Held in July, after the end of the academic year, the Summer Ball is the final event of the Jitsu calendar. It is held in different locations, depending on circumstances:
Although a smaller affair than the two National competitions, it is nonetheless important, as it also hosts the Shodan, Nidan and Sandan (1st-3rd Dan) gradings. The evening dinner has an awards ceremony to congratulate the successful candidates and other individuals who have made significant contributions to the style over the last year. From 2007, there is also a Shodan grading in January.
International events.
International courses take place every three years in a different country outside of the UK, providing an opportunity for jitsuka in clubs around the world to gather and train together. This provides overseas Jitsu organisations the opportunity to host large numbers of jitsuka for a series of seminars taught by leading local and international instructors. The first international course was held in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada in 2003, followed by Amsterdam in 2006, Spartanburg, South Carolina in 2009 and Edinburgh, Scotland in 2013.

Menna Gallie

Menna Patricia Humphreys Gallie (1919 - 1990) was a Welsh novelist and translator. 
She was born in Ystradgynlais, and attended Swansea University, where she met the philosopher W. B. Gallie. They were married in 1940, and had a son and a daughter. Both were politically active, with a commitment to democratic socialism.
She is best known for her novels in the English language, and as the translator of Caradog Prichard's "Un Nos Ola Leuad", under the title "Full Moon".
One reviewer commented on her "characteristically robust humor." Another said "Menna Gallie, a sort of Welsh Edna O'Brien, writes beady-eyed, bawdy-tongued entertainments calculated to stir recognition in women and discomfiture in men (were they to read it)."
Her first novel "Strike for a Kingdom" is "both an engrossing detective novel and a social panorama of a small Welsh village during the 1926 General Strike". It was reprinted by Honno, the Welsh Women's Press, in 2003, with an introduction by Angela John. It was dramatised by BBC Radio 4 in 2012. by Diana Griffiths 
"Man's Desiring" (1960) was described by a reviewer as a novel with "warm and winning ways" a gentle comedy of contrasts about a Welsh man and an English woman at a Midlands university. 
"The Small Mine" tells the tale of a young collier's death in an industrial accident in the same fictional village created in "Strike for a Kingdom". It was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 2004 by Diana Griffiths 
"Travels with a Duchess" is the journey of a menopausal wife from Cardiff who loses her luggage en route to Yugoslavia and abandons her usual ways in favor of adventure and 'debauchery'.

Alpine Club (UK)

The Alpine Club was founded in London in 1857 and is the world's first mountaineering club. It is UK mountaineering's acknowledged 'senior club'.
History.
On 22 December 1857 a group of British mountaineers met at Ashley's Hotel in London. All were active in the Alps and instrumental in the development of alpine mountaineering during the golden age of alpinism (1854–1865). It was at this meeting that the Alpine Club, under the chairmanship of E. S. Kennedy, was born. John Ball was the first president and Kennedy, the first vice-president, succeeded him as president of the club from 1860 to 1863. It then moved its headquarters to the Metropole Hotel.
One hundred and fifty years later, the Alpine Club continues, and its members remain extremely active in the Alps and the Greater Ranges, as well as in mountain arts, literature and science.
For many years it had the characteristics of a London-based Gentlemen's club, including a certain imprecision in the qualification for membership (said to have been 'A reasonable number of respectable peaks'). 
Until 1974, the club was strictly for men only, but in 1975, within months of membership being opened to women, a merger with the Ladies' Alpine Club was agreed, and the Club thus gained about 150 new members. By the last quarter of the 20th century, the club had evolved into Britain's senior mountaineering club, with a clear qualification for membership, for both men and women, and an 'aspirant' grade for those working towards full membership. However, it still requires prospective members to be proposed and seconded by existing members. 
Though the club organises some UK-based meets, its primary focus has always tended towards mountaineering overseas, and it is associated more with exploratory mountaineering than with purely technical climbing (the early club was once dismissed as doing very little climbing but 'a lot of walking steeply uphill'). These higher technical standards were often to be found in offshoots such as the 'Alpine Climbing Group' (ACG), founded in 1952.
The club has produced a suite of guidebooks which cover some of the more popular Alpine mountaineering regions. It also holds extensive book and photo libraries as well as an archive of historical artifacts which are regularly loaned out to exhibitions. The club's history has recently been documented by George Band in his book "Summit: 150 Years of the Alpine Club", and its artists in "The Artists of the Alpine Club" by Peter Mallalieu. Its members' activities are recounted annually in the club's publication the "Alpine Journal".
As of 2009, the membership subscription costs between £39 and £60 per year, with a £27 rate for younger members. There is no joining fee [http://www.alpine-club.org.uk/join/index.html#rates].
Premises.
The club's first premises were at 8 St Martin's Place, Trafalgar Square, where it rented rooms in 1858. In 1895 the club moved to 23 Savile Row, and in June 1907, the Scottish artist Sholto Johnstone Douglas held an exhibition of his portraits at the Club.
From 1937 to 1990 the club was based at 74, South Audley Street, in Mayfair, London. In 1936–1937 the surveying firm of Pilditch, Chadwick and Company had converted the ground floor of the building into suitable premises for the club. The club's library was at the back of the building, in what was once the picture gallery of Sir William Cuthbert Quilter. In 1990 the club sold its lease of 74, South Audley Street and briefly shared quarters with the Ski Club of Great Britain at 118, Eaton Square.
In 1991 the Alpine Club acquired the freehold of a five-storey Victorian warehouse at 55, Charlotte Road, on the edge of the City of London, and this building remains its current headquarters. The club's lecture room, bunk-house, library, and archives are all housed there.

Ménerbes

Ménerbes is a commune in the Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in southeastern France, a walled village on a hilltop in the Luberon mountains, foothills of the French Alps. 
Rural Vaucluse was described by author Marcel Pagnol in such novels as "Manon des Sources," a hardscrabble peasant life in a declining economy. In the years after 1945 the region offered cheap holiday homes. By 1960 Ménerbes was half depopulated but was the residence of Dora Maar, one of Picasso's models, and the widow of artist Nicolas de Staël, and holiday homes of a London art dealer and a French diplomat, whose visitors to Ménerbes thus included many artistic notables. The region grew lavender, mushrooms, truffles and harsh red wine. Within sight of Ménerbes are the ruins of the Chateau de Lacoste, country residence of the notorious Marquis de Sade.
Ménerbes became known in the English-speaking world since 1990 through the books of British author Peter Mayle, tales of a British expatriate who settled in the village of Ménerbes. One of his books was made into a film "A Good Year" (2006) directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe, which was filmed nearby in the region. Much was actually filmed in the nearby town of Bonnieux. Mayle's best-known book was A Year in Provence, and this put the Luberon region onto the tourist map.
Currently, The Brown Foundation Fellows Program based at Dora Maar's former home in Menerbes provides residencies of one to three months for mid-career professionals in the arts and humanities to concentrate on their fields of expertise.
Siege of Ménerbes.
The city of Ménerbes and its citadel were the site of a major battle between Huguenots and Catholics, called the Siege de Ménerbes, which lasted from 1573 to 1578 during the French Wars of Religion. Following early battles across France, Protestants decided to intentionally antagonize Pope Pius V by establishing a stonghold in Ménerbes, initially with 150 soldiers and followers led by Scipione de Valvoire, Gaspard Pape de Saint-Auban, and a baron from Germany. General mobilization on both sides followed, with Catholic forces led by Henri d'Angoulême for the Pope. Despite the balance of power strongly in favor of Catholics, fighting dragged on, increasing in force as time passed. Surrounded by trenches with opposing soldiers, the citadel suffered more that 900 blows by cannonballs, assaults by 14 tons of lead bullets, and barrages by incendiary weapons leading to destruction of its towers. The Protestants finally agreed to negotiations, surrendering on 9 December 1578 to a "glorious capitulation." The battle, which lasted five years, two months, and eight days, had been costly, draining the coffers of the towns in the Comtat Venaissin and putting a heavy financial burden on papal accounts.
Geography.
The river Calavon forms part of the commune's northern border.

Phytogenics

Phytogenics are a group of natural growth promoters (NGPs) or non-antibiotic growth promoters used as feed additives, derived from herbs, spices or other plants. They are commonly regarded as favorable alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) in livestock production. Essential oils represent a concentrated form of phytogenics, containing mainly the active ingredients of the plants. 
Benefits of phytogenics.
The potential benefits of using phytogenics in livestock nutrition are:
Modes of action.
Effect on feed intake.
Due to their aromatic ingredients, phytogenics add flavor to feed, thereby increasing feed palatability. Particularly in pigs, the attractive taste potentially results in higher feed intakes. High feed intakes are a prerequisite for adequate development of piglets as well as for high reproductive performance in sows.
Effect on gut microflora.
A well-balanced gut microflora is necessary to protect the gut from pathogenic invasion. Phytogenic compounds have shown antimicrobial, antioxidative, antiviral or sedative properties. Thus, inclusion of phytogenics results in a decimation of the gut microflora. At the best, a beneficial combination of different phytogenic compounds reduces the number of pathogenic bacteria only, while positive gut bacteria such as "Lactobacilli" or "Bifidobacteria" are not affected.
Effect on secretion of saliva and digestive enzymes.
Phytogenics are known to increase the secretion of saliva and gastric acid, thus having a positive impact on overall digestive processes. Especially in young piglets, the gastric acid production is inadequate, often causing diarrhea in the post-weaning period. Therefore, inclusion of phytogenics, which increases the rate of gastric acid secretion is beneficial in terms of counteracting digestive disorders in this critical stage of life.
Effect on growth rates.
Phytogenic compounds have been recently proven to improve the growth rate of certain animals.
Production of Phytogenics.
Phytogenics have been produced on a commercial scale since the 1980s. Global producers include Biomin, Delacon Biotechnik,[], Nor-Feed Sud, Par Pharmaceutical, and Phytosynthèse.

Natural history of Australia

The natural history of Australia has been shaped by the geological evolution of the Australian continent from Gondwana and the changes in global climate over geological time. The building of the Australian continent and its association with other land masses, as well as climate changes over geological time have created the unique flora and fauna present in Australia today.
Precambrian.
Three areas of the Australian landmass that are made of Archaean rocks are more than 2.5 billion years old, among the oldest rocks known to man. These igneous and metamorphic rocks are found in the Yilgarn (West) and Pilbara (North) cratons in today's Western Australia and the Gawler (South) craton which makes up the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. During the Proterozoic, 2,500 to 545 Ma, continent building took place around the existing cratons; the accretions include sedimentary deposition of the banded iron formations and the formation of Australia's major orebodies - sources of gold, copper, lead, zinc, silver and uranium. These disparate landmasses are thought to have become associated by the tectonic collisions that formed the supercontinent Rodinia, between 1300 to 1100 Ma. Geological evidence suggests that the West Australian cratons collided first, followed by collision with the South Australian craton between ~830 and 750 Ma. The Centralian Superbasin formed the junction of the North, South and West cratons. 
Rodinia broke up between 830 to 745 Ma; at around 750 Ma the western side of Rodinia called Laurentia broke away from the landmass made from Australia, India and Antarctica, forming a gap that would become the Pacific Ocean. 
The Archean rocks from the Pilbara craton contain some of the first evidence of life, primitive cyanobacterial mats known as stromatolites. Soft-bodied organisms from the Ediacaran collectively known as the Ediacaran biota are found in sandstone around the Flinders Ranges in South Australia, notably at a site known as Wilpena Pound.
Gondwana.
Following the breakup of Rodinia; Australia, India and Antarctica made up a large landmass. During plate movements from 750 to 500 Ma South America and Africa moved toward India and Australia and by 500 Ma South America and Africa had joined with them to form Gondwana.
During the Palaeozoic, 545 to 251 Ma, the present landmass of Australia saw two stages of geological development. From 545 to 390 Ma shallow warm seas covered parts of central Australia, with a series of volcanic arcs and deep water sedimentation in the east. During this period between 480 to 460 Ma the Larapinta Seaway extended across the centre of Australia. Cycles of sedimentation and volcanism formed new continental crust, forming eastern Australia. There was a major orogeny in eastern Australia from 387 to 360 Ma. The continent was affected by glaciation around 330 Ma. 
The continents that had drifted apart from Rodinia drifted together again during the Paleozoic: Gondwana, Euramerica, and Siberia/Angara collided to form the supercontinent of Pangea during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, some 350 million years ago. Pangea was a short-lived supercontinent; it began to break apart again in the early Jurassic. While Pangea existed it created opportunities for intermixing of the flora and fauna.
During the Carboniferous glaciation, erosion by ice extended into the Early Permian. Crustal extension and subsidence around 295 Ma formed shallow basins in which thick coal deposits were formed. 
During the Mesozoic, when the Earth became much warmer, 251 to 140 Ma, the Australian landmass was covered with riverine plains. Humid conditions allowed the formation of peatlands, particularly in the east. Dinosaurs, reptiles and primitive mammals were present in Australia. Between 140 and 99 Ma sea levels rose and much of the continent was covered. In the same period (between 120 - 105 Ma) there was more volcanism in eastern Australia, leading to uplift creating the Tasman Sea to the southeast and the Coral Sea to the north.
The earliest land plants preserved in Australia occur in desposits from the Upper Silurian and the Lower Devonian in marine sediments in Victoria, named the Baragwanathia Assemblage for its most prominent element, the simple vascular plant the lycopod "Baragwanathia". The assemblage also included Rhyniophyta, Zosterophyllophyta, Trimerophyta in addition to other lycopods. All these plants were herbaceous, coastal and required an aqueous environment for reproduction. During the Devonian the first shrub-sized to tree-sized lycopods appeared in Australia and Antarctica; they dominated the flora until the Early Carboniferous. In the mid- to Late Carboniferous, as Australia drifted from equatorial latitudes to polar latitudes, the lycopods waned and were replaced by seed-ferns, and the "Nothorhacopteris"-"Fedekurtzia"-"Botrychiopis" complex. 
Most of the modern Australian fauna had its origin in the Cretaceous. From pollen records from the Late Cretaceous it is proposed that the flora of the Cretaceous either evolved within the Austro-Antarctic region or entered Australia from Antarctica. Angiosperms evolved in the northern Gondwana/southern Laurasia during the Early Creteaceous and radiated worldwide, prominent members of this early angiosperm flora were the "Nothofagus". 
Fossils found at Lightning Ridge, New South Wales suggest that 110 million years ago Australia supported a number of different monotremes, but did not support any marsupials. Marsupials appear to have evolved during the Cretaceous in the contemporary northern hemisphere, to judge from a 100 million-year-old marsupial fossil, "Kokopellia", found in the badlands of Utah. Marsupials would have then have spread to South America and Gondwana. The first evidence of marsupials in Australia comes from the Tertiary, and was found at a 55 million-year-old fossil site at Murgon, near Kingaroy in southern Queensland. The Murgon fossil site has yielded a range of marsupial fossils, many with strong South American connections — unsurprising since the two continents were both a part of Gondwana. At Murgon evidence of a placental mammal, a Condylarth ("Tingamarra porterorum)", was discovered. Placental mammals were also found in North America and South America at this time. This find suggests that placental mammals did coexist with marsupials lived in Australia in the early Tertiary, although only marsupials persisted.
Isolation.
Australia separated from Gondwana 99 Ma, and initially remained warm and humid with rainforest vegetation. Inland Australia had systems of rivers and lakes with abundant wildlife. Fossil birds, platypus, frogs and snakes are present from this period. From 30 Ma there was a period of global cooling and from 15 Ma the Antarctic ice sheet formed. Sand deserts and large inland salt lakes formed within the last 5 Ma. Climatic oscillation during the Pleistocene during the last million years led to repeated phases of glaciation with lower sea levels that linked Australia to New Guinea and warmer interglacial periods with higher sea levels.
As early as the Miocene (23 to 5.3 Ma) and into the Pleistocene (20,000-50,000 years before present) the Australian megafauna developed. The megafauna became extinct in the late Pleistocene, at a time coinciding with both a period of climate change and the first human habitation of Australia. Recent analysis suggests that the fire-stick farming methods of the Australian Aborigines reduced plant diversity and contributed to the extinction of large herbivores with a specialised diet, like the flightless birds from the genus "Genyornis". The World Heritage listed Naracoorte Caves in South Australia are the best record of the Australian megafauna. The placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the Pleistocene, as Australia continued to move closer to Indonesia, both bats and rodents appearing reliably in the fossil record. The geographic isolation of Australia created a sharp division between Australian fauna and Asian fauna at the Wallace line.

Vector notation

Vector notation, this page gives an overview of the commonly used mathematical notation when working with mathematical vectors, which may be geometric vectors or abstract members of vector spaces.
For representing a vector, the common typographic convention is upright boldface type, as in formula_1 for a vector named ‘v’. In handwriting, where boldface type is either unavailable or unwieldy, vectors are often represented with right-pointing arrow notation or harpoons above their names, as in formula_2. Shorthand notations include tildes and straight lines placed above or below the name of a vector.
Between 1880 and 1887, Oliver Heaviside developed the operational calculus, a method of solving differential equations by transforming them into ordinary algebraic equations which caused much controversy when introduced because of the lack of rigour in its derivation. After the turn of the 20th century, Josiah Willard Gibbs would in physical chemistry supply notation for the scalar product and vector products, which was introduced in "Vector Analysis".
Rectangular vectors.
A rectangular vector is a coordinate vector specified by components that define a rectangle (or rectangular prism in three dimensions, and similar shapes in greater dimensions). The starting point and terminal point of the vector lie at opposite ends of the rectangle (or prism, etc.).
Ordered set notation.
A rectangular vector in formula_3 can be specified using an ordered set of components, enclosed in either parentheses or angle brackets.
In a general sense, an "n"-dimensional vector v can be specified in either of the following forms:
Where "v"1, "v"2, …, "v""n" − 1, "v""n" are the components of v.
Matrix notation.
A rectangular vector in formula_3 can also be specified as a row or column matrix containing the ordered set of components. A vector specified as a row matrix is known as a row vector; one specified as a column matrix is known as a column vector.
Again, an "n"-dimensional vector formula_1 can be specified in either of the following forms using matrices:
Where "v"1, "v"2, …, "v""n" − 1, "v""n" are the components of v. In some advanced contexts, a row and a column vector have different meaning; see covariance and contravariance of vectors.
Unit vector notation.
A rectangular vector in formula_10 (or fewer dimensions, such as formula_11 where "v""z" below is zero) can be specified as the sum of the scalar multiples of the components of the vector with the members of the standard basis in formula_10. The basis is represented with the unit vectors formula_13, formula_14, and formula_15.
A three-dimensional vector v can be specified in the following form, using unit vector notation:
Where "v""x", "v""y", and "v""z" are the magnitudes of the components of v.
Polar vectors.
A polar vector is a vector in two dimensions specified as a magnitude (or length) and a direction (or angle). It is akin to an arrow in the polar coordinate system. The magnitude, typically represented as "r", is the length from the starting point of the vector to its endpoint. The angle, typically represented as "θ" (the Greek letter theta), is measured as the offset from the horizontal (or a line collinear with the "x"-axis in the positive direction). The angle is typically reduced to lie within the range formula_17 radians or formula_18.
Ordered set and matrix notations.
Polar vectors can be specified using either ordered pair notation (a subset of ordered set notation using only two components) or matrix notation, as with rectangular vectors. In these forms, the first component of the vector is "r" (instead of "v"1) and the second component is "θ" (instead of "v"2). To differentiate polar vectors from rectangular vectors, the angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol, formula_19.
A two-dimensional polar vector "v" can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered pair or matrix notation:
Where "r" is the magnitude, "θ" is the angle, and the angle symbol (formula_19) is optional.
Direct notation.
Polar vectors can also be specified using simplified autonomous equations that define "r" and "θ" explicitly. This can be unwieldy, but is useful for avoiding the confusion with two-dimensional rectangular vectors that arises from using ordered pair or matrix notation.
A two-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units and whose direction is "π"/9 radians (20°) can be specified using either of the following forms:
Cylindrical vectors.
A cylindrical vector is an extension of the concept of polar vectors into three dimensions. It is akin to an arrow in the cylindrical coordinate system. A cylindrical vector is specified by a distance in the "xy"-plane, an angle, and a distance from the "xy"-plane (a height). The first distance, usually represented as "r" or "ρ" (the Greek letter rho), is the magnitude of the projection of the vector onto the "xy"-plane. The angle, usually represented as "θ" or "φ" (the Greek letter phi), is measured as the offset from the line collinear with the "x"-axis in the positive direction; the angle is typically reduced to lie within the range formula_17. The second distance, usually represented as "h" or "z", is the distance from the "xy"-plane to the endpoint of the vector.
Ordered set and matrix notations.
Cylindrical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the second distance component is concatenated as a third component to form ordered triplets (again, a subset of ordered set notation) and matrices. The angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol (formula_19); the distance-angle-distance combination distinguishes cylindrical vectors in this notation from spherical vectors in similar notation.
A three-dimensional cylindrical vector "v" can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:
Where "r" is the magnitude of the projection of v onto the "xy"-plane, "θ" is the angle between the positive "x"-axis and v, and "h" is the height from the "xy"-plane to the endpoint of "v". Again, the angle symbol (formula_19) is optional.
Direct notation.
A cylindrical vector can also be specified directly, using simplified autonomous equations that define "r" (or "ρ"), "θ" (or "φ"), and "h" (or "z"). Consistency should be used when choosing the names to use for the variables; "ρ" should not be mixed with "θ" and so on.
A three-dimensional vector, the magnitude of whose projection onto the "xy"-plane is 5 units, whose angle from the positive "x"-axis is "π"/9 radians (20°), and whose height from the "xy"-plane is 3 units can be specified in any of the following forms:
Spherical vectors.
A spherical vector is another method for extending the concept of polar vectors into three dimensions. It is akin to an arrow in the spherical coordinate system. A spherical vector is specified by a magnitude, an azimuth angle, and a zenith angle. The magnitude is usually represented as "ρ". The azimuth angle, usually represented as "θ", is the offset from the line collinear with the "x"-axis in the positive direction. The zenith angle, usually represented as "φ", is the offset from the line collinear with the "z"-axis in the positive direction. Both angles are typically reduced to lie within the range from zero (inclusive) to 2"π" (exclusive).
Ordered set and matrix notations.
Spherical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the zenith angle is concatenated as a third component to form ordered triplets and matrices. The azimuth and zenith angles may be both prefixed with the angle symbol (formula_19); the prefix should be used consistently to produce the distance-angle-angle combination that distinguishes spherical vectors from cylindrical ones.
A three-dimensional spherical vector "v" can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:
Where "ρ" is the magnitude, "θ" is the azimuth angle, and "φ" is the zenith angle.
Direct notation.
Like polar and cylindrical vectors, spherical vectors can be specified using simplified autonomous equations, in this case for "ρ", "θ", and "φ".
A three-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units, whose azimuth angle is "π"/9 radians (20°), and whose zenith angle is "π"/4 radians (45°) can be specified as:
Operations.
In any given vector space, the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined. Normed vector spaces also define an operation known as the norm (or determination of magnitude). Inner product spaces also define an operation known as the inner product. In formula_3, the inner product is known as the dot product. In formula_10 and formula_47, an additional operation known as the cross product is also defined.
Vector addition.
Vector addition is represented with the plus sign used as an operator between two vectors. The sum of two vectors u and v would be represented as:
Scalar multiplication.
Scalar multiplication is represented in the same manners as algebraic multiplication. A scalar beside a vector (either or both of which may be in parentheses) implies scalar multiplication. The two common operators, a dot and a rotated cross, are also acceptable (although the rotated cross is almost never used), but they risk confusion with dot products and cross products, which operate on two vectors. The product of a scalar "c" with a vector v can be represented in any of the following fashions:
Vector subtraction and scalar division.
Using the algebraic properties of subtraction and division, along with scalar multiplication, it is also possible to “subtract” two vectors and “divide” a vector by a scalar.
Vector subtraction is performed by adding the scalar multiple of −1 with the second vector operand to the first vector operand. This can be represented by the use of the minus sign as an operator. The difference between two vectors u and v can be represented in either of the following fashions:
Scalar division is performed by multiplying the vector operand with the numeric inverse of the scalar operand. This can be represented by the use of the fraction bar or division signs as operators. The quotient of a vector v and a scalar "c" can be represented in any of the following forms:
Norm.
The norm of a vector is represented with double bars on both sides of the vector. The norm of a vector v can be represented as:
The norm is also sometimes represented with single bars, like formula_58, but this can be confused with absolute value (which is a type of norm).
Inner product.
The inner product (also known as the scalar product, not to be confused with scalar multiplication) of two vectors is represented as an ordered pair enclosed in angle brackets. The inner product of two vectors u and v would be represented as:
Dot product.
In formula_3, the inner product is also known as the dot product. In addition to the standard inner product notation, the dot product notation (using the dot as an operator) can also be used (and is more common). The dot product of two vectors u and v can be represented as:
In some older literature, the dot product is implied between two vectors written side-by-side. This notation can be confused with the dyadic product between two vectors.
Cross product.
The cross product of two vectors (in formula_10) is represented using the rotated cross as an operator. The cross product of two vectors u and v would be represented as:
In some older literature, the following notation is used for the cross product between u and v:

Littlehaven railway station

Littlehaven Railway Station serves the areas of Littlehaven, Holbrook and Roffey in the northeast of the town of Horsham, West Sussex, England. It is on the Arun Valley Line, and is the first station out of Horsham on that route going towards London.
History.
The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway opened the first part of the line in 1848. However, the stations at Littlehaven, Roffey Road Halt and nearby Ifield were not opened until 1907; Littlehaven opened as Rusper Road Halt and subsequently changed to Littlehaven Crossing Halt and then Littlehaven Halt all within the first year of service. Similarly, Ifield was initially known as "Lyons Crossing Halt". Roffey Road Halt closed in 1937.
The station was completely rebuilt with minimal facilities after traffic decreased.
In 2013, work began to extend the platforms to handle 8 carriages (up from 4), which will reduce delays caused by longer trains blocking the road while stopped.
Level crossing.
There is a level crossing at the eastern (London) end of the platforms, where the line crosses Rusper Road. The crossing gates were considered for replacement with modern barriers in the early 1990s but as there was a history of late passengers running over the crossing to catch their train it was dismissed. Therefore the adjacent signal box was manned 24 hours a day. In October 2012 the level crossing was rebuilt and automatic barriers installed to replace the old fashioned gates. This meant that the crossing operator's job was now redundant, with CCTV used to control the crossing from the Three Bridges signal centre. This upgrade was finally made necessary due to a number of incidents of people driving through the wooden gates when closed, resulting in expensive replacement gates having to be constructed.
Services.
The station is operated and served by Southern services. The typical off-peak service pattern is:
Facilities include disabled access to both platforms via side ramps from the level crossing, and a ticket office on the Horsham-bound platform. Its opening hours are 0640-1334 Monday-Saturday only.

Bunker gear

[[Image:Turnout gear in the Czech Republic.jpg|right|thumb|Turnout gear or "bunker gear" used by firefighters in the Czech Republic:<br>
Common turnout coat and turnout pants (dark with reflective safety stripes on the left)<br>

Bunker gear or turnout gear are terms used by many firefighters to refer to their system of outer protective clothing. "Bunker gear" and "turnout gear" can refer, depending on the context, to just the trousers, boots and jacket, or to the entire combination of personal protective equipment and personal protective clothing. The terms are derived from the fact that the trousers and boots are traditionally kept by the firefighter's bunk at the fire station to be readily available for use. This clothing is usually referred to as "fire kit" in the UK and Ireland. In Hong Kong, it is referred to as "incident gear".
History.
Historically, firefighters did not have the same level of protective clothing used today. Because of this most fires were fought from the outside of burning buildings, and structures were rarely entered. Early in the history of firefighting, a firefighter's outer clothing were more for warmth and dryness than for protection from fire. In the early 19th century, felt caps were worn of various design and were more for decoration than service, this early headgear did not provide any protection against flame or head injury but did keep water off the firefighter's face. The forerunner of the modern firefighter's helmet was developed in 1830 by a luggage maker Henry Gratacap who was a volunteer firefighter in New York City. He saw a need for a better designed helmet that was both functional and provided protection to the wearer. This helmet is immediately recognizable today as the "New Yorker" style and little has changed in its general shape. The helmet had a high peaked front to retain a helmet shield which was usually adorned with a company name and number and it also featured eight rib sections on the dome (for added rigidity) and a long rear brim that channeled water away from the wearer's neck.
The early use of long trench coats, made of leather or canvas and later made of rubber, was the forerunner of modern turnout jackets. Early coats had felt or wool liners to provide warmth in the winter. These liners later developed in basic thermal protection liners found in today's modern coats. Earlier rubber coats were much longer than today's modern turnout jackets, reaching down to a firefighter's mid thigh and were worn with long rubber boots called "three-quarter boots" which came above the firefighter's knees. This interface of boot and coat left a large gap of protection against fire. This system has since been replaced by the modern combination of a jacket, pants with suspenders, and shorter rubber or leather boots, although some departments still wear the traditional old style of gear.
The combination of modern triple-layer turnout gear with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), PASS device, and modern communications equipment made it more feasible and survivable to enter burning buildings. Modern turnout jackets and pants are made of fire resistant fabrics (mainly Aramids such as Nomex and Kevlar) or polybenzimidazole (PBI) fibers. The standard that the National Fire Protection Association has designated to firefighter protective clothing, NFPA 1971: Standard on Protective Ensembles for Structural Fire Fighting and Proximity Fire Fighting, which specifies "the minimum design, performance, safety, testing, and certification requirements for structural fire fighting protective ensembles and ensemble elements that include coats, trousers, coveralls, helmets, gloves, footwear, and interface components.
Station uniform.
The first component of firefighting equipment is the uniform that a firefighter will wear around the station. Its purpose is to provide a comfortable clothing that they wear around the station, but will not become an obstruction when a firefighter is required to put on his turnout gear. Naturally, turnout gear is to be worn over the station garments during any call that a firefighter is called upon. Another aspect of the station uniform is the station safety shoes, commonly referred to as work boots. These shoes are required to be fitted with safety toes and puncture-resistant soles in most countries in case the firefighter goes out on a call that does not require his/her turnout gear.
United States.
The United States follows NFPA 1975, Standard on Station/Work Uniforms for Fire Fighters. NFPA 1975s main purpose is that no part of the uniform garment “ignite, melt, drip, or separate” when exposed to a heat of 500°F for 5 minutes.
Turnout clothing.
Turnout clothing can consist of a combination of trousers with an overall strap attached, boots, and a jacket. Most fire services seem to use a trouser/jacket combination. The advantage of this combination is the ability to take off the jacket in situations where the jacket is not necessary. Since bunker gear insulates the body from the outside air, the body heats up rapidly: taking off a jacket helps considerably in keeping cool.
It has been noted that young children who happen to be in already dangerous circumstances like a building fire may be frightened by the appearance of firefighters so equipped. To deal with that potential problem, many fire departments have school presentations to familiarize children with the gear so as to ensure they will be calm and cooperative during emergencies 
Materials.
According to NFPA 1971 and similar standards in other countries, all turnout clothing must have three components: an outer shell, a moisture barrier, and a thermal barrier. In between these layers are pockets of air referred to as "dead zones". These layers of air, along with the three protective layers, help to further insulate the wearer from the extreme environments of fires. Usually turnout pants are outfitted with reinforced knees and leather cuffs.
The materials used for the three layers in turnout trousers and coats may vary but will very often include a Nomex/Kevlar combination of material. As an example, the materials used by the Los Angeles City Fire Department, as found in their 2005 recruit handout are as follows:
NFPA 1500(Primary Guidelines for the Fire Service) and similar standards mandate features such as protective collars and sleeves to protect the fire fighter from exposure to heat, (hot or polluted) water and debris;
Turnout trousers.
Once the need arises for actual firefighting protective equipment to be worn, also known as turnouts, a firefighter must properly wear protective equipment required. Turnout trousers will be the first article of clothing that a firefighter will usually wear. Suspenders worn with the turnout trousers should be the heavy duty type in order to stand up against such heavy weights and rigorous activities they will face. Most experienced interior firefighters (firefighters that enter the structure in an emergency) will carry, in their turnout trouser pockets, various tools and equipment as well as rope they may need during an emergency. The turnout trousers, when not in use, are usually stored scrunched down around the boots for efficient and fast access when they are needed. The firefighter may then step into each boot and pull up the trousers and suspenders.
Turnout coat.
A turnout coat is the type of jacket typically worn by firefighters. Oversized pockets allow for carrying tools and equipment, and reflective safety stripes ensure that firefighters remain visible to each other. Protective coats will usually have Velcro or zipper functions which will enable a firefighter to properly and efficiently don this piece of gear. There is also a storm flap which covers this closure area and protects it against damage and loosening and as an extra measure to the fire fighter as these areas can be exposed to fire and heat. Wristlets, 4 inch (according to NFPA 1500) 100% Nomex coverings along the distal end of the coat arms in with the thumb joint will slip through, fit around the firefighter's hand and provide redundant protection where the skin may show between the glove and coat. They are designed to prevent burns to the wrist, while preventing bunching and remaining flexible.
Overall.
The overalls that are available are of the same materials and specifications. Usually an overall has a cord built in around the waist to make it fit better. Because of its size it's more difficult to scrunch up the overall around the boots.
Boots.
Firefighter turnout boots are usually sized as a regular shoe, but are made of rubber or leather with a Boron Steel toe insert. The boots are slipped inside the legs of the trousers to maintain a barrier from the heat given off by the fire. When the trousers and boots are not being actively used, the trousers will fold down and out around the shins of the boots, ready for quick access for the firefighter. Due to the enormous amounts of potential hazards at a fire scene to the feet, turnout boots are required to be able to handle a variety of different burns and blows. All boots are required to be outfitted with safety toes and a puncture resistant midsole plate to prevent puncture from sharp objects that may be stepped on. Such emphasis on the midsole plate is made that IFSTA has deemed that “if there is doubt about midsole protection, should go as far as to x-ray the boot.”
Flash hood/Nomex hood and other parts of the garments.
When helmets do not provide built-in protection for the ears, neck and part of the face a protective firefighting hood is worn by firefighters. These are fitted and designed to protect the firefighter’s ears, neck, and the parts of his face which are not protected by the SCBA mask.
They are designed to the guidelines set by NFPA 1975. Cal/OSHA Title #8 also has regulations in the state of California. They are made of Nomex Knit Fabric which weighs 6 oz./ Sq. Yrd.; they are most often double ply with only one seam running from the top center of the face opening, over the top and down the bottom of the bib. The Nomex Knit, which is standard, is why they are commonly referred to as Nomex hoods. First, the hood is tucked into the collar. The SCBA mask is then donned, and the hood pulled over the face seal to cover any exposed skin.
Firefighter helmet.
The design of helmets vary from fire service to fire service and depends on the service or department's requirements. Some helmets are fitted with a face guard or shield to protect the firefighter's face against heat, dust, water and debris when working on a rescue or extraction call as well as when performing fire exposure protection. In the case of exposure protection the shield works better for it keeps more heat from the firefighter's face, but the goggles give more eye protection in extraction and rescue ops.
United States.
There are four basic components to firefighting helmets:
Colors.
Some departments, such as the Los Angeles City Fire Department (LAFD) use the helmet color to identify officers and functions and is listed as follows per [http://www.lafd.org].
The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) issues a black helmet to all ranks except those of Battalion Chief and up. These officers receive a white helmet. The FDNY uses the front shield of the helmet to distinguish both company number and the function of that company. The following colors denote function in the FDNY:
The Houston Fire Department (HFD) uses a combination of colored helmets and colored leather shields and colored coat striping to distinguish rank and function.
The National Park Services Statue of Liberty Fire Brigade (NPS) uses black helmets with custom leather front shield with a red, white and blue firefighter ID number on the rear of the helmet. Park Emergency Medical Technicians are issued yellow fire helmets. The Statue Of Liberty Fire Brigade consists of Structural Firefighters and Wildland firefighters that respond to fires on Liberty and Ellis Island although the wildland firefighters may be deployed to large fires in other parks.
Certain styles of helmets do not lend themselves to the use of leather helmet fronts. Typically these helmets use crescents on the side to distinguish function. These crescents come in a wide variety of titles and are usually reflective in nature.
In most cases here in the United States the colors will be as follows
Fire chief, Assistant chief, Deputy Chief, Battalion chief : white
Captain and LTs: red or yellow and vice versa.
Engineers: red or black
Firefighters: black in most cases, yellow at some departments
Probationary: Orange, yellow
Safety officer: Blue
explorers and Jrs: Green and Yellow
Europe.
In Europe and some Europe-oriented countries around the world the helmet designs vary from the U.S. designs in that they are moving towards a style without brims. The pilot-style helmets have a brim at the front of the helmet, and a shape that covers more of the head. The neck is protected by a combination of a Nomex (or similar material) flash hood, and a foil-faced neck curtain which connects to the rear of the helmet. In most designs the Nomex fabric also protects the area around a SCBA facepiece and the front of the neck. A commonly used helmet is the F1 helmet although several other designs like the Dräger HPS Helmet are in use.
These helmets tend to have in-built face protection (visors) and eye protection that swivel into the shell of the helmet for protection.
EN 443:1997 (Helmets for firefighters) specifies the properties that are demanded for protection, comfort and durability. There are optional specifications to cater for national requirements. The new EN 443-2008 now replace the EN 443-1997.
Hand protection.
There are many types of hand protection which are available to firefighters today, the most common being the work glove and the structural firefighting glove.
Work gloves are a must for all fire services. They are used when gloves are required, but actual firefighting gloves are not. They allow better mobility to perform various types of functions from relaying hose beds to vehicle maintenance. Work gloves are usually made of leather or a leather-like material.
Extrication gloves are similar in design and appearance to auto mechanic's gloves but are made of a heavier rip-proof and puncture-resistant material such as Kevlar while still lightweight enough to allow the manual dexterity to operate rescue equipment and sometimes enough to take a victim's pulse. These are used in urban search and rescue, vehicle extrication and related applications, but are not rated for firefighting.
For an actual working fire, structural firefighting gloves must be worn. Structural gloves tend to be the last piece of protective equipment to be donned; usually because the free dexterity of the fingers are required to perform functions such as properly placing an SCBA mask on and accurately tightening a helmet strap. The gloves will fit over the wristlets and under the distal part of the coat sleeve, ensuring full enclosure of the latter arm. Gloves are designed to protect from extreme heat, various penetrating objects, and to allow dexterity. Usually the latter is sacrificed in order to give adequate protection to heat and sharp objects. Newer gloves are more lightweight and don't lose their dexterity when they dry after becoming wet, the way leather gloves may.
Variations.
Proximity suit.
There are several other related types of protective clothing worn by firefighters, which are not usually called turnout gear:
Proximity gear or a fire proximity suit is turnout gear with an outer layer of heat-reflecting metallic material, used in firefighting applications of extreme heat such as aircraft fires and some chemical fires.
Hazmat suit.
Hazmat suits are designed to prevent the wearer from coming into contact with hazardous materials. The suits come in two variations; gastight (called Level A in the US) and splash protection (Levels B or C in the US). These suits are uncomfortable to wear and always require the use of SCBA or an airline breathing apparatus. The suit consists of the body, boots, 2 pairs of rubber or latex gloves, and another pair of latex gloves that is duct taped to the sleeves to provide maximum protection. The next piece is the hood. The hood allows the HAZMAT operator to enter the scene and still have a full range of view with the maximum protection possible. The SCBA (Self Contained Breathing Apparatus) is worn under the suit so it as well is protected from any chemicals that the operator may endure while on the scene.
Wildland fire suppression.
Protective clothing worn for forest fire and other wildland fire suppression use is made of a single layer of lightweight Nomex material and worn with leather logging boots and an industrial hard hat. A tent-like fire shelter is carried for emergency use in case of a blowup. In the U.S. the standard colour scheme for wildland fire PPE since the 1970s is yellow for shirts, green for trousers. Steel toed or rubber boots cannot be worn due to the heat conditions on the fireline. U.S. standards for wildland gear are covered in NFPA 1977.

Craig Breslow

Craig Andrew Breslow (born August 8, 1980) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball. He throws left-handed, and is the primary set-up man of the Red Sox. 
As a senior at Yale University, where he majored in molecular biophysics and biochemistry, he led the Ivy League with a 2.56 ERA. He was drafted in the 26th round by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2002, and debuted in the Major Leagues with the San Diego Padres in 2005.
Through 2013, he held major league batters to a .217 batting average with runners in scoring position (and .204 with two outs and runners in scoring position). While he was long considered a lefty specialist, he has been successful against right-handed hitters as well. Through 2013, lefties hit only .230 against him (while righties hit .222), with a .354 slugging percentage (.331 for righties). He was second in the American League in appearances by a pitcher in both 2009 (77 games) and 2010 (75 games).
Breslow was given the nickname "smartest man in baseball" by "Minneapolis Star Tribune" Twins beat writer La Velle E. Neal III, and "Wall Street Journal" reporter Jason Turbow wrote: "Judging by his résumé, Craig Breslow is the smartest man in baseball, if not the entire world." The "Sporting News" named him the smartest athlete on their top-20 list, in 2010.
Early life.
Breslow is Jewish, and attended Hebrew school. His family attended Congregation B'nai Israel in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he had his bar mitzvah in 1993. He has fasted while pitching on Yom Kippur, and noted: "Being Jewish is more difficult in baseball ... but I try to do what I can in terms of paying attention to holidays." 
Breslow's father Abe Breslow is a teacher and the former department chair in Physical Education and Health, and boys tennis coach and girls soccer coach, at Trumbull High School. His mother, Ann Breslow, is a math teacher in Bridgeport. 
In 1992 when he was 12 years old, his sister Lesley—two years older—was diagnosed with pediatric thyroid cancer, for which she had surgery to remove all of her thyroid gland (a thyroidectomy). "Something as traumatic as that has a lasting impact," Breslow said. "It confirmed my interest medicine. Being a doctor went from being a prestigious profession to something that changes people's lives." The experience led Breslow to take an interest in molecular biophysics and biochemistry. Later in life, Breslow formed a non-profit foundation to help children with cancer. In 2013 his sister was taking the drug synthroid and monitored by doctors, but leading an unrestricted life as a 20-year cancer survivor, and had given birth to two sons.
High school.
Breslow attended Trumbull High School in Trumbull, Connecticut, graduating in 1998. He was a standout in baseball and soccer, and served as team captain in both sports during his senior year. 
In baseball, he was the winning pitcher in the Class LL State Baseball championship game, playing with teammate and future Arizona Diamondbacks 2nd round draft pick, Jamie D'Antona. As a senior in high school, Breslow played in the Connecticut/Massachusetts All-Star game at Fenway Park. He was named to the 1998 "New Haven Register" All-Area team.
In soccer, he helped lead Trumbull High to their first-ever state tournament victory. In 1997, he was named to the Fairfield County Interscholastic Athletic Conference Boys First-Team Soccer Team. He was known for having an uncanny ability to score from very difficult and wide angles, and ranks among the school's all-time scorers. Scholastically he excelled as well, scoring 1420 on his SAT exam.
College.
Breslow was captain of the Yale University baseball team, the Yale Bulldogs in the Ivy League. As a freshman in 1999, he pitched for the Middletown Giants of the New England Collegiate Baseball League; in November 2013 he was inducted into the NECBL’s Hall of Fame. As a junior, he led Yale in victories (3) and ERA (2.61; 3rd in the Ivy League), striking out 66 batters in 51⅔ innings (ranking 13th in the nation in strikeouts per nine innings). He earned All-Ivy honors that season, which included a 16-strikeout performance vs. Cornell, and a one-hit shutout at Harvard. As a senior, he led the Ivy League with a 2.56 ERA. 
In 2002, Breslow was named a "Jewish Sports Review" College Baseball First Team All-American, along with future major leaguers Sam Fuld and Adam Greenberg. He graduated in 2002 with a B.A. in molecular biophysics and biochemistry.
He was drafted in the 26th round by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2002. Breslow deferred acceptance to the New York University School of Medicine because of his "love of the game".
Breslow became the first former Bulldog since pitcher Ron Darling (1983–95) to reach the Major Leagues when he made his debut with San Diego in 2005, and was not followed by another Yale player until catcher Ryan Lavarnway (who also happens to also be Jewish) in 2011. Breslow was also one of six Ivy Leaguers on major league rosters at the beginning of the 2009 season. In 2012, Breslow and Lavarnway became the first Yale grads to be Major League teammates since 1949, and the first All-Yale battery in the major leagues since 1883.
Professional career.
Milwaukee Brewers organization (2002–04).
In 2002, Breslow ranked fifth in the Pioneer League with six wins, going 6–2 with a 1.82 ERA (54⅓ IP) in 23 appearances out of the pen for the Rookie-level Ogden Raptors. He struck out 56 in 54⅓ innings, and limited the opposition to a .218 average.
In 2003, he averaged 11⅓ strikeouts per nine innings for the Single-A Beloit Snappers, fanning 80 batters in 65 innings.
In 2004, Breslow played 79 games in the Brewers system, reaching the Class A California League High Desert Mavericks. The Brewers released Breslow during the 2004 season. 
He then took the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and scored a 34 (the average score for medical school applicants was 28), and applied to NYU Medical School. But though the medical school accepted him, they would only let him start if he agreed to stop playing baseball. "I wasn't ready to give it up," he said. "I thought I could still get guys out." As of 2013, he was undecided as to whether after his baseball career ends he will attend medical school, or alternatively perhaps become involved in the front office side of baseball.
Northeast League (2004).
Breslow completed the 2004 season pitching for the New Jersey Jackals of the Northeast League, an independent baseball league. He held batters to a .204 average and recorded 37 strikeouts in 26⅓ innings, an average of 12.6 strikeouts per nine innings.
San Diego Padres organization (2005).
Signed by the San Diego Padres in 2005 for $1 out of a tryout camp, he excelled, getting $1,500 after making the Double-A Southern League Mobile BayBears, allowing a .212 average in 52 innings over 40 outings while striking out 47 and walking 17 with a 2.75 ERA. He earned his first big league callup on July 23, 2005. He was mistaken for the team batboy during his first day with the Padres. He became the 24th Yalie to play in Major League Baseball and the first to reach the major leagues since Ron Darling. "It wasn't until I was playing baseball in the big leagues that I thought I could play baseball in the big leagues," he said.
Breslow then split the rest of the season between San Diego, for whom he had a 2.20 ERA in 14 games, and the Triple-A Pacific Coast League Portland Beavers. The Padres non-tendered Breslow in December 2005.
Boston Red Sox organization (2006–07).
He was signed by the Red Sox, as a minor league free agent, to a minor league contract in January 2006.
2006.
In 2006, Breslow was named an International League (Triple-A) All-Star while with the Pawtucket Red Sox. In 67 innings of work for the season, he was 7–1 with a 2.69 ERA and struck out an average of 10.3 batters per nine innings. He was selected by his teammates as the PawSox Most Valuable Pitcher. He was promoted to Boston in the second half of the season, making him the fourth Jewish player (in addition to Kevin Youkilis, Gabe Kapler, and Adam Stern) to play for the Red Sox that year.
In 12 innings with the Red Sox in 2006, he posted a 3.75 ERA and had 12 strikeouts. 
Off the field, he helped Red Sox pitcher Josh Beckett win a bet against catcher Doug Mirabelli. Breslow calculated how many times a baseball spins when it's thrown 90 miles an hour from the pitcher's mound to home plate. "Josh wanted to know if I could figure out how many times a baseball spins on the way to the plate," Breslow said. "There's a lot of variables, but I put in some figures and came up with answers for a fastball, curve, or slider. It's rather simple once you do it."
2007.
Breslow earned a trip to the Triple-A All-Star game in July for the second straight season for the Pawtucket Red Sox. At the end of June, Breslow’s ERA was 1.55. But his final numbers for 2007 were 2–3, 4.06 ERA, 25 walks, 73 strikeouts in 68 innings. He was promoted to Boston on September 1, 2007, but did not make an appearance and was sent back to Pawtucket on September 2 to make room on the team roster for Jon Lester. Breslow was added to the postseason roster, and has a ring from winning the 2007 World Series — without pitching a game in the majors that year.
Cleveland Indians (2008).
On March 23, 2008, Breslow was claimed off outright waivers by the Cleveland Indians and was added to the 40-man roster. Breslow was out of minor league options, so the Indians had to keep him on their big league club out of camp, or expose him to waivers again. Breslow won the final spot on the Indians' Opening Day roster. "He's strong," Cleveland manager Eric Wedge said. "I want to be able to use him two innings. He's done that—if you look at his innings pitched the last couple of years versus appearances."
On May 23, after pitching in nine games, Breslow was designated for assignment.
Minnesota Twins (2008–09).
On May 29, 2008, the Minnesota Twins claimed Breslow off waivers. In 42 games for the Twins Breslow had a 1.63 ERA, and gave up only 24 hits in 38⅔ innings. Lefties hit .183 against him, with a .232 slugging percentage, and in save situations batters batted .100 against him, with a .100 slugging percentage. He did not give up a run in his last 14 appearances.
Breslow's aggregate 2008 ERA of 1.91 in 47 innings was ninth-best in the American League of all pitchers with at least 40 innings pitched, and second-best among AL lefty relievers. He held all batters to a .191 batting average, a .265 on-base percentage, and a .299 slugging percentage.
Playing for the Twins in 2009, Breslow held left-handers to a .211 batting average and right-handers to a .226 batting average, but battled control problems in 17 appearances. 
The Twins figured they had a 50–50 chance of losing Breslow when they placed him on waivers in May 2009 to clear space on their 25-man roster for fellow left-hander Sean Henn. Oakland needed bullpen help and claimed Breslow before his 72-hour waiver period expired. Had he cleared, the Twins could have sent him to Triple-A Rochester. "We were hoping to keep him," said assistant general manager Rob Antony. "We lost a bullpen guy without trying to lose a bullpen guy," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "I kind of got shocked when they told me."
Oakland Athletics (2009–11).
2009.
Searching for an experienced left-hander for their bullpen, the Oakland Athletics claimed Breslow off waivers on May 20, 2009. According to assistant general manager David Forst, the A's had tried to acquire him on other occasions. "I'm excited about taking a look at him," A's Manager Bob Geren said. "He's a left-handed guy that's experienced. He's had some success at this level." He was the A's key lefty out of the bullpen for the remainder of the season.
He was second in the AL in appearances in 2009, with 77. Batters hit only .143 against him when there were runners in scoring position. He held all batters to a .197 batting average, and a .289 on-base percentage.
He also continued to impress teammates with his intellect. "Breslow knows everything," A's left-hander Dallas Braden said. "I seriously want to be Craig Breslow when I grow up."
2010.
Asked in 2010 whether there was a story behind his jersey number, Breslow said: "When you spend time with many organizations over 5.5 years, you don't really care what number you get."
He was second in the AL in appearances in 2010 for the second year in a row, appearing in 75 games (the fifth-highest single-season total in A's history). Only 7 of 33 inherited runners (21.2%) scored against him, third-best in the AL. He held batters to a .194 batting average, and a .272 on-base percentage. Opposing batters were 0-for-11 with zero RBIs against him with the bases loaded, which were the most bases-loaded at bats against an AL pitcher with zero RBIs since the stat was tracked beginning in 1974.
His 71 strikeouts were the most by a lefty reliever in Oakland history, breaking the mark of 69 set by Bob Lacey in 1977. He finished with a career-high 74⅔ innings; fourth among American League relievers.
He was named the 2010 Most Valuable Jewish Pitcher by Jewish Major Leaguers, as Ryan Braun won hitter honors. Through 2010, he had in his career allowed only 33 of
151 (21.9%) of inherited runners to score, which was the
fourth-best percentage among pitchers with 150 or more inherited runners since the statistic was first tracked in 1974.
2011.
In 2011, he was 0–2 with a 3.79 ERA in 67 games in which he pitched 59.1 innings. He led all relief pitchers with 5 pickoffs, and led American League relievers with 7 caught stealing.
Arizona Diamondbacks (2012).
On December 9, 2011, Breslow and Trevor Cahill were traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Ryan Cook, Jarrod Parker, and Collin Cowgill.
Since Breslow was the last arbitration-eligible player for Arizona to be under contract, he avoided arbitration and a deal was made at $1.795 million. His salary was a $395,000 increase over the 2011 season.
In 40 games, and 43.1 innings, in 2013 for Arizona before being traded, he had a 2–0 record and a 2.70 ERA with 42 strikeouts, and limited opposing batters to a .233 batting average.
Boston Red Sox redux (2012–present).
2012.
On July 31, 2012, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for outfielder Scott Podsednik and relief pitcher Matt Albers. In 23 innings in 2012 for the Red Sox, he struck out 19 and had a 2.70 ERA. He held opponents to a .206 batting average, and opposing lefties to a .184 batting average.
For the season, he was 3–0 with a 2.70 ERA in 63 games for Arizona and Boston, and held left-handed hitters to a .222 batting average.
2013.
In January 2013, he signed a two-year contract with the Red Sox for at least $6.25 million. He will receive $2.325 million in 2013, and $3.825 million in 2014. The Red Sox have a $4 million option for 2015, with a $100,000 buyout. 
He began the 2013 season on the disabled list with left shoulder tendinitis. After rehab outings with Double A Portland and Triple A Pawtucket, he was activated on May 7. He emerged as the Red Sox' primary set-up reliever.
On September 16, Breslow was named the Red Sox nominee for the 2013 Roberto Clemente Award.
In the 2013 regular season, he was 5–2 with a 1.81 ERA (third among left-handed relievers in the American League), in 61 games and 59.2 innings, and held opposing batters to a .228 batting average. His 0.65 ERA the second half of the season was fourth-best among major league relievers with at least 25 innings thrown. In his last 28 appearances of the regular season, he allowed only one run.
In the 2013 American League Division Series, he pitched 3.2 scoreless innings over 3 games, notching a win and allowing two hits and one walk while striking out four, as the Red Sox defeated Tampa Bay. In the 2013 American League Championship Series, he added 3.1 scoreless innings against the Detroit Tigers, bringing his post-season total to 7 scoreless innings in 7 appearances, in which he held the opposition to a .130 batting average. Breslow wrote a blog during the 2013 post-season.
Breslow's World Series performances against the St Louis Cardinals in 2013 were disappointing, throwing over the third baseman's head to lose Game Two and allowing 6 of the 7 base runners he inherited in relief to score. Despite this the Red Sox won the Series, their third in ten years.
Pitches.
Breslow's fastball ranges at 89–92 mph, and he has added a cut fastball in the mid-80s and a sinker. He also has a plus overhand curveball (70–75 mph), an average to above-average changeup, and a 78 mph slider/slurve. His ability to mix up his pitches is what makes him very effective.
Intelligence.
Breslow was nicknamed the "smartest man in baseball" by "Minneapolis Star Tribune" Twins beat writer La Velle E. Neal III, and "Wall Street Journal" reporter Jason Turbow wrote: "Judging by his résumé, Craig Breslow is the smartest man in baseball, if not the entire world." In 2010 the "Sporting News" named him the smartest athlete on their top-20 list. In 2012, "Men's Fitness" named him one of the Top 10 Smartest Athletes in Professional Sports. 
Referring to the reactions he has experienced to the plaudits, Breslow said: "There’s no end to the teasing I’ve taken". Red Sox manager John Farrell observed in 2013: "Breslow uses words in a normal conversation that I'm not used to."
As to the impact of his intelligence on his baseball performance, he admits that he analyzes video and looks for inefficiencies in the "kinematic system" of his delivery. At the same time, he often subscribes to the "keep it simple, stupid" principle.
Philanthropy.
In 2008, Breslow started the Strike 3 Foundation, a non-profit charity that heightens awareness, mobilizes support, and raises funding for pediatric cancer research. He oversees the charity's daily operations, including the activities of lawyers, doctors, corporate executives, and other professionals who donate their time, services, and expertise. 
The organization has teamed up with the Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Conquer Cancer Foundation of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The foundation pledged $500,000, nearly all of which it has now donated, to the Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital to help enhance their Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Program. It has also made gifts to CureSearch for Children's Cancer, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Yale's Smilow Cancer Hospital, and others.
Breslow hopes to hold annual events in Connecticut and during spring training. His first benefit raised $100,000, and his second benefit more than $85,000. The charity has raised more than $1.5 million.
In media.
Breslow's collegiate career and his first year with the Brewers organization are partially discussed in the book "" by Matt McCarthy. McCarthy and Breslow were friends and teammates at Yale, and were on rival Pioneer League teams during the 2002 season. He also starred in a parody of Rex Ryan's foot fetish video called "ihaveprettylefthand".

Ramona Quimby, Age 8

Ramona Quimby, Age 8 (1981) by Beverly Cleary is the sixth book of the popular Ramona series. Ramona Quimby is in the third grade, now at a new school, and making some new friends. With Beezus in Jr. High and Mr. Quimby going back to college, Ramona feels the pressure with everyone counting on her to manage at school by herself and get along with Willa Jean after school every day. "Ramona Quimby, Age 8" was named a Newbery Honor book in 1982.
Plot.
The schools in Ramona Quimby's neighborhood have been reorganized, and now she gets to ride the bus to Cedarhurst Primary, where she and her fellow third graders will be the biggest kids in the school. Ramona is happy about the changes until a boy on the bus steals her new eraser, but she rises to the challenge and ends up deciding the "Yard Ape" (the boy who stole her eraser) may not be so bad, after all.
Ramona feels the best part of being in third grade is Sustained Silent Reading. Ramona loves getting time to read in school every day. The worst part is that she isn't sure if her teacher, Mrs. Whaley, likes her. When Ramona cracks a hard boiled egg on her head at lunch—and finds out her mother forgot to boil it—she ends up in the secretary's office with a head full of raw egg, where she overhears Mrs. Whaley describe her as a show-off and a nuisance. Even Yard Ape can't make her feel better about that. Things get worse when she throws up in class and her mother has to leave work to take her home. 
For Ramona, there's also the problem of spoiled Willa Jean. Every day after school Howie goes outside to ride bikes with his friends, and Ramona is forced to play baby games with Willa Jean. Beezus can always say she's busy doing homework, but that doesn't work for Ramona. She strives to use her creativity to find ways to help her family get along.
Critical reception.
Critics welcomed the latest volume in this series, praising Cleary's ability to convey the real concerns of ordinary children with clarity and sensitivity. The Children's Literature review says, "Kids may easily identify with Ramona's difficulties, as Cleary depicts this 'typical' white American middle-class family with warmth and interest. Cleary tackles the difficult issue of describing a happy family with grace; the Quimby family is far from perfect, and although not poverty-stricken, they are also far from rich." 
Kirkus Reviews agree that readers will identify with Ramona, writing "Though the family has its money worries and its cranky days, things are never so bad that a Sunday dinner at the Whopperburger can't cheer them up... As always, Ramona's thought processes are amusing, touching, and revealing. Once more, Cleary shows us life through Ramona's eyes and shows her young readers that they are not alone."
In 1986, "Choosing Books for Kids" included "Ramona Quimby, Age 8" in its list of "Ten Books for Eights and Nines Too Good to Miss", and says "Cleary paints a real world kids can readily relate to."

Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen

Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen (; ) is an international airport located at Høybuktmoen, west of the town of Kirkenes, in the municipality of Sør-Varanger, Finnmark county, Norway. Operated by the state-owned Avinor, the airport has a single asphalt runway numbered 06–24. Scandinavian Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle operate Boeing 737-services to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, in part generated by Høybuktmoen's function as a hub for Widerøe's regional services to other airports in eastern Finnmark. There are also summer charter flights to Central Europe to bring tourists to the Hurtigruten cruises. The airport had 297,149 passengers in 2013.
Høybuktmoen was built as a military air station by the "Luftwaffe" during World War II. Civilian services were introduced after the war, but abandoned in 1948. The airport reopened in 1963 with a new terminal and an extended runway. Originally the airport was served by Scandinavian Airlines System and Finnair, and from the 1970s also Widerøe and Norving. Since 1990, five airlines have attempted to provide services to Murmansk, Russia. Originally the airport had two runways, long, respectively, but the smaller was closed in 1996 when the longer was extended. A new terminal building was put into use in 2006. Because of the terrain the runway's length cannot be exploited under some wind conditions, so there is a proposal to level some of the land.
History.
Construction.
The first aircraft to land in Sør-Varanger was part of a trial undertaken in 1922 by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service to test the flight time from Horten to Kirkenes. The mission was awarded to Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen and Finn Lützow-Holm, who chose to fly the 45-hour trip along the coast. The next landing was a military Fokker which landed on the iced lake of Andrevann in 1934. Widerøe undertook several flights within the municipality in 1937, offering sightseeing and undertaking aerial photography. The first scheduled service started to Kirkenes the following summer with postal flights to Tromsø flown by Widerøe on behalf of Norwegian Air Lines (DNL). The flight allowed post to be sent from Oslo to Kirkenes in one day and was continued the next season. The route was flown from Tromsø with intermediate stops at Vadsø and Hammerfest. There were public demands for passenger services be started.
Instead, in 1940 the German occupation of Norway terminated all civilian aviation until 1945. A limited service was kept in Northern Norway during the resistance, but these were terminated after the German forces took control of the whole country. From 26 September 1940, three weekly services were operated from Trondheim to Tromsø, with two of these continuing to Kirkenes, using a 16-passenger Junkers Ju-52. This was terminated on 20 March 1941, after most of the airline's pilots had fled to the United Kingdom to support the Allied forces.
Høybuktmoen was selected by the "Luftwaffe" as one of three air stations in Northern Norway, along with Bardufoss Airport and Lakselv Airport, Banak. They built two runways, long, respectively. Høybuktmoen was primarily used for attacks against the Arctic convoys. With the German withdraw in Operation Nordlicht in October 1944, the runways were blasted at several points. The damaged proved easy to repair and by January 1945, both troops of Norwegian police officers from Sweden led by Bernt Balchen and the Soviet Air Forces could land at Høybuktmoen.
Reopening.
The first service after the war was started by DNL on 13 October 1945 and flew to Tromsø, with onwards connection to Trondheim and Oslo. The service only lasted until 1948, when it was replaced with a Ju-52 seaplane route with intermediate stops at Vadsø and Hammerfest to Tromsø. The route flew one direction each day, was only operated during the summer and was plagued with poor regularity. The original water aerodrome was located at Soldatbukta at Prestøya. Later it was moved to the quay on the north side of Langfjorden, on the other side as Kirkenes. Passengers were therefore freighted across the fjord by boat to the aircraft. The air traffic control moved from Høybuktmoen to Haganes in 1949, but returned in 1963.
The route had doubled its patronage since its introduction by 1953—the last year it was operated by DNL. From 1954 the route was taken over by Widerøe, who introduced smaller Noorduyn Norseman and de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter aircraft. The Widerøe seaplane service was flown on behalf of DNL and later Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and remained until 1963. Varangfly—based in Kirkenes—was established in 1959 by general aviation enthusiasts from Kirkenes Flyklubb. The airline originally had two seaplanes, a two-seat Piper J-3 Cub and a five-seat Norsk Flyindustri C-5 Polar. Operations started on 17 June 1960. The company gradually developed services within scheduled, charter and air ambulance services. Varangfly later also bought an eight-seat land aircraft which was operated to Lakselv and Bardufoss, and to Ivalo Airport in Finland, where i corresponded with Finnair's service to Helsinki.
Planning for a new airport at Høybunktmoen was initiated by a committee established by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in 1947, and resulted in the National Plan of 1952. Although Kirkenes was included in the plan construction was placed on hold, both because of high costs and because other airports further south had to be completed before or at the same time. Construction at Høybuktmoen started in 1961 and the airport opened on 4 May 1963. Work consisted of expanding the east–west runway to and building a new passenger terminal and control tower; the latter two were not completed in time for the opening. Alta Airport and Lakselv Airport, Banak opened the same year, and Tromsø Airport followed suit the following year.
Operational history.
SAS introduced the 52-passenger Convair Metropolitan on their domestic services, while Finnair served the airport with the 30-seat Douglas DC-3 on their flights to Finland. In the first month the two airlines had 88 aircraft movements, while the Royal Norwegian Air Force had 44 and Varangfly 60. Both SAS and Finnair replaced Varangfly's routes, which did not operate scheduled flights from the new airport. Varangfly therefore sold its land aircraft and instead became a seaplane operator. SAS introduced the 122-passenger Douglas DC-9 jet aircraft at Kirkenes from 1969. Helikopter Service flew a civilian helicopter to Høybuktmoen for the first time the same year. Kirkenes Airport served 20,638 passengers in 1964 and 40,477 in 1970.
Busy Bee was contracted by the Norwegian Armed Forces to fly military charters in June 1968. They had two 50-passenger Fokker F27 Friendships stationed at Høybuktmoen and flew two daily services from Kirkenes and other locations in Northern Norway to Bodø, with onwards connection to Stavanger and Oslo on Fridays. This arrangement continued until Busy Bee's bankruptcy in 1992.
Varangfly merged with two other airlines in 1970 to create the Kirkenes-based Norving. The new airline bought an eight-passenger Britten Norman Islander and started round trips between Kirkenes and the newly upgraded Berlevåg Airport and Mehamn Airport. This was later followed up with routes to Hasvik Airport and Kjøllefjord Airport, and in 1975 to Båtsfjord Airport and Vadsø Airport. On the other hand, Widerøe received the concessions to operate to Hammerfest Airport, which opened on 1 August 1973, and Honningsvåg Airport, which opened in 1977. To serve the regional services Widerøe originally operated twenty-passenger de Havilland Canada aircraft.
Finnair terminated their services to Kirkenes in 1975. At the same time the ministry and SAS started looking at the airport structure in Finnmark, as all the services in the county were in need of subsidies. The proposals were either for a hike in the ticket prices or a reduction of Kirkenes to a regional-only airport. SAS was flying a 90-seat aircraft two to three times per day between Kirkenes and Alta with only ten to fifteen passengers. The airport structure was kept, but ticket prices continued to rise. The airport served 110,000 passengers in 1983. Norving continued Varangfly's air ambulance contract until 1987, when the service was taken over by Air Express. Later the contract was awarded to Lufttransport, who operated the Beechcraft Super King Air. Norving filed for bankruptcy in 1992 and their routes were taken over by Widerøe.
SAS Commuter was established in 1988 and started operations in Northern Norway in May 1990. This involved a change to the operations so that all DC-9 services from Kirkenes to Oslo were terminated and instead Fokker 50 services were introduced to Alta and Tromsø. SAS was able to reduce costs by no longer operating local routes with the DC-9 and instead increased the number of flights. The new system was met with massive opposition in Kirkenes. Emergency meetings were being held between SAS Commuter and the ministry by June 1990 because of low regularity and many cancellations. Non-transfer flights from Kirkenes to Oslo were reintroduced on 1 April 1992, albeit with the services stopping at Tromsø.
Service between Kirkenes and Murmansk Airport were initiated by SAS Commuter in 1990, but the airline quickly terminated the service. Aeroflot started two weekly services between Kirkenes and Murmansk and onwards to Arkhangelsk Airport in June 1990. The service was summer-only until 1992, when they increased to an all-year service. Norving also started a service from Kirkenes to Murmansk, but their service terminated with the airline failing. Widerøe started two weekly services between Kirkenes and Murmansk in 1994, using Twin Otter aircraft. Aeroflot terminated their service in 1998 and Widerøe followed suit in 2000.
The runway was extended eastwards by in the late 1990s. The first expansion took place in 1996 and the second in 2000. The extensions never received operating permit from the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway as there are two hills which hinder aircraft landing from the east to follow a safe final approach.
Arctic Air took over Widerøe's flights to Vardø in 2000, using a 19-passenger Dornier Do 228. They also flew a service to Murmansk in 2001 and 2002. They lost the Vardø–Kirkenes contract back to Widerøe in 2003. SAS bought Braathens in 2002, resulting in the latter taking over the service and increasing to two daily flights to Oslo. SAS and Braathens merged in 2004 to form SAS Braathens. The airline changed its name back to Scandinavian Airlines in 2007. Norwegian Air Shuttle started flights from Kirkenes to Oslo in 2004, at first with four weekly services. The terminal building was almost unchanged since 1963, although it had seem some smaller upgrades. Avinor decided in 2004 that the terminal would be upgraded, consisting a new road to the airport, parking lot, tarmac and terminal. The investments cost NOK 180 million and opened on 4 May 2006. Widerøe reopened its Murmansk service in August 2007, but low patronage caused the airline to terminate the route from December 2008. SAS reduced from two to one daily trip to Oslo in 2008.
Facilities.
The airport is located at Høybuktmoen in Sør-Varanger, about west of Kirkenes. The terminal has place for six category C aircraft (Airbus A320/Boeing 737). During summer the airport experiences a very high traffic peak with both scheduled and charter aircraft arriving at the same time, as both intend to correspond with Hurtigruten; this causes patronage to rise beyond the airport's capacity. Kirkenes Airport had a revenue of NOK 26.4 million in 2009, of which commercial income made up fifteen percent, and an operating deficit of NOK 45.4 million. The deficit is cross subsidized by profits at Avinor's largest airports. In 2013, the airport had 297,149 passengers, 8,643 aircraft movements and 367 tonnes of cargo.
The runway is located southwest–northeast (06–24) and is . The touchdown zone from the west is from the start of the runway, while it is from the east. There are no parallel taxiways, but two taxiways run from the runway to the tarmac. Because of the terrain to the east the maximum take-off lengths on the runway vary depending on the direction: it is only from the east compared to from the west. Runway 24 is equipped with instrument landing system. There is also a closed runway located normally to the main runway (14–32). It is long and gravel; part of the length has been paved and is used as a taxiway.
The airport is located next to European Road E6. Boreal Transport operates an airport coach service from Kirkenes to the airport in connection with all arrivals and departures. The company also serves the airport with coach services from Kirkenes to other parts of Finnmark. Parking, taxis and car rental is available at the airport.
Airlines and destinations.
Three airlines serve the airport with scheduled flights. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Norwegian Air Shuttle both operate a daily flight to Oslo, with SAS operating two services per day during summer; both airlines use the Boeing 737. Widerøe flies to various regional airports in Finnmark and Troms, and uses Kirkenes as a hub to feed regional passengers to Oslo flights. Widerøe operates its eight daily services with de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft. Hamburg International operates charter services from Germany from May to September on behalf of Hurtigruten Group with tourist transferring to the Hurtigruten coastal voyage. There are sporadic charters of fishermen operated by Atlantic Airways.
Future.
In the period 2015 to 2020, Avinor plans to build a new control tower and a new fire- and rescue station. The former is located too close to the runway while the latter is too small and out of date. There are also plans to expand the terminal building to allow the simultaneous handling of two large and two small aircraft. Finnmark County Municipality is considering establishing a fast ferry service between Kirkenes and Vadsø which would have a service time of 45 minutes. There is a possibility of marketing Kirkenes as an alternative airport for Murmansk as Kirkenes can offer cheaper flights to Oslo than what is available from Murmansk to Moscow.
Avinor has also proposed lowering the terrain east of the airport. The terrain is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in that direction, the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact on the performance of Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.
The project was estimated to cost 267 million Norwegian krone. Estimates show that the benefit for society would be lower than the investment costs (a negative net present value), giving an average estimated NOK 124 million deficit. Norwegian Air Shuttle is building a unified fleet of 737-800 aircraft and will only be able to serve the airport during winter if the investments are carried out. The extension would allow increased charter traffic to Central Europe and increased regularity with existing flights. Avinor has stated that it cannot finance the investments without direct subsidies from the state.

Sun Park is a Korean-born Australian singer, actress, entertainer and former member of the children's entertainment group Hi-5. She achieved her first successful career move to popularity in 2006, at 25, when she was originally hired as a temporary replacement for Kathleen de Leon, who went on maternity leave. However in July 2007, Kathleen announced that she would not be returning, in order to devote her time to raising a family. Therefore, Sun took over her place permanently.
Pre-professional life & career.
Sun graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Business Administration, Finance. She later appeared in the Brisbane and Sydney seasons of Mamma Mia!. Before her stint with Hi-5, she toured with the live act "BPM - Beats Per Minute" that fused funk, rock, jazz and hip hop music, and worked with the Australian band Rogue Traders, alongside the now very successful Natalie Bassingthwaighte.
In 2006, she was hired as a temporary replacement for entertainer Kathleen de Leon in the children's entertainment group Hi-5, and was announced as a permanent replacement in 2007 when Leon confirmed she would not be returning to the group.
In December 2008, Sun announced that she would be leaving Hi-5 after three years with the group in order to concentrate on settling down and starting a family. She also expressed that she felt she was only ever meant to be a temporary replacement for Kathleen. Sun's final performance with the group was at the 2008 Carols by Candlelight.
As an actress she appeared in the 2007 Australian movie The Jammed, and stars playing the main role of Rubi, a young girl that had moved from China to Melbourne and found herself a victim of the Victorian sex slave trade. She worked alongside Emma Lung and Saskia Burmeister in The Jammed. The film received mainly positive reviews, and was nominated for many Australian film awards along with the actors. She has also appeared many other Australian shows.
Personal life.
Sun told the media in 2008 that she was going to settle down and focus on starting a family after finishing her work with Australian children's entertainment group Hi-5. She announced plans to marry in 2009, however it is unknown to the public whether the marriage went ahead or not.
It was eventually revealed that she married business development worker Nathan Pezzimenti in 2009.
Musical Artistry.
Sun is a kid's entertainer, but other than Hi-5, she seems to specialise in funk, rock, jazz and hip hop fusion. As she has performed and worked with the Rogue Traders before, it can also be assumed that she partakes in contemporary rock as well.

Arturo Colombi (born January 6, 1958) is an Argentine Radical Civic Union (UCR) politician, and former governor of Corrientes Province. 
Born in Mercedes, Corrientes, and educated at the National University of the Northeast with a degree in civil engineering, Colombi served as provincial Minister of Public Works in the administration of then-governor, his cousin Ricardo Colombi. He was elected governor of the province in 2005, when Ricardo Colombi resigned to stand for a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. 
Colombi was a leading UCR supporter of Peronist President Néstor Kirchner, and led the Frente de Todos coalition between the UCR and justicialists in the October 2005 elections, supported by Kirchner. In 2007, he successfully led the Corrientes Province party list supported by presidential candidate Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in elections to congressional seats, but was opposed by his cousin and former ally, Ricardo Colombi.
Like his ally, Vice-President Julio Cobos, Colombi became estranged from the Kirchners during the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector. His bid to for re-election as governor in 2009 was in opposition to both Kirchnerism and to the UCR, which nominated Ricardo Colombi. Amid both family and political acrimony, the latter won the election in the second round, and Arturo Colombi left office without attending his successor's inaugural.

Duck and Cover (The Wire)

"Duck and Cover" is the eighth episode of the second season of the HBO original series, "The Wire". The episode was written by George Pelecanos from a story by David Simon & George Pelecanos and was directed by Dan Attias. It originally aired on July 20, 2003.
Production.
Title reference.
The title refers in part to Ziggy's pet duck. It also refers to Frank's realization that the docks are under surveillance and to the coverup measures he has to take. This could also be seen as a warning call to surrounding characters or the audience of McNulty's actions after his failed reconciliation with his ex-wife.
Epigraph.
Ziggy asks why the ducks don't leave their cages when they are free to do so, the reason being that their wings are clipped. This serves as a metaphor for many of the groups in The Wire, and the individuals that find themselves in some way caged—the stevedores, the illegal immigrants, D'Angelo, the police, the corner boys.
Non-fiction elements.
Ziggy references Stephen L. Miles, a Baltimore lawyer remembered by locals due to the local-run late night commercial advertising his firm.
Credits.
Starring cast.
Although credited, Idris Elba, Frankie Faison, Wood Harris and Andre Royo do not appear in this episode. This is notable for being the first episode where Idris Elba does not appear.
Plot.
Summary.
McNulty.
Jimmy McNulty deals with the disappointment of his failed reconciliation with his wife by returning to his old drinking habits. He gets drunk and tries to drive home from the bar. When he crashes into a bridge abutment while turning a corner he refuses to believe he misjudged the turn, reverses back and hits it again, cutting his hand. He then gets some food at a diner and ends up having a one-night stand with the waitress. He wakes up the next morning hung over, with the cut in his hand having bled onto the bed. 
He spends another evening drinking with Bunk Moreland at the train yard. He asks about the detail and admits wanting to work with them again. He can't express his feelings but seems to want to say without a case to work or his family he is worthless.
By the end of the episode, McNulty finds his way on the case he has worked on as part of his personal moral crusade since the beginning of the season.
Sobotka detail.
The detail meets with Assistant State's Attorney Rhonda Pearlman and they give her a report on their case to date. Their investigation of phone logs from George "Double G" Glekas's warehouse links to "White" Mike McArdle, Petey Dixon and Proposition Joe. Kima Greggs's photos confirm the link. They have identified Sergei "Serge" Malatov and tracked his cell phone through his truck rental paperwork. His phone records show that he calls the warehouse every day that a container goes missing.
Lieutenant Cedric Daniels introduces Thomas "Herc" Hauk and Ellis Carver's linking of Nick Sobotka to the drug dealer Frog, which they have falsely reported as being obtained from an informant. Pearlman admits there is probable cause for wiretaps on Sergei's cell phone and the warehouse phone and checks their efforts to prove exhaustion. Pearlman checks over their paper work and takes it to the duty judge. The judge signs off on the request but has Herc and Carver move and install an air conditioner and wash his windows in exchange.
Lester Freamon and Bunk appeal to Daniels to help McNulty by going back to Colonel William Rawls. Rawls again tells Daniels no on McNulty's transfer. Daniels then brings up his agreement to take on investigating the murders and Rawls capitulates based on the hope that Daniels can clear his homicides. Daniels calls McNulty to let him know he is back.
In a scheme to recover the $1,250 Carver lost on the destroyed wireless mic, Herc gets his cousin Bernard to pose for photos as their fake informant, Fuzzy Dunlop (the fake name is based on what Herc and Carver named the tennis ball that held the hidden microphone since the ball is made by Dunlop and is fuzzy). Bernard insists on 10% of the CI payments. Carver hands the paperwork to Daniels who balks at the name and high price of $150 but signs it anyway. Herc and Carver grin over the success of the scheme.
Pearlman meets with Greggs and Bunk to discuss how to proceed with the investigation of the vice aspect of the smuggling. They tell her that they have found that the same company owns the warehouse and the apartments. They speculate that the apartments are being used as a cat house. They decide they need someone to go undercover to infiltrate the apartment as a john. No one seems like a good fit for the job, until McNulty shows up for duty for the first time and—much to the amusement of the rest of the detail—becomes the obvious choice.
Greggs and McNulty set up surveillance of the parking garage at the apartment building. They pull over one of the johns and get him to explain how to contact the madam. They also note the girls are being driven in via panel truck.
Beadie Russell, Roland "Prez" Pryzbylewski and Freamon notice another potential container theft from the docks - a Transco lines ship with Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa working as checker. This time the surveillance work runs in combination with the wiretaps and the detail tracks the container to the warehouse. When Frank Sobotka sends out a second container (a clean decoy), McNulty rushes to tail it. Beadie Russell arranges to slow down the rig with a fictitious traffic stop, until McNulty can get into position.
Dock business.
The stevedores continue to mock Ziggy Sobotka, egging him on to retaliate against Maui's taunting. When he eventually does, the sucker punch is pathetic—Maui easily bests him, pins him down and has a forklift bring them to the top of a two-story container. Maui throws him on the top and warns the laughing stevedores not to rescue Ziggy from his predicament. Ziggy curses the other stevedores, yelling "You gave me bad advice!"
When Horseface reports the fight to Frank Sobotka, Sobotka is more worried about their month-end finances than his son's latest screw-up. He goes to pay his 90-day overdue cellphone bill but learns that his account is "flagged" to not be cut off—a possible clue that law enforcement is monitoring their activity. Horseface dismisses this as paranoia. Later, Sobotka spots Greggs on the docks when she is posing as an engineer to watch the smuggling operation. His suspicions are raised enough to ask after Beatrice Russell and he learns she lied when she told him she was transferring to Fairfield—the other port authority officers tell him she is detailed to the Baltimore City police. He decides to send out a clean container to test the waters. Sobotka notices the container being stopped and goes to call the Greek but realizes his cell phone is unsafe. He uses the untapped office phone to set up a meeting with The Greek.
Frank meets with his brother Louis and offers him a position with the port advisory board—a position that was clearly made available to Louis after Frank made a generous contribution. Louis refuses the offer saying it's not for him. He insists that everything he has comes straight. Frank tries to claim the only difference between them is that he chose the right union but Louis disagrees. Frank is infuriated that Louis has a sense of moral superiority over his choices.
Ziggy buys a duck from a neighborhood man who keeps birds. He meets with his cousin Nick and admires his new car. Nick asks him about his fight with Maui and can't hide his amusement. Ziggy takes the duck to Delores's bar, entertaining the other stevedores with duck jokes, and the bird's propensity to drink whiskey and beer on top of the bar.
At the warehouse George "Double G" Glekas and Sergei unload the clean container and angrily phone Spiros "Vondas" Vondopoulos at the cafe. The police trace the call and recognize it as the same number that Frank dialed. Vondas instructs Sergei to dump the container and McNulty follows it far enough to make sure, but is then recalled by Daniels.
Frank drinks with Nick and discusses their problems with the investigation. He asks Nick to accompany him to the meeting. The Greek is impressed by Frank's caution, suggesting they only move clean containers for a while. Nick and Frank insist that they must still be paid in full for moving the containers and The Greek agrees to their terms because he expects them to continue to do good business in the future.
After the switch.
The police dismiss the non-contraband container as a mistake, but Freamon is nevertheless pleased to have obtained the number of Vondas's phone. McNulty and Beadie go for a drink and discuss their past relationships. McNulty drives her because her car is in need of repair. While at the bar McNulty calls the number for the madam and sets up an appointment. McNulty has another drink at Beadie's home but leaves quickly when he sees pictures of her children, realizing nothing good could come out of a sexual encounter with Beadie.
Barksdale organization.
Bodie Broadus and Poot Carr walk through their territory bemoaning the lack of trade because of their weak product. Puddin has a similar story from the towers. Later they notice an independent crew dealing on their territory with far more success than they have been getting.
Bodie and Poot organize a crew to strike back against the dealers on their territory. They make an early start and beat them to their corner. When the other crew arrive they successfully drive them away but expect retaliation.

<doc id="5960013" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5960013" title="Longhorn cowfish">
Longhorn cowfish

The longhorn cowfish, "Lactoria cornuta", is a variety of boxfish from the family Ostraciidae, recognizable by its long horns that protrude from the front of its head, rather like those of a cow or bull. They are a resident of the Indo-Pacific region and can grow up to 20 inches long. While badly suited to the home aquarium, the cowfish is becoming increasingly popular as a pet.
Adults are reef fish, often solitary and territorial, live around sand or rubble bottom up to a depth of 50 m. They are omnivorous, feeding upon benthic algae, various microorganisms, and foraminiferans that it strains from sediments, sponges, polychaete worms from sand flats, mollusks, small crustaceans, and small fishes, able to feed on benthic invertebrates by blowing jets of water into the sandy substrate.
Habitat.
Its primary habitat is coral reefs in lagoons, on reef flats, and on protected seaward reefs. Juveniles associate with Acropora corals. Depth range is 3.3–148 ft (1–45 m, perhaps up to 100 m).
Range.
Red Sea and East Africa eastward through Indonesia to Marquesas, northward to southern Japan. Including Tuamotus, southern Korea, north to the Ryukyu Islands of southern Japan, south to Australia and Lord Howe Island, and off southern Africa in the Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical waters.
Physiology.
There is no known sexual dimorphism, so both male and female display a yellow to olive base color, which is decorated with white or bluish spots. Paired courtship just before or after sunset. Eggs and larvae are pelagic.
One distinction from other fish is the lack of a gill cover, which is replaced by a small slit or hole.
The hexagonal plate-like scales of these fish are fused together into a solid, triangular, box-like carapace, from which the fins and tail protrude. 
Their unique method of swimming, called ostraciform swimming, causes them to look as if they are hovering.
They have no pelvic skeleton, so they lack pelvic fins.
They are such slow swimmers cowfish are easily caught by hand, making a grunting noise when captured.
This is the most well-known cowfish species in the aquarium trade.
Defense.
If severely stressed, this species may be able to exude deadly toxin, ostracitoxin, an ichthyotoxic, hemolytic, heat-stable, non-dialyzable, non-protein poison in the mucous secretions of their skin. It is apparently unique among known fish poisons; it is toxic to boxfish and resembles red tide and sea cucumber toxins in general properties.

Vice squeeze

The Vice is an advanced squeeze in contract bridge. Its distinguishing motive is presence of a "vice" menace in one suit, where one defender holds cards of equivalent rank which split the declarer's pair of cards in front of him, where his partner has a winner in the suit. It was first attested by Terence Reese in the book "The Expert Game", a.k.a. "Master Play in Contract Bridge". In other words, the defenders have a "high" finesse position, equivalent to the one in diagram:
If West can be forced to abandon QJ, the defenders will take only one trick in the suit.
A similar motive is encountered in guard squeezes, however, in the vice, the defenders have a winner in the suit. Since that winner will take a trick, this squeeze is without .

Apocalypse Please

"Apocalypse Please", also known as "Emergency", is a song by English alternative rock band Muse, featured on their 2003 third studio album "Absolution". Written by lead vocalist, guitarist and pianist Matthew Bellamy, a live version of the song was released as a digital download single on 23 August 2004, from which approximately 70% of all proceeds were donated to Oxfam. The song reached number ten on the first edition of the UK Official Download Chart, announced on 1 September 2004. 
Background.
"Apocalypse Please" was originally recorded with an orchestral backing, which was removed simply for being, according to Bellamy, "too much." Drummer Dominic Howard described the song as "a very theatrical song about religious fanatics and their wish that their prophecies come true [...] So that they can confirm their religion." Producer Rich Costey explained, in an interview with "Sound on Sound" in 2003, that "really wanted ["Apocalypse Please" to sound just ridiculous and as epic as possible," revealing that "the studio had a swimming pool [...] and what we did was bring over a couple of kick drums, put them on stands, and miked one of them really close [...] to get a low, thumping sound," in order to create the desired result.
Release.
"Apocalypse Please" was released on "Absolution" as the second track on the album, succeeding an instrumental percussion-based intro and preceding the single "Time Is Running Out". Along with the single release, Muse ran a competition to win a signed and framed set list, also in conjunction with Oxfam. In 2005, "Apocalypse Please" was featured on the live video album "Absolution Tour"; in 2008, it was also featured on the DVD edition of the live album "HAARP".

Provoleta

Provoleta is a trademark for an Argentine variant of provolone cheese described as "Argentine pulled-curd Provolone cheese." It is eaten barbecued in Argentina and Uruguay.
The cheese was developed by Natalio Alba in about 1940, and the PROVOLETA trademark was established in 1963. The cheese is produced with a pulled-curd (pasta filata) technique is used.
Small discs of locally-produced provolone cheese of 10 to 15 cm in diameter and 1 to 2 cm in height are often eaten at the start of an "asado", before the grilled meat. The provolone, often topped with chilli and oregano, is placed directly on the grill, on small stones or inside a foil plate, and cooked until part-melted. The provoleta may be seasoned with "chimichurri", a mixture of oils and spices, and is usually eaten communally with bread.

The Bird That Drinks Tears

The Bird That Drinks Tears (Korean: 눈물을 마시는 새 " Nunmuleul Masineun sae", abbreviated as 눈마새 "Nunmasae") is a series of Korean fantasy novels by Lee Yeongdo. A rare example of the genre Korean Fantasy, the stock characters and clichés of normal western fantasy such as elves, magic, dragons and Latin languages are instead replaced by Korean concepts such as dokkaebi, ssirum, and the Arajit language based on Proto-Korean language.
Publishing.
The novel was first serialized in Hitel, an internet forum site, continuing the tradition that all novels by Lee Yeongdo are first serialized in the internet. After the conclusion of the serial, the book was later published through Golden Bough, a publishing company of South Korea. Due to its length, the story was published in four hardcover volumes.
Main characters.
Keigon Draka (케이건 드라카) - A mysterious human who hunts and eats nagas. He is chosen as the "pathfinder" of the Rescue Party that must rescue a naga and bring the naga to Haensha Archtemple. His name consists of two animals that were made extinct by the naga; his first name 'Kaigon,' means black lion, and his last name Draka, means Dragon.
Beehyung Srable (비형 스라블) - A cheerful dokkaebi, the butler of castlemaster. He is chosen as the "magician" of the Rescue Party.
Tinahan (티나한) - An arrogant lekon who dreams of climbing on the back of a Sky Fish. He is chosen as the "defeater" of the Rescue Party.
Ryoon Pei (륜 페이) - A young naga who is haunted by the murder of his father, which he witnessed when he was eleven years old. He is sent on a mission to leave Keyboren and reach Haensha Archtemple, where he must try to save all four races. Because of death of his father, he fears extracting his heart and ran away from the heart extraction ritual. His name derives from hanja "ryoon"(輪), which means 'wheel'.
Samo Pei (사모 페이) - A female naga renowned for her dancing and swordsmanship. She is also kind to naga males, which is uncommon behavior in naga society. As a result, the Pei family is popular among males, and Samo becomes an object of jealousy among other families. She is the elder sister of Ryoon Pei. When Ryoon is accused of murder, she sets out to assassinate her brother, according to naga tradition. She later becomes the King of the northern army and fights against the Naga's invasion.
Races.
The fictional world of "The Bird That Drinks Tears" is inhabited by four major intelligent races - Human, naga, lekon and dokkaebi. Other than the humankind, the races that appear in "The Bird That Drinks Tears" are in most respects Lee Yeongdo's original creations, even though the race of naga and dokkaebi originates from Indian and Korean legends, respectively.
Each race has an individual god, who have their own element that they command. They also gave their respective races a gift.
Human - The God who is Nowhere (어디에도 없는 신). His element is wind; wind comes and goes, but is never at one place. His gift is "Naneui"(나늬), a human woman who is perceived as beautiful to all four races. 
Naga - The Goddess who Leaves No Trail (발자국 없는 여신). Her element is water; water does not leave a trail in its path. Her gift is her name, which the protectors (male naga priests) can use to directly communicate with the goddess.
Dokkaebi - The God who Kills Himself (자신을 죽이는 신). His element is fire; fire uses up fuel in order to keep burning, eventually killing itself. His Gift is the power to control fire.
Lekon - The Goddess who is Lower Than All (모든이보다 낮은 여신). Her element is earth; the earth is beneath everyone. Her Gift is Star-steel(별철), which cannot be broken and never rusts.
Animals.
Dragon(용, yong) - Unlike other fantasy novels, dragons in this world are a plant-like species that propagate with spores. When environment is favorable for the dragon to grow, leaves and flower sprout from the spore, while its root develops into a "Yonggeun"(Dragon root). Then, the root grows into a Dragon. Like plants, the growth of a dragon reflects the environment that it is raised in; if it grows with horses, the dragon may become a flying horse. If it grows in the sea, dragon can develop webbed feet. If necessary, a dragon can become nearly humanoid. It was hunted to extinction by the naga, because dragon can get fire to the forest.
Black Lion(흑사자, Heuksaja) - They possess fur that emits heat. They were hunted to extinction by the naga, who wished to use their heat emitting hide as a means to attack the north. 
"Haenulchi"(하늘치; Sky Fish) - Huge flying fish. They carry mysterious ruins on their backs. Beetles seem to fear Sky Fish for some unknown reason.
Beetle(딱정벌레, Ttakjeongbeolre) - Instead of horses, Dokkaebi breed huge flying beetles as a means of transportation. Dokkaebis managed to teach beetles sign language, and beetles use their antennae to communicate with Dokkaebi. They are usually large enough to carry up to two people (one, if the person happens to be a Lekon).
King Eagle(왕독수리, Wangdoksuri) - Giant eagles, bigger than alligators
Daeho(대호; Big Tiger)
Sequels.
Currently, Lee Yeongdo has written only one sequel to "The Bird That Drinks Tears" which is "The Bird That Drinks Blood". 
It is expected that Lee Yeongdo will write two more sequels, because of the quote in the series that mentions four birds. In the book there is a riddle about four bird brothers. One bird drank water, one drank poison, one drank blood and one drank tears. The riddle asks who of the four birds will die first. This riddle appears repeatedly throughout both "The Bird That Drinks Tears" and "The Bird That Drinks Blood", and is entwined with many of the themes that run through two series.
Because of this riddle, many people expect that Lee Yeongdo will write two more sequels to this Bird series, "The Bird That Drinks Poison" and "The Bird That Drinks Water". However, Lee Yeongdo has not yet confirmed this rumour and whether he would actually continue to finish all four birds is still unknown.

SMS Karlsruhe

SMS "Karlsruhe" was a light cruiser of the built by the German "Kaiserliche Marine" (Imperial Navy). She had one sister ship, ; the ships were very similar to the previous s. The ship was laid down in 1911, launched in November 1912, and completed by January 1914. Armed with twelve 10.5 cm SK L/45 guns, "Karlsruhe" had a top speed of , which allowed her to escape from British cruisers during her career.
After her commissioning, "Karlsruhe" was assigned to overseas duties in the Caribbean. She arrived in the area in July 1914, days before the outbreak of World War I. Once the war began, she armed the passenger liner SS "Kronprinz Wilhelm", but while the ships were transferring equipment, British ships located them and pursued "Karlsruhe". Her superior speed allowed her to escape, after which she operated off the northeastern coast of Brazil. Here, she captured or sank sixteen ships. While en route to attack the shipping lanes to Barbados on 4 November 1914, a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship and killed the majority of the crew. The survivors used one of "Karlsruhe"s colliers to return to Germany in December 1914.
Construction.
"Karlsruhe" was ordered under the contract name ""Ersatz" " and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel on 21 September 1911. She was christened by Karl Siegrist, the mayor of Karlsruhe, and launched on 11 November 1912, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 15 January 1914. The ship was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of Marine steam turbines driving two propellers. They were designed to give , but reached in service. These were powered by twelve coal-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers and two oil-fired double-ended boilers. These gave the ship a top speed of . "Karlsruhe" carried of coal, and an additional of oil that gave her a range of approximately at . "Karlsruhe" had a crew of 18 officers and 355 enlisted men.
The ship was armed with twelve 10.5 cm SK L/45 guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, eight were located amidships, four on either side, and two were side by side aft. The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,800 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. She was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside. She could also carry 120 mines. The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was thick amidships. The conning tower had thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to 60 mm thick armor plate.
Service history.
"Karlsruhe"s first commanding officer was "Fregattenkapitän" Fritz Lüdecke. Following her commissioning in January 1914, "Karlsruhe" was assigned to overseas service, under the command of "Fregattenkapitän" Erich Köhler. At the outbreak of World War I the following August, the ship was based in the Caribbean, along with the cruiser . She had anchored in Cay Sal Bank in the Florida Strait when she received warnings that war in Europe was imminent. "Karlsruhe"s standing orders in the event of war saw the ship conducting a commerce raiding campaign against British merchant traffic. To hunt down "Karlsruhe" and any merchant ships she might arm as auxiliary cruisers, the Royal Navy deployed five cruiser squadrons, the most powerful were those commanded by Rear Admiral Christopher Craddock and Rear Admiral Archibald Stoddart. The British were forced to disperse their ships to cover the areas in which the two German cruisers, and any auxiliary cruisers they might arm, could operate.
On 6 August, "Karlsruhe" rendezvoused with the passenger ship SS "Kronprinz Wilhelm" about north of Watling Island. "Karlsruhe" was in the process of transferring guns and equipment to the liner when Craddock, in his flagship , appeared to the south. The Germans had only managed to transfer two 8.8 cm guns, a machine gun, and some sailors by the time "Suffolk" arrived. The two ships quickly departed in different directions; "Suffolk" followed "Karlsruhe" and other cruisers were ordered to intercept her. "Karlsruhe"s faster speed allowed her to quickly outpace Craddock, but at 20:15, joined the pursuit and briefly fired on the German cruiser. The German gunners scored two hits on "Bristol" during the short engagement. "Karlsruhe" turned east and again used her high speed to evade the British ships. The British failed to relocate her, and by 9 August, "Karlsruhe" reached Puerto Rico with only 12 tons of coal in her bunkers.
With limited options for coal in the Caribbean, Köhler took his ship down to the northeast coast of Brazil, off Pernambuco. The area was not as heavily patrolled by the British. Here, "Karlsruhe" had easy access to coal supplies, either from chartered colliers or captured vessels. Köhler frequently kept one or two prizes to assist in the search for targets. In the course of her patrols off the Brazilian coast, "Karlsruhe" sank or captured sixteen merchant ships. These merchantmen, fifteen British ships and one Dutch vessel, totaled . Köhler then decided to move to another area, as remaining in one area would increase his chances of being tracked down by the British. He turned his ship toward the West Indies to attack Barbados and Fort-de-France and the shipping lanes between Barbados and Trinidad. 
As "Karlsruhe" steamed to Barbados on the night of 4 November, a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship. The hull was split in half; the bow section quickly sank and took with it Köhler and most of the crew. The stern remained afloat long enough for 140 of the ship's crew to escape onto the attending colliers. Commander Studt, the senior surviving officer, took charge and placed all of his men aboard the liner "Rio Negro". He scuttled the second collier and steamed north for Iceland. The ship used the cover of a major storm to slip through the British blockade of the North Sea, and put in at Ålesund, Norway. "Rio Negro" then returned to Germany by early December. The "Admiralstab", unaware of the loss of "Karlsruhe", coincidentally radioed the ship to order her to return to Germany. Germany kept the loss of the ship a secret, and the British continued searching for her until they learned of her fate in March 1915. Köhler's widow christened the cruiser "Karlsruhe", the third to bear the name, at her launching in August 1927.

Sudbury, Ontario tornado

The Sudbury tornado was an F3 tornado, which hit the Canadian city of Sudbury, Ontario at approximately 8:30 a.m. on August 20, 1970.
It is currently tied for the status of the eighth deadliest tornado in Canadian history.
Storm.
Considered unusual because tornadoes of this strength rarely occur in Northern Ontario, the tornado touched down in the suburban community of Lively. The tornado tracked quickly eastward into the city, hitting the neighbourhoods of Copper Cliff, Robinson and Lockerby over the next ten minutes. Another tornado associated with the same storm also hit the community of Field, approximately 50 kilometres east of Sudbury, less than an hour later. 
The storm continued through North Bay, uprooting some trees in the wilderness but avoiding any damage to the city. It then tracked southeasterly toward Ottawa, leading the federal government to order a precautionary shutdown of its offices in the capital, but the storm weakened around Chalk River and only a few millimetres of rain actually fell on Ottawa by the time it reached that city.
Residents of the region had little warning of the storm as the Sudbury Airport did not at the time have weather radar capable of detecting tornado activity, and the day's only weather forecast was for "showers". The first public indication of the twister, instead, was a phone call to CKSO from a woman frantically reporting that her house was blowing away. 
Six people died and 200 were injured in the tornado, which caused an estimated $17 million ($ in dollars) in damage, including to Inco's copper smelter in Copper Cliff. A pipeline carrying iron-nickel concentrate to the plant collapsed onto a train track below, in turn causing a derailment when a train hit the collapsed pipe, but the incident resulted in only minor injuries. The Inco Superstack, then under construction, swayed in the storm but was not heavily damaged. Six workers were on the construction platform at the time; although all six survived, they quit their jobs the next day.
Minor damage was also reported to the Big Nickel, with some pitting of the stainless steel panels as rocks and debris hit the monument, although that structure also survived. Damage was also reported to Memorial Hospital, Glad Tidings Tabernacle, and over 300 homes in Lively, Sudbury and Field. Some streets in the affected neighbourhoods were flooded by up to a foot of water, and electrical and communications infrastructure was heavily damaged. For several days after the storm, amateur radio remained the only reliable method of communication into and out of the city. 
In Field, a lumber mill which was the town's primary employer was heavily damaged, and a church roof was ripped off just minutes after parishioners had left the building after the end of the morning mass.
Aftermath.
Joe Fabbro, the mayor of Sudbury, and Len Turner, the mayor of Lively, each declared their respective communities disaster areas. Both the federal and provincial governments immediately sent representatives to the city to assist, including provincial Attorney General Arthur Wishart, provincial municipal affairs minister Darcy McKeough and federal housing minister Robert Andras. With the company's operations temporarily disabled in the aftermath of the storm, Inco reassigned its employees to assist in rebuilding homes in Lively, which was at the time a company town in which most homes were owned by Inco rather than by private homeowners. In Sudbury, a $2 million relief fund was quickly set up by Sudbury City Council.
Despite the extent of the damage, however, many meteorologists initially resisted classifying the storm as a tornado, because although the pattern of damage was consistent with tornadic activity there were no confirmed reports of a visible funnel cloud. It was not until 1972 that the Canada Atmospheric Environment Service published a final report confirming that a tornado had indeed taken place.

Fabio Quagliarella

Fabio Quagliarella () (born 31 January 1983) is an Italian footballer who plays as a striker for Serie A club Juventus. He is renowned for his brilliant shot technique.
Club career.
Torino.
Quagliarella began his professional career at Torino, where he grew up in their youth sector. He made his Serie A debut for Torino against Piacenza on 14 May 2000 and later made four appearances in the following Serie A 2001-02 season.
In 2002 and 2003, he was sent on loan to lower division clubs Florentia Viola, at that time in Serie C2, and then Chieti. He returned to Torino in 2004, and scored seven goals in Serie B, plus one goal against Ascoli in the promotion playoff's first legs. However, financial problems forced Torino to stay in Serie B, which allowed Quagliarella to leave the club on a free transfer.
Udinese, Ascoli, Sampdoria.
Quagliarella signed with Udinese in summer 2005. However, Udinese immediately sold half of his registration rights to newly promoted Ascoli as part of a co-ownership deal. Quagliarella stayed at Ascoli for just one season, scoring just 3 times in 33 Serie A appearances, and his rights were bought back in full by Udinese in June 2006 for undisclosed fee.
On 7 July 2006 Udinese sold co-ownership of Quagliarella, along with Mirko Pieri, to Sampdoria in exchange for the transfer of Salvatore Foti. Quagliarella's half was tagged for €1.5 million and Pieri for €0.5 million, while Foti tagged for €2 million, made the deal not involve money. During the 2006–2007 season with the "blucerchiati", Quagliarella scored 13 goals in league play and earned attention worldwide due to the spectacular nature of many of his goals. His breakout season at Sampdoria led to a call-up to the Italian national team and numerous rumors of a high-profile transfer abroad.
Following his breakout 2006–07 season, Quagliarella was wanted by both Udinese and Sampdoria. The two clubs were unable to comes to terms on his co-ownership deal and went to a blind auction on 21 June 2007. In the auction, Sampdoria bid €6.5 million, but were outbid by Udinese who paid €7.15 million to reclaim full ownership of Quagliarella. That window also formed a 4-club 4-way swap, which Udinese acquired Quagliarella from the fund of selling Vincenzo Iaquinta (€11.3M); Sampdoria while acquired Andrea Caracciolo as replacement (€4.25M in co-ownership) and lastly Fabrizio Miccoli replaced Caracciolo at Palermo (€4.3M).
At Udinese, Quagliarella started the 2007–08 season slowly, scoring just once in the season's first 11 games. However, he soon found his footing at the club, forming a dangerous strike partnership with Antonio Di Natale and scoring a total of 12 goals in the 2007–08 season. This led to Quagliarella securing a place in the Italian squad for the Euro 2008 competition. Fabio continued his goal scoring at Udinese in the 2008–09 season, reaching 21 goals in all competitions, including 8 goals in the UEFA Cup where Udinese reached the quarter-finals.
Napoli.
On 1 June 2009, Quagliarella moved to his hometown club Napoli for a transfer fee of €18 million, where he signed a 5-year deal. At Napoli, he was partnered with Ezequiel Lavezzi and attacking midfielder Marek Hamšík, and managed to score 11 goals in Serie A to help Napoli qualify for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League with a 6th place finish in the league. He played his last match for Napoli in Europa League, in a 1–0 win over IF Elfsborg. He was an unused bench in the second leg, which Walter Mazzarri used new signing Edinson Cavani partnered with Lavezzi, who the former scored a brace to help the team qualify.
Juventus.
On 27 August 2010, Quagliarella signed for Juventus on loan for a fee of €4.5 million with the Bianconeri having the option to sign him permanently for €10.5m, paid over three years. Before the winter break, he was the team's top scorer with 9 league goals in 17 appearances. However, he was injured on 6 January 2011 (right knee anterior cruciate ligament), in the first match after the winter break, losing to Parma 1–4. He would miss the rest of season. He was unable to play for Juventus in the Europa League, as he had already appeared against IF Elfsborg for Napoli earlier in the competition.
On 22 June 2011 Quagliarella signed a three-year deal to stay with Juventus for €10.5 million which will keep him until 2014. On 1 April 2012, He scored his third goal of the season against his former club Napoli and refused to celebrate due to his Neapolitan roots. On 30 April 2012, Quagliarella signed a 12-month extension that will keep him until the summer of 2015.
On 22 September 2012, Quagliarella scored two goals in Serie A match against Chievo Verona. On 10 November 2012, Quagliarella scored his first hat-trick against Delfino Pescara 1936 in a match that Juventus won 6–1. In the Champions League, he scored his first goal in the 2-2 against Chelsea.
Quagliarella opened the scoring in the March 2013 Derby d'Italia game against Inter Milan with a curled shot from , and made the pass for Alessandro Matri's winner.
International career.
Quagliarella was played for "Azzurrini" from 2000–01 season to 2004–05 season. He made his debut for U17 team (equivalent to now Italy U18) on 5 September 2000 against Slovakia. In the next season he was the member of Italy U19 team at 2002 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualifying, the first edition since the name change. (Refer to the age of the participant at the final stage of the tournament instead of at the beginning of qualification.)
Following his impressive performances with Sampdoria in 2006–07, Quagliarella was called up to the "Azzurri" squad for a friendly against Romania in February. However, it was delayed by the match cancellation due to fan riots in Serie A that weekend.
Later he played for the "Azzurri" in March for a Euro 2008 qualifier against Scotland, and made his debut as a substitute, replacing Luca Toni in the final minutes. In Kaunas on 6 June 2007, on his first start for Italy, he scored his first two goals for them in a 2–0 win over Lithuania in a vital Euro 2008 qualifier. On 6 February, he scored Italy's third goal in their 3–1 triumph over Portugal in an international friendly in Zurich. In June 2010 he scored a header against Switzerland in Italy's final friendly before the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
He was included in the Italian Euro 2008 squad and the Italian 2010 World Cup squad. During the second half of the 3–2 defeat to Slovakia in a Group F game at South Africa World Cup 2010, he executed a beautiful 25-yard chip to bring the score to 3–2. Coach Marcello Lippi had only given him 45 minutes in one of Italy's most shameful world cup knockouts, in which Fabio managed to give teammate Antonio Di Natale a rebound goal, have a volley cleared off the line by Slovak defender Martin Škrtel, have an equalizing goal controversially ruled offside, and score the aforementioned wonder goal. This match was also incidentally his 21st cap for Italy, having scored 7 goals for them since making his national team debut back in 2007.

New York State Route 14A

New York State Route 14A (NY 14A) is a north–south state highway located in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States. It extends for from an interchange with NY 14 in the Schuyler County town of Reading to an intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and NY 5 west of the Ontario County city of Geneva. In between, the two-lane route serves Yates County and the village of Penn Yan, located at the northeastern tip of Keuka Lake. Outside of Penn Yan, NY 14A traverses rural, rolling terrain dominated by farmland.
The route runs parallel to and west of NY 14 for its entire route between the Watkins Glen and Geneva areas. During the 1920s, NY 14A was part of NY 14, which originally served Dundee and Penn Yan on its way from Watkins Glen to Geneva. NY 14 was moved onto its current routing alongside Seneca Lake as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, at which time the old inland alignment became NY 14A.
Route description.
NY 14A begins at an interchange with NY 14 at Gabriel's Junction, a hamlet north of Watkins Glen in the town of Reading. The route heads to the northeast, passing under the Norfolk Southern Railway's Corning Secondary as it runs up the side of a hill. After , the highway takes on a more northerly routing, passing by several farms as it proceeds through Reading Center and toward the Yates County line. In one short stretch north of Reading Center, the highway crosses into Yates County, reenters Schuyler County, and heads back into Yates County. While in Schuyler County for the second time, it meets with the northern terminus of NY 226.
Once it reenters Yates County, NY 14A runs due north across the town of Starkey to the village of Dundee, where it is known first as Main Street. Main Street becomes Water Street at the main intersection in Dundee, where it meets Union and Seneca Streets. At the north end of the village, it turns west on Millard Street at a junction near the Dundee Central School. NY 14A remains on Millard Street to the western village line, where it intersects Pre-Emption Road. This north–south highway marks the Preemption Line that divided the Iroquois lands of western New York awarded to New York from those awarded to Massachusetts by the Treaty of Hartford of 1786. Just west of Dundee, NY 14A meets with the eastern terminus of NY 230.
From here, the route turns north and runs along the farmland-covered ridge between Seneca and Keuka Lakes, which features a thriving Mennonite community. The highway passes through the town of Milo, serving the small hamlet of Second Milo and the Penn Yan Airport before descending the ridge into Penn Yan, a village at the northeast end of Keuka Lake. It follows Brown and Liberty Streets in the village, sharing the road with NY 54 between Lake and Elm Streets. At the Elm Street intersection, located in Penn Yan's central business district, NY 54A ends at NY 14A and NY 54—completing its alternate loop of the latter—while NY 54 leaves NY 14A to follow Elm Street out of the village. NY 14A continues on Liberty Street through the northern part of the village, where it meets the southern terminus of NY 364 at a junction adjacent to the Penn Yan Central School District's campus.
North of Penn Yan, NY 14A enters the town of Benton, where it heads due north past several farms on the hilltop north of Keuka Lake. It goes through the hamlet of Benton Center before quietly passing into the Ontario County town of Seneca. In the hamlet of Hall, located north of the county line, NY 14A turns northeast, at which point the due north–south highway becomes County Route 5. NY 14A continues in a general northeasterly direction as it winds its way toward the city of Geneva. Midway between Hall and Geneva, the route picks up NY 245 just before it crosses Wilson Creek, a small stream feeding into Seneca Lake. NY 14A and NY 245 continue northeastward across farmland into the town of Geneva, where both routes terminate at a junction with US 20 and NY 5 just west of the Geneva city limits in a commercialized area known as Lenox Park.
History.
In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 12, an unsigned legislative route extending from Horseheads to Lyons via Watkins Glen, Penn Yan, and Geneva. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route 12 became part of NY 14, which extended south to Elmira and north to Sodus Point. NY 14 was realigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to follow a new highway along Seneca Lake between Reading and Geneva. Its former routing via Penn Yan was redesignated as NY 14A. In Penn Yan, NY 14A once followed Main Street, located one block to the east of its current routing. The old route passes through the main downtown area and by the Yates County Fairgrounds. This alignment of NY 14A merged into the current route north of Penn Yan and used what is now Old Route 14A to reach modern NY 14A southeast of the village.

It was released by Columbia Records on September 21, 1991, in Japan only. This album is a follow-up to the fourth installment to the series, titled "Character Special", which was released in 1990. The album is made up of character songs from the "Dragon Ball" cast. It would go on the to peak at 76 on Oricon's Japanese album charts.
The album initially picks up where the other character special leaves off. Each song in a way, tells their own unique story. "Capsule Corp." is simply Bulma making random comments about whatever she's doing. "Ichido wa Kekkon Shitai Mambo" features Kuririn singing cheerfully about how much he desires to get married. "Vegeta-sama no Oryori Jigoku!!" marks the only character song in the series, but not the last, by Vegeta.

"Share 'reba Inochi no Izumi Waku-Waku!! 2" is the follow-up to "Share 'reba Inochi no Izumi Waku-Waku!!" which is both performed by the northern Kaio-sama. Once again he continues to tell jokes that he only finds funny. By the end of the song he has succumbed to a fit of laughter. "Kuchibue no Kimochi Piccolo-Hen" is a follow-up to "Kuchibue no Kimochi", Gohan's whistling tune from movie four which was made into a character song for Gohan in Hit 6. This version is done from Piccolo's point of view. As established in movie four, Piccolo is sensitive to the sound whistling due to his adept hearing. As a result, for most of the song he complains and begs for the whistler to stop until he gives up and rockets away. Prompting an unidentified person to appear and comment on the chirping birds. "I•ke•na•i Oo-La-La Magic" features Chi-Chi forcing Gohan to take part in a mother-son karaoke duet as his and Goku's adventures has made Chi-Chi feel left out. Her plan is to compete in the local karaoke circuit with Gohan.
Despite its focus being on character songs, the album also features an image song by "Pochi featuring Apple Pie" called "Omoide no Tenkaichi Budokai". Which recalls the previous budokais in which Goku participated. Also included, the incidental piece "Takkaraputo Popporunga Pupiritto Paro" from episode 75, "Nanatsu no Tama o Soroeshi Mono yo...

Greenough River

The Greenough River is a river in the Mid West region of Western Australia.
Course.
Greenough River has its headwaters near Woojalong Hills on the Yilgarn Plateau. It runs in a south-westerly direction through deep valleys for approximately , passing through the Waterloo Ranges before descending to the coastal plain. A few kilometres from the sea it is obstructed by dunes, and turns to the north-west, running along a dune swale parallel with the coast for about 35 km before finally discharging into the Indian Ocean at Cape Burney, about south of Geraldton, Western Australia.
The ten tributaries that contribute to the Greenough are Woojalong Brook, Woolbarka Brook, Bangemall Creek, Urawa River, Kolanadgy Gully, Nangerwalla Creek, Wooderarrung River, Wandin Creek, Kockatea Creek and Wicherina Brook.
The lower reaches of the Greenough are estuarine; how far upriver the estuary extends is not certain, but probably about 7 km to near Bootenal Springs. The river mouth is barred from the ocean by a sandbar that breaks only in periods of strong flow. Once open, it usually remains open for several months. The bar has now been reinforced with brushwood on the northern side, to force the bar to open only on the southern side, where the adjacent dune is more stable.
Evidence from wind gaps suggests that, thousands of years ago, the Greenough River turned to the north-west a few kilometres further from the coast than it does at present, at the present-day site of Walkaway. It then ran along the inside of a limestone ridge, following what is now the path of the Geraldton–Dongara railway line, to the vicinity of Rudds Gully. Both watercourses then flowed north to discharge into the Chapman River. Later, Rudds Gully cut its own path to the ocean, and the Greenough River discharged into it; and later still, the Greenough cut its own path through the limestone ridge at Walkaway, thus forming its own course.
The well-documented strong winds at Greenough have resulted in large mobile dune system both to the south and north of the Greenough River mouth. Both are gradually moving northwards, and it is estimated that the southern dune will reach the mouth of the Greenough around 2045, at which point the Greenough may well become even more prone to flooding, or be forced to change its course.
Hydrology.
The river is dry most of the time, but has a number of permanent pools such as Bootenal Spring. However the entire basin is prone to severe flooding which have periodically devastated local farming communities. The worst on record occurred in 1888: over was flooded; the water was over deep south of Greenough; four people were drowned and many financially ruined; and ultimately the town of Greenough was abandoned.
Other flood occurred in 1953 with the river being reported as past the width of the floods in 1883. An wall of water washed down the river then steadily rose until it was high, completely covering the bridge near Walkaway, Western Australia. The 1953 flood was the biggest in 30 years.
The river water is eutrophic and sediment-laden, and there is evidence that this has affected the ecology of the area, with migratory wading birds no longer visiting the flood-plain in numbers as large as previously.

The Bird That Drinks Blood

The Bird That Drinks Blood (Korean: 피를 마시는 새 "Peeru'l mashinuun saeh", abbreviated as 피마새 "Pimasae") is a series of Korean fantasy novels by Lee Yeongdo. Set in the same world of Lee's previous work "The Bird That Drinks Tears", the stories depict clashes between absolute power and free will with the backdrop of the Neo Arajit Empire (Korean: 신 아라짓 제국) that's ruled over by flying capital Skywhere (Korean: 하늘누리). The Empress Governheaven of the Empire secures the eternal empire against the Lekons and rebellious forces, but it is gradually revealed that behind the endless conflicts and confusion the Empress's ambitions and plots have played a major part as well. The story begins with four people; Jimen the Emperor Hunter and a one-eyed human girl Asil, whose dream of an independent nation of Lekons have been ruthlessly suppressed by the Empress, on whom they swore to wreak vengeance; the General-in-Chief Elsi who took the marches of a margrave who formed a faction to defy the Empress, and Jeong U, the margrave's daughter.
Korean press has compared Lee's the "Bird" series to J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth works, in the aspect that Lee constructed languages and created geography, vegetation, and history that pans several thousand years. "Moreover, unlike Tolkien who set the virtual history simply as a mythical battleground of good and evil, in Lee's world the moving history, politics, industries and cultural background are constructed in such great detail that this another world feels real and urgent, and sucks you in." The Korean overtones of the world was also acclaimed. The ancient language of Arajit is based on the Proto-Korean language. The undefeated general Elsi enjoys a game of baduk while other characters enjoy traditional Korean folk games such as Ssireum and Yut Nori, and Jeong U dresses in what is similar to Hanbok and wears a binyeo in her hair. The Empire's system of rank and office is modeled after that of Silla and Goryeo.
Serialization and publication.
Serialization.
As Lee's all multi-volume series, such as "Dragon Raja"(1998) and "The Bird That Drinks Tears,"(2002) "The Bird That Drinks Blood" was serialized on a serial forum of an online service provider, Hitel, "from the Christmas of 2003 to Christmas of 2004, exactly a year." It is the last of Lee's works to be on the forum before Hitel's closure in 2007. It is also his longest work to date. (August 2011)
Publication.
Golden Bough, an imprint of Minumsa Publishing Group, has been Lee's publisher since 1998, and also runs an online community site for the fans of Lee's works. After "The Bird That Drinks Blood" was completed, in January 2005 the publisher called for volunteer "reader editors" at the website, to come meet the author at the publisher's office where they could talk about their requests and ideas about how the book should be printed. "The Bird That Drinks Blood" was published in July 2005 in 8 hardcover volumes. Each volume's title is as follows:
Races.
The fictional world of "The Bird That Drinks Tears" is inhabited by four chosen people, four races with their own deity - humans, nagas, lekons and dokkebis.
Rumors and hopes for a Trilogy, or a Tetralogy.
After "The Bird That Drinks Tears" and "The Bird That Drinks Blood", some readers wonder and hope that Lee would write the Bird series as a full tetralogy, because of an old tale told by the legendary Kitalger Hunters in "The Bird That Drinks Tears":
<br>
<br>
One part of the tale about the other two birds are told in "The Bird That Drinks Blood":
<br><br>
<br>
Lee's fans voice their hopes online that Lee would at least write "The Bird That Drinks Poison," if "The Bird That Drinks Water" isn't dramatic enough for a fantasy title. When asked about this in interviews, Lee denies any plans for another sequel on his part, saying "I don't know anything for now. I have no plans."
In a 2008 interview, when asked "we understand that writing the "Bird" series has not been finished. Please let us know your future writing plans," Lee answered laughing: "there are lots of rumors[...] About this 'Bird' series too. I never declared that I would write a series, but before I knew it, the new quartet or new saga has become the ambition of this typer's life. Well. If a story that I want to type comes up I will type it, if not I won't type it. I don't have any ambitious plan going 'I will type before I die!'"

Cassowary (software)

Cassowary is an incremental constraint solving toolkit that efficiently solves systems of linear equalities and inequalities. Constraints may be either requirements or preferences. Client code specifies the constraints to be maintained, and the solver updates the constrained variables to have values that satisfy the constraints.
Cassowary was developed by Greg Badros and Alan Borning, and was optimized for user interface applications. Badros used Cassowary amongst others for implementing Constraint Cascading Style Sheets (CCSS), an extension to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CCSS adds support for layout constraints. These allow designers to describe the layout of a web page in a more flexible manner. Cassowary is used to solve these constraints and calculate the final layout.
Smalltalk, C++ and Java versions are available in the main distribution. Furthermore, there are bindings for GNU Guile, Python, and STk.
Other people have ported the solver to JavaScript, Squeak and the .NET framework (Cassowary.net).
Cassowary is used by Scwm, the Scheme Constraints Window Manager. As of 2011, Cassowary is being used as the layout engine for Mac OS X Lion.

Paxson Communications sold the station in August 1999 to Spanish Independent Broadcasting Network, who changed the programming to Spanish-language independent, rebroadcasting station KWHY-TV channel 22 of Los Angeles, California. The next year, needing to vacate the upper-700 MHz band (channels 60 - 69), the station applied for and was granted a permit to move to channel 53. The station was licensed in June 2002 as K53GF. Since then, the station has dropped the KWHY-TV rebroadcast and operates as an independent station, airing mostly movies and infomercials for local car dealers.
In May 2005, K53GF received a request to vacate channel 53 from Aloha Partners, who were winners of the FCC auction for the spectrum now occupied by channel 54. However, with the DTV conversion still in process, there were no suitable in-core channels to which K53GF could move their analog operations. Instead, they requested to operate as a low-power digital TV station (LPDTV) on channel 38 and the FCC granted a construction permit in October 2005 to build LPDTV station K38IZ-D. In the meantime, Aloha Partners has not launched its proposed service to Public Safety, and K53GF remained on the air on analog channel 53 until May 2010. Aloha Partners and its channel 54/59 spectrum were acquired on February 4, 2008 by AT&T Mobility.
On October 27, 2008, the station filed for special temporary authorization (STA) to continue broadcasting the analog signal until 2009. The station began digital operation under program test authority on October 30, 2008.
Programming.
K38IZ-D airs a mix of locally-produced shows, public domain movies and paid programming in Spanish. On 38.2 the station broadcasts the Tuff TV network under the brand "IZ Tuff", on 38.3 the station broadcasts classic 70's/80's music videos under the brand "IZ Videos" and on 38.4 the station broadcasts ZUUS Country under the brand "IZ ZCTN".
From February 2, 2009-January 21, 2012, the station broadcast public domain movies in English on 38.2 under the brand "IZ Classics", and on 38.4 the station broadcast religious programming and music videos under the brand "IZ Hope".

Child savers

The child-saving movement emerged in the United States during the nineteenth century and influenced the development of the juvenile justice system. Child-savers stressed the value of redemption and prevention through early identification of deviance and intervention in the form of education and training.
Humanitism and altruism were not the only motivating factors for the child-savers. There is suggestions that an additional and perhaps overriding aim was to expand control over poor and immigrant children.
The Child Savers were 20th Century Progressive era reformers whose intent was to mitigate the roots of child delinquency and change and also to change the treatment of juveniles under the justice system. These women reformers organized in 1909 to stem the tide of 10,000 young offenders who passed annually through the city's court system. The greatest accomplishment of the Child Savers was the creation of the first juvenile court which appeared in Cook County, Illinois in 1899. This court was founded on two principles both highly advocated by the Child Savers. These two principles were formed on the basis that “juveniles were not ready to be held accountable for their actions” and “that they were not fully developed and could rehabilitate easier than adults”. This issue of juvenile delinquency was a big issue between the 19th and the 20th centuries, therefore the contributions of the Child Savers, both good and bad are evident in their history. Also the establishment of juvenile courts in cities across the United States was one of the earliest social welfare reforms of the progressive Ear, and represented a major change in the way in which the law dealt with wayward children. The essence of the juvenile court idea, and of the juvenile court movement, is the recognition of the obligation of the great mother state to her neglected and erring children, and her obligation to deal with them as children and wards, rather than to class them as criminals and drive them by harsh measures into the ranks of vice and crime.
Results of the Child Savers.
The Child Savers received both positive and negative feedback from their activism. On the one hand they received high amounts of criticism for being too radical and on the other hand they were praised for their revolutionary efforts. Nonetheless, the Child Savers brought about a new realization of humanism throughout this time period. Within Hull House that Jane Addams formed went forth with a commanding reform movement, thus defying middle class standards of appropriate behavior for women. America responded to the terrible ills of juvenile delinquency largely because of Jane Addams push to change their social construction. The Juvenile Protective Association, the first juvenile court in the nation, and a Juvenile Psychopathic Clinic. By the twenties, the leading edge of child protection had shifted from the Youth Justice Court to welfare agencies, and the JPA moved with it and now located on the North Side, the JPA continues to serve as a vital center of social work and advocacy on behalf of child and family welfare in Chicago.
Positive Outcomes.
One of the biggest activists of the Child Savers was Jane Addams. She put forth many contributions from her work with the Child Savers including the first Hull House which was one of the first settlement houses as well as a woman’s sociological institution. Another contribution is the invention of the Juvenile Protective Association (JPA). This institution was also established by Jane Addams which functions as a social welfare agency. Thus the understanding gained by the Hull House residents in acting as probation officers further persuaded that the existing system as regards children was inadequate and inconsistent. Followed by Jane Addams, Elizabeth Clapp established Chicago Woman's Club, in 1876 as traditional materialists. She describes their efforts as volunteer matrons in the city jail and police stations and as volunteer probation officers or social workers in court, their creation of a jail school and a charitable boarding school for neglected children. Clapp's work is valuable for demonstrating the formative, if informal, role women have played in advocacy for children.
Negative Effects.
Although there were many positive outcomes to result from the Child Savers movement, there were also many misfortunes. Many scholars believe that the Child Savers promoted altruism and guidance but then others say: “the child savers should in no sense be considered libertarians or humanists" This is based on the research that the indiscriminate arrest, indeterminate sentencing, military drill, and hard labor were the concrete results of their reforms. Another Problem is that the Child Savers tried to promote liberating the ‘delinquent’ children from the capitalism movement that wished to stem the "militant" wave through a new political economy, which resulted in tighter supervision and control from adults. According to Anthony Platt, the child-saving movement came from the upper and middle classes who were instrumental in incorporating new methods of social control on a largely immigrant class—the immigrant class was seen as inferior to the typical Protestant white ethic that comprised most of America.

R. P. Weston

Robert Patrick Weston (1878 – 6 November 1936) was an English songwriter. He was born and died in London. Among other songs, he co-authored (with Bert Lee), "With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm", a macabre little ditty about the ghost of Anne Boleyn haunting the Tower of London, seeking revenge on Henry VIII for having her beheaded. 
Weston's real name was Robert Harris and he was born in Kingsbury Road, Islington, very close to Dalston Junction. His father ran a grocery shop and the family lived over it. Harris became a railway clerk (as listed in the 1911 census), but took up performing and song writing. At this time, he was living at 46 Hemmingford Road in Islington with his wife Maud. In 1915 in the offices of his music publisher, Francis Day and Hunter, he met his future collaborator Bert Lee and they spent the next twenty years working together on songs, monologues, musicals and films. Some of their most durable work arose out their collaboration with Stanley Holloway. They also worked with Gracie Fields and the Crazy Gang. This collaboration was conducted in Weston's house in Twickenham until his death in 1936. 
Towards the end of Robert's life, his son, Harris Weston (born Robert Edgar Harris) also collaborated with his father and Bert Lee and the three of them produced the song "Harmonica Dan" in 1936. After Robert's death, Harris continued the collaboration with Lee and produced "Knees Up Mother Brown" in 1938. Like his father, Harris had talent as an amateur artist and in December 1939 produced a painting showing a riotous party scene entitled "Knees Up Mother Brown". On the back of the painting Harris describes the scene as "The Costers' Party on the 100th Anniversary of Ma Brown". This indicates that this song must have been inspired by, or arose from, the costermonger community of London. Both Robert and Harris Weston drew inspiration from London's cockney culture for many of their songs, some of which were often sung in a cockney accent. These include Robert Weston's "What a Mouth" which was recorded as a pop song by Tommy Steele in 1960 and "I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am" (with Fred Murray), which became US pop chart number 1 for Herman's Hermits in the 1965. Robert Weston's paintings also reflect his London background and include a watercolour of Houndsditch Market painted in 1916.
After Robert Weston's death, the house was occupied by Weston's two daughters who lived there into old age, with Weston and Lee's papers sitting untouched and unlooked-at. Their present whereabouts are unknown though several items have appeared on eBay, including Weston and Lee's three-volume work-book, containing manuscript versions of many, if not all, their songs. It is now known that this item is in the hands of a collector of music hall memorabilia. Robert and Maud Weston both enjoyed sketching and painting on an amateur basis and a selection of their art work was auctioned with other family items in 2008.
The actor and singer Roy Hudd created a stage show based on the songs of Robert Weston and Bert Lee ("Just a Verse and a Chorus") and wrote the only authoritative article of any length about Weston and Lee in a now defunct periodical, "Theatrephile" (Volume 2 No. 6), in 1985. In the article, Hudd reproduced the only known photograph of Weston and Lee together. Roy Hudd also adapted the stage show into a series of shows for Radio 2 and directed by Jonathan James Moore. These are in the BBC Archive. A programme exploring their lives and work was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 16 June 2009, presented by Children's Laureate Michael Rosen, produced by Emma Williams. It was a Unique Production. An earlier radio programme about the partners entitled "The Perfect Partners" was broadcast on the BBC Light Programme in 1946. In describing the programme, the Radio Times of the period states that they "wrote more than three thousand songs, as well as countless sketches, adaptations and revues".
Weston also wrote "I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am" (with Fred Murray), "I've Got Rings On My Fingers" and "When Father Papered the Parlour" (both with Fred J. Barnes). In fact the collaboration with Barnes was especially fruitful. Besides these two songs, Weston and Barnes produced "Somebody Would Shout Out Shop", "Hush Here Comes the Dream Man" (parodied by First World War soldiers as 'Hush Here comes a Whizzbang' and sung in the Theatre Workshop production of "Oh, What a Lovely War!", 1963) and "Sister Suzie's Sewing Shirts For Soldiers" which was Al Jolson's first hit. It was stated in an email to Michael Rosen from Barnes's grandson, that Barnes wrote the lyrics to these songs. Then, in his early forties, Barnes volunteered for the army and was drowned when the troop ship RMS Aragon was torpedoed off Alexandria on 30 December 1917. He was buried in the military cemetery in Alexandria.
