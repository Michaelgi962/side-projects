Story.
Amudhan (Ajay) and Vendhan (Srijith) stay in a hostel even after their friends leave home for vacation. Amudhan wants to visit Poo madandhipuram a neighbouring village where his lover Poongavanam (Sanam) lives. One night when he crosses the corn field to reach her house, he comes across horrifying things. He runs for his life and reach hostel to narrate his friend Vendhan everything. They enquire villagers and find out that it was a beast Ambuli, a man-eating monster. The villagers too live in fear of Ambuli.
The duo takes it as a challenge and starts researching about Ambuli. They decide to decode the monster and put an end to all its menace. The plot gets thicker when they meet Sengodan (Parthiban), who lives alone in the field. Marudhan(Jagan) meanwhile convinces the villagers to fight the monster.
How the duo and the villagers accomplish the task forms the climax.
The film begins with a scene happening in a corn field in south India, where A British Forest Ranger who is in charge of the fields is being alerted by some strange noises coming form deep inside the fields. He sets out with his dog and searches for the source of this strange noise, then suddenly the dog is being dragged inside and brutally killed by an unknown beast creature. Then the ranger is also dragged inside and killed by the creature. Then the plot shifts to the 1970s where a college (sir arthur wellington college) farewell party is taking place. Two friends Amudhan and Vendhan (the son of the college watchman), decide to stay back in the college hostel and spend the vacation there. This is mainly because Amudhan's Girlfriend Poongavanm lives in the nearby village of poomanandhipuram, so that he can't miss her during this vacation. The only thing that lies between the college and the village is the same corn field (now protected by a big wall), that is believed to be the hunting ground of the strange creature, that the people now call Ambuli. Though some people called it a myth, many believed that ambuli did exist. One night, despite warnings from Vendhan, Amudhan decides to go through the corn field to reach poomanandhipuram to meet Poongavanam. He makes the first trip successfully, but while he returns, he hears the same strange noise and is been chased and thrown off his cycle by Ambuli (which is not yet shown on screen). Amudhan runs for life and reaches the college, where he meets Vendhan and narrates him what happened and says to him that Ambuli is real. Vendhan is little convinced by Amudhan's narration and they both decide to visit the corn field together that night to see what really is happening. They both travel the entire field and reach one corner and find a wood house (the place where the British ranger once lived), and they meet Sengodan there. Sengodan guards the fields but his looks cause a little bit of suspicion to the boys that he might be the ambuli. But Sengoden does not harm them and the boys fled the place.
The next day, they ask Vendhan's father (the longtime watchman of the college) about Ambuli and also they enquire about Sengodan. Vendhan's father is very much angered by the news that they both travelled alone at night in the corn fields and cries to them saying that Death awaits whoever enters the field at night, as there lives a ferocious creature called Ambuli, that has killed so many people in the past and is still hungry for human life. He says that Vendhan is the only person he has got and if something happens to him he can't live. So he humbly requests them not to go there again. But still accepts to say about Ambuli and Sengodan. "About some 40 years ago, on the day of Solar eclipse, a pregnant women who has no one except her elder child, walks into the village of poomanandhipuram but faints right under the sun (it was believed that one who comes out on a solar eclipse, will be affected badly by the radiation ). The villagers rescue her and she gives birth the very night. But the baby born was not exactly a human being. It was half human, half beast like a neanderthal. The beast baby bites the arm of the village doctor and it also attacks her mother fatally and escapes into the fields, and it has been till date killing humans. And Sengoden is none other than the elder brother of Ambuli and Sengoden is a murderer as he killed the founder of the college, and says that they are lucky not to be harmed by Sengoden". This is the story said by Vendhan's father to Vendhan and Amudhan.
Vendhan and Amudhan decide to collect more details about Ambuli and they visit many people in the village and enquire. They meet one of their seniors Marudhan, who is a practical youth who does not believe in Ambuli at all. But ironically, Marudhan's grandma is the village lady doctor, whose arm was bitten by ambuli at birth. They find a painting of ambuli from another senior, (who writes a journal in the previous edition of the college magazine, about the mass migration of people from the poomanandhipuram village into another place, due to the fear of Ambuli). With this painting as a proof, they try to make a complain in the police station, where the Head cop says, they need at least a photograph as a proof and not a painting. Vendhan and Amudhan accept the challenge and decides to visit the corn field to take a pic of Ambuli. But they are once again interrupted by Sengoden and they take a pic of him, thinking that he is Ambuli.
As things went ths way, one night, Marudhan gets very curious about Ambuli, and decides to investigate things on his own. Thus he secretly follows a villager, who takes a full grown goat with him, and ties it to a small boat and sends into the lake that lies ahead of the old temple caves (that are now abandoned by the people). Maruthan watches to boat shake and the goat is now gone. He understands that the villagers were paying sacrifice to ambuli to vent his anger. So the next day he decides to see what lies ahead of the lake. He goes in the same boat and enters the cave where he encounters the creature. Terrified, he runs for his life and escapes from that place. Now having started to believe in Ambuli, he enquires about it to his grandma. At the same time, Amudhan and Vendhan check for some details in the library about Ambuli. They enter the Founder's room (which was not opened at all in the recent past) and find an Important Clue on his table. The Clue leads them to a key that leads them to the secret Projector room, which also turns out to be the chemical lab that has been locked for years. They Find some Projector reels and start watching them, as at the same time Maruthan's Grandma narrates what actually happened to Ambuli's mother and why Ambuli was born like a beast.What follows is some terrible truth that entire shocks Amudhan, Vendhan and Maruthan.
The founder of the college (Sir Wellington), is basically a scientist, who worked with the British Army in the second world war. After retirement he begins the college in South India. His longtime goal is to successfully carry out and finish his project. That is to create humans who can live for 150 years healthily. He decides to use Sengodan's mother as his specimen and injects his chemicals into the womb. This starts having an impact on Ambuli. The scientist dopes her with strong sedatives so that she visits him often for checkup, so that he can carry out his test without any problem. As she reaches her pregnancy date, she is affected too much by the sedatives and starts walking to the scientist to get herself checked. That day turns out to be the Solar eclipse, and unfortunately she is affected by the radiation form the eclipse. This causes a big change in her womb and thus Ambuli is born, as a Beast. The Lady doctor who checked her pregnancy is terrified by the looks and behaviour of Ambuli and tells his mom to kill Ambuli right then. But she lets Ambuli escape and commits suicide. Angered by this, Sengoden kills the founder who is the reason for all this.Still the story continues
Now Having collected all details about Ambuli, Amudhan, Vendhan and Maruthan decide that there is no use hiding from ambuli and they must fight against it. Or else they all will die of fear. So the village people gather as a strong mass and set to hunt Ambuli, headed by Maruthan. at the same time, Amudhan and venthan, along with their girlfriends, meet sengodan. Sengodan promises that he will take them to ambuli's place. They visit the cave at night, and there comes a Tall, fierce looking ape like creature, which is finally shown to be ambuli. As Ambuli tries to attack vendhan, Sengodan fights it bravely. The villagers also rush to the place. Then suddenly the army comes there with tranqualisers (The army is alerted by the head cop, who is convinced by Amudhan and Vendhan that Ambuli does exist). After an Intense battle in the field between the army and Ambuli, Ambuli is Tranqualised with the help of sengoden. The army captures Ambuli and he is taken away in a secured box. The villagers finally thank Maruthan, Sengodan, Amudhan and Venthan for their heroics in capturing Ambuli and thus ending their long-time fear.
As the credits roll out, a final shot is shown which is to happen in Dehradun, Where the box in which Ambuli is being carried. The box slowly starts moving a little and it cracks suddenly. It is to be Understood that Ambuli escapes from the box and sets on his next hunt. The film ends with the line

Enamel hypocalcification

Some areas in Enamel are hypocalcified.they are Enamel spidles, Enamel tufts, Enamel lamellae.
Enamel Hypocalcification is a defect of tooth enamel in which normal amounts of enamel are produced
but are hypomineralized. In this defect the enamel is softer than normal.
Etiologic factors may occur locally, affecting only a
single tooth, or they may act systemically, affecting all
teeth in which enamel is being formed. Local trauma
or abscess formation can adversely affect the
ameloblasts overlying a developing crown, resulting
in enamel hypocalcification or hypoplasia. Affected
teeth may have areas of coronal discoloration, or they
may have actual pits and irregularities. This is most
commonly seen in permanent teeth in which the
overlying decididous tooth becomes abscessed or is
physically forced into the enamel organ of the permanent
tooth. The resulting hypoplastic or hypocalcified
permanent tooth is sometimes known as Turner's tooth.

As such, the Crișana subdialect is a member of the northern grouping of Romanian varieties, which also includes the Moldavian and the Banat subdialects, and shares with them a large number of characteristics, as opposed to the Wallachian subdialect.
As with all other subdialects of Romanian, the one of Crișana is distinguished primarily by its phonetic features and to a lesser degree by its morphological, syntactic, and lexical features. However, in the context of the more fragmented Transylvanian speech varieties, these characteristics are less distinct than those of other dialectal areas. As a consequence, in some classifications the Crișana subdialect is not individualized, such as those of Gustav Weigand, Alexandru Philippide, Iorgu Iordan and Emanuel Vasiliu. Other analyses, however, include the Crișana subdialect in their classifications of four or five subdialects (the fifth would be the even less distinct Maramureș subdialect); this view is supported particularly by more recent studies, such as those of Romulus Todoran, Emil Petrovici, and Ion Coteanu. This divergence is a matter of definition.
Geographic distribution.
The Crișana subdialect has its name from the historical region of Crișana, although the dialectal area and the historical region only partially overlap. More precisely, the subdialect is spoken in the following Romanian counties: Bihor, Sălaj, Satu Mare, Alba (north-western part), Cluj (western half), Arad (northern half, delimited by the Mureș river), Hunedoara (northern part), Maramureș (south-western part).
Subdivisions.
Several varieties can be further distinguished within the Crișana subdialect, specifically those of Bihor, Țara Moților, the area of the Someș River, and Țara Oașului.
Particularities.
Sample.
Crișana subdialect: 
Standard Romanian: "Atunci iar a ieșit și s-a uitat. Am ridicat mîna. Și domnul a zis: Așa cîine încă n-am văzut. Și-atunci cîinele a venit cu oile și s-a uitat la mine să vadă ce-i mai spun. Că el a știut că-i mai spun ceva."
English translation: "The it went out again and watched. I raised my hand. And the gentleman said: I've never seen a dog like this. And then the dog brought the sheep back and looked at me to see what else I was going to say. Because it knew I was going to say something again."

Henry Ibbot Field

Henry Ibbot Field (Bath, 6 December 1797 – Bath, 19 May 1848), was an English pianist.
Field was born at Bath on 6 December 1797, was the son of Thomas Field, for many years the organist at Bath Abbey, by his wife, Mary Harvey, who died 15 June 1815. The father died 21 December 1831. Henry was the eldest of a family of seven children. He was educated first at Holdstock's Academy, and afterwards at the Bath Grammar School. At a very early age he showed his aptitude for music. He was taught by his father, and afterwards by James Morris Coombs, the organist of Chippenham. In 1807, being then just ten years of age, he performed for the first time in public, in a duet with his father. On 15 June 1830 he played with Johann Hummel, in the latter's Grand Sonata, op. 92. He was a virtuoso performer, and known throughout his career as a musical instructor. He was popular in his native city, and generally known as 'Field of Bath'. 
Field was an acquaintance of Charles-Valentin Alkan, and played the premiere of the latter's 'Second Concerto da camera', which was dedicated to him, at Bath in 1834 during Alkan's first visit to England.
He was a good scholar in French, Italian, Spanish, and German. While working as teacher of music at Prior Park College, Field in 1835 was converted to Catholicism by the Rev. Dr. Gentili. He was formally received into that church by Bishop Baines during the winter of that year. He gave his last concert on 13 May 1848, in the Bath Assembly Rooms. Whilst playing Wallace's "Cracovienne" he was suddenly struck down by a paralytic seizure. He died on 19 May 1848, aged 50, at the house of his brother Frederick, the surgeon, in Northumberland Buildings.

Allen Edward Everitt

Allen Edward Everitt (1824 – 11 June 1882) was an English architectural artist and illustrator. He was a leading artist in the Birmingham area between 1850 and 1880, and his work is a valuable historical record of local buildings of that period.
Life and work.
Everitt was born in Birmingham, the son of Edward Everitt, an art dealer, and grandson of Allen Everitt, a well-known local artist and art teacher. His maternal grandfather was David Parkes, the Shropshire antiquarian. He showed an early talent for art and received lessons from David Cox, with whom he remained a friend. His specialty was drawing old buildings and their interiors. Taking Birmingham as a centre he made careful drawings of almost every spot in the Midlands of archaeological or historical interest. Between the ages of thirty and forty, he made painting tours of Belgium, France and Germany. After this, he devoted himself particularly to building interiors, his work being mainly carried out in watercolour.
In 1857, Everitt joined the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, becoming, in 1858, honorary secretary, a post he held until his death. He taught drawing for many years at the "Deaf and Dumb Institution" in Church Road, Edgbaston, of which he was also, virtually, the secretary. In 1870, the archaeological section of the Midlands Institute was formed, and Everitt was appointed one of its honorary secretaries. He contributed to its journal, "Transactions", with articles on "Aston Church", "Handsworth Church and its surroundings", "Archaeological researches ten miles around Birmingham", "Northfield Church", "Hampton-in-Arden", "Old houses in the Midlands" etc. He was also, for a time, a member of the general council of the Institute. In June 1880, he was appointed honorary curator of the municipal "Birmingham Free Art Gallery", the forerunner of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.
In 1854, Everitt completed an important series of drawings of Aston Hall, in Warwickshire, which were used to illustrate Davidson's "History of the holts of Aston, with a description of the family mansion" (see bibliography). He also illustrated J. B. Bunce's ""History of old St. Martin's"" (1875), the parish church of Birmingham.
In 1880, Everitt married Frances Hudson. He died on 11 June 1882, at Edgbaston, where he had lived most of his life, of "congestion of the lungs". His very large collection of sketches has proved to be an invaluable historical record of buildings in the Birmingham area, many of which no longer exist.

Marmara smilacisella

Marmara smilacisella is a moth of the Gracillariidae family. It is known from the United States (Kentucky and Ohio south to Florida and Texas).
The larvae feed on "Smilax glabra", "Smilax glauca" and "Smilax hispida". They mine the upper side of the leaves, making a silvery white narrow mine. There is a narrow central line of frass. The mines wind about over the leaf, crossing and recrossing and in smaller leaves involving almost the whole upper surface. At maturity, the larvae turn bright red, emerge from the mine, and, in a fold under the edge of the leaf, spin yellowish white coooons to pupate.

Cabinn Hotels

CABINN Hotels is a Danish-owned hotel chain with eight hotels in the five largest cities of Denmark: four in Copenhagen, one in Aarhus, one in Odense, one in Aalborg and one in Esbjerg. CABINN Hotels is owned by the entrepreneur Niels Fennet.
History.
CABINN Hotels was founded in 1990 by Niels Fennet, who got inspired by the practical cabins he and his family stayed in on an overseas tour from Denmark to Norway. He found that the cabin contained everything needed for a stay and the functionality made it possible to have it all in a little space. This concept he transferred to the hotel business. 
Rooms.
CABINN Hotels have four room categories to accommodate price levels. Economy is the cheapest and smallest room; Standard is the most common room and a little bigger. The two last categories, Commodore and Captains are the most expensive.
Hotels.
CABINN Express.
CABINN Express is the first hotel to be built in the CABINN chain in 1990 in Copenhagen. CABINN Express is the smallest of all the CABINNs with 86 rooms and 260 beds. It is located in Frederiksberg close to the city centre and Forum Metro station at Danasvej 32.
CABINN Scandinavia.
In 1992 Niels Fennet expanded with CABINN Scandinavia, bigger than CABINN Express with 201 rooms and 617 beds. It is located around the corner from the first hotel on Vodroffsvej 55 in Frederiksberg by the lakes.
CABINN Esbjerg.
CABINN Esbjerg is from 1994 and was the first outside Copenhagen. With this hotel, CABINN Hotels became not just local but national. The hotel has been expanded several times, latest in 2007, and now has a capacity of 320 beds in 150 rooms. It is located by the pedestrian street and the main railway station on Skolegade 14.
CABINN Aarhus.
CABINN Aarhus is from 2001 and is located at the square Store Torv next to the jugendstil theater designed by Danish architect Hack Kampmann and the big cathedral on Kannikegade 14. There are 192 rooms and 486 beds, and the breakfast buffet is on the top floor. In 2010, Fennet started on a project to rebuild the hotel and expand and the architect behind is the American architect Daniel Libeskind. The project is estimated to be finished in 2013.
CABINN City.
CABINN City is the fifth CABINN. It opened in 2004 and is the most centrally located in Copenhagen on Mitchellsgade 14, behind Tivoli Gardens. It is drawn by the Danish architects Hvidt & Mølgaard and is neighbour to the historical police head office drawn by the architect Hack Kampmann in 1920. It has 352 rooms and 1020 beds. 
CABINN Odense.
In 2007 Niels Fennet continued his national expansion with CABINN Odense in the biggest city on the island Fyn, Odense. It is located on Østre Stationsvej 7-9 next to the railway station and H.C. Andersen museum.
CABINN Metro.
CABINN Metro was realised in 2009, when the seventh Cabinn opened in Ørestad, Cabinn Metro. The architect Daniel Libeskind designed the hotel which has resulted in a very unusual building with a complex facade and raw walls on the inside. The hotel is one of the biggest in Scandinavia with 710 rooms and 1760 beds. The hotel is close to the Ørestad Station and Copenhagen Airport Kastrup Lufthavn on Arne Jacobsens Allé 2.
CABINN Aalborg.
Aalborg is the fourth-biggest city in Denmark and CABINN Aalborg opened there in 2010. It has 239 rooms and 630 beds.
The environment.
CABINN strives to limit the release of CO2 by using environmentally friendly cleaning companies, sorting at source of trash, non-smoking hotel etc. In the year 2010 CABINN Metro received the Green key from the municipal for their environmental policy.
Inventor of CABINN.
Niels Fennet was born in 1944 in a small city called Valby. His parents divorced when he was little, and he was raised by his mother in a large one-room-apartment on Vesterbro. His mother was a teacher and later became the principal of several elementary schools. Niels Fennet was her only child. 
He finished his studies as instrument mechanic, but since it was difficult to find a job in this area, he started his own consulting engineer company at age 24. He built schools, factories, theaters, shops and most successfully cinemas. In a book later written about Nordisk Film, the most prestigious Danish Film company, it was mentioned that he saved their business by rebuilding their cinema Palads in a more economic way. He rebuilt the cinema from one cinema to 22 small ones. 
By the end of the 1980s, Niels found that the engineering business didn't satisfy him. It was a problem for him, that his work placed him in the most difficult position between owners who hired him and creditors who invested money and the people who did the actual construction work - he built but never owned the buildings. With the vision of Hotel Cabinn, Niels realised his dream of continuing building and constructing but this time, it was all for himself - he would own the buildings and also run them. Niels Fennet met his wife when they were both teenagers and has stayed by her side ever since. Lise Fennet is responsible for the company's economy and the daily care of the hotels. Together they have three children, all girls. Niels Fennet also has talent for painting and playing music.

Renaissance (song)

"Renaissance" is the ninth overall single from British band M People and is the fourth and final single from their second album "Elegant Slumming" (1993). It was written by Mike Pickering and Paul Heard and produced by M People. It was released on 28 February 1994. The song peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart following their first win for Best British Dance Act at the 1994 BRIT Awards.
Background.
At the time of "Renaissance"'s release they were touring the second leg of their 15-date "Elegant Slumming" UK Tour and riding the height of their musical fortunes with their double platinum album. "How Can I Love You More (Mixes)", "One Night in Heaven", "Moving on Up" and "Don't Look Any Further" had already provided them with four consecutive singles and this became their fifth.
Composition.
The song features pounding italo-piano chords and is laden with synths alongside an insistent bassline and classic house beat. Lyrically, it is in total contrast to the angry "breaking free" sung in "Moving on Up" to looking forward to coming home to one glorious night when Heather promises to "make you scream aloud with joy" – but "there'll be no day there'll be no night".
Chart Performance.
Out of the nine M People previous single releases at that point, this single was only the second to chart and peak in its first week (the only other single to do so at that point was predecessor "Don't Look Any Further").
"Renaissance" entered the chart and peaked in its first week at number 5 with sales of 89,000 copies in its first week, but made a steady descent out of the chart within seven weeks. When "Renaissance" left the chart, it had sold in total 179,000 copies.
In the two weeks prior to "Renaissance"'s release, "Elegant Slumming" climbed back into the Top Ten at eight climbing to six once the song had been released, then rising further once again to peak at number four weeks later. For the second time, M People recorded simultaneous single and album Top 10s for two weeks, being at numbers 5 and 6, respectively and the at 6 and 5, respectively the week after in March 1994.
"Renaissance" was also used as the theme tune to the BBC2 show "The Living Soap" which helped the single sales.
Music Video.
The video was filmed in San Francisco in January 1994 while the band promoted the launch of the US version of the album on the Sony label. Directed by Award winning Director of Photography Jeff Baynes for 'Eye Eye Ltd'/'Tatooist International' Production companies; Heather, Mike, Paul and Shovell were filmed together during the choruses with Heather in the driving seat of a classic black convertible American Cadillac with her bandmates as passengers all singing along or in a variety of places such riding in a classic Jag with Heather in the driving seat around the bustling American streets, driving past trams, and along a freeway. Heather has since admitted that at the time she was not qualified to drive and kept turning the wheel in the wrong direction. Other notable landmarks seen include the Park Bowl and Xing seen on the road.
There are also some internal scenes in a studio with Heather dancing and singing to camera with her three bandmates dancing behind her. There are also close-ups on Paul's hands playing chords on the piano and Shovell's drumming.
Live Performances.
Since its release, M People have continued to perform this song as their show opener for all their tours to this day, and the refrain "I'm coming..." is what Heather sings off-stage before making her entrance to the instrumental.
Remixes.
Remixes of the single were provided by Roger S., Macready, Da Silva and John Digweed and M People themselves who also included the original Album mix of the single alongside the Radio Edit and Master Mix.
Airplay.
"Renaissance" was serviced to radio three weeks before physical release when "Don't Look Any Further" was still in the Airplay Top 30 from two months earlier. It entered the Top 50 at number 45 then moved up 26 places in its second week to number 19, finally peaking at number 6. The new instrumental, tighter verses and stronger structure plus its use as a theme tune of a popular BBC show, "The Living Soap", all propelled the song's success very quickly.
"Renaissance" has the distinction of being the only ever M People single to be written and recorded in just one day. This was partly because the band were under pressure from their record label, DeConstruction, to have finished and finalised the album by the end of the Summer 1993. Therefore, the tweaking of the track was essential to become a carefree dance single.

LOFT

The Large Observatory for X-ray Timing (LOFT) is a proposed ESA space mission slated to launch around 2022, and devoted to the study of neutron stars, black holes and other compact objects by means of their very rapid X-ray variability. 
The mission was submitted to the ESA Cosmic Vision M3 call for proposals, and was selected, together with other three missions, for an initial Assessment Phase.
LOFT is supported by a large international collaboration, led by researchers spread over most of the European countries, including Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, United Kingdom, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Czech Republic, Spain, and with contributions from Brazil, Canada, Israel, United States and Turkey. SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research acts as principal investigator.
Mission architecture.
The Large Observatory for X-ray Timing mission comprises two instruments.
The Large Area Detector (LAD) achieves an effective area of ~10 m2 (more than an order of magnitude larger than current spaceborne X-ray detectors, e.g. RXTE) in the 2-50 keV range, yet still fitting a conventional platform and small/medium-class launcher, thanks to the monolithic design of its large area Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD).
The Wide Field Monitor (WFM) is a coded mask X-ray monitor with a large field of view (observing about 50% of the sky available to the LAD at any time), and is also based on the Silicon Drift Detector technology. Its operating energy range is the same of the LAD, i.e. 2-50 keV. 
Objectives.
The main scientific objectives of LOFT are:
Besides these topics, LOFT will in general study the X-ray spectra and variability for a wide range of astrophysical sources, e.g. magnetars, active galactic nuclei, cataclysmic variables, X-ray transients and gamma-ray bursts.
The unique capabilities of LOFT, make this instruments certainly able to provide new breakthroughs in a wide range of Astrophysical research areas.

__NOTOC__
The Caproni Trento F.5 was a small Italian two-seat trainer designed by Stelio Frati and built by Aeroplane Caproni Trento. The F.5 was not ordered into production and only a prototype was built.
Design and development.
By the 1950s the Caproni company had collapsed and could not survive the post-war economic problems, one of the few group members to continue working was Aeroplane Caproni Trento based at Gardola in Trento. Originally involved with aircraft maintenance and support the company decided to design and build a small jet trainer in 1951. The F.5 aircraft was designed by Stelio Frati based on his earlier glider work, it was a low-wing all-wood monoplane with a retractable tricycle landing gear. The engine was a small Turbomeca Palas turbojet located in the fuselage, it had two inlet ducts, one either side of the fuselage and the jet efflux was below the rear fuselage. It had an enclosed cabin with tandem seating for an instructor and pupil and was fitted with a jettisonable canopies.
The F.5 made its maiden flight on 20 May 1952. It was the first jet aircraft developed in post-war Italy, although evaluated by the Italian Air Force it gained little interest and was not ordered into production.
Aircraft on display.
The prototype, registered "I-FACT", and only F.5 is on display at the Museo dell'Aeronautica Gianni Caproni in Trento.

Ori Gersht

Ori Gersht (born 1967) is an Israeli fine art photographer. He is a professor of photography at the University for the Creative Arts in Rochester, Kent, England.
Life and career.
Education and exhibitions.
Gersht graduated in Photography, Film and Video from University of Westminster, London and studied for an M.A. in Photography from the Royal College of Art, London.
Gersht has exhibited widely in museums and galleries since the early 1990s. He is represented by Angles Gallery in Los Angeles, CRG Gallery in New York, Mummery + Schnelle Gallery in London, and Noga Gallery in Tel Aviv. In 2012, Gersht's show "History Repeating" was mounted at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
Artistic style.
Gersht engages the themes of life, death, violence, and beauty. His photographs and films transcribe images of sites of historical significance—the Judean Desert, Sarajevo, Auschwitz, the Galicia region of Ukraine, the Lister Route in the Pyrenees (on which Walter Benjamin made his ill-fated exodus from Nazi-occupied France)—into ciphers of psychological disruption. Such scenes may not seem out of the ordinary unto themselves, but, through the artist’s focused attention and treatment they evoke the emotional resonance of what has transpired—most often, violence, and, more significantly, the ghosts of war’s most egregious detritus, its refugees.
Landscape.
Pervasive in Gersht’s work is the landscape, as a place, an idea, and an art historical trope. His films and photographs may be compared to paintings in their display—from their unhindered access (no Plexiglas separates their surfaces from the viewer) to the frames surrounding the monitors on which the films often play. Moreover, the vistas and horizons of, for instance, "Between Places" (1998–2000), "White Noise" (1999–2000), "The Clearing/Liquidation" (2005), and "Evaders" (2009), recall Romantic depictions of the sublime. They conjure precedents in both photography, such as the breathtaking vistas of Andreas Gursky and the landscapes of the American South by Sally Mann, and painting, by J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, and even Mark Rothko.
Still life.
In his still life series Gersht investigated the relationships between photography, technology and optical perception, at a pivotal moment in the history of photography where digital technology both threatens a crisis and promises a breakthrough. Research into the early history of the medium of photography is brought together with theoretical discourse, creating, still image and films that (literally) explode the genre of still life, the beautiful and destructive results captured using cutting-edge technology. In "Pomegranate", a film that references Juan Sanchez Cotan’s 17th-century still life and Harold Edgerton’s stroboscopic photography, a high velocity bullet flies across the frame in slow motion and obliterates a suspended pomegranate fruit, bursting it open and wheeling it slowly into the air like a smashed violated mouth spraying seeds. A peaceful image is transformed into bloodshed, and a dialogue is established between stillness and motion, peace and violence.
Gersht’s photographs and films provide a meditation on life, loss, destiny and chance. Allusions to the catastrophic violence of the French Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, the bombing of Hiroshima, and the suicide bombs that Gersht anticipated during his childhood in Israel can all be found in this work. As such, it reminds us of our past, present, and future, and, above all, the fragility of life itself.

Bourscheid Castle

Bourscheid Castle (, , ) is located near the village of Bourscheid in north-eastern Luxembourg. The medieval castle stands on a site with archeological evidence of structures dating back to Roman times. Standing majestically some 150 metres (490 ft) above the River Sûre, it is enclosed by a circular wall with 11 watchtowers.
History.
Although first mentioned in records from 1095, the castle appears to have been built around the year 1000 on earlier foundations. It was extended on several occasions: the outer wall dates from 1350, the Stolzembourg house from 1384 and the courtyard from 1477. Behind the gateway from the end of the 15th century, a ditch protected by four towers barred access to the upper and lower castles. The southern and eastern towers are from 1498 and the artillery bastions were built in the 16th century.
The extension of the upper part of the castle took place in the 15th century while the great fireplace and tall chimney were completed about a hundred years later. Schenk von Schmidtburg, who acquired the castle at the end of the 18th century, undertook some repair work but was unable to prevent further degradation. In the 19th century, after the chapel collapsed, there was talk of demolishing the building. However, in 1936 it became a listed site and in 1972, with the encouragement of an association called the Friends of the Castle of Bourscheid, the State acquired the building and undertook extensive repairs. As a result of restoration work, the castle is now fully accessible to visitors, but remains a predominately open-air ruin. An audio tour is available in Luxembourgish, German, French, Dutch, and English. Publication of the Bourscheid historical archives has provided details of the castle and its former inhabitants.
Visiting times.
The castle is open to visitors all the year round: 1 April to 15 October from 9.30 am to 6 pm and 16 October to 31 March from 11 am to 4 pm.

Parnasala of Santhigiri

Parnasala (literally, a hermitage; in Sanskrit ‘parnasala’ means sacred groom) is a monument in the shape of a full bloomed lotus in pure white marble, located at Santhigiri Ashram, 21 km from Kerala's capital Thiruvananthapuram. The monument serves as the final resting place for the body of Navajyothisree Karunakara Guru (1927–99), the founder of Santhigiri Ashram.
The Parnasala, which rises to a height of 91 ft., was dedicated to humanity by the President of India, Pratibha Devisingh Patil, on August 13, 2010. It was opened for public worship on September 12, 2010. As the Guru espoused an inclusive, experiential spiritual path which transcends religious and ethnic divides, the Parnasala is open to all people for prayers and contemplation.
A cynosure for spiritual aspirants and tourists, the monument daily attracts hundreds of visitors.
History and significance.
Navajyothisree Karunakara Guru was born on September 1, 1927, in a simple family in Chandiroor village in the Alappuzha district of Kerala. Named Karunakaran by his parents, he was a quiet, contemplative boy who his followers believe received mystical experiences since childhood. He left home at the age of 14 years to lead a monastic life. After serving in Varkala-based Sivagiri Mutt and its various institutions for 17 years, Guru, by then known as Karunakara Swami, moved to live permanently at Pothencode in 1968. The first form of the Guru’s ‘Parnasala’ (hermitage) was that of a thatched roof supported by four tapioca stems. In the 1970s, this simple structure was converted into a one-room tenement with a tiled roof. It was in these austere environs that Guru lived and daily met the people who thronged the simple hermitage looking for solutions to everyday problems, including chronic ailments, or in search of higher truths. After the Guru’s death on May 6, 1999, his followers interred his body in the Parnasala and raised it as a monument.
The foundation stone for the Lotus Parnasala was placed by Sishyapoojitha Amritha Jnana Thapaswini, the foremost disciple of Guru and his spiritual successor, on November 17, 1999. The construction work went on uninterrupted for ten years, backed by the unstinted prayers and support of the Guru’s disciples and followers in different parts of the world such as the late former President of India, Sri K. R. Narayanan and noted author, Sri O. V. Vijayan
A lamp lit by Guru when he established the Ashram, has been kept burning ever since and is placed inside the Parnasala, which symbolises the Guru’s life and message of universal peace, spirituality and fraternity propagated through a Guru-Disciple order.
Design and dimensions.
The Parnasala is not designed by a professional architect. Its shape and structure were conceived by the head of Santhigiri Ashram, Sishyapoojitha Amritha Jnana Thapaswini, in inner visions. Nearly 100,000 Sq. Ft. of the milky white marble was specially mined at Makrana in Rajasthan and transported to Santhigiri Ashram for the Parnasala. The world famous Makrana marble has been the stone of choice for use in renowned monuments such as the Taj Mahal. Black granite was specially mined in Chamrajnagar district in Karnataka for the Parnasala.
The Parnasala consists of 21 marble overlaid petals supported on 21 pillars. While 12 petals, signifying the 12 zodiac divisions, are located in the upper layer, nine petals, signifying the 9 planets, unfurl in the lower layer. Similarly, there are nine inner and 12 outer pillars. There is a passage for the movement of devotees between the inner and outer pillars.
At the heart of the Parnasala is a cubicle in the shape of a lotus bud, which is carved out of teak wood and has the inner walls encased in brass plates. The Guru’s sacred body has been placed in a marble casket inside this wooden sanctum. A life-size image of Guru, sculpted in gold, has been placed in the sanctum atop a platform made of black granite. Eleven steps, also made of black granite, lead to the platform.
The Parnasala rises to a height of 91 ft. and is 84 ft wide. The inner circle has a width of 64 ft. The 12 upward petals measure 41 ft. each while the 9 downward petals measure 31 ft. The teak wood sanctum has a height of 27 feet and 21 ft. diameter. A parasol with a diameter of 36 ft. shades over the sanctum. In front of the sanctum is a ceremonial platform with intricate wooden carvings and artwork.
Dedication and opening ceremonies.
The Lotus Parnasala was formally dedicated to humanity by the President of India, Pratibha Devisingh Patil, at a special function at Santhigiri Ashram on August 13, 2010. Kerala's Governor, Sri R. S. Gavai, presided over the function, which was also attended by Kerala's Home Minister, Sri Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor.
Speaking on the occasion, the President described Navajyothisree Karunakara Guru as a great visionary who believed in a casteless society based on strong family values.

<doc id="31141534" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31141534" title="Income inequality in China">
Income inequality in China

Despite China’s formerly communist economic system, China’s current market economy features a high degree of income inequality. According to the Asian Development Bank Institute, “before China implemented reform and open-door policies in 1978, its income distribution pattern was characterized as egalitarianism in all aspects.” At this time, the Gini coefficient for rural – urban inequality was only 0.16. As of 2012, the official Gini coefficient in China was 0.474, although that number has been disputed by scholars who “suggest China’s inequality is actually far greater.”
History.
In a landmark paper published in the Review of Development Economics, economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiaobo Zhang conclude that there have been three peaks of inequality in China in the last fifty years, “coinciding with the Great Famine of the late 1950s, the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s, and finally the period of openness and global integration in the late 1990s.” Their research indicates that these periods of inequality are driven by “three key policy variables – the ratio of heavy industry to gross output value, the degree of decentralization, and the degree of openness.” The study finds that the “heavy-industry development strategy played a key role in forming the enormous rural-urban gap in the pre-reform period, while openness and decentralization contributed to the rapid increase in inland-coastal disparity in the reform period of the 1980s and 90s.” In other words, heavy industry development in the cities formed the initial rural-urban gap leading up to the reform period, and decentralization increased overall inequality, rural-urban inequality, and inland-coastal inequality as the economy opened up after the 1978 economic reforms. Research conducted by Jeffrey Sachs on the entire period from 1952 to 1996 indicates that in general, regional income inequalities are driven by government policy, whereas income convergence is "strongly associated with the extent of marketization and openness."
Current State.
China is an emerging economy, with quarterly GDP growth rates averaging 9.31% for the past two decades, powered mainly by strong exports. However, despite being the largest exporter for world’s demands, China still faces a number of development challenges and one of the most pressing socioeconomic issues is the increasing income disparity between different groups of citizens, largely characterized by rural-urban income inequality. Despite steady growth of China’s economy since economic reforms in 1978, the rural urban income gap reached its widest in more than three decades in 2009. According to data from National Bureau of Statistics of China, at its widest disparity, city dwellers were earning 3.33 times as much as farmers (income ratio of 3.33:1), with per capita disposable income of urban households standing at RMB17175 while per capita net income of rural households at RMB5153. In contrast, the income disparity was at its narrowest in 1983, at 1.82:1, due to effects of the Household-responsibility system introduced in 1978. As of year 2010, income ratio was recorded at 3.23:1 and per capita disposable income of urban households stood at RMB19109 while rural households’ were at RMB5919.
Factors.
Urban-Biased Policies.
In China, rural-urban income differentials “constitute a large share of total inequality, and the widening sectoral gaps in recent years have caused the rising inequality in China.” Research conducted by Dennis Tao Yang published in the journal of the American Economic Association indicates that the root of China’s rural-urban divide “lies in the strategy of the centrally planned system that favored heavy-industry development and extracted agricultural surplus largely for urban capital accumulation and urban-based subsidies.” In the 1980s and 1990s, state investments in the rural economy accounted for “less than 10 percent of the budget, despite the fact that the rural population was about 73-76 percent of the national population.” Additionally, factor market distortions have created significant rural-urban inequalities. More specifically, research published in the Journal of Economic Modelling demonstrates that the Hukou system and absence of a fully functioning land market are two main drivers of rural-urban inequaltiy.
Inland-Coastal Inequality.
As is well documented in many studies, rural-urban inequality is a major contributing factor to general income inequality in China. However, “while the contribution of rural-urban inequality is much higher than that of inland-coastal inequality in terms of levels, the trend is very different. The rural-urban contribution has not changed very much over time, but the inland-coastal contribution has increased by several fold,” meaning that inland-coastal inequality is playing an increasingly important role in the formation of general income inequality across China. Research on economic growth after the opening of the Chinese economy has shown that between 1989 and 2004, income in coastal provinces more than tripled whilst that in inland provinces doubled. Research on inland-coastal inequality indicates that "since being a coastal province is a geographic advantage that will persist, this tendency for divergence will also probably continue," but institutional factors still have a significant effect. Economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiao Zhang propose that the “greater ease of rural-to-urban migration within provinces, compared to the institutional and other difficulties of migrating from inland to coastal provinces” can partially explain this phenomenon.
Education.
According to research conducted at the World Bank, “inequality of access to education is an important source of inequality in China across people contemporaneously and across generations.” In fact, “a decomposition analysis based on household income determination shows that the largest proportion of changes in total income can be attributed to the increase in returns to education.” Urban-biased policies and inland-coastal inequality exacerbates the issue of education inequality in China. One of the primary issues is their generation of sector-biased income transfers and expenditures on health, housing and education, which "not only distort economic incentives of the workers in teh sectors, but will also affect the human-capital attainments of their children, which may further widen the rural-urban income gap." In other words, inland and rural inequality can help create a vicious cycle by funneling money towards the coastal cities and away from investments in human capital elsewhere. Like in the United States, education funding is primarily the responsibility of local governments in China. As poor localities are less able to fund these services and poor households are less able to afford the high private cost of basic education, China has seen an increase in the inequality of education outcomes. “For example, in 1998, per pupil expenditure in Beijing was 12 times that in Guizhou, and the difference jumped to 15 times in 2001.”
Demographic Change.
According to research published in the China Economic Review, population aging is “largely responsible for the sharp increase in income inequality in rural China,” especially at the beginning of the 2000’s. As a result of Chinese governmental attempts to control population growth with the one-child policy implemented in 1979, many fewer young adults have reached the working age over the course of the past decade, leading to a significant “fall in the ratio of household members of working age.” This created a labor shortage, which in combination with the rapid expansion of industrialization served to increase income inequality. Beyond income inequality, this research also indicates that “an imbalanced population structure will influence the social and economic development in many other respects.” The researchers recommend serious reconsideration of the one-child policy to mitigate these effects.
Impact.
In December 2009, a survey conducted by the "Economy and Nation Weekly" magazine of Xinhua news revealed that 34 out of the 50 leading Chinese economists surveyed think of income inequality as a challenge to China’s sustainable development. Economist Kenneth Rogoff also cautioned on the problem of income inequality, commenting that “There is no doubt that income inequality is the single biggest threat to social stability around the world, whether it is in the United States, the European periphery, or China.” Income inequality is argued to be a menace to social stability, and potentially causes a disappearance of middle class capital that would impede China’s economic growth.
“Hu Angang, an influential researcher in China, warned that further increases in regional disparities may lead to China’s dissolution, like in the former Yugoslavia,” while other scholars have noted that “further expansions of the differences may create serious social and political problems, generate nationalist conflicts and negatively influence China’s economic and social stability.”
“The current institutions and policies are detrimental to China’s future growth because the sector-biased income transfers and expenditures on health, housing, and education not only distort economic incentives of the workers in the sectors, but will also affect the human-capital attainments of their children, which may further widen the rural-urban income gap.” In other words, current income inequality created largely as a result of government policy favoring urban centers begets further rural-urban income inequality, which creates a vicious cycle and further reinforces regional and rural-urban inequalities.
Policy Recommendations.
Economic Reform.
 Research published by the International Monetary Fund indicates that “continuing with the current growth pattern would further increase already high investment and saving needs to unsustainable levels, lower urban employment growth, and widen the rural-urban income gap.” Instead, they recommend reducing subsidies to industry and investment, encouraging the development of the services industry, and reducing barriers to labor mobility, believing that this would result in a “more balanced growth with an investment-to-GDP ratio that is consistent with medium-term saving trends, faster growth in urban employment, and a substantial reduction in in the income gap between rural and urban residents.”
 With regard to labor mobility reform, research published in the journal of Economic Modelling suggests that reforms in the rural land rental market and Hukou system alongside efforts to increase off-farm labor mobility would dramatically reduce the urban-rural income ratio. Additionally, the research states that “the combination of WTO accession and factor market reforms improves both efficiency and equality significantly.” WTO accession means that the economy will become more liberalized and open, “likely resulting in dramatic shifts in regional comparative advantages.” This regional disparity will likely be exacerbated by continued government investment in coastal regions, so “further liberalizing and investing in the economy in the inland region is thus an important developmental strategy for the government to both promote economic growth and reduce regional inequality.”
Social Policy Reform.
Analysis of the impact of the one-child policy indicates that “population aging will impact society in multiple ways, and it is therefore crucial for policy makers to produce a development strategy that tackles the socio-economic challenges of an aging population.” Some specific recommendations from the School of Public Finance and Public Policy of Beijing include “the establishment of a basic old age security system in rural areas” to reduce income inequality, encouragement of development of local industry in less affluent regions, subsidization of children’s education in lower income households, and the establishment of public health insurance plans for the poor.” Additionally, the report finds that “In the long run, the Chinese government should reconsider whether the one-child policy should be continued. As an interim policy, it has achieved its objective, and now is the time for adjusting the policy.”
 Research from the World Bank indicates that while inequality of income can be inevitable at certain stages of development, inequality of opportunity will undermine long-term development prospects. In order to enhance growth and fight poverty, it will therefore be important to improve access to basic education, especially in poor rural areas.

Rugby League Conference Welsh Championship

The Rugby League Conference Welsh Championship was the lower of two Welsh domestic leagues for the sport of rugby league. It was a division of the Rugby League Conference competition which covers all of Great Britain.
History.
The Rugby League Conference was founded in 1997 as the "Southern Conference", a 10-team pilot league for teams in the South of England and English Midlands. It expanded into Wales for the first time in 2001 when Cardiff Demons joined the South West division.
After two years of just one club in South Wales, the RFL saw that it was time to expand, letting in six more open-aged sides to form the new Welsh Conference and Wales gained its own division for the first time.
The Premier Division were set up in 2005 for teams who had achieved a certain playing standard and where able to travel further afield to find stronger opposition. The new Premier Divisions included the North Premier, the South Premier, the Central Premier and the Welsh Premier.
The Welsh Premier division was split into two divisions East Wales and West Wales in 2006, though this decision was reversed for the following season.
The Welsh Conference Junior League began in 2009.
Due to the growth of the sport in Wales, in 2010 a separate Championship division was formed which would function at one tier lower than the present Premier division. This Championship division featured teams from South Wales, but another Championship division featuring teams from North Wales was meant to be contested, but it didn't materialise and a rugby league nines tournament was played instead.
The South Wales Rugby League Championship was given a re-structure following four West Wales clubs not fulfilling fixtures. Amman Valley Rhinos, Dinefwr Sharks, Swansea/Llanelli Dragons and West Wales Wild Boars were omitted and replaced with newly formed Dyffryn Devils. The league was scrapped after the 2011 season.
2011.
Teams.
Teams play each other on a home-and-away basis.
Junior league.
Welsh teams also compete at under-17; under-15 and under-13 age groups.

Ilaveezha Poonchira

Ilaveezha Poonchira is a tourist destination located in melukavu village in
Kottayam district near Kanjar. Ilaveezha Poonchira is surrounded by three enchanting hillocks - Mankunnu, Kodayathoormala and Thonippara. This makes the place ideal for trekking.
Origin.
"Ila-veezhaa-poonchira", means 'the pond of flowers where the leaves do not fall'. During the monsoons, the valley between a complex of mountains fills up to form a large pond.
According to a legend, the Pandava had a sojourn here during their life incognito. Their wife, Draupadi, came to take a bath at a lake, which was present at that time. Some devas, bewitched by her beauty, tried to satisfy their voyeuristic itch. King of devas, Lord Indra, came to know about what was going on, and built screens or hills heaping flowers and prevented them from indulging in such a practice. And the pond thus became a dam isolated by floral hills. Since there were no trees around the bund, it was always free of leaves and so it was called Ila-veezha-poonchira. Some say that the name comes from the fact that it is always windy at the place and hence the leaves are carried away. 
poonjira's myth is closely related to Agastya and his hermitage,he lived here and the native people believes that he still lives here,his hermitage is hidden in somewhere here.In puranas and our myths there is no evidence for the death of GURU AGASTHYA.Another important attraction is the ancient krishna temple, that was founded by panjaly herself.the mass belief is that panjaly's akshayapatra is hidden here and it is protected by agastya.The myth is also associate with ramayana his vanavasa popularly believes that he lived here with lakshmana for few months

Part of a new four-lane highway ringing Tokyo, construction began in 2002 and was scheduled for completion in 2011, but the opening to traffic was delayed until 2012. With the provisional name of the public was asked for suggestions. From the 12,223 received, "Tokyo Gate Bridge" was chosen and officially announced on 15 November 2010.
Design.
The rather unusual design is a result of opposing requirements: to be high enough to allow large ships to pass underneath, but low enough not to interfere with air traffic to the nearby Haneda Airport.　It is a double cantilever bridge, which means that the truss sections from either side can be completed in balance, and then joined by addition of the relatively short central span. In effect, this bridge is a somewhat gawky deformation of a single span of the iconic Forth Bridge in Scotland. A more fanciful view, of the two sides being monsters facing off, has given it the nickname of

Suchtweetsorrow

Suchtweetsorrow is a modern-day adaptation of Shakespeare’s Romeo & Juliet in tweets.
During the period of five weeks (April 10, 2010 – May 12, 2010) six professional actors performed the play on Twitter and other web devices. The actors improvised around a prepared story grid and could interact with each other and react to followers, fans, real events and comments via Twitter. The play was a cooperation between the Royal Shakespeare Company and The Mudlark Production Company.
Plot.
The story of Romeo and Juliet's love is taken to the 21st century and is set in an unknown town in Great Britain. The feud between the Montagues and the Capulets begins with a tragic car accident in 2000 where Susan Capulet, Juliet's mother, dies. The driver, Montague Sr, survives with heavy injuries. Mr Capulet, a successful property developer, was left with three children: Jess, Tybalt and Juliet. He remarried in 2002. Montague Sr, a landscape painter, still lives in the area with his wife and son.
Ten years later, Juliet is the only child still living at home. Her older sister Jess, whose nickname 'Nurse' comes from nursing her younger siblings, lives and works as a trainee solicitor in a nearby town. Their brother Tybalt lives two hours away in a public school. He has been sent to boarding school at the age of 7 and has never settled in any of them ever since. Jess as the oldest tries to keep the family together and has close contact to her father and sister and does her best to communicate with her brother, too.
First week.
The story starts with Mr Capulet deciding to take his family to Australia for good. In the meantime, Jess, who is getting in shape for the London Marathon, convinced Juliet to join the online platform Twitter. On the other side of the town Mercutio, Romeo's best friend wakes up with a hangover and a missing mobile and tweets away the events of the night. As the 10th anniversary of the accident is nearing everybody is reminded and thinks about the events in the past in a different way. Juliet remembers her mother but is also thinking about her birthday coming up. Jess begins to feel depressed about their mother's death and feels that Montague Sr. should have been prosecuted for murder. Mercutio remembers the big fight where Montague Sr. was beat up by 'Crapulet'/Mr.Capulet and announces his hate on Twitter. He was too young to have known about the real events going on but he has grown so close to the Montagues that he knows on which side he belongs to. Romeo has not been convinced to join Twitter yet.
On the anniversary of Mrs Capulet's death the yearly mourning is disrupted by Tybalt getting expelled from school because of drug-dealing. Mercutio is announcing this day Montague Day as he thinks they should stand proud. As a result Montague Sr told him to keep his Twitter profile on the low. So he is tweeting about a girl he scored last night instead.
In the meantime, Laurence Friar, the local coffee shop owner, is tweeting inspirational messages and memories about Mrs Capulet.
Tybalt's expulsion casts dark shadows over the family and ends with his father deciding that he won't be coming with them to Australia. Laurence Friar finds out about the family troubles of the Capulets and offers his help and his memories of their mother to all three children. Jess accepts his offer and visits him but his memories does not quite match up with her own especially Laurence's version of her mother's friendship to Montague Sr. Meanwhile, Juliet returns home very upset as somebody has written "MONTAGUE IS INNOCENT" on her PE shirt. Romeo has been persuaded to join and is supported by Laurence who also visits the Capulets at their house to network and bond with Tybalt and his father.
The next day Juliet returns from school in a happy mood, her friends have made CAPULET AND PROUD T-shirts and for that she tweets about her upcoming birthday party: Proud to be a Capulet – dying to be 16. Mercutio and Romeo are hanging out at Laurence's coffee shop with Montague Sr. as Tybalt arrives. Laurence can prevent them from fighting but the situation between the families is more tensed than ever. Mr. Capulet has a talk with Tybalt about his future and proposes that he could start working in the property business and look after himself when the others move to Australia. Tybalt is liking the idea of sorting himself out.
The next evening Mercutio gets into a funny tweet-flirt with an older woman, Jess, in a local pub after having visited a football match and making a fool out of himself, ranting in front of a TV camera. Laurence Friar also visited the football match, sponsoring a young player and calming down Tybalt, who has watched Mercutio on the screen. Later that night Romeo knocked Tybalt out with his first punch and Jess broke it up before it got worse.
Second week.
As a result of yesterday's fight Romeo got grounded while Tybalt gets praised for fighting a Montague. Jess is helping her stepmother to sell her health products and discovers a painting of Montague showing her mother. At the same time Romeo listens to his father talking about love and he asks himself and his followers on Twitter: what is love? Juliet's followers discover that she writes her own songs and demand lyrics and uploads of her singing.
While being grounded Romeo spends the day playing Xbox and chatting with a female player named Rosaline on Xboxlive. Mercutio is starting a #freeromeo campaign on Twitter, Juliet is thinking about a theme for her birthday party and Laurence Friar is taking his time to plan his table tennis tournament.
Juliet has finally found a theme for her birthday party, a masked ball, and tweets away the news while Romeo still spends the day at home and develops feelings for the female player Rosaline. He confides with Mercutio later that day and finds him repelled by Romeo's use of the word 'relationship'.
Mercutio is still working on the #freeromeo campaign while romeo is getting more and more stressed out at home. Rosaline has abandoned him and is never to return. Tybalt spends the day at Laurence's smoking pot. Juliet's masked ball is in the making and Jess finds herself left alone with the task of organizing it. Juliet posts an open invitation on Facebook.
The day before the party: everybody is excited especially Juliet and Jess, who had asked Laurence to keep the party a drug-free zone. Romeo is still depressed about Rosaline ditching him and is cheered up by Mercutio who is planning to crash Juliet's party. Tybalt, who is suspecting them to crash, is posting threats for them on Twitter.
At Juliet's party, Tybalt and Laurence are useless as bouncers so crashers are inevitable. Mercutio and Romeo are having fun crashing and Romeo spots a cute girl in a pink mask. Juliet's date for the night gets off with another girl but she sees a boy in funny mask. Jess sees Romeo and Juliet snogging later that night. The party ends with Juliet going upstairs to her room and waiting for Romeo. After a few moments hesitating he runs upstairs.
Jess wakes up the next day with the house looking like a bomb-site and discovering Juliet in bed with Romeo. After advising her to get her lover out of the house before Tybalt wakes up she rushes off to the London marathon. Tybalt drags himself down to London to support his sister after having a quick look on Romeos tweets about a little girl he spent the night with. Mercutio discovers a change while hanging out with Romeo as he is not interested in fooling around as usually. After tweeting anonymously about last night Romeo and Juliet set up a date for the next morning and Juliet, still not knowing who Romeo truly is, goes to London to support Jess.
Third week.
Jess finishes the marathon successfully and is supported by Tybalt and Laurence but not even congratulated by Juliet who spends the day at the house with her new lover. Romeo still hasn't told her that he is a Montague. Tybalt found out that Juliet lost her virginity on her birthday but still has not connected that to Romeo's romantic tweets yet.
The next day the pieces are slowly fitting together. Tybalt discovers that Romeo is flirting with his little sister and Mercutio begins to realize that he is losing Romeo to his new love. Laurence also discovers the new romance and approves thinking this would encourage the healing process between the two families. Jess, who was unaware of Juliet not knowing Romeo's identity, reveals the secret to Juliet. Romeo trying to confess discovers that she already knows and spends the evening apologizing and explaining. Juliet, astonished about the news, needs time to think.
Tybalt spends the next day with his father who is getting ready for Australia. He decides to put Tybalt in charge of the family interests in the UK with Laurence as mentor. Tybalt is thrilled and is also pleased that Juliet has stopped communicating with Romeo. Romeo spends the day with his family too, having a deep talk about love with his father. By the end of the day he thinks about letting Juliet go. Mercutio also gets in touch with his family, who sent him a very formal email. His wish to be a true Montague deepens and he tries to confide with Romeo only discovering that he had blocked him on Twitter.
Jess and Laurence arrange a meeting between the two lovers, Romeo and Juliet, in order for them to sort things out. After having spent a whole day offline and thinking, Juliet has discovered that her feeling for Romeo are stronger than she thought. Laurence also gets Tybalt to help him out with the tournament but also discovers Mercutio and him fighting all over Twitter. Tybalt is teasing Mercutio about Romeo abandoning his best friend. Mercutio is getting more and more frustrated about it. Juliet and Romeo spend a long time alone in Laurence's apartment.
Laurence's ping-pong tournament takes place with Tybalt winning all the way only getting defeated by Mercutio in the finals. His victory does not improve Mercutio's mood though. Romeo and Juliet spend the day with sexual adventures. Tybalt discovers that Juliet has blocked him on Twitter.
Juliet persuades Laurence to build a love shack for her and Romeo. Although Jess thinks this romance is moving too fast Laurence agrees. Juliet surprises Romeo with the den and they discover the Laurence is qualified to perform humanist weddings. They arrange a mock wedding on Twitter where Jess ignores the request to perform as a witness.
Mercutio discovers that somebody has hacked his Twitter account and even apologized to Tybalt who on the other hand does not even notice because he is angry about last nights result and the quality of dope Laurence has given him. He confronts Laurence only to be surprised by Jess who wanted to confide with Laurence about the last events. She finds him giving drugs to Tybalt instead and is outrageous. The Montague side of the events ten years ago are uncovered also revealing that Mrs. Capulet was in love with Montague Sr.. Romeo and Juliet sneak off to a hotel that night without telling anybody.
Fourth week.
Juliet tells Jess that she is not moving to Australia and also married Romeo at the registry office yesterday – no joke. Laurence tells Tybalt that Romeo and Juliet have been meeting up at the coffee shop and Mercutio finds out about Juliet being Romeo's mystery girl. As a result Tybalt is out for Romeo's blood and Mercutio wants to beat up some Capulets at the night's football game. Romeo tries to calm everybody down, he wants no fight at all.
Everybody goes to the football match and Jess loses track of Tybalt after having been separated due to crowd troubles. Romeo gets lost too. Nobody knows what's going on. Mercutio finally shows up in an ambulance and later at the hospital. After joking around he curses all the Capulets and Montagues and dies.
The next day Romeo is laying low and tweets Mercutio with no reply. He also tweets Juliet that he is safe but not at Laurence's. As the day goes on his tweets to Mercutio grow more anxious. In the meanwhile news of Tybalt's death reach the Capulet house along with rumors that Romeo was the one who killed him. Juliet does not believe these accusations and is terrified that Romeo might be dead too. She also threatens to cut her wrists. Jess, who is worried about her hysteric reactions, agrees to meet up with Laurence, who still tweets that Tybalt's death was an accident, to sort things out.
Romeo realizes that Mercutio is dead and Juliet finally believes him being alive. Jess sneaks Juliet out of the house and brings her to Laurence's where Romeo has been hiding ever since. They decide that it is the best decision to get Romeo out of the country and that Juliet should not go with him.
Romeo is laying low in an unspecified European country and finds out that Laurence had let his mouth run away with him. Juliet finds out that Romeo really killed Tybalt. She confronts Romeo on Twitter but nothing is resolved.
Juliet reads the tweets of the night of Tybalt's death and realizes that he has been to blame. She apologizes to Romeo and announces herself as Mrs Montague. She begs Jess to let her move in rather than to having to move to Australia. Mr. Capulet storms off to Laurence's coffee shop and accuses him of helping his daughter to run away from home.
Jess persuades Juliet to go home with her and after Laurence's refusal to send him money Romeo gets some money together and returns to England.
Fifth week.
Juliet is trying to attend Mercutio's funeral but is stopped by her father who also tried to hit her after finding out about the wedding between her and Romeo. Jess pulls her father away and escapes to her apartment in despair. Romeo tells Juliet he is making his way back to her and posted a poem about his dead friend.
Juliet is said to move to Australia with her stepmother on Wednesday, no arguments. Jess is still disappointed about her father and keeps the distance to the family. Laurence tries to help Juliet and gets chased away. After that he leaves some strange messages on his website about leaving the milk in his apartment while he was away. Romeo is beseeching Juliet not to go and constantly tries to get in touch with Laurence. After that he switches his phone off.
Juliet announces that she is getting settled with the idea of moving to Sydney. Jess is pleased to hear that and concentrates on her career plans. Laurence also encourages Juliet but also made some tweets about junction 10 which turns out to be a hotel he settles in later reminding Romeo of their meeting. Romeo's phone is still switched off. Juliet sneaks off to Laurence's apartment and sent a series of twitpics of the 'milk' she was drinking and tweets about her future together with Romeo. After that she passes out.
Romeo turns on his phone finally and understands Juliet's tweets as suicide notes only to be assured by her seemingly dead body in Laurence's apartment. He takes some pills washed down with whiskey. Jess and Laurence tuned in too late to stop him. Juliet awakes with Romeo's dead body beside her. She ignores Jess's tweets and kills herself by cutting her wrists. Jess rushes off to Laurence's apartment and finds the two dead bodies. Laurence, too afraid to come home, drives around and is depressed about the consequences of his plan. Jess begs him to come back to help her understand the disaster.
Jess wakes up with a hangover and is supported by many of her followers on Twitter. Laurence finally decides to come home and advices a young hitchhiker on the way to return home. Jess notices a picture in the middle of the town, it is a painting of her mother by Montague with a note saying 'sorry'. Then a final message from Tybalt's account appears for her: I'm so sorry. Come home. Dad x.
Characterization.
Romeo Montague.
Romeo is a 19 year old who takes every day as it comes. He wants to make the best out of everything he does and is enjoying his life at home as an only child. After passing all of his final exams at school he decided to take a year off and works part-time at a card-board factory. He does not seem to have many close friends besides Mercutio but is enjoying the moments with him to the fullest. He seems very quiet at first but is definitely an eye-catcher. Although Montague Sr never told him too he dislikes the Capulets for what they did to his family.
Mercutio.
He is not the handsomest 19 year old but one of the most charming. He uses this talent to seduce girls and to get away with most of the things he does but if this doesn't work out he sure knows how to use his fists. He is an only child and his parents live in south France since he turned 18. They bought him an apartment in the city and he gets a decent allowance every month. After school he decided to take a year off like Romeo and spends most of the time with him and the Montagues. He is very loyal to them and wishes to be part of the family.
Juliet Capulet.
A shy gentle 15 year old girly girl who likes to stay at home and hang out with her sister Jess who is also her best friend. She is very innocent and seems to have little experience with anything to do with the real world. She likes singing and making music on her guitar other than that she is a typical teen and enjoys "Twilight" and Robert Pattinson. Her father is very strict and she is not allowed very much but her personality is set to obey most of the time and she enjoys being at home in her room. She doesn't seem to be very popular and doesn't have so many friends besides her sister. As she was still too young to know about the events going on the feud between the Capulets and the Montagues seems strange to her.
Jess Capulet.
She is a 23 year old trainee solicitor at a corporate law firm. She is very driven and hardworking. She always has a project going on and is always taking on extra work. Currently she is training for the London marathon. Since their mother died she has been the mother for her younger siblings that's why they nicknamed her 'nurse'. She lives on her own and has a small apartment in a nearby town. She tries to keep the family together and keeps close contact to her sister and dad and her brother too. As the oldest she has the most memories of their mother and still blames Montague Sr. for her death.
Tybalt Capulet.
At the age of seven his mother died, his dad remarried hastily and he was shipped off to boarding school. He has been angry at everybody in his family and also at life ever since. But most of all he is angry at Montague Sr. who he thinks is to blame for all this mess. Without him the accident would have never happened and his mother would still be alive. Other than that he portrays this anger within his behavior in school, where he is about to be expelled, and with everybody else in his way. The only place he seems to calm down is at Laurence's coffee shop. Laurence seems like a mentor to him but he also provides him with dope. If it was not for that Tybalt would have nowhere to go.
Laurence Friar.
He is the 38 year old coffee/internet shop owner in town. He tries to do good and offers his help to the teenagers in town but he is also a local drug dealer and sells dope to them. He tries to help the community by supporting the young people and giving them a safe haven with his coffee shop to hang out and have fun. He grew up in this town and knows how it is to live in the rural area, he tries to give them a place to stay other than hanging out in the streets. He also supports the local disabled group and arranges gatherings for the local youth like his ping pong tournament. Back in the days he used to be friends with Montague Sr until the accident. Nowadays he tries to loosen the tension between the two families and helps the young couple to sort things out.
Realization/form.
The actors all performed on Twitter using small comments with 140 characters (tweets) to tell their followers what they were up to. Although other internet platforms, Facebook, Xboxlive, Audioboo, YouTube and WordPress were used too, Twitter as the main media was even more useful to perform as the people who were interested in seeing this event could just follow the characters or even just their favorite one. The actors improvised around a prepared story grid and were free to interpret the events in their own way using their own words. The feature that came out of this was a live story-telling situation which could definitely also be based on real events. Followers who tuned in later could have always had the impression they're following somebody's real life story. This resembles Orson Welles "War of the Worlds" being read on the radio back in the days. The result was the same. The other media represented, such as YouTube, were used to simply support the tweets in a more striking way. Juliets video posts on YouTube had the function of showing her as a real person with a real voice and also to simply describe her character and her environment. The fact that Romeo was really found playing "Call of Duty" on Xboxlive made the realness of the character even more profound as you could actually join him in his game. The variety of the media usage made it easier for the followers to connect to the characters and certainly displayed the variety of streams used by the youth of the 21st century. This made it possible to take the story of Romeo and Juliet to modern times and to get a younger generation more interested in Shakespearean literature.

History.
Broomfield Academy was founded in 1995, and was formerly named Academic Achievement Academy and Meritor Academy. Renamed Broomfield Academy in 2007, the school is located on a property in Broomfield, Colorado. The early education program was founded and has been operational since 1968. Owned and operated for over 30 years by Bonnie Andresen, the preschool was originally named Bonnie Bain Preschool. Bonnie, along with her husband Roger, expanded the school from its location in the original Marsh farmhouse, adding a 10,000 sq. ft preschool building and renaming the school A Child's Adventure Land. An enclosed swimming pool was added, along with a metal multipurpose building, now called "The Den." The property was leased to Children's World for an 8-year period starting in 1999. A Child's Adventure Land was renamed Children's World. The elementary school, opened in 1995 as Academic Achievement Academy was operated as Meritor Academy. In 2007, after Knowledge Learning Corporation, which had acquired Children's World decided not to renew the property lease, Bonnie leased the property to Academic Achievement Group, which later purchased the property. In continuous operation for over 40 years, thousands of local children have been educated at what is now Broomfield Academy. Throughout its history, there has been a continuous focus on providing individualized education, maintaining small class sizes and having a focus on character education. Bonnie's legacy continues, and there are now numerous children attending Broomfield Academy whose parents, and even grandparents, attended the school. Some of the Broomfield Academy teachers currently at the school have worked there since it was Meritor Academy, Children's World and A Child's Adventure Land.
Broomfield Academy's academic preschool program, called Jr. Kindergarten, was expanded in 2008, and now serves children ages 2 ½-5. The focus of the academic preschool (sometimes referred to as Pre-kindergarten) is to assure that children are fully prepared for kindergarten and for their elementary education. The swimming pool, used by all of the children as part of the physical education program was renovated in 2009 and provides swimming lessons to the community at-large. The middle school program, which serves grades 5-8, was added in 2011.

W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 (Belgrade)

W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Belgrade were the joint 16th edition of the W.A.K.O. world championships - the second event would be held later that year in Coimbra, Portugal. They were for amateur male and female kickboxers and covered the following categories; K-1, Low-Kick and Light-Contact. Weight classes for men ranged from light bantamweight (51 kg or 112 lb) to super heavyweight (over 91 kg or 200.6 lb), while the women's ranged from featherweight (52 kg or 114.6 lb) to super heavyweight (over 70 kg or 154 lb). More information on the categories, weight classes and rules is provided in the various sections below. In total there were 1085 athletes at the championships, representing sixty countries including China (taking part for the very first time), fighting in 49 tournaments. The Belgrade championships were held at the Pionir Hall in Belgrade, Serbia from Monday, September 24 to Monday, October 1, 2007.
K-1.
W.A.K.O.'s K-1 category uses the same rules set by the K-1 organization and combine a mixture of techniques from Muay Thai, Karate, western boxing and other forms of stand up fighting. The main difference between K-1 rules and other forms of kickboxing is the use of the clinch and knees – which have recently been limited to one knee per clinch. Attacks that are legal include strikes to the head (front, side and forehead), the torso (front and side), leg (any part) and foot/feet (sweeps only). As mentioned before fighters are also allowed to knees (only one hand to clinch and one knee strike per clinch) and can use the back fist/spinning back fist technique. Strikes that are illegal include attacks to the top of the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and shots to the groin. Techniques involving elbows are also illegal. Due to the amateur nature of W.A.K.O. championships all fighters must wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard gloves. 
Each fight is three, two-minute rounds and is scored by three judges who score successful (legal) strikes that are not blocked, and are thrown with full power. As with other forms, illegal strikes may result in a point(s) deduction or even disqualification. Unlike Full-Contact and Low-Kick it is not necessary for the minimum six kicks per round to be counte. Victory can be achieved by a point's decision, technical knockout or knockout, abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (other fighter is unable to participate). If a fighter is knocked down three times in the fight he will automatically lose via technical knockout. More detail on K-1 rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.
Weight classes in K-1 at Belgrade were similar to that of the Low-Kick category, with the men having eleven weight classes from bantamweight (54 kg or 118.8 lb) to super heavyweight (over 90 kg or 200.2 lb), while the women's had six beginning at featherweight (52 kg or 114.4 lb) and ending super heavyweight (over 70 kg or 154 lb). Belarus was the most successful nation in K-1 winning five gold, three silver and five bronze in both the male and female categories. 
Low-Kick.
Low-Kick is similar to Full-Contact kickboxing only that as well as allowing kicks and punches to the head and body, it also allows clean kicks to be made to opponents legs. Attacks that are legal include strikes to the head (front, side and forehead), the torso (front and side), leg (thigh) and foot/feet (sweeps only). Strikes that are illegal include attacks to the top of the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and the groin. All fighters are required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard gloves.
A minimum of six kicks must be thrown each round or points may be deducted by the referee. Each fight is three, two minute rounds and is scored by three judges. The judges will score successful (legal) strikes that are not blocked, and are thrown with full power. Illegal moves may result in points deduction or if repeated, disqualification. In the event of a draw after three rounds the judges will base the victor on who was stronger in the final round, or failing that will use their remarks from each round to deduce who wins. Victory can be achieved by a point's decision, technical knockout or knockout, abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (other fighter is unable to participate). If a fighter is knocked down three times in the fight he will automatically lose via technical knockout. More detail on Low-Kick rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.
At Belgrade the men's Low-Kick competition had twelve six weight classes starting at light bantamweight (51 kg or 112.2 lb) to super heavyweight (over 91 kg or 200.2 lb), while the women's had six ranging from featherweight (52 kg or 114.4 lb) to super heavyweight (over 70 kg or 154 lb), while . As with Light-Contact, by the championships end, Russia was the strongest nation, having won an impressive haul of six gold, two silver and two bronze medals. 
Light-Contact.
In this form of kickboxing fighters are scored on their ability to land controlled and clean strikes with an emphasis put on style over power. Fighters that fight too aggressively may be cautioned by the referee and, if the offence is repeated, may be disqualified, although strikes that are too light (such as a push or brush) will not be scored either. Attacks are allowed to the head (front, side and forehead), the torso (front and side) and leg (foot sweeps). As mentioned before excessive force is illegal as well as strikes to the top of the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and below the belt. Light-Contact is seen as the intermediate stage between Semi and Full-Contact kickboxing involving more physicality than Semi but less so than Full. All fighters are required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard 10oz gloves.
Fighters score the following points for landing a controlled strike on their opponent; punch, kick to body, foot sweep (1 point), kick to head, jumping kick to body (2 points), jumping kick to head (3 points). Each fight is three, two-minute rounds and is scored by three judges. In the event of a draw the match will be scored electronically. Victory can be achieved by points decision, technical knockout (usually when one fighter is so dominant the referee is forced to stop the contest), abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (other fighter is unable to participate). More detail on Light-Contact rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.
Light-Contact uses slightly different weight classes from Low-Kick and K-1. At Belgrade the men had nine weight classes, starting at 57 kg or 125.4 lb and ending at over 94 kg (206.8 lb), while the women's Light-Contact competition had five weight classes beginning at 55 kg (121 lb) and ending at over 70 kg (154 lb). At the end of the championships, Russia was the most successful nation in Light-Contact having won five gold and two silver medals.
Overall Medals Standing (Top 5).
The nation that came out on top at the W.A.K.O. Amateur World Championships 2007 in Belgrade were Russia who amassed fourteen gold, ten silvers and ten bronze medals in all categories, both male and female.

Dubautia imbricata

Dubautia imbricata is a rare species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common names bog dubautia and imbricate dubautia. It is endemic to Hawaii where it is known only from the island of Kauai. There are four known occurrences. Like other "Dubautia" this plant is known as na`ena`e.
This member of the silversword alliance was first described to science in 1981 after it was discovered in a Kauaian rainforest. It grows in just a few spots in boggy forest habitat in the understory of ʻōhiʻa lehua ("Metrosideros polymorpha") trees among sedges in the genera "Oreobolus" and "Rhynchospora".
There are two subspecies. Both are rare and ssp. "imbricata" was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 2010.
This plant is a clumpy, bushy shrub which reaches 2.5 meters tall by 2 meters wide. The oppositely arranged leaves are up to 15 centimeters long by 2.5 wide. The inflorescence is a cluster of many flower heads, each of which contains several yellow flowers.
Both subspecies are known to hybridize with other "Dubautia".

SOX2OT

SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT) is a long non-coding RNA, containing at least 5 exons. The SOX2 gene, an important regulator of neurogenesis, lies within one of the introns of SOX2OT. SOX2OT and SOX2DOT (an isoform of SOXOT transcribed from a distal highly conserved element) are expressed in zones of neurogenesis within the brain. It is associated with central nervous system structures in zebrafish and chicken embryonic brains, and is dynamically regulated during embryogenesis. SOX2OT may play a role in vertebrate development.

All five of the class were jumboized in 1990-92 by being cut in two and a 108-foot (35.7 m) section inserted, increasing their capacities from 120,000 bbls to 180,000 bbls, adding capacity for 300 tons of munitions and improving underway replenishment capabilities. The class was retired in 1998-99 after less than 20 years of service as a result of post-Cold War force reductions, and the advent of the more economical diesel-powered s.

Inertia (short story)

Inertia is a short story written by Nancy Kress, and published in 2004 as part of the book "."
Characters.
The story is narrated by Gram, a grandmother, who is one of few who was not born in the camp. Gram is very observant and wise. Mamie is Gram's daughter she is manipulative, immature and self-centered. Rachel is the daughter of Mamie and her dead ex-husband, she is intelligent, obedient, and avoids confrontation. Peter is Mamie's boyfriend who likes to play poker and is considered a player. McHabe is an underground doctor who wants to test an experimental cure, and spread the mental part of the disease throughout the world. Jenni is the daughter of Mamie's dead husbands brother and Mamie is her guardian but she lives alone. Jenni is good looking, eager, supportive and passive aggressive. Rachel and Jenni are cousins.
Peter appears to be the stereotypical view of feminism that all feminists think that all men are jerks and cheat on their girlfriends. Gram like an intelligent and wise elder person. Mamie is the mildly crazy girlfriend/mother who can not break up with her boyfriend. McHabe is like the creepy guy in movies who knows way to much that you shouldn't trust, but also makes a lot of sense. Jenni is the innocent person who attempts to dive in front of a bullet. Rachael is the character who is smart and quiet but steps up and becomes a hero near the end. The guards are the standard bad guys who don't respect human life or personal freedom.
Plot summary.
Inertia is about a group of people infected with something similar to leprosy but incurable, benign, and is possibly calming. This disease has been well contained for over sixty years. These people are sent to a guarded camp where they do not pay taxes, but congress took away their right to vote. They occasionally receive donations from the outside world, but other than that they are self-sustaining. They story starts with a doctor sneaking into the camp without a biohazard suit, which is unusual because he can't leave, asking questions about people who have been there the longest. He finds Gram then starts asking her questions about the disease. Then we find out that the disease doesn't hurt and is only a cosmetic issue for the skin, however it lessens emotions and calms one making them depressed. All research and testing of the disease has been made illegal after 14 people died from a failed experimental cure. Mr. McHabe has an untested experimental cure from an underground research lab for early cases of the disease, but it only helps the skin leaving mental effects present and contagious.
When the colonies were first set up many sociologists predicted the colonies would descend into chaos and war zones but they didn't. McHabe thinks the mental effects of the disease are why the colonies work so well and have very little violence. The outside world has become fairly violent and America is involved in several wars. McHabe wants to infect the world with the mental part of the disease so there will be less war and violence. He gives the cure to Jenni and another kid without anyone else knowing including Mamie and Gram. Later that night McHabe tells Mamie that he gave Jenni the cure, the next Mamie tells the guards about McHabe. The guards come into the camp, wearing biohazard suits and wielding guns, they shoot and kill McHabe when he tries to explain himself. Then Rachel gets ready to go out into the world and spread the disease, although she still has the full disease and her face is obviously affected by the disease.
Contemporary analysis.
There are many recurring themes in this story. Peter is unfaithful and looks at other women such as when Gram thinks "But Peter is watching Rachel, not Mamie". McHabe knows random things that should be impossible like he knew how Rachel's father died. Termites knocking down their bedroom wall is mentioned multiple times. Gram's mind wanders when she thinks like "Again that restless, furtive reach for a non-existent cigarette". 
The author uses repetition by mentioning termites multiple times. Also when she says peter had a wolfish smile she used anthropomorphism. This story hasn't received any awards.

Katarzyna Grochola (born July 18, 1957) is a Polish writer and journalist.
Biography.
Grochola was born in Krotoszyn, Poland. Her mother was a specialist in Polish studies and her father was a lawyer. She finished Julius Słowacki grammar school in Warsaw. She always wanted to become a writer but by the time she took up writing she worked as a hospital attendant, a consultant in a marriage bureau, and a confectioner’s assistant.

She participated in XI edition of Dancing with the Stars broadcast by TVN channel and together with her dance partner, Jan Klimek, took third place. 
In Poland her books were quite popular and sold thousands of copies. Grochola's collection of stories "Podanie o miłość" was translated into Russian and her novel "Nigdy w Życiu!" into Russian, German and Slovakian. "Nigdy w Życiu!" was advertised as a Polish Bridget Jones but it met with cool reception of literary criticism. The author was accused of pandering to lowbrow tastes and of copying western patterns, yet the commercial success of this book (as well as her following books) proved how great is the demand in Poland for such an attractive popular literature. What's more "Nigdy w Życiu!", the first volume of the “Żaby i Anioły” series, was the greatest bestseller among polish books in 2001. In February 2004 a movie by the same title was released under the direction of Ryszard Zatorski, with Danuta Stenka starring as Judyta. The second volume published in 2002, "Serce na temblaku", achieved enormous success. Third part of the series, entitled "Ja wam pokażę" was also adapted for the screen - this time the leading part was portrayed by Grażyna Wolszczak. 
Katarzyna Grochola is also a columnist and co-scriptwriter of one of the most popular Polish TV Series like: "M jak miłość" and "Na dobre i na złe". "Osobowość Ćmy", a new novel that was released on April 15, 2005 was the first book to be published by Grochola's own publishing house, Wydawnictwo Autorskie.
Awards.
Katarzyna Grochola received 4 awards for her plays "Pozwól mi odejść" and "Kot mi schudł" in a dramatic contest Tespis 2000.
Also one of her novels, "Nigdy w życiu!", received an award in AS EMPiK-u contest in 2001 and 2002 and "Zielone drzwi" was hailed as a Bestseller of 2010.

William Field (minister)

William Field (6 January 1768 – 16 August 1851) was an English Unitarian minister.
Early life.
Field was born at Stoke Newington on 6 January 1768. John Field, his father, a London medical practitioner, and founder of the London Annuity Society, was a man of property, who married Anne, daughter of Thomas Cromwell, and sister of Oliver Cromwell. Field got a good classical training; while at school he corresponded with his father in Latin. He studied for the ministry first at Homerton, but left that institution for doctrinal reasons soon after the appointment of John Fell. In 1788 he entered Daventry Academy under Thomas Belsham, and left when Belsham resigned (June 1789).
Religious career.
Field succeeded James Kettle in 1789 as minister of the presbyterian congregation at Warwick, Warwickshire, where he was ordained on 12 July 1790. On this occasion Belsham gave the charge, and Joseph Priestley preached. Dr. Samuel Parr, who then first met Priestley, attended the service and the ordination dinner. Thus began Field's close intimacy with Parr, a connection fostered by their common devotion to classical studies. Field at once (1791) started a Sunday school (the first in Warwick). This led him into a squabble with some local clergy. Field, who was always ready for a pamphlet war, issued the first of many productions of his incisive pen, in which the dignity of style, and the profusion of literary and classical illustration, contrast curiously with the pettiness of the disputes. His meeting-house, rebuilt 1780, was fitted with a sloping floor, to improve its quality as an auditorium; Field excited some comment by surmounting the front of the building with a stone cross. About 1830 he undertook the charge of an old Presbyterian meeting-house at Kenilworth, conducting afternoon service in addition to his Warwick duties. This meeting-house was rebuilt (1846) by his son Edwin Wilkins Field. Field remained in active duty for nearly sixty years. He resigned Warwick in 1843, and was succeeded in 1844 by Henry Ashton Meeson, M.D. At Kenilworth he was succeeded in 1850 by John Gordon.
Teaching career.
Field kept a boarding-school for many years at Leam, near Warwick. This led to his publishing some educational manuals, of which the most valuable was his ‘Questions on the Gospel History,’ recommended in the '‘Critical Review'’ (June 1794) to theological students in the two universities. His history of Warwick and his life of Parr are important works.
Death and family.
He died at Leam on 16 August 1851; a marble slab to his memory was placed in High Street Chapel, Warwick. By his wife, Mary (Wilkins), who died at Liverpool on 2 Oct. 1848, aged 64, he had a numerous family, of whom Edwin Wilkins was the eldest; Horace was an architect. Field was of diminutive stature, with a noble head; his portrait has been engraved. He never forgot the distinction of his Cromwell blood; his extensive correspondence was both erudite and racy; he was a genial host, and his conversation, in spite of his constitutional deafness, was very enjoyable.
Publications.
Field published a multitude of pamphlets and sermons,
In addition to these his chief publications were: 
Field was a frequent contributor of critical and other articles to the ‘Monthly Repository’ and ‘Christian Reformer.’

Soft detention

Soft detention(软禁) is a form of house arrest used in the People's Republic of China to control political dissidents. It has its roots in the practices of the Chinese Empire which employed it as early as the Northern Song Dynasty when those such as Su Shi who criticized the emperor were subjected to it. Traditionally, and in modern practice, there are three levels of restriction; the loosest, "juzhu," restricts the detainee to their home district. This restriction was employed on the history teacher Yuan Tengfei who included information about banned aspects of modern Chinese history in his lectures. The second level, “anzhi,” employed anciently on Su Shi, restricts the prisoner to their home, but they may be allowed to go for a walk or go to work. The severest form, “bianguan,” which was imposed on the human rights activist Chen Guangcheng involves limited movement of the prisoner to their home, constant surveillance, restriction of contract with others, and, sometimes, harassment,

Northern Oak

Northern Oak is a folk metal band from Sheffield, England. The band formed in 2006 and their debut album, "Tales From Rivelin" came out in 2008. The band then released two live studio EPs entitled "Into The Attic, 28th July 2009" and "Northern Oak", before releasing their second full-length album "Monuments" in December 2010, to acclaim from a number of underground music publications such as Metal Hammer Magazine, Zero Tolerance Magazine, and Terrorizer
Northern Oak use traditional instruments alongside a modern heavy metal instrument setup (electric guitar, bass guitar, drums), with flautist Catie Williams utilising the flute, the alto flute and the recorder in various songs. They also use a keyboard to synthesize other traditional instruments such as harpsichord, church organ, bagpipes and the triangle. The band's name comes from their location (in the North of England) and the English Oak tree, which is symbolic of their appreciation for nature and the English countryside.
History.
The band was founded late in 2006 by Chris Mole, original keyboardist Elliot Sinclair, original vocalist James Harris and founding drummer Daniel Loughran. Over several months of practicing and development, the band began to assemble a setlist and swiftly produced their first demo, entitled "Rivelin".
The band performed their first gig in 2007. Shortly afterwards the band was joined by another new member- flautist Catie Williams. At this point the band began to explore a much more folk-heavy sound, due to Williams' experience of and participation in the English folk music scene.
Soon afterwards, recording began on what would become the band's debut album, Tales From Rivelin. During this period the band played their second show at Under the Boardwalk, this time bidding farewell to Loughran, who left the band due to leaving Sheffield. As the band worked on getting the album finished and printed, some other line-up shifts occurred – a new drummer (Jesse Harrison) and bassist (Kimberley Sears) joined the band, as did a new vocalist (Carl Aspinall). Aspinall's tenure was short-lived due to his other commitments, however, and he was soon replaced by a long-time friend of the band, Martin Collins. 
The debut album, "Tales From Rivelin", was released in March 2008 and garnered some positive press, including two positive reviews from Terrorizer magazine and Zero Tolerance magazine. One of the tracks from the album, 'Madness of the Feral Moon', also appeared on Iron Age Records' Volume 1 compilation alongside bands such as Shieldwall, Oakenshield and No Remorse. Having played a number of shows to promote the album and spread their name and reputation, Northern Oak began working on new material for the next recorded work and to increase their repertoire of songs. They began to perform live much more frequently, playing six gigs in 2008 compared to two in 2007, including a slot at the 2008 Gathering of the Clans festival where they were introduced by Martin Walkyier of Sabbat and The Clan Destined fame. 
In March 2009, progress on new material was slowed by the departure of drummer Jesse Harrison and bassist Kimberley Sears. The band recruited another longtime friend, bassist Richard Allan, and a new drummer in the form of Paul Whibberley, conga player in the salsa band "Cuatro de Diciembre" with Williams. Work continued on material for a follow-up to "Tales From Rivelin", and in a short time the band’s setlist had expanded considerably. The first live practice EP, "Into The Attic, 28th July 2009" was released to give the band's fans a taster of the new material, and soon afterwards, discussions with Aled Pashley of the Welsh band Annwn led to Northern Oak signing to independent label Mynydd Du records. A second live practice EP, "Northern Oak", was recorded in August 2009 and provided another lo-fi preview of the band's new songs.
2009 also saw the band playing more shows across the country, performing at "Highland Fire Festival" in Edinburgh and Gathering of the Clans 2009 in Leicestershire, as well as a large number of shows in Sheffield.
In 2010, the band began recording their second full-length album, "Monuments". Recruiting Travis Smith to create some cover artwork for the album, Northern Oak began recording at the Sheffield University Soundhouse in May and concluded in October that year. On 11 December 2010, the band released the album at a masquerade-themed launch show at Sheffield Corporation, with support from their friends in Old Corpse Road and the Secrets of the Boudoir Burlesque troupe. Following the launch gig, founding keyboardist Elliot Sinclair left the band due to a lack of time brought about by his relocation to London, and was replaced by new keyboardist, Digby Brown.
On 7 June 2011, Northern Oak were one of the first bands announced for the New Blood Stage at Bloodstock Open Air Festival 2011. Their gig on 13 August 2011 at the Jägermeister stage at Bloodstock was the band's first acoustic set. 
In addition to their Bloodstock appearance, Northern Oak gigged extensively across England in 2011 in support of "Monuments", including a mini tour (called "The Great Exhibition") in the UK with Old Corpse Road, The Prophecy and Eibon La Furies in November.
Characteristics.
"Northern Oak" combines English folk melodies with progressive metal guitars and black metal vocals. The band uses traditional instruments including the flute, the alto flute and the recorder in their music, and synthesizes a number of other traditional instruments using a keyboard. The folk melodies incorporated into their songs have been drawn from flautist Catie William's knowledge of traditional English folk tunes- some are direct transcriptions of folk melodies (as in the songs 'Only Our Names Will Remain', which features the melody of the folk song The Snows They Melt the Soonest and 'The Scarlet Lady', which features an altered version of the melody from the folk song King of the Faeries), while others were created with that style in mind. The band's lyrics have a philosophical tone and focus on questions of mortality and existence, often through a naturalistic, historical or mythological framework.

Jack Leroy Shepard (May 13, 1931 – December 31, 1994) was an American professional baseball player, a catcher, who became a successful businessman and philanthropist after retiring from baseball at age 25 following three full seasons in the Major Leagues.
A native of Clovis, California, the , Shepard attended Stanford University, graduating in 1953 after serving as the captain of the first Cardinal team (then nicknamed the "Indians") to play in the College World Series. He signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates upon graduation on June 16 and made his Major League debut three days later against the St. Louis Cardinals at Sportsman's Park, substituting for starting catcher Mike Sandlock and singling in two at bats against Vinegar Bend Mizell. He also made two errors in the field. He spent part of the 1953 season in minor league baseball, playing in 84 games for the Denver Bears of the Class A Western League and batting .324, before returning to the Pirates for good from 1954–1956.
The Pirates of the mid-1950s were at one of the low ebbs of their history. Shepard's 1954–1956 clubs averaged 94 losses (against only 60 wins) per season. Despite their struggles, and his first-game jitters in 1953, Shepard gained a reputation as a stalwart defensive player, batted .304 in his first full season (when he was named Pirates' rookie of the year and selected to The Sporting News' all-rookie team) and became one of the team leaders. His 1956 manager, Bobby Bragan, said of him, "Shepard was the most intelligent catcher I've known. He handled pitchers well and could throw. He was good on plays at the plate. Fearless."
But Shepard's off-seasons were spent continuing his education at Stanford, where he obtained master's degrees in business and education. After serving as Pittsburgh's regular catcher in 1956, appearing in a career-high 100 games, he announced his retirement to become development director at his alma mater and begin a full-time career in business. All told, he played in 278 MLB games, and collected 195 hits.
He served as president and chief executive of a San Francisco-area telecommunications firm and a baseball equipment and indoor baseball and entertainment center company, and was a management consultant as well as a philanthropist on behalf of multiple Palo Alto, California-area institutions. He was a member of the Stanford and Fresno County athletic halls of fame.
Jack Shepard died at age 63 of cancer in Atherton, California.

A cakery is a specific establishment which produces and/or sells cakes; they may also sell cupcakes, muffins, sponges, as well as other baked goods that fall under the title of a cake. Products are baked on site in the same manner to that of a bakery but does not make or sell other associated items. The term "Cakery" may sometimes be used to get around the fact that "bakery" or "bakeries" have been taken as a name for many long established businesses and new entrants want to stand out.
Commonly a cakery does not sell anything that is not classed by definition as a cake:
"A sweet baked food made of flour, liquid, eggs, and other ingredients, such as raising agents and flavorings."
"A flat rounded mass of dough or batter, such as a pancake that is baked or fried." - from http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cake
By basic definition at least, this would not include breads, pastries (sweet or savoury) or puddings. A cakery's distinction from a general bakery may not be as strict as with a Patisserie for example, which is a legally protected class of pastry making establishments in some countries.

Joseph Finch Fenn

Joseph Finch Fenn (1820, Travancore – 1884) was an English clergyman, honorary canon of Gloucester.
Life.
Fenn was the son of the Rev. Joseph Fenn, minister of Blackheath Park Chapel, Kent. He was born in Travancore, India in 1820, and educated at Blackheath Proprietary School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. 1842, M.A. 1845, and B.D. 1877. He was ordained a deacon in 1845, and priest in the following year. In 1844 he had gained a fellowship of his college, which he held until 1847, when, on accepting the vicarage of Stotfold, Bedfordshire, he resigned. In 1860 he was appointed by the trustees to the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Cheltenham, on the resignation of Archibald Boyd; in 1877 he became chaplain to the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, and in 1879 an honorary canon of Gloucester; and in 1880 he was elected one of the two proctors in convocation for the united diocese.
Though a good scholar and of very extensive reading, Fenn published little, devoting himself to his parochial duties, including the careful preparation of his sermons. Some of these, forming a volume entitled "Lenten Teachings, 1877–84", have been published since his death. He kept clear of the controversies dividing the church of England. He took an active share in all movements for the improvement of the young, and was the eloquent promoter of the free library system in Cheltenham. During the latter years of his life he was a strong adherent to the cause of total abstinence. He was generally regarded as an evangelical, but was not a party man. He supported the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel as heartily as the Church Missionary Society, and had a leaning to the old high church section. He declined an offer of the benefice of St. Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, in 1877, in compliance with the wishes of the Christ Church congregation. The church of St. Stephen, Tivoli, in the district of Christ Church, was erected mainly by his exertions to meet the wants of an increasing population, and he contributed liberally towards the undertaking. He was twice married, and has left issue. He died on 22 July 1884, and was buried in his family vault in the churchyard of Leckhampton, near Cheltenham. A large memorial brass has been erected in Christ Church.

It consists of a length of tube of around 4mm to 6mm in diameter, often made of coiled steel springs, with a push-button on one end. Three metal wires protrude from the other end, each sprung to bend outwards, away from the tube's axis, but with their tips bent inwards to form teeth. The push-button drives the wires down the tube, where their natural springiness causes them to spread further outwards, opening the teeth. When the button is released, an internal spring withdraws the wires which, constrained by the tube, are forced together, closing the teeth.
By pressing the end of it, the user allows the teeth to open up and by releasing their hold, the teeth will grab whatever object is below the grabber.
Use.
The tool is mainly used to retrieve screws, although is also helpful in retrieving jammed bits in the motherboard. They mainly come in sizes ranging from about 4 to 9 inches. The outer shell is usually plastic, although higher end retrievers can have metal casing and reinforced inner material.
Other uses include, but are not limited to; paper removal, device handling, item manoeuvering, micro-cleaning, small parts retrieval and minor dust removal.

Trams in Lisbon

The Lisbon tramway network () serves the municipality of Lisbon, capital city of Portugal. In operation since 1873, it presently comprises five urban lines.
History.
The first tramway in Lisbon entered service on 17 November 1873, as a horsecar line. On 30 August 1901, Lisbon's first electric tramway commenced operations. Within a year, all of the city's tramways had been converted to electric traction.
Up until 1959, the network of lines was further developed, and in that year it reached its greatest extent. At that time, there was a total of 27 tram lines in Lisbon, of which six operated as circle lines. As the circle lines operated in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions, each with its own route number, it is more correct to speak of a total of 24 tram routes, all of them running on narrow gauge tram lines.
The construction of the Lisbon Metro and the expansion of the bus system began the slow decline of the network.
The five remaining lines only operates in the southern centre and west of the city. Despite the relevant tourist attraction, those lines are still very important because of sections of the city's topography can only be crossed by small trams. Tram 15 also connects the entire western river front of the city to the centre and allows a better flow of passengers with the bus system towards an area that still is not served by the metro.
Although reports prepared by both the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and the Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich concluded that the network should be retained and even extended, the process of decline has continued. However, some work has recently been done on preparing the Carmo–Campolide line for reopening.

Dubautia kenwoodii

Dubautia kenwoodii is an "extremely rare" species of flowering plant in the aster family. It is endemic to Hawaii where it is known only from the island of Kauai. Only one plant has ever been seen: the type specimen. A part of this plant was collected in 1991 and the individual was described as a new species in 1998. It was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 2010. Like other "Dubautia" this plant is known as na`ena`e.
This member of the silversword alliance was discovered growing on a cliff along the Kalalau Rim adjacent to the Kalalau Valley on Kauai. The single plant was examined and collected by the biologist Ken Wood, who rappelled down the cliff to view it. It was later described to science and named for him. After Hurricane Iniki in 1992 this specimen was absent and feared extirpated. Biologists are hopeful that more individuals of this "exceedingly rare" and "critically endangered" plant will be located as more of Kauai is surveyed.
The only known specimen of the plant was described as a shrub half a meter tall with oppositely arranged leaves up to 12 centimeters long by 2 wide. The blades are shiny on top and more pale on the undersides. The flower heads contain several flowers which turn "rusty yellow in age".

Torre de la Parada

The Torre de la Parada is a former hunting lodge that was located in present-day Monte de El Pardo in Fuencarral-El Pardo, near the Royal Palace of El Pardo, some way outside Madrid in the Sierra de Guadarrama. It was mostly destroyed by fire when taken in 1714 by Austrian troops in the War of Spanish Succession, though the ruins remain. 
History.
It was first built in 1547-49, with Luis de Vega as architect. During the years 1635–40 it was a site for a major architectural and decorative project by King Philip IV of Spain who was a great hunting enthusiast. He commissioned the Spanish architect Juan Gómez de Mora to renovate it in 1636, and had it decorated by leading painters, including Rubens and Velázquez, who contributed some of his "jester" portraits, including "The Jester Don John of Austria", "The Jester Don Diego de Acedo", "Portrait of Francisco Lezcano" and "Portrait of Pablo de Valladolid". His "Aesop" and "Menippus" are also thought to have been intended for the lodge, as well as several of his well-known portraits of the royal family relaxed in hunting or riding clothes, including "Prince Balthasar Charles as a Hunter". 
Rubens was commissioned in 1636 to produce sixty mythological paintings, which he managed to do in about 18 months, assisted by Jacob Jordaens, Cornelis de Vos, Pieter Snayers, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Theodoor van Thulden, Jan Boeckhorst and others, working to his designs. Forty of the paintings survive, as well as many of Rubens' oil sketches and drawings. Most of all these works are in the Prado in Madrid. 
The best paintings were later moved elsewhere, especially in 1710, but in 1806 a travel book describes paintings by the Flemish painters Paul de Vos, Erasmus Quellinus II, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Jan Cossiers, and "Yoris" (possibly Joris van Son who worked with Erasmus Quellinus).

Kennebec-class oiler

The "Kennebec"-class oilers were sixteen United States Navy medium oilers built during World War II to three related designs at Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard of Sparrows Point, Maryland and Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. of Chester, Pennsylvania, all of which survived the war. Two are still in commercial service as of 2011.
All of the ships of the class initially were to be built for private companies, but the outset of World War II, the ships were transferred to the United States Maritime Commission and given new names. Later, when allocated to the U.S. Navy, they were renamed again.
In some cases the "Kennebec" class is divided into three classes, the Kennebec class (AO-36 to AO-40, AO-48), the Mattaponi class (AO-41 to AO-44, AO-47) and the Chiwawa class (AO-68 to 72). The first two classes were of the T2 and T2-A designs, built by different shipbuilders, and the "Chiwawa"s were of the T3-S-A1 design, mainly differing in having only a 7,000 shp engine and a top speed of 15.3 knots.
History.
One of the first acts of the War Shipping Administration, established in February 1942, was to address the Navy's pressing need for oilers by requisitioning five tankers in service or under construction for civilian companies. Three of these were 16.5-knot Type T2 "national defense tankers" designed by the Maritime Commission with potential militarization in mind and built by Bethlehem Steel for Socony-Vacuum Oil Co: the "Corsicana, Caddo" and "Calusa." A month later the WSA requisitioned six more: Socony's "Colina" and "Conastoga", together with four similar ships building at Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock for Keystone Tankships to an enlarged design, later called T2-A: "Kalkay, Ellkay, Jorkay" and "Emkay." "Corsicana" was commissioned as USS "Kennebec", becoming the lead ship of the class; "Kalkay" was renamed "Mattaponi" and gave that name to the T2-A subclass. In June the WSA moved to acquire the remaining member of each group, "Aekay" and "Catawba."
The T2 design had itself been based on two ships built by Bethlehem Steel in 1938-39, "Mobilfuel" and "Mobilube"; the T2's principal difference was MarCom's inclusion of more powerful engines to produce the Navy's desired 16.5 knots. In the meantime MarCom under the State of Emergency had ordered thirteen duplicates of "Mobilfuel" for the merchant marine; the first of these were nearing completion in late 1942 when the Navy, still very short of oilers, requisitioned the first five starting with "Samoset" (ex-"Mobiloil"), renamed USS "Chiwawa." Other than being limited to 15 knots, the "Chiwawas" were effectively identical to the "Kennebecs," despite being assigned the confusing design code T3-S-A1.
All sixteen ships survived the war, but were decommissioned shortly afterwards in favor of the larger, faster "Cimarron" class. "Kennebec", "Merrimack", "Kankakee", "Mattaponi", "Monongahela", "Tappahannock", and "Neches" were recommissioned for the U.S. Navy after World War II. "Mattaponi" and "Tappahanock" were reactivated four times, serving until 1970.
"Chiwawa" (now "Lee A. Tregurtha") and "Neshanic" (now "American Victory") are still in commercial service on the Great Lakes.

Ozanam's naturally weak constitution fell a prey to consumption, which he tried to cure by visiting Italy, where he had been born, but on the sea voyage back to France his condition worsened and he died at Marseilles on September 8, 1853. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in the cathedral church Notre Dame de Paris in 1997.

In the intervening years she was to emerge as a strong figure in her own right, actively supporting many good causes, including the missionary work of Cardinal Charles Lavigerie and the Oeuvre du Bon-Pasteur.

Belgrade–Pristina negotiations

Belgrade–Pristina negotiations are a series of talks between the Republic of Serbia and the partially recognised Republic of Kosovo. Serbia claims Kosovo as its southern province under United Nations administration, and rejects its independence. The negotiations began in March 2011. They are the first negotiations between the two entities since Kosovo declared independence, and although seen as status neutral, are met with popular dissent in both Kosovo and Serbia itself.
Background.
The Republic of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence on 17 February 2008, and that move has only been partially recognised internationally. Serbia took the issue to the International Court of Justice for their advisory opinion. The court's verdict was that it wasn't illegal for Kosovo to declare independence. After the verdict Serbia and the European Union submitted a resolution to the United Nations General Assembly which called for technical negotiations between the governments in Belgrade and Pristina. The Serbia-EU resolution passed in the UN General Assembly. The talks were delayed due to Kosovo's government collapsing, forcing Kosovo into early elections.
The Negotiations.
The talks take place in Brussels, Belgium and are mediated by the European Union represented by Robert Cooper. Borko Stefanović leads the Belgrade negotiating team and Edita Tahiri leads the Pristina negotiating team. The talks began on 8 March 2011 and feature three main issues:
First Round.
The First Round of dialogue took place on 8–9 March 2011 and covered economic co-operation between the two parties. Other issues on the agenda during the first round of dialogue were telecommunications, air traffic, customs seals, land books and civil records.
Second Round.
The second round of negotiations was delayed until 28 March 2011. Issues discussed in the second round of talks were electricity and possibly Freedom of Movement, as well as concluding first round topics such as Kosovo's customs seal, air traffic and Kosovo's participation in regional initiatives. On 28 March, the representative discussed land books and registries of births, deaths and marriages, as well as power supply issues. Stefanović stated that "Certain progress has been achieved on land books, birth registries and electric energy supply; we laid out our proposal and hope that there will finally be a positive wrap-up of these topics at the next meeting".
Third Round.
The third round of talks took place on 15 April 2011 and the issues discussed were freedom of movement, registration plates for vehicles and the recognition of diplomas.
Fourth Round.
The fourth round was held on 17 and 18 May 2011. Agreement was almost reached on the cadaster and freedom of movement; the European Union proposed to also tackle the issues of missing people and cultural heritage.
Fifth Round.
The fifth round was set to take place on 14 and 15 June 2011, but was delayed a few days before. It was assumed that it would instead be held in late June, but was then set for 2 July 2011. It was expected that solutions would be reached on the cadaster, freedom of movement and vital records. Electricity and telecommunications issues might also be resolved in that round. Agreement was reached on freedom of movement across the border (both persons and cars), exchange of information regarding Serbia's civil registries to help Kosovo establish its own civil registry, and recognising each other's education diplomas.
Sixth Round.
The sixth round was to take place on 20 and 21 July 2011. They were postponed to September just a day before, allegedly because Kosovo's representative wanted to have Kosovo's state symbols shown, which the Serbian representative rejected. They were later set for 2 September 2011. Agreement was reached on the customs issue (the stamp will only feature the words "Customs of Kosovo") and on the cadaster; while telecommunications and university degrees were also discussed, no agreement was reached on these issues.
Seventh Round.
The seventh round was scheduled for 28 September 2011 (it was initially scheduled for 27 September, but was postponed shortly before due to a flare-up in violence). The Serb delegation refused to continue with the talks under the current circumstances of administrative border setting of Kosovo police and customs, which was not previously agreed and resulted in violence. The talks were then set for 14 October 2011, though only technical issues were planned to be discussed.
Outcome.
Further aims.
It is expected additional agreements to be concluded about:

Verona (Erie Railroad station)

Verona Station was - station on the Caldwell Branch of the Erie Railroad in Verona, New Jersey. The station was originally contstructed in 1891 at the intersection of Depot Street and Personette Street by the Caldwell Railway, which was soon merged into the Erie Railroad system. The station burned down twice: the 1891 station depot burned down in 1905, and the second station survived until 1960, when arsonists destroyed it.. 
However, the freight station built in 1891, a one-room shed, remained standing between both burnings, and although passenger service on the Caldwell Branch ended on October 3, 1966 (and the tracks removed in1979), the freight station in Verona is the only remaining structure left of the entire line. In 2010, the town of Verona proposed to restore the old freight shed, which stands along the right-of-way as a one-room museum. Also that year, the shed was added as the first of Verona's local landmarks by its historical commission.
History.
Early starts for Verona (1891 – 1905).
The first station at Verona was built in 1891 as one of the original stations on the Caldwell Railway, a short branch line off the New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad. When the rail line opened on August 3, 1891, the line served Verona along with Overbrook Hospital (at that point also in Verona) and the neighboring borough of Caldwell. The service on the Caldwell Railway was taken over by the New York & Greenwood Lake in 1896, which was leased by the Erie Railroad a year later. The first station building burned down fourteen years later. The freight station nearby evaded catching fire and did remain in service. When neighboring Caldwell got a new station depot built by the Erie, a team of horses carted the old 1891 station depot through the snow to Verona and installed it as the new station. The relocated station building was a one-story wooden batten depot.
The end of the Caldwell Branch (1966 – 1979).
Change remained slim from 1905 to 1960 in Verona with the daily commuter services from Essex Fells to Jersey City's Pavonia Terminal. In 1960, the station depot moved from Caldwell in 1905 was burned down by arsonists. Rather than building a third station depot, the Erie Railroad, which was experiencing major financial difficulties, put up a three-sided metal shelter for commuters. Once again, the 1891 freight shed survived the passenger station catching fire. By 1962, the station saw only two commuter trains to the new terminus, Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey. To add to the problem, the station lost all passenger service under the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on September 30, 1966 after the Interstate Commerce Commission approved services could be cut on the branches losing money. After serving passengers of Cedar Grove, Verona, Caldwell and Essex Fells for 75 years, the Caldwell Branch was reduced to a costly freight service for companies in Cedar Grove and Verona.
In the summer of 1975, a major weather storm washed away the usability of the tracks of the Caldwell Branch, and although the New Jersey Department of Transportation was willing to put in money for a grant to get the tracks rehabilitated, a lack of interested corporations ended the investment. It ended up the branch would not be absorbed into the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) in 1975, unlike most of the Erie Lackawanna system. On April 1, 1976, the Erie Lackawanna system was absorbed into Conrail. In June 1979, the dormant tracks of the Caldwell Branch were removed from Essex Fells to Great Notch.
Freight station restoration (2010 – present).
On July 12, 2010, the Verona township council named the former freight house the township's first historical landmark. There are plans by the Verona Historical Society to turn the freight house, the sole surviving structure of the Caldwell Branch, into a single room museum and possibly move the shed to a more accessible part of Verona. (The bridge over Runneymede Lane in Essex Fells was demolished in 2000). According to the historical society, the station is in good structural shape.

2011 military intervention in Libya

On 19 March 2011, a multi-state coalition began a military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. The United Nations Intent and Voting was to have "an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to the current attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute crimes against humanity" ... "imposing a ban on all flights in the country’s airspace — a no-fly zone — and tightened sanctions on the Qadhafi regime and its supporters." The resolution was taken in response to events during the Libyan Civil War, and military operations began, with American and British naval forces firing over 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles, the French Air Force, British Royal Air Force, and Royal Canadian Air Force undertaking sorties across Libya and a naval blockade by Coalition forces. Air strikes against Libyan Army tanks and vehicles by French jets were since confirmed. The official names for the interventions by the coalition members are Opération Harmattan by France; Operation Ellamy by the United Kingdom; Operation Mobile for the Canadian participation and Operation Odyssey Dawn for the United States.
From the beginning of the intervention, the initial coalition of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Qatar, Spain, UK and US expanded to nineteen states, with newer states mostly enforcing the no-fly zone and naval blockade or providing military logistical assistance. The effort was initially largely led by France and the United Kingdom, with command shared with the United States. NATO took control of the arms embargo on 23 March, named Operation Unified Protector. An attempt to unify the military command of the air campaign (whilst keeping political and strategic control with a small group), first failed over objections by the French, German, and Turkish governments. On 24 March, NATO agreed to take control of the no-fly zone, while command of targeting ground units remains with coalition forces. The handover occurred on 31 March 2011 at 06:00 UTC (08:00 local time). NATO flew 26,500 sorties since it took charge of the Libya mission on 31 March 2011.
Fighting in Libya ended in late October following the death of Muammar Gaddafi, and NATO stated it would end operations over Libya on 31 October 2011. Libya's new government requested that its mission be extended to the end of the year, but on 27 October, the Security Council voted to end NATO's mandate for military action on 31 October.
Proposal for the no-fly zone.
Both Libyan officials and international states and organizations called for a no-fly zone over Libya in light of allegations that Muammar Gaddafi's military had conducted airstrikes against Libyan rebels in the Libyan civil war.
Enforcement.
Initial NATO planning for a possible no-fly zone took place in late February and early March, especially by NATO members France and the United Kingdom. France and the UK were early supporters of a no-fly zone and have sufficient airpower to impose a no-fly zone over the rebel-held areas, although they might need additional assistance for a more extensive exclusion zone.
The US had the air assets necessary to enforce a no-fly zone, but was cautious to support such an action prior to obtaining a legal basis for violating Libya's sovereignty. However, due to the sensitive nature of military action by the US against an Arab nation, the US sought Arab participation in the enforcement of a no-fly zone.
At a congressional hearing, United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates explained that "a no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defences ... and then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down. But that's the way it starts."
On 19 March, the deployment of French fighter jets over Libya began, and other states began their individual operations. Phase One started the same day with the involvement of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Canada.
On 24 March, NATO ambassadors agreed that NATO would take command of the no-fly zone enforcement, while other military operations remained the responsibility of the group of states previously involved, with NATO expected to take control as early as 26 March. The decision was made after meetings of NATO members to resolve disagreements over whether military operations in Libya should include attacks on ground forces. The decision will create a two-level power structure overseeing military operations. In charge politically will be a committee, led by NATO, that includes all states participating in enforcing the no-fly zone, while NATO alone will be responsible for military action. Royal Canadian Air Force Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard has been appointed to command the NATO military mission.
After the death of Muammar Gaddafi on 20 October 2011, it was announced that the NATO mission would end on 31 October.
Operation names.
Before NATO took full command of operations at 06:00 GMT on 31 March 2011, the military intervention in the form of a no-fly zone and naval blockade was split between different national operations:
Forces committed.
These are the forces committed in alphabetical order.
Reaction.
Since the start of the campaign, there have been allegations of violating the limits imposed upon the intervention by Resolution 1973 and by US law. At the end of May 2011, Western troops were captured on film in Libya, despite Resolution 1973 specifically forbidding "a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory". In the article however, it reports that armed Westerners but not Western troops were on the ground.
On 10 June, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized some of the NATO member nations for their efforts, or lack thereof, to participate in the intervention in Libya. Gates singled out Germany, Poland, Spain, Turkey, and the Netherlands for criticism. He praised Canada, Norway and Denmark, saying that although those three countries had only provided twelve percent of the aircraft to the operation, their aircraft had conducted one-third of the strikes.
On 9 August, the head of UNESCO, Irina Bokova deplored a NATO strike on Libyan State TV, Al-Jamahiriya, that killed 3 journalists and wounded others. Bokova declared that media outlets should not be the target of military activities. On 11 August, after the 9 August NATO airstrike on Majer that allegedly killed 85 civilians, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on all sides to do as much as possible to avoid killing innocent people.
Responsibility to protect.
The military intervention in Libya has been cited by the Council on Foreign Relations as an example of the responsibility to protect policy adopted by the UN at the 2005 World Summit. According to Gareth Evans, "he international military intervention (SMH) in Libya is not about bombing for democracy or Muammar Gaddafi's head. Legally, morally, politically, and militarily it has only one justification: protecting the country's people." However, the Council also noted that the policy had been used only in Libya, and not in countries such as Côte d'Ivoire, undergoing a political crisis at the time, or in response to protests in Yemen. A CFR expert, Stewert Patrick, said that "There is bound to be selectivity and inconsistency in the application of the responsibility to protect norm given the complexity of national interests at stake in...the calculations of other major powers involved in these situations." In January 2012, the Arab Organization for Human Rights, Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and the International Legal Assistance Consortium published a report describing alleged human rights violations and accusing NATO of war crimes.
Criticism.
Some critics of Western military interdiction suggested that resources—not democratic or humanitarian concerns—were the real impetus for the intervention. Gaddafi's Libya, despite its relatively small population, was known to possess vast resources, particularly in the form of oil reserves and financial capital. Libya is a member of OPEC and one of the world's largest oil producers. It was producing roughly 1.6 million barrels a day before the war, nearly 70 percent of them through the state-owned National Oil Corporation. Additionally, the country's sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, was the largest such fund in the world, controlling assets worth approximately US$56 billion, including over 100 tons of gold reserves in the Central Bank of Libya.
Accusations of imperialism on the part of NATO and the West were voiced by many leaders of states that had traditionally aligned themselves with the Communist bloc and subsequently Russia, including: Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei (who said he supported the rebels but not Western intervention), Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez (who referred to Gaddafi as a "martyr"), and President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe (who referred to the Western nations as "vampires"), as well as the governments of Raúl Castro in Cuba, Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, Kim Jong-il in North Korea, Hifikepunye Pohamba in Namibia, and others. Gaddafi himself referred to the intervention as a "colonial crusade ... capable of unleashing a full scale war", a sentiment that was echoed by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin: "[UNSC Resolution 1973] is defective and flawed...It allows everything. It resembles medieval calls for crusades." President Hu Jintao of the People's Republic of China said, "Dialogue and other peaceful means are the ultimate solutions to problems," and added, "If military action brings disaster to civilians and causes a humanitarian crisis, then it runs counter to the purpose of the UN resolution." Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was critical of the intervention as well, rebuking the coalition in a speech at the UN in September 2011. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, despite the substantial role his country played in the NATO mission, also spoke out against getting involved: "I had my hands tied by the vote of the parliament of my country. But I was against and I am against this intervention which will end in a way that no-one knows" and added "This wasn't a popular uprising because Gaddafi was loved by his people, as I was able to see when I went to Libya."
Russia's foreign broadcasting service, RT, has postulated that NATO intervention may have been motivated by Gaddafi's attempts to establish a unified federation of African states that would use the gold dinar as its currency and demand that foreign importers of African oil pay in gold. Despite its stated opposition to NATO intervention, Russia abstained from voting on Resolution 1973 instead of exercising its veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council; four other powerful nations also abstained from the vote—India, China, Germany, and Brazil—but of that group only China has the same veto power.
Moreover, criticisms have been made on the way the operation was led. According to Michael Kometer and Stephen Wright, the outcome of the Libyan intervention was reached by default rather than by design. It appears that there was an important lack of consistent political guidance caused particularly by the vagueness of the UN mandate and the ambiguous consensus among the NATO-led coalition. This lack of clear political guidance was translated into an incoherent military planning on the operational level. Such a gap may impact the future NATO’s operations that will probably face trust issues.
Costs.
On 22 March 2011, BBC News presented a breakdown of the likely costs to the UK of the mission. Journalist Francis Tusa, editor of Defence Analysis, estimated that flying a Tornado GR4 would cost about £35,000 an hour (aprx. $48,000 USD), so the cost of patrolling one sector of Libyan airspace would be £2M –£3M ($2.75M -$4.13M USD) per day. Conventional airborne missiles would cost £800,000 each and Tomahawk cruise missiles £750,000 each. Professor Malcolm Charmers of the Royal United Services Institute similarly suggested that a single cruise missile would cost about £500,000, while a single Tornado sortie would cost about £30,000 in fuel alone. If a Tornado was downed the replacement cost would be upwards of £50m. By 22 March the US and UK had already fired more than 110 cruise missiles. UK Chancellor George Osborne had said that the MoD estimate of the operation cost was "tens rather than hundreds of millions". On 4 April Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton said that the RAF was planning to continue operations over Libya for at least six months.
The cost for Greece was $1 million daily.

The Clearing House Association, LLC is the United States' oldest banking association representing 17 of the world's largest commercial banks, which collectively employ over 2 million people and hold more than half of all U.S. deposits. It is a nonpartisan advocacy organization representing—through regulatory comment letters, amicus briefs and white papers—the interests of its owner banks on a variety of systemically important banking issues. 
Members of The Clearing House include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co. The Clearing House Payments Company, an organization owned by the same banks, was established in New York in 1853 for the purpose of processing transactions among banks. It has offices in New York, North Carolina and Washington, D.C.
In September 2009, the Clearing House joined a lawsuit in support of the Federal Reserve after a federal court in New York ruled against the Fed. Filed by Bloomberg News under the Freedom of Information Act, the lawsuit sought records showing where the Fed had lent $2 trillion of taxpayer funds during the bank bailout of the financial crisis of 2008. The Clearing House has filed an appeal before the United States Supreme Court on October 26, 2010. , the case remains on appeal.
The Clearing House was also sued by the State of New York in Andrew Cuomo v. the Clearing House Association, LLC to determine whether the U.S. Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) had the authority to preempt a state's right to enforce its own fair lending laws against national banks. A 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court overturned previous lower court decisions that had ruled in favor of the Clearing House and the OCC.

Saitama 3rd district (埼玉県第3区 "Saitama-ken dai-sanku" or simply 埼玉3区 "Saitama 3-ku") is a constituency of the House of Representatives in the Diet of Japan. It is located in Southeastern Saitama and consists of the cities of Sōka and Koshigaya. As of 2012, 460,884 eligible voters were registered in the district.
Before the electoral reform of 1994, Sōka was part of the 1st district where three Representatives had been elected by single non-transferable vote, and Koshigaya part of Saitama 4th district (four Representatives).
Between 1996 and 2009, the district had been closely contested between former Sōka mayor Hiroshi Imai (now LDP, Koga faction) who was first elected as JNP candidate from the old 1st district in 1993, and Ex-Socialist Ritsuo Hosokawa (now DPJ, Kan group) who is originally from Kōchi Prefecture but had represented the old 4th district for the JSP since 1990. After his 2009 defeat Imai retired from politics. Hosokawa went on to serve in the DPJ-led cabinets as vice minister and minister. But in the landslide Democratic defeat in 2012, he lost the district to Liberal Democratic newcomer Hitoshi Kikawada and also failed to win a proportional seat.

Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction

In mathematics, the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction or Lyapunov–Schmidt construction is used to study solutions to nonlinear equations in the case when the implicit function theorem does not work. It permits the reduction of infinite-dimensional equations in Banach spaces to finite-dimensional equations. It is named after Aleksandr Lyapunov and Erhard Schmidt.
Problem setup.
Let
be the given nonlinear equation, formula_2 and formula_3 are
Banach spaces (formula_4 is the parameter space). formula_5 is the
formula_6-map from a neighborhood of some point formula_7 to
formula_3 and the equation is satisfied at this point
For the case when the linear operator formula_10 is invertible, the implicit function theorem assures that there exists
a solution formula_11 satisfying the equation formula_12 at least locally close to formula_13.
In the opposite case, when the linear operator formula_10 is non-invertible, the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction can be applied in the following
way.
Assumptions.
One assumes that the operator formula_10 is a Fredholm operator.
formula_16 and formula_17 has finite dimension.
The range of this operator formula_18 has finite co-dimension and
is a closed subspace in formula_3.
Without loss of generality, one can assume that formula_20
Lyapunov–Schmidt construction.
Let us split formula_3 into the direct product formula_22, where formula_23.
Let formula_24 be the projection operator onto formula_25.
Let us consider also the direct product formula_26.
Applying the operators formula_24 and formula_28 to the original equation, one obtains the equivalent system
Let formula_31 and formula_32, then the first equation
can be solved with respect to formula_34 by applying the implicit function theorem to the operator
(now the conditions of the implicit function theorem are fulfilled).
Thus, there exists a unique solution formula_36 satisfying
Now substituting formula_36 into the second equation, one obtains the final finite-dimensional equation
Indeed, the last equation is now finite-dimensional, since the range of formula_40 is finite-dimensional. This equation is now to be solved with respect to formula_41, which is finite-dimensional, and parameters :formula_42

K-independent hashing

A family of hash functions is said to be formula_1-independent or formula_1-universal if selecting a hash function at random from the family guarantees that the hash codes of any designated formula_1 keys are independent random variables (see precise mathematical definitions below). Such families allow good average case performance in randomized algorithms or data structures, even if the input data is chosen by an adversary. The trade-offs between the degree of independence and the efficiency of evaluating the hash function are well studied, and many formula_1-independent families have been proposed.
Introduction.
The goal of hashing is usually to map keys from some large domain (universe) formula_5 into a smaller range, such as formula_6 bins (labelled formula_7). In the analysis of randomized algorithms and data structures, it is often desirable for the hash codes of various keys to "behave randomly". For instance, if the hash code of each key were an independent random choice in formula_8, the number of keys per bin could be analyzed using the Chernoff bound. A deterministic hash function cannot offer any such guarantee in an adversarial setting, as the adversary may choose the keys to be the precisely the preimage of a bin. Furthermore, a deterministic hash function does not allow for "rehashing": sometimes the input data turns out to be bad for the hash function (e.g. there are too many collisions), so one would like to change the hash function.
The solution to these problems is to pick a function "randomly" from a large family of hash functions. The randomness in choosing the hash function can be used to guarantee some desired random behavior of the hash codes of any keys of interest. The first definition along these lines was universal hashing, which guarantees a low collision probability for any two designated keys. The concept of formula_1-independent hashing, introduced by Wegman and Carter in 1981, strengthens the guarantees of random behavior to families of formula_1 designated keys, and adds a guarantee on the uniform distribution of hash codes.
Mathematical Definitions.
The strictest definition, introduced by Wegman and Carter under the name "strongly universalformula_11 hash family", is the following. A family of hash functions formula_12 is formula_1-independent if for any formula_1 distinct keys formula_15 and any formula_1 hash codes (not necessarily distinct) formula_17, we have:
This definition is equivalent to the following two conditions:
Often it is inconvenient to achieve the perfect joint probability of formula_28 due to rounding issues. Following, one may define a formula_29-independent family to satisfy:
Observe that, even if formula_33 is close to 1, formula_34 are no longer independent random variables, which is often a problem in the analysis of randomized algorithms. Therefore, a more common alternative to dealing with rounding issues is to prove that the hash family is close in statistical distance to a formula_1-independent family, which allows black-box use of the independence properties.

Victimless Leather

Victimless Leather – a prototype of a stitch-less jacket, grown from cell cultures into a layer of tissue supported by a coat shaped polymer layer.
This is a sub-project of the Tissue Culture & Art Project where the artists are growing a leather jacket without killing any animals. Growing the victimless leather problematizes the concept of garment by making it semi-living. This artistic grown garment confronts people with the moral implications of wearing parts of dead animals for protective and aesthetic reasons and confronts notions of relationships with manipulated living systems.
__TOC__
Tissue Culture & Art Project.
The SymbioticA website explains what it is, "an artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning, critique and hands-on engagement with the life sciences.". The artists work with tissue, constructing and growing complex organisms that can live outside the body, making the new objects semi-living. Their projects are meant to question life, identity and the relationship between humans and other living beings and environments. They are also interested in the ethics around partial life and the possibilities around this type of technology in the future.
Other projects.
These are some of the sub-projects that are also part of the TC&A project, in addition to Victimless Leather:
NoArk – NoArk is a collection of cells and tissue from many different organisms, growing together inside a "vessel", a reference to Noah's Ark. The project website states that NoArk is "a tangible as well as symbolic ‘craft’ for observing and understanding a biology that combines the familiar with the other".
Worry Dolls – Seven modern versions of the Guatemalan Worry doll were hand-crafted of degradable polymers and surgical sutures and seeded with skin, muscle and bone tissue. The tissue was then allowed to grow inside a bioreactor, replacing the polymers as it degrades, thus creating seven semi-living dolls. 
Disembodied Cuisine – Along with Victimless Leather, this is part of the "Victimless Utopia". The idea for this project was to take cells from a frog and grow them into something possible to eat, displaying it next to the still living frog the food came from. This problemetizes the whole meat industry – how we kill animals to eat them. Growing tissue outside of the body of the animal is a way to "make" meat while the animal stays healthy and living.
Extra Ear – ¼ Scale – Using human tissue, a quarter-scale replica of artist Stelarc's ear was grown. The project wanted to confront the cultural perceptions of life now that we are able to manipulate living systems, and also discuss the notions of the wholeness of the body. 
The Pig Wings Project – This project bases its ideas on xenotransplantation and genetically modifying pigs so their organs can be transplanted to humans. The artists used tissue engineering and stem cell technologies to grow pig bone tissue, forming three different sets of wings. One set shaped as bat wings ("evil"), one as bird wings ("good") and one as pterosaurs wings ("neutral").
The Idea.
An aim for the "Victimless Leather" project is to explore and provoke scientific truths, using conceptual art projects to encourage better understanding of cultural ideas around scientific knowledge. The project website point out how clothing has always been used to protect the fragile skin of humans, but lately have evolved into a fabricated object used as a tool to show one's identity. Based on this, clothing can be explored as a tangible example of the relationship between humans and others, and how humans treat others. As the artists put it: "This particular project will deconstruct our cultural meaning of clothes as a second skin by materialising it and displaying it as an art object." 
The intention to grow artificial leather without killing an animal is meant as a contribution to a cultural discussion between art, science and society. Making this jacket presents a possibility of wearing leather that is not part of a dead animal. The projects are presented in Workshops and exhibitions throughout the world to address ethical questions related to bioscience and technology. The artists want the project to be seen in this cultural context, not a commercial one. Their intention is not to create a consumer product, but to offer a starting point for the cultural discussion points mentioned above. As with most of the TC&A projects the artists are concerned with the relationship between humans and other living systems, both natural and scientific made or manipulated.
The Victimless Leather project.
Growing the jacket.
The artists wanted to make a leather-like material using living tissue, and ended up making it in the shape of a stitchless jacket. The artists based the jacket on a biodegradable polymer, coated it with 3T3 mouse cells to form connective tissue and topped it up with human bone cells in order to create a stronger skin layer. 
To create the victimless leather, the team needed an artificial environment where semi-living entities are grown, so it is grown inside a bioreactor that acts as a surrogate body. The bioreactor used in this project was custom made, based on an organ perfusion pump designed by Alexis Carrel and Charles Lindbergh. It has an automatic dripping system which feeds the cells. The artists assumed that when the polymer degraded, an integrated jacket would appear. The resulting jacket was tiny, about 2 inches high and 1,4 inches wide and would just fit a mouse. 
To idealize the "victimless" of the jacket, immortalized cell lines or cells that divide and multiply forever once they are removed from an animal or human host forming a renewable resource, have been used in the project. The 3T3 mouse cells all come from a mouse who lived in the 1970s.
Research and development.
The research and development of “Victimless Leather” has been conducted in SymbioticA: the Art and Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia and in consultation with Professor Arunasalam Dharmarajan from the School of Anatomy and Human Biology as well as Verigen, a Perth based company that specializes in tissue engineered cartilage for clinical applications. Western Australia state made the investment in the project through ArtsWa in Association with the Lotteries Commission.
Exhibitions.
From a list of selected TC&A exhibitions.
Killing the Jacket.
The victimless leather was featured in the exhibition “Design and the Elastic Mind” at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, USA. [http://www.moma.org/ February 24 – May 12, 2008 The project was scheduled to grow continuously until May 12 when the exhibition ended. There were some problems though, when the leather started expanding too quickly, clogging tubes inside the bioreactor. The exhibition leader therefore decided to unplug the project before the end of the exhibition – in a way, killing it.
Response.
Because the artificial leather is made semi-living, the project might be seen as speculative and provocative to some people – questioning if it is better to kill semi-living beings rather than living beings. "One of the most common and somewhat surprising comments we heard was that people were disturbed by our ethics of using living cells to grow living fabric, while the use of leather obtained from animals seems to be accepted without any concern for the well-being of the animals from which the skin has been removed." artist Ionat Zurr uttered after showing the jacket to the public on "The Space Between" exhibition in Australia.

Related work and ideas.
The project also focuses on human consumption, highlighting that there are victims on every level of it, and that the boundaries between harm and benefit often are blurred. The French actress Brigitte Bardot strongly opposed hunting of animals for vanity and the commercial purpose of the skin. From an indigenous point of view, the context must be seen different. An Inuit hunts the seal and uses the whole body of the animal as a basic resource for his survival.
Similar to ethics like this, is the interest for artificial meat production due to reactions against the livestock sector because of health and environmental problems. A 2006 UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO report pointed out the livestock sector as one of the most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems like soil degradation and water pollution. And because of methane, it spews out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than transportation.

Egypt lobby in the United States

The Egypt lobby in the United States is a collection of lawyers, public relation firms and professional lobbyists paid directly by the government of Egypt to lobby the public and government of the United States on behalf of the interests of the government of Egypt.
A key goal of Egypt's lobbyists is to secure a large allocaton of foreign aid; more than $50 billion in American aid has gone to Egypt since 1975. According to ProPublica, this massive amount of American aid has "enabled" the Egyptian government to postpone democratic reform.
According to ProPublica, in 2007-8 Egypt ranked sixth in a list of the number of meetings between lobbyists for foreign governments and congressmen.
According to the "New York Times", in 2010 three of the most notable lobbyists Tony Podesta, Robert L. Livingston and Toby Moffett scored a large success on behalf of the government of Egypt by persuading American Senators to stop passage of a bill in the United States Senate calling on Egypt to "curtail human rights abuses." Their success is credited with condoning the abuses that brought about the 2011 Egyptian revolution. In the lobbying campaign, former congressman from Connecticut Toby Moffat told his former colleagues that the bill “would be viewed as an insult” and that it would be wrong to insult an important ally. “We were just saying to them, ‘Don’t do this now to our friends in Egypt,’ ” he said. In the wake of President Mubarak's resignation, lobbyists Podesta, Moffat and Livingston continue to share "a joint, multimillion-dollar (lobbying) contract with Egypt."

Henricus Reneri

Henricus Reneri or Renerius (1593, Huy – 20 March 1639, Utrecht) was a Dutch philosopher.
Life.
Reneri was born at Huy in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège in 1593. He studied liberal arts at the University of Leuven and attended the Grand Séminaire of Liège. After his conversion to Calvinism in 1616 he went to the Dutch Republic. He studied theology at the Collège Wallon at Leiden, but he broke off his studies in 1621. The following ten years Reneri worked as a private tutor to the children of several Amsterdam merchant-regents, including Adriaan Pauw. In the meantime he studied medicine at Leiden University. In 1631 he found a position as professor of philosophy at the illustrious school of Deventer, the Illustre Gymnasium. From 1634 he held the same chair at the newly founded illustrious school of Utrecht, which was raised to the status of university in 1636. He died only three years later, at the age of 46.
Reneri mainly taught scholastic logic and natural philosophy. Apart from his professorship, he worked on a method of his own in the Ramist tradition. This method met especially with much enthusiasm within the Hartlib circle, the European network around the English pansophist Samuel Hartlib. Furthermore, Reneri was engaged in experiments and inventions in the fields of optics, thermometers, water clocks, alchemy and natural magic.
Reneri was one of the best friends of René Descartes and an admirer of his philosophy. They met during the winter of 1628-1629 and Descartes followed Reneri to Deventer and Utrecht. Reneri is reported to have read the "Discours de la Méthode" and the accompanying "Essais" (including La Géométrie) publicly in his classes. Nevertheless, Reneri is not to be regarded as a Cartesian philosopher, since his works show little Cartesian influences.
What survives are an inaugural address, several disputations which were presided by him, and a correspondence of more than sixty letters with leading scholars, philosophers, theologians, diplomats and poets from the Republic and abroad, such as André Rivet, Constantijn Huygens, Pierre Gassendi and Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft.

Finnish diaspora

The Finnish diaspora consists of Finnish emigrants and their descendants, especially those that maintain some of the customs of their Finnish culture. Finns emigrated to the United States, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Brazil and Argentina.
The Great Migration.
The years between 1870 and 1930 are sometimes referred as 'the Great Migration' of Finns into North America. In the 1870s, there were only 3,000 migrants from Finland, but this figure was rapidly growing. New migrants often sent letters home, describing their life in the New World, and this encouraged more and more people to leave and try their luck in America. Rumors began of the acres of land that could be cleared into vast productive fields and the opportunity to earn "a barrel of American dollars" in mines, factories, and railroads. There were also professional recruiters, or 'agents', employed by mining and shipping companies, who encouraged Finns to move to the United States. This activity was frowned upon by the authorities of the Grand Duchy, and was mostly done in secret. It was eventually brought to an end in the late 1880s by legislation in the U.S., but the decade still saw a 12-fold increase in the number of Finnish migrants compared to the previous decade, as 36,000 Finns left their home country for North America.

Flint Dille

Flint Dille (born November 3, 1955) is a screenwriter, game designer, and novelist. He is best known for his animated work on "Transformers", "G.I. Joe", ', and his game-writing, ', and "Dead to Rights", as well as his non-fiction book written with John Zuur Platten. 
Personal background.
Dille was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were Robert Crabtree and Virginia Nichols Dille. He attended Glenbrook South High School. In 1977, he graduated from U.C. Berkeley with a Bachelors degree in Ancient History and Classical Rhetoric. He received a Master of Fine Arts in Professional Writing (Cinema) from the University of Southern California. He lives in Los Angeles, California.
Flint Dille is the grandson of John F. Dille, publisher of the original "Buck Rogers" comic strip, and is part of the Dille Family Trust, which owns the rights to the character.
Professional background.
After grad school, Dille worked as a freelance script reader, production assistant, and assistant art director before getting his first writing job from Joe Ruby at Ruby/Spears as a Saturday Morning Development writer. This led to writing scripts for Mr. T., "The Puppy", and "RoboForce". Later, Dille went to work for Sunbow Productions and served in various capacities as Writer, Story Editor, Associate Producer, Co-Producer on several shows, including Transformers (Generation 1), G.I. Joe, "Inhumanoids" and '. After that, Dille worked briefly at CBS on the in-house production of "Garbage Pail Kids", before working with Amblin Entertainment on several projects, including ', "Tiny Toons" (as a movie), and "We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story".
Dille met Gary Gygax, co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons, while Gygax was in Hollwood and they began collaborating on a number of projects, including the "Sagard the Barbarian" gamebook series (1985-1986), which was published by Pocket Books. They also collaborated on "The Sceptre of Seven Souls". Dille co-authored a script with Gygax for a "Dungeons & Dragons" film; however, the film was never made. Dille introduced his siter Lorraine Williams to Gygax at Gygax's request. TSR was having hard times financially, and she was suggested as both a potential investor and as a skilled manager, and she was brought in to TSR as Vice President and Administration. In 1989, TSR made an expansion out to the west coast to get "D&D" back onto the television and into movies; Dille ran this new department, which was called TSR West. Dille was able to get the boardgame "A Line in the Sand" (1991) published the same day the US bombing started in the first Gulf War, as he was able to convince the president of the company to make things move quickly. The Buck Rogers roleplaying game "XXVc" began at TSR West, but Dille could not finish it so it was shipped back east.
For the rest of the 1980s, Dille focused on animation writing and game writing and design. At TSR Dille also worked on Dragonstrike where he wrote and Directed the Video which was an early example of a 'hybrid' film, containing blue screen and digital backgrounds and animation. Dille also directed several audio Interactive discs, including First Quest, , Red Steel and Planescape. The TSR Audio Disc: Terror T.R.A.X: Track of the Vampyre, was later re-done as a CD-ROM by Groliers, directed by Flint Dille and programmed by Peter Marx and Evolutionary Publishing. 
Dille's career shifted to interactive games in the late 80's when he worked on several projects for the Sega CD platform, including Double Switch, Maximum Surge and Corpse Killer. At that point, Dille then worked on Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike for Electronic Arts, writing the videos and completed a transition from paper games and products to video games.
Dille won "Story of the Year" for his work on ' and on "Dead to Rights". Dille was the writer for other video games, including ', "Teen Titans", "Superman Returns", "James Bond: Tomorrow Never Dies", "Soviet Strike", and "Nuclear Strike".
Dille is a close friend of comics creator Frank Miller; "Frank and I met during what I call our 'professional adolescence' when he was doing the Dark Knight and I was doing the Transformers cartoon series," says Dille, "and we've been great friends ever since." Dille was selected to spearhead the design, scriptwriting, story generation, and overall production of a video game adaptation of Miller's "Sin City" for Red Mile Entertainment. Miller planned to direct a "Buck Rogers" film, with Dille as producer, but this project was scrapped in 2009.
Dille co-created and co-executive produced Dimension's 2005 horror film, Venom".
Dille also taught an Alternate Reality Game Design class at UCLA film school, Winter Semester 2011.
Dille co-wrote the "" series of graphic novels with David Marconi, and also the "Buck Rogers XXVC" comic modules "Rude Awakening".
Critical reception.
Regarding Dille's script for "Fievel Goes West", critic Cliff Terry wrote, "Screenwriter Flint Dille has provided a story that is frenetic and fast-paced—in the end, too hyper, too cluttered—with some decidedly dark touches that, conceivably, could have undertones of the Holocaust. To lighten things up, Dille periodically tosses in bits of relatively sophisticated humor. At one point, the desert is described as 'a million-acre catbox,' there are references to espresso and endive, and when Miss Kitty cuts out on Tiger, she purrs—"Casablanca"-like: 'We'll always have the Bronx. Here's lookin' at you, kid.'"

<doc id="31142866" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31142866" title="Muslim campaign at Córdoba Cathedral">
Muslim campaign at Córdoba Cathedral

Since the early 2000s, Spanish Muslims have lobbied the Roman Catholic Church to allow them to pray in the Cathedral of Córdoba. The Muslim campaign has been rejected on multiple occasions, by both Spanish Catholic authorities, and the Vatican.
In 2010 police arrested two Muslim Austrian nationals at the site for a violent incident.
Background.
The building was begun around the year 600 as the Arian Christian Visigothic church of St. Vincent. After the Islamic conquest of the Visigothic kingdom, the church was divided between the Muslims and Christians. When the exiled Umayyad prince Abd ar-Rahman I escaped to Spain and defeated the Andalusian governor Yusuf al-Fihri, he allowed the Christians to rebuild their ruined churches, and purchased the Christian half of the church of St. Vincent.
Abd ar-Rahman I and his descendants reworked it over two centuries to refashion it as a mosque, starting in 784. Additionally, Abd ar-Rahman I used the mosque (originally called Aljama Mosque) as an adjunct to his palace and named it to honor his wife.
Traditionally, the mihrab of a mosque faces in the direction of Mecca; by facing the mihrab, worshipers pray towards Mecca. Mecca is east-southeast of the mosque, but the mihrab points south. 
The mosque underwent numerous subsequent changes: Abd ar-Rahman III ordered a new minaret, while Al-Hakam II, in 961, enlarged the building and enriched the mihrab. The last of the reforms was carried out by Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir in 987. It was connected to the Caliph's palace by a raised walk-way, mosques within the palaces being the tradition for the Islamic rulers of all times. The Mezquita reached its current dimensions in 987 with the completion of the outer naves and courtyard.
The Castillian Reconquest.
In 1236, Córdoba was reconquered by King Ferdinand III of Castile in the Reconquista, and the mosque was turned back into a church. Alfonso X oversaw the construction of the Villaviciosa Chapel and the Royal Chapel within the mosque. The kings who followed added further Christian features, such as King Henry II rebuilding the chapel in the 14th century. The minaret of the mosque was also converted to the bell tower of the cathedral. It was adorned with Santiago de Compostela’s captured cathedral bells.
The most significant alteration was the building of a Renaissance cathedral nave right in the middle of the expansive structure. The insertion was constructed by permission of Charles V, king of Castile and Aragon.
Artisans and architects continued to add to the existing structure until the late 18th century.
Current Muslim campaign.
Muslims across Spain are lobbying the Roman Catholic Church to allow them to pray in the cathedral. The Islamic Council of Spain had lodged a formal request with the Vatican for Muslims to be allowed to pray in the mosque. Spanish church authorities oppose Muslim prayer at the cathedral.
Zakarias Maza, the director of the Taqwa mosque in neighbouring Granada stated in 2004: "We hope the Vatican will give a signal that it has a vision of openness and dialogue. It would be good if there were a gesture of tolerance on their part. The church council doesn't seem to be open to dialogue."
"In no way is this request about reclaiming our rights — far less any kind of reconquest," stated Isabel Romero, a member of the Islamic Council of Spain in 2004. "Instead, we want to give our support to the universal character of this building". Rosa Aguilar, then mayor of Córdoba for the United Left, expressed support for the Islamic Council's position.
On Christmas Day 2006, a Spanish Muslim organisation called the "Spanish Islamic Board", sent a letter to the Pope's ambassador in Spain, asking Pope Benedict XVI for permission for Muslims to worship alongside Christians in the building. The Spanish Muslims wrote in their letter that they did not intend to take control of the building or "recover a nostalgic Al-Andalus". In 2004, the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue had rejected a similar request from the same group. The general secretary of the Spanish Islamic Board, Mansur Escudero, said that security guards often stop Muslim worshippers from praying inside the building.
2010 Muslim tourist violence.
In April 2010, two Muslim tourists were arrested at the cathedral, after an incident in which two security guards were seriously injured. The incident occurred when the building was filled with tourists visiting the cathedral during Holy Week.
According to cathedral authorities, when half a dozen Muslims who were citizens of Austria, who were part of a group of 118 people on an organized tour for young Muslims in Europe, knelt to pray at the same time, security guards stepped in and “invited them to continue with their tour or leave the building”. When two men refused to comply, a scuffle broke out and police were called. Two security guards were seriously injured, and the two Muslim men were detained. Spanish media, citing police sources, said that one of the men arrested had been carrying a knife.
In a statement Catholic authorities condemned the incident: “They provoked in an organized fashion a deplorable episode of violence.” After the 2010 incident, Spain's Catholic clergy reiterated that they would not be allowing any other religions to practice inside their Catholic Cathedral. Catholic authorities stated that "This one-off incident does not represent the genuine attitude of Muslims, many of whom maintain an attitude of respect and dialogue with the Catholic church".

KV Pharmaceutical

KV Pharmaceutical Company (KV) is an American drug company that brings generic and non-branded pharmaceutical products to the market. Headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, it has research and manufacturing facilities, as well as marketing and sales operations, the latter activities conducted through its subsidiaries, Ther-Rx Corporation and Nesher Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Background.
KV was founded by Victor Hermelin in 1942 who ran the company until 1975, when he was replaced by his son Marc. Marc Hermelin was ousted in 2008 when an FDA inspection took place. The following year KV convicted of felony charges for the "making, marketing, and distribution of adulterated and unapproved drugs" was shut down by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After a proxy fight, M. Hermelin returned to the company's board. Between 2008 and 2010, KV lost three-quarters of its workforce, down to 350. KV was reapproved for manufacturing drugs in 2010, while its "Ethex" manufacturing subsidiary was sold.
Rather than developing new molecular entities, KV researches different modes of drug delivery. It developed bioadhesive drug delivery where molecules adhere to wet sites such as a mucosa (example Clindesse), and is investigating quick-dissolving and controlled-release drug venues.
Makena pricing controversy.
In February 2011, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval to KV for "Makena" (17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate or 17OHPC) for the prevention of premature birth in women with a single fetus of less than 37 weeks gestation who had at least one previous preterm birth. For many years, however, 17OHPC had been available and used by obstetricians "off label". Prior to the release of Makena, the drug was made available by pharmacies that compounded the agent for $15 or less per injection (typically 15 to 20 injections are given over a treatment course). With the FDA approval of Makena as an orphan drug, KV received the exclusive right to sell the drug for seven years. KV boosted its price by a factor of 100, to $1,500 per injection, or about $25,000 per treatment.
The pricing policy of KV was heavily criticized as it substantially increased medication cost and removed less expensive alternatives. KV indicated that the cost of taking care of a premature birth is about $51,000 justifying the cost of the medication, further, a system would be in place to enable patients without means to obtain the medication. Thus, expenses would essentially fall on the public sector and insurance carriers. A number of physician organizations have opposed the pricing policy of the company as did the March of Dimes that supported the arrival of Makena. The FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg stated that the agency was not in a position to influence pricing. Concerned about price gouging, two Senators, Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) indicated that they plan to initiate hearings with the Federal Trade Commission about KV's conduct. The controversy spawned protests like the "Shame on You KV Pharmaceutical and CEO Greg Divis" Facebook page.
By the end of March the FDA announced that pharmacies compounding the drug independently will not face legal reprisal, thus enabling the price of the drug to remain in the $10-20 range. After this announcement, K-V's stock dropped by more than 60% on March 30, 2011, and the company cut the price of Makena to $690 per dose.

Marguerite de Rothschild

Marguerite de Rothschild, duchesse de Gramont (Frankfurt, 19 September 1855Paris, 25 July 1905), was the daughter of Baron Mayer Carl von Rothschild (1820–1886) (Naples branch; son of Carl Mayer von Rothschild) and Louise Rothschild (1820–1894) (London branch; daughter of Nathan Mayer Rothschild).
Margaretha's father disapproved of her marrying a Catholic, the comte de Liedekerke, and her conversion to Catholicism and withdrew her from his will. Soon after her marriage, Count de Liedekerke died at a hunting party. She remarried with Agénor, 11th "duc de Gramont" (then "duc de Guiche") in 1878 who was the son of Agénor de Gramont, an ex-ambassador of Emperor Napoleon III. Baron Carl Meyer von Rothschild refused to attend the wedding, because he had preferred his daughter to marry her cousin Edmond de Rothschild, and not a non-Jew.
The will of her father was revoked and she received her inheritance at her father's death, in 1886, which was enormous. The Duke and Duchess de Gramont lived in their "hôtel particulier" on the Champs Élysées where she would give parties for the cream of the aristocracy, and at their "château de Vallière", near Paris.
They had three children:

Larochette Castle

Larochette Castle (Luxembourgish: "Buerg Fiels", German: "Burg Fels", French: "Château de Larochette") stands high above the town of Larochette in central Luxembourg. Dating from the 11th century, the castle was destroyed by fire at the end of the 16th century. Since its acquisition by the State of Luxembourg in 1979, some restoration work has been undertaken. 
Location.
The castle ruins are located on a promontory some 150 metres above the White Ernz which runs through the small town of Larochette. The access road crosses a large farmyard with fortified earthworks. The main building is surrounded by a wall, now partly destroyed. A deep ditch divides the castle into two parts. At the far end of the promontory, the remains of several manor houses attest to the high quality of the architecture and its rather pompous style.
History.
The earliest references to the castle are from the end of the 11th century and during the 12th century when the lords of Larochette were flag bearers for the counts of Luxembourg. The family proliferated leading to the construction of the five stately houses which are separate from the main structure. They include the Homburg Manor (1350) and the Créhange Manor (1385) both of which have now been restored. The "Verlorenkost" (literally Lost Food) watchtower also stands alone on the south side. The legend goes that the cook was carrying pots full of food when she stumbled, breaking everything. 
The Créhange manor now contains period artwork. There is a well inside which also has its legend, telling how the lady of the castle jumped into the well with her child while the castle was under attack. After rescuing the brave woman, the invaders accused the steward of the castle of treason and threw him into the well. It is said that he reappears every Good Friday in the form of a dragon.
Visiting times.
The castle is open to the public from Easter until the end of October, every day from 10 am to 6 pm.

Dark Souls (film)

Dark Souls (Norwegian: Mørke sjeler) is a Norwegian horror film, written and directed by César Ducasse and Mathieu Péteul. It premiered in Norway on January 14, 2011.
Plot.
A young girl, Johanna (Johanna Gustavsson), is jogging alone in the woods when she is suddenly attacked and seemingly murdered by a mask-wearing maniac with a power drill.
Later that same day, her father Morten (Morten Rudå) receives a phone call from the police pronouncing her dead just as he sees her walk in the front door of their house. Morten tells the police that his daughter is completely fine and sitting in front of him.
But strange things soon begin to happen to Johanna; she is disorientated and becomes pale and unresponsive. She is in a zombie-like state, not uttering a word and with difficulties walking and eating, but most noticeably she constantly vomits a strange black substance.
Johanna is admitted to the hospital where the doctors find a strange tumor in her head and surgery is needed right away, although the doctors can’t guarantee she will survive the operation. But Morten refuses and takes his daughter home where he cares for her twenty four hours a day.
Similar attacks begin to happen in the area and new victims are found by the police who have no leads in these bizarre cases, except the fact that most of the victims have been drilled in the head and end as walking dead, vomiting black bile.
Johanna’s father takes it on himself to find out the truth. He embarks on a dark thrill ride of lost memories, conspiracy and zombie-like symptoms. Finding the mysterious darkness within is the source of the bizarre world he has uncovered.

Conygar Hillfort

Conygar Hillfort is a small multivallate Iron Age hill fort in the North Somerset district of Somerset, England. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.
The hill fort is situated approximately south from the village of Portbury near Bristol and the M5.
The fort is triangular in shape and there are the remains of a high bank on the south-western side.
Background.
Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ores necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated "forts provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress an increasing population burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction".

Giles Firman Phillips

Giles Firmin Phillips (1780–1867) was an English artist and author. He painted landscapes and river scenes, primarily of the river Thames. His paintings were exhibited, among other venues, at the Royal Academy from 1836 - 1858. He is the author of several books on painting and lithography.
Biography.
Phillips was born in 1780, the youngest child of John and Dorothy Phillips (sometimes spelled Philips). Nothing is known about Giles’ childhood and adolescence. There is also no indication of why or how he became an artist. He was not taught at the Royal Academy Schools.
The first record of his artistic inclination is his engraving of Lady Eliza Wrixon-Becher, a celebrated actress of the time, which was published by A. Beugo in 1815 when Giles was 35 years old. Another engraving, this time of Sarah Siddons, was published, also by A. Beugo, in 1825. During the latter years Giles was moving fairly frequently. There are records of his insurance policies, taken out with the Sun Fire Office in the early 1820s which show him living at 4, Craven Street, City Road in 1822 and 35, Tavistock Street, Covent Garden by 1825, and described as an engraver. By 1827 he was living at 16 Brownlow Street, off High Holborn, and he is described as a “Drawing Master” in the directories of the time. His son John was also living with the family at the time.
He was a founder member of the New Watercolour Society (founded 1831, and renamed "The Institute of Painters in Watercolours" in 1863.) He joined in 1832 soon after its foundation, and was on the committee of Management in 1833, for a year. He was also a professional subscriber in 1834, but according to the catalogues was neither a member nor exhibitor after 1835.
He was described as an eccentric old watercolour painter, well known in his day.
Phillips married Lydia Arnold on June 11, 1800. They are the parents of author/illustrator John Phillips.
According to his death certificate, Phillips died on March 31, 1867 in Islington. He was buried at the Holy Trinity Church, East Finchley.
Phillips is also the great-great-great grandfather of musician and landscape painter Steve Phillips (musician).
Published books.
Giles Phillips wrote five books, one on Lithography, and four on the Techniques of Painting, which were published between 1828 and 1840.

Men's Light-Contact at WAKO World Championships 2007 Belgrade -69 kg

The men's 69 kg (151.8 lbs) Light-Contact category at the W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Belgrade was the third lightest of the male Light-Contact tournaments falling in between the welterweight and light middleweight divisions when compared to Low-Kick and K-1's weight classes. There were twenty-two men from three continents (Europe, Africa and South America) taking part in the competition. Each of the matches was three rounds of two minutes each and were fought under Light-Contact rules. 
Due to an unequal number of competitors for a tournament designed for thirty two contestants, nine of the men had a bye through to the second round. The tournament gold medallist was Poland's Przemyslaw Ziemnicki who won the tournament without having to fight in the final as both his potential opponents, Russia's Evgeny Mayer and Hungary's László Szabó were disqualified in their semi final match. This meant that there was no silver medal winner in the category and only one bronze, which went to Ziemnicki's semi final opponent - Croatian Dejan Cepic.

Andrena hattorfiana

Andrena hattorfiana is a species of "mining bees" belonging to the family Andrenidae subfamily Andreninae.
Description.
The adults grow up to long. They have a black-brown body with sparse light hair, while the first and the second abdominal segment are reddish. The females have a pollen basket of curved hairs on the sides of the thorax.
Behavior.
"Andrena hattorfiana" is an "oligolectic species", feeding its young only on pollen of a few species of Dipsacaceae (Knautia arvensis, Scabiosa columbaria, Centaurea species). It is a solitary bee that can be seen easily from up to 5 meters away. It can be encountered from May through August.
The females usually lay eggs in a nest excavated by themselves in sandy soils. Nest has five to ten brood cells, each having one egg and one pollen pollen as food for the larvae. Every day there is one offspring produced in good weather conditions for foraging, and five to ten in a lifetime. These nests are made in dry parts of a traditionally managed hay field in medium pressure horse-graze pastures with sparse vegetation and on human-trampled paths.
These bees relies heavily on pollen, that is almost like a species saving resource. The critical pollen resource for 10 reproducing A. hattorfiana ♀ varied from 27 to 361 plant individuals. Therefore, being able to get pollen from only one flower may have helped lead this species to the endangerment of being extinct.
Distribution.
This endangered solitary bee is present in most of Europe and in the Near East. Its is mainly found in Sweden but is threatened in several European countries. The overall population sizes of this bee are small.
With the specific conditions in which a nest must be made could have aided in bringing this species closer to being endangered of being extinct. Furthermore this species is endangered as these bees are often infected by a host specific cleptoparasite called "Nomada armata" which parasitizes a big proportion of brood cells in local populations. Other factors are the competition for pollen by other insects, and habitat loss and fragmentation. But the main reason is the reduced food-plant distribution because of larger farm units and not a lot of traditionally managed meadows.
Therefore, "Andrena hattorfiana" is endangered because of pollen competition, not enough variability in their habitat, and because of there not being enough traditionally managed meadows.

New Ditch

New Ditch is a linear earthwork of possible Iron Age or Medieval construction. It partially crosses the Polden Hills in woodlands approximately south-west from the village of Butleigh in Somerset, England. 
Its construction is similar to Ponter's Ball Dyke 3 miles to the northeast, with the dyke on the south east of the embankment, but of less massive construction. Both were probably part of a more extensive defence scheme. It is nearly half a mile in length and was probably of greater extent originally, but as it stands, New Ditch cannot be termed a cross-ridge dyke although it does seem to be a boundary work. 
It is debatable whether this site is ancient because it is located close to a medieval woodland and a deer park.

Cambodian Self Help Demining

Cambodian Self Help Demining (CSHD) is a nonprofit NGO founded by Aki Ra in Cambodia. Its mission is to clear landmines and UXOs in 'low priority' villages throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia. Low priority villages are often villages in remote area with limited traffic and populated by poor farmers. Hence, they do not receive priority from mine clearance projects and are at times overlooked.
Efforts and Funding.
The development problems that Cambodia faces with regard to landmines are enormous. The CSHD helps to solve some of the problems, such as rural poverty, by giving the people access to previously hazardous land that can be used for farming, houses and schools to improve their standard of living. In 2010, CSHD cleared seven villages, removed 150 mines and UXOs and put 4,695 people back on previously mine-contaminated land. They also helped to build and support two village schools and paid the teacher’s salaries. 
CSHD has set up a Landmine Relief Fund to support the demining process. The main aim of the Fund is to seek contributions from external organizations to finance the cost required to maintain the demining team. It costs approximately $9,000USD per month to maintain a demining team in the field, with the deminers paid up to $250USD per month. In 2011, CSHD had only 1 demining team, comprising 18 deminers working in the field and 7 support staff. It has been a continuing challenge for CSHD to raise funds.
Affiliates.
Besides actively carrying out demining work in the field, Cambodian Self Help Demining also cares for the children living at the Landmine Museum Relief Center; a home to children who have been affected by the landmines and have no one else to take care of them. Their mission is to provide education and support for children at risk. The provision of shelter and education for these children allows them to have a higher standard of living, with education providing employment opportunities in the future.

James &amp; Frederick Howard

James & Fred Howard of Bedford, later known simply as Howards, were one of the smaller English makers of agricultural machinery and steam traction engines. At The Great Exhibition of 1851 they exhibited a range of horse-drawn implements. After World War I, Howards became part of AGE, Agricultural & General Engineers, along with many of the other British makers of similar machinery.
Traction engines.
Howard traction engines are recognisable by their distinctive placement of their steam engine "behind" the boiler, rather than on top as for the far more common overtype. This gives them an unusually long and low appearance, with the flywheel set particularly low. This also requires the provision of a steam dome atop the boiler, an unusual arrangement for an English engine. Although usually plain in appearance and painted black, with little ornamentation compared to the later Edwardian engines, Howards carried very large brass nameplates on their boiler sides and smokebox door reading ""James & Fredk Howard. Bedford. England"".
They also built ploughing engines. Unlike the better-known Fowlers, the Howard used a pair of winding drums. This allowed a single engine and an anchored return pulley to plough, rather than the Fowler system that used a pair of engines, each one pulling alternately. The two drums were too large to fit in the usual position beneath the boiler and so were moved to a horizontal axle behind the engine's scuttle, with a pair of sheaves beneath the boiler to guide the cables.

Amalia Küssner Coudert

Amalia Küssner Coudert (March 26, 1863 – May 1932) was an American miniaturist known for her portraits of prominent figures of the late 19th century including Caroline Astor, King Edward VII, Czar Nicholas II of Russia and Cecil Rhodes.
Early life.
Coudert was born on March 26, 1863, in Greencastle, Indiana, to Lorenz and Emilie (Weinhardt) Küssner. On February 24, 1864, the family, including Amalia's siblings Albert and Louisa, moved to Terre Haute, Indiana. Her father, a German immigrant, ran a musical instrument repair shop called Küssner's Palace of Music at 213 Ohio Street. Lorenz gave his daughter a miniature portrait on ivory when Coudert was 12 years old, and she soon began painting her own miniatures. Coudert enjoyed etching the local scenery and soon began etching on ivory, often from the discarded piano keys of damaged pianos.
Coudert graduated from Terre Haute High School in 1881. She then studied with artist Sister Maurice Schnell at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods Academy. From 1883 to 1885 Coudert studied in New York, but in 1885 she returned to Terre Haute, where she established a studio and studied under tutor Helen Minshall.
Professional life.
's typical miniature portraits were painted on small ivory discs 2-3 inches in diameter. In all, she completed more than 200 of these miniatures.
Her earliest portraits were during her time in Terre Haute, where she painted likenesses of local families including the Fairbanks, Minshalls, Bakers and Reynolds.
New York City.
By 1892 Coudert had moved to New York City with the recommendation of school friend and successful actress Alice Fischer. She maintained a studio in the Windsor Hotel and painted portraits of Manhattan's elite, including Caroline Astor, at approximately US $1,000 per portrait. During these period a "Harper's Bazaar" writer profiled her luxuriously decorated studio and described Coudert as a 22-year-old child prodigy, even though she was 31 years old at the time. (Coudert did nothing to correct this error, in fact encouraging those who saw her as "girl artist." For years, she continued to claim her age was a full decade younger than was true.)
Paintings of royalty.
Coudert traveled to Europe in the late 1890s under the patronage of socialite Minnie Paget. She was welcomed by high society there and soon became known for her portraits of royalty, including King Edward VII, Czar Nicholas II of Russia and his wife Alexandra. At her height, Coudert's works earned her as much as US $4,000 per portrait.
Marriage.
On July 4, 1900, she married Charles duPont Coudert, a wealthy international lawyer, in a surprise ceremony attended only by their mothers. The New York Times society page reported that this "hasty wedding ... made quite a little stir." The couple traveled throughout Europe and maintained a mansion in New York.
Though a New York Times article in 1901 claimed that Coudert was "meeting with great success" in London, for the most part her career dwindled after her marriage. By 1914 Coudert was retired and was living with her husband in Windlesham Hall, a Tudor castle the couple had purchased in Surrey, England.
The couple owned at least one piece of art; in 1911 Coudert lent a Pierre Puvis de Chavannes painting titled "Child Gathering Apples" to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Legacy.
Coudert's miniatures are now in the collections of several museums, including the Swope Art Museum and the Cincinnati Art Museum.
In addition to her paintings, Coudert is remembered for a 1906 article she wrote for "The Century Magazine" about her experience painting Nicholas II and Alexandra of Russia in March 1899. In significant detail, Coudert describes the royal lodgings, her interactions with the royal family and staff, and the process of painting their portraits, giving a rare glimpse into the personal lives of the family.

Vivian Dering Majendie

Colonel Sir Vivian Dering Majendie KCB, CB, RA (1836 – 1898) was one of the first bomb disposal experts and Chief Inspector of Explosives to Queen Victoria from 1871 until his death in 1898.
Biography.
The son of Major John Routledge Majendie (1801-1850) and his wife Harriet Mary Dering (1806-1893), and the grandson of Henry Majendie, the Bishop of Bangor, Vivian Majendie was educated at Leamington College before joining the Royal Artillery in 1854. Promoted to Second Lieutenant on 23 October 1854, he saw action during the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. From 1861 to 1871 Majendie served as Captain Instructor and Assistant Superintendent at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. In 1871 he was appointed Chief Inspector of Explosives, a position he held until his death in 1898. He was the President of the Association of Mining Engineers and was one of the first bomb disposal experts. 
As a Major in the Royal Artillery Majendie investigated an explosion on 2 October 1874 in the Regent's Canal when the barge 'Tilbury', carrying six barrels of petroleum and five tons of gunpowder blew up, killing the crew and destroying Macclesfield Bridge and cages at nearby London Zoo. He was appointed a Companion of the Bath (CB) in 1875 for framing a Bill which became 'The Explosives Act, 1875', and KCB in 1895. His advice during the Fenian dynamite campaign of 1881-85 was officially recognised as having contributed to the saving of lives. After Victoria Station was bombed on 26 February 1884 he defused a bomb with a clockwork mechanism which might have gone off at any moment.
In October 1886 Majendie visited the United States to observe the petroleum industry there and to examine the regulations regarding storage and distribution of that product. A caricature of Majendie by Leslie Ward ('Spy') appeared in "Vanity Fair" on 23 April 1892. His publications included "Up Among the Pandies" (1859), "Ammunition. A Descriptive Treatise on the Different Projectiles, Charges, Fuses, Rockets, &c." (1867), "The Arms and Ammunition of the British Service" (1868), and "The Official Guide to the Explosives Act" (1877).
Majendie married Adelaide Frances Grylls (1841-1866) and had two children, a daughter and Captain Henry Grylls Majendie (1865-1900) who was killed during the Boer War while serving with the Rifle Brigade.
Vivian Dering Majendie died of heart failure in 1898 while visiting his sister in Oxford.

Brugse Vrije

The Brugse Vrije was a castellany in the county of Flanders, often called in English 'the Franc of Bruges'. It included the area around Bruges, and was bordered by the North Sea, the Westerschelde and the Yser river. The city of Bruges was separated from the castellany in 1127. Since then the city and the Vrije were considered as separate common law areas. The Brugse Vrije was a rich agricultural region. It had its own burgrave, who was seated at the Burg, a square in Bruges, and became part of the "Four Members of Flanders" at the end of the 14th century, together with the three major cities of Ghent, Brugge and Ypres. The Brugse Vrije sat in the meetings of the States of Flanders. 
Organisation.
The castellany of Bruges was founded at around the year 1000 under the rule of Count Baldwin IV of Flanders (980–1035) as part of the county of Flanders. The head of the castellany was a burgrave, who represented the Count of Flanders. The burgrave was replaced by a bailiff in the 12th century. The fief was first called the "Castellany of Bruges", but later took on the name "Brugse Vrije". In Middle Ages it was divided into Amts.
The Manor.
The governing body of the Brugse Vrije was located at the Burg, the square in Bruges where both the civil and eclessiastical administration were located. Initially the Vrije was seated next to "the stone", on the west side of the Burg. In the 15th century, the Vrije moved to the other side, where it took over a portion of the count's former court, the Dukes of Burgundy having moved their residence to the newly built Prinsenhof. In 1434–1440 the Vrije added a tribunal to the southern side, facing towards Groenerei, a canal in Bruges. In 1520–1525, the complex was extended along the row with a new high tribunal, the aldermen's chamber and an entrance-hall. The architect was Jan van de Poele. A gallery with high arches was built on the Burg-side in 1528–1532. In 1606–1607, a chapel was added next to the aldermen's chamber and in 1664–1666 an "orphan room", in which records of the castellany's orphans were kept. The still existing façades on the Groenerei side was built at this time. Lastly, the part of the manor that is visible on the Burg, and which was significantly enlarged by the purchase of the "Love" in 1555, was rebuilt in 1722–1727 in the Neoclassical style after a design by Jan Verkruys.
The now classified as heritage (1938) building still exists in this form and was used from 1795 to 1984 as a courthouse. Now the building on the Burg houses the city archives, with the reading room located in the chapel. Next to the old Court of Justice lies the renaissance hall. Located in this former aldermen's chamber of the old Palace of the Brugse Vrije, is the monumental 16th-century Emperor-Charles-fireplace, made of oak wood, alabaster and marble, designed by Lanceloot Blondeel.

Titian Self-Portrait (drawing)

The drawing is clearly related to the profile self-portrait in the Prado, although in reverse, facing to the right. The self-portrait in profile was unusual in the sixteenth century, partly due to the difficult of setting up the various mirrors need to execute it, but the choice of this format wasn’t a casual one: the idea of immortality which was associated with the profile view. Established in ancient numismatic portraiture and revived in the renaissance medal, the profile carried with it implications of monumentality, of permanent commemoration, but also of the mythic origins of the art itself in the drawn outline.
By the 1540s Titian himself had already been so figured in medals, his face cast in profile. Particularly intriguing is an image datable to the early 1560s, a profile portrait of the painter holding an image of his son Orazio, known in a medal attributed to Agostino Ardenti and in a richly ornamented colored wax medallion. Titian, then, had often seen himself in profile; his aquiline nose and pointed beard had became public features of his persona.
One other aspect of the profile is the author portrait as a frontispiece of the printed book. Related to and inspired by the commemorative medals, a model for such effigies was actually established by Titian, who designed the woodcut portrait of Ludovico Ariosto that opened the definitive edition of the Orlando Furioso, published in 1532. It seems quite possible that the drawing served as a modello for the Prado self-portrait, for a medal or for a frontespice. This little self-portrait, black chalk on ivory paper 120mm x 99mm, was drawn around 1562-1570.
The drawing, currently in a private collection, in 2007 was included in Belluno international exhibition Tiziano L’ultimo Atto as Titian self-portrait.
In 2009 Professor David Rosand wrote an article on Artibus et Historiae, where he suggests that the drawing is indeed the work of the master himself.

Visual rhetoric and composition

In the field of Composition Studies, the place of visual rhetoric is often uncertain or contested. Proponents of its inclusion in composition typically point to the increasingly visual nature of society, and the increasing presence of visual texts. Literacy, they argue, can no longer be limited only to written text and must also include an understanding of the visual. The exact role of visual rhetoric in the composition classroom, however, is unclear.
Despite this focus on new media, the inclusion of visual rhetoric in composition studies is distinct from a media theory of composition, though the two are obviously related. Visual rhetoric focuses on the rhetorical nature of all visual texts while new media tends to focus on electronic mediums.

Straight to You Tour

The Straight to You Tour is the fourth concert tour by American recording artist Josh Groban. Visiting North America, Europe and Africa, the tour will support Groban's fifth studio album, "Illuminations".
Background.
The tour was announced by Reprise Records on Valentine's Day 2011. Initially with only three dates, many fans speculated Groban was expanding his intimate tour. Upon his 30th birthday, Groban posted a video on his Tumblr blog stating the tour's expansion in North America with additional dates in England. This is later followed by a posting on his official website with a detailed itinerary of the tour. During an interview with Gayle King, Groban mentions he still worries from time to time about his career. He further states given the current atmosphere in the entertainment industry, Groban is always worried about how the media and fans will approach an experimental sound and production. To prepare for the tour, the singer embarked on a mini tour of the United States playing theaters and concert halls. The nine city tour, entailed "Before We Begin", gave the opportunity for Groban to perform in an intimate setting and connect with the audience in new ways. Groban wants to continue the intimate theme even though he will play arenas.
To introduce the tour, Live Nation stated: "The "Straight To You" Tour will bring the feel of a theater experience to an arena setting though stage design, lighting, and projection, as well as through spontaneity and interactivity. Groban delighted his fans during last year’s 'Before We Begin' shows, in which he solicited feedback from the audience on which songs should be included in the set-list. As a result, for the 'Straight To You' shows, Groban will continue to interact with audiences and perform favorites from his best-selling albums, including his "self-titled debut", "Closer", and "Awake", as well as songs from "Illuminations"."
Setlist.
The following songs were performed at the Toyota Center in Houston, TX. It does not represent all songs performed on tour.

Fuduntu

Fuduntu Linux was a Fedora-based Linux distribution created by Andrew Wyatt. It is designed to fit in somewhere between Fedora and Ubuntu (hence the name), and, while optimized for netbooks and other portable computers, it is a general-purpose OS.
After forking Fedora 14 in early November 2011, Fuduntu became an independent distribution and is no longer considered a "remix" of Fedora; it never qualified as a "spin" because it contained packages not included in Fedora.
On a Team Meeting held on April 14 2013, it was decided that Fuduntu would discontinue development and no new versions will be released. Large parts of the team were planning to work on a new rebased OS, most likely with a new name.
On April 28, 2013 the Fuduntu website officially informed that the project has come to an end and that users may want to switch to the new project Cloverleaf Linux which is based on openSUSE instead.
On September 25th, the developer team have decided to stop making Cloverleaf too, due to lack of manpower, as well as due to image leaks and other issues regarding source code for KDE's upcoming lightweight desktop environment KlyDE, which in term was supposed to be used as Cloverleaf's default desktop environment. Later, their blog went down.
Features.
As Fuduntu was originally targeted at the Asus Eee PC and other netbooks, it contains some tweaks to reduce power consumption. Among them, the /tmp and /var/log directories have been moved to RAM disk, and swappiness has been reduced to 10, to reduce the frequency of disk spin-up. In addition, Fuduntu includes the Jupiter power management applet (also developed by Andrew Wyatt), for easy adjustment of CPU performance settings, screen output and resolution, etc.
The default packages include Nautilus Elementary, Adobe Flash, the Fluendo MP3 Codec, VLC, Infinality Freetype, LibreOffice, and the nano editor.
Look and Feel.
The used icon theme is called "Faenza Cupertino". It features the distinctive square icon set of Faenza. Because it was originally based on Fedora and Ubuntu it has GNOME as window manager, giving the opportunity to change themes, including window frames.

Libya lobby in the United States

The Libya lobby in the United States is a collection of lawyers, public relation firms and professional lobbyists paid directly by the government of Libya to lobby the public and government of the United States on behalf of the interests of the government of Libya.
The Libyan government has engaged a number of American firms who have disclosed their work under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, including White & Case, Blank Rome, The Livingston Group, and Monitor Group. In 2008, law firm White & Case gave Libya “a special 15 percent discount off of our standard rates” in its effort to cement a “significant relationship" with the Libyan government under led by Muammar Gaddafi. In 2008 and 2009, the Gaddafi government paid over $2 million to lobbyists White and Case, Blank Rome, and The Livingston Group, led by Former Congressman Bob Livingston, to lobby on their behalf.
Monitor Group was hired in 2005 to assess the state of Libya’s economy, develop plans for economic modernization and reform of the banking system, and train leaders from different sectors of society. The work did not involve any wider political reforms in the North African nation. According to a 2007 memo from Monitor to Libya's intelligence chief which was subsequently obtained by the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition and posted on the internet in 2009, Monitor entered into further contracts with the Libyan regime in 2006 which were worth at least $3m (£1.8m) per year plus expenses. According to the memo these contracts were for a campaign to "enhance international understanding and appreciation of Libya... emphasize the emergence of the new Libya... introduce Muammar Qadhafi as a thinker and intellectual." Monitor’s work became the subject of controversy with the onset of the Libyan civil war. In March 2011 Monitor announced that it had launched an internal investigation into its work for the Libyan government and in May 2011 registered past work in Libya.

Bettini v Gye

Bettini v Gye (1876) 1 QBD 183 is an English contract law case, concerning the right to terminate performance of a contract.
Facts.
Mr Bettini agreed with Frederick Gye that he would not sing anywhere within fifty miles of London except at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden (now the Royal Opera House), from 1 January to 1 December, and would perform for him from 30 March to 13 July 1875 for £150 per month. Bettini was supposed to perform concerts or operas. Importantly, Bettini was meant to be in London ‘without fail’ 6 days before rehearsals, but did not arrive until 28 March, at which point he was ready to perform. However, Gye rejected Bettini’s performance.
Judgment.
Blackburn J held the provision for arriving 6 days before was not a condition, and therefore breach of it did not give rise to the right to terminate. If clear words had stipulated that in the event Mr Bettini did not show up Gye could terminate, or that Bettini would forfeit twice his salary, that would provide the answer. Here Bettini had already performed his covenant to not sing in the UK in the months running up to 30 March, and not showing for rehearsals could only affect theatrical performances and singing in duets during the first week or fortnight. So the breach did not go to the root of the contract, and Gye was not entitled to terminate.

Gwalior Star

The Gwalior Star is a campaign award presented to the soldiers of the British Army, by the Honorable East India Company, who took part in the 1843 Gwalior Campaign. 
History.
On December 29, 1843, the British Army defeated Maharaja Mahadji Rao Scindia, and regained control of Gwalior. The first division of the army, commanded by Sir Hugh Gough, was victorious at the Battle of Maharajpoor. Major-General Grey, on the same day, with the second division, was victorious at the Battle of Punniar.
Description.
This medal is a six pointed star made of bronze, from guns captured during the Gwalior Campaign. In the center of the star is a silver disk, which bears the Date 29th Dec, 1843 and the name of one of the Gwalior Campaign battles, either Maharajpoor or Punniar. The reverse of the medal is plain and engraved with the name of the soldier, to whom the medal was awarded, and the soldier's regiment. Manufactured at the Calcutta Mint, this medal was presented by the British India Government originally as a star with a clip on the back to be worn on the breast. Eventually most of these were fitted with a ring so that they could be suspended by a ribbon and worn along with other medals. The ribbon used was the common ribbon used on many East India Company medals, which was a blue-white-yellow-red gradient ribbon such as that found on the Candahar, Ghuznee, Cabul Medal.

He was educated at the "Lycée" in Versailles and studied law before breaking off his studies to devote himself to political activism. In 1866 he was imprisoned for the first time for sedition. Around this time he became involved in the clandestine revolutionary societies organised by the followers of the incarcerated veteran insurrectionist Louis-Auguste Blanqui. Together with Gustave Tridon, Émile Eudes and others, Granger plotted the overthrow of the Second French Empire. On August 14, 1870, the Blanquists struck, attempting to seize a military arsenal and spark a general uprising; Granger was one of the organisers. The "coup" was premature, but not long after, Napoléon III, discredited by his conduct of the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), was overthrown. Granger, who had avoided arrest after the August uprising, participated in the last demonstration against Napoléon III on September 1 and in the invasion of the Legislative Assembly on September 4, 1870.
The Paris Commune.
In 1870-71, Granger was a co-editor and contributor of the Blanquist journal "La Patrie en Danger". He also commanded the 159th battalion of the National Guard and attempted to rally the French to resist the German army at all costs. On October 31, Granger and his battalion participated in an armed occupation of the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Along with other National Guard commanders who had participated in the insurrection, Granger was relieved of command, but his soldiers re-elected him, and although he was not recognised by the Versailles government, he resumed command of the 159th battalion. Granger participated in the Paris Commune as one of the representatives of the Blanquist faction. He was given the task of finding and liberating Blanqui (whose location was kept secret by the government), but before he could complete the mission, the Paris Commune was suppressed.
Exile and Return: Blanquist Politics Between Socialism and Nationalism.
Granger escaped England, remaining in exile in London until an amnesty enabled him to return to France. In the late 1870s and 1880s he was one of the principal editors of the Blanquist journal "Ni Dieu ni Maître" ("Neither God nor Master"). (He also contributed to "L'Homme Libre" and, after the death of Émile Eudes in 1888, replaced him as editor-in-chief of "Le Cri du Peuple".) The Blanquists launched a campaign for the release of their aged and infirm leader, and in 1879, they managed to have Blanqui elected to the National Assembly as deputy for Bordeaux. Because Blanqui was still in prison, the election was annulled, but in 1880 he was released. After his release, Blanqui came to live with Granger and died at his home in 1881.
Shortly after Blanqui's death, Granger, together with Édouard Vaillant and others, founded the Central Revolutionary Committee, the nucleus of the Blanquist party. However, the Blanquist ideology at this time was an unstable combination of radical Jacobin republicanism, egalitarian socialism, anti-clericalism, ardent national chauvinism and a strong current of xenophobia and antisemitism. While this was not an uncommon mixture in French radical politics in the late nineteenth century, the course of events made it increasingly evident that elements of this ideological mixture were in conflict with each other. One faction of the Blanquist movement accented the socialist heritage of Blanqui and moved closer to Jules Guesde's Marxist party, rejecting antisemitism and, at least in theory, endorsing the internationalist principles of socialism. This was the course of Édouard Vaillant. Another faction moved increasingly in the direction of virulent nationalism and antisemitism. This was the course Granger took. Although his was the smaller faction, Granger, who had been personally close to Blanqui, considered himself the true standard bearer of Blanquism, and Vaillant a late interloper.
Boulangism and the Split in Blanquism.
The conflict between Vaillantists and Grangerites brewed for some time in the Central Revolutionary Committee. It was intensified by the rise of General Georges Boulanger, who, in 1886, embarked on an increasingly powerful campaign for a revision of the constitution. Republicans generally and Blanquists in particular were divided over Boulanger. Many saw him as a latter-day Louis Bonaparte, whose populist rhetoric barely concealed his caesarian ambitions. They feared that Boulanger was preparing a "coup d'état" and intended to replace the Republic with his personal dictatorship, and they were alarmed by his financial and political ties to Orléanist monarchists. Other republicans believed the General's protestations of fidelity to the Republic and were attracted by his rhetoric of social reform, his revanchist desire to avenge the defeat of 1871 and retrieve Alsace-Lorraine, his reforms of the army and his anti-clerical gestures. While Vaillant was hostile to Boulanger, Granger was more and more openly sympathetic to the General's campaign.
For a while, the Blanquists papered over their differences by adopting a policy of official neutrality: the quarrel between Boulangists and bourgeois republicans was a quarrel within the bourgeoisie, in which the proletariat need not take sides. But as Boulanger's campaign gathered momentum, this position became increasingly untenable. The issue came to a head in 1888, when the Blanquists split over the candidacy of Henri Rochefort. Rochefort was a veteran republican with socialist sympathies and personal ties to many Blanquists and ex-Communards, but in the 1880s he had become a supporter of Boulanger and was running as a Boulangist candidate. Granger supported him; Vaillant supported his republican opponent Susini. The breach became irreparable; Granger and his supporters left the Central Revolutionary Committee and formed the Socialist-Revolutionary Central Committee, while Vaillant's followers renamed themselves the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Vaillant's party moved further into the socialist mainstream, merging with the Guesdists in 1901 and with the other major socialist factions in 1905 to form the unified socialist French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) political party. Granger and his group moved further into the slipstream of nationalism and eventually became defunct.
Nationalism and antisemitism.
In the late 1880s, Granger contributed to the journal "L'Intransigeant". In 1889 Granger's committee entered into an electoral alliance with the Boulangists. They divided the electoral districts between them, and Granger was elected to the National Assembly for the 19th arrondissement of Paris (Seine). He served one term; in 1893 he did not stand for re-election. In the late 1890s, the Dreyfus affair further divided Granger from the mainstream of French republican socialism. The majority of French socialists followed Jean Jaurès in supporting Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish officer falsely accused of spying for Germany, or at least maintained a policy of neutrality between the "bourgeois" Dreyfusards and anti-Dreyfusards (as Vaillant and Guesde did). However, some veteran republicans sided with those who condemned Dreyfus as a traitor. Granger was one of these. The anti-Dreyfusard campaign became increasingly openly antisemitic. Granger proclaimed himself, 'like Blanqui and Tridon, ... philosophically an antisemite' and professed his sympathy for Édouard Drumont, himself a former socialist who had migrated to the extreme nationalist right of the spectrum and was the chief apostle of antisemitism in France. Mainstream socialists saw in the anti-Dreyfus campaign an assault on the Republic and noted the anti-Dreyfusards' ties to royalist politicians; the Dreyfus Affair helped cement the socialists' official opposition to antisemitism and racism. By contrast, the Dreyfus Affair propelled Granger and a handful of others like him fully out of the mainstream of French socialism and republicanism and into currents which paved the way for French fascism in the twentieth century.
Granger did not live to witness the event which led to an eruption of nationalism in France and across Europe, torpedoing the official internationalism and anti-militarism of the Second International and dividing the mainstream socialist movement: the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.

1920 Golders Green Handley Page O/400 crash

The 1920 Handley Page O/400 crash occurred on 14 December 1920 when a Handley Page Transport Handley Page O/400 on a scheduled passenger flight from London to Paris with two crew and six passengers crashed at Golders Green in North London after take-off from Cricklewood Aerodrome. The crew of 2 and two passengers were killed in the first fatal accident for the airline since the service had started in December 1919. It was reported as the first recorded airliner crash in history, but a larger airliner had crashed the previous year.
Aircraft.
The aircraft involved was a Handley Page O/400 registered "G-EAMA", a large seven-passenger twin-engined biplane airliner. It had been built by the Birmingham Carriage Company and delivered to the Royal Air Force as a bomber during the first world war. As war surplus, it was converted into a passenger configuration in 1919 by Handley Page and used by Handley Page Transport for passenger services.
Accident.
The aircraft departed from Cricklewood Aerodrome around mid-day with six passengers, mail and freight for Paris. The weather was misty and the aircraft was seen flying low and then crashed into a tree, falling into a back garden of a house in Golders Green (No. 6 Basing Hill) close to the airfield. Four passengers jumped or were thrown clear before the aircraft burst into flames. The two crew and two remaining passengers were killed in the fire; of the survivors two were unhurt and the other two only slightly injured. Locals rushed to help but due to the intense heat, the rescue efforts were futile. The Hendon Fire Brigade extinguished the fire and removed the bodies; the aircraft was destroyed and the newly built house was badly damaged.
Inquest.
An inquest to the four deaths was held at Hendon on 16 December 1920. One of the survivors explained the events to the inquest, although he saw the engines being tested before the flight he did not hear any problems with them but the aircraft was not able to climb above 100 feet and suddenly struck a tree. After the aircraft had crashed he immediately climbed over the debris and escaped through a window. Other evidence came from another passenger, the dispatcher and one of the first to arrive on the scene, a ground engineer and the pilot who had flown the aircraft the previous day; all were questioned but the cause of the aircraft hitting a tree under 50 feet high was not determined. The coroner recorded a verdict that "the deceased died from consequence of burns due to the crashing of the aeroplane to the ground after striking a tree"; the coroner also said he did not have enough evidence to determine a cause.

Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage &amp; Motor Co Ltd

Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1914/1.html UKHL 1 is an English contract law case, concerning the extent to which damages may be sought for failure to perform of a contract when a sum is fixed in a contract. It held that only if a sum is of an unconscionable amount will it be considered penal and unenforceable.
It should not be confused with "Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd", which held that the same resale price maintenance practice was unenforceable against a third party reseller as a matter of the English rule of privity of contract.
Facts.
Dunlop sued its tyre retailer, New Garage, for breaching an agreement to not resell Dunlop tyres at a price lower than that listed in the contract. The agreement then said if that did happen, New Garage would pay £5 per tyre ‘by way of liquidated damages and not as a penalty’. 
The judge held the £5 sum was liquidated damages and enforceable. The Court of Appeal held the clause was a penalty and Dunlop could only get nominal damages. Dunlop appealed.
Judgment.
The House of Lords held the clause was not a penalty, and merely a genuine preestimate of Dunlop’s potential loss, and so Dunlop could enforce the agreement. Lord Dunedin set out the following principles.

Richard de Ferings

Richard de Ferings (died 1306), was the archbishop of Dublin.
Ferings was official of Canterbury, in which capacity he won the friendship of Archbishop Peckham. In 1279 he was present at the Council of Reading. In 1280 he was also for a short time official of Winchester, having been appointed by Peckham during a vacancy of the bishopric; but before long Peckham found him so indispensable that he brought him back to Canterbury, and put Adam of Hales into the post at Winchester. Next year Peckham made him Archdeacon of Canterbury, and in 1284 gave him the rectory of Tunstall, near Sittingbourne, to be held in commendam with the archdeaconry.
Ferings remained archdeacon until 1299, when he was appointed by Pope Boniface VIII to the archbishopric of Dublin. The feuds of the two rival chapters had long made the elections to that see constant subjects of disputes. In 1297 William of Hothum, himself a nominee of the pope after a contested election, died soon after his consecration. Early in 1298 Christ Church elected Adam of Belsham, and St. Patrick's chose their dean, Thomas of Chadsworth, for whom the canons had previously tried to secure the archbishopric. In their hurry neither body had secured the royal license to elect. Both were accordingly summoned to answer for the contempt, and the temporalities of Christ Church were for a time seized by King Edward. Ferings's appointment by the pope was consequently not opposed by the king. His consecration was probably abroad, as it is not noticed in the English authorities, though the date is given as 1299 in the ‘Annals of Ireland’ published with the ‘Chartulary of St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin’.
It was not, however, until June 1300 that Ferings received from the crown the temporalities of his see, after a renunciation of all the words in the bull of appointment which were prejudicial to the royal authority.
Ferings spent little of his time in Ireland. His conciliatory temper led him to several attempts to make peace with disappointed candidates and angry chapters. Even before his consecration he had appointed his old rival, Thomas of Chadsworth, his vicar, though he subsequently feared lest the infirmities of age made him unfit for the post, and urged the canons of St. Patrick's and Chadsworth himself to recommend a fit substitute if he were incapable. In 1300 he succeeded in persuading the canons of St. Patrick's and the monks of Christ Church to agree to a ‘final and full concord,’ which, while recognising that both churches were of metropolitical and cathedral rank, gave Christ Church, as the elder foundation, a certain honorary precedence. (The composition is printed in Mason's ‘St. Patrick's,’ App. vi.) It was perhaps to conciliate the wounded pride of St. Patrick's that he continued to make Chadsworth his vicar-general during his frequent absences abroad. In 1303 he also endowed St. Patrick's with the new prebends of Stagonil and Tipperkevin, the latter of which supported two prebendaries, and in 1304 he exempted the prebendal churches from the visitations of dean and archdeacon (Mason, St. Patrick's, App. iii. sec. vi.). In the same year he also confirmed the arrangements of his predecessors in reference to St. Patrick's (Hist. MSS. Comm. 10th Rep. pt. v. p. 217).
In 1302 he resigned to Edmund Butler the manor of Hollywood, near Dublin, which had for some time been in the possession of the see. In 1303 Ferings was summoned to the English parliament in his capacity of archbishop of Dublin. There are other precedents for this somewhat unusual course. His absence from Ireland was so far recognised by the king that he gave Ferings special permission to have the revenues of his see sent to England for his support, and in letters of protection granted to him Edward speaks of his being in England ‘by the king's order’. During his archbishopric the great valuation of the Irish churches was gradually taken. He died on 17 October 1306.

Facts.
Mlle Johanna Wagner was engaged by Benjamin Lumley to sing exclusively at Her Majesty’s Theatre on Haymarket from 1 April 1852 for 3 months, two nights a week. Frederick Gye, who ran Covent Garden Theatre, offered her more money to break her contract with Mr Lumley and sing for him.
Sir James Parker granted an injunction to restrain Mlle Wagner. She appealed.

Lord St Leonards LC, in the Lord Chancellor’s Court, held the injunction did not constitute indirect specific performance of Wagner’s obligation to sing. So an order could be granted that prohibited Mlle Wagner from performing further other than at Her Majesty's Theatre.

How Can I Love You More?

"How Can I Love You More" is the debut single from British band M People taken from their debut album "Northern Soul". It was written by Mike Pickering and Paul Heard, and produced by M People. The single was first released in 1991 peaking at number 29 and then re-released on 25 January 1993 with several new remixes. The song was a bigger hit and peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart.
Background.
When M People formed at the end of 1990, they had released "Colour My Life" as a limited edition White label to acclaim from both critics and colleagues as well as being heavily rotated on dancefloors. This single became the first official cut from the album ahead of its release in 1991. The band's core members, Mike Pickering and Paul Heard, had been working on the parent album and various tracks which featured a variety of different lead singers, including Mark Bell (who would go on to duet with Heather Small on hit single "Don't Look Any Further" on the next album). The band had also been trialling their songs out on the road playing at various small venues across the UK, particularly Northern England and "How Can I Love You More?" was turning out to be a favourite track when performed live as a classic "Northern Soul" number with a clear groove and Heather's gutsy vocals.
The song continued to be a real hit with fans that record label Deconstruction decided it should have another chance to be released. So after four introductory previous Top 40 singles from "Northern Soul"—"Colour My Life", "How Can I Love You More?", "Someday" and "Excited"—Manchester DJ Sasha produced and remixed new instrumental over Heather's original vocals from the 1991 original classic, keeping the original piano break. This turned the "Northern Soul" classic into an even bigger dance release.
"How Can I Love You More?" not only marked the start of M People's breakthrough, but was the first of four consecutive Top 10 singles in 1993. Only Take That sold more singles in their native UK. The success of the single is prompted by the fact that at the time it did not feature on any album and so was very much a unique M People track.
Composition.
The songs starts with an insistent piano riff that remains the backbone of the songs structure outside of the choruses, second keyboard plays strings throughout and subtle tambourine synths are layered over the top of the mid-tempo Soul groove. In the middle eight the insistent piano riff changes to a funky 60-second piano break on top of the underlying instrumental. Lyrically, the song is about the insecurites of being in-love if not reciprocated or if lost. And the constant repetition of the title in the chorus refrain highlights the desperate mood of the song and the want of trying to get 'good love' if not being received.
For the re-release, in Autumn 1992, Mike Pickering and Paul Heard approached Sasha with the idea to funk up two singles from "Northern Soul" ahead of its re-release: "Someday" and "How Can I Love You More?" into a massive alternative dance tunes, and he did. The biggest track and the album's lead single, "How Can I Love You More?" was chosen to be re-released the following spring, while the band worked on tracks for their new album. Heather’s vocals were slightly speeded up and some new vocal ad-libs were added and the melody speed increased from 125 to 140 bpm. The song stays true to the original piano arrangements, but layers of synths were added, new percussion, a second keyboard playing europhoric chords to replace the original string arrangement and a faster drum beat with a 4-tap reverb were added.
Chart performance.
When the single was initially released the first time it entered the chart at lowly number 61 at the end of October 1991, consequently spending the next five weeks climbing gradually to a peak of 29 following increasingly improved airplay, club acclaim especially in Northern England and their debut performance on Top of the Pops in the UK. The single left the chart at the end of the year after a total of nine weeks.
When re-released, thanks to large airplay and great DJ support the single entered the chart at number 9, awarding the band their first ever UK Top 10 Sales chart entry. They appeared on Top of the Pops again to promote the new version of the single the week of release in mid-February 1993. It was clear that the single was already proving very popular in the clubs and getting heavy rotation from both mainstream and dance stations. In the day’s of the early 1990s, two weeks of airplay was more than enough prior to release of a single, and "How Can I Love You More (Mixes)" proved this by then climbing further within the Top 10 to clim and peak to number 8 in its second week, with ever increasing airplay. It seemed the cult following of the original "Northern Soul" version as well as a new legion of fans were very much embracing the new adaptation. Respected DJ Sasha had transformed the single and gave it major credibility to give a soul classic a club-friendly edge for dance floors, who in-turn, very heavily rotated the song. It spent 8 weeks on the chart, leaving at the end of March 1993.
Video.
The video shows M People's core members: Mike Pickering on backing vocals and sax, Paul Heard on grand piano, and Heather Small on lead vocals performing in a disused but brightly lit Surrey Warehouse with their percussionist and drummer intercut with scenes of performing dancers. There are various close ups of each member of the band as they either sing into their mics or play their instruments in a faux live setting.
For the remix, there were no plans or budget to produce a brand new video, so a re-edited version of the video for 1991's version of "How Can I Love You More?" was used to promote the track, notably using additional inserts from the "Colour My Life" video in parts.
Live.
This Sasha remix has been performed during the Encore of the live gigs since 1994 alonsgide "Itchycoo Park", then laterly "Search for the Hero" and "Moving on Up". The original version of the song was once again played live from the Millennium Tour in the Winter of 1999, where the dance beat has made way for a more soulful groove once again, with hints of the original piano arrangement from the original version. Heather opens the song on her own singing the first verse of the song in a cappella as the song builds all around and the song crescendos at the end of the first verse.
During the piano break in the middle eight Heather normally enthuses the crowd with cheers and whoops to lead into the final chorus refrain where she sings "How Can I Love You More?" and the audience responds to her in the same vain, in a call-and-response style through to the end of the song.
Artwork.
The 1991 sleeve of the CD artwork is a simple dark blue cover with two very distinct vertical lines running through it. One colour is lime green running through the middle and the other is white to the left of the green line. There is also two wider lighter blue lines either side of the white line. The band's name is seen in medium-sized letters, in its typical font, on the top right of the artwork. On the 7" and 12" versions (seen above) the same cover is used but the lime green vertical line is wider with a white line running through it and another vertical white dissects the sleeve slightly off centre on the dark blue cover.
The 1993 art work of the mixes single incorporates the images of the previous single's artwork; the blue/green/white vertical lines from the original "How Can I Love You More?", the colourful circles on "Colour My Life", the square red blocks from "Excited" and the plain red flower on "Someday". It does this by using square photos of each of the band set up in the shape of a flower pattern with vertical colour lines in each picture. Some of these pictures can also be seen in the sleeve of the re-released "Northern Soul".

Francis Leke, 1st Earl of Scarsdale

Francis Leke, 1st Earl of Scarsdale (1581–1655) fought for the Royalist cause in the English Civil War.
Biography.
Francis Leke, of Sutton was the son and heir of Sir Francis Leke ("d". 1626) by his first wife, Frances, daughter and co-heir of Robert Swifte of Bayton, and Ellen his wife, daughter and heir of Nicholas Wickersley, County York. He was created a baronet in 1611, and Lord Deincourt (or d'Eyncourt) of Sutton in 1624.
At the beginning of April 1643 Lord Deincourt began to fortify his house at Sutton. Sir John Gell sent his brother, Colonel Thomas Gell, with 500 men and three pieces of ordnance, to besiege it. Lord Deincourt was summoned, but refused to surrender, and for some time obstinately defended himself. The house was taken, and Lord Deincourt and his men made prisoners: the works were demolished, and Lord Deincourt set at liberty, on giving his word that he would go to Derby within eight days, and submit himself to the Parliament. Sir John Gell observes, that the forfeiture of his word, on this occasion, was revenged by the garrison at Bolsover, who some time afterwards, when that castle was in the hands of the Parliament, plundered Lord Deincourt's house at Sutton. In the same year, fighting under Lord Deincourt's banner, two of his sons were killed fighting for their King, at the battle of Lansdowne, on 5 July 5, 1643.
In 1645, Lord Deincourt was created Earl of Scarsdale. Having rendered himself very obnoxious to the Parliament, by his exertions in the royal cause, during the First English Civil War, his estates were sequestered; and as he refused to compound, they were sold. His son procured some friends to be the purchasers, he paying the sum of £18,000, fixed by the Parliamentary commissioners as the composition.
Earl of Scarsdale having devoted himself, his family, and fortune, to the cause of King Charles I and monarchy, became so much mortified at the execution of King Charles, that he dressed himself in sackcloth, and having his grave dug some years before his death, laid himself down in it every Friday, exercising himself frequently in divine meditations and prayers. He died at his house at Sutton, in Scarsdale, 9 April 1655, and was buried in the church there.
The title became extinct by the death of Nicholas, the 4th Earl, in 1736. After this event, the large estates belonging to this family were sold for the payment of debts.
Family.
Francis Leke (Leake) married Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Cary (Carey) of Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire, and sister of Henry, Viscount Falkland, lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and they had the following children:
Leke's half brother William Leke was the father of Sir Francis Leke, 1st Bart

Desire Caught by the Tail

Desire Caught by the Tail is a farcical play written by the painter Pablo Picasso.
History.
In the winter of 1941, soon after the Germans had occupied Paris, Picasso while ill spent three days writing a play. Written in French, the piece was entitled "Le Désir attrapé par la queue," which translates literally to "Desire Caught by the Tail." However, it was not until 1944 that it had its first audience when it was given a reading in the Paris apartment of Michel Leiris. There the parts were read by such local literati as Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Valentine Hugo, Raymond Queneau and Picasso himself. Albert Camus directed the piece.
The Living Theatre made the play a part of their first critical success, when three poetic plays were staged at the same time. It was called "An Evening of Bohemian Theatre" at Cherry Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village, March 2, 1952, and also included plays by Gertrude Stein and T.S. Eliot. In June, 1959, Lorees Yerby Dutton directed a version of the play at the Coffee House Positano in Malibu, California. It premiered as a full staged production in 1967, in St. Tropez, France. The show, which was rumored (falsely) to have actors urinating on stage, was protested despite the town’s generally tolerant reputation. The central prop was a large black box, which served as a bathtub, a coffin and a bed. "Desire Caught by the Tail" was restaged in 1984 (with David Hockney acting) by the Guggenheim Museum. It has been rarely produced since.
Description.
Described as "surrealistic" and "simply weird," the play is rarely produced due to sheer incomprehensibility. There is no plot to speak of. The play has abstractly named characters: besides the protagonist Big Foot and his love interest Tart, there are Onion, Round End, the Cousin, the two Bow-wows, Silence, Fat Anguish, Skinny Anguish and The Curtains. And the stage directions are highly impractical: "the transparent doors light up and the dancing shadows of five monkeys eating carrots appear. Complete darkness."
While the narrative is nonlinear and the meaning nearly impossible to decipher, the work has been praised despite (and sometimes for) its lack of message. Bernard Frechtman, who translated the work from the original French, writes in his Foreword, "It says nothing of human destiny or of the human condition. In an age which has discovered man with a capital M, it is gratifying to advise the reader that Picasso has nothing to say of man, nor of the universe. This in itself is a considerable achievement."

Central de Abasto

The Central de Abasto (Supply Center) is Mexico City’s main wholesale market for produce and other foodstuffs run similarly to traditional public markets. It was constructed to be the meeting point for producers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers for the entire country. Located in the eastern borough of Iztapalapa, it is the most important commercial establishment in Mexico and the largest of its kind in the world. The market handles over 30,000 tons of merchandise daily, representing 80% of the consumption of the Mexico City metropolitan area. The market was established on former farmland to ease congestion in the historic center of Mexico City, but since then, the city has grown around it, bringing problems with traffic and crime, with robbery and kidnappings being the most serious.
Description and function.
The Central de Abasto is one of the two large wholesale markets in Mexico City, along with the Nueva Viga market, which specializes in fish and seafood. The facility is located on a property that extends , with more than 2,000 business that sell principally fruit, vegetables, meat and some processed foods in a main building that covers . The project was designed by architect Abraham Zabludovsky. He designed a slightly deformed hexagon shaped building which measures 2,250 meters across. The entrances and exits are located on opposite ends of the building. In addition, there are more than sixty other installations on the property with services such as refrigeration, shipping and more. The center commercializes more than 30,000 tons of food products daily, representing 80% of the consumption of the 20 million people in the Mexico City metropolitan area. This and the Nueva Viga market are the two largest employers in Iztapalapa The market generates 70,000 jobs directly and attends to more than 300,000 people per day. Its distribution network connects with more than 1,500 points of sale, including mercados públicos, tianguis, 380 establishments associated with fifteen chain stores as well as other kinds of commercial centers. The Central de Abasto is the most important food warehouse and distribution center in Mexico and the largest institution of its kind in the world, Although most of the business conducted at the site is between wholesalers and retailers, retail sales still play a significant role.
As an officially sanctioned wholesale market, the main purpose is to be a central meeting point between large scale buyers and sellers. It is designed to be the axis of food distribution not only in Mexico City but for the entire country as well. Its volume means that the business done here is important to the setting of prices for goods and distribution patterns. It also helps with the regulation of the country’s food supply to ensure adequacy and safety as it centrality eases the inspection process. This is especially true for food items such as produce, milk and meat.
The market was established and is run by the Fideicomiso Central de Abasto de la Ciudad de México, which is a trust set up in 1981 for a duration of 99 years under the Ley General de Títulos y Operaciones de Crédito. Members of the trust include the Government of Mexico City and the Secretary of Economic Development. The trust is headed by an Administrador General designated by a committee and approved by the head of the government of Mexico City. In 2002, daily operations of the market were turned over to the private sector, but with oversight by the trust. In addition to running the market, another function of the trust is to provide financing to suppliers, especially agricultural producers with little technology or credit with financing to allow them access to the principal markets of Mexico, as well as international markets.
History.
From the pre Hispanic period, there have been various open air markets called “tianguis” handled most of the foodstuffs sold in Mexico City. From these developed a number of larger fixed markets called mercados públicos. One of the earliest mercados públicos to be established in the city was the El Volador, located where the Supreme Court is now. The purpose of large, fixed markets then as now was to ease regulation. La Merced was another early market, established on what was the lakeshore near docks were farmers brought in their produce to sell in the city in boats. La Merced reached its height at the beginning of the 20th century, eventually becoming known as the “stomach of the city,” taking over most wholesale sales. However, neither La Merced nor the various others famous in the city such as Mercado de Sonora and La Lagunilla, never displaced local markets or tianguis.
Because of the growth and congestion of what is now the historic center of Mexico City, La Merced’s capacity was exceeded and the area around it no longer permitted the free flow of traffic in the city center. This situation existed for many years, but came to a crisis in the 1970s, forcing authorities to seek an alternative. At that time, much of the borough of Iztapalapa was undeveloped and contained farmlands, although it had been growing. City and federal officials decided to move wholesale food sales to a new facility to be built on “chinampa” farmland, with the goal of providing better entrance and egress, more space for vendors and be better for the environment. La Merced was not shut down, but rather became focused on retail sales, still mostly in food products, but not exclusively.
The relatively open land in Izatapalapa meant not only a larger facility but the construction of wider and better roads for shipping. However, the land that was appropriated for the project in the 1970s, was the last of the pre Hispanic chinampas in Iztapalapa, artificial islands originally near lake shore created for agriculture. The establishment of the Cental de Abastos would effectively eliminate this tradition in this part of the city.
Construction of the new facility was begun in 1981, designed by Abraham Zabludovsky . The project allowed for large scale excavations to be held in the area, important as it was part of the Culhuacan dominion and important up until Aztec times as the site of the Cerro de la Estrella and the New Fire ceremony. There was not time to excavate everything before construction, so archeologist covered unexcavated structures with protective material called “geotextile” to preserve them for future excavations. Construction was finished in 1982 and the facility was inaugurated in November of the same year, by President José López Portillo . It was considered to be the most important infrastructure project of the decade.
Since that time, the market has remained very important, but its establishment has created a number of problems. Since the 1970s, the borough of Iztapalapa has grown tremendously around the market, and now it is over 90% urbanized. This has returned the traffic related problems that plagued the La Merced market. This is particularly true on the north side which opens onto Eje 3 Oriente, which is the main access to the facility. Another problem is the amount of refuse that the facility generates. Neighbors next to the federally owned property have complained of large mounds of trash accumulating on the periphery. In some areas, such as on the Eje 6 roadway, the garbage spills over into the public venue, along with rocks and chemicals.
However, the most serious problem to have plagued the market and the area around it is crime. The borough of Iztapalpa has become one of the most crime ridden in Mexico City, but the market is a particular attraction for certain types of crime. Because of the large number of truckers and others that regularly enter and leave the area, the facility has become a magnet for prostitution. This includes the prostitution of minors. There are also significant problems with underage workers, and small scale drug trafficking.
However, the most serious threat is robbery and kidnapping. Robbery of merchandise, shipments and money, including violent episodes, is a constant concern, and many merchants have private security. NGO’s related to the kidnapping problem in Mexico such as Consejo para la Ley y los Derechos Humanos state that merchants from the facility are targeted by gangs associated with this crime. The targets include the merchants themselves, but more often it is family members. One recent case was the kidnapping and murder of Antonio Equihua Peralta, the minor son of one of a Abasto merchant. In the last ten years, there have been 286 proven cases of people associated with the market who have been held against their will. Police have conducted raids and other operations to improve security over the years. Market official and police have claimed that crime statistics as of 2007 have significantly improved, up to 90% from highs over the tenure of current administrator Raymundo Collins Flores. However, market merchants have demanded more security including the installation of 4,000 surveillance cameras and the establishment of 4,000 member police squad specifically to the market.
Over twenty five years after the federal government expropriated fifty chinampa properties to build the facility, former owners are still demanding return for the loss of their cropland. At the time, the farmers received forty pesos per square meter. However, many claim that since much of the land was never built on, it should be sold back to the original owners for the equivalent price. Most of the claimants are over fifty who lost their only means of subsistence with the loss of their lands.

Reforms for the Future

Reforms for the Future () was a Ukrainian deputy group turned faction in its national parliament Verkhovna Rada created on February 16, 2011. Deputy Ihor Rybakov (earlier elected on the election list of the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko), is the groups faction leader. The faction supports the Azarov Government. All members of the group had individually already entered into the parliamentary coalition which supported this government. At its peak the group contained 21 deputies (in January 2012). In the current parliament elected on 28 October 2012 that has started its tasks on 15 December 2012 the faction was not re-created.
History.
Reforms for the Future started as a new deputy group in the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) on August 31, 2010. The Reforms for the Future deputy group stated in September 2010 that it intended to seek the rights of a parliamentary faction. After the cancellation of the "Imperative Mandate" on October 1, 2010 it became possible for 15 or more deputies to form a parliamentary faction (a lawmaker can join only one faction; the chairman and his two assistants cannot head factions of deputies). At that time, the deputy group consisted of 17 deputies expelled from the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc–Batkivschyna faction (BYuT) and two deputies from the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc faction. MP Ivan Pliusch (at the time an independent MP) joined the group on February 15, 2011. Taras Chornovil joined Reforms for the Future soon after. Setting up a faction without a party is not uncommon in Ukraine's parliamentary history. Several influential parties have been founded after they had already founded a faction in the Verkhovna Rada, examples of this are the Party of Regions, All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland" and Labour Ukraine.
Rumours that the group was formed by businessmen who allegedly "fled" from BYuT "for fear of political persecution" have been denied by the group. Early 2012 Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko deputy Roman Zabzalyuk was briefly a member of the group; he claimed to investigate political corruption. He stated after rejoining the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko early February 2012 that "They offer $500,000 for a transfer the parliamentary group, and then they pay a monthly salary of $20,000-25,000"; according to the deputy leader of the Reforms for Future group, Volodymyr Kapliyenko, Zabzalyuk had claimed he was "suffering a very serious disease" and the group had raised some $100,000 for Zabzalyuk to undergo surgery in Israel. The day after these allegations were made (9 February 2012) Chornovil left the faction. BYuT deputies claimed mid-February 2012 they had transferred the bribes Zabzalyuk had received to the Okhmatdyt National Children's Hospital.
In the current parliament elected on 28 October 2012 that has started its tasks on 15 December 2012 the faction was not re-created. But certain former member where re-elected in parliament.
Issue stances.
The group supported land reform, pension reform and raising of the retirement age. The group stated it basically supports all reforms initiated by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych "but with corrections".

The Spice Trail

The Spice Trail is a British television documentary series first broadcast on BBC Two in 2011 looking at the discovery and history of spices. Presented by Kate Humble, she travels around the world to see how spices are made and investigates their history. She also tells stories and interviews the people from the areas of their origin. The series looks at how local economies are built upon the income from the spices and the threats to these economies such as disease, globalisation and fakes.
Episodes.
Episode one: "Pepper and Cinnamon".
In the first half we visit India to look at Pepper and find out that Black pepper corns are traditionally sun dried. We are told that White pepper is soaked and de-husked to make it milder. Green pepper is mentioned but not explained and Red is not mentioned at all. We see how the corns are removed by being trodden on and massaged by bare feet. We see the devastation a Fungal disease has brought to what was once the primary area of production. We also see the silent and secret negotiation language of the buyers and sellers who use their hands under a cloth to negotiate without the need for a spoken language (a kind of Tactile signing).
In the second half we see small Cinnamon trees being cut in Sri Lanka. The outer Bark is scraped by hand and the inner bark is then carefully removed with a knife. The best parts are used to create an outer sheaf and the other parts are placed within. These outer sheaves are joined to each other and overlap slightly to create a standard length stick or rod known as a quill. The sticks are then rolled daily as they dry and are tied into bundles for trading and transport.
Episode two: "Nutmeg and Cloves".
In this programme we visit the Spice Islands in Indonesia, the original home of these two spices. In the first half we look at nutmeg and discover it has many layers. There is the outer fruit which is used for jam. When ripe the fruit opens revealing a red nut and this is the best time to pick it we are told. However in the program we see examples of fruit being cut open when it has been picked early. We see the outer red skin of the nut being removed and dried to create mace. The inner skin or black shell of the nut is then removed and discarded and what is left is the hard brown "nut" we call nutmeg. We also find out that Almond trees are important for shade and a species of Dove is responsible for planting most of the almonds trees and nutmeg trees.
The second half of the programme looks at Cloves. We are introduced to the pink flower buds on the tall trees and are told that the best cloves are pink and not yet opened. A mixture of long poles, rope pulling and tree climbing are used so the pickers can collect the clusters of buds from all over the trees. Back on the ground the individual cloves are snapped off from the bud cluster and they are sun dried in the streets. The rest of the bud cluster (stalks and a few small young leaves) are used as an additive to Tobacco, and we see Kate attempting, after much effort, to make a Herbal cigarette.
Episode three: "Vanilla and Saffron".
In the first half the programme looks at Saffron. We visit the Berbers of Morocco, the origin of saffron to see the purple Crocus flowers growing in what looks like a desert. The fields are irrigated with water channels dug into the ground and Sheep dung is carried by the water to fertilize at the same time. The harvest lasts no more than a month and the flowers are picked early every morning. Each bulb produces four flowers each season. During the day, the Stamens are removed and it is a social event like the picking which involves almost everyone in the village. The stamens are dried. We are told that red is the best and the deeper the red the better the saffron. Handling the flowers gives people purple fingers and the people in the area are generous with their saffron using it in drinks and a wide range of cuisine.
The programme then moves to Spain which was so suitable for saffron that it became the saffron capital of the world after being conquered by the Muslims. We are told that saffron from all over the world is now brought there and traded. With saffron being so expensive it is often diluted with other spices (such as turmeric), stamens from other plants or species and even plastic and other contaminants. We got to visit one of the laboratories which does DNA testing and Spectrum analysis as it seeks to maintain the high quality of saffron and to protect it from fraud and impurities which would devalue the genuine product.
In the second half of the program we discover that Vanilla is a Mexican spice. The Pollination is performed by the Melipona bee that is native to Mexico and we find that it was not possible to grow vanilla elsewhere in the world until a slave boy discovered how to self-pollinate the plants. Once artificial pollination was discovered the price collapsed and the vanilla trade in Mexico is now greatly reduced compared to what it used to be. We are told that vanilla is an orchid but also a vine. We get to see a vanilla flower being self-pollinated and are told they are only open for a few hours. It takes 9 months for the pods to develop and another 9 months for them to dry and cure. The best pods have crystals on them.
Reviews.
Most of the reviews found Humble to be enthusiastic and sincere and show was liked by many of the reviewers. However, others found the show to be repetitive and found Kate to be patronising.
"The Guardian" found the show "interesting" and repetitive and warned Kate not to read the review because they were "going to be mean and horrid" to her.
Then Kate goes to Sri Lanka and does the same with cinnamon. Oooh, can I have a go, let me try, oh I'm rubbish at it, and you're amazing, ha ha ha.
"The Independent" were "in love" with Kate and found her to be enthusiastic and compared her to a head girl.
One of the things that made The Spice Trail so watchable was the enthusiasm – the effusiveness – of all involved. No one looked like they'd been kowtowed into it by some executive. They all seemed to be genuinely engaged. And so it was that, not only did we meet the buyers and sellers of the spices in question, but we got to go into people's homes and hear about their families.
" The Mirror" was more balanced, calling her enthusiastic in her efforts to engage with the locals and sincere as she states the obvious.
And it’s lucky for Kate that our favourite flavourings originate in some of the most beautiful spots in the world.
"Metro" focused their review on the problems the growers face and consider Kate to be patronising and mention a Blue Peter style of reporting.
Though every so often, she took a nibble out of a hard-edged news story – the disease wrecking India’s pepper crops and driving farmers to suicide, the rip-off deals that turn spice workers into virtual slaves – she quickly skipped merrily on, playing the colonial grande dame out to charm the exotic locals.
" The Express" gave a factual account of the show and made it one of their "picks of the day"
KATE Humble travels along India’s fascinating Spice Coast to uncover the story of pepper, once known as black gold.

Christian Evangelical Church of Romania

The Christian Evangelical Church of Romania () is a Plymouth Brethren Protestant denomination, one of Romania's eighteen officially recognised religious denominations.
History.
Under the influence of foreign Plymouth Brethren missionaries active in Romania in the late 19th century, a group of "free Christians" was founded in Bucharest in 1899. Initially, members were foreign residents of the capital city; they were later joined by Romanian converts. Also known as "Darbyites" after John Nelson Darby, the British 19th century founder of their theological current, the group was considered unlawful in the 1920s and was accused of spreading communist ideas. In 1933, the Romanian state recognised them as a religious association, the "Christian  Evangelicals". In 1939, they were compelled by the National Renaissance Front regime to merge with the "Christians of the Scriptures" or Tudorites. The Christian Evangelical Church was thus formed, with two branches: branch I, which practised believer's baptism, and branch II, which employed infant baptism. (The difference stemmed from the tradition whence each emerged: Plymouth Brethren and Romanian Orthodox, respectively.)
Banned under the World War II-era regime of Ion Antonescu, in 1946, the Evangelical Christians were recognised as a religious body by the Romanian state, having once again merged with the Tudorites and a splinter group called "Christians" centred at Ploieşti. In 1950, soon after the advent of the Communist regime, the Christian Evangelicals had 600 churches; a large number of smaller ones were officially closed following a state ruling that they must have at least twenty members, but many of them probably continued to meet quietly. In the late 1970s, the group claimed to have nearly 400 churches, a number of which awaited official registration, and around 55,000 members. A number of scholars suggest a figure of 120,000, but this is likely based on Tudorite support within the Orthodox Church and also includes a considerable number who had not formally transferred their membership and thus were not listed as members. By the 1980s, there was a full-time secretary and a three-member executive committee in Bucharest, although there was a great deal of ambiguity regarding the committee's authority. The church, like its neo-Protestant counterparts, received no state aid, supporting itself entirely from member contributions. Members also had social concerns, supporting a ninety-member leprosy community. Doctrinally, the church was closest to the Baptists, with whom it shared a pension programme. It had relationships with Brethren churches in California, Canada, Czechoslovakia, England, Germany, Hungary and Switzerland. In a display of support for their colleagues, representatives from these foreign communities attended the peace conferences allegedly sponsored by the Romanian religious communities in the 1980s.
The church had occasional difficulties with the Communist state. Its entire leadership was dismissed in 1984 for failing to exercise the required supervision over its assemblies regarding unofficial religious services. Local and regional officials of the Department of Religious Affairs viewed as responsible for allowing these unofficial gatherings to take place were also fired. Church officials were indicted for failing to expel members who had been convicted of illegal Bible distribution. The Department of Religious Affairs intervened and appointed the church's new leadership. Following the 1989 Revolution and the fall of the regime, the two branches split, ostensibly over the issue of baptism, with the second becoming the Evangelical Church of Romania.
Beliefs and organisation.
Members see as their forerunners those who thought the church had lost its ability to preach the Gospel after Constantine the Great's Edict of Milan proclaimed religious toleration for Christians in 313 AD. They thus seek a restoration of early Christianity and recognise no hierarchy other than the "headship of Christ". Their focus is on the supreme importance of inner religious life; perceiving the world to be corrupt, they look forward to the premillennial era. The church stresses a strong focus on the Bible and spontaneous divine leading in its services rather than carefully orchestrated worship. Romanian Orthodox theologian Petru Deheleanu noted doctrinal similarities to the Tudorites and the Baptists.
According to the 2002 census, the church had 46,029 members, making up 0.2% of the population; it was the country's 11th largest recognised religious body. There is no hierarchy; instead, the church is completely reliant on a lay ministry. Bible readings and expositions, prayers and fervent singing are a feature of services. There is a spontaneity that leads to considerable member participation, and individual churches express a strong measure of autonomy. At the local level, each church or "gathering" has at least twenty adult members and is led by two to five "elders" or presbyters, who also function as preachers of the Gospel. As of 2008, there were 678 churches and 724 preachers. In 1994, a new structure, the zonal community, was introduced. There are sixteen of these, led by a brethren assembly that elects a leadership committee and is itself elected by the general conference. At the national level, the Union of Christian Evangelical Churches is led by a national brethren assembly that elects the permanent leadership, a president and two vice-presidents. The union's highest body is the quadrennial general conference, which elects the national brethren assembly and confirms the union's permanent leadership.
The church runs the university-level Timotheus Theological Institute in Bucharest and five Bible schools. Since 1949, it has edited "Calea Credinţei" ("The Path of Faith"), as well as the magazine "Ecouri creştine" ("Christian Echoes"), expressing its pietistic orientation to life. It has also published a number of theological works. Since 1990, it has run some forty associations and foundations. These involve most church members, and among their activities are teaching, orphanages, kindergartens and relief work. Also since that time, the church has re-established links with evangelical churches outside Romania, and joint projects have included evangelisation, exchanges of Biblical studies and charitable activities.

Evangelical Church of Romania

The Evangelical Church of Romania (), a Protestant denomination, is one of Romania's eighteen officially recognised religious denominations.
History.
The church originated between 1920 and 1924, the work of the young Romanian Orthodox theologians Dumitru Cornilescu (whose Bible translation is used by neo-Protestant churches in Romania) and Tudor Popescu (a former priest at the Cuibul cu barză Church). Also known as Tudorites, the deeply pietistic movement, regarded as the only neo-Protestant church with Romanian origins, originated in a profound religious experience of Popescu's. Following this, he began to preach repentance and faith, questioning the significance attached by Orthodoxy to the saints, icons and the sacraments, and emphasising the centrality of the Bible instead of the liturgy. Eventually excommunicated and barred from addressing Orthodox congregations, he was lent an auditorium by an affiliate of the Anglican Mission to the Jews in Bucharest. Much to the consternation of his former church, he was able to firmly establish his work, drawing large crowds with his very popular preaching.
Under the leadership of Popescu and Cornilescu, several hundred followers built a 1000-seat mother church in 1926, which still drew close to eight hundred worshipers on an average Sunday morning in the early 1990s. At the request of government authorities, some of whom Popescu deeply impressed, the new movement registered as an association in 1927 and, in order to be distinguished from other groups, took the name "Christians of the Scriptures". Shortly thereafter, churches opened in Ploieşti, Câmpulung, Târgovişte, Rucăr, Buzău, Piteşti, Bârlad, Braşov and other places.
In 1939, despite differences in dogma and worship, the National Renaissance Front regime compelled the "Christians of the Scriptures" to merge with the "Christian Evangelicals", resulting in the Christian Evangelical Church. The resultant church had two branches: branch I, which practised believer's baptism, and the Tudorite branch II, which employed infant baptism. (The difference stemmed from the tradition whence each emerged: Plymouth Brethren and Romanian Orthodox, respectively.) Outlawed under the World War II-era regime of Ion Antonescu, in 1946, the Evangelical Christians were recognised as a religious body by the Romanian state, with the Tudorites once again merged into the Plymouth Brethren church, and also including a splinter group called "Christians" centred at Ploieşti. (For an overview of the church's development under the Communist regime, see Christian Evangelical Church of Romania.) Following the 1989 Revolution and the fall of the regime, the two branches split at a general conference held in Bucharest a month later. They separated ostensibly over the issue of baptism, with the second emerging as the Evangelical Church of Romania.
Organisation.
According to the 2002 census, the church had 18,758 members, making up 0.1% of the population; it was the country's 14th largest recognised religious body. As of 2008, there were some 220 churches, mainly in Bucharest and in the counties of Ilfov, Argeş, Braşov, Constanţa, Dâmboviţa, Ialomiţa, Prahova and Vaslui. (culte2) The church considers all members to be brothers, has no clergy or hierarchy, is completely reliant on a lay ministry, and considers Christ as its head. At the national level, there is a brethren assembly of elected representatives, which supervises and coordinates church life, as well as a leadership committee that represents the church in its dealings with the state. Members are not required to make contributions for the upkeep of the church. The church's justification for baptism by immersion is that the early Christians had this practice, but it stresses the importance of personal belief in Christ and not just baptism. During services, members sing together fervently without benefit of a choir or instruments. Bible readings and expositions, as well as prayers, are also featured, and services' spontaneity leads to considerable member participation, with individual churches enjoying strong autonomy.
The church published a semimonthly newsletter, "Adevărul Creştin" ("The Christian Truth"), as well as other theological works. It has relations with the Union of the Free Evangelical Churches in Germany as well as with evangelical churches in the Netherlands and the United States, but has no direct outside equivalent.

White River Bridge

The White River Bridge was built in 1929 in Mount Rainier National Park as part of the Yakima Park Road project. The new road was planned to open up access to the northeastern portion of the park. The bridge, spanning the White River was built by contractor John D. Tobin of Portland, Oregon, who had previously built the Narada Falls Bridge and the Christine Falls Bridges, both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Plans for the bridge were drawn by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs in the National Park Service Rustic style, with construction supervision by NPS landscape architect Ernest A. Davidson. The three-centered arch spans , with a stone-faced concrete structure.
The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 13, 1991. It is part of the Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District, which encompasses the entire park and which recognizes the park's inventory of Park Service-designed rustic architecture.
