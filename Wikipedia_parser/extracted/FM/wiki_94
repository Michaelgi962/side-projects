Screen heating

The method of screening has been linked to the early Egyptians who used the process to separate basic minerals by using a mesh that had equal openings. This idea fell down through the ages and developed into a series of European patents around 1924, when the thought of electrically heating the wire cloth for screens was considered. This was the first attempt at eliminating screen blinding (when the material being processed (clay, dirt, etc.) clogs the holes in the screen) by using heat, and it proved that the surface tension from blinding was reduced when heat was introduced.
The first commercially available screen heating system was developed in 1947 by F.R. Hannon & Sons (now Hanco International (and Thomas W. Hannon obtained a patent for his electrically heated screen construction and method [http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02812062&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D2,812,062.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F2,812,062%2526RS%3DPN%2F2,812,062&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=04148724&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526co1%3DAND%2526d%3DPTXT%2526s1%3D%252522hannon%25253B%252BThomas%252BW%252522.INNM.%2526OS%3DIN%2F%2526RS%3D&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page][http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02825461&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D2,825,461.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F2,825,461%2526RS%3DPN%2F2,825,461&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page][http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=03195725&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D3,195,725.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F3,195,725%2526RS%3DPN%2F3,195,725&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page]. This was just in time, as industries were beginning to expand in coming out of World War II. The first applications of the screen heating system were limited almost exclusively to the clay industry, though it did not take long for other applications, in a variety of industries, to be identified.
Another significant invention for screen heating was created by Thomas W. Hannon (for Hanco International). This was for screen-related clamp bars (also known as a Wedge Grip), that are used when mounting a screen on frame members. The clamp bars secured a screen to a tensioning rail, which in turn increased the electrical connection between the two components. ([http://patft1.uspto.gov])
In the years following, copper and copper cables were implemented in an attempt to improve the system. Silicon-bonded fiberglass was also added to the insulation of screen boxes. For a short period, flexible shunts were also used, but a major deficiency was found in attaching the stationary transformer to a screen that vibrated.
The Invention of the Flux-Power Screen Heating System.
In exploring ways to properly attach a transformer to a vibrating screen, Hanco International (pioneered the Flux-Power Screen Heating System [http://www.hanco.com/HancoScreenHeating.html. The invention came to be in 1961, created by Thomas W. Hannon ([http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=03154757&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D3,154,757.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F3,154,757%2526RS%3DPN%2F3,154,757&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page]), and it was unlike anything of its time. The design eliminated the use of physical connections as seen in earlier screen heating systems. Omitting the mechanical connection also deletes the possibility of primary winding failures that come with short circuits on the secondary of the transformer while eliminating wear and fatigue on the screen, itself. This design also allowed for the transformer to be encapsulated and protected from the elements and dust.
When processing basic mineral deposits (clay, shale, limestone, etc.), Flux-Powered Screen Heating Systems are ideal. Heating the screen lessens surface tension from moisture which is a main reason for stickiness against cloth mediums. Introducing heat allows maximum contact and keeps the screen clear, allowing finer material separations and more precise sizing. This, in turn, adds to efficiency.
Flux-Powered Screen Heating Systems have been used and proven effective in screening fertilizers (in handling phosphoric, potash and sulfate rock), foods, chemicals, and in recovering coal for power.

Columbia Transit

Columbia Transit is a city-owned public bus system that serves the city of Columbia, Missouri. The system operates Monday through Saturday, except on major holidays. Services include fixed-route services, on-call para-transit shuttles for the disabled, a system of commuter shuttles for students and employees of the University of Missouri, and hotel shuttles (known as the "Spirit Shuttle") during MU football games. In fiscal year 2009, 2,007,263 rides were logged along the system's six fixed routes and University of Missouri Shuttle routes, while the latest available records show 27,000 rides logged aboard the para-transit service.
History.
The system was formerly operated by the Columbia Municipal Bus Lines Company from 1945 to 1965. On September 10, 1965, after the company went out of business, the city of Columbia took over the operation of the system. Originally it had ten orbital routes, in addition to the university routes for students and staff. In 1982, the Wabash Station in downtown Columbia (built in 1910 as a rail depot) became the system's central transfer point. Since then, the station has been expanded and renovated. Beginning in the early 1970s, the system has undergone many changes and serves citizens and students in a variety of ways. Ridership levels have varied throughout the system's history, and have increased during recent years. Current ridership is at record levels.
Fixed routes.
The six fixed routes operate Monday through Saturday: from 6:25 am to 6:25 pm Monday-Wednesday; from 6:25 am to 10:25 pm Thursday and Friday; and from 10:00 am to 7:30 pm Saturday. The routes are numbered 101-106, and are designated with a color. Buses operate on one route throughout the day; at the route end points, they will return inbound and repeat (except for final trips at the end of at-peak periods, and the last runs of the day). Buses operate with either an N/S or E/W after the number to indicate route direction. 
The fixed routes are:
Routes 101-104 and 106 have timed transfers at Wabash Station. Routes 101 and 105 have timed transfers at Bethel and Diego streets during at-peak times (between 6:25 am–9:45 am and 2:25 pm–6:25 pm Monday through Friday). Routes 101-104 operate on a 40-minute headway. At peak-service times two buses operate in both directions, allowing a frequency of every 40 minutes. During off-peak times (midday, evenings, Saturday) the frequency is every 80 minutes. Route 105 operates on a 40-minute headway from 6:40 am–9:40 am and from 2:45 pm–6:25 pm Monday through Friday; it does not operate during midday, evenings, or on Saturday. Buses on Route 106 complete the Downtown Orbit every 40 minutes. At-peak service frequency is every 20 minutes.
There is no fixed-route Sunday service.
University of Missouri shuttle.
Columbia Transit provides free shuttle service to University of Missouri students and employees. Buses serve off-campus apartment complexes throughout Columbia and a network of commuter parking lots adjacent to the campus. Most routes are free; however, routes serving off-campus housing complexes collect fares and also serve non-student residents living there. Funding for the shuttle system is collected by parking and residential fees charged to students needing the service. Nearly all routes serving students terminate at Brady Commons, the student union at the university. Operation times vary from route to route, and some offer late-night service. Routes for this system operate from the fall semester through the spring semester, and do not operate during the summer months. The University Shuttle System accounts for approximately half of Columbia Transit's annual ridership. The routes serving the University community vary from year to year, in order to meet the changing needs of on- and off-campus student housing.
Routes 205-209 are subsidized by housing complexes. In August 2006, the Reserve and Campus Lodge Apartments agreed to pay Columbia Transit an estimated $30,000 per year for bus service along Old 63 as the 207/208 Gold Route. As part of the agreement Columbia Transit could collect its standard fare along the route, but riders from the Reserve and Campus Lodge would be exempt from payment. The route began with service every hour until 6 pm. In August 2007, with its growing popularity, Columbia Transit began service every half-hour until 6 pm. In 2008, the University of Missouri agreed to help subsidize shuttle service after it added a housing option at Campus Lodge. Service began in August from 6 pm-1:30 am. The University housing option increased ridership along the route, and caused Columbia Transit to increase bus service again along the Gold Route. For the 2009 Fall Semester, both 207 and 208 ran every 10 minutes throughout the day. Route 209 is Columbia Transit's newest route. It began under similar terms as the Campus Lodge/Reserve agreement; however, it uses smaller converted paratransit buses.
Para-transit.
In 1990 Columbia Transit began providing curb-to-curb para-transit service to those eligible, in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. This service utilizes van-based buses, equipped with wheelchair lifts. Passengers can request transportation between any two points within the city limits. The fare is $2.00 per one-way trip. All rides must be booked one business day in advance; this can be done online at the city's website.

Fares for Columbia Transit fixed routes vary from $.75 to $1.50, with several discounted fares available. Transfers are issued (upon request) when fares are paid, and are good for one-way trips only. Passengers may transfer from route to route at several pre-arranged points where two (or more) bus routes intersect. Columbia Transit also offers a variety of "FASTPass" fare cards and electronic transfers. 
Fleet.
Columbia Transit operates a diverse fleet of 41 transit buses, eleven para-transit vans and several support vehicles. Most buses are 35- and 40-foot New Flyer low-floor buses. In addition, the system also uses several 40-foot Gillig Corporation Phantom buses, 30-foot ElDorado National buses, and two Gilling 40-foot Euro-style buses. Most of the fleet is planned to be replaced by 2015, pending budgetary approval. The city may purchase hybrid and/or methane-powered buses in the future. 
The City Council decided (in a unanimous vote on November 16, 2009) to approve a measure for transit advertising. The decision came after a five-year debate on the issue, with the threat of budget decreases pushing through the measure. The city received two bids after requesting them in August of that year, with the larger potential-income proposal coming from Midwest-based Transit Advertising (a firm specializing in transit advertisements). The company's bid guaranteed an income of at least $204,000 per year of which Columbia Transit would keep 60%, or $122,400 (whichever was greater). Advertisements vary from small banners inside buses to full bus wrap ads. 
All fixed-route buses are equipped with bike racks which can carry two standard bicycles. Use of the bike racks is provided at no additional charge.
Evolution.
In recent years, the Columbia Transit system has undergone several changes to service and infrastructure. During this time, ridership levels for the fixed-route system have grown from around 400,000 passengers in 2003 to over 2 million riders per year. In 2004 City Council approved motions for the renovation and expansion of Wabash Station in downtown Columbia; federal funding was approved for construction. In June 2004, many changes were made to the primary routes in an effort to reduce headway times (which had continued to grow because of traffic congestion). Changes were made to the 4-Red, 3-Green and 2-Blue routes; the 5-Yellow route was reduced (due to poor ridership) from a peak-service commuter route along Forum Boulevard to a one-morning/one-afternoon weekday run, with a transfer to the 1-Orange. While no trolley buses were purchased, due to strong popular support the 6-Brown Downtown Orbiter was introduced along with the 7-Purple Theater Special, a route running from Forum 8 Goodrich Theater to Hollywood Stadium 14 Theater with a transfer to the 6-Brown at University Hospital, roughly halfway between the two theaters. In June, 2006, the "FASTPass" electronic fare card program was introduced along with electronic transfer slips. Other changes during that month had the 6-Brown's extended at-peak service removed Thursday evenings, and the 7-Purple was rerouted to the Wabash Station to encourage ridership. In August of that year, the 8-Gold route was introduced to the university sysytem. The 8-Gold service area includes Campus View, the Reserve and several other student-housing complexes. At the time the route was partially funded by the owners of those complexes, although the university later contributed operating funds. This route has since grown into three different routes (now routes 207 and 208W/E), and are key components of the niversity's shuttle system. 
In June 2007, a $2.3 million renovation and expansion of the Wabash bus station on North Tenth Street began after nearly a decade of planning. The building has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979, so construction had to retain the building's historic quality. The project included exterior renovation of the original structure, remodeling of the interior and passenger lobby, construction of an administrative wing and a large canopy-covered bus port extending into the rear lot. As part of the "percent for art" program, one percent of the total construction cost was dedicated to artwork primarily by local artists. Two Boone County artists, painter David Spear and sculptor Don Asbee, created large oil paintings of the former and current station for the lobby and a metal train sculpture underneath the bus port. The project was completed by summer 2008. 
Between major projects and modifications, several amenities have been upgraded throughout the system. Bus shelters and benches have been added, and the fleet has periodically been updated. In November 2007, LED electronic destination signs were installed to replace the scroll-style signs prone to ripping during operation. In fall 2010, advertisements made their way aboard city buses. There are additional projects awaiting funding for infrastructure improvement and larger projects well into the planning stage. Many planned improvements and developments are aimed to expand service area and operation times and improving local transportation coordination, as well as adding new infrastructure and facilities. In August 2010 the fixed-route system was reconfigured, taking existing routes and rerouting them to extend the service area. Saturday routes (previously different from weekday routes) were aligned with weekday routes. The 105 Yellow route was restored to commuter-route status as the 105 Purple route; a transfer between 105 and 101 was added, and the 101 Orange Route South was rescheduled to travel against the congestion which had previously caused delays.

Fence Records

Fence Records is an independent record label based in Anstruther and Cellardyke, Fife, Scotland, founded by musician King Creosote and run by The Pictish Trail until August 2013. Fence Records has released records by James Yorkston, Rozi Plain, Lone Pigeon, U.N.P.O.C., Kid Canaveral, eagleowl, Randolph's Leap, Deaf Mutes, Withered Hand, Delifinger, The Shivers and FOUND amongst others. The Fence Collective is the name given to artists on or associated with the label.
History.
Fence was founded in 1997 by Kenny Anderson, who performs under the name King Creosote, who, after the record shop he was working in went bust, began to record and sell the music of his friends. The label side of Fence grew steadily in size, in terms of audience and artist roster, boasting a variety of musical styles beyond its initial folk slant and geographical focus. Fence organised a number of festivals including Homegame, Haarfest, Hott Loggz and Eye o' the Dug which took place in Ansturther, Cellardyke and St. Andrews, and Away Game which took place on the Isle of Eigg. Various festivals have also hosted Fence Nights/Showcases including Edinburgh Festival Fringe and Glasgow's West End Festival.
The label became a limited company during 2012, but Kenny Anderson increasingly distanced himself from the label early in the partnership, feeling that the label and collective had strayed into territory where he was less comfortable. The limited company ceased operations in August 2013, due to differences between Kenny Anderson and The Pictish Trail who had been handling most of the organisation of releases and events since 2003. The announcement that the limited company would cease operations was followed by a statement from Anderson, saying that he will continue to use the Fence Records name with new projects to be announced in January 2014.
The majority of the Fence label roster including Rozi Plain, Seamus Fogarty, Randolph's Leap, Monoganon, Kid Canaveral and eagleowl chose to leave to continue working with The Pictish Trail on his new project, Lost Map Records in August 2013.

Edward F. Caldwell &amp; Co.

Edward F. Caldwell & Co., of New York City, was one of the premier designers and manufacturers of electric light fixtures and decorative metalwork from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries. Founded in 1895 by Edward F. Caldwell (1851–1914) and Victor F. von Lossberg (1853–1942), the firm left a legacy of custom designed and finely-made, metal gates, lanterns, chandeliers, ceiling and wall fixtures, floor and table lamps, and other decorative objects that can be found today in many metropolitan area churches, public buildings, offices, clubs, and residences including, the White House (1902 renovation), St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, New York Public Library, and Rockefeller Center.
Edward F. Caldwell (1851-1914).
Edward F. Caldwell, a portrait painter originally from Waterville, New York, became part of an active community of designers in New York City during the early 1880s. By the end of that decade and into the 1890s, Caldwell worked for and later became chief designer and vice president of the Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company of New York, top designers of gaslighting fixtures. At this time, due to Thomas Edison's advances in developing the electric light bulb, Archer & Pancoast began manufacturing fixtures using this new technology. 
Leading a major lighting firm, Caldwell faced the challenge of mastering an understanding of electric light and adapting electric fixtures to traditional ornamental esthetics that were acceptable to the late 19th century American public. While at Archer & Pancoast, Caldwell oversaw three major commissions for McKim, Mead, and White, the New York State Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago), The Club of New York City and the Boston Public Library. 
Through these projects, Caldwell became a friend of Stanford White (1853–1906). Stanford White was a young architect who saw the importance that electric illumination would have in designing interiors and buildings. He understood that the new technological advances of slender tubing, small electric bulbs, concealed wiring, modern switch units, and low voltage current linked to small sockets would allow fixtures to take new and diverse forms, sharing decorative as well as utilitarian function. White encouraged Caldwell to become a designer solely of electric light fixtures. He died in 1914.
Edward F. Caldwell & Company.
In 1895, Caldwell established the firm Edward F. Caldwell & Co., Inc. of New York with Victor von Lossberg, at 31 East 17th Street. Von Lossberg, a designer and draftsman that Caldwell had worked with at Archer & Pancoast, was a native of Latvia who was raised in Russia and studied design in Germany. Caldwell and von Lossberg brought skilled artisans from Europe to New York to work for the firm. They frequently traveled to Europe studying and importing historic objects for use as inspiration in the production of their electric light fixtures. 
In 1901, they established their own foundry at 36-40 West 15th Street, along with their showrooms and offices. They quickly became known for producing lighting fixtures and metalwork objects in bronze, iron, silver, brass, and copper. Attracting commissions from some of the most prominent architects of the period including McKim, Mead & White, Carrere & Hastings, Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson, and Cass Gilbert. 
The firm continued under Victor von Lossberg after Edward Caldwell died in October 1914. Edward T. Caldwell, grandson of the founder, took over the firm when von Lossberg retired in 1938. Caldwell & Co. then produced more standardized fixtures and fluorescent lamps until it closed due to financial problems in 1959. 
Caldwell & Co. produced a wide variety of objects based on historic styles since many of their wealthy and established clientele preferred traditional designs. They showed clients photographs and actual historic examples of French, Italian and English forms that could be adapted as electric light fixtures and that would fit esthetically into traditional or period interiors. 
The firm also worked closely with the architects, interior decorators and other subcontractors to coordinate the aesthetic unity of a project, using their extensive photo archive to inspire new designs. A watercolor or colored pencil presentation drawing was then created by Caldwell & Co. to be reviewed by designer and client before the piece was put into production. After a piece was produced, it was often photographed and added to the company's extensive photo archive. The success of the Caldwell firm was due to their ability to have such an extensive variety of historic patterns at hand that could be effectively incorporated into electric fixtures and that would enhance rather than deter the beauty of an interior. 
Under Von Lossberg, the company created more original designs rather than strictly duplicating antiques that had been a standard for the firm previously. Lighting and desk accessories now contained intricate gilding and vitreous enamel work. In the 1920s, the firm also explored more contemporary designs such as Art Deco styles for lights at Radio City Music Hall and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. 
With a staff that numbered more than 1,000 in the early decades of the 20th century, they also had the ability to take on large commissions. As a result, they landed many of the biggest jobs of the day, including new churches, train stations, state capitols, residences and other public buildings throughout the country. 
Much of their work cans still be seen today throughout the country and even abroad.

<doc id="21622303" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21622303" title="Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship">
Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship

The Type R "Mystery Ships" were a series of wire-braced, low-wing racing airplanes built by the Travel Air company in the late 1920s and early 1930s. They were so called, because the first three aircraft of the series (R614K, R613K, B11D) were built entirely in secrecy. 
In total, five Type Rs were built and flown by some of the most notable flyers of the day, including Jimmy Doolittle, Doug Davis, Frank Hawks, and Pancho Barnes, not only in races but also at air shows across the United States, and most notably, by Hawks in Europe.
Design and development.
The environment in air racing at the time was one of give and take with the military. A civilian designer would take an existing aircraft design, modify it for greater speed and enter it in the race. Since the military already had access to the fastest and most advanced aircraft available, it was simply a matter of upping the horsepower on whatever aircraft they were using and the problem was solved. This led to the military completely dominating the air racing scene. In an effort to combat this, two Travel Air designers; Herb Rawdon and Walter Burnham undertook proving that a civilian aircraft built from scratch and designed exclusively for racing (as opposed to combat or passenger/mail service) could out-fly the military.
Under construction during 1928, the aircraft was kept under cover prior to the 1929 Cleveland Air Races, with the builders even going so far painting the windows on the factory to keep the curious press from getting a look at it. The local Wichita paper picked up on the secret program, with one reporter even going so far as to scale a ladder to try to peek into the vents in the factory roof. The paper dubbed it the "Mystery Ship" and the name stuck with R (for Rawdon) added. Rawdon and Burnham both knew that to approach Travel Air CEO Walter Beech would be fruitless, unless they hit him with the idea just before the air racing season began, so they designed the aircraft in their spare time, without pay until they could get Beech to agree to build the type.
During an era when biplanes were still common, the use of a monoplane planform, a NACA engine cowl, and large wheel pants significantly reduced aerodynamic drag, creating a streamlined design. Construction of the fuselage and wings was based on a plywood structure with the thin wings braced with wires. The sleek, polished fuselage continued the shape and width of the cowl throughout, with the cockpit featuring a small windshield, set nearly flush with the skin. A turtle deck extended from the cockpit to the vertical tail creating a fairing for the helmeted head of the pilot. 
The first "Mystery Ship", NR614K (Race No. 31), was designed for both closed course and long distance racing. NR614K had two sets of wings, a shorter set of racing wings, about one and one half foot (.46m) shorter in span and three inches (7.62cm) narrower in chord than the set used for cross country events. R614K was destroyed when it caught fire before the 1931 Thompson Trophy race. The original long wings and tail now reside at the Beechcraft Heritage Museum in Tennessee and are on display at the museum.
The second Type R, NR-613K (Race No. 32) (called the "Mystery S") powered by a six-cylinder D-6 Chevrolair, manufactured by Arthur Chevrolet Aviation Motors Corporation of Indianapolis, Indiana. The six-cylinder air-cooled, inverted inline engine developed 165 hp at 2,175 rpm, and powered NR-613K to a win in the Experimental class at the 1929 National Air Races. NR-613K was later converted back to a radial-engined version by Florence "Pancho" Barnes. Paul Mantz later purchased the aircraft and used it extensively in film work. Years later, Barnes bought it back in an auction where other pilots made sure nobody bid against her. It is currently undergoing restoration in the UK.
The third Mystery Ship, NR-482N (Race No. 35), was purchased by Shell for the use of Jimmy Hazlip and Jimmy Doolittle. NR-614K's short wings were later purchased by Shell and were used, as required, on Doolittle's Race No. 400. NR-482N also crashed and was a complete loss.
The fourth Type R, NR-1313, purchased by the Texaco Company for Frank Hawks as "Texaco 13" became the most famous of the series, setting numerous long distance records both in the United States and internationally. "Texaco 13" is now displayed at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.
A fifth Type R, 11717/MM185, was built at the request of the Italian government several years after the rest, after Hawks toured the European continent. After factory construction and testing, it was subsequently disassembled, shipped by boat to Italy and served as the basis for the Breda Ba.27 fighter. It was later scrapped. The last Type R was built by Travel Air after it had been absorbed by Curtiss-Wright.
Racing.
The Model R series set numerous speed records for both pylon racing and cross country flying, and were the most advanced aircraft of the day, by far outpacing anything that even the military could offer. On September 2, 1929, Doug Davis entered the "Mystery Ship" in the Thompson Cup Race. Davis won at a speed of 194.9 mph (one lap flown at 208.69 mph), beating the military entries, even recircling one of the pylons. This was the first time in the history of air racing that a civilian racer had outperformed a military aircraft.

"Lady, Lady" () was the Spanish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1984, performed in Spanish by the quartet Bravo. 
The song is a melancholy ballad, with lead singer Amaya Saizar telling the story of the titular ""Lady"", a woman who lost her loved one ""and her youth a thousand years ago"", yet every evening she waits patiently for his return. The ""Lady"", in ""her grey sun hat, her starch dress"", her ""Jasmine perfume"" and ""blue eye make-up"" wastes her life waiting and lives ""in her crystal world"".
The song was performed fourth on the night (following France's Annick Thoumazeau with "Autant d'amoureux que d'étoiles" and preceding Norway's Dollie de Luxe with "Lenge Leve Livet"). At the close of voting, it had received 106 points, placing 3rd in a field of 19.
This song was a great success in Spain.
It was succeeded as Spanish representative at the 1985 Contest by Paloma San Basilio with "La fiesta terminó".

Alley of Classics, Chişinău

The Alley of Classics () is a sculptural complex located in the Stephen the Great Park in Central Chişinău, Moldova.
Overview.
The alley is decorated on both sides with red granite busts of classic Romanian literary figures and political leaders from Moldova. The alley is located between the Ştefan cel Mare boulevard and the bronze bust of Alexander Pushkin, set on a granite column and made by Russian sculptor Alexander Opekushin. The alley was built and received its name in 1958 and became one of the most important tourist attractions in Chişinău. At first there were only twelve sculptures but after the fall of the Soviet Union, the local authorities added busts of Romanian and Moldovan writers and poets that were banned during the Soviet regime.
The idea of a sculptural complex was launched by the interwar sculptor Alexandru Plămădeală, who dream to create an open-air museum. Just during the Khrushchev Thaw, the Alley of Classics was unveliled on April 29, 1958 in the Stephen the Great Park (former "A.S. Puşkin" Park). The sculptural complex from Cişmigiu Gardens in Bucharest served as a model.
Busts.
The Alley of Classics contains 28 busts (including that of Alexander Pushkin, lying at the head of the alley) in alphabetical order.

Lipton Institute of Tea

The Lipton Institute of Tea is a dedicated tea research facility owned by consumer goods company Unilever, which also owns the Lipton tea brand. The Institute conducts studies on the mental and physical health benefits of tea. As well as research conducted directly by the Institute, it also funds and coordinates a large number of research projects at academic and research institutions around the world.
Background.
The Lipton Institute of Tea is headquartered in Sharnbrook in Bedfordshire, UK. A formal tea research base was established here by Unilever in 1967. The Institute also has research centres and regional representatives located in major tea growing regions (such as India and Kericho, Kenya, where Unilever owns tea plantations) and other key tea-drinking markets (including France, Japan, China, and the USA). The Institute claims as its mission "to promote awareness and understanding of tea, from bush to cup". The Institute also participates in and organises scientific conferences. 
Integral to the Institute’s research facilities is its operation of what it claims is the world’s most northerly tea plantation at its UK headquarters. This facility enables tea to be studied in a controlled environment, as here representative samples of tea from around the world are grown.
Research.
The Institute invests in clinical trials to support benefit claims, and its scientific understanding of the health benefits of tea. Many of the Institute’s findings have resulted in academic publication.
Recent work has focused on theanine and flavonoid antioxidants, both of which occur naturally in tea and are claimed to have numerous health benefits. The Lipton Institute of Tea has also funded research on heart health and stroke, and in April 2009 published the results of research conducted with the University of L'Aquila, Italy, about tea and cardiovascular health.

Daybreak (Battlestar Galactica)

"Daybreak" is the three-part series finale of the reimagined science fiction television series "Battlestar Galactica", and are the 74th and 75th episodes overall. The episodes aired on the U.S. Sci Fi Channel and SPACE in Canada respectively on March 13 and March 20, 2009. The second part is double-length. The episodes were written by Ronald D. Moore, and directed by Michael Rymer. The Season 4.5 DVD and Blu-ray releases for Region 1 feature an extended version of the finale, which not only combines both parts as a single episode, but also integrates it with new scenes not seen in the aired version of either part. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 1 is 39,516. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 2 is 39,406. At the end of Part 2, Admiral Adama announces the survivor population at approximately 38,000.
The episodes portray the "Galactica" launching a rescue mission to retrieve Hera Agathon from the "colony", a heavily armed and defended Cylon base located near a black hole. They manage to rescue Hera, and in the end, the fleet finds a new planet to settle on, which they come to call Earth (revealed to be our Earth). The final episodes gave "Battlestar Galactica" the strongest ratings since its second season, though they received mixed reviews.
Plot.
Part 1.
Back in the present, "Galactica" is being stripped for parts to be used on other ships, while the military will be transferred to control the Rebel Basestar. The pictures of the fallen in the memorial hallway are also taken down. Baltar wants his people to have a seat on the quorum, but Lee refuses. Admiral Adama later decides to give amnesty to those who took part in the attempted coup d'état, as well as to Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), who is in the brig for helping Boomer (Grace Park) escape. This allows Tyrol to take part in the mission to retrieve Hera (Iliana Gomez-Martinez), who is being studied by the Cylons to determine how Cylons can reproduce. However, Adama doesn't allow Cottle (Donnelly Rhodes) to join in, as he says that the fleet cannot afford to lose a doctor. Several others join in the operation, including the original Cylon models, and a weakened Roslin. A Raptor is dispatched to the possible location of the "Colony", only to find it located very close to a black hole, but despite the circumstance, Adama orders an attack to begin.
Part 2.
In flashback sequences, William Adama and Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) celebrate their upcoming retirement, where Tigh convinces Adama to take his new job. Later, as Adama is questioned in an interview, he complains that no job is worth questioning his loyalty and decides to rejoin the military. Lee has dinner with Zak and Starbuck again. When Zak passes out, drunk, the sexual tension between Kara and Lee nearly erupts before they are interrupted by a stirring Zak. Back home, Lee again encounters the pigeon, but this time he does not chase it. Roslin meets her blind date, who happens to be a former student of hers. After they go back to her apartment, she has second thoughts and ends the date; she then calls Adar's campaign, informing them of her intention to join it. Boomer meets Adama and Tigh for the first time, where she is warned that she is on the verge of ending her career due to her inability to land a Raptor. Given one last chance, Boomer gratefully tells the two that unlike other pilots, she will repay Adama one day. Meanwhile, Baltar, believing that Caprica Six is a corporate spy, allows her access to the military defense mainframe. He says that he is not doing this for her employers, but for her.
Back in the present of the series, Baltar decides to join the mission with Caprica Six at the last minute; she later admits to being proud of him for the first time. It is later revealed that Baltar's Inner Six, and Six's Inner Baltar are aware of each other, and the two real-life counterparts can see both of them. Romo Lampkin (Mark Sheppard) becomes the new president, and Hoshi (Brad Dryborough) is given command of the fleet while Adama and "Galactica" set off to rescue Hera. "Galactica" jumps right next to the colony, where they are immediately fired upon. Some of the Raptors, which are armed with nuclear weapons, make a short jump into the debris field and fly toward the back of the colony; in the process, Racetrack (Leah Cairns) and Skulls (Collin Lawrence) are killed by an asteroid. Anders has been installed into the CIC computers, and disables the Hybrids (Tiffany Lyndall-Knight). "Galactica" rams straight into the colony, where a strike team led by Starbuck searches for Hera. Hera is rescued by Boomer, who kills Simon (Rick Worthy) and finds Starbuck's team. Boomer hands Hera over to Athena (Grace Park) and tells her to, "tell the Admiral I owed him one." After her daughter is returned, Athena kills Boomer.
However, after Hera is returned, "Galactica" must also contend with numerous Cylon boarding parties. Hera is split off from her parents. She is spotted by Roslin, who takes a break from assisting with a triage, and is able to hide her from the Cylons, until she disappears again. While Roslin gives chase, Baltar and Caprica also spot Hera and give chase as well. The chase parallels the Opera House vision shared between Athena, Roslin and Caprica. The chase ends in the CIC, where Cavil (Dean Stockwell) holds her hostage. Inner Six and Inner Baltar again appear jointly to Baltar, inspiring him to make a speech saying, among other things, that he sees angels and convincing Cavil to end the war. The Cylon representatives agree that Cavil will give Hera back and let them leave if the Final Five give Cavil the technology for resurrection.
Part 3.
The Final Five begin the download of the technology for resurrection, with Saul and Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon), Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) dipping their hands into Samuel Anders' (Michael Trucco) amniotic fluid to transfer the data to the Colony. But as they download the info, they can see each other's memories. Tyrol is made aware that Tory murdered his wife, Cally, and kills her in revenge before the downloading is complete. Feeling betrayed, the Cylons resume fighting; after the other Cylons in CIC are killed, Cavil commits suicide. In the debris field, a chance rock strike causes Racetrack's hand to fall on the launch button for her Raptor's nuclear weapons; the missiles strike directly into the colony, knocking it out of orbit. With "Galactica" being dragged toward the singularity along with the colony, Adama orders Starbuck to jump the ship away, anywhere. In a flash of inspiration, Starbuck enters coordinates into the computer as if she were playing the mysterious music, using the notes which Hera had written. "Galactica" jumps away and out of danger, leaving the colony to inevitably fall to its destruction within the black hole.
"Galactica" arrives at Kara's mysterious coordinates, its final destination as the damage caused in the battle has rendered the ship incapable of surviving any further jumps. Miraculously, the "Galactica" finds itself in orbit around a moon, close to a habitable world: our own Earth. 
Hours later, the rest of the fleet has been summoned. Lee makes the unorthodox suggestion that they abandon their technology and start afresh, while Adama and others discover primitive humans already occupying the planet. Since finding Earth was always the goal of the Colonial Fleet, Adama suggests they call this planet Earth. The survivors - "Galactica's" crew, the remaining inhabitants of the fleet, and the Cylon Twos, Sixes and Eights - take basic supplies and spread out across the planet - not to colonize it but to blend in with primitive early humans, leaving Anders to fly the fleet into the Sun. The decision was made not to colonize this time, but to break the cycle. "All this has happened before..." but maybe it won't happen again. Leave it all behind and start over. "We can give them the best part of ourselves, but not the baggage". The Rebel Cylons decide that their Centurions have earned their freedom, and give them control of the Basestar, which jumps away to parts unknown. Starbuck, her destiny fulfilled, literally vanishes without a trace after saying goodbye to Lee.
Baltar and Caprica Six are visited by their Inner messengers, who inform them that their destinies - to save Hera - have been fulfilled, and the two decide to live out the rest of their lives together. Lee expresses his desire to venture off and explore the planet. Tyrol decides to settle by himself on a remote northern island (implied to be the Scottish highlands). Helo (Tahmoh Penikett), Athena and Hera are reunited as a family. Tigh and Ellen stay with the rest of the survivors. Adama leaves with Roslin, but while admiring the wildlife and looking for a place to build a cabin for them, Roslin dies peacefully. Adama finds the place where he will build the cabin, and buries Laura on a nearby hillside.
Epilogue.
New York City, 150,000 years later: humanity has reached the early 21st century, and the development of robotics and computerization continues unabated. Inner Baltar and Inner Six (no longer tied to the long-deceased Gaius Baltar and Caprica Six) comment on the recent discovery of what is believed to be "mitochondrial Eve" in Tanzania... the remains of Hera Agathon, progenitor of modern day humanity. Inner Six disagrees with her counterpart about humanity's next future: when a complex system repeats, something new is bound to happen, and "this" Earth - descendant of devastated planets Kobol, Caprica and the original Earth - may escape the vicious circle of technology, all part of God's plan. "You know it doesn't like that name," Inner Baltar replies, as the two stroll away.
Production.
In the episode's podcast, Moore and his wife Terri commented that they had trouble scouring for robot footage and clearing rights issues. They also described one of the robots as the "most disturbing" of the robots. "She's freaky. She's a Six in the making".
Several bars of Stu Phillips' original "Battlestar Galactica" theme are heard at several junctions in the show, including when Adama flies the last Viper off the "Galactica "and when Anders flies the fleet into the sun. The final shot of the fleet leaving Earth's orbit is an exact recreation of the fleet stock shot from the original series. D'Anna Biers (played by Lucy Lawless) is the only Cylon not to appear in this episode, as her character had stayed on the original 'Cylon' Earth at the end of "Sometimes a Great Notion."
Before entering coordinates on the FTL-drive control console, Starbuck says 'there must be some kind of way out of here' which is the opening lyric of Bob Dylan's song "All Along the Watchtower". The coordinates she enters are revealed through flashbacks to be the numerical representation of the opening notes of that same tune. The song is a recurring motif throughout the fourth season and the version sung by Jimi Hendrix is played at the end of the episode.
The episode was partially shot in the area of Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada.
Show creator Ronald D. Moore appears in a short cameo in the epilogue, as the long haired man reading the fictional edition of National Geographic in which the archaeological story is featured.
Reception.
"Daybreak (Part 2)" was watched by 2.4 million total viewers, a 56% surge from the season three finale and the series' best numbers since the season 2.5 premiere, "Resurrection Ship, Part 1." This led to a 1.7 household rating. The series finale also drew 1.5 million viewers in the key 18-to-49-year-old demographic, and 1.6 million viewers aged 25-to-54, the best in each demographic since "Resurrection Ship, Part 2." The numbers do not take into account timeshifting via digital video recorders, which typically adds another 700,000 "Battlestar Galactica" viewers per episode.
Critical reception of the finale varied. Alan Sepinwall of "The Star Ledger" wrote "so the amazing four-year journey of "Battlestar Galactica" comes to an end, and I feel very, very good about it–even as I suspect others may not." Mary McNamara of the "Los Angeles Times" praised Moore and the writing team for "not copping out" and commented that it was "hard to imagine a more visually and thematically satisfying finale". Richard Vine of "The Guardian" opined that "somehow, out of all the doom and gloom, death, destruction and nihilism we've had, "Battlestar Galactica" finished with something approaching a happy ending." He concluded that the episode was ultimately satisfying, noting that "most of the major questions were dealt with in some form or another."
"Mother Jones" magazine noted that the finale did little to genuinely resolve many plotlines and subplots, and pondered the implications for the industry. Mark Perigard of the "Boston Herald" concluded that "The desire to wrap everything up in a neat package–which is so contrary to the spirit of this show–hobbled the series creators." "Salon Magazine" contrasted the finale with the rest of the series noting that the episode finished with "40 minutes of speeches about lessons learned and the need to "break the cycle", the naiveté of which did indeed feel like a break— from the knowing, worldly stoicism that made "Battlestar Galactica" so refreshing to begin with." "Time Magazine" noted that it seemed hard to believe that an advanced culture would discard all of its technology.
Renowned fantasy author George R.R. Martin expressed his extreme dissatisfaction, commenting: ""Battlestar Galactica" ends with 'God Did It.' Looks like somebody skipped Writing 101, when you learn that a deus ex machina is a crappy way to end a story... Yeah, yeah, sometimes the journey is its own reward. I certainly enjoyed much of the journey with BSG... But damn it, doesn't anybody know how to write an ending any more? Writing 101, kids. Adam and Eve, God Did It, It Was All a Dream? I've seen Clarion students left stunned and bleeding for turning in stories with those endings." Josh Tyler of "Blend Magazine" concluded that the final resolution lacked credibility, but that the simple drama of the episode was one reason to view it positively.

List of hills in the Lake District

This is a list of hills in the Lake District. To avoid the list becoming infinitely long and arbitrary, only hills with more than 30 m relative height (rising over ) are included. This includes most, but not all, Wainwrights as well as many other hills.
Topographically, the boundaries of the Lake District trace the flow of streams from the lowest point between it and the Pennines. This occurs just north of the Howgill Fells and gives the boundaries as, primarily, the River Eden and River Lune. This list therefore includes all hills to the west of those rivers including the so-called 'Westmorland Plateau' to the north of the Howgills.
Hills are grouped as topographically as possible, according to their 'parent Marilyn'. The parent Marilyn of hill A can be found by dividing the nearby area into territories, by tracing the runoff from the key col of each Marilyn. The parent is the Marilyn whose territory hill A resides in. Marilyns are given in bold-faced font.
In the table headers, H stands for height and RH for relative height.

James Nesbitt filmography

James Nesbitt is an actor from Northern Ireland whose filmography encompasses both television and film roles over a 30-year period. Nesbitt's screen career began in the early 1980s with uncredited roles in episodes of the BBC "Play For Today" strand, which he had while attached to the Riverside Theatre's youth group. His first credited role came in 1989, as a bit player in the John Ogdon biopic "Virtuoso", which was followed by his first feature film role in 1991 in "Hear My Song".
As a casual actor in the early 1990s, Nesbitt mixed television and film roles; he appeared in episodes of "Boon", "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles", "Covington Cross", "Lovejoy", and "Between the Lines". He also played roles in several Michael Winterbottom films, beginning with "Loves Lies Bleeding" in 1993 and continuing with "Go Now" in 1995, "Jude" in 1996 and "Welcome to Sarajevo" in 1997.
In 1997, he secured his breakout television role as Adam Williams in "Cold Feet", a character he played until 2003. In that time he also appeared in the film "Waking Ned", two series of "Playing the Field", "Touching Evil", his feature film lead debut "Lucky Break", and Paul Greengrass's controversial television film "Bloody Sunday", as Ivan Cooper. After "Bloody Sunday", Nesbitt started to take on more dramatic roles, appearing in five series of "Murphy's Law" (2003–2007), the two-part television film "Passer By" (2004), Steven Moffat's "Jekyll" (2007), and the Iraq War drama "Occupation" (2009). He has also furthered his feature film career by taking roles in Woody Allen's "Match Point" (2005), the Troubles drama "Five Minutes of Heaven" (2009), the thriller "Outcast" (2010), Nadia Tass's "Matching Jack" (2010), and Emilio Estevez's "The Way" (2010). He starred in the ITV medical drama series "Monroe" (2011–2012) and has a role as the dwarf Bofur in Peter Jackson's "The Hobbit" trilogy (2012–2014).
Nesbitt has also taken on theatrical roles throughout his career; between 1987 and 1994, he appeared in no less than five major plays, including the musical "Up on the Roof", a world tour of "Hamlet", and the Troubles drama "Paddywack". After a break of eleven years, Nesbitt returned to the stage to make his London West End debut in Owen McCafferty's "Shoot the Crow" (2005).

Rod Dickinson (born 1965) is a British artist specialising in re-creations of historical incidents or events. 
Biography.
Dickinson initially trained as a painter. He first gained note in the 1990s for his work involving the creation of crop circles in the UK. He made his first crop circle in 1991, when the interest in extra-terrestrial visits was at its height, and has subsequently completed more than 500 of them. In 2004 he graduated from circles made with cereal crops and created an ambitious design made using sand, followed by a BBC film crew and a helicopter. 
In 2002 he organised The Milgram Obedience Experiment in Glasgow, Scotland, involving reenactment by actors to explore Dickinson's fascination with belief systems and social systems. "The Observer" described the work as "too literal to be theatre, and too darkly strange to fit into the historical battles' re-enactment genre... his work comes closest to the dread realm of performance art."

Forum theatre

Forum theatre is a type of theatre created by the innovative and influential practitioner Augusto Boal as part of what he calls his "Theatre of the Oppressed." Boal created Forum theatre as a forum for teaching people how to change their world. While practicing earlier in his career, Boal would apply 'simultaneous dramaturgy'. In this process the actors or audience members could stop a performance, often a short scene in which a character was being oppressed in some way. The audience would suggest different actions for the actors to carry out on-stage in an attempt to change the outcome of what they were seeing. This was an attempt to undo the traditional actor partition and bring audience members into the performance, to have an input into the dramatic action they were watching. 
In 2006 it has been recorded as the most used way to help new people in the theatre.
Origin and history.
Boal developed and practised an orthodox methodology for forum theatre based on the interaction between his actors and his so-called "spect-actors".
The spect-actor attempts to overturn the oppression using some method unused by the actors, whilst the actors portraying the oppressors improvise to attempt to bring the production to its original, scripted ending. If the audience believes that the spect-actor's actions are too unrealistic to be utilized in reality, they may call out "magic!", and the spect-actor must modify their actions accordingly. If this spect-actor fails in overthrowing the oppression, the actor resumes their character, and continues the production until another spect-actor calls out "stop! or freeze!" and attempts a different method.
If and when the oppression has been overthrown by the spect-actors, the production changes again the spect-actors now have the opportunity to replace the oppressors, and find new ways of challenging the oppressed character. In this way a more realistic depiction of the oppression can be made by the audience, who are often victims of the oppression. The whole process is designed to come to a conclusion through the consideration of opposing arguments, rather than where an argument is one-sided and pushed from the actors with no chance of reply or counter-argument.
Applications.
Since the latter part of the twentieth-century the range of applications and methodologies used in forum theatre has increased and developed. Some practice close to Boal's traditional method continues in the UK, notably undertaken by Adrian Jackson and his Cardboard Citizens company. Participants learning in areas such as management or diversity training can benefit from the usefulness of the technique in helping them to imagine different responses and outcomes to common problems.
Forum Theatre has been modified in practice in several nations where certain portions of the play are pre-written. The play stops at a controversial point, where the spect-actors determine what the fate of the actors will be. In the course, the spect-actors frequently join the play by adding themselves as new characters or replacing older characters and then interact with the actors to find a solution. As the major portion of the play is to be performed impromptu, forum theatre requires profound acting skills from the actors.
The Centre for Community Dialogue and Change (CCDC - www.ccdc.in) is a Bengaluru, India, based organisation which conducts workshops and Forum Theatre performances especially in relation to medical education and patient care both in the hospital and community settings.

Effects of the 2008–10 automotive industry crisis on the United States

Beginning in the latter half of 2008, a global-scale recession adversely affected the economy of the United States. A combination of several years of declining automobile sales and scarce availability of credit led to a more widespread crisis in the United States auto industry in the years of 2008 and 2009.
Following dramatic drops in automobile sales throughout 2008, each of the "Big Three" U.S. automakers – General Motors (GM), Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler – requested emergency loans in order to address impending cash shortages. By April 2009, the situation had worsened such that both GM and Chrysler were faced with imminent bankruptcy and liquidation. With the intent to prevent massive job losses and destabilizing damage to the entire manufacturing sector, the U.S. and Canadian governments provided unprecedented financial bailout ($85 billion) support to allow the companies to restructure and jettison legacy debt via Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Both companies separately filed for this protection by June 1.
General Motors emerged from bankruptcy as a new company majority owned by the United States Treasury, and Chrysler emerged owned primarily by the United Auto Workers union and by Italian automaker Fiat S.p.A.. Both companies terminated agreements with hundreds of their dealerships and GM discontinued several of its brands as part of bankruptcy proceedings. Ford Motor Company was able to survive without entering bankruptcy partly due to a large line of credit which it obtained in 2007.
The U.S. automakers were more heavily affected by the crisis than their foreign counterparts, such as Toyota. Following the 2000s energy crisis, the U.S. automakers failed to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles as opposed to the high-profit sport utility vehicles that were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s which led to excess inventory and undesirable product. Since the automotive crisis abated, all three American automakers have increased sales of vehicles and have posted a profit.
As of 2012, the industry has recovered to some extent. GM had 2011 sales of more than 9 million vehicles, more than Toyota. According to a May 2011 report by the White House National Economic Council, however, the US government may have to write off about $14 billion of its $80 billion loan.
By 2012, polls from Pew Research Center and Quinnipiac University Polling Institute show that the American public now believes that the bailouts have been helpful for the American economy.
Background.
Some note that the crisis occurred mainly as a result of business of the Big Three U.S. automakers which had limited access to offshore production as opposed to their Asian counterparts. Analysts point out that Asian companies that manufacture automobiles mostly Asia but also in the U.S. were not experiencing similar problems. They were able to produce compact automobiles in the Pacific Rim area for less cost (in Dollars). A December 22, 2008 New York Times article stated, "For the most part, the so-called auto transplants – foreign-owned car companies with major operations in the United States – have deep pockets and ample credit, and they are not facing potential bankruptcy like General Motors and Chrysler." Much of the criticism centered on structural differences between the Big Three and the "transplants" (foreign companies manufacturing in U.S.) that result in major cost differentials.
The U.S. Big Three were first weakened by the substantially more expensive automobile fuels linked to the 2003–2008 oil crisis which, in particular, caused customers to turn away from large sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks, the main market of the American "Big Three" (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). The U.S. automakers also suffered from considerably higher labor costs than their non-unionized counterparts, including salaries, benefits, healthcare, and pensions. In return for labor peace, management granted concessions to its unions that resulted in uncompetitive cost structures and significant legacy costs. Further, the volume of cars sold in the U.S. was significantly tied to home equity lines of credit, with 24% of sales financed this way in 2006. When the availability of these loans suddenly dried up in 2008 due to the subprime mortgage crisis, vehicle sales declined dramatically, from 17 million in 2006 to 10.6 million in 2009.
In 2006, "Consumer Reports" reported that all 10 of the cars that it considered to be the 10 best were built by Japanese companies. While Michigan lost 83,000 Big Three auto manufacturing jobs between 1993 and 2008, more than 91,000 new auto manufacturing jobs were created in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Texas during that same time period. Note that 83,000 jobs were lost in Michigan and there is not a reference to automotive jobs lost in other states. Center for Automotive Research estimated that for every job created by a foreign transplant, 6.1 jobs were lost by the Big Three. 
The support given to General Motors and Chrysler by the Obama Administration was initially unpopular, with a March 2009 "CNN"/Opinion Research Corporation poll finding that only 37% of Americans approved of the actions. A June 2009 "Wall Street Journal"/NBC News survey found 39% approval.
However, two polls taken three years after the event show that Americans did eventually support the auto bailout. An April 2012 poll by Quinnipiac University Polling Institute shows that 53% of American voters support the bailout, and 50% believe it has been a success. A Pew Research Center poll from February 2012 shows that 56% of adults polled now believe that the government giving loans to General Motors and Chrysler was "good for the economy".
Industry and Labor statistics.
At the time, the Big Three employees, parts-supplier employees and car-dealer employees totaled approximately 1.6 million. All auto-related industries and after-market service businesses employed approximately 3.1 million people in the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics breaks down the workers into the following segments, as of September 2008: Parts manufacturing-504,000; Repair operations-864,000; Wholesale operations-340,000; Dealer operations-1.2 million; and Manufacturing-114,000. GM directly employs 123,000 in all of North America. An estimated two million people relied on the industry for health care and 775,000 retirees collect auto-industry pensions.
Hourly wages and benefits.
Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution argued that hourly wages were similar between the Big Three and the transplants. "The basic hourly wage received by a UAW worker in a Big Three plant is close to that received by a Toyota or Honda worker in a U.S. plant. The UAW-negotiated wage was roughly $28 an hour in 2007. For new workers, the hourly wage was lower at $14 an hour; senior workers made more money. The major cost difference between UAW members and employees in foreign-nameplate factories in the U.S. comes in fringe benefits. The UAW has been one of the more successful American unions in fighting for generous pensions and health benefits for its members."
Dan Ikenson of the Cato Institute argued that "total compensation is the cost of labor to the companies, and for GM it is about $73 per hour and for Toyota about $48. The average cost differential between the Big Three and all the foreign nameplate companies is about $30 per hour. That's huge." His computation includes all labor-related costs (e.g.., wages, healthcare, and pension—for both current workers and retirees.)
Andrew Sorkin of the "New York Times" indicated that GM and Chrysler pay $10–20 more per hour than transplants; this was vigorously disputed by David Cole of the Center for Automotive Research.
Average annual wages for production workers at the Big Three were $67,480 in 2007, and $81,940 for skilled workers. In Canada, GM’s 2008 average labor costs (including both wages and benefits) were $69 per hour, and Toyota's at $48 per hour, with similar productivity.
According to the Heritage Foundation, the ratio of retirees to workers varies across the Big Three. For each active worker at GM, there were 3.8 retirees or dependents in 2006. At Chrysler, there were 2.0 and at Ford there were 1.6. This means the legacy labor cost burden for GM is significantly greater than its competitors.
Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park’s school of business, testified that the extremely high labor and product development costs will keep the Big Three from developing the high quality vehicles needed to become profitable and surviving.
The Asian-owned companies' U.S. employees are mainly non-unionized; the Big Three are bound by contracts with the UAW.
According to the UAW, labor cost represented 8.4% of the total cost of manufacturing and selling an automobile in 2006. "The vast majority of the costs of producing a vehicle and transporting it to a dealership and preparing it for sale – including design, engineering, marketing, raw materials, executive compensation and other costs – are not related to direct or indirect manufacturing labor."
Jared Bernstein, the chief economist of Vice President Joe Biden, noted in an April 7, 2009 interview that most of the concessions that the UAW made in the 2007 contract applied only to new hires. Older workers "still benefit from contracts that were signed a long time ago."
Jobs Bank costs.
The "Detroit News" published a story in 2005 on how the Big Three U.S. automakers paid more than 12,000 idled employees their full salary and benefits in "jobs bank" programs. The program was established in the 1984 UAW labor contracts with the Big Three to protect workers' salaries and discourage layoffs, as part of the automakers' contracts with the UAW. The union's intent was to protect jobs via a plan to guarantee pay and benefits for union members whose jobs were extinguished by technological progress or plant restructurings. In most cases, workers are paid via the jobs bank only after exhausting government and company unemployment benefits. Some of those workers were placed in retraining.
As a result of the Jobs Banks, the U.S. automakers are contractually obligated to pay 85–95 percent of union wages and benefits to members of the United Auto Workers union who aren’t working – even if their plants have been closed. In the agreement, GM would to allocate $2.1 billion in Jobs Bank payments over four years, Chrysler $451 million for its program along with another $50 million for salaried union employees, and Ford agreed to set aside $944 million. Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park’s school of business, testified that the Jobs Bank was one of the biggest problems that the Big Three face, saying “Right now if a plant closes in St. Louis and a new one opens in Kansas City, the workers don’t have to move from St. Louis to Kansas City; they can opt to get a $105,000 payout or go on Jobs Bank where they can collect 95 percent of pay for the rest of their lives.”
Number of brands.
GM had eight brands sold in the United States (not including its overseas brands Vauxhaul, Opel, Holden and at the time GM Daewoo which is now called GM Korea) until it sold three and liquidated one of those brands during bankruptcy, leaving four (Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick), while Toyota has only three. More brands require additional marketing and product development expenditures, which drives incremental costs relative to the competition. One analyst estimated that reducing GM brands from 8 to 3 would save $5 billion annually.
However, reducing the number of brands required closing or consolidation of dealerships, which due to state franchise laws is very expensive. For example, GM's retirement of the Oldsmobile brand cost nearly $2 billion.
Number and control of dealerships.
GM and Chrysler have nearly 10,000 dealerships between them, employing an estimated 500,000 people. GM has many more, smaller dealerships spread across its eight brands than Toyota. Dealerships are protected by state laws that make them difficult to close without paying large fees. This makes dealership reform challenging without bankruptcy protection.
Bondholders.
GM was carrying a $43 billion debt burden, with nearly $3 billion per year in interest costs. If bondholders swapped stakes for common stock (equity) which pays no interest, GM's debt and interest burden would be substantially reduced.
However, bondholders of both Chrysler and GM rejected the debt swap offers, complaining of unequal treatment compared to the UAW, citing that their outstanding debt was more than double that of the UAW's health care trust. The UAW had been offered 50% and 40% stakes in the new Chrysler and GM, respectively, while the bondholders would have received 33 cents on the U.S. dollar for Chrysler and 10% of the new GM (an analyst stated that the GM offer would be projected to recover 24 cents on the dollar). With the approval of the Treasury, the offer for bondholders was later amended to include warrants for a further 15% stake.
Bondholders complained of US government interference that bypassed the higher precedence of debtholder claims to favour the UAW, due to the UAW's political contributions to President Barack Obama. One lawyer for the Chrysler bondholders stated that auto task force head Steve Rattner had ignored negotiation requests from the bondholders committee, while Rattner also threatened to destroy one of the bondholder's reputation for holding out. One GM bondholder described this as the socialist state intervention typical of Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, saying "This is the kind of stuff you'd expect from a banana republic. Not from the United States."
Obama publicly accused Chrysler bondholders of being speculators, after they rejected the last offer which caused Chrysler to file for bankruptcy, with some of them receiving death threats after a bankruptcy judge refused to protect their anonymity. The hedge funds stated that their clients included pension funds and university endowments. Around $7 billion USD of GM bonds are held by "Mom and Pop-type investors", with one lawyer describing it as autoworker retirees versus retirees.
Not surprisingly, any recapitalization (typically through bankruptcy) would all but wipe out the value of existing common stock shares, which had already declined significantly.
Economic Impact.
Claims that failure would be harmful to economy.
The auto industry is a key component of the U.S. economy. Economists used 2007–2008 data to build estimates of what a shutdown would cost in summer 2008, in order to set benchmarks to help policy makers understand the impact of bankruptcies. Such estimates were widely discussed among policy makers in late 2008. Closing the Big Three would mean loss of 240,000 very highly paid jobs at the Big Three, a loss of 980,000 highly paid jobs at the suppliers and local dealers, plus the loss of 1.7 million additional jobs throughout the economy—a total loss of 3 million jobs.
Estimates were that a Big Three shutdown would cause a decline in personal income of $151 billion the first year, and $398 billion over three years. The federal, state and local governments would lose tax revenue, and instead spend on welfare programs a total of $156 billion over three years.
Economist David Wyss of S&P has posited that if GM and Chrysler disappear, there could be an increase of about 1 million imported cars every year, which would remove about $25 billion from the U.S. economy. That would reduce GDP by 0.2 percentage points annually—excluding the impact of lost jobs (higher unemployment) and wages.
Claims that failure would not be harmful to economy.
In a November 19, 2008 CNBC article, Jordan Kimmel, a fund manager at Magnet Investing in Randolph, New Jersey, said that if the Big Three automakers were liquidated or completely shut down, foreign companies such as Honda and Toyota would open up new manufacturing plants in the U.S., and there would be no long term loss in employment or damage to the economy.
Michael Schuman of Time Magazine stated that although a giant corporation failing would be ugly, it is better than artificially keeping it alive without a prospect of improvement. He compared the possible collapse of the U.S. domestic automakers to the 1999 dismantling of the Daewoo Group in South Korea. Daewoo's proportionate economic impact on Korea was larger than that of the Big Three to the United States. The persistence of the belief that Daewoo and other Korean conglomerates were too big to fail led many bankers and investors to continually waste money on bailouts, despite their poor business plans and unprofitable projects, as Daewoo was unable to repay these loans. Once the too-big-to-fail perception was dispelled, with large conglomerates no longer considered the safest investments, bankers and investors began financing new opportunities in areas which had been starved of capital (small firms, entrepreneurs and consumers), while Korea's GDP actually rose after Daewoo's unwinding. Schuman also noted a similar analogy with Japan during its Lost Decade of the 1990s, where banks kept injecting new funds into unprofitable "zombie firms" to keep them afloat, arguing that they were too big to fail. However, most of these companies were too debt-ridden to do much more than survive on further bailouts, which led to an economist describing Japan as a "loser's paradise." Schuman states that Japan's economy did not begin to recover until this practice had ended.
Restructuring process alternatives.
Industry experts, academics, and media outlets made a variety of recommendations regarding reforming or restructuring the Big Three. Many of these include bankruptcy, a court-supervised method of reorganizing or shutting-down a company.
Bankruptcy in the Auto Industry and Alternatives.
Bankruptcy discussions centered around the prospect of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, commonly called restructuring, commonly used to provide a window of opportunity for a corporation to renegotiate contracts, sell assets or component businesses for cash, obtain debt forgiveness, or otherwise reform itself as a viable business enterprise. The alternative, Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is used to shut down and liquidate an enterprise and sell off the pieces, with the proceeds going to the debt holders. Under both types of bankruptcy, the shareholders typically lose their investment and debt holders obtain control of the corporation. During November 2008, the debate involved whether a Chapter 11 filing would be beneficial or feasible.
Arguments in favor of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
In a November 19, 2008, editorial in "Forbes", Blythe McGarvie said that bankruptcy would allow the automobile industry to become more competitive and sustainable, and cited the airline industry bankruptcy as an example.
Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel, author of the book "The Future for Investors," asserted that Chapter 11 bankruptcy would allow Detroit to reorganize but not cause the massive job losses feared by some. "Any bailout of the auto industry is really a bailout for the health benefits of the UAW. That's all it is."
Opponents of a bailout believe that the automakers' problems could be more efficiently resolved by a bankruptcy court with legal power to dissolve existing contracts, shedding costs, and debts that it can no longer afford. They suggested that a government "car czar" would be ineffective since their actions could be swayed by Washington politics.
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, running in the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012, confirmed that he had favored bankruptcy rather than government aid to the industry, though he had favored the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) as a whole.
Arguments against Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Critics of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy as a restructuring process argued that consumers would be unwilling to purchase a car from a bankrupt automaker, as the ability of the automaker to support the warranty is key to the purchase decision. Advocates have argued that the government or private lenders could establish a fund to enable warranty coverage.
GM argued that a bankruptcy would threaten jobs and the solvency of the U.S. federal government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). PBGC Director has said: "GM has not been able to give us a straight answer about the funded status of their pension plan. We can't successfully monitor the situation if they are not responsive."
GM's pension fund had enough money for current obligations, but a report issued by the a Deutsche Bank estimates that the pension may be $18 billion under-funded by the end of 2008.
Feasibility of a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
A "prepackaged" Chapter 11 bankruptcy means that the key stakeholders have agreed in advance what will happen during the bankruptcy proceedings, which enables greater certainty regarding the outcome and less time spent in bankruptcy protection. Advocates have indicated this would be preferable, while critics argued it was unlikely that all of the stakeholders could agree on terms while outside of bankruptcy.
Government facilitated sale of assets.
The Brookings Institution advocated a government-facilitated solution in which Big Three assets are transferred or sold to other firms better able to deploy the plant and employee resources. " most constructive role the government can play at this point is to provide a short-term infusion of capital with strict repayment rules that will essentially require the auto makers to sell off their assets to other, successful companies." The authors argued that the Big Three make automobiles that not enough Americans want to buy, which cannot be solved by a bankruptcy restructuring focused initially on cost-side considerations like wages and benefits.
Government facilitated restructuring.
Economist and author Jeffrey Sachs has advocated a government and private industry partnership to transform the automotive industry, creating a "high mileage vehicle economy" based on hybrid and fuel cell cars. Loans would be provided immediately, with conditions. He advocates a U.S. strategy of automotive technological leadership, which would "dramatically improve energy and national security, climate security, and U.S. global competitiveness."
Arguments against government intervention.
On November 24, 2008, Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) wrote, "In bailing out failing companies, they are confiscating money from productive members of the economy and giving it to failing ones. By sustaining companies with obsolete or unsustainable business models, the government prevents their resources from being liquidated and made available to other companies that can put them to better, more productive use. An essential element of a healthy free market, is that both success and failure must be permitted to happen when they are earned. But instead with a bailout, the rewards are reversed – the proceeds from successful entities are given to failing ones. How this is supposed to be good for our economy is beyond me... It won’t work. It can’t work... It is obvious to most Americans that we need to reject corporate cronyism, and allow the natural regulations and incentives of the free market to pick the winners and losers in our economy, not the whims of bureaucrats and politicians."
In a December 17, 2008 opinion column, economist Thomas Sowell said that there was no bailout for the horse and buggy industry 100 years ago when it was replaced by the automobile, and that the overall standard of living is higher when winners and losers are determined by customers instead of by politicians. He also blamed the decline of the Big Three on the economic policies of the "rust belt" states, and said that Japanese car companies preferred to build factories in other U.S. states that were not so hostile to businesses.
In a June 16, 2009 report Ernst & Young stated: "Policies that protect firms or industries can result in reduced incentives for entrepreneurs to invest in innovative ideas and for large firms to invest in R&D because they no longer face the competitive pressure to constantly improve their product in order to improve (or maintain) their market share."
Changes to management and board.
Critics argued for the removal of General Motors' senior management. Such removal is typical in a bailout.
Mergers.
If one or more of the Big Three could have merged, enabling cost savings and focusing on the most profitable brands. However, the UAW and CAW opposed this move, as it would certainly involve layoffs. GM and Chrysler held talks which ultimately went to nothing, with Chrysler, as of June 10, 2009, a fully owned subsidiary of Italian automaker Fiat.
Comparison with British Leyland.
The comparison was made with the situation of British Leyland (itself an amalgamation of many car makers similar to General Motors) in the 1970s, which at the time had a 36% market share in the UK. During that period, the UK government nationalised and invested several billion pounds into the ailing business which, faced with competition from Mainland Europe and questionable build quality, the business struggled to compete. While the business slimmed its product line, concentrated mainly on the profitable Austin and Rover brands and by the 1980s had some successful models such as the Austin Metro, the brand ended up being broken up and is now owned by Nanjing Automobile and has largely been dismantled.
Federal Government bailout process and timeline.
On November 19, 2008, there was a United States Senate hearing on the automotive crisis in the presence of the heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. The auto manufacturers explained that they would need financial aid of $25 billion if they were to avoid bankruptcy. The Senate was divided on the issue. The Republican senators were unwilling to provide aid, some even suggesting that bankruptcy might be the best option as it would free manufacturers from the employment deals agreed with the unions. The Democrats, however, continued to insist that action needed to be taken quickly, in line with President-elect Obama's stance on the matter. Rick Wagoner, head of General Motors, estimated that there could be a loss of 3 million jobs within the first year if the auto industry failed. "This is all about a lot more than just Detroit. It's about saving the U.S. economy from a catastrophic collapse," he said.
At the November 19, 2008 hearing, Gary Ackerman (D-NY) said, "Maybe you can tell us what you're actually going to do to sell cars people want," and Michael Capuano (D-Mass) said, "My fear is you're going to take this money and continue the same stupid decisions you've made for 25 years."
On November 20, General Motors shares fell to the lowest price since the Great Depression as the chances of a bail-out diminished. Ford shares also fell drastically. The shares later recovered as there were rumors of bipartisan progress on some kind of a bailout.
A November 20, 2008 Detroit Free Press article said that the UAW was considering ending its jobs bank program as a condition for a federal bailout.
Democratic Congressional party leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid sent a letter to the CEO's of the Big Three automakers calling on these leaders to present by December 2, 2008, a "credible restructuring plan" involving "significant sacrifices and major changes to way of doing business," to qualify for further government assistance. The letter included a variety of principles and requirements, including a situation assessment, forecasts under various assumptions, taxpayer protection, transparent reporting to an oversight body, dividend and executive pay restrictions, and approach to covering healthcare and pension obligations.
On December 2, 2008, the Big Three submitted revised plans to Congress which apparently included more drastic measures such as the lowering of executive pay, reducing the number of brands and refinancing company debt. It emerged that the total amount of the bailout requested had now risen to $34 billion. Painting an even more dramatic picture of what would happen if Congress did not respond quickly, Chrysler said it would need $7 billion by the end of the month just to keep running while GM asked for $4 billion immediately.
In an interview that was broadcast on NBC's Meet The Press on December 7, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama said, "The last thing I want to see happen is for the auto industry to disappear, but I'm also concerned that we don't put $10 billion or $20 billion or $30 billion or whatever billion dollars into an industry, and then, six months to a year later, they come back hat in hand and say, `Give me more.'"
Congressional bailout bill.
On December 9, 2008, negotiators revealed the terms of an emerging deal between the White House and Congress under which a short-term $15 billion bailout for the Big Three would be overseen by a federal "car czar" or trustee.
On December 10, 2008, the House Financial Services Committee released a copy of the proposed financial bailout package for GM, Ford, and Chrysler. The bill proposed the appointment of a 'car czar' to oversee automakers' restructuring efforts, and restrictions on executive bonuses, golden parachute packages and required automakers to sell or divest themselves of any privately owned or leased aircraft.
Senate rejects bailout.
On December 11, the bill failed to pass, losing 52–35 on a Senate procedural vote. A statement from GM expressed its deep disappointment with the failure and said, "We will assess all of our options to continue our restructuring and to obtain the means to weather the current economic crisis." Chrysler said that it "is obviously disappointed in what transpired in the Senate and will continue to pursue a workable solution to help ensure the future viability of the company."
Bush approves bailout.
On December 19, George W. Bush announced that he had approved the bailout plan, which would give loans of $17.4 billion to U.S. automakers GM and Chrysler, stating that under present economic conditions, "allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action." Bush provided $13.4 billion now, with another $4 billion available in February 2009. Funds would be made available from the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. General Motors would get $9.4 billion, and Chrysler $4 billion.
However, it had been argued that the Treasury lacked the statutory authority to direct TARP funds to the automakers, since TARP is limited to “financial institutions" under Section 102 of the TARP. It was also argued that providing TARP funds to automaker's financing operations, such as GMAC, runs counter to the intent of Congress for limiting TARP funds to true "financial institutions". On December 19, 2008, President Bush used his executive authority to declare that TARP funds may be spent on any program he personally deems necessary to avert the financial crisis, and declared Section 102 to be nonbinding.
The federal loan would prevent General Motors from going into immediate bankruptcy. The bailout required both companies to dramatically restructure their operations to demonstrate long-term viability. In February 2009, the Obama administration would determine the automakers' progress in meeting the conditions of the loans, and then decide whether to supply more government aid or to force automakers to repay the loans and face bankruptcy. The loans would carry an interest rate of 5 percent but may rise to 10 percent if the auto manufacturers default on them.
Obama Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry.
Under the Obama Administration, the idea of a car czar was considered and ultimately abandoned in favor of joint Lawrence Summers/Timothy Geithner oversight of a possible second round of lending to the auto companies. In mid-Feb., the auto companies GM and Chrysler in fact did apply for additional funds.
The Task Force was formed in February 2009 instead, and began meetings at that time.
Second bailout.
On February 18, 2009, General Motors and Chrysler again approached the U.S. government, in regard to obtaining a second bridging loan of $21.6 billion (£15.2 billion). $16.6 billion of this would go to General Motors, while Chrysler would take $5 billion. General Motors agreed to shed 47,000 jobs, close five plants, and axe 12 car models. Chrysler agreed to cut 3,000 jobs, cut one shift from production, and axe three car models. General Motors was also looking to sell its Swedish subsidiary, Saab. GM made no mention of plans for its German subsidiary, Opel, or its British subsidiary, Vauxhall.
Obama Address to Joint Session of Congress.
In his joint address to Congress in 2009, Obama stated that
"We will invest fifteen billion dollars in technologies like...more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America. As for auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decision-making and global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink. We should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices. But we are committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto industry that can compete and win. Millions of jobs depend on it. Scores of communities depend on it. And I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk from it"
Chrysler bankruptcy.
On April 30, 2009, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after talks with lenders broke down. On the May 14, 2009 Chrysler announced it was to close 25% of its US dealerships as part of its restructuring process.
Bankruptcy of General Motors.
Only days after approaching the U.S. Government to seek further funding, General Motors published its losses for the final quarter of 2008 to be at $9.6 billion (£6.7 billion). This brought its overall 2008 losses to $30.9 billion. In 2007, General Motors made a loss of $38.7 billion. In the light of the published losses GM has conceded that it expected auditors to question its future viability when it releases its annual report in March.
On the June 1, 2009, General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after failing to successfully negotiate deals with bond holders. On the day the application was made, General Motors was largely a nationalized institution (the U.S. government owning 60% and the Canadian 12.5%), the remaining private stakes mainly being owned by employees. The application to a court in New York marked the largest failure of an industrial company in US history. The restructuring would drastically change General Motors, with at least 20,000 US employees likely to lose their jobs. General Motors had previously announced that another nine plants will be closed while three more will be idled. GM's chief executive Fritz Henderson appealed to customers to give the company another chance, claiming ""the GM that let too many of you down is now history"".
A May 18, 2009 article in The Washington Post said that seven weeks after the Obama administration fired GM CEO G. Richard Wagoner Jr., Wagoner had still not received the $20 million severance package that the company had contractually promised him.
During a June 9, 2009 interview, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the new chairman of GM, said, "I don’t know anything about cars [...] A business is a business, and I think I can learn about cars. I’m not that old, and I think the business principles are the same.” "
Amount of investment.
A February 18, 2009 CNN article said the bailout could cost U.S. taxpayers $130 billion, but this number does not consider that monies recovered later.
As of early June 2009, the Bush and Obama administrations had invested $80.3 billion.
On May 24, 2011, Chrysler repaid the last of the money to the U.S. and Canadian treasuries, several years ahead of schedule.
Image issues.
Issues involving the public image of the companies involved in this crisis also played key parts during the process.
GM ad an apology and a recommitment.
On December 8, 2008, General Motors unveiled a new advertisement where the company apologized for disappointing and violating the trust of American consumers. They pledged to make a commitment to regain focus on core brands and away from pickups and SUVs, declaring they needed to make such an unfiltered statement "since quite a bit of media commentary has not kept pace with our actual progress to transform the company."
November 19 Congressional hearing.
According to ABC News and other media outlets, the Big Three CEOs (Rick Wagoner of GM, Alan Mulally of Ford and Robert Nardelli of Chrysler) who attended the November 19, 2008, meeting in Washington D.C. to request a bailout traveled to the meeting in private luxury jet aircraft. A November 19 CNN article noted that "Gary Ackerman, D-NY... and several other representatives suggested that it was difficult to give money to the automakers when the CEOs had all flown to Washington on corporate jets. 'Those types of symbolic things matter and set a tone,' said Peter Roskam, R-Ill." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi summed up the Congressional response to their requests with the statement "Until they show us the plan, we cannot show them the money," and demanded that the automakers return to submit convincing turnaround plans by Dec. 2.
A November 19, 2008, CNN article quoted Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, as saying, "They're coming to Washington to beg the taxpayers to help them. It's unseemly to be running around on a $20,000 flight versus a $500 round trip." The article noted that although it was not known how much the private flights cost, analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group said that $20,000 was a reasonable estimation.
On December 2, 2008, it was reported that General Motors and Ford were planning to sell their fleets of corporate luxury jets.
Hybrid electric vehicle usage.
Wagoner, Mulally and Nardelli each drove separately to Washington for a December 2 Congressional hearing in hybrid electric vehicles after the above-noted criticism for arriving to Washington for the November hearing in private jets. Wagoner rode in a Chevrolet Malibu hybrid accompanied by Beth Lowery, the company's top environmental and safety official. Mulally travelled in a Ford Escape Hybrid. Nardelli arrived in a Chrysler Aspen Hybrid.
Non-ecological past practices.
From the energy-conservation point of view the Big Three have a negative image. There are ecology-minded sections of the American public that view with little sympathy the big automakers' background of maximizing profits by deliberately destroying mass-transport systems and privately owned railways between the 1920s and '60s.
Some have alleged that The Big Three contributed to the development of suburbs, seen as fuel-inefficient in that it requires commuters to drive to cities from increasingly more distant suburbs. Facing a saturated car market in the U.S. in the early 1920s, GM engaged in a controversial policy along with road-builders that triggered the massive shift from the mass transportation of the previous century to the "one-person-one-car" trip of today.
Bond ratings downgraded.
On December 19, 2008, Fitch Ratings downgraded the Issuer Default Rating of General Motors and Chrysler to "C," indicating "default is imminent."
A December 22, 2008, article from Bloomberg reported that General Motors and Ford "had their debt cut further below investment status by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service. GM’s unsecured debt was trimmed one level to C, or 11 grades below investment quality, by S&P. Moody’s lowered its rating on $26 billion in Ford debt by two grades to Caa3, or nine below investment quality."
Lobbying and other financial ties between Big Three and Congress.
The Big Three spent almost $50 million to lobby Congress during the first nine months of 2008. Senator Carl Levin (D-Michigan) received $438,304 over 30 years, or $14,610 a year. House member John Dingell (D-Michigan) received nearly $1 million over his 54 years in Congress, or $18,518 a year. House member Joe Knollenberg (R-Michigan) received $879,327 over only 16 years in office, or $54,957 a year. Dingell's wife Debbie used to work as a lobbyist for General Motors, and after she married Dingell, she became a senior GM executive at an undisclosed salary. As of May 2008, Dingell owned GM stock worth up to $350,000, GM stock options worth up to $1 million more, and a GM pension fund. In 2000, the Dingells owned GM stock options worth up to $5 million. In 1998, Dingell sold GM stock options worth up to $1 million. The value of that stock, options and pension has been lost in the bankruptcy restructuring that Congress approved for GM.
GM sent letters to tens of thousands of their dealers, supplier executives, employees and union members, asking recipients to call and write Congress with several "talking points" about the potential effects of a GM bankruptcy.
Corporate turnaround proposals and strategies.
Products: electric and hybrid vehicles.
Detroit's "Big Three" automakers went to Washington, D.C., on December 2 (arriving in Washington in hybrids after being criticized for traveling to the earlier November Senate hearing in private jets) to present their long-term viability plans to the United States Congress, and those plans included significant commitments to fuel-saving and electric vehicle technologies.
Ford Motor Company unveiled an aggressive plan to electrify its fleet of vehicles, including plans to offer an all-electric van-type vehicle in 2010 for use in commercial fleets, complemented by a battery-powered sedan in 2011. By 2012, the company will bring a family of regular hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and battery electric vehicles to market. Ford intends to invest about $14 billion on fuel-efficient technologies over the next seven years and aims to achieve a 36% improvement in fuel economy for its entire fleet by the 2015 model year. The company has applied to DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program for $5 billion to support these efforts, but the company also sought up to $9 billion in bridge loans. However, Ford expected to remain viable through 2009 and hopes to avoid drawing on the loan.
GM unveiled the production version of the Chevy Volt in September. The vehicle will be able to travel up to 40 miles in all-electric mode. General Motors Corporation (GM) is involved in a well-publicized effort to launch its plug-in hybrid model, the Chevy Volt, in 2010, and the company also intends to employ the Volt drivetrain in other vehicles. GM plans to launch predominately fuel-efficient cars and crossovers over the next four years, investing $2.9 billion in fuel-efficient technologies and alternative fuels during that time period. By 2012, GM will offer 15 hybrid models, and more than half of its fleet will be flex-fuel vehicles, able to run on either gasoline or ethanol-rich E85. GM is seeking $12 billion in bridge loans through 2009 and is also asking for revolving credit of $6 billion that it could draw on if its sales forecast falls short. The company ended the third quarter of the year with cash reserves of $16 billion, but it estimates that it should have at least $11 billion on hand to maintain its operations. Without a federal loan, GM expects its cash reserves to fall to $10.1 billion by year's end and to fall to $3.6 billion by February.
Chrysler LLC predicted that for the 2009 model year, 73% of its vehicles will be more fuel efficient than their 2008 models, and the company planned to launch more small, fuel-efficient vehicles in the future. The company's plan also called for the introduction of a Dodge Ram hybrid in 2010, along with the company's first electric-drive vehicle. Chrysler also planned to offer three additional electric-drive vehicles by 2013. And like GM, Chrysler planned to make half of its fleet flex-fuel capable by 2012. The company sought a bridge loan of $7 billion. Chrysler ended the first half of the year with $9.4 billion in cash, but expected to end the year with only $2.5 billion in cash, and was concerned that it might not make it through the first quarter of 2009 without the loan.
Automakers have already submitted applications for more than $20 billion in retooling loans to pay for fuel efficient vehicle projects.
Production capacity: factory closings.
On December 12, 2008, General Motors announced that it was temporarily closing 20 factories in North America. On December 17, Chrysler announced it would idle all 30 of its plants for at least one month.
GM will invest $1 billion of bailout money in Brazil.
A February 2, 2009 article in the Latin American Herald Tribune said that General Motors would invest $1 billion in Brazil, and that this money is part of the bailout that it received from the U.S. government.
Brand Consolidation.
General Motors' plan was to consolidate their portfolio of US brands, concentrating on the Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick and GMC brands, while phasing out, or possibly selling their Pontiac, Hummer and Saturn brands.
On June 2, GM Motors announced the sale of the Hummer brand of off-road vehicles to Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd, a deal which fell through after failing to obtain Chinese regulatory approvals. The last Hummer H3 rolled off the line at Shreveport on May 24, 2010.

Douwe Aukes

Douwe Aukes (1612–1668) was a Frisian sea captain of the Dutch East India Company or VOC. The Douwe Aukes class minelayer and its name-ship the HNLMS "Douwe Aukes" were named after him.
Life.
He was the son of another VOC captain, also called Douwe Aukes. He made several trips to South Africa on the ships "Maastricht" and "Vrede" and in 1641 he was made captain of the 40-gun "Vogelstruys" of the VOC's Amsterdam Chamber, which was seconded to Michiel de Ruyter's fleet in 1652 during the First Anglo-Dutch War (with Aukes thus indirectly becoming a naval officer). At one point during the Battle of Plymouth he wandered from the Dutch fleet and was almost surrounded by English ships, but Aukes threatened to ignite a powder keg and blow up the ship, rather than surrender. His crew then managed to beat off an English boarding party, almost sink two English ships, badly damage a third and finally regain the main Dutch fleet.
After the war Aukes continued as a VOC captain, being mentioned in a 1657 document as the captain of a koopvaarder (merchant ship) trading with the Levant and in one from 1665 as a merchant in Amsterdam. When Tjerk Hiddes de Vries was killed in 1666, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Aukes was requested to replace him as lieutenant-admiral in the Admiralty of Friesland by the States of Friesland, but Aukes declined, being then on the return voyage from India, during which he died. He is buried in Amsterdam's Oude Kerk.

Marco Kroon

Captain Marinus Johannes "Marco" Kroon, RMWO (Den Bosch, 15 July 1970) is a Dutch soldier serving with the Korps Commandotroepen. Kroon is a Knight of the Military William Order (MWO) and the first new member of this very exclusive Order in over half a century. The Military William Order is the highest honour in the Netherlands, bestowed for "performing excellent acts of Bravery, Leadership and Loyalty in battle".
Personal life.
Kroon was born in Den Bosch and graduated high school there in 1989, at the Sint-Janslyceum. He still lives in Den Bosch with his girlfriend who runs a café. Besides his full-time job in the military, Kroon often helps her with her work.
Kroon also graduated from the Koninklijke Militaire School ("Royal Military School", which trains NCO's) in Weert, and from the Koninklijke Militaire Academie ("Royal Military Academy", which trains officers) in Breda.
Military career.
Marines.
After graduating from high school in 1989, Kroon started his military career as a Marine in the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps. In 1991 he was dispatched for Operation Provide Comfort, a humanitarian operation for Kurds in northern Iraq. After this he was transferred for a year to the Marine Barracks Savaneta in Aruba. In 1993 he was sent out a second time as assistant section leader in a Marine platoon for the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in Cambodia.
Army.
After this mission in Cambodia he transferred to the Army where he started training for a position as an NCO at the Koninklijke Militaire School in Weert. After graduating he became squad leader at the 17th Armoured Infantry Battalion in Oirschot. With this unit he left for a mission in Bosnia for six months leading an infantry group.
In 1998 he transferred to the Korps Commandotroepen ("Corps of Commando Troops") in Roosendaal. After successfully earning his Green Beret he fulfilled a management position in the corps. In 2000 he once again left for Bosnia, this time as a member of the Joint Commissioned Observer mission. After this mission he left again for the Koninklijke Militaire Academie ("Royal Military Academy") in Breda, to become an officer. After graduation he returned to his unit, the 17th Armoured Infantry Battalion, and left for Bosnia for the third time, now as platoon commander, in the Stabilization Force (SFOR) mission.
In 2004 he returned to the Special Forces in Roosendaal as platoon commander at the 108th Commando Company. Here he had several management positions and was dispatched once again to Iraq in 2004 for mission Stabilisation Force Iraq and three times to Afghanistan (2005, 2006 en 2007).
After that Kroon became a staff officer at the intelligence centre of the special forces, training other commandos, testing equipment and tactical procedures.
On 12 July 2012, Kroon received a new command as company commander of the Charley Company of the 17th Mechanized Infantry Battalion ‘Prinses Irene’ Fusilier Guards Regiment based in Oirschot.
On 4 November 2013, Kroon returned to the Korps Commandotroepen ("Corps of Commando Troops") in Roosendaal.
On the 24th of Februari the Telegraaf newspaper published an article about Kroon. It claimed that Captain Kroon would be joining the Dutch mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Based in Gao, in a staff function as a planner for the 105th Commando Troop Compagny, his job will be mainly planning long range reconnaissance missions. This news was confirmed by the commander of the Korps Commando Troepen, Colonel Jan Swillens.
Military William Order.
From March 2006, to August 2006, Kroon, then a lieutenant, was dispatched to the Afghan province of Uruzgan. His job, as platoon commander of the Dutch special forces unit "Viper", was to reconnoiter and to map the area so that Task Force Uruzgan could be established. In this period he distinguished himself by exceptional deeds during six extremely dangerous actions which broke out during ISAF patrols by "Viper" and a platoon of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment.
One of these actions was Operation Chitag (13–14 July 2006). During the patrol, Kroon encountered a group of Taliban fighters. In the ensuing battle, while the Dutch troops were heavily outnumbered, Kroon was forced to request air support on his own position by a Lockheed AC-130 gunship; he ordered his men to take cover and with his Forward Air Controller (FAC) guided the American air attack. At such close quarters, however, it was a harrowing experience for Kroon and his FAC. Later, his platoon was forced to take cover in an Afghan house, whence they repulsed repeated attacks during the night. No men fell under Kroon's command, but the resulting Taliban losses were severe.
After the dawn, Kroon and his men emerged to retrieve intelligence from the dead Talibani to establish their identity. Kroon disciplined his men after noticing their agitation and inclination toward unprofessional behaviour (he later said that he understood the behaviour of his men but, as their leader, felt himself responsible for ensuring that the platoon acted professionally); he then ordered the wounded to be treated and the enemy dead to be covered. Kroon's superior officers later commended his leadership and ability to correct a battle-hardened group of commandoes.
These actions and his general behaviour as a leader were the reason both his subordinates and his superiors nominated Kroon for bestowal of the Military Order. The Ministry of Defence, after three years' research, recommended to Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands that Kroon be awarded the Military William Order for bravery shown during commando actions in Uruzgan. Queen Beatrix made Kroon a Knight (fourth class) of the Military William Order on 29 May 2009: the first time in 54 years that the honour had been given to an individual.
Criminal investigation and conviction.
In January 2010, Kroon and his girlfriend (aged 34) were named in a drugs case in The Netherlands. According to publications he was suspected of possession of drugs and of violating the gun law. A police investigation, which was sustained after two interrogations, was said to be focusing on the café named "café Vinny's" that he was running in the town of Den Bosch. The patrons were suspected of using cocaine in the café. The "Koninklijke Marechaussee" (Dutch military police) and the Public Prosecutor confirmed the suspicion. The investigations in the case started in October 2009 and in December 2009, four other suspects had been arrested.
Kroon and his lawyer Geert-Jan Knoops denied all accusations and announced their own investigation. According to Kroon, he is the victim of defamation. He points out that he received several anonymous mails with threats, one of them saying: "From hero to zero".
According to two sources, the Dutch Ministry of Defense was aware of the alleged reputation of Kroon's pub before he received his award for bravery in Afghanistan. The source of the accusations was believed to be an unmentioned police informer.
The publications on the suspicion of Kroon not only led to comments on the legitimacy of his award and speculations as to his professional position, but also to criticism directed at the mentioning of his full name by the press, which is uncommon in The Netherlands in crime reporting as it is considered to be an infringement of a suspect's personal privacy, related to the presumption of innocence.
In March 2010, Kroon's lawyer told a Dutch television programme that Kroon actually wanted his bar to be drugs-free and that he had thrown customers out who did not respect this policy.
On 20 September 2010, the Office of the Attorney General officially announced that Kroon would be prosecuted and was suspected of 'possession and provision of some (in the Netherlands illegal) electroshock weapons and possession of small quantities of hard drugs for personal use'.
The trial was held before the military panel of the Arnhem court, which consists of two professional judges of the Arnhem court of which one presides the panel, and one general officer who does not belong to the judiciary. It started on 29 November 2010. Court hearings were held on 4, 5, 11 and 12 April 2011 in Arnhem. The verdict of the military panel of the Arnhem court was on 22 April 2011. Kroon was sentenced a EUR 750 fine and a conditional 80 hours of community service for possession and provision of electroshock weapons. Kroon was acquitted on the drugs related charges. Kroon will not be dismissed from the military (this would be the case if he had been convicted for using hard drugs; the Dutch Ministry of Defence has a strict no-drugs policy). Furthermore, Kroon will keep his knighthood; revocation only occurs if sentenced to prison for more than one year. The Dutch Ministry of Defense reported that it perused the verdict and will wait out the period in which the Office of the Attorney General or Kroon can appeal the verdict. Kroon announced that he would voluntarily resign his knighthood if he was convicted for drugs related charges by the appellate court. On 2 May 2011 the Office of the Attorney General refrained to seek an appeal. Immediately after the legal procedure ending the Dutch Ministry of Defence announced they will consult Kroon in the near future regarding his career wishes and possibilities. Such consultations and consequent posting changes are normal procedure for all Dutch military personnel. According to his lawyer, Kroon aspires a new military mission, this after his current administrative posting.
Continued legal action.
On 13 July 2012, Geert-Jan Knoops (Kroons lawyer) announced that Kroon will seek compensatory damages from the Dutch government after being prosecuted by the attorney-general of the Netherlands for possession of drugs. Knoops indicated that Kroon primarily wants an apology from the AG Office and that he had been negotiating with them for a year over this, but that a voluntary apology was not forthcoming. In lieu of this apology, Kroon has instructed Knoops to file a suit for unjust prosecution and is seeking compensatory damages for damage done to his reputation as well as for the loss of his cafe (which Kroon claims he hads to sell at a loss because the public trial drove customers away).

Untouchable (Girls Aloud song)

"Untouchable" is a song performed by British all-female pop group Girls Aloud, taken from their fifth studio album "Out of Control" (2008). The song was written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. Influenced by trance music and Balearic beat, the album version of "Untouchable" is over six minutes long. Remixed for single release in April 2009, "Untouchable" memorably became Girls Aloud's first single to miss the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. The song received generally favorable reviews from most contemporary music critics, who praised its ambition. "Untouchable" would be the final release by the group until Something New (2012), following their announcement of their split in 2013.
In the music video, inspired by Stanley Kubrick's "", the group travels through space and approaches Earth in illuminated glass spheres (resembling meteorites). "Untouchable" was promoted through an appearance on "Dancing on Ice" and the group's Out of Control Tour, during which the song was performed.
Background and composition.
"Untouchable" is a trance-inspired "rave ballad," which marries "Balearic guitar lines with a pulsating techno throb." The song is Girls Aloud's longest yet, at a full runtime of 6:45. "Untouchable" follows the common verse-chorus form, but includes a number of instrumental solos. Nadine Coyle sings a middle 8 ("Without any meaning, we're just skin and bone...") as the music drops out. The song builds back up and concludes with a final chorus.
Sarah Harding described the song as "so Nineties, a proper pop dance song. It’s got that trancy, chilled Ibiza feel. [...] I get lost in the music at the beginning and then it builds and builds and builds. You just want to go mental." The "emotional twangy guitar noise" heard in the song was the result of Xenomania musician Jason Resch responding to Higgins' request for something "special". Higgins left the song at its full length, knowing that "The Promise" and "The Loving Kind" would be the first two singles and he could remix "Untouchable" for single release at a later point. The song was "chopped and changed for its single release", with Girls Aloud's vocals being vocodered.
Release.
"Untouchable" was selected as the third single from "Out of Control" after it fared best in a fan poll on Girls Aloud's official forum. It was announced as the single on 20 February 2009. "Untouchable" was released on CD single and 7" vinyl formats on April 27, while digital download formats were available a day earlier. The CD includes a previously unreleased b-side entitled "It's Your Dynamite", which Digital Spy says "matches the standard set on their previous releases [...] a treat for the ears." The 7" vinyl picture disc format includes the Thriller Jill Mix of "Love Is the Key", as heard on "The Girls Aloud Party" opening credits and commercials.
Reception.
Critical response.
"Untouchable" received generally favourable reviews from music critics. Slant Magazine said that it was "one of Girls Aloud's finest achievements." John Earls of Planet Sound labelled the song "the standout track from "Out Of Control"", drawing comparisons with both DJ Sasha and the rave music of the 1990s. It was praised by "NME", described as "post-Ibiza power-balladeering". The song was referred to as "fast, electronic and fantastic" with an immense build-up to the chorus by Popjustice. BBC Music felt "the Balearic bliss of epic seven minute marathon Untouchable [...] prove that you don't have to be brassy to be brilliant." Digital Spy said the song "serves as the centrepiece" on the album and that even the radio edit "remains surprising, thrilling and strangely moving - in short, classic Girls Aloud."
However, MSN said "the plodding disco track falls short". CBBC declared, it "seems to want to be a ballad and a dance track without doing either well." GayNZ.com stated that the song "works...but possibly not as well as the girls were hoping."
Chart performance.
The song entered the UK Singles Chart on 29 March 2009 at number 54. It entered the top forty three weeks later. "The Sun" reported that "Untouchable" was in danger of becoming the first Girls Aloud single to peak outside of the top ten, ending their six-year streak of twenty consecutive top ten singles. On 3 May 2009, it officially reached number eleven. On the Irish Singles Chart, the song entered at number 38 and peaked at number nineteen.
After the single failed to achieve top ten success when it was released late April 2009, a fan-created Facebook campaign was started nearly a year later (January 2010). The group hoped to push the single into the top ten, reviving and continuing Girls Aloud's streak. The campaign failed, with "Untouchable" only charting at number 152.
Music video.
The music video for "Untouchable" was directed by Marco Puig with post-production from The Mill. Shot in a west London studio on 18 March 2009, the filming took sixteen hours. Pictures of Girls Aloud in their "skimpy rubber" outfits for the music video were published in tabloid newspapers on 25 March 2009. The video premiered on 25 March 2009 on 4music at 7:00pm GMT and was shown again at 11:05pm on Channel 4. The "Untouchable" video was made available on MSN the following day.
The futuristic video was inspired by Stanley Kubrick's classic science fiction film "". Girls Aloud appear in "sci-fi inspired PVC leotards", travelling through space and approaching Earth in illuminated glass spheres (resembling meteorites). After the second verse, the words 'Alert: Condition Red' appear on the screen and the girls have trouble in their bubble-like orbs. They begin to plummet through Earth's atmosphere, with the spheres erupting in flames. Still burning, they pass an aeroplane and approach a city. The video ends with televisions showing the 'breaking news' as they hit the ground, with a reporter describing it as a "meteor shower" before turning to static.
Digital Spy lauded the "Untouchable" music video as "almost as exciting as the song itself."
Live performances.
The first performance of the song occurred at the "Dancing on Ice" semi-finals. Girls Aloud entered on wires suspended from the ceiling and performed the song whilst ice dancers Torvill and Dean skated around them. Girls Aloud wore draped Grecian dresses. Smoke followed the group as they were lowered down on to individual podiums. As Nadine sang the final verse, Torvill and Dean were raised into the air on wires. The song ended with an explosion of pyrotechnics. Torvill and Dean were criticised for "completely and utterly ruining the momentum and energy."
"Untouchable" was one of the most significant performances of Girls Aloud's 2009 Out of Control Tour. The song is "performed over the crowd on a flying platform," which Girls Aloud use to travel to a smaller stage in the middle of the arena. Girls Aloud wear science fiction-inspired outfits, designed by Welsh fashion designer Julien MacDonald, along with the rest of the show's costumes. The song was performed on 2013 with the girls wearing sci-fi clothes under UV lights.

Legislative Council of Nova Scotia

The Legislative Council of Nova Scotia was the upper house of the legislature of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. It existed from 1838 to May 31, 1928. From the establishment of responsible government in 1848, members were appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia on the advice of the Premier.
Origins.
The Legislative Council had its origins in the older unified Nova Scotia Council, created in 1720, which exercised a combination of executive, legislative, and judicial functions. The Council acted as the Governor's cabinet, as the upper house of the provincial legislature, and as the province's General Court until the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was established in 1754. The Council generally consisted of twelve members, five of whom constituted a quorum. While appointments were technically made by the Sovereign, they were in practice made by the Board of Trade, though the Governor usually provided a list of potential nominees. Nominations were at pleasure, but were in practice treated as during good behaviour.
Following a series of conflicts with the Assembly and rising demands for responsible government in the province, the Board of Trade ordered in 1838 that the Council be split into separate Executive and Legislative Councils.
1925 reform.
With the Assembly seemingly unable to abolish the Legislative Council without its permission, it eventually came to consider reforming the Council as a next-best alternative. The first serious reform proposal was considered in 1916, when the Assembly passed a reform bill based on the imperial Parliament Act, 1911, which limited the veto of the House of Lords. The bill would have changed the Council's absolute veto to a suspensory veto; if the Assembly passed a bill in three successive legislative sessions over two years, the bill would go into effect notwithstanding the lack of the Council's consent. This bill, which was presented to the Council in the last days of the 1916 session at the height of the first World War, was received badly by the Council, which refused to pass it. A similar bill was considered by the Assembly the following year, but was dropped after the Council threatened not to pass any other bills sent to it by the Assembly.
The subject of abolition was revived in 1922, when the Assembly passed a resolution calling for the Legislative Council's resolution. Instead of sending an abolition bill to the Council, however, the Assembly formed a delegation to meet with members of the Legislative Council to consider methods of abolition. When the two delegations met together, the Assembly members were surprised that while the Councillors were unwilling to accept abolition, they were quite interested in potential reforms designed to make the Legislature work more effectively, including the possibility of electing the Council. As it was once again late in the legislative session, there was not sufficient time to negotiate a specific proposal, however. As such, the delegations requested permission from the Assembly and Council to continue working on the matter until the 1923 session. When the Legislature met again in 1923, the joint committee met again, but discussions once more led nowhere, as each group expected the other to offer a specific proposal. 
During the 1924 session, the Assembly once more considered an abolition bill proposed by Howard William Corning, House Leader of the Conservative Party. After vehement debate, in which Liberal MHAs defended the Legislative Council as a bulwark against radicalism, the bill was defeated in the Assembly.
The following year, Premier Armstrong introduced a bill to reform the Legislative Council in three respects: first, it implemented the Parliament Act, 1911, in Nova Scotia; second, it limited the tenure of office of new appointees to the Council to ten years, although Councillors would be eligible for reappointment; and third, it imposed an age limit of seventy for new members and seventy-five for existing members. After criticism from the Halifax Morning Chronicle, the bill was amended to drop the eligibility for reappointment. The amended bill passed the Assembly on a party line vote, and was sent to the Council, which further amended it to remove the age limit for sitting Councillors, increase the age limit for new appointees to seventy-five, and prohibit use of the new procedure to abolish the Council without its consent.
As the reform bill was passed barely a month before an election in which the Liberals were expected to do poorly, it was immediately criticized by Conservatives as a ploy to extend Liberal rule beyond the grave. When the Conservatives won a resounding victory, they almost immediately reopened plans to abolish the Legislative Council.
Abolition.
Following the Conservative landslide in 1925, the Council abolition debate was reopened. The Conservatives' first Speech from the Throne in 1926 called for the abolition of the Council; a few weeks later, Rhodes introduced an abolition bill in the Assembly. Meanwhile, Rhodes worked behind the scenes to try to negotiate for the Council to agree to abolish itself. In February, Rhodes offered the pre-reform Councillors pensions of $1000 per annum for ten years, and the post-reform Councillors $500 per annum for ten years; this proposal was rejected almost unanimously by the Council as a "bribe", and inspired the Council to pass a resolution affirming its important constitutional role.
With the Council seemingly unwilling to abolish itself, Rhodes considered alternative means of achieving abolition. In early March, he settled on a scheme to appoint twenty Councillors in addition to the eighteen already sitting in the Council. As the Council was presumed to be limited to twenty-one, this would have resulted in seventeen Councillors over and above the presumed constitutional limit. Wary of the constitutionality of the appointments, Lieutenant-Governor James Cranswick Tory wrote of the plan to Secretary of State in Ottawa, stating that he planned to make the appointments on March 15, 1926, unless instructed otherwise by the Governor General. After receiving an opinion from the Law Officers expressing the belief that the appointments in excess of twenty-one would be unconstitutional, the Governor General instructed Lieutenant-Governor Tory not to make the appointments for the time being, and suggested that the matter should be judicially considered.
Rebuffed by Ottawa, the Rhodes government then filed a reference for an advisory opinion with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The reference presented four questions:
In October 1926, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court issued a divided opinion in which two judges ruled that the Lieutenant-Governor could appoint more than twenty-one Councillors, and two ruled that he could not. While three of the four judges ruled that the Councillor's tenure of office was at pleasure, only two ruled that it was at the pleasure of the Lieutenant-Governor; the third judge ruled that they served at the pleasure of His Majesty the King. (The fourth judge ruled that Councillors served for life.) With the court effectively evenly divided on all issues, there was no majority decision, and so Rhodes would have to wait for an appellate verdict before he could abolish the Legislative Council. 
In October 1927, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled that the Lieutenant-Governor could appoint so many Councillors as he desired and that Councillors served at his pleasure. After fifty years, abolition would finally be possible.
In the weeks before the 1928 legislative session, Rhodes dismissed all but one of the Liberal Councillors appointed before 1925 and appointed enough new Conservative members to reach the symbolic number of twenty-two (to emphasize the Lieutenant-Governor's constitutional right to increase the size of the Council). On February 24, 1928, the now Conservative-dominated Council passed an abolition bill sent to it days before by the Assembly. Under the terms of the bill, the Council would be abolished as of May 31, 1928, so as to avoid any constitutional problems with legislation passed during the 1928 session.

Walter Lingo

Walter Lingo (1891–1966) was an Airedale Terrier breeder from La Rue, Ohio. During the 1920s, he owned the Oorang Dog Kennels. As a way of promoting his kennels, Lingo financed a National Football League franchise, called the Oorang Indians in 1922.
Dog breeder.
Lingo bred his first litter when he was 9 years old in 1900. Over time he bred and sought to create a stronger type of Airedale. His efforts resulted in the King Oorang breed of Airedale dogs. Lingo described the King Oorang as the "world's great all-around dog." Upon creating the King Oorang breed, Lingo embarked on a mail order business, selling his puppies to people throughout the Americas. Lingo spent most of his time breeding and training his championship Oorang Airedale dogs in LaRue. He expanded his breeding program expanded to meet the enormous demand for Airedales by selling up to a thousand Airedale bitches to farmers throughout Ohio. Lingo took back the bitches for breeding and whelping, then returned them to their owners, while buying back the pups at a pre-agreed price. Lingo then resold the pups to buyers throughout the country. Reportedly Walter sold up to 15,000 Airedales per year, and by the mid-1920s he claimed to be spending $2000 per month on advertising.
Over time, the Oorang Kennel Company and its Oorang Airedales became known throughout the world. He donated a stud dog for Red Cross work in Europe to the military during World War I, then, after the war, promoted in advertising for the purpose of breeding. He also gave away dogs as a promotion to winners of contests, silent film stars, baseball players, and two were given to the editor of "Field & Stream" magazine, who favored the kennel with complimentary ads and even a fictional book or two, featuring Oorang Airedales.
However many of Lingo's neighbors described the Airedales as killers. These neighboring farmers accused the Oorang Kennels of raising a nation of sheep killers. This public relations disaster, prompted Lingo to enlist the aid of celebrities to endorse his dogs. He invited celebrities, such as Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers, boxer Jack Dempsey, actor Gary Cooper, Tris Speaker of the Cleveland Indians, and Olympic sprinter Charles Paddock to LaRue to hunt with him and his dogs. Perhaps, Lingo's most famous supporter was Jim Thorpe, the celebrated athlete of the 1920s. With no reluctance at all, Thorpe came to Lingo's aid by testifying that he once knew an Oorang Airedale that had saved a 6-year-old girl's life. After that, Lingo and Thorpe became hunting buddies.
Oorang Indians.
To help promote his dogs, Lingo eventually created the Oorang Indians, an NFL team in La Rue. He established the squad as a publicity stunt and named the team after his Oorang dog kennels. The cost of establishing an NFL franchise in 1922 was $100, however the cost of just one of Lingo's Airedales could sell for $150. The stunt worked and Lingo would go on to make a million dollars selling Airedales in just one year, during the height of popularity of the Oorang Indians. Interestingly, La Rue, is the smallest community to have ever sponsored an NFL franchise. The Indians, however, never played a game in La Rue. the team was primarily a traveling team. What "home games" they did play were played in Marion since La Rue lacked a playing field.
Lingo hired Thorpe to put together a team that only consisted of Native American players. He was paid $500 a week to organize the team. The Indians remained a team in the National Football League for the 1922 and the 1923 seasons. The Oorang Indians players not only played football. Lingo also required them to work in his kennels, caring for his dogs. He also forced his players to parade around the football field with his dogs during half times, hoping that fans would purchase his dogs. Lingo used his own Airedale terrier magazine, "Oorang Comments," to get dog and football enthusiasts buzzing about his product and his team. At first the Oorang Indians were an excellent gate attraction. However, the novelty eventually wore off and Lingo pulled his financial backing. So, at the end of the 1923 NFL season, the Indians, suspended operations.
First halftime shows.
Many football historians credit Lingo with creating the halftime show. He would lure audiences to his games with the promise of an outrageous halftime show, instead of the promise of a good football game. Entertainment, both prior to the games and during halftimes, was provided by the players and the Airedale dogs. There were shooting exhibitions with the dogs retrieving the targets. There were Indian dances and tomahawk and knife-throwing demonstrations. One halftime event was showcased an Indians player, named Long Time Sleep, wrestled a live bear. Another show was a demonstration of the United States Indian scouts actions during World War I. The show promoted Lingo's kennels by showing the Airedale Red Cross dogs administering first aid to wound soldier. Many of the scouts and Red Cross dogs taking part in the event were real veterans of the war, while the German troops were impersonated by local American Legion men who wore German uniforms furnished by Lingo. The halftime activities soon became more important than the results of the game for the Indians fanbase. The Indians only won 3 games in their two seasons of existence.
Great Depression.
After the Oorang Indians' collapse, Lingo continued to sell his Airedale dogs. Unfortunately, the Great Depression struck in the 1930s, prompting Lingo to scale back his business. People could no longer afford the Airedales, prompting Lingo to have approximately three hundred puppies put to sleep in 1929 alone. He eventually tried to establish a business in Minneapolis, Minnesota that manufactured dog biscuits, but this venture failed to succeed. However back in LaRue, Lingo's wife, Beryl, revived the kennels. Although the operation was scaled down from its 1920's peak, the Oorang Kennel Company continued until Walter Lingo’s death in 1966.

The Doomsday Prophets

The Doomsday Prophets (Swedish: "Domedagsprofeterna") is an opera by Wilhelm Peterson-Berger, to his own Swedish libretto, composed from 1912–17. It was first performed at the Royal Opera, Stockholm on 21 February 1919.
Background.
Based on a story which the composer found in the journal "Den svenska Mercurius" (1759), the opera features several historical characters (Bure, Skytte, Queen Kristina), and is set in the university city of Uppsala just before the end of the Thirty Years’ War in which Sweden became a major European power. The war increased people’s worries about the end of the world and two academics claim to have calculated when Doomsday will take place. The opera’s composition was completed during the First World War.The first performance was conducted by Armas Järnefelt. 
Synopsis.
The Muggen Inn in Uppsala on 27 May 1647. Due to a wager between the university don Johan Bure and Queen Kristina’s apothecary Simon Wolimhaus, as to when the world will end (which the professor seems to be fated to lose), the innkeeper, Klas Mugg, and his daughter, Elin, look set to lose their home. Elin is in love with the studious but poor Lars, who is bullied by the ‘nobler’ students. (Lars’s aunt is also trying to match him with her own daughter.) Lars gets arrested for threatening his tormentors with Johan Papegoja’s pistol and is arraigned in front of a university tribunal, which could result in him being expelled. 
Outside Uppsala cathedral.
With Lars afraid for his future and marriage to Elin, army captain Lennart Sporre convinces Klas to let Elin marry Lars, in return for upsetting the wager, which he does by setting fire to Wolimhaus’ dog kennel (this invalidates the terms of the wager as the fire devalues the latter’s effects) under cover of a thunderstorm. He argues with the university officials that passing judgment on Lars when the end of the world is nigh is pointless. They ignore this and proceed to condemn Lars, but when the fire is discovered, he escapes during the tumult.
On Uppsala Castle Hill. Lars is now in despair, wondering whether he should enlist in the army or emigrate. Sporre and the noble students sing a serenade to Görvel and city musicians assemble in the castle tower to welcome the queen. Sporre explains that the wager is no longer valid as the value of the properties has changed because of the fire (as he planned). As the brass blare out, Wolimhaus believes the Doomsday has arrived, but it is the Queen’s arrival and acclaim from the crowd. Lars is pardoned, is able to marry Elin and Sporre gets his beloved Görvel. The two prophets are left confounded.

USCHLA

The Uschla ("Untersuchung und Schlichtungs-Ausschuss", roughly translated as the "Committee for Investigation and Settlement") was an internal Nazi tribunal system that was established by Adolf Hitler in 1926 to settle intra-party problems and disputes.
Organization.
The Uschla eventually evolved into a four-level system, organized on geographic lines. 
The highest level, the "Reichs-Uschla", presided in Munich, where the NSDAP (the Nazi Party) itself had begun. 
Immediately below this level was the "Gau-Uschla", with one such tribunal for each Gau. Following the general geographic organization of the Gau system, below this Gau-level was the "Kreis-Uschla", which in turn linked to the lowest level of tribunal, the "Ort-Uschla". At the zenith of the system's development, a typical Gau might contain approximately 100 Ort-Uschlas. "Grant", p. 57-8.
The initial chairman of the Uschla was a former Reichswehr Lieutenant General Heinemann, who failed to grasp the real purpose of the tribunal: namely, to settle disputes so as to keep them quiet, rather than to achieve substantive justice between the disputants or to enforce a moral code. 
Accordingly, he was soon replaced in 1927 by the politically more astute Major Walter Buch (also a former Reichswehr officer), who was in turn aided by two close and highly trusted Hitler cohorts, Ulrich Graf and Hans Frank. 
Buch remained as the chair of the Uschla until the end of World War II.
Conflicts between the Sturmabteilung (SA) and the Uschla system were perhaps inevitable, reflecting in part the typical conflict between political and military functions in less pathological institutions. The SA leadership sought maximum autonomy within the Nazi system, and resented any infringement upon its free-wheeling style, especially if based (even theoretically) upon some principles of law. The natural antagonism between the two loci of power peaked when the Uschla attempted to subject SA men to its jurisdiction.
A particular case in January 1930 defined the jurisdictional issue between the rivals. After a hearing before an Ort-Uschla in Saxony, expulsion was ordered for an SA man, but his SA commander disagreed with the decision and claimed that the tribunal had no jurisdiction over SA men performing their functions in the line of duty. A rather feeble SA attempt at compromise in May 1930 stipulated that the Uschla lacked jurisdiction over "SA affairs" and could only intervene in those affairs if (a) the SA man's conduct did serious harm to the interests of the NSDAP and (b) his commanding officer agreed that serious harm had been done. While this bit of Nazi lawyering appeared to make Uschla jurisdiction, in effect, entirely contingent upon the consent of the SA commander, it left the undefined term "SA affairs" open to interpretation and argument, so little progress in settling the jurisdictional squabble resulted.
Upon assuming control of the SA in January 1931, Ernst Röhm attempted a conciliation with Buch over SA-Uschla affairs. However, these conciliatory attempts crashed upon the rock of the Stennes Revolt.

Eugene Michael Jones (born May 4, 1948) is a writer, former professor, media commentator and the current editor of "Culture Wars" magazine (formerly "Fidelity Magazine").
Early career.
He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and raised in the Roman Catholic Church, but lost interest in it in early adulthood. He became involved in the counterculture of the 1960s. He found little satisfaction after leaving his faith, and eventually returned to it after reading "The Seven Storey Mountain" by Thomas Merton. Jones then obtained his Ph.D. from Temple University and began to teach at Saint Mary's College, of Notre Dame, Indiana. To Jones' displeasure, he found this college to be what he considered to be (in the words of Michael W. Cuneo who interviewed him) "the antithesis of what a Catholic college should be", being pro-choice, feminist and secular. He made little effort to conceal his views, leading to conflicts with many faculty, his department chairwoman and eventually the college's president. His department, which viewed him as a religious absolutist, decided against renewing his contract after his first year.
Writings.
Jones's work has primarily been concerned with the relationship between the Catholic Church and secular culture as well as the sexual revolution and the wider cultural effects of the second Vatican council. Later work has focused on the historical friction between the Catholic Church and Jews.
Jones denounces antisemitism, saying that any form of racism is against his Catholic faith. He has stated publicly that he considers modern Judaism to be a wicked ideology, but that he condemns criticism of Jews based upon race. In February, 2008, due to a complaint of antisemitism from the Southern Poverty Law Center, the School of Architecture at The Catholic University of America cancelled a lecture series in which Jones was scheduled to speak. In an interview with "The Washington Times" Jones said that he rejected racism in all of its forms, consistent with Catholic teaching and responded to the cancellation in an article in "Culture Wars".
Current work.
In recent years Jones has focused on and written numerous articles examining usury and wider economic issues.
He has just finished a book to be entitled Barren Metal: Capitalism as State-Sponsored Usury.
Media appearances.
Jones has made numerous appearances as a journalistic commentator on Russia Today and PressTV.

Hazard (2005 film)

Hazard is 2005 Japanese film mostly shot in New York, written and directed by Sono Sion, starring Joe Odagiri and Jai West. It is the story of three youths who attempt to avenge their rights in a society of criminals and thugs.
Synopsis.
Shin (Jo Odagiri), a Japanese university student, finds a book with a section about the hazards to be found in New York City. Otherwise leading a boring life, he eagerly heads to New York but soon finds out the hazzards are true when he is mugged. Two Japanese-American punks, Lee (Jai West), an outgoing thief his shy sidekick Takeda (Motoki Fukami), help him out after the mugging, and together the three begin a life of excitement and danger. In the end, that gets them in trouble with the police, resulting in a death. Shin ultimately goes back to Japan with a new thirst for life.
Reception.
Critical reception for the film was mixed to positive. "Twitch Film" praised the film, writing that director Sono's "grunge fantasy of New York is built up from impressions of the city through early Scorsese pictures makes no bones of its wish-fulfillment intent." They made note of the film being shot "with long hand-held takes and an improvised feel of perpetual motion," and making use of non-actors in supporting roles to give the film a sense of vérité style "cleverly subverted to full blown fantasy." "Asia Pacific Arts" called "Hazard" a "gritty, bilingual (even bipolar) film". "Film Threat" also praised the film, writing that even with director Sono not liking the film and with his feeling it was the least of his works, the reviewer felt the film was a "brilliant" and "extremely well made romp through the criminal NYC underworld."
However, "Japan Times" overall panned the film, saying that the movie "trades on tired cliches of American (or rather pre-Guiliani New York) criminality and racism, while betraying attitudes close to those it is ostensibly condemning".
Release.
The film was shot guerilla style in New York City in 2002, but did not have theatrical release in Japan until 2006. The film debuted at the Sapporo Film Festival on November 5, 2005, and had theatrical release in Japan on November 11, 2006, and in South Korea on April 19, 2007. It screened at the Fantasia Film Festival in Canada on July 9, 2007 and at the Lyon Asiexpo Film Festival in France on November 9, 2007. Its most recent festival screening was at the Torino Film Festival in Italy on November 27, 2011.
DVD.
The DVD features Japanese and English dialogue with optional English and French subtitles. DVD extras include a "making-of" (in Japanese only), a video interview with the director, and a booklet containing a written interview in English.

Tymion

Tymion was an ancient town in Phrygia, Asia Minor (in today's Turkish district of Karahallı, Uşak Province, Aegean Region). Its site is located at the Turkish village of Şükranje. 
From the middle of the 2nd century CE to the middle of the 6th century CE, Tymion was an important town for the ancient Christian church of Montanism. The Montanists, whose church spread all over the Roman Empire, expected the New Jerusalem to descend to earth at Tymion and the nearby town of Pepuza; Pepuza was the headquarters of Montanism and the seat of the Montanist patriarch. One of the founders of Montanism, Montanus, called both towns "Jerusalem." In late antiquity, both places attracted crowds of pilgrims from all over the Roman Empire. Women played an emancipated role in Montanism. They could become priests and also bishops. In the 6th century CE, this church became extinct.
Since 2001, Peter Lampe of the University of Heidelberg has directed annual archaeological campaigns in Phrygia, Turkey. During these interdisciplinary campaigns, together with William Tabbernee of Tulsa, numerous unknown ancient settlements were discovered and archaeologically documented. Two of them are the best candidates so far in the search for the identification of the two holy centers of ancient Montanism, Pepuza and Tymion. Scholars had searched for these lost sites since the 19th century.
The archaeological site at Şükranje (Karahallı area) that Peter Lampe identified as Tymion was already settled in late Bronze and early Iron Ages. It flourished in Roman and Byzantine times as a rural town where predominantly tenant farmers lived. They worked on an imperial estate and were often oppressed by travelling magistrates or imperial slaves. In a petition, the farmers asked for help from the emperor. The emperor Septimius Severus wrote back that his procurator would support the farmers. The imperial rescript is preserved on an inscription.

Toutswemogala Hill

Toutswemogala Hill lies 6.5 km West of the North-South Highway in the Central District of Botswana. It is situated about 50 km north of the village of Palapye. Toutswemogala is an elongated flat-topped hill rising about 50 meters above the surrounding flat mopane veld. It is an Iron Age settlement, which has been occupied on two different occasions. The radio-carbon dates for this settlement range from 7th to late 19th century AD indicating occupation of more than one thousand years. The hill was part of the formation of early states in Southern Africa with cattle keeping as major source of economy. This was supplemented by goats, sheep and foraging as well as hunting of wild animals. The remaining features of Toutswe settlement include house-floors, large heaps of vitrified cow-dog and burials while the outstanding structure is the stone wall. There are large traits of centaurs ciliaris, a type of grass which has come to be associated with cattle-keeping settlements in South, Central Africa.
History.
Around 700 A.D., the Toutswe people moved westward into Botswana and began an agricultural and pastoral land tenure system based on sorghum and millet, and domesticated stock, respectively. The site was situated in the center of a broader cultural area in Eastern Botswana and shares many commonalities with other archaeological sites of this region, in both ceramic production styles and also timeframes inhabited. Large structures were observed that contained vitrified remains of animal dung, leading to the theory that these were animal enclosures and that Toutswemogala Hill was thus a major center of animal husbandry in the region. However, agriculture also played a vital role in the longevity of Toutswemogala Hill's extended occupation, as many grain storage structures have also been found on the site. Many different stratified layers of housing floors further signal continuous occupation over hundreds of years.
World Heritage Status.
This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on July 21st, 1999 in the Cultural category.

No. 644 Squadron RAF

No. 644 Squadron RAF was a unit in 38 Group of the Royal Air Force during World War II which undertook glider-towing and supply dropping missions as well being employed in the paratroop role.
History.
Formation and World War II.
When the build up for Operation Overlord got under way, an increasing need for transport and airborne assault squadrons became apparent. Therefore personnel and aircraft from No. 298 Squadron RAF at RAF Tarrant Rushton were formed into No. 644 Squadron on 23 February 1944 as part of No. 38 Group RAF. Operations also included supply dropping to SOE forces and glider towing during the operations Overlord, Market Garden and Varsity. They also carried out supply drops over Norway and even some tactical night-bombing missions towards the end of the war.
Post war.
Following the end of hostilities in Europe, 644 Squadron helped to transport the 1st Parachute Brigade to Copenhagen on the 8th May, where they were to oversee the surrender and disarmament of the German forces in Denmark. On the following day they carried the remainder of the 1st Airborne Division to Norway for similar duties. Ever since the Normandy invasion, No. 46 Group RAF had been involved in a "shuttle service" of ferrying freight to the front line and removing either wounded or freed prisoners of war to Britain. Although most of the armies were more or less static now that the War was over, RAF Transport Command's responsibilities increased, and so No. 38 Group RAF received orders to assist in this capacity. In addition to the transport of freight and prisoners of war, No. 644 Squadron also flew service personnel to Greece, North Africa and Italy. In July, the Squadron lost a Halifax over the Pyrenees. 
In November 1945, the 6th Airborne Division was despatched to Palestine to help police the worsening political crisis that was developing in the region, and 644 Squadron were ordered to lend them their support and so accompanied them to RAF Qastina in Palestine (now Hatzor Airbase). On 1 September 1946 No. 644 squadron disbanded by being re-numbered to No. 47 Squadron RAF.
Present.
The squadron today is represented by No. 644 Volunteer Gliding Squadron, which has the same squadron crest though with a different motto.

Tony Costa

Antone Charles "Tony" Costa (August 2, 1944 – May 12, 1974) was a Cape Cod, Massachusetts carpenter who achieved notoriety for committing serial murders in and around the town of Truro in 1969.
1969 murders.
The case gained international attention when district attorney Edmund Dinis, in comments to the media, claimed "The hearts of each girl had been removed from the bodies and were not in the graves…Each body was cut into as many parts as there are joints." Dinis also claimed that there were teeth marks found on the bodies. These claims produced a stream of national and international media outlets into local Provincetown, Massachusetts. The media attention was so great that Kurt Vonnegut (whose daughter Edith had met Costa) compared him to Jack the Ripper in his collection of essays "Wampeters, Foma and Granfalloons".
Costa was suspected of killing seven women: Bonnie Williams, Diane Federoff, Barbara Spaulding, Sydney Monson, Susan Perry, Patricia Walsh, and Mary Anne Wysocki but convicted of killing only two: Walsh and Wysocki. On February 8, 1969, while looking for the bodies of Patricia Walsh and Mary Anne Wysocki, police discovered Susan Perry. Perry had been missing since the previous Labor Day.
Perry's body had been cut into eight pieces. When Wysocki's body was found about a month later, her torso and head had been buried separately. Not long after, Walsh and the rest of Wysocki's bodies were found in a forest clearing that Costa had used for growing marijuana. This "garden" of marijuana plants and the greater case inspired the true crime book "In His Garden", by Leo Damore.
Costa's account.
Costa described the murders of Walsh and Wysocki in his unpublished novel, "Resurrection", written while Costa was in prison. In his account, Costa and a friend named "Carl" were out with the two women consuming LSD and Dilaudid. Carl then shot Walsh and Wysocki. Costa claimed he was able to subdue his friend, and upon realizing that Mary Anne Wysocki was still alive, Costa used a knife to end her suffering. According to Costa, he and Carl buried the bodies.
The novel also describes the deaths of Susan Perry and Sydney Monzon as due to drug overdoses. Costa claims it was Carl who dismembered and buried their bodies and that he had no knowledge until after their deaths.
Trial and imprisonment.
On June 12, 1969, Costa was arraigned on charges of murder for three of the deaths. In May 1970 he was convicted of the murders of Mary Ann Wysocki and Patricia Walsh and sentenced to life in prison at Massachusetts' Walpole Correctional Institution. Four years after his incarceration, Costa committed suicide by hanging himself in his cell.

Bharat Forge Co Ltd v Uttam Manohar Nakate [http://www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/2005/45.html INSC 45 is an Indian labour law case concerning the dismissal of a worker who was found to be asleep in 1983. After 22 years, the Supreme Court of India upheld his dismissal.
Facts.
Uttam was a helper in Bharat Forge. He was found lying fast asleep on an iron plate in the corner of the department at 11:40 a.m. on 26 August 1983. This was the fourth time this had happened, After five-month-long disciplinary hearings, the company fired him in January 1984. Uttam went to court, which found the company guilty of "unfair trade practice" and forced the factory to take Uttam back and pay him 50 percent of his lost wages. The case was appealed to the Bombay High Court and eventually to the national Supreme Court of India, reported as AIR 2005 SC 947.
Judgment.
In 2005 the Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the company had the right to fire him.
Significance.
Nakate's case is often used as an example of the problems with Indian labour law system of requiring government approval before dismissals can take effect.

Cecil Commerce Center

Cecil Commerce Center (CCC) is a commercial and industrial center in Jacksonville, Florida. It is located on Jacksonville's Westside on the former Naval Air Station Cecil Field, and includes Cecil Airport. The 17 thousand-acre center represents more than three percent of the land area in Duval County, most of it zoned for development. The property was conveyed to the City of Jacksonville and converted to its current use between 1999 and 2002.
History.
In July 1993, former Naval Air Station Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida was recommended for closure by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. In response to the decision to close NAS Cecil Field, the Mayor of Jacksonville established the Cecil Field Development Commission, succeeded by the Jacksonville Economic Development Commission (JEDC), and later the Office of Economic Development (OED). One of the major responsibilities of the commission was to develop a proposed base reuse plan that would guide the transition of NAS Cecil Field from a fully operational Navy base to civilian use.
In 1996, the NAS Cecil Field Final Base Reuse Plan was approved and in March 1999, the Jacksonville City Council approved the Cecil Commerce Center Operations and Business Plan.
The plan projected that businesses at the CCC would have 5,600 employees by 2009 and 25,000 by 2019. Between July 1999 and April 2002, property was conveyed to the JEDC (now the OED), Jacksonville Aviation Authority (JAA), the City of Jacksonville Parks Department and Clay County.
Existing recreational facilities within the area were included with surrounding acreage to create the Cecil Recreation Complex, which was expanded to create the Jacksonville Equestrian Center, Cecil Aquatic Center, and other new recreation opportunities. 
Since the time of the conveyance of approximately , the OED has worked to promote the site as a prime location for companies in the manufacturing, industrial-related and distribution industries, as well as other uses including support retail and office space along the main roads.
The Jacksonville Aviation Authority controls the land surrounding the airport and south of Normandy Boulevard. Several aviation companies have leased all the former Navy hangars at the airport. Most of this area was developed by the Navy before the base was closed. Land to the north of Normandy Boulevard is controlled by the city of Jacksonville, and is mostly wetlands. Many sites require four feet of fill, establishing drainage and building a road to the parcel from New World Avenue, the main thoroughfare connecting Normandy with Cecil Commerce Center Parkway. There is also no railroad service at CCC, so if a business needed it, the city would need to pay for a spur that crosses Interstate 10.
The biggest development goal was to attract a mega-project, such as an aircraft or vehicle assembly plant which would employ thousands. Those projects usually depend on incentives, and competition among the states of North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Florida is intense. CCC has competed for several big deals, including an aircraft manufacturing plant for Boeing, a complex for Spirit AeroSystems, and a van assembly plant for DaimlerChrysler. 
The Cecil Commerce Center Parkway and I-10 interchange was completed in October, 2009. The $62 million project provided direct access to Cecil Commerce Center and was the first section of the new, regional First Coast Expressway. In 2009, the actual number of people employed at CCC in 2009 was approximately 2,000, just one third of the projected number.
On June 8, 2010, the city signed a contract with Hillwood as Master Developer for CCC to 
expedite development, provide expertise, strategy and private capital for the long term project.
Existing Users.
Currently, there are more than 2,500 jobs generated by the various entities located at Cecil Commerce Center. A listing of these various establishments includes:

1972 Caribbean Series

The XV edition of the Caribbean Series ("Serie del Caribe") was played in . It was held from February 1 through February 6 with the champions teams from Dominican Republic (Aguilas Cibaeñas), Mexico (Algodoneros de Guasave), Puerto Rico (Leones de Ponce) and Venezuela (Tigres de Aragua). The format consisted of 12 games, each team facing the other teams twice. The games were played at Estadio Quisqueya in Santo Domingo, D.R., which boosted capacity to 14.000 seats, and the first pitch was thrown by Joaquín Balaguer, by then the President of Dominican Republic.
Summary.
Puerto Rico won the Series with a 5-1 record and was managed by Frank Verdi. The Leones de Ponce was in the middle of the pack in runs scored (33), prevailing their strong pitching. The club got a fine offensive performances from 1B and Series Most Valuable Player Carlos May, who won the batting title with a .455 batting average (10-for-22), while three of the four series home runs were belted by outfielders Don Baylor (grand slam), Tommy Cruz and Rusty Torres. The pitching staff posted a collective 1.67 ERA, including two shutouts by Gary Neibauer (one-hit) and Daryl Patterson, and received fine efforts from Gary Jones (2-0, 0.81 ERA, 11.0 innings pitched), and Jim Magnuson (1-0, 1.00 ERA). Other significant players in the roster included Sandy Alomar (2B), Bernie Carbo (OF), Pat Corrales (C), José Cruz (OF), Jackie Hernández (SS), José Ortiz (OF), Santiago Rosario (PH) and Chris Zachary (P).
Dominican Republic and Venezuela finished tied for second place with a 3-3 mark. 
The Dominican's Aguilas Cibaeñas squad was piloted by Ozzie Virgil. Other than Secundino Almonte (five-hit shutout), Gene Garber (1-1, 2.57 ERA) and Ed Acosta (1-0, 4.97), the pitching staff was inconsistent at times. Two hitters carried much of the offensive weight, RF César Cedeño (.348 BA) and LF Adrian Garrett (one home run, four RBI). The team also featured Ps Charlie Hough, Juan Jiménez and Ray Newman; C Charlie Sands; IFs Julián Javier, Winston Llenas, Ted Martínez and Frank Taveras, and OFs César Cedeño, Gene Clines and Sam Mejías. 
The Venezuelan Tigres de Aragua debuted in the tournament, being guided by manager/second baseman Rod Carew (.400 BA, .500 SLG); C Faustino Zabala (.333 BA, .476 SLG) and SS Dave Concepción (.348 BA, /435 SLG).

The Venezuelan club also featured players as Ps Aurelio Monteagudo and Pablo Torrealba; IFs Brant Alyea, César Gutiérrez and Luis Salazar, and OFs Ted Ford, Pat Kelly and César Tovar.
Mexico was represented by the Algodoneros de Guasave and finished last at 1-5. The hapless Mexicans were piloted by Vinicio (Chico) García, as the team scored the fewest runs (12) and set a series record for most consecutive shutouts (2). Thor Skogan did an excellent job, pitching a five-hit shutout in Game 2 and losing a 1-0 decision in Game 9, after allowing just one hit and one unearned run. 3B Celerino Sánchez (.333) and OF Ramón Montoya (.312) led the attack for an otherwise weak offense.

Erythema multiforme major (also known as "Erythema multiforme majus") is a form of rash with skin loss or epidermal detachment. 
The term "Erythema multiforme majus" is sometimes used to imply a bullous (blistering) presentation.
According to some sources, there are two conditions included on a spectrum of this same disease process:
In this view, EM major, SJS and TEN are considered a single condition, distinguished by degree of epidermal detachment.
However, a consensus classification separates erythema multiforme minor, erythema multiforme major, and SJS/TEN as three separate entities. See the main article Erythema Multiforme.

Impressionism (play)

Impressionism is a 2009 play by Michael Jacobs about "an international photojournalist and a New York gallery owner whose unexpected brush with intimacy leads them to realize that there is an art to repairing broken lives."
Plot.
The setting is the small art gallery of Katharine Keenan, where Thomas Buckle has been employed for the past two years. They use the gallery as a hiding place, to separate themselves from a world which has shattered them. He, by his time as a world traveling photojournalist, and she, by horribly failed relationships. Thomas brings Katharine coffee each morning, and tells her stories of its particular origin, although these stories are actually reflections of his own experiences. These lead to flashbacks of iconic moments that have led to their present state, as well as their relationship to the art that hangs in the gallery, which Katharine will not easily sell. In the end, we journey through a love story which shows Katharine and Thomas, that just like the Impressionist art on the walls, the more they step away from the canvas of their lives up to now, the more they realize that their future together might hold more depth than the past that has led them to each other.
Production history.
Directed by Jack O'Brien with original music by Bob James, the play starred Joan Allen, Jeremy Irons, André DeShields, Hadley Delany, Aaron Lazar, Margarita Levieva, Marsha Mason, and Michael T. Weiss. The Broadway premiere began previews at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on February 28, 2009. Its original official opening of March 12 was later postponed to March 24, because the producer, Bill Haber, director, Jack O'Brien, and writer, Michael Jacobs believed that, as this was the show's world premiere, more previews were necessary to gauge audience reaction to particular shifts in time and place, which were part of the story. As producer Bill Haber said, "We did not give Jack O'Brien and our extraordinary creative team and company enough time to fully prepare Michael Jacobs's new play for Broadway. Impressionism is a world premiere on Broadway, which has not been work-shopped or played out of town. We are working hard in previews and we need more time to get the show finished for the official opening." The team took the time to sculpt the play back to what the original script had called for, and the intermission, which was added in rehearsal, was eliminated.
The play met with mixed reviews by the critics. Ben Brantley of "The New York Times" was negative, calling it "undernourished" and its stars "ill-used". "Entertainment Weekly", however, gave the play a B and wrote that, "["Impressionism"] practices the art of romantic comedy with a nice mix of pathos, intellect, and wit". "The New Yorker" was enthusiastic and thought the play "is as awkward as it is sublime", noting its "brazen sweetness" and "openhearted humor".

The Starlings

Starlings were an alternative rock band from London, England, formed in 1989, acting as a vehicle for New Zealand-born singer/guitarist Chris Sheehan (born 1965, Palmerston North). The group was dissolved by Sheehan around the release of their last ep. Sheehan went on to record two LPs under the name starlings as the only member and Producer/Engineer.
History.
Chris Sheehan had been a teenage star in his native New Zealand, playing guitar in the new wave band The Dance Exponents between 1983 and the late 1980s. When the group split up he moved to Los Angeles, and guested on the debut solo album by Jane Wiedlin. He also played guitar on Curve's debut EP in 1990.
Initially a five-piece band, Sheehan sacked all original Starlings members other than drummer and fellow New Zealander Barry Blacker and recruited Northampton-born bass guitarist Matt Parkin. The band were likened to The Jesus and Mary Chain, and supported Curve on their tour of the UK and Ireland in 1991. After their first EP, the band signed to Dave Stewart's Anxious Records. The band's debut album "Valid" was released in 1992, the songs documenting Sheehan's withdrawal from heroin, followed two years later by "Too Many Dogs", with songs described as "vicious, dark, misanthropic gems", the latter released in the United States by Atlantic Records, and attracting critical acclaim if not commercial success. Contractual difficulties had led the band to split up in 1991 shortly before the recording of 'valid'. Parkin and Blacker had also acted as the rhythm section for The Jesus and Mary Chain between 1991 and 1992.
Sheehan played with Babylon Zoo, and The Mutton Birds in the latter half of the 1990s and returned with a solo album, "Planet Painkiller" in 2000, under the name Chris Starling. In 2002 the album "Sounds like... Chris Starling" was released by Popchild records. He joined The Sisters of Mercy as rhythm guitarist later that year, although he has now left the band.
In July 2013, Sheehan announced through Fundrazr that he was suffering from incurable cancer (Stage 4 metastatic nodular melanoma)

Italian general election, 2008 (Aosta Valley)

The Italian general election of 2008 took place on 13–14 April 2008.
In the Aosta Valley single-seat constituency Roberto Nicco, the incumbent deputy for the centre-left Autonomy Liberty Democracy, was narrowly re-elected, while incumbent senator Carlo Perrin (Valdostan Renewal, Autonomy Liberty Democracy) was defeated by Antonio Fosson (Valdostan Union, Aosta Valley coalition). The parliamentary delegation of Aosta Valley was thus split between the centre-left and the regionalist coalition led by Valdostan Union.

Larklight trilogy

The "Larklight" trilogy is a trilogy of young adult novels by Philip Reeve, entitled "Larklight", "Starcross", and "Mothstorm". These books are all illustrated by David Wyatt.
Setting.
The "Larklight" trilogy is set in an alternative Victorian-era universe, where mankind has been exploring the solar system for at least a century. Earth is the same as it was in the late 19th century, but only the United Kingdom and its Empire possess the engines to travel across the solar system. The United States, which the British consider to be rebellious colonies, and France, though not technically at war with Britain on Earth, are in a struggle to sabotage the Britons' expansive interests and develop space technology of their own.
London, the centre of the universe, has many spaceports and is the base of many organisations such as the Royal Xenological Society.
Larklight.
"Larklight" is the first book in the series. The story begins in the Larklight manor where they have a visitor. However soon white spiders from Saturn invade Larklight and they have to save the known universe from a madman.
Starcross.
"Starcross", the second book in the trilogy begins when Art Mumby and his prim older sister Myrtle, at their home (Larklight) with their mother and father, receive a strange invitation to the Starcross hotel, located in the asteroid field.
Mothstorm.
"Mothstorm", the third book and possibly the last book in the trilogy, was published in hardback in October 2008. The paperback was scheduled to be published on 6 July 2009. They fight giant moths, and a race of blue lizards led by a Rogue Shaper.
Film Adaptions.
Warner Bros. had planned a $200 million adaptation of the first book "Larklight", with Shekhar Kapur directing. The movie would have been released in 2010. It is unknown if the rest of the trilogy will be adapted. However Shekhar Kapur said "Larklight" will be the last expensive movie he will make, so it is unlikely that "Starcross" and "Mothstorm" will be adapted unless another director chooses to do so.
The film was planned to be released January 1, 2010, but after the death of Director Anthony Minghella, Shekhar Kapur took over his unfinished movie, "New York, I Love You", and "Larklight" had to be postponed.

SM UC-11

SM "UC-11" was a German Type UC I minelayer submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. The U-boat was ordered on 23 November 1914, laid down on 26 January 1915, and was launched on 11 April 1915. She was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 23 April 1915 as SM "UC-11". Mines laid by "UC-11" in her 83 patrols were credited with sinking 27 ships. "UC-11" was mined and sunk on 26 June 1918.

SM UC-12

SM "UC-12" was a German Type UC I minelayer submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I.
Construction.
The U-boat was ordered on 23 November 1914, laid down on 27 January 1915, and was launched on 29 April 1915. She was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 2 May 1915 as SM "UC-12".
Service history.
"UC-12" served with the Pola Flotilla based at Cattaro in the Adriatic. She operated as a minelayer, and undertook seven patrols in this role. Mines laid by "UC-12" were credited with sinking six ships. One of these, the Italian "Marechiaro" sunk on 21 February 1916, was listed as a hospital ship and sank with over 200 casualties.
Since Germany was not at war with Italy at this stage, though Austria was, "UC 12", like other German U-boats in the Mediterranean, operated under the Austro-Hungarian flag.
Fate.
On 16 March 1916 "UC-12" was sunk by the detonation of one of her own mines while laying a mine fields off Taranto harbour. Italian divers inspected the wreck and established its identity. The knowledge that Germany, technically their ally, was assiduously mining their naval bases was a contributing factor in Italy’s decision in May 1916 to declare war on Germany.
The submarine was raised by Italy and commissioned as X-1 in the Italian Royal Navy.

Mines laid by "UC-13" in her 3 patrols were credited with sinking 3 ships.
Fate.
"UC-13" departed Constantinople on 12 November 1915 to operate in the Black Sea. On 29 November, while navigating using dead reckoning due to the adverse weather, she ran aground east of the Bosphorous, near to the Melen River. The crew subsequently scuttled "UC-13" using demolition charges before being picked up by Turkish vessels.

GRB 080916C

GRB 080916C is a gamma-ray burst (GRB) that was recorded on September 16, 2008 in the Carina constellation and detected by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. It is the most powerful gamma-ray burst ever recorded. The explosion had the energy of approximately 5900 type Ia supernova, and the gas jets emitting the initial gamma rays moved at a minimum velocity of approximately 299,792,158 m/s (0.999999c), making this blast the most extreme recorded to date.
The energy comparison with a supernova ignores that most of the energy of a supernova is carried away in the neutrino burst. The total isotropic energy of GRB 080916C is estimated at () (the oft quoted 4.9 times the sun’s mass turned to energy) and should be jet-corrected to a much lower actual energy output due to the narrow angular width of the actual bursting jet. Thus it would be significantly less than the energy of a supernova neutrino burst, but is about equal to the energy in a supernova’s material explosion. Also, the peak energy flux of GRB 080916C is significantly less than a number of other GRB’s, such as GRB 080319B which peaked at nearly () in visible light alone. However, the total energy flux of the very long duration GRB 080916C is higher than any other measured GRB to date.
The 16.5-second delay for the highest-energy gamma ray observed in this burst is consistent with some theories of quantum gravity, which state that all forms of light may not travel through space at the same speed. Very-high-energy gamma rays may be slowed down as they propagate through the quantum turbulence of space-time.
The explosion took place 12.2 billion light-years (light travel distance) away. That means it occurred 12.2 billion years ago—when the universe was only about 1.5 billion years old. The burst lasted for 23 minutes, almost 700 times as long as the two-second average for high energy GRBs. Follow-up observations were made 32 hours after the blast using the Gamma-Ray Burst Optical/Near-Infrared Detector (GROND) on the 2.2 metre telescope at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile, allowing astronomers to pinpoint the blast’s distance to 12.2 billion light years.

Dale McBride

Dale McBride (December 18, 1936 - November 30, 1992) was an American country music singer. In the 1970s, he charted several singles on the "Billboard" country charts, including two Top 40 hits on the Con Brio Records label. His son is Terry McBride, who fronted the 1990s country band McBride & the Ride and has written singles for Brooks & Dunn. Dale McBride died in 1992 of a brain tumor.
Biography.
Dale McBride was born in Lampasas, Texas on December 18, 1936. He began recording in the 1950s, having several local rockabilly hits in Mississippi. In the late 1960s, McBride was discovered by Dean Martin, who signed him to a contract with Reprise Records. At the time, however, the label was focused mainly on adult contemporary, and McBride did not have significant success on the label. He later founded his own, Thunderbird Records, where he began recording country music cover songs and original material. This label also produced his first chart single in "Corpus Christi Wind".
Between 1976 and 1979, McBride recorded for Con Brio Records, charting several singles including two Top 40 country hits. After leaving the label, he continued to record into the 1980s, with his son Terry playing in his band. Terry McBride had several chart singles in the 1990s as lead singer of the band McBride & the Ride. Dale McBride died of a brain tumor in 1992.
In 2007, GMV Nashville released a remastered version of "The Dale McBride Collection", an album originally released in 1992 following McBride's death. Soon after in 2008, the label also released "Takin' A Long Look".

The Pre-Angkorian temple complex of Sambor Prei Kuk () is located about 30 kilometers to the north of the town of Kampong Thom, Cambodia. It was also known as Isanapura, and was the capital of the Chenla Kingdom.
Located on the Eastern bank of Tonle Sap close to the Sen River, the central part of Sambor Prei Kuk is divided into three main groups. Each group is located in a square lay out surrounded by a brick wall. The structures of the overall archaeological area were constructed at variable times: the southern and north groups (7th century) by Isanavarman I, and the central group (later date). The buildings of Sambor Prei Kuk are characteristic of the Pre-Angkorean period with a simple external plan. The principal material is brick, but sandstone is also used for certain structures.
Architectural features include numerous prasats, octagonal towers, shiva lingams and yonis, ponds and reservoirs, and lion sculptures. Sambor Prei Kuk is located amidst mature sub-tropical forests with limited undergrowth. The area has been mined and could still contain unexploded ordnance. 
World Heritage Status.
This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on September 1st, 1992 in the Cultural category.

<doc id="21623753" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21623753" title="Switzerland Trail">
Switzerland Trail

The Switzerland Trail is the site of a historic narrow gauge railroad line that was operated at different times by the Greeley, Salt Lake and Pacific Railway, the Colorado and Northwestern Railroad, and the Denver, Boulder, and Western Railroad around the turn of the 20th century in the Colorado front range mining area near Nederland, Gold Hill, and Ward. The west end of the trail is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the "Denver, Boulder and Western Railway Historic District".
Description.
The earliest segment of the trail dates to 1883, with continual track growth until 1894 by the GSL&P, when a large flood destroyed many tracks and bankrupted the company. In 1896 the line was reopened as the C&N took over, completing many spur lines and the southern branch of the Switzerland Trail. The C&N is responsible for the name "Switzerland Trail", given in 1898 in a successful attempt to attract the tourist trade. By the end of the '00s, the C&N had folded and the DB&W took over. In 1919 the line was shut down and the tracks were subsequently pulled up, but the roadbed remains. A large portion of the roadbed is "maintained" (benignly neglected) as a hiking/biking trail as part of the Boulder County road system. It was, and remains, well known for its beautiful scenic views of the Front Range hills.
The remaining mountain route, about 30 miles long, winds between altitudes of 7,000 and over 9,000 feet, from the townsite of Eldora, Colorado, past Nederland, on north through Sugar Loaf and, ultimately, Ward. The line winds past several local historically prominent mines, including the Blue Bird Mine and a few miles from the Caribou Mine in the then-bustling (now ghost-) town of Caribou. The main line originated in Boulder, Colorado, coming up Fourmile Canyon through the mining communities of Salina, Colorado and Crisman, Colorado. It was connected via a three-rail track shared with railroads to Denver, Colorado.
In its heyday, near the turn of the twentieth century, the Switzerland Trail was the major source of bulk transportation in the area, carrying supplies and tourists to mining camps and towns in the front range, ore from the myriad mines to a few centralized mills, and refined metal down to Boulder for transport to the rest of the nation. A federal ore assay office, built at the turn of the 20th century, was located near the now-sleepy community of Wall Street, Colorado, at the intersection of the Switzerland Trail route with Fourmile Canyon. At the time Sunset was a bustling community, driven by the presence of an ore mill and the railroad. The building remains and is now something of a curiosity: the James F. Bailey Assay Office Museum, located in Wallstreet, Colorado, now a somewhat remote grouping of houses at least 20 minutes by car from the nearest town (Boulder). The C&N and the DB&W railroads were more canny than the GSL&P, and did a brisk business transporting tourists from Boulder and Denver up into the mountains. Several dedicated park sites and hotels (including the Mont Alto park site, its location now marked by a sign) were built or encouraged by the railroad to draw day-trippers.
The demise of the line came from a variety of factors, including: the extremely harsh winter conditions in the Rocky Mountains, which limited the tourist trade to about four months per year, forced frequent line closures, and periodically killed train crews; the invention and rise of the automobile; mine closures in Ward and Eldora; and failure of several ventures including a long tunnel/adit mine that was to be dug from Sunset into rich underground gold seams to the northwest.
The Switzerland Trail remains a well known hiking and biking trail because the smooth grade and 2%-5% slope of the railway make an easy traverse, while the narrowness of the railbed (typically 8–10 feet wide) brings users close to the spectacular terrain.

Bolus of Mendes

Bolus of Mendes ( "Bolos"; fl. 3rd century BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, a neo-Pythagorean writer of works of esoterica and medical works, who worked in Ptolemaic Egypt. The Suda, and Eudocia after him, mention a Pythagorean philosopher of Mendes in Egypt, who wrote on marvels, potent remedies, and astronomical phenomena. The Suda, however, also describes a Bolus who was a philosopher of the school of Democritus, who wrote "Inquiry", and "Medical Art", containing "natural medical remedies from some resources of nature." But, from a passage of Columella, it appears that Bolos of Mendes and the follower of Democritus were one and the same person; and he seems to have lived following the time of Theophrastus, whose work "On Plants" he appears to have known.

David Wyatt

Davit Wyatt (Born 28 November 1968) is an English commercial artist. Born in Northampton, he was adopted and raised in West Sussex. As a child, he learnt to play the piano; however, his interest in reading and drawing combined into a love of comics.
At 16, he attended art college in Reading, and obtained his first work doing the occasional page for British comic 2000 AD. He signed on for a further year at college, but left just two weeks later.
Whilst having some menial jobs, he worked on his portfolio, practiced guitar and played in bands. He created the occasional cover commissions, but was just as keen to make a career in music. After an unsuccessful band tour of Scandinavia, he decided that the rock and roll lifestyle wasn't for him, and moved to Dartmoor to concentrate on illustration.
David has tried most media at some point (collage, acrylics, sculpture, thick paint, thin paint), but now mainly produce work on an Apple Mac. The Dartmoor landscape provides inspiration; otherwise his ideas come from everywhere - "watching a film, walking round Sydney Opera house, the dog pulling a stupid face; anything."
Wyatt has illustrated "Peter Pan in Scarlet" by Geraldine McCaughrean (Illustrated Edition, 2008)
and the Larklight trilogy and the Mortal Engines and Fever Crumb quartets by Philip Reeve.
He has also illustrated books by J. R. R. Tolkien, Diana Wynne Jones, Terry Pratchett, Philip Pullman, Terry Deary and Brian Jacques. 
He was the cover artist for the 8-volume fantasy school stories "Children of the Red King" by Jenny Nimmo (2002 to 2009).
He has also worked on album covers, computer games, beer labels and stamps.
Wyatt lives in Devon, in a market town on Dartmoor. He is a keen lutist, cyclist and wanderer of the moors.

USS De Grasse (ID-1217)

USS "De Grasse" (ID-1217) was the projected name for an armed yacht that the United States Navy acquired for service as a patrol vessel in 1918 but, according to some sources, never commissioned, although other sources claim she saw brief naval service in 1918.
"De Grasse" was under construction as a wooden-hulled, steam turbine-powered private yacht by George Lawley and Sons at Neponset, Massachusetts, for J. L. Redmond of New York City on 7 June 1917 when the U.S. Navy ordered her taken over for World War I service upon completion and assigned her the Naval Registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1217. She was completed in 1918, and Commandant, 1st Naval District, took control of her on 18 July 1918 in anticipation of commissioning her as USS "De Grasse".
On 27 July 1918, the Commandant received orders to have "De Grasse" inspected for naval service. Tests and sea trials quickly took place at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, and revealed, as stated in a report dated 31 July 1918, that "De Grasse" was “unseaworthy” and of “no value for naval operations.”
Sources differ on whether "De Grasse" saw any naval service at all. Some say that she was commissioned in July 1918 and briefly served in coastal waters along the central portion of the United States East Coast, while others claim that the negative 31 July 1918 inspection report led to her never being commissioned or seeing naval service.
Directed on 17 August 1918 to return "De Grasse" to her owner, Commandant, 1st Naval District, returned her to Redmond on 7 November 1918 and provided him with $500.00 (USD) “for restoration of ship [to its former condition.”

Ponderosa (Sheffield)

The Ponderosa is a recreation area within the City of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. Although not a public park it was designated as Open Space by Sheffield City Council in the 1993 Unitary Development Plan. It covers an area of over 10 hectares (25 acres) and is located at , 1.5 km west of the city centre between the districts of Upperthorpe and Netherthorpe. Although the name “Ponderosa” was originally an informal name given by local children, it is now the accepted title and is recognised by the local council. Along with Weston Park and Crookes Valley Park it is one of the three “Crookesmoor Parks”.
History.
The Ponderosa can be split into two distinct halves, each with contrasting history. The upper part was for many years known as Crookesmoor Recreation Ground, however prior to that it was an area of small dams in open countryside. The dams were built around 1740 by Joshua Matthewman after he had gained permission from the Lord of the Manor, Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk. The dams were constructed to impound local spring water to supply the town of Sheffield. J. Tayler’s map of Sheffield of 1832 shows a string of four small dams below (north) of what is now Crookes Valley Road and on the site of the present day upper Ponderosa. These four dams were filled in during the second half of the 19th century and by 1903 it was shown on the map as Crookesmoor Recreation Ground. During World War II the recreation ground was used as a station for barrage balloons to defend the city.
In the first half of the 19th century the lower part of The Ponderosa was open countryside just to the south west of the Sheffield General Infirmary which at that time stood in a rural location to the west of the town. During the second half of the 1800s an area of back-to-back houses known as the Port Mahon estate was constructed on the site. This housing stood until the 1960s when it was demolished as part of a programme of urban development in the Upperthorpe and Netherthorpe areas. Certain throughfares such as Wentworth Street and Burlington Street disappeared altogether and the housing was replaced by tower blocks and maisonettes leaving a central area for recreation. This recreation area was christened “The Ponderosa” by local children after the name of the ranch in the TV series Bonanza which was popular throughout the 1960s.
Present day.
In the 1960s the area was a bare open bowl but much appreciated and used by the local community for games and community events. Since then there has been much development. The upper part of the Ponderosa is clothed in woodland, scrub, meadow and rough grassland which gives a fine environment for wildlife. Foxes and Kestrels are often seen and there is a wealth of bird and butterfly species. The upper part also contains an adventure playground and a mini football pitch. In 1999 the Crookes Valley Road entrance was given new gateway pillars, with each pillar consisting of three carved telegraph poles. The lower part of the Ponderosa stands in the shadow of seven tower blocks on its western side and St Stephen’s church on Fawcett Street on its eastern. This lower area has a children's playground and several wooded copses.
In 1990 The Ponderosa Environmental Group (PEG) was formed and planted a community orchard consisting of apple and plum trees. Since then more fruit trees and spring bulbs have been added as well as four acres of native woodland. The group is committed to improving the open space and played a major part in the campaign to prevent housing development on the Ponderosa in 1993.

Micajah C. Henley

Micajah C. Henley (1856-1927) was a Richmond, Indiana industrialist and inventor. He was a well known manufacturer of roller skates and bicycles sometimes known as "The Roller Skate King."
The Henley Roller Skate Works could turn out 2,000 pairs of roller skates in one day. He was granted at least two (2 of several held by Henley & Company) U.S. Patents for improvements to the Roller Skate in 1880 and 1881. Henley's Roller Skates were perhaps the best selling Roller Skates of the late 1890s.
Under the leadership of Henley, the workers at Henley Bicycle Works manufactured bicycles; roller skates; scooters; lawn furniture and lawn swings; iron working machinery; tools; boring, milling and screw driving machines used in wood manufacturing; gas meters; fence machines and lawn mowers. The company also provided nickel plating services.
Henley lived at 201 N. 14th Street in Richmond. The Wright Brothers lived at 211 N. 14th Street for a time. Henley sold Wilbur his first bicycle for $10, which Wilbur borrowed from his brother Orville. Thus the Wright brothers migrated from an interest in kites (which they were manufacturing in their father's carriage house) to bicycles.
In 1904, Henley expanded his business to include the automotive industry. He built an auto agency and service garage on Main Street where he commenced selling and servicing vehicles. In 1906, he sold the business (the Auto Inn) and leased the real estate to a firm named of Draper & Whitsell.
M.C. Henley grew his business operation from a small outbuilding at the rear of his home, to a large modern factory which he built on North 16th Street in 1884. The buildings are still standing in 2009.
Micajah C. Henley and his wife, Addie W. (1856-1943) are buried at Earlham Cemetery in Richmond, Indiana.
Patents.
M.C. Henley held several U.S. Patents, a partial list is included below, along with reference numbers.

Darren Wassall

Darren Wassall (born 27 June 1968 in Edgbaston) is a retired English football defender. He is currently the Academy Manager at Derby County and briefly acted as Caretaker Manager following the dismissal of Nigel Clough.
Career.
Wassall began his career in 1984 at Nottingham Forest, where he was a product of the youth system. He failed to win a regular first team place, although he was a reliable stand-in to the likes of Des Walker, and was loaned out to Hereford United and Bury. Despite his limited opportunities Wassall featured in two finals for Forest, winning a medal in the 1992 Zenith Data Systems 3–2 triumph over Southampton (having scored his one and only Forest goal in the semi-final second leg against Leicester City at the City Ground) and playing in the 1–0 defeat in the 1992 Football League Cup Final against Manchester United. He left Forest for Derby County in 1992 in a £600,000 deal amid rumours of a dressing room incident with manager Brian Clough which left Wassall feeling unable to remain at Forest. Whilst at Derby he had loan spells at Manchester City and Birmingham City.
Wassall joined Birmingham full-time in 1997 in a £150,000 deal, although his impact was limited as he struggled with injuries. He retired in 2000 after suffering an achilles injury. However Wassall was able to continue playing by dropping out of the Football League and playing for Burton Albion. He retired altogether in 2005 to take charge of the club's youth team. He scored once during his spell at Burton, his goal coming in a 4-2 FA Cup defeat to Kidderminster Harriers in November 2000.
In 2009, Wassall became Academy Manager at Derby County under Nigel Clough's regime. He is still in the position and is responsible for bringing through a number of players to Derby's first team including Mark O'Brien, Callum Ball, Jeff Hendrick, Mason Bennett and Will Hughes. In May 2013, Wassall was rewarded for his work, winning the President's Award at the clubs awards night. 
In September 2013, Nigel Clough was sacked by Derby County, and his back room staff sent on gardening leave. However, Wassall remained at the club, continuing his work with the youth academy under the tenure of new Derby County Head Coach Steve McClaren.

<doc id="21623951" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21623951" title="The Temple (Oates short story)">
The Temple (Oates short story)

"The Temple" (1996) is a third-person narrative short story by the writer Joyce Carol Oates.
Plot.
The story is about a woman who constantly hears a mysterious sound that at first sounds like an animal stranded within an area outside but the stronger the noise gets the more the woman realizes it is something else. The noise is horrid to hear according to Oates, "How like baby's cry, terribly distressing to hear! and the scratching which came in spasmodic, desperate flurries, was yet more distressing, evoking an obscure horror." The more she hears this wretched noise, the more anxious she becomes to find the source. She finally sends herself on a mission, gathering her gardening tools and setting out to find where the noises are coming from.
The more she digs, the closer she gets to the source, until she finds the source of the noise; a child's skull.
She removes the years of dust from the skull, not much is left of it. There is no hair to uncover and there are some teeth missing. She begins to dig deeper where she found the skull and finds numerous pieces of bone, which lead her to believe that they are missing pieces of the child's skull. She brings the skull and the rest of the bones into her house where she wraps them in a velvet cloth and promises the skeleton that she will always be here for it, she will never leave it. She lays the skeleton near her bed in human form. In the last paragraph of the story, after discussing how the skeleton is laid out, Oates says, "In this way the woman's bedroom became a secret temple. On the velvet cloth the skull and bones, unnamed, would be discovered after the woman's death, but that was a long way off."
Characters.
There are two characters throughout this short story.
The first character is the woman who hears the noises in her garden and digs to find the source. The second character is the skeleton that is found by the woman and is placed in a velvet cloth and set on a mantle.
Publication history.
"The Temple" was first published in the 1996 compilation of short stories called American Gothic Tales. The short stories was edited by Joyce Carol Oates and includes short stories by Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, Shirley Jackson, Stephen King, and many others.
Analysis.
In "The Temple," the story seems to mainly rely on the idea of dependency of an object. This story is of a woman who fights to find the scratching and screeching noises that she constantly hears. She becomes obsessed with the sounds and is determined to help it. The story begins to make the reader believe that it is her duty to discover the object that is causing all the noises, as if they are purposely occurring. When she finally sets out to find the skull, the noises become stronger and stronger. She uncovers the skull and skeleton in her garden and says to it, "I will never abandon you". There is a sense of dependency that grows on this woman when she develops her own duties for the skull and builds a responsibility for creating a memorial in her bedroom for the child. Her bedroom becomes a temple for the child where she is able to protect and look out for the skeleton that lays in a velvet cloth at an altar.
Terror and horror in "The Temple".
Often in American Gothic Literature there is a state of terror and horror within a story. Terror is the anticipation within the story while Horror is the realization. The following describes how The Temple shows Terror and Horror throughout the story.
The temple builds terror by the constant screeching the constant noise that the woman hears! Terror builds inside the reader as they imagine themselves in that situation. What if this noise would not leave? The terror hits a high when she begins to dig and dig into the grounds to discover the noise. It’s almost as if the noise knows she is there and about to release her.
Horror within this story is when she actually finds the young child’s skull and then multiple bones to go along with the skull. The horror in The Temple is the fact that when this child’s skeleton is found the noise stops.
Terror is also built up with the anticipation of what she is going to do with the bones. 
Horror is then brought to life when she lays out the skeleton on a velvet cloth and puts it on an altar, swearing that it will never be alone. This becomes the temple! 
Domestic Abjection – Strange within the familiar.
How does The Temple portray a Gothic theme within this story? Below is an analysis on how the famous author, Alan Lloyd-Smith determines this in his book, "American Gothic Fiction: An Introduction".
Lloyd-Smith uses an interpretation by Julia Kristeva of abjection. She says, "a weight of meaninglessness, about which there is nothing insignificant, and which crushes me." This suggests the feeling of despair that some writers are able to create in some readers of Gothic Fiction.
A term called "jouissance" is used to describe abjection. In the story she states, "jouissance alone causes abject to exist as such...one joys in it...violently and painfully." This suggests strangeness, a perverseness in that which causes joy. The altar in "The Temple" - the woman had to know it was creepy to keep a skeleton in her bedroom but it brought her joy to do so. 
The question is why did it bring her joy, whatever it was must have overpowered the creepy factor. Was she lonely, a widow, a mother that lost a child, or just maybe mentally unstable? These types of questions add to the gothic interpretation to the story and help make the story interesting. 
How Obsession Helps portray Gothic Literature.
The woman becomes obsessed with the sound and then with the child skeleton. The fact that she becomes obsessed with these objects that help portray terror versus horror help intensify the creepiness and indulge a reader and makes it enticing enough to continue reading upon completion of the story.
Irrational vs Rational and how that helps bring gothic to life in "The Temple".
Lloyd-Smith concludes that Gothic fiction emphasizes that rationality is a mask that obscures but does not eliminate the irrational.

Ernst Valenta

Ernst Valenta (; 25 October 1912 – 31 March 1944) was a Czechoslovak member of the Royal Air Force murdered by the Gestapo in March 1944.
Capture.
Valenta's final flight was a mission in a Vickers Wellington Mk.IC, operated by No. 311 Squadron RAF, a Czechoslovakian manned bomber squadron. He departed from the airport at East Wretham on 6 February 1941 for a mission to Boulogne. He was force-landed and his aircraft was captured intact at an unknown location. The Wellington was later flown by the Luftwaffe at its Experimental and Test Facility at Rechlin.
The great escape.
Valenta was one of 50 men killed following a mass escape from Stalag Luft III prisoner of war camp in World War II.
The camp was located in Sagan (now Żagań) in Poland.
Reportedly, he was amongst early pairs of escapees from the tunnel during the escape attempt of 24 March 1944. Recaptured in the Görlitz area and last seen alive on 31 March 1944, he was amongst a group of ten RAF officers in the charge of Oberregierungsrat Walter Scharpwinkel.
Fifty of the recaptured escapees were murdered by the Gestapo on Hitler's orders.

Wear My Hat

"Wear My Hat" is a song by English singer Phil Collins released as the fifth single from his album "Dance into the Light". It was only released in the United Kingdom and peaked at #43 on the UK Singles Chart. Collins said in an interview that the song and its music video is about the pressures of fame and how some fans grow an attachment to their favourite stars. The video for the song featured actor Danny DeVito.
The song was played throughout the Trip into the Light World Tour and on the First Final Farewell Tour. A live performance of the song was also recorded for "Top of the Pops". However it was not aired (at the time) most likely due to its very low charting position, but it was then was shown in full on an episode of "Top of the Pops 2" several years later.

<doc id="21624038" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21624038" title="Government of Massachusetts">
Government of Massachusetts

The form of Massachusetts government is provided by the Constitution of the Commonwealth. The legislative power is exercised by the bicameral General Court, which is composed of the Senate and House of Representatives. The executive power generally is exercised by the Governor, although only after receiving the advice and consent of the Governor's Council with respect to certain subjects. Several other officers, including the Attorney General and Secretary of the Commonwealth, perform executive functions and are elected independently. The judicial power is reposed in the Supreme Judicial Court, which superintends the entire system of courts. Cities and towns also act through local governmental bodies that possess only the authority granted to them by the Commonwealth over local issues, including limited "home rule" authority. Most county governments were abolished in the 1990s, although a handful remain.
The capital of Massachusetts is Boston. The seat of power is Beacon Hill, which is home to the legislative and executive branches. The Supreme Judicial Court occupies nearby Pemberton Hill.
Legislature.
The state legislature is formally known as the General Court, reflecting its former judicial duties in the colonial era. It is composed of two houses: the Massachusetts Senate, which has 40 members, and the Massachusetts House of Representatives, which has 160 members. All members in both houses face election every two years. The Democratic Party holds a supermajority in each of the two chambers. The current President of the Senate is Therese Murray, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives is Robert DeLeo. Given the power they hold, the positions of these two leaders are often considered, along with the Governor's, when evaluating the prospects of changing state law.
Executive.
There are 151 departments or agencies in Massachusetts, and over 700 independent boards and commissions. The Governor exercises direct control over many of the largest agencies, but only indirect control over independent entities through appointments.
Elected Officials.
Some executive agencies are delegated by the legislature with the responsibility of formulating regulations by following a prescribed procedure. Most of these are collected in the Code of Massachusetts Regulations.
Governor's Cabinet.
The governor has a cabinet of ten secretaries. In general, they supervise the state agencies which are under the direct control of the governor. Eight of the secretaries preside over the "Executive Office of" their respective areas.
Judiciary.
Supreme Judicial Court
Appeals Court
Trial Courts:
Local government.
Massachusetts shares with the five other New England states a governmental structure known as the New England town. Only the southeastern third of the state has functioning county governments; in western, central, and northeastern Massachusetts, traditional county-level government was eliminated in the late 1990s.
The incorporation of land.
In many other states, a town is a compact incorporated area; between the towns are unincorporated areas, usually quite large, that do not belong to any town. Such states are completely apportioned into counties, and county governments have significant importance, particularly to those living outside towns, and often perform major functions such as providing police and fire services and operating airports.
In contrast, all of the land in Massachusetts is divided up among the cities and towns and there are no "unincorporated" areas or population centers, nor townships. (This is generally true of most of the New England states, and is described at length at New England town.) This complicates comparisons with other non-New England states. The U.S. Census Bureau considers Massachusetts cities and towns to be minor civil divisions, equivalent to townships in other states, but townships usually have weaker forms of government. Many Massachusetts residents also identify with neighborhoods, villages, or other districts of their towns and cities.
Limits to municipal government.
Many Massachusetts towns were established during the British colonial period, long before the existence of an independent United States. The Massachusetts Constitution was written before the end of the American Revolution (1780). This constitution re-established the relationship between the state government and the towns which was originally specified by the charter which was granted to the Massachusetts Bay Company by King Charles I in 1629.
In 1966, the Home Rule Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution created a limited home rule mechanism granting certain powers to cities and towns. According to the Amendment:
The legislature is prohibited from passing any special laws that affect fewer than two municipalities, except in any of the following circumstances:
Many municipalities seek approval for special legislation giving them desired powers, which may or may not be available to them under the blanket grant of Home Rule, due to potentially conflicting state laws.
The Zoning Act grants substantial zoning powers to municipalities. The Massachusetts Subdivision Control Law also concerns land use regulation.
Form of government: city vs. town.
The distinction between a "city" and "town" as defined in Massachusetts law is primarily related to the form of government that the municipality has chosen. A town is governed under the selectmen and Town Meeting or Representative Town Meeting form of government. A city has a council or board of aldermen (and may or may not have a mayor, a city manager, or both). This distinction dates to the April 9, 1821, when an amendment to the state constitution was approved that permitted a non-town meeting form of municipal government. Prior to that time, each municipality was authorized to be governed by a Town Meeting only. On February 23, 1822, the Governor approved the act establishing "the City of Boston." The new charter was drafted by Lemuel Shaw, later Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The voters of Boston approved the acceptance of the proposed city charter on March 4, 1822.
The state Constitution stipulates that any municipality that has a population under 12,000 cannot adopt "city" form of government and charter; any "town" with less than 6,000 population cannot adopt a Representative Town Meeting charter and form of government. This applies whether or not the municipality has adopted a Home Rule Charter. Other details of city and town government are left to the legislature.
State law defines six possible options for city governments:
There are also certain operational differences between cities and towns. A "city" has a clearly structured annual budget process, set out in statute, and the legislative body is prohibited from increasing any appropriation above the amount recommended by the mayor or other chief executive. Changes to town by-laws require approval by the Massachusetts Attorney General, but changes to city ordinances do not.
A 1966 amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution affirmed the right of local municipalities to self-government and to the exercise of powers not inconsistent with state law. It also prohibited the state legislature from abolishing or combining cities and towns without their consent, and made it illegal for the legislature to enact legislation affecting only one municipality without that community's request or consent.
As part of the amendment, Massachusetts for the first time allowed cities and towns to draft and adopt their own home rule charters without receiving permission or approval from the state. The legislature adopted the state Home Rule Procedures Act to establish a process to accomplish the constitutional mandate.
For towns without a home rule charter, changes in the structure of the local government must be approved by petitioning the General Court for special legislation giving it that authority, or through adoption of one of the so-call Acceptance Act Charters, A through F. Communities with home rule charters must also request a Special Act in order to exercise a power the state has reserved to itself, such as increase the number of liquor licenses allowed in a city or town.
As of 2000, 71 municipalities had adopted home-rule charters under the Home Rule Amendment procedure, 13 operated under charters granted by Special Acts of the legislature passed before the Home Rule Amendment, and 19 operated under Special Acts pass after the Home Rule Amendment.
Out of fifty three cities in the Commonwealth, there are now eleven that are legally cities and have city councils, but retained "Town of" in their names. This distinction derives from provisions of state law that reference the town meeting form of government and that provide for greater self-governance authority for the class of communities governed by a form of chief executive and council which are referred to as cities in state law.
Communities adopting a city form while retaining "Town of" as their name are: Agawam, Amesbury, Barnstable, Braintree, Franklin, Greenfield, Palmer, Southbridge, Watertown, West Springfield, Weymouth, and Winthrop.
Legal opinions provided to charter commissions in some of first of the 11 communities adopting a style of government that the General Laws referred to as a city form suggested that for clarity the community be referenced as "the City Known as the Town of X" as its legal name. The term "town" was retained in many cases because a suburban community did not desire to be known as a "city" with the urban issues the name implies, but wished to adopt the city form of government.
How a municipality refers to itself has been said to be a decision that is up to the community. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that what a municipality calls itself doesn't matter: "It is the substance of the thing done, and not the name given to it, which controls". Opinion of the Justices to the Senate, 229 Mass. 600 (Mass. 1918). The "City known as the Town of" reference was intended in communities adopting it to assert its right to exercise the authority of a city in governance, municipal finance and procurement. In the early days of the spread of the council-based municipal government to towns, it served to eliminate confusion as to a town's ability to do a particular thing.
Prior to the adoption of the Home Rule Amendment, no town had become a city in Massachusetts for 45 years, while four made the change in the first 10 years following the adoption of home rule.
Schools.
Primary and secondary school attendance is compulsory and free for Massachusetts residents aged 6 – 16.
State law is developed into regulations by the Massachusetts Board of Education to govern local, regional, vocational, and charter schools.
All school districts in Massachusetts must employ a superintendent and business (or finance) manager. Many districts also have assistant or associate superintendents, pupil services directors, special education directors, and other administrators, although these are not required by state law.
Generally speaking, there are three kinds of public schools in Massachusetts, plus independent "charter schools."
Massachusetts has a school choice law which allows students to attend a school in a district outside their municipality if the other district has space and approves.
Kindergarten through twelfth grade (K-12) students may also attend private schools. Private schools are not state-funded and generally charge tuition. Many are parochial schools operated by subdivisions of the Roman Catholic Church.
"Such attendance shall not be required of a child ... who is being otherwise instructed in a manner approved in advance by the superintendent or the school committee."—Chapter 76, Section 1.
School funding and construction.
The cost of operating public schools comes from two sources: local government, funded primarily by the property tax, and payments from the state Legislature (out of the state general fund), calculated to provide more aid to economically weaker school districts and thereby equalize educational opportunity across the state. These "Chapter 70" payments are in addition to separate local aid payments to town and city governments' general funds.
Cities and towns are required by state law to spend a minimum amount on education. This required amount is referred to as "Net School Spending" and is calculated as part of the Chapter 70 funding formula.
Each school district is allocated a certain amount of funding through a foundational budget, which is based on the amount of students that community is required to educate according to enrollment figures as of October 1 of the previous year, as well as the calculated wealth of a community. However, when a student transfers out of district to another public district, to a charter school, a public vocational school, etc., a certain amount of funding is transferred along with them.
School construction and renovation projects fall under the budgetary and land use powers of the municipalities rather than the school boards.
Growing abolition of county government.
By the 1990s, most functions of county governments (including operation of courts and road maintenance) had been taken over by the state, and most county governments were seen as inefficient and outmoded. The government of Suffolk County was substantially integrated with the city government of Boston more than one hundred years ago, to the extent that the members of the Boston city council are "ex officio" the Suffolk County Commissioners, and Boston's treasurer and auditor fulfill the same offices for the county. Thus, residents of the other three Suffolk County communities do not have a voice on the county commission, but all the county expenses are paid by the city of Boston.
The government of Nantucket County, which is geographically coterminous with the Town of Nantucket, is operated along similar lines — the town selectmen (executive branch) act as the county commissioners.
Mismanagement of Middlesex County's public hospital in the mid-1990s left that county on the brink of insolvency, and in 1997 the Massachusetts legislature stepped in by assuming all assets and obligations of the county. The government of Middlesex County was officially abolished on July 11, 1997. Later that year, the Franklin County Commission voted itself out of existence. The law abolishing Middlesex County also provided for the elimination of Hampden County and Worcester County on July 1, 1998. This law was later amended to abolish Hampshire County on January 1, 1999; Essex County and Suffolk County on July 1 of that same year; and Berkshire County on July 1, 2000. Chapter 34B of the Massachusetts General Laws allows other counties either to abolish themselves, or to reorganize as a "regional council of governments", as Hampshire and Franklin Counties have done. The governments of Bristol, Plymouth, and Norfolk Counties remain substantially unchanged. Barnstable and Dukes Counties have adopted modern county charters, enabling them to act as efficient regional governments. Dukes County in particular has a strong regional planning agency known as the Martha's Vineyard Commission.
District attorneys and sheriffs are elected by constituencies that mostly, but not entirely, follow county boundaries; they are funded by the state budget.
Government operations and services.
Police.
Many municipalities have their own police departments, as do many Massachusetts colleges and universities. Though most county governments have been abolished, each county still has a Sheriff's Department which operates jails and correctional facilities and service of process within the county.
The Massachusetts State Police have statewide jurisdiction, including full criminal law enforcement, Highway Patrol and traffic enforcement, investigation, and special air, marine, and tactical response. They share concurrent jurisdiction with municipal and institutional departments, and have primary jurisdiction in towns that have no local police force. State police divisions ("Troops") are dedicated to the Massachusetts Turnpike and Logan International Airport, and since 1992 the state police have had primary responsibility for the state capital building, facilities of the Registry of Motor Vehicles, and DCR parks. State police also have sole authority under state law for investigating homicides, except for Boston, Worcester, and Springfield.
Though fully deputized in 175 cities and towns, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police have primary responsibility for MBTA facilities and commuter railroads statewide, and share enforcement duties (such as writing tickets for parking in bus stops) with local and state police, especially in remote areas and on Massport property. The Massachusetts Environmental Police are also independent of the State Police.
A number of federal police agencies also operate in Massachusetts, subject to the limits and jurisdiction of federal law, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
Fire.
Fire protection is generally also provided by municipal fire departments. Massport has its own fire department, and its Fire Rescue provides protection on agency property. Fire departments have mutual aid agreements, such as the Massachusetts Metro Fire District in Greater Boston, which facilitate emergency response across department boundaries.
Water and sewer.
Water and sewer districts are generally operated at the municipal level, providing retail service to residential and business customers, and making provisions for sewage treatment and acquiring water from wells, rivers, or wholesaler. Some local water districts have been consolidated across municipal boundaries and some operate at the sub-municipal (village) level. Running water and sewer service is not necessarily available to all buildings, especially in low-density areas; building owners in these areas must obtain their own water and dispose of their own sewage.
The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority provides wholesale water and sewer services to many cities and towns, mostly in Greater Boston, in cooperation with DCR watershed land management. Combined sewers in some areas are being separated to reduce water pollution.
Open standards.
Beginning in 2003 Massachusetts became one of the first states specifically to address so-called open formats for its state government digital documents and address the importance of being able to read electronically stored public documents long after the application that created them was no longer supported or available. The effort was part of a wider effort by the state to standardize on an overall Enterprise Technical Reference Model (ETRM), an effort that was also announced in 2003.
However the process by which the standardized format issue was addressed by a small group of state information-technology (IT) employees, working behind closed doors according to a 2006 legislative report23 and possibly with favored technology suppliers according to media reports, was found to be ill-advised if not illegal. The IT employees involved worked for Eric Kriss, the state's then Secretary for Administration and Finance, an appointee of then Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. The legislative committee involved—known as the Massachusetts Senate Committee on Post Audit and Oversight—was controlled by the majority Democratic Party.
The committee had actually begun investigating the ETRM in 2003 when it was first announced because Kriss said at the time that
"Effective immediately, we will adopt… a comprehensive Open Standards, Open Source policy for all future IT investments…."
The committee immediately expressed concerns about the cost of the ETRM effort and the new Open-Standards/Open-Source (OS/OS) policy but questioned what Kriss meant by "we." As part of the governor's office, Kriss arguably had no constitutional or legal authority to put his department in charge of public records (which are the responsibility of a separate Massachusetts constitutional officer) and clearly had no constitutional authority for legislative- and judicial-branch public records. The legislative committee also questioned the process by which the ETRM would be developed.
Various versions of the ETRM were released between 2003 and 2005 but they received very little publicity because of their technical nature and the fact that the involved IT employees had not tried to dictate procurement policies that crossed into other non-IT departments, departments under the authority of separate constitutional officers, or departments reporting to the legislature or judiciary. Specifically, none of the first few ETRMs mentioned document formats other than to say that they were an issue that should be addressed in a future ETRM. But following a proposed open format standards meeting (link previously included in this article but no longer available on mass.gov site) held by Kriss on June 9, 2005; the standardization issue boiled over into a battle about what the term "open standards" meant. On August 31, 2005, Kriss' department released a revised draft of the ETRM that explicitly endorsed the OASIS OpenDocument format developed by Sun (JAVA) Microsystems along with following three other "standard" formats: HTML, Adobe PDF, and TXT.
Specifically not listed were any standards associated with Microsoft Office document-production applications even though Microsoft was the leading supplier of such applications to the state. "Standard" is in quotes above because PDF was no more a "standard" at the time than Microsoft's Office formats. The August 2005 release of the ETRM noted that the new "standards" would not go into effect until January 2007. The effort to freeze Microsoft out of such procurements was possibly part of a multiple-year process that began in 2002 with a study24 by a state-sponsored group called the IT Commission. The IT Commission was "facilitated" by IBM (IBM) consulting employees under contract and included a Sun employee but no Microsoft employee. IBM uses ODF in one of its less popular Lotus products or at least did so at the time. Procedurally, it would seem logical that Microsoft should have been represented on the commission or all vendors should have been barred.
In addition to the relevant official state documentation on the subject noted below, there is contemporaneous reporting of the non-public dealings about ODF between Sun and state IT employees on ZDnet.25 One of the sentences about what appears to be a Sun-ODF effort to manipulate the definition of open standards was this information from David Berlind of ZDnet in October 2005:
"Although it isn't clear what Massachusetts' test for openness was back in the early 2005 timeframe, it is clear that "the test" was officially revised... by the time (the latest Massachusetts' Enterprise Technical Reference Model) ETRM was ratified on Sept. 23..."
Why the test was revised was answered in 2006 in a Post-Audit and Oversight Committee report titled "Open Standards, Closed Government". The information about a flawed process developed by Berlind was confirmed in the legislative report, which said that August 2005 version of the ETRM was put together by a "kitchen cabinet", which not only failed to give outsiders such as Microsoft a reasonable chance to comment on or react to its plans but also froze out all other relevant Massachusetts IT groups, including the ones involved with aiding the disabled and those in charge of public records.
The legislative report lays out how this small IT group called the Information Technology Division (ITD)—remember despite all the surrounding publicity about the open standards issue in Massachusetts, this IT group is actually one department in one part of one branch of the Massachusetts government—took numerous steps to try to manipulate the document-preparation application procurement process. The legislative committee concluded that the group was:
"… not aware of the cost of the ETRM, the impact it could have on the state's public records, limitations on IT accessibility for persons with disabilities, that the agency excluded key governmental and advocacy groups, and that the proposal was issued in violation of state law."
The above is the summary; the details involve dozens of findings and recommendations and almost 100 footnotes. In particular, in terms of access for the disabled, the committee found:
1. "ITD released the ETRM despite public testimony that the OpenDocument Format ("ODF"), an ITD approved open standard, may impair IT accessibility for thousands of workers with disabilities. ITD, the Massachusetts Office on Disability and advocates from the disability community testified that the ODF may not be compatible with assistive technology, such as screen readers and voice recognition software, required by persons with disabilities.
2. "After seven months of negotiations, the Information Technology Division still has not completed a Memorandum of Understanding between state agencies and the Massachusetts Office on Disability to ensure accessibility of IT applications.
3. "The Committee learned that the state has had a history of accessibility problems with IT applications, including the state's human services website and the state's main website, Mass.gov."
Today as in 2005 the issue of document format standards is, as it should be, a minuscule part of Massachusetts's ETRM (now in its fifth version26). The exclusive ODF bias supposed to have gone into effect in January 2007 was stopped by the legislative committee's actions. Kriss—most likely coincidentally—left his position in October 2005, only a month after releasing ETRM 3.5. New IT management in state government gave Microsoft a chance to make the "open standard" formats list (which it did when OOXML was accepted as a standard by the ECMA in 2006) and it gave Sun a chance to make ODF handicapped accessible (and thereby stay on the list).
Massachusetts ETRM currently considers HTML, ODF, OOXML, PDF, RTF and Text to be acceptable document formats for public documents. The issue of accessibility for the disabled is now a key part of the IT procurement process. The issue of constitutional authority was never specifically settled but given the breadth of acceptable "open standard" formats, the issue is apparently moot.

Indian labour law

Indian labour law refers to laws regulating labour in India. Traditionally Indian governments at federal and state level have sought to ensure a high degree of protection for workers, but in practice, legislative rights only cover a minority of workers. India is a federal form of government and because labour is a subject in the concurrent list of the Indian Constitution, labour matters are in the jurisdiction of both central and state governments. Both central and state governments have enacted laws on labour relations and employment issues.
History.
Indian labour law is closely connected to the Indian independence movement, and the campaigns of passive resistance leading up to independence. While India was under colonial rule by the British Raj, labour rights, trade unions, and freedom of association were all suppressed. Workers who sought better conditions, and trade unions who campaigned through strike action were frequently, and violently suppressed. After independence was won in 1947, the Constitution of India of 1950 embedded a series of fundamental labour rights in the constitution, particularly the right to join and take action in a trade union, the principle of equality at work, and the aspiration of creating a living wage with decent working conditions.
Constitutional rights.
In the Constitution of India from 1950, articles 14-16, 19(1)(c), 23-24, 38, and 41-43A directly concern labour rights. Article 14 states everyone should be equal before the law, article 15 specifically says the state should not discriminate against citizens, and article 16 extends a right of "equality of opportunity" for employment or appointment under the state. Article 19(1)(c) gives everyone a specific right "to form associations or unions". Article 23 prohibits all trafficking and forced labour, while article 24 prohibits child labour under 14 years old in a factory, mine or "any other hazardous employment".
Articles 38-39, and 41-43A, however, like all rights listed in Part IV of the Constitution are not enforceable by courts, rather than creating an aspirational "duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws". The original justification for leaving such principles unenforceable by the courts was that democratically accountable institutions ought to be left with discretion, given the demands they could create on the state for funding from general taxation, although such views have since become controversial. Article 38(1) says that in general the state should "strive to promote the welfare of the people" with a "social order in which justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all the institutions of national life. In article 38(2) it goes on to say the state should "minimise the inequalities in income" and based on all other statuses. Article 41 creates a "right to work", which the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 attempts to put into practice. Article 42 requires the state to "make provision for securing just and human conditions of work and for maternity relief". Article 43 says workers should have the right to a living wage and "conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life". Article 43A, inserted by the Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India in 1976, creates a constitutional right to codetermination by requiring the state to legislate to "secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings".
Contract and rights.
Scope of protection.
Indian labour law makes a distinction between people who work in "organised" sectors and people working in "unorganised sectors". The laws list the different industrial sectors to which various labour rights apply. People who do not fall within these sectors, the ordinary law of contract applies.
India's labor laws underwent a major update in the Industrial Disputes Act of 1948. Since then, an additional 45 national laws expand or intersect with the 1948 act, and another 200 state laws control the relationships between the worker and the company. These laws mandate all aspects of employer-employee interaction, such as companies must keep 6 attendance logs, 10 different accounts for overtime wages, and file 5 types of annual returns. The scope of labour laws extend from regulating the height of urinals in workers' washrooms to how often a work space must be lime-washed. Inspectors can examine workspace anytime and declare fines for violation of any labour laws and regulations.
Employment contracts.
Among the employment contracts that are regulated in India, the regulation involves significant government involvement which is rare in developed countries. The Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act 1946 requires that employers have terms including working hours, leave, productivity goals, dismissal procedures or worker classifications, approved by a government body.
The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970 aims at regulating employment of contract labour so as to place it at par with labour employed directly. Women are now permitted to work night shifts too (10pm to 6am).
The Latin phrase 'dies non' is being widely used by disciplinary authorities in government and industries for denoting the 'unauthorised absence' to the delinquent employees. According to Shri R. P.Saxena, Chief Engineer, Indian Railways, dies-non is a period which neither counted in service nor considered as break in service. A person can be marked dies-non, if
In cases of such willful and unauthorised absence from work, the leave sanctioning authority may decide and order that the days on which the work is not performed be treated as dies non-on the principle of no work no pay. This will be without prejudice to any other action that the competent authority might take against the persons resorting to such practises. The principle of "no work no pay" is widely being used in the banking industry in India. All other manufacturing industries and large service establishments like railways,posts and telecommunications are also implementing it to minimise the incidences of unauthorised absence of workers. The term 'industry' infuses a contractual relationship between the employer and the employee for sale of products and services which are produced through their cooperative endeavor.
This contract together with the need to put in efforts in producing goods and services imposes duties (including ancillary duties) and obligations on the part of the employees to render services with the tools provided and in a place and time fixed by the employer. And in return, as a quid pro quo, the employer is enjoined to pay wages for work done and or for fulfilling the contract of employment.Duties generally, including ancillary duties, additional duties, normal duties, emergency duties, which have to be done by the employees and payment of wages therefor. Where the contract of employment is not fulfilled or work is not done as prescribed, the principle of 'no work no pay' is brought into play.
Wage regulation.
The Payment of Wages Act 1936 requires that employees receive wages, on time, and without any unauthorised deductions. Section 6 requires that people are paid in money rather than in kind. The law also provides the tax withholdings the employer must deduct and pay to the central or state government before distributing the wages.
The Minimum Wages Act 1948 sets wages for the different economic sectors that it states it will cover. It leaves a large number of workers unregulated. Central and state governments have discretion to set wages according to kind of work and location, and they range between as much as 143 to 1120 per day for work in the so-called central sphere. State governments have their own minimum wage schedules.
The Payment of Gratuity Act 1972 applies to establishments with over 10 workers. Gratuity is payable to the employee if he or she resigns or retires. The Indian government mandates that this payment be at the rate of 15 days salary of the employee for each completed year of service subject to a maximum of 1000000.
The Payment of Bonus Act 1965, which applies only to enterprises with over 20 people, requires bonuses are paid out of profits based on productivity. The minimum bonus is currently 8.33 per cent of salary.
Health and safety.
The Workmen's Compensation Act 1923 requires that compensation is paid if workers are injured in the course of employment for injuries, or benefits to dependants. The rates are low.
Pensions and insurance.
The Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952 created the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation of India. This functions as a pension fund for old age security for the organised workforce sector. For those workers, it creates Provident Fund to which employees and employers contribute equally, and the minimum contributions are 10-12 per cent of wages. On retirement, employees may draw their pension.
The Employees' State Insurance provides health and social security insurance. This was created by the Employees' State Insurance Act 1948.
The Unorganised Workers' Social Security Act 2008 was passed to extend the coverage of life and disability benefits, health and maternity benefits, and old age protection for unorganised workers. "Unorganised" is defined as home-based workers, self-employed workers or daily-wage workers. The central government was meant to formulate the welfare system through rules produced by the National Social Security Board.
The Maternity Benefit Act 1961, creates rights to payments of maternity benefits for any woman employee who worked in any establishment for a period of at least 80 days during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery.
Workplace participation.
Trade unions.
Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution of India gives everyone an enforceable right "to form associations or unions".
The Trade Unions Act 1926, amended in 2001, contains rules on governance and general rights of trade unions.
Management participation.
It was the view of many in the Indian Independence Movement, including Mahatma Gandhi, that workers had as much of a right to participate in management of firms as shareholders or other property owners. Article 43A of the Constitution, inserted by the Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India in 1976, created a right to codetermination by requiring the state to legislate to "secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings". However, like other rights in Part IV, this article is not directly enforceable but instead creates a duty upon state organs to implement its principles through legislation (and potentially through court cases). In 1978 the Sachar Report recommended legislation for inclusion of workers on boards, however this had not yet been implemented.
The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 section 3 created a right of participation in joint work councils to "provide measures for securing amity and good relations between the employer and workmen and, to that end to comment upon matters of their common interest or concern and endeavour to compose any material difference of opinion in respect of such matters". However, trade unions had not taken up these options on a large scale. In "National Textile Workers Union v Ramakrishnan" the Supreme Court, Bhagwati J giving the leading judgment, held that employees had a right to be heard in a winding up petition of a company because their interests were directly affected and their standing was not excluded by the wording of the Companies Act 1956 section 398.
Collective action.
The Industrial Disputes Act 1947 regulates how employers may address industrial disputes such as lockouts, layoffs, retrenchment etc. It controls the lawful processes for reconciliation, adjudication of labour disputes.
According to fundamental rules (FR 17A) of the civil service of India, a period of unauthorised absence- (i) in the case of employees working in industrial establishments, during a strike which has been declared illegal under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, or any other law for the time being in force; (ii) in the case of other employees as a result of action in combination or in concerted manner,such as during a strike, without any authority from, or valid reason to the satisfaction of the competent authority; shall be deemed to cause an interruption or break in the service of the employee, unless otherwise decided by the competent authority for the purpose of leave travel concession,quasi-permanency and eligibility for appearing in departmental examinations, for which a minimum period of continuous service is required.
Equality.
Article 14 states everyone should be equal before the law, article 15 specifically says the state should not discriminate against citizens, and article 16 extends a right of "equality of opportunity" for employment or appointment under the state. Article 23 prohibits all trafficking and forced labour, while article 24 prohibits child labour under 14 years old in a factory, mine or "any other hazardous employment".
Sex discrimination.
Article 39(d) of the Constitution provides that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work. In the Equal Remuneration Act 1976 implemented this principle in legislation.
Vulnerable groups.
Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976, abolishes bonded labour, but estimates suggest that between 2 million and 5 million workers still remain in debt bondage in India.
Child labour in India is prohibited by the Constitution, article 24, in factories, mines and hazardous employment, and that under article 21 the state should provide free and compulsory education up to a child is aged 14. However in practice, the laws are not enforced. 
Dismissal regulation.
Some of India's most controversial labour laws concern the procedures for dismissal contained in the Industrial Disputes Act 1947. A workmen who has been employed for over a year can only be dismissed if permission is sought from and granted by the appropriate government office. Additionally, before dismissal, valid reasons must be given, and there is a wait of at least two months for government permission, before a lawful termination can take effect. Redundancy pay must be given, set at 15 days' average pay for each complete year of continuous service. An employee who has worked for 4 years in addition to various notices and due process, must be paid a minimum of the employee's wage equivalent to 60 days before retrenchment, if the government grants the employer a permission to layoff.
A permanent worker can be terminated only for proven misconduct or for habitual absence. The Industrial Disputes Act (1947) requires companies employing more than 100 workers to seek government approval before they can fire employees or close down. In practice, permissions for firing employees are seldom granted. Indian laws require a company to get permission for dismissing workers with plant closing, even if it is necessary for economic reasons. The government may grant or deny permission for closing, even if the company is losing money on the operation.
The dismissed worker has a right to appeal, even if the government has granted the dismissal application. Indian labour regulations provide for a number of appeal and adjudicating authorities – conciliation officers, conciliation boards, courts of inquiry, labour courts, industrial tribunals and the national industrial tribunal – under the Industrial Disputes Act. These involve complex procedures. Beyond these labour appeal and adjucating procedures, the case can proceed to respective State High Court or finally the Supreme Court of India.
Unemployment.
The Industries (Regulation and Development) Act 1951 declared that manufacturing industries under its First Schedule were under common central government regulations in addition to whatever laws state government enact. It reserved over 600 products that can only be manufactured in small scale enterprises, thereby regulating who can enter in these businesses, and above all placing a limit on the number of employees per company for the listed products. The list included all key technology and industrial products in the early 1950s, including products ranging from certain iron and steel products, fuel derivatives, motors, certain machinery, machine tools, to ceramics and scientific equipment.
State laws.
Each state in India may have special labour regulations in certain circumstances.
Gujarat.
In 2004 the State of Gujarat amended the Industrial Disputes Act to allow greater labour market flexibility in the Special Export Zones of Gujarat. The law allows companies within SEZs to lay off redundant workers, without seeking the permission of the government, by giving a formal notice and severance pay.
West Bengal.
The West Bengal government revised its labor laws making it virtually impossible to shut down a loss-making factory. The West Bengal law applies to all companies within the state that employ 50 or more employees.
International comparison of Indian labour laws.
The table below contrasts the labour laws in India to those in China and United States, as of 2011.
Criticisms and reforms.
Many observers have argued that India's labour laws should be reformed.
According to a World Bank report in 2008, heavy reform would be desirable. The executive summary stated,
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that new labour laws are needed.
In Uttam Nakate case, the Bombay High Court held that dismissing an employee for repeated sleeping on the factory floor was illegal - a decision which was overturned by the Supreme Court of India. Moreover, it took two decades to complete the legal process. In 2008, the World Bank criticised the complexity, lack of modernisation and flexibility in Indian regulations.

Jim Clancy (baseball)

James Clancy (born December 18, 1955 in Chicago, Illinois) is a former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Toronto Blue Jays (1977–88), Houston Astros (1989–91) and Atlanta Braves (1991). He batted and threw right-handed.
Texas Rangers.
Clancy attended St. Rita of Cascia High School on the south side of Chicago and was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the fourth round of the 1974 MLB Draft. Clancy played rookie level baseball with the Rangers Gulf Coast League team, where he had a record of 3-3 with a 2.72 ERA in nine starts.
The Rangers moved Clancy up to the Anderson Rangers of the Western Carolinas League for the 1975 season, however, despite a respectable ERA of 3.83 in 23 starts, Clancy had a poor 6-13 record. Texas moved Clancy up to the San Antonio Brewers of the Texas League in 1976, however, he had a rough season, posting a record of 6-8 with a 6.41 in 23 starts. He was left unprotected in the 1976 MLB Expansion Draft, and was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays with the sixth pick.
Toronto Blue Jays.
Clancy began his Blue Jays career playing with the Cleveland Indians AA affiliate, the Jersey City Indians of the Eastern League. Despite having a poor season with the team, where he had a 5-13 record and 4.88 ERA in 20 starts, the Blue Jays called him up to the Major League level. Clancy made his MLB debut on July 26, 1977, against the Texas Rangers at Exhibition Stadium. Clancy started the game, however, he lasted only two innings, allowing five runs as the Rangers routed Toronto 14-0. Clancy earned his first major league victory in his next start, pitching a complete game, allowing seven hits and one earned run as Toronto defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 3-2. Clancy would finish the year with a 4-9 record with a 5.05 ERA.
In 1978, Clancy spent his first full season with the Blue Jays, earning a 10-12 record with a 4.09 ERA in 31 games. He had an injury plagued season in 1979, where he had a 2-7 record and a 5.51 ERA in 12 games.
Clancy had a very solid season in 1980, as he had a 13-16 record with a 3.30 ERA and 15 complete games, before struggling in the 1981 season, as Clancy had a 6-12 record with a 4.90 ERA.
In 1982, Clancy posted his first winning season, as he had a 16-14 record, starting a league high 40 games, and appearing in the 1982 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, where he pitched a perfect fourth inning. 
Clancy had another very solid season in 1983, compiling a record of 15-11 with a 3.91 ERA, as the Blue Jays had their first ever winning season.
Clancy struggled in 1984, as he had a losing record for the first time in three seasons, with a 13-15 record, and a 4.64 ERA in a league high 36 starts. He led the league in earned runs allowed with 125. The 1985 season would be injury plagued, however, Clancy pitched effectively, earning a 9-6 record and a 3.78 ERA as Toronto made the post-season for the first time in team history. The injured Clancy pitched in only one inning in the 1985 ALCS as Toronto lost to the Kansas City Royals in seven games.
He had a disappointing 1986 season, as Clancy posted a 14-14 record with a 3.94 ERA, followed by a strong year in 1987, in which he had a 15-11 record and a 3.54 ERA as the Blue Jays failed to qualify for the playoffs in both years. Clancy spent his final season with Toronto in 1988, where he struggled with a record of 11-13 and a 4.49 ERA, as the Jays once again missed the playoffs.
Houston Astros.
Clancy became a free agent after the 1988 season, and signed a contract with the Houston Astros. He made his Astros debut on April 8, 1989, pitching 8.1 innings and allowing two runs in a 6-2 win over the San Diego Padres at The Astrodome. He would struggle as the season went along, sporting a record of 7-14 with a 5.08 ERA as the Astros finished in third place in the National League West.
Clancy split time between starting and working out of the bullpen in 1990, where he struggled with a 2-8 record and a 6.51 ERA, and had a stint with the Tucson Toros, the Astros AAA affiliate in the Pacific Coast League. In 1991, Clancy spent the season working out of the bullpen, and despite a 0-3 record, he was effective, as he had a 2.78 ERA in 30 games and earned five saves. On July 31, 1991, Clancy was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Matt Turner.
Atlanta Braves.
Clancy appeared in 24 games with the Atlanta Braves, all out of the bullpen, as he posted a 3-2 record with a 5.71 ERA, helping Atlanta win the National League West division. In the 1991 NLCS, Clancy made only one appearance, getting the only batter out that he faced as the Braves defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates to earn a spot in the World Series. Clancy pitched in three games during the 1991 World Series, and earned his first ever post-season victory in the third game of the series as Atlanta defeated the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in twelve innings. Clancy finished the series with a 1-0 record with a 4.15 ERA, but the Twins won the series in seven games.
Clancy once again became a free agent after the season, and signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs, but he retired during spring training in 1992.

Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)

Donny & Marie is an American variety show which aired on ABC from January 1976 to January 1979. The show stars brother and sister pop duo Donny Osmond and Marie Osmond. Donny had first become popular singing in a music group with his brothers, The Osmonds, and Marie was one of the youngest singers to reach #1 on the "Billboard" Country Music charts (with "Paper Roses", in 1973).
The siblings were offered a weekly show by ABC-TV President Fred Silverman after he saw the duo co-host a week on "The Mike Douglas Show" which followed their series of popular remakes of oldies, such as "I'm Leaving It (All) Up To You", "Morning Side Of The Mountain", "Deep Purple" and "Make The World Go Away". Donny and Marie (18 and 16 years old, respectively, when the program premiered) were the youngest entertainers in TV history to host their own variety show. A year later, The Keane Brothers would break this record.
Overview.
"Donny & Marie" was a Friday night show that consisted mainly of an ice skating number intro, comedy skits, followed by songs performed by the duo. The most famous song performed on the show was "I'm A Little Bit Country, I'm a Little Bit Rock and Roll", which formed the basis of a weekly segment (the "Concert Spot") in which Marie ("a little bit country") would trade off singing a country music song with Donny ("I'm a little bit rock and roll") singing a rock and roll song. Each episode concluded with a musical finale and a cascade of balloons from the ceiling, matched to the colors of the sets and costumes. Donny and Marie would then sing their trademark closing song which was written by Alan Osmond, "May Tomorrow Be a Perfect Day". Occasionally, the show would feature roughly 15-minute musical adaptations of famous feature films, such as "" and "The Wizard of Oz", with a mix of original cast members and celebrity guest stars (Paul Lynde was a regular in these sketches).
The show was shown in the UK on Sunday afternoon on BBC1, where it was always billed as "The Osmonds".
The show's popularity declined after it was revealed that teen heartthrob Donny was dating (and eventually married) fellow Utahn Debbie Glenn, therefore taking him 'off the market' of eligible bachelors. According to an edition of the VH1 series "Behind the Music", many female viewers started to tune out at this point. The series also underwent a format change in the final season, eliminating segments such as the ice skaters and country/rock-n-roll segments in favor of more concert-style disco numbers. The show was also retitled "The Osmond Family Show" near the end, as the program increasingly featured members of Donny and Marie's family. The variety show genre as a whole, at the time, was in steep decline, and the success of "Donny & Marie" was somewhat of an aberration compared to the trends of television in the late 1970s (two of the last successful variety shows, "The Sonny & Cher Show" and "The Carol Burnett Show", both left the air in 1977 and 1978 respectively).
The 1980–1981 TV season featured Marie with a Bob Mackie fashion make-over and starring in her own solo variety series on NBC called "Marie", which was also produced at Silverman's behest and attempted to follow a similar format. It lasted one season.
Donny and Marie joined together again in 1998 to co-host "Donny & Marie" (also known as "The Donny and Marie Hour" and "The Donny and Marie Show"), a talk show that ran for two seasons.
Production notes.
Originally, the show was created by Sid & Marty Krofft and videotaped in Los Angeles at KTLA Studios, but creative control of the show was given to the Osmonds after a long battle, and "Donny & Marie" was moved to the Osmond Studios in Orem, Utah in November 1977.

Artizans, Labourers &amp; General Dwellings Company

The Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) was a nineteenth-century philanthropic model dwellings company, which later became a multinational property developer before being absorbed into Sun Life.
Origins.
The Artizans Company was established in 1867 by William Austin, an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1d per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. 
The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes "in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875.
The company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.
London estates.
The Artizans Company is best known for its four large housing estates built on the then-outskirts of London. The first was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on of land to the west of London, adjacent to the railway line out of Euston (Queen's Park station opened 1879), purchased from All Souls College, Oxford. A third London estate was planned at Cann Hall, and a site of was purchased. 
However, the Queen's Park project suffered serious mismanagement and fraud and in 1877 the company secretary William Swindlehurst and two others were found guilty of defrauding £9,312 (approximately £ today) from the project. The company was forced to raise rents and tenants were no longer permitted to buy their houses; by 1880 the company's finances had recovered sufficiently to allow further expansion. A third estate, Noel Park, was built near Wood Green north of London between 1883 and 1929, followed by a fourth in Streatham at Leigham Court.
The slow take-up of available homes in Noel Park, particularly due to the Great Eastern Railway's refusal to offer third-class rail fares from the nearby Noel Park and Wood Green station, led the Company to begin building centrally located tenement blocks more similar to those of other model dwellings companies. Between 1885 and 1892, the Artizans Company built 1,467 dwellings in Central London and the West End, the first being the Portman Buildings in Lisson Grove, Marylebone, opened in 1888.
Diversification and divestment.
In 1952, the Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company was renamed the Artizans and General Properties Company Ltd. The combination of a taxation system biased against private property developments and legal restrictions on raising rents made the company's traditional model unprofitable, and it began to divest itself of its original low-rent developments and instead to sell vacant houses on the estates and to reinvest in non low-rent housing and commercial property, especially in the United States and Canada where depreciation before tax was permitted, and in Australia, Belgium and France. In 1966, ownership of the four original London estates (Shaftesbury Park, Queen's Park, Noel Park and Leigham Court) was transferred to the respective local authorities, leaving 377 homes at Pinnerwood Park in Pinner as the last residential estate in Greater London owned by the company.
In 1976, the Artizans Company, by then renamed Artagen Properties Ltd, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life, and on, 3 February 1981, the company was renamed Sun Life Properties Ltd.

<doc id="21624273" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21624273" title="Kingdom of Kush">
Kingdom of Kush

The Kingdom of Kush or Kush was an ancient African kingdom situated on the confluences of the Blue Nile, White Nile and River Atbara in what is now the Republic of Sudan.
Established after the Bronze Age collapse and the disintegration of the New Kingdom of Egypt, it was centered at Napata in its early phase. After king Kashta ("the Kushite") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the Kushite kings ruled as Pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt for a century, until they were expelled by Psamtik I in 656 BC.
During Classical Antiquity, the Kushite imperial capital was at Meroe. In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as Ethiopia. The Kushite kingdom with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion.
By the 1st century AD, the Kushite capital had been captured by the Beja Dynasty, who tried to revive the empire. The Kushite capital was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the Kingdom of Axum.
Name.
The native name of the Kingdom was probably "Kaš", recorded in Egyptian as "".
"Kash" (or Kush) is also an ethnic term for the native population who initiated the kingdom of Kush. The term is also displayed in the names of Kushite persons, such as King Kashta. Geographically, Kush referred to the region south of the first cataract in general. Kush also was the home of the rulers of the 25th dynasty.
The name "Kush" since at least the time of Josephus has been connected with the biblical character Cush, in the Hebrew Bible (Hebrew: כוש), son of Ham (Genesis 10:6). Ham had four sons named: Cush, Put, Canaan and Mizraim (Hebrew name for Egypt). However, following Friedrich Delitzsch ("Wo lag das Paradies?" 1881), modern scholars have often suggested that certain uses of the name "Cush" in the Bible might refer instead to the Kassites of the Zagros Mountains region (within modern Iran).
Origins.
Mentuhotep II (21st century BC founder of the Middle Kingdom) is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 29th and 31st years of his reign. This is the earliest Egyptian reference to "Kush"; the Nubian region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom.
During the New Kingdom of Egypt, Nubia ("Kush") was an Egyptian colony, from the 16th century BC governed by an Egyptian Viceroy of Kush. With the disintegration of the New Kingdom around 1070 BC, "Kush" became an independent kingdom centered at Napata in modern central Sudan.
The Kushites buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. Archaeologists refer to these practices as the "Pan-grave culture". This was given its name due to the way in which the remains are buried. They would dig a pit and put stones around them in a circle. Kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids, and shared some of the same gods worshiped in Egypt, especially Ammon and Isis. With the worshiping of these gods the Kushites began to take some of the names of the gods as their throne names.
The Kush rulers were regarded as guardians of the state religion and were responsible for maintaining the houses of the gods. Some scholars believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state. Northern Kush seemed to be more productive and wealthier than the Southern area.
Conquest of Egypt (25th Dynasty).
In 945 BC, Sheshonq I and Libyan princes took control of the Ancient Egyptian delta and founded the so-called Libyan or Bubastite dynasty, which would rule for some 200 years. Sheshonq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. In 711, King Sheshonq made Memphis his northern capital. However, Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in Leontopolis and Kushites threatened from the south. Around 727 BC, the Kushite king Piye invaded Egypt, seized control of Thebes and eventually the Delta. His dynasty, the Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt, continued until about 653 BC. Piye attempted to regain a foothold in the Near East, but was defeated by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser V in the 720's BC. The 25th dynasty was based at Napata, in Nubia, which is now The Sudan. Alara is universally regarded as the founder of the 25th Kushite dynasty by his successors.
The power of the 25th Dynasty reached a climax under the pharaohs Piye and Taharqa. The Nile valley empire was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. The 25th dynasty ushered in a renaissance period for Ancient Egypt. Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their glorious Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms. Pharaohs, such as Taharqa, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, Jebel Barkal, etc. It was during the 25th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom.
Taharqa was the son of Piye and the first seventeen years of his reign were very prosperous for Kush. During this period Writing was introduced to Kush (Nubia), in the form of the Egyptian influenced Meroitic script circa 700–600 BC, although it appears to have been wholly confined to the Royal Court and Major Temples. Egypt's international prestige declined considerably towards the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its Semitic allies in the Southern Levant had fallen to the Assyrian Empire. The Semitic Assyrians, from the 10th century BC onwards, had expanded from their northern Mesopotamian homeland, and conquered a vast empire, including the whole of the Near East, and much of Asia Minor, the eastern Mediterranean, the Caucasus and ancient Iran. By 700 BC war between the two Empires became inevitable. Taharqa enjoyed some initial success in his attempts to regain influence in the Near East. He aided King Hezekiah from attack by Sennacherib and the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:9;Isaiah 37:9), however disease among the Assyrian army appears to have been the main cause of failure to take the Jerusalem. Eventually, the Assyrian King Sennacherib defeated and drove the Nubians and Egyptians from the region. Between 674 and 671 BC the Assyrians began their invasion of Egypt under King Esarhaddon, the successor of Sennacherib. The Assyrians conquered this vast territory with surprising speed. Taharqa was driven from power by Esarhaddon, and fled to his Nubian homeland. Esarhaddon describes "installing local kings and governors" and "All Ethiopians I deported from Egypt, leaving not one to do homage to me". However, the native Egyptian vassal rulers installed by Esarhaddon were unable to retain control for long. Two years later, Taharqa returned from Nubia and seized control of a section of Egypt as far north as Memphis. Esarhaddon prepared to return to Egypt and once more eject Taharqa, however he fell ill and died in his capital Nineveh, before he left Assyria. His successor, Ashurbanipal, sent a "Turtanu" (general) with a small army which ejected Taharqa from Egypt, and he was forced to flee back to Nubia, where he died two years later. His successor, Tanutamun, attempted to regain Egypt. He successfully defeated Necho, the subject ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians, who had a military presence in the north, then sent a large army southwards. Tantamani was heavily routed and the Assyrian army sacked Thebes to such an extent it never truly recovered. Tantamani managed to escape back to Nubia, but never threatened the Assyrian Empire again. A native ruler, Psammetichus I, was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal.
Why the Kushites chose to enter Egypt at this crucial point of foreign domination is subject to debate. Archaeologist Timothy Kendall offers his own hypotheses, connecting it to a claim of legitimacy associated with Gebel Barkal. Kendall cites the stele of Pharaoh Piye, which states that "Amun of Napata granted me to be ruler of every foreign country," and "Amun in Thebes granted me to be ruler of the Black Land (Kmt)". Noteworthy is that according to Kendall, "foreign lands" in this regard seems to include Lower Egypt while Kmt seems to refer to a united Upper Egypt and Nubia.
Move to Meroë.
Aspelta moved the capital to Meroë, considerably farther south than Napata, possibly in 591 BC. It is also possible that Meroë had always been the Kushite capital.
Historians believe that the Kushite rulers may have chosen Meroë as their home because, unlike Napata, the region around Meroë had enough woodlands to provide fuel for iron working. In addition, Kush was no longer dependent on the Nile to trade with the outside world; they could instead transport goods from Meroë to the Red Sea coast, where Greek merchants were now traveling extensively.
The Kushites used the animal-driven water wheel to increase productivity and create a surplus, particularly during the Napatan-Meroitic Kingdom.
In about 300 BC the move to Meroë was made more complete when the monarchs began to be buried there, instead of at Napata. One theory is that this represents the monarchs breaking away from the power of the priests at Napata. According to Diodorus Siculus, a Kushite king, "Ergamenes", defied the priests and had them slaughtered. This story may refer to the first ruler to be buried at Meroë with a similar name such as Arqamani, who ruled many years after the royal cemetery was opened at Meroë. During this same period, Kushite authority may have extended some 1,500 km along the Nile River valley from the Egyptian frontier in the north to areas far south of modern Khartoum and probably also substantial territories to the east and west.
Kushite civilization continued for several centuries. In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars. It is not as yet possible to connect the Meroitic language with other known languages.
Strabo describes a war with the Romans in the 1st century BC. After the initial victories of Kandake (or "Candace") Amanirenas against Roman Egypt, the Kushites were defeated and Napata sacked. Remarkably, the destruction of the capital of Napata was not a crippling blow to the Kushites and did not frighten Candace enough to prevent her from again engaging in combat with the Roman military. Indeed, it seems that Petronius's attack might have had a revitalizing influence on the kingdom. Just three years later, in 22 BC, a large Kushite force moved northward with intention of attacking Qasr Ibrim. Alerted to the advance, Petronius again marched south and managed to reach Qasr Ibrim and bolster its defences before the invading Kushites arrived. Although the ancient sources give no description of the ensuing battle, we know that at some point the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius. By the end of the second campaign, however, Petronius was in no mood to deal further with the Kushites. The Kushites succeeded in negotiating a peace treaty on favourable terms and trade between the two nations increased. Some historians like Theodore Mommsen wrote that during Augustus times Nubia was a possible "client state" of the Roman Empire.
It is possible that the Roman emperor Nero planned another attempt to conquer Kush before his death in 68 AD. Kush began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century AD, sapped by the war with the Roman province of Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries.
Christianity began to gain over the old phaoronic religion and by the mid-sixth century AD the Kingdom of Kush was dissolved.
Kush and Egyptology.
On account of the Kingdom of Kush's proximity to Ancient Egypt — the first cataract at Elephantine usually being considered the traditional border between the two polities — and because the 25th dynasty ruled over both states in the 8th century BC, from the Rift Valley to the Taurus mountains, historians have closely associated the study of Kush with Egyptology, in keeping with the general assumption that the complex sociopolitical development of Egypt's neighbors can be understood in terms of Egyptian models. As a result, the political structure and organization of Kush as an independent ancient state has not received as thorough attention from scholars, and there remains much ambiguity especially surrounding the earliest periods of the state. Edwards has suggested that study of the region could benefit from increased recognition of Kush as a state in its own right, with distinct cultural conditions, rather than merely as a secondary state on the periphery of Egypt.

Marius Nygaard Smith-Petersen

Marius Nygaard Smith-Petersen ( November 14, 1886 – May 1953) was Norwegian-born American physician and orthopaedic surgeon.
Background.
Marius Nygaard Smith-Petersen was born 14 Nov. 1886 in the coastal town of Grimstad, Aust-Agder County, Norway. He died 16 June 1953 of a heart disorder at age 65 in Boston Massachusetts. He was the son of Morten Smith-Petersen and Kaia Jensine Ursin. The Smith-Petersens were a prominent and influential Norwegian family for many generations. His grandfather Morten Smith-Petersen was a member of Stortinget (Parliament), he owned a shipbuilding company where he built and operated a great fleet of merchant sailing vessels from his shipyard known as Hasseldalen in Grimstad Norway. His paternal grandmother was Katrinka von der Lippe, daughter of Jacob Von der Lippe a member of Parliament and the Bishop of Christianssand. His father, Morten was considered a brilliant young lawyer with great promise in 1888 when he died suddenly of pneumonia, when Marius was two years old. His mother, Kaia was a talented violinist, she was playing trios with her father Fredrik Ursin and composer, pianist Edvard Grieg at the age of twelve. In 1903 at the age of sixteen, Marius and his mother immigrated to the U.S. and settled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There he was graduated from West Side High School in 1906. He then attended the University of Chicago for one year, then transferred and graduated from the University of Wisconsin, receiving a B.S. in 1910. He worked as a laboratory assistant to the Nobel Prize winner (1944) physiologist, Dr. Joseph Erlanger while attending the Medical School at the University of Wisconsin. Marius Smith-Petersen then transferred to Harvard Medical School earning his degree in 1914. His general surgical internship was served at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston MA under the pioneering neurosurgeon, Harvey Williams Cushing, M.D. The knowledge, skills and techniques he acquired from this association had a profound influence on his surgical career. He served in France during WWI with the First Harvard Medical Unit at the American Ambulance Hospital in Paris. His orthopaedic foundation was laid under Dr. E. G. Brackett at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr Smith-Petersen often called Mads by his friends went into private practice in Boston in 1923. He served as Assistant Instructor in Orthopaedic Surgery at Harvard Medical School from 1920-1930, as Instructor in Orthopaedic Surgery at Harvard Medical School from 1930–1946, as Clinical Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at Harvard Medical School from 1935-1946 and as Chief of Orthopaedic Srevice at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1929-1946 and as consultant to The Surgeon General from 1942-1945. He was internationally known for the development of the Smith-Petersen nail and hip nailing techniques and for hip-mold arthoplasty. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav by the King of Norway . He was a brilliant surgeon and a gifted professor. He married Hilda Whitney Dickinson daughter of Charles P. Dickinson and Susan Cushing of Lunenburg, Massachusetts.
Career.
From 1923 until his death in 1953 he carried on an active orthopedic surgery practice while successively serving as Instructor, Assistant Clinical Professor, and Clinical Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at Harvard. In 1929 he was appointed Chief of Orthopaedic Surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1925, Smith-Petersen introduced the three-flanged steel nail for insertion across the fracture site in hip fractures, an innovation that considerably improved recovery and mortality rates from hip fractures.
In May 1953 he performed successful surgery on entertainer Arthur Godfrey, who had been in pain for over 20 years after an auto accident. Smith-Petersen died just days after his surgery on Godfrey.

The Gateway (student newspaper)

"The Gateway" newspaper is a fortnightly business and careers newspaper, distributed at fifteen universities in the United Kingdom. First published at Oxford University in October 2007, "The Gateway" is often dubbed "the student FT" due to being printed on the same light salmon paper as the Financial Times. Published by Career Gateways Limited, "The Gateway" specialises in making the world of business and finance accessible to students keen to pursue a career in the city.
"The Gateway" website was most recently relaunched in October 2011. It is updated daily with articles aimed at improving readers commercial awareness and providing advice on graduate jobs in business and finance.
History.
"The Gateway" was conceived by three Oxford University students, Mawuli Ladzekpo (Exeter College), Max Lewis (Pembroke College) and Chris Wilkinson (Lincoln College) in the summer of 2007. The trio aimed to fill the apparent niche for a publication that combined business and financial news with independent careers advice, and sought to take advantage of the growing graduate recruitment marketing industry that centered around Oxbridge. The first issue of "The Gateway" was released on October 8th 2007 with a circulation of 6,000 at Oxford University.
In November of 2007, "The Gateway" received commercial backing when the London based boutique recruitment consultancy, OxbridgeGroup, bought a stake in Career Gateways Limited. This injection of capital allowed for an increased distribution of "The Gateway" to include an additional fourteen universities in the United Kingdom. It also resulted in "The Gateway" shedding its student workforce recruited by its founders, to be replaced with a team of full-time staff based at "The Gateway"'s headquarters in the London Docklands. The company remained managed, in part, by its student founders.
The Gateway is currently published independently from headquarters in central London.
Content.
"The Gateway" contains articles on a range of issues relevant to university students with an interest in business and finance. Content typically originates from a combination the publication's staff writers, industry experts, and student contributors. 
Readership.
Readership of "The Gateway" is independently verified and published annually in "The UK Graduate Careers Survey", produced by High Fliers Research in association with the Times.
Distribution universities.
"The Gateway" is distributed at fifteen universities in the United Kingdom, based loosely on the Russell Group.

Mr. Monk Goes to the Firehouse

Mr. Monk Goes to the Firehouse (2006) is a mystery novel by Lee Goldberg, based on the popular TV series "Monk".
Plot introduction.
Adrian Monk temporarily moves in with his reluctant assistant, Natalie Teeger, while his home is being fumigated. Following this, her teenage daughter Julie "hires" him to investigate the death of Sparky, a popular firehouse guard dog who was struck with an axe on the same night that a suspicious house inferno was occupying its owners. Meanwhile, Natalie begins dating the animal's chief guardian, hunky fireman Joseph Cochran.
Plot synopsis.
Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive modern-day Sherlock Holmes, is forced to move in with his assistant Natalie Teeger, who is the narrator of the novel, while his apartment is being fumigated. After laying down certain laws (namely, turning away the moving men bringing Monk’s refrigerator and bed into her house) Natalie finds her daughter Julie crying in her room. Julie tells her that Sparky, a firehouse dalmatian who visited her school during Fire Safety Week, was found murdered the previous night. Monk can’t bear to see Julie cry, and promises to check into the matter. 
Monk and Natalie head down to Fire Station #28 in North Beach, Sparky's firehouse, to speak with Captain Mantooth, the brigade commander of the engine company in question. Monk has a boyish fascination with firefighting – that is, with the rules requiring everything in the firehouse to be spotlessly clean and in perfect order. While he is lovingly polishing the already shining ladder truck, Natalie questions Mantooth, who tells her that Sparky belonged to one of their best men, Joseph 'Joe' Cochran, and always slept in the firehouse while Joe was on duty.
Mantooth tells them about the circumstances of that Friday night. They had been called away to a multiple alarm house fire about four blocks away around 10:00 PM in which an old woman was killed, having fallen asleep while smoking a cigarette in front of her television set. When they came back, they found Sparky dead on the floor. He'd been bludgeoned with a pick axe. Monk examines the crime scene, and he explains what he believe happened: the intruder walked into the firehouse through the open garage doors, probably looking for something to steal (although oddly, for a burglary, nothing seems to be missing), and grabbed a pickaxe off the rack when Sparky ran at him. Since the killer didn’t bring the weapon, Monk guesses that the attack was probably spur-of-the-moment. The only question is who, or why would someone kill a firehouse dog, and what was it the killer might have been looking for? When Monk asks Mantooth if anything was missing or disturbed when they got back, Mantooth says the only thing he noticed were two towels missing; he doesn’t think it’s important, but Monk is impressed to meet someone else who would notice that kind of detail.
Monk and Natalie walk from the firehouse the five blocks to the scene of the previous night's fire, intending to look for Joe Cochran. However, they instead have a chance run-in with Captain Stottlemeyer. He explains to them that he is here because the police have to treat the house as a crime scene until the arson investigator makes a decision. Stottlemeyer and the arson investigator believe that the death was an accident: Esther Stoval, the victim, was a chain smoker. They believe that she was smoking a cigarette, which fell onto a pile of newspapers, igniting them. The fire spread from the newspapers to the rest of the room, and then to the rest of the house. However, Monk finds evidence that suggests that Esther was actually murdered: from the victim's position on the couch, she couldn't see the TV, and was looking at an empty chair, making it obvious that she was talking to someone else. Furthermore, if she was watching TV when she died, then why is the remote on the other end of the coffee table from where her head was? The conclusion is that someone killed Esther, then set her house on fire to destroy the evidence.
Later that day, Monk and Natalie find Joe Cochran feeding the neighborhood’s stray cats while the investigations wrap up. Monk refuses to approach the cats (due to allergies), so Natalie goes to talk with Joe, and sparks immediately fly – Joe is not only ruggedly handsome, but big-hearted and courteous. When Natalie explains why they are there, Joe, a little choked up, says that everyone loved Sparky, and the only person with a motive he can think of would be Gregorio Dumas, a stuck-up dog breeder who lives across the street from the firehouse. Recently, Gregorio Dumas threatened the fire company with a lawsuit after Sparky impregnated his prize show poodle Letitia. 
Monk and Natalie talk to Dumas, who cuts a ludicrous figure with his palatial accommodations for his poodle, and his descriptions of Sparky as a common mutt. When Monk asks where he was the previous night, Dumas says he was at home on Friday night, watching the firehouse to make sure Sparky didn’t try anything again. While watching, he saw a lone firefighter come out of the firehouse. When Natalie brings this up on a date with Joe later, Joe says that this is impossible: all of the on-duty firemen were at Esther Stoval's house that night and they never sent anyone back for supplies. Monk figures that perhaps Dumas saw the killer. In questioning Dumas, Monk also notices a strange detail: Dumas is so overprotective of his poodle that he keeps her in a locked kennel surrounded by barbed wire – so how could Sparky have impregnated her? 
Before Monk can delve further on the firehouse dog case, he and Natalie are called back to the police station, where Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Disher have received the autopsy report on Esther Stoval. Randy notes that there were no traces of smoke or soot particles in Esther's lungs or nasal passages, confirming Monk's suspicion that she was dead before the fire was started. The autopsy says that Esther was suffocated with a pillow. They have what Stottlemeyer calls a perfect murder: by then burning down the house, the killer was able to destroy all forensic evidence that would have otherwise existed, including usable fingerprints and DNA. On top of all that, there is not a single witness to the crime. 
Monk and Natalie ask around the neighborhood and they are dismayed to find that all of Esther’s neighbors despised her: she was a stereotypical “mean old lady,” who spied on the neighbors, complained loudly about their habits, and kept everyone up all night with the mewling of her innumerable cats. Worse, she was the lone holdout against a development plan by Lucas Breen, a local real estate tycoon, to demolish the houses on Esther's side of the street, and build an upscale condominium block. Now that she’s dead, the other residents are delighted to take their buyout from Breen and vacate the neighborhood. 
Neighbors on both sides of Esther's street show similar stories - one of her next-door neighbors, who works at a local think tank, claims he had to research every new cat that Esther bought, and also mentions that Esther bought a type of cat known as a Turkish Van a few days before she was killed. He also notes that her house was like an enormous litterbox (as the dander would blow when it was windy out). When Monk and Natalie talk to a neighbor who lived across the street from Esther, the neighbor mentions an incident where Esther ratted him out to the cable company for hijacking their signal with an illegal converter box to watch a baseball game. He notes that he also sells antique cars to make some money (as he is unemployed), and when Esther saw people buying restored antique vehicles from him, she filed a complaint with the city clerk, who fined him for operating a business out of his house without first getting a license. 
Joe asks Natalie out on a date, and she accepts gladly; while picking her up, Joe also wins over Julie by giving her Sparky’s firehouse badge and thanking her for caring enough about his dog to hire Monk. 
The next day, Monk, Natalie, and Stottlemeyer interview Lucas Breen, who is both rich and influential (he holds a seat on the police commission), and CEO of the Breen Development Corporation. Breen admits he didn’t have a motive to kill Esther Stoval. In fact, for the record, if push ever came to shove, he could've always rewritten the zoning regulations on the block to evict her, or, if the worst came to happen, he could build his condo project "around" her house (Breen confides that it was only thanks to creativity that he was able to advance to the position he is currently at in the real estate industry). When Monk asks Breen for an alibi, Breen claims he was at a fundraiser at the Excelsior Tower Hote downtownl with his wife, the mayor, the governor and the governor's wife, and at least 500 other people. Leaving Breen's office, Stottlemeyer is exasperated that Monk had been needling Breen throughout the interview, and Monk says that he now believes Breen killed Esther Stoval.
When Monk arrives down in the lobby, he walks into the lobby flower shop, buys a bouquet, and presents it to Natalie and Stottlemeyer, saying that without a doubt, it proves Breen killed Esther: it's a distinctive, handmade bouquet identical to one that Monk saw in the house of Lizzie Draper, one of the neighbors who lived across the street from Esther Stoval. Monk has learned that Breen bought a flower bouquet from the shop for Lizzie just a few days before Esther was killed. He's figured that Lizzie is Breen’s mistress. Having remembered what Esther's other neighbors said about her spying habits, Monk figures that Esther had incriminating photos of Breen with Lizzie Draper, and she was blackmailing Breen, threatening to tell his wife, and he killed her to keep her quiet. 
Back at the police station, Randy confirms that Breen's alibi for that night is rock solid. When Stottlemeyer asks about the alibi, Monk dismisses it: the fundraiser was crowded enough that Breen could have slipped out, killed Esther, set the house on fire, and reappeared several hours later without anyone noticing he had gone. Moreover, Breen designed and built the Excelsior, so he would know how to slip out without being seen by the security cameras. However, the flowers aren't solid evidence, and with no witnesses who can confirm that Breen was in the house that night, plus the fact that Breen burned down the house to get rid of all traces of himself, they won't be able to easily arrest Breen, lest so much as indict him.
But there is one question: how did Breen get to Esther's house? Natalie reasons that he couldn't have driven himself there because the press would have seen him leaving, and he probably wouldn't hail a taxi cab out of fear that the driver might remember him. Monk decides that Breen walked there.
To see if it is possible, Monk and Natalie park at the hotel to recreate the timetable Breen would have had to work with. They find one service exit to a back alleyway that is blocked from view from the street by a number of dumpsters, and decide that Breen used this door to exit and put himself at a safe distance from the press. To time themselves, they take the most direct route, figuring that Breen did the same thing. As they are passing one office building, a homeless man asks for spare change, and Monk gives him several packages of wipes instead. The man is not pleased. 
After about 20 minutes walking, Monk and Natalie crest a hill and find themselves at Joe's firehouse. They decide to stop in and visit, reasoning that Breen would have had to stop around this point to catch his breath for a minute while on his way to Esther Stoval's house, even if he was on a tight schedule.
While they are at the firehouse, Natalie asks Joe some more questions about Sparky's habits, and Joe says that Sparky was allowed to run loose around the neighborhood when they were out responding to 911 calls. He doesn’t know where Sparky went while they were gone, but in the last few weeks, he always smelled like crap. Monk solves a piece of the case, and he and Natalie head across the street to confront Gregorio Dumas: it seems that Dumas has been tunneling into the basement of the firehouse, using the sewer line. He deliberately used his poodle to distract Sparky so he wouldn’t bark, while Dumas searched the basement, which historical records show is where a famous 19th-century train robber stashed his hidden treasure. Now Monk realizes why Sparky always smelled. 
Dumas admits that he was in the firehouse on the night of the murder – and that he used the two missing towels to wipe the sewage off his shoes – but swears he didn’t kill Sparky, as it would have broken his poodle’s heart. He still mentions having seen the lone fireman leaving the garage, and in a way witnessed the crime. Monk believes him, and tells Natalie that Dumas saw Breen, who was posing as a fireman.
Here's What Happened.
Breen left the Excelsior and walked to Esther Stoval's house, having decided that he would try one more time to reason with her. He walked because that was the only way he could have made it there without being noticed (he couldn't drive himself because the valet and press would have seen him leave, and he couldn't take a taxi because the driver would have recognized him). When he got to Esther's house, she threatened to expose his affair with Lizzie Draper. He panicked, and quickly killed her, and then staged an "accidental" fire. He was running back to the hotel when he realized he had left something behind which would place him at her house that night. He couldn’t take the chance that it would be destroyed in the fire or could be traced to him, but by the time he realized it, the engines from Joe's firehouse had already passed him and he couldn't go back inside. He snuck into the firehouse, but Sparky came at him and Breen was forced to use a pickaxe to defend himself. He stole a helmet and turnout coat, and when he got back to the crime scene, he slipped on the gear. He was able to then retrieve the incriminating item without any bystanders or emergency workers noticing him, and then returned the stolen gear to the firehouse before returning to the fundraiser.
As Monk and Natalie make their way back to the hotel, Monk explains to Natalie that he figured Breen had stolen a fireman's coat because when they first arrived at the firehouse, there was a coat facing the wrong way. The fire captain happens to have a system. As Natalie is asking Monk how they can prove that Breen was in Esther's house the night she was killed, she is almost mugged by a man with a knife, but she gets the better of him and Monk asks him whether he mugged anyone else in that area on the night of the fire. The mugger admits that he mugged Lucas Breen on the night in question and took Breen's wallet, and mentions that Breen reeked of smoke like he'd just fled from a fire.
Monk, Natalie, and Stottlemeyer confront Breen at his office, but he denies everything. They inform him about how they know he was mugged as he was making his way back from the fire. Stottlemeyer notes that Breen did report his stolen credit cards to his bank, but wonders why Breen didn't call the police about the mugging. Breen claims he was mugged while he was out having a cigarette, and claims that he was smoking a cigar to explain what the mugger said about how Breen reeked of smoke.
The next day, Monk quickly checks the weather patterns for that night and also examines “before” and “after” pictures of Breen at the fundraiser. He notices that in the "before" photo, Breen is wearing his monogrammed, tailor-made overcoat, but when in the "after" photo showing him leaving at midnight, the overcoat is gone. 
Monk explains what he thinks happened: according to one weather chart, it stopped raining at around 9:30 PM. Joe's fire company was dispatched at 10:00 PM. If it took 40 minutes for Breen to walk from the hotel to Esther's house, Breen's time of departure could be placed at around 9:15 PM, so it would have still been raining when he first left. As a result, he wore his overcoat to stay dry. Monk figures that when he got to Esther's house, Breen must have hung his overcoat up and tried to reason with Esther, who threatened him with her incriminating images, and this provoked Breen into suffocating her. He then staged the fire and ran out of the house. With it no longer raining, Breen must have not realized he'd left his coat behind until he'd travelled a few blocks, and was practically in front of the empty firehouse. He had to get that overcoat back, because - if it were like the rest of his wardrobe - it had monogrammed buttons with Breen's initials on them, and the buttons and scorched coat could have easily been traced back to him. He killed Sparky in self-defense while stealing a turnout coat and helmet, returned to the burning house, retrieved the overcoat, then returned the stolen firefighting gear to the firehouse. Breen thought he was home free, only he got mugged on the way back to the hotel.
Monk and Natalie go back to the firehouse. Natalie claims that they're going back to find where Breen may have ditched his overcoat, but Monk quickly figures that Natalie also wants to check on Joe, and points out the things about her behavior that he noticed (she never stopped reading past a newspaper article on a warehouse fire the night before that hospitalized two firemen, and she kept checking the clock to see if it was a good time to call). They try to figure places where the coat could have been ditched. While Natalie suspects that perhaps Breen ditched it at Lizzie Draper's house, Monk points out that that would have been very risky, and he theorizes that Breen probably disposed of the coat somewhere between the firehouse and the hotel. During their search, Randy calls Natalie to tell them that the mugger has confirmed that Breen was wearing his overcoat when he was mugged. Monk and Natalie search several dumpsters on the route, but when all of the dumpsters turn up empty, Monk sadly concludes that it must have already been collected – so the only way to find it is to root through the recently collected trash at the city dump. 
Monk and Natalie go to the garbage dump and talk to Chad Grimsley, the manager, requesting him to hold the trash from the Excelsior Hotel for a few days so they can search it. They plan to go to Stottlemeyer to get their search warrants, but are forced to meet him at a homicide investigation near Sutro Tower. Monk quickly solves the homicide Stottlemeyer is working on the spot, but Stottlemeyer informs Monk that getting a search warrant for all that garbage isn't something that a judge will be likely to issue. 
Monk and Natalie head back to the police station, where they converse with Randy. When Stottlemeyer comes back, he isn't very happy, and tells them that the chief refused to give him a search warrant, and has ordered him to stop harassing Breen with malicious accusations and start looking for other possible suspects. Stottlemeyer, however, still has faith in Monk's abilities as a detective, and as such knows that if Monk believes Breen is responsible for killing an old lady and a dog, he's probably right. So he decides to do the next-best thing he can do that will not get himself in trouble. Acting on Monk's theory that Breen stole a fireman's coat to get back into Esther's house, Stottlemeyer has Randy send a forensics team to the firehouse to recover the firefighting gear that Breen might have utilized, as he believes that there is a chance that perhaps Breen left some fingerprints or DNA behind when he returned it. Randy points out that they don't know exactly which pieces of firefighting gear Breen wore that night, but Stottlemeyer admits that it is their only shot.
The next date, Joe and several recruited off-duty firefighters pitch in to help Monk and Natalie root through the garbage, but without finding the overcoat. That night, Natalie goes on a second date with Joe, and they get even closer, though Natalie is disturbed by how nonchalantly Joe takes the dangerous aspects of his job.
Their date is interrupted, however, when Stottlemeyer calls Monk and Natalie into a new homicide. A homeless man has been found bludgeoned to death with a brick in his encampment. According to the coroner, the man had been dead for two hours when he was discovered. Stottlemeyer notes that the cops are very lucky - a patrol car happened to be passing by and the officers saw the mass commotion that coincided with the body's discovery. Monk has a sneezing fit, noting that the man seems to have slept with cats. When he asks why he is here, Stottlemeyer shows him several packets of wipes in the dead man’s pockets, and asks if they knew each other. Natalie recognizes the dead man as one of the homeless men that Monk handed wipes to while they were retracing Breen's steps. 
Monk realizes that, despite the freezing cold temperatures, the dead man has no coat, and when he ran into the man on the street, he was wearing a dirty and tattered overcoat. He immediately announces that Breen also killed the homeless man. Stottlemeyer is skeptical, noting that Monk is making Breen into a type of serial killer, but Monk thinks that Breen is just a man who has to keep killing just to get away with killing Esther Stoval. He explains where the homeless man fits in: after recovering his overcoat and returning the stolen firefighting gear to the firehouse, Breen walked back to the hotel, during which time he was mugged. Afterwards, before he returned to the hotel, Breen put his overcoat in one of the Excelsior's dumpsters (probably because it had been partially scorched in the fire, and hence was ruined; also, he would have had to explain to his wife and others how he was able to scorch his overcoat during the fundraiser). Later that night, the now-deceased homeless man picked it up. He didn't know about its origins, but when Monk, Natalie and Stottlemeyer were confronting Breen with their murder accusations, Breen saw the homeless man outside, and recognized the coat. Seeing the one piece of evidence that could send him to death row passing his building, Breen tracked the homeless man down, killed him, and then stole his overcoat.
The three race to Breen's house to try and recover the coat, but they are too late: Breen has incinerated the overcoat in his fireplace, and (while sniffling due to a bad cold) smugly informs them that they have no evidence left to connect him with any crime. 
Monk trudges back to Natalie’s house, feeling defeated. He is made more frustrated by the fact that Stottlemeyer risks losing his badge because of this case, and this is a case where Stottlemeyer got dragged into the investigation. Monk flips through his favorite book of Marmaduke cartoons, and when he spots a Marmaduke cartoon in which Marmaduke chases a cat up a tree, he realizes that they still have a chance to arrest Breen. He explains his theory to Stottlemeyer, who is willing to bet on it, even though he knows that this is risky. He points out that the chief just reprimanded him that morning for what he has done, and he risks losing his badge or possibly even demotion. Randy offers to come along, but Stottlemeyer says he won’t risk Randy’s badge along with his own. 
Stottlemeyer and Natalie confront Breen in his penthouse office, while Monk remains in the lobby. Monk calls up on a cell phone, and on cue, Natalie produces a white cat called a Turkish Van. Breen starts to sneeze, and Monk reveals his ace in the hole: Breen was sneezing explosively when they confronted him at his house. He claimed to have a cold, but Monk has just proven that he and Breen have one thing in common: they're both allergic to cats! The cat Natalie is carrying is one that Esther Stoval purchased just a few days before she was killed. Monk also remembers that he had a sneezing fit when he first met the homeless man who was later killed, and later had a similar fit when he was at the dead man's encampment. He initially thought that the man lived with cats, but there were no cat litters anywhere near the encampment. Now he realizes that cat dander collected on Breen's overcoat during the fire. Stottlemeyer reveals that they're already searching Breen's car and house they are going to match the danders they find to Esther's cats.
Breen cracks and makes a run for it, escaping the office in a private elevator. Stottlemeyer curses, knowing that if Breen manages to get out of the building he will disappear forever. However, Monk has a plan. As Breen is about to drive out of the parking garage, Monk grabs two bowls of clam chowder from the lobby restaurant and throws them at Breen’s windshield, blinding him, and causing him to lose control and crash. Breen, severely injured, and having lost several of his teeth in the crash, stumbles out of his car carrying a gun, wanting nothing more than to kill Monk before he goes to prison. Before Breen can pull the trigger, Randy suddenly appears and shoots the gun out of his hand. When Stottlemeyer and Natalie arrive downstairs, Randy tells them that he followed them because he thought they would need backup, though Stottlemeyer points out to him that he also violated a direct order.
Returning to the police station, Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher learn that the preliminary on the hairs found in both Breen's house and car have matched with Esther's cats. Stottlemeyer mentions that his review hearing has been suspended and has been replaced with a commendation event for Randy. 
Satisfied, Monk and Natalie return to the firehouse to inform the crews that they’ve caught Sparky's killer. Joe is ecstatic and wants to take Natalie out to celebrate, but Natalie says she’s come to a difficult decision: she is falling for Joe, but can’t get involved with another man in a dangerous job; she and Julie already lost Mitch, and she can’t go through that again. Joe is crestfallen, but accepts her decision. 
Julie is so grateful to Monk for finding Sparky's killer that she organizes her bedroom just as he would like it. While Monk is preparing to move back home, Stottlemeyer drops by to tell them that the Breen case has been clinched by the amount of incriminating evidence they've been able to locate. They don't only have him just with the cat dander, but forensics has found Breen's fingerprints in a firefighter's glove. 
Before Stottlemeyer leaves, Monk casually asks him to arrest Mrs. Throphamner, Natalie's elderly next door neighbor who has been babysitting Julie. He says that she murdered her husband – she’s been wearing his dentures in place of her own, and constantly planting and re-planting her roses to conceal his decaying corpse buried in her garden. To Natalie’s astonishment, the neighbor confesses. Furious that Monk would let her leave Julie in the care of a murderess, on the assumption that she wouldn’t kill anyone else, Natalie stalks off, not trusting herself near Monk for a good week.
Episode adaption.
"Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing" is the fourth episode of the fifth season of "Monk", and the 65th episode overall. It was loosely adapted from the novel "Mr. Monk Goes to the Firehouse".
This episode was listed as one of Ted Levine's favorites during the "Monk" Cast Favorites Marathon.
Plot summary.
A woman falls asleep while watching TV and a lit cigarette sets her house on fire. Minutes later, at a nearby firehouse, a firefighter is killed and Monk is blinded in a bizarre attack. Monk must use his other senses to find the killer.
Plot synopsis.
Early one afternoon at Fire Company #53 of the San Francisco Fire Department, Rusty (Art Evans), a veteran firefighter, delivers lunch to his colleagues and then criticizes one crewman who cracks a dry joke. The fire captain, Stockton (Rocky McMurray), reassures Rusty that they all admire him, but is interrupted when Monk arrives carrying a container full of smoke detectors.
Barely has Monk arrived when the station's two-tone call alarm goes off. A house is engulfed in flames just five blocks away from the firehouse. Despite Monk's protests, the crew jump onto the engine, and Monk can only watch as the fire engine speeds off, sirens wailing. 
Rusty tests Monk's smoke detectors one at a time by blowing puffs of cigarette smoke into them, and is surprised to find that Monk is overly cautious, having 30 smoke detectors for the five rooms, two hallways, and vestibule that make up his apartment.
They are interrupted when they hear a squeaking noise. Monk and Rusty look up as a man named Eddie Murdoch (Drew Powell), enters the garage. Acting like he is trying not to be noticed, Murdoch walks around the cab of the spare fire engine parked in the garage. Rusty walks around the back of the truck to confront Murdoch, who promptly grabs a shovel from the tool rack and strikes him across the head with a lethal blow. Monk hears an audible clang. When Rusty doesn't respond, he rushes over to investigate and is promptly attacked by Murdoch with the shovel. After a short struggle, Monk manages to grab the shovel. But as he is about to take a swing, Murdoch grabs a container of cleaning fluid and throws the contents into Monk's face. Monk staggers back against the truck, screaming in agonizing pain, and collapses.
A short time later, Natalie arrives looking for Monk. Hearing Monk groaning, she rushes back behind the fire engine and finds him rubbing his eyes. As she helps Monk to his feet, she calls for help and instructs Monk to find a chair to sit down in. But Monk then tells Natalie he can't see the chair.
Monk is rushed to the hospital to be examined. The doctor tells Stottlemeyer and Disher that the solvent that the attacker threw into Monk's face was composed of detergent and muriatic acid, causing severe optic nerve damage. Whether or not Monk's eyesight will come back is unclear at this point in time. Randy tries to reassure Monk that he and Stottlemeyer are doing everything they can to find Murdoch, but Stottlemeyer cuts him off when he realizes that Randy is only making the crisis worse. Monk is very crippled at the loss of his vision, despite Natalie telling him that there's always hope.
At the police station, a School for the Blind teacher puts Stottlemeyer and Disher through an empathy exercise to teach them what Monk is dealing with (Stottlemeyer admits that he feels hopeless and Randy admits to feeling disoriented). Wearing blindfolds, they are told to stand up from the couch in Stottlemeyer's office, make their way to the water cooler on the other side of the squad room, and then pour themselves a paper cup of water. Randy does this rather clumsily, bumping into detectives' desks twice and knocking things over, while Stottlemeyer feels around with the palms of his hands and tries to reassure one detective that everything is under control. At the conclusion of the exercise, Stottlemeyer confides to the teacher that her advice is useless for a guy with Monk's personality, having known him for much longer than her. He expresses personal doubt that Monk will be able to function, given Monk's fragile condition. The teacher tells Stottlemeyer that it's up to him to "make" Monk function properly, getting him back to investigating. Stottlemeyer appears skeptical.
At his apartment, Monk has become quite upset at the fact that he might never see his pictures of Trudy again. Natalie convinces Monk to continue investigating, since Monk may not have sight but he does have the senses of smell, sound, touch and taste to rely upon. She tries to use examples of people who did great things while blind, like Mr. Magoo and blind singer Ray Charles, as role models that Monk can follow. 
Midway through, Stottlemeyer shows up and asks Monk to accompany him down to the firehouse. Monk is unwilling to come along, pointing out that he gave Randy a detailed statement of what happened during the attack. Stottlemeyer gets Monk on his feet by reminding him that he can't make his condition a personal matter because Rusty was killed, making Monk the sole eyewitness in a homicide investigation.
Monk is brought back to the firehouse. After making a few mistakes with trying to locate items in the garage, Natalie suggests to Monk that he use his photographic memory to recreate the room as it was when he was attacked. After they sit Monk down at the chair he was sitting in when Murdoch entered, it becomes easier for them to walk Monk back through his statement. Randy notes that according to his story, his attacker was 6'1", heavyset, with sandy hair, and he was wearing a leather motorcycle jacket. He also reeked of rum, like he had been drinking. After Monk gets tangled up in the crime scene tape stretched between the wall and the fire engine's back bumper, Natalie walks him back towards the street. As he is leaving, Monk brushes his shoulder against a rack of firefighting protective coats, and suddenly stops. He immediately realizes that there were six coats on the rack before the attack, but there is one missing. The fire captain takes notice and agrees with Monk's observation. The obvious conclusion is that Murdoch stole it.
Some days later, Monk is later being assisted by a walking cane. He and Natalie arrive at the police station, where Stottlemeyer and Disher have brought in a drifter named Jake Colbert. According to Stottlemeyer, Colbert has no alibi, is the correct height, and was wearing the missing coat. As Monk has no eyesight, he cannot identify Colbert as the guy through a regular lineup. Furthermore, Colbert swears that he found the coat in a dumpster in an alleyway behind a restaurant in the Tenderloin. Monk is told that he must feel Colbert's face to identify him, and he does so, reluctantly at first. When Monk does so, he finds a wart on Colbert's chin, and he is certain that Colbert is "not" the killer, even though he was found wearing the fireman's coat when he was picked up.
Later, Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher travel to the alley where Colbert found the jacket. Reading from his notebook, Randy mentions that Colbert's story checks out. He claimed that he was in the alleyway that afternoon collecting bottles and cans and found the missing coat in a dumpster. He also found a fireman's helmet which he gave to a couple of passing children. Monk is skeptical: Colbert found the coat at 5:00 PM, and Rusty was killed at around 2:00 PM, so why would someone be determined enough to attack two people to steal firefighting gear, but toss it away within a few hours? While they are in the alleyway, Monk is overly delighted to find that he can't see the alley's low-life inhabitants, including a pair of rats scrounging around in the garbage cans, the cockroaches, or even a dead cat, and actually for once sees the positives of being blind.
Stottlemeyer puts the lid on a garbage can to hide a pair of scrounging rats, and he admits that they are in the same neighborhood as the house fire that Fire Company 53's crew was responding to when Monk had been attacked. He notes that the young woman who lived there was killed in the fire, and had fallen asleep smoking a cigarette in front of the TV. Monk, however, realizes that there might be something about the fire that's connected to the attack at the firehouse.
Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher travel to the burned out remains of the house. Monk feels his way around the bathroom (not caring at all about the fact that he is getting soot all over his hands), and then makes his way to the living room. Stottlemeyer notes that the fire was started when the victim fell asleep and a lit cigarette ignited a pile of old newspapers. The victim was a young 27 year old woman named Stefanie Preston, and she'd been working as a temp for Peter Breen Construction, a local construction company, for the past eight weeks. Although the file says that Stefanie lived alone, Monk finds some men's cologne in the bathroom, two toothbrushes, and two types of toothpaste, clues which suggest that she had a boyfriend. In the living room, Monk picks up a scorched bottle on a table and notes that it smells of rum, and he remembers that his attacker reeked of rum. He also finds the impression of a rearing horse etched into the glass on the coffee table, next to a gob of melted plastic that used to be the remote, and realizes that something doesn't make sense: if Stefanie was "watching" TV, then why is the remote at the opposite end of the table from where her upper body would have been? With this, he realizes what the firehouse attack was about.
Here's What Happened.
Murdoch strangled Stefanie, made it look like she'd fallen asleep on the couch, then started the fire by throwing a lit cigarette onto a pile of newspapers. As he was fleeing the scene, he must have stopped and realized he forgot something in the house, probably a metal object that could survive the fire and be traced back to him if the police ever found it. Murdoch could not simply go back to the crime scene to retrieve the object, however, because he'd made his realization just as a fire engine was speeding past him, sirens wailing, responding to the fire. To gain access to the scene, he needed a fireman's coat, so Murdoch went to the firehouse. After killing Rusty and blinding Monk, Murdoch grabbed a coat and helmet, and returned to the house (by now fully engulfed in flames). Murdoch looked like one of the real firemen, so in the chaos, none of the cops or firemen noticed him or questioned him as he slipped right through the crime scene tape, walked right into the house, and retrieved the incriminating object.
Monk is elated, realizing that, even without his sight, he's still a great detective. In session with Dr. Kroger, Monk tells him that he feels liberated - losing his sight has halved the number of his fears, and he has a whole new life to "look" forward to. Troubled, Dr. Kroger thinks he's still in denial over his loss.
Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher visit the construction site where Stefanie Preston worked to interview Peter Breen (Jamie Kaler), her boss. Breen suggests that Monk wait in the construction trailer, but Monk insists on being treated like everyone else. As Natalie guides Monk along, she has to stop him from touching some coils of barbed wire. 
Although busy issuing instructions to workers, Breen admits that he knew Stefanie intermittently, and he hired her because his regular girl was on maternity leave. He also claims that he's never been to Stefanie Preston's house. When asked to supply an alibi for the approximate time of Stefanie's and Rusty's deaths, Breen claims he was on-site talking with some of his employees. Randy notices and takes an interest in Breen's Ferrari sports car. During their conversation, Eddie Murdoch comes up to Breen, and reassures Breen that he still has his keys. Breen tells Murdoch that they'll take care of that matter later. Monk hears a squeaking noise from the treads of Murdoch's shoes, and he recognizes the squeak as being the same consistency as that of the one he heard when Rusty was attacked.
Monk takes off after Murdoch, but Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher do not see him leaving. Monk catches up to Murdoch in another room, and quickly feels Murdoch's face, identifying him as the killer. Murdoch prepares to kill Monk to eliminate the sole witness to Rusty's death, using a saw, but Monk whips him several times with his cane and then hurls several objects at him, overpowering Murdoch long enough for Monk to steal his nametag and escape. Murdoch recovers, and chases after Monk, but by hiding behind a wall, Monk is narrowly able to throw Murdoch off course. Murdoch goes running up the stairs, thinking that he'll find Monk up there. After briefly getting lost, Monk stumbles into an out-of-order construction elevator, and tries to start it up. It shudders, only getting a few inches up, causing him to mistakenly believe that he has ridden it up to the top level of the construction site, and is balancing precariously on a girder high in the air (which is in fact sitting on the ground). He learns the truth when Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher rush in and find him ("Natalie, are you... flying?").
Monk quickly hands Randy the nametag he snatched from Murdoch. No sooner has Randy read Murdoch's name when there is a scream as Murdoch falls down a shaft to his death. Stottlemeyer and Disher identify him, and Randy suggests that Murdoch clearly looks like he slipped while trying to escape.
Back at the hospital, Monk is examined again, and the doctor is cautiously optimistic, saying that Monk's eyesight is returning gradually. Monk, however, has lost all his former optimism after the humiliation of screaming for help while standing on a steel beam ten inches off the ground, and believes that there might be a chance that his eyesight might not return. Randy assures Monk that indeed, Eddie Murdoch is the person who killed Stefanie Preston and Rusty. He has just returned from Murdoch's house and found the clothes he had been wearing when he started the fire covered with soot and sitting in a laundry hamper.
Natalie and Randy then leave the hospital, leaving Stottlemeyer with Monk. Monk is having second thoughts about the case: Eddie Murdoch did kill Stefanie Preston and Rusty, but what was his motive? Monk remembers how when they were talking to Peter Breen, Murdoch walked up and he said to Breen, "I still have those keys." He figures that Murdoch must have been talking about the keys to Breen's Ferrari. Monk asks Stottlemeyer what the keychains to Ferraris like Breen's look like, and Stottlemeyer confirms that they are shaped like a rearing horse. They suddenly realize that the rearing-horse impression left on the coffee table at Stefanie Preston's house during the fire came from Peter Breen's keys.
Monk and Stottlemeyer rush down to the morgue in search of the keys. Monk explains his theory. He explains that while Eddie Murdoch killed Stefanie Preston and Rusty, and he was the man that attacked Monk at the firehouse, none of it was his idea: Breen paid him to do it. Breen was the one having the affair; he had keys to Stefanie's house, which he loaned to Murdoch so that Murdoch could kill her and then stage an "accidental" fire. He'd left the keys behind, and Murdoch panicked, realizing that the police would have been able to trace the impression to Breen's keys (which Breen would have had a hard time explaining). However, by that time, the first engine companies had arrived on the scene. He went to the firehouse to steal a fireman's coat. After killing Rusty and blinding Monk, he stole the gear he needed, went back to the house, retrieved the keys, and ditched the turnout gear in a dumpster.
Monk and Stottlemeyer eventually locate Murdoch's body. They find the keys they are looking for in a plastic bag containing Murdoch's personal effects. Just as Stottlemeyer grabs the keys and tells Monk that they've found Exhibit A, one of the "corpses" rises from its gurney and casts off the sheet. It is Peter Breen, who has followed Eddie Murdoch's body to the morgue to recover his keys and destroy the one remaining piece of evidence against him. Breen knocks Stottlemeyer out with a mallet, and then handcuffs him to a gurney, then grabs a knife to prepare to kill Monk. He also manages to take Monk's cane. Monk grabs Stottlemeyer’s gun, and with his eyesight beginning to return just in the nick of time, shoots Breen in the chest, then leans down to check on Stottlemeyer, who realizes that Monk can see him.
A few nights later, Monk, having made a full recovery, is reading in his armchair, glancing up to admire his many pictures of Trudy on the wall.
