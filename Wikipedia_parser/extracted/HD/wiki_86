Dixton Wood

Dixton Wood () is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire, notified in 2000. Dixton Wood is recognised as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the EU Habitats Directive.
Location.
The wood lies in the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty near Winchcombe and north of Cheltenham. It is a steep east facing woodland, which is surrounded by permanent grassland. It is in the foothills of the scarp and may be considered as a similar landscape feature as that of the nearby Bredon Hill which is a National Nature Reserve (NNR).
Protected Species interest.
The site is notified for its population of Violet Click Beetle "(Limoniscus violaceus)", and for a deadwood (saproxylic) beetle assemblage. The Violet Click Beetle is protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981 (as amended) and listed on Annex IIa of the EC Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild
fauna and flora. Its presence indicates the great importance of the wood, and indicates habitat of a high quality for this special invertebrate group (deadwood beetle fauna).
The beetle is currently only known elsewhere in Britain on Bredon Hill NNR and in Windsor Forest. There are also some fifteen sites in central Europe.
Woodland structure.
There is a well-developed high forest structure and the management of the wood has yielded a number of large, low ash pollards and a range of deadwood. The moist clay soils, the eastern aspect and the ground and scrub maintain a humid microclimate. This is likely to enhance the decay process, which has resulted in a continuity of forest conditions.
Reports in by Natural England in November 2010 are detailed in the ageing of the trees, and planting needs to maintain the favourability of the site.

The country is fielding its smallest delegation to date: a single athlete, female sprinter Thin Seng Hon. As no Cambodian athlete qualified for the Games, the country received a wildcard invitation to send one competitor in track and field events.
Thin "was born without a fully formed right leg", and uses a "$2 500 J-shaped running blade" prosthetic. Her coach, pointing out that her prosthetic is "not custom-built for sprinting and is less comfortable and shock absorbent than those owned by her first world rivals", has argued she is likely to be disadvantaged by a "technology gap", as well as by poverty; Thin "trains on a dirt track and balances running with a full-time job at a souvenir shop".

<doc id="36841590" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36841590" title="Kagoshima verb conjugations">
Kagoshima verb conjugations

The verbal morphology of the Kagoshima dialects is heavily marked by numerous distinctive phonological processes, as well as both morphological and lexical differences. The following article deals primarily with the changes and differences affecting the verb conjugations of the central Kagoshima dialect, spoken throughout most of the mainland and especially around Kagoshima City, though notes on peripheral dialects may be added. Like standard Japanese, verbs do not inflect for person or plurality, and come in nine basic stems. However, contrary to the standard language, all verbs ending with the stem "-ru" conjugate regularly as consonant-stem verbs, though irregularities are present in other forms.
Most notably, the distinction and irregular conjugation pattern of the "shimo nidan" or "lower bigrade" ending "-(y)uru", which corresponds to standard Japanese "-eru", is still preserved in the dialect. However, "kami nidan" or "upper bigrade" verbs ending in "-iru" have merged with all other verbs ending in "-ru", in a similar fashion to other Kyushu dialects like that of Ōita.
Imperfective.
The imperfective form, also known as the plain, the dictionary or the non-past form, is primarily used to mark a generic, affirmative action and generally overlaps the present and future tenses in English. So, for instance, a statement like 彼やあそけ行っ "aya asoke iʔ" could mean either "he is going over there" or "he will be going over there". Typically, context will provide the meaning, though temporal adverbs such as 今日 "kyu" "today", 今 "inma" "now" or 明日 "ashita" "tomorrow" may be used for clarification.
With regards to its conjugation paradigm, the imperfective form ends in "-u" for all verbs as in standard Japanese. Notably, however, the resulting stem is reduced according to the dialect's phonological rules. Thus, for vowel stems, "-u" will either coalesce with the previous vowel of the verb or become a moraic obstruent, while for nasal stems it reduces to a moraic nasal and for obstruents, a moraic obstruent. This applies to most areas of Kagoshima with some exceptions: namely, the peripheral islands, such as Ōsumi (including Tanegashima) and Koshikijima, do not reduce the endings.
When used predicatively, verbs in their imperfective form are commonly appended particles such as ど "do" and が "ga" in order to add more emphasis to the statement being said. In this way, 俺や書っど "oya kaddo" "I will write (it)" adds more insistence or assertion than saying 俺や書っ "oya kaʔ" alone. When used attributively, the verb is simply followed directly by the word or phrase it modifies: 書っ人 "kaʔ futo" (or "kaffuto") "a person who writes".
Perfective.
The perfective or completive ending "-ta", and its allomorph "-da", marks an action or an event as a whole, often one that has previously taken place. It is thus frequently referred to as the "past tense" in English descriptions, though this is not always the case. In Southern Tanegashima, this ending is pronounced "-tō" and has "-dō" as its allomorphic variant.
In contrast to standard Japanese, verbs ending in "-u" will take on the form "-uta" rather than "-tta", as in "omou" → "omouta" → "omota". Similarly, a number of verbs with the morphological ending "-gu" will become "-uda", while others will tend towards "-ida". For example, 稼ぐ "kasegu" "labour" becomes "kaseida", which is then coalesced as "kaseda", whereas 繋ぐ "tsunagu" "tie" becomes "tsunouda", which reduces to the form "tsunoda". The same phenomenon can be observed with the "-ku" ending: while most verbs would become "-ita", such as 書く "kaku" "write" → "kaita" → "kete", some also become "-uta", such as 退く "noku" "step aside" → "nouta" → "nota".
Negative.
Negation is expressed by appending the suffix "-n" at the end of a verb in its imperfective stem form. This can be achieved by simply replacing the final "-u" in the underlying plain form with "-a", and then tagging on the negative suffix: "kaku" → "kakan" "not write", "wakaru" → "wakaran" "not understand", etc. The two main irregularities in this form relate to verbs that stem in "-ru" and "-su" in their plain forms. Verbs with the stem "-ru" may take on the ending "-tan" instead of "-ran", especially if the preceding syllable is a devoiced one. So the negative form of the verb "shiru" "know" is "shitan" rather than "shiran", as the syllable "shi" is devoiced. The alternative ending "-yan" is much more rare, occurring only in a few regions, and most prominently only when the preceding syllable contains a non-devoiced . For verbs with the stem "-su", the ending may be realized as either "-san" or "-han" with no rules governing its use other than speaker and dialect preference.
Verbs whose underlying imperfective form ends in "-uru" ("-eru" in standard Japanese), otherwise known as "shimo nidan" or "lower bigrade" verbs, are also noticeably irregular. For such verbs, the entire ending become "-en" when negated. For example, the underlying verb 見ゆる "miyuru" becomes 見えん "mien" "not be seen", and 投ぐる "naguru" becomes 投げん "nagen" "not give up". 
Contrary to popular belief, the suffix "-n" does not derive from a relaxed pronunciation of the standard negative form "-nai", as demonstrated through the discrepancy between such forms as "minai" → *"miran" "not see", and "shinai" → *"sen" "not do". Further, considering the phonological characteristics of the dialect, the form "-ne" would be expected if such were the case. Rather, the negative suffix "-n" derives from the older attributive suffix "-nu", which can still be encountered in various literary works. And while the oldest examples showing "-nai" date back to the 16th century, "-nu" is attested as early as the 8th century in the Kojiki, and is believed to have already been reduced to its present form "-n" during the Edo period. The first line of the 11th century classical novel The Tale of Genji provides an example of its use: ""(...) ito yamugoto-naki kifa-ni-fa ara-nu ga (...)"", translated as "though (she) is not quite of a nobel birth".
The past negative form can be accomplished by compounding the regular negative verb form with the past form of the copula, yielding such constructions as "kakanjatta", "kakannyatta", or, more rarely, "kakannatta" "did not write" depending on the region's preferred variant. The form "-nkatta", as in "kakankatta", has also been observed in the Ōsumi and Morokata regions, as well as the city of Kagoshima itself.
Negative commands or orders are informally marked by tagging on the suffix "-na" to the plain form: 行く "iku" "to go" → 行っな "inna", "iʔna" (most regions), 行くな "ikuna" (Tanegashima, Koshikijima), 行っだ "idda" (Yakushima) "don't go". In western Ōsumi, the "-na" suffix commonly co-occurs with the auxiliary verb "yaru", which is then combined to the continuative "i" form of a verb: 行く "iku" → 行っきゃっな "ikkyanna". Formally, negative commands are marked by appending "-ji(n)" either directly to the imperfective ending or to the negative form: 行く "iku" → 行かぢ "ikaji", or 行かんじ "ikanji" "do not go".
Lastly, the negative form can also be used as a suggestive or light imperative when followed by the particle か "ka". Thus, for the verb "eat", 食わんか "kuwan ka" would effectively mean along the lines of "go ahead and eat" or simply "(please) eat". Note that this form is not the same as the standard Japanese construction "-nai ka?", as it functions more as an imperative than a negative question. So a sentence like ゆっくい行かんか "yukkui ikan ka" would mean "(please) go slowly" and not "won't you go slowly?", unless the intonation is explicitly rising.
"i" form.
The "i form", also called the conjunctive, the continuative, the infinitive, the nominative or the "ren'yōkei" form, may be used for two main purposes: deriving nouns from verbs and creating compound constructions. This form can be achieved by simply changing the vowel "-u" of the underlying plain form to "-i", and then applying the necessary sound changes afterwards. Contrary to the standard Japanese language, this form is completely regular for verbs ending with the plain stem "-ru". Thus, the underlying verb 食もる "tamoru" "eat" would become 食もい "tamoi" (< "tamori"), instead of just reducing to the root as in standard Japanese.
There may, however, be some irregularity when deriving nouns or compounds, as verbs ending with the plain stems "-u" and "-ru" may become a moraic obstruent as opposed to the vowel . For example, the underlying verb 買う "kau" "buy" could become in its nominal form rather than "buying", also creating a doublet between かっもん and けもん "shopping". Similarly, the underlying verb 知る "shiru" "know" could become rather than , leading to the polite construction 知っもさん "not know" rather than .
Further, when the "i form" is used in a compound construction and the second verb begins with a vowel or a palatal consonant, the underlying stem may: 
The use of the "i form" for linking verbs together and creating compounds is especially prominent for adding a nuance of politeness. The verbs やる "yaru", やす "yasu" and やんす "yansu", for instance, act as honorific auxiliaries and are frequently used in imperative constructions as in 食もいやんせ "tamoi-yanse" "please eat" or 遊っびゃんせ "asubbyanse" "please play" (also 遊っやんせ "asuʔ-yanse"), which would be the equivalent of 食べなさい "tabenasai" and 遊びなさい "asobinasai" in standard Japanese. Similarly, the verbs もす "mosu" (or もうす "mōsu" in Tanegashima) and もんす "monsu", sometimes written as 申す and 申んす, will add a degree of politeness akin to the standard Japanese ending ます "-masu". Thus, for 食もる "tamoru" "eat" and 読む "nomu" "drink", the polite forms would be 食もいもす "tamoi-mosu" and 飲んもす "non-mosu" respectively.
"Te" form.
The "te form" or the participle form functions in much the same way as it does in standard Japanese, being able to link different verbs and clauses together, and on its own expressing a slight command. It differs, however, largely in its pronunciation. Depending on the speaker and dialect, it might be pronounced anywhere from , , or , which may or may not be reflected with the spellings て "te", ちぇ "che", っせ(え) "sse(e)" and っしぇ(ー) "sshe(e)". Its voiced counterpart "de" exhibits the same phenomenon, being pronounced , or , which could be written as で "de", ぢぇ "je" or じぇ "je" respectively. The spellings て "te" and で "de" are here favoured, though the affricated pronunciations and are the most common.
The form also differs slightly in its paradigm, as verbs that end with the morphological ending "-u" will take on the form "-ute" rather than "-tte", which is used in the standard language. For example, the underlying verb 会う "au" "meet" would become あうて "aute", which is then coalesced to the form おて "ote". Similarly, a number of verbs with the morphological ending "-gu" will become "-ude", while others will tend towards "-ide". For example, 剥ぐ "hagu" "tear off" becomes "haide", which is then coalesced as "hede", while 急ぐ "isogu" "rush" becomes "isoude" in its underlying form, which is then coalesced as "isode". This can also be observed with the ending "-ku", although to a much lesser extent. Most verbs ending in "-ku" will become "-ite" in this form, so that 書く "kaku" "write" becomes "kaite", which is then coalesced as "kete". A few others will become "-ute", so that 退く "noku" "step aside/down" becomes "noute", which is coalesced as "note". Lastly, for verbs with the stems "-mu" and "-bu", the ending "-nde" may be optionally vocalized as "-ude". So 飛ぶ "tobu" "fly" could become either "tonde" or "tode" (< "toude"). And for verbs ending in "-su", the form "-shite" may be reduced to "-ite", so that 貸す "kasu" "lend" becomes "kaite" instead of "kashite", which may be coalesced into "kete".
The continuous or progressive aspect, which is formed with the "te form" followed by the auxiliary いる "iru" in standard Japanese, follows a similar development in most Kagoshima dialects, using the auxiliary verb おる "oru" instead. The "te form" is then combined and merged with the verb, becoming ちょる "-choru" or in some areas とる "-toru", which have ぢょる (じょる) "-joru" and どる "doru" as their respective voiced counterparts. Thus, as the "te form" of the verb 食う "kuu" "eat" is くて "kute", its progressive form would generally be expressed as 食ちょっ "kuchoʔ" "eating", while the progressive form of 読む "yomu" "read" would become either 読んぢょっ "yonjoʔ" or 読ぢょっ "yojoʔ" "reading", reflecting the voicing in its participle forms 読んで "yonde" and 読で "yode". In other dialects, the continuous-progressive aspect is constructed using the "i form" followed by the auxiliary "oru". Some dialects may even make a semantic distinction between the two, with the first marking the resultative aspect, and the second, the continuous aspect. So 雨が降っちょっ "ame ga futchoʔ" would effectively mean "it has rained", while 雨が降よっ "ame ga fuyoʔ" would mean "it is raining".
Imperative.
The imperative form is achieved by replacing the vowel "-u" of the underlying plain form to "-e", and subsequently applying the appropriate sound changes. Namely, vowel coalescence is usually observed with verbs whose stem ends in just a vowel, and for verbs whose stem is "-ru", the resulting form "-re" is often reduced to "-i", so that 食もれ "tamore" would become 食もい "tamoi" "eat!". This leads to overlap with the "i form", though context is usually sufficient to disambiguate the two. The form is regularized in comparison to standard Japanese, as the dialect only makes use of the ending "-e" and never "-ro" as an imperative, and the form "-i" observed with "-ru" verbs is here the result of a regular sound change, whereas in Japanese it is not so due to borrowing from the Kansai dialect.
In order to form polite imperative commands, the auxiliary verb やる "yaru", along with its variants やす "yasu" and やんす "yansu", may be changed to its imperative form and appended to another verb in its conjunctive "i form". For example, the polite form of the verb "eat" could become 食もいやい "tamoi-yai" or 食もいやんせ "tamoi-yanse" "please eat!". When it comes to verbs whose stems reduce to a moraic obstruent in the "i form", two outcomes are possible. First, the auxiliary can be appended directly without any change, giving 書っやい "kaʔ-yai" for "please write". Otherwise, the underlying stem will usually be doubled and subsequently glided in order to avoid a hiatus, resulting in the form 書っきゃい "kakkyai" for "please write".
Volitional (Presumptive).
The volitional or presumptive form is essentially used to express either intention or probability. It is historically formed by appending the speculative or intentional suffix "-u", itself a reduction of the earlier form "you", to the conjunctive "i" form. The resulting ending was then contracted to "-ō" and later "-o" in the mainland dialects. One main exception to this is that for verbs whose underlying imperfective form ends in "-uru" ("-eru" in standard Japanese), otherwise known as "shimo nidan" or "lower bigrade" verbs, the entire ending is reduced to "-u" instead. For example, the verb 開くっ "akuʔ" (standard 開ける "akeru") "open" becomes 開く "aku" "intend on opening", and 上ぐっ "aguʔ" (standard 上げる "ageru") "raise" becomes 上ぐ "agu" "intend on raising". Another exception is that, for verbs modelled off the verbs "to do" or "to come", otherwise known as "sagyō" and "kagyō" irregular verbs, the endings become "-sū" or "-ku" respectively.
This form is also noticeably used in conjunction with the verb ごたっ "gotaʔ" (ごたる "gotaru"), or its variants ごあっ "goaʔ" and ごちゃっ "gochaʔ", to indicate desire or express a wish to do something. For example, 食ぉごたっ "kwo-gotaʔ" means "want to eat", あすぼごたっ "asubo-gotaʔ" means "want to play", and 投ぐごあっ "nagu-goaʔ" (from the "shimo nidan" verb 投ぐる "naguru") means "want to give up". This auxiliary verb can also be used with more stative verbs to indicate the notion of "it seems to be", "it looks", or "it looks like it is going to". For instance, 雨が降ろごたっ "ame ga furo-gotaʔ" effectively means "it looks like it will rain".
Causative.
The causative form differs from standard Japanese in that it becomes "-(was)asuru" rather than "-(was)aseru". This form can be achieved by replacing the final "-u" in the underlying plain form with "-asuru" or, for verbs stemming in just "-u", "-wasasuru". These are then reduced to "-asuʔ" and "-wasasuʔ" respectively following regular sound changes, though the latter ending may further reduce to "-wassuʔ" in speech, resulting in 食ゎっすっ "kwassuʔ" instead of 食ゎさすっ "kwasasuʔ" "to make (someone) eat". The difference observed between the dialectal form "-(as)asuru" and the standard form "-(as)aseru" is also representative of the fact that this form conjugates like other "shimo nidan" or "lower bigrade" verbs. Consequently, it is notably irregular in comparison to other "-ru" verbs in the "i form" and imperative form where it becomes "-sase", as well as the volitional form where it becomes "-sasu". It is also irregular in the negative form, where it becomes "-sasen".
Passive.
The passive form conjugates like other "shimo nidan" or "lower bigrade" verbs ending in "-uru".

U.S. Lady was a magazine aimed at wives of men in the U.S. military. It was launched in 1955 by George Lincoln Rockwell as a money-making venture after his discharge from the U.S. Navy Reserve. "U.S. Lady" vigorously promoted the role of military wives as the unofficial ambassadors in host nations. Due to conflicts with his business partners and financial backers, Rockwell sold the magazine the following year, having published only four issues. "U.S. Lady" magazine was purchased in 1956 by Avandee and John Adams, two civilian journalists.
In 1958, Rockwell founded the American Nazi Party. Subsequent to that, Avandee and John Adams said they knew nothing of the original publisher's extremist views; and they assured readers that Rockwell was not involved with the magazine in any way after its sale. Rockwell's political views had never been espoused in the magazine during his tenure with "U.S. Lady".

<doc id="36841787" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36841787" title="Esteban de Perea">
Esteban de Perea

Esteban de Perea (or Estevan de Peréa) was a Spanish Franciscan monk who undertook missionary work in New Mexico, a province of New Spain between 1610 and 1638.
At times he was in conflict with the governors of the province.
He has been called the "Father of the New Mexican Church".
Origins.
Esteban de Perea was born in Villanueva del Fresno, in Extremadura, Spain near the Portuguese border.
Both his parents were Portuguese and came from a region that was home to many Jews.
The conquest of the Emirate of Granada, with its large populations of Moslems and Jews, had been completed in 1492.
Those who refused to convert to Christianity had been deported from Spain.
However, the church was suspicious that some converts remained true to Jewish beliefs in private.
In 1629 the Mexican Inquisition conducted a thorough inquiry into Perea's "purity of blood".
Two witnesses testified that his mother's family was "tainted with new Christian blood", but the Franciscans chose to ignore this evidence.
Early career.
Fray Esteban de Perea arrived in New Mexico in 1610, and soon after established the mission of "Neustra Senora de los Dolores" (Our Lady of Sorrows) at Sandia Pueblo, to the south of Santa Fe.
The viceroy received a complaint about the mission at Sandia from the municipality of Santa Fe,
which said that the mission had taken so much of the limited supply of iron that there was
not enough left for civilian needs.
After visiting the Hopi people, Perea wrote enthusiastically about the industrious and moral people, with well-built houses, in a land that resembled Spain.
The church assumed that the main objective in New Mexico was to convert the Indians, and the civil power existed only in order to provide protection and to support this goal. As chief judge and head of the army, the governor had equal powers but different objectives, so clashes were inevitable.
On 12 August 1613 the Franciscan leader Fray Isidro Ordóñez and his followers arrested the governor Pedro de Peralta and had him chained and imprisoned in the mission at Sandia. His jailer was Fray Esteban de Perea, who disapproved but obeyed.
The Custodia de la Conversion de San Pablo del Nuevo Mexico, a religious province, was set up by Franciscan friars around 1616 or 1617.
Perea was elected first custodian, becoming the head of the church in New Mexico.
Perea had many disputes with the temporal Governor Juan de Eulate from 1618 to 1626.
In 1620 the Viceroy of New Spain heard complaints from the Indians of abuses of power, and sent orders regulating the treatment of Indians to both Perea and Juan de Eulate.
In 1620 Perea reported missionary progress to Mexico City, and based on this six friars were dispatched to New Mexico with the annual supply caravan of 1621.
Perea left office that year, but remained in New Mexico.
Tensions between church and state rose to such a level that in 1622 the Franciscans considered abandoning New Mexico altogether, and only decided to remain due to Perea's frantic pleas.
In 1626 Fray Alonso de Benavides was appointed custodian and also commissary of the Holy Office of the Inquisition for the province,
giving him power second only to that of the temporal governor (and at times greater).
Perea temporarily left New Mexico.
Benavides visited all the pueblos, found that the friars were succeeding in their efforts to convert the local people, and in 1626 asked for more missionaries.
King Philip IV of Spain, who valued the land mainly because of the number of souls to be saved, ordered the dispatch of thirty more friars.
Second term as custodian.
In 1629, Perea returned to New Mexico with about thirty friars and several lay brothers to undertake missionary work,
possibly traveling with the new governor of New Mexico, Captain Don Francisco Manuel de Silva Nieto.
He was sent to New Mexico by the Franciscan Province of the Holy Gospel, based in Mexico City.
He was special inspector, the agent of the Inquisition, and also custodian.
He replaced Benavides.
Governor Silva was more friendly to the friars than his predecessors had been, and helped them in their work.
By the end of 1629 New Mexico had about thirty-five missions served by forty-six friars for a population of around 35,000 converted Indians.
Perea brought with him a letter of inquiry from the archbishop in Mexico City, following up on a letter from the confessor of the Spanish nun María de Ágreda.
She had been falling into trances in which she reported that she had been transported to some people called Jumanos, to whom she preached.
Although she did not name the places she had visited, the priests in Spain thought it sounded like New Mexico.
As it happened, several groups of Jumanos Indians had shown up at the New Mexico missions, saying they had been visited by a young woman in blue and that
she had told them to ask for friars to be sent to them from the missions.
The friars immediately connected the two, and investigations began to verify the miracle.
On 23 June 1629 Perea accompanied Silva on an expedition to Zuni with thirty soldiers, ten wagons, four hundred cavalry horses and a group of priests. Perhaps due to the size of the force, they were well received by the local people of Zuni.
The soldiers made a show of great respect to the friars, going down on their knees and kissing their feet, and told the Indians they should do the same.
Perea took the welcome to mean that "God hath already disposed this vineyard."
A cross and a great platform were built in the Hawikuh plaza.
The next day the Spanish conducted mass and baptized many of the Zuni leaders.
Although things seemed to be going very well, Perea noted that the Indians "are very observant of superstitious idolatry... they have their gods in the mountains, in the rivers, in the harvests, and in their houses."
A house was bought for the friars, serving as the first church in the province. Silva helped the Franciscans to set up other missions near Zuni.
One was established at Hawwikku, about down the Zuni valley, and another farther west at the Hopi village of Awatobi.
Perea and Governor Silva gave Fray Juan Ramirez an escort further west to Ácoma.
The peace with the people of Zuni did not last. The Franciscan missionary father Juan Letrado was killed in February 1632 one week after he arrived in Zuni.
In March 1632 a party of soldiers was sent to Zuni to avenge the missionary's death.
Perea painted conditions during Silva's governorship in a poor light. He recorded that the local whites and half-castes were superstitious and influenced by Indian customs. Men were unfaithful to their wives, and the wives used Indian love-potions and spells in attempts to win back their affections.
Peyote was being illegally trafficked in New Mexico. Perea recorded in 1631 that "Ana Cadimo mestiza ... says that it was about a year ago that the Indians ... were telling her that she was betwitched, and that she should take "peiote" and that with it she would see means of a vision the person who had bewitched her and done her evil."
The fathers had to use harsh measures, asserting their authority to stamp out evil practices.
Later years.
Perea remained custodian until 1631.
In 1632 he published an account of the missionary activity in New Mexico.
In 1633, Perea was serving as a missionary at Quarai, where he wrote that the governor was letting colonists encroach on the jointly owned fields of the Indians and of the mission.
He remained with the Franciscans until his death in New Mexico in 1638 or 1639.
He was buried in the mission that he had founded at Sandia.
Opposed to forced conversion, as were most missionaries, he said, "With suavity and mildness an obstinate spirit can better be reclaimed than with violence and rigor."
According to France V. Scholes, "Perea was one of the great figures in the history of the Church in New Mexico. For some thirty years, except for the brief period from 1626 to 1629, he was the dominant figure in the religious life of the province... His long years of service, and his paramount influence give him a pre-eminent position in New Mexican history, a position greater than that of Bonavides. Perea, more than any other friar, deserves the honor of being called the Father of the New Mexican Church."

Woodcock Hill Village Green

Woodcock Hill Village Green or Woodcock Hill Open Space is an area of grass and woodland in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire in England. It was designated a Village Green in 2008 to prevent development of the site.
History.
Woodcock Hill was first recorded as land donated by Offa, king of Mercia in the late eighth century, to St Albans Abbey. During the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 the leading courtier Sir Anthony Denny acquired the land from King Henry VIII. In 1588 it was the location of one of the chain of beacons used to warn of the approach of the Spanish Armada, and during the Napoleonic Wars it was one of the Admiralty's chain of telegraph stations, sending messages to Hampstead Heath to the south and St Albans to the north. In the 1860s two railway tunnels were built at Woodcock Hill, and clay from the tunnels was used to make brick for local houses.
Battle against development.
In 1959 the Woodcock Hill Society was formed to fight against development of the site, and it later merged with the Elstree & Borehamwood Green Belt Society. In 1996 the land was identified as possible for development and a new organisation, Woodcock Hill Open Space Forever (WHOSE), was formed to protect it. In 2004 Hertsmere councillor and WHOSE chair Patricia Strack applied to Hertfordshire County Council to have the area declared a Village Green under the Commons Registration Act 1965, which would permanently protect it against development. A public enquiry in November 2007 found in favour of the application, and the County Council ratified Woodcock Hill as a Village Green on 9 July 2008. In December of the same year the committee of WHOSE formed the Woodcock Hill Village Green Trust.
Boundaries.
The site is bounded by Barnet Lane to the south, the railway line to the west, and Vale Avenue and Carrington Avenue to the north.

Blaina and District Hospital (alternatively Blaina and Nantyglo Community Hospital) was a community hospital in Blaina. It was latterly operated by the Aneurin Bevan Local Health Board. The hospital was opened in 1910, paid for from subscriptions by local mining communities and became part of the NHS in 1948. It was closed in 2010 and services were transferred to Ysbyty Aneurin Bevan in Ebbw Vale.
The late Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother opened the maternity ward on 17 March 1932 when she was the Duchess of York.
As of 2012 the site is disused. There are proposals to demolish the buildings in order to build retirement homes, but there is local pressure to retain some of the remains for community use.

Geography of Mizoram

Mizoram is a land of rolling hills, valleys, rivers and lakes. As many as 21 major hills ranges or peaks of different heights run through the length and breadth of the state, with plains scattered here and there. The average height of the hills to the west of the state are about . These gradually rise up to to the east. Some areas, however, have higher ranges which go up to a height of over .
Geology and minerals.
The folded structure of the Mizoram ranges are at the junction of two moving tectonic plates(Indian and Burmese Desi Kachar 1974). On 19 April 2011 there was a 4.3 earthquake about 10 km North of Kolasib and a 6.4 was recorded on 4 February 2011. Mizoram is in the highest zone 5 for earthquakes.
The folded hilly or mountainous North South belts, with perpendicular faults, comprise sediments of the Surma (Middle Bhuban Formation), Barail and Tipam groups. There is Aluvium in river beds consisting of deposits of argillaceous and arenaceous sandstones, shale, siltstones and mudstones and greywacke. A 560m thick rock succession of the Middle Bhuban type exposed between Bawngkawn and Durtlang shows 7 normal and 7 reverse magneto strata (North and South pole reversals) showing its age to be around 20 Million years old. The rock system is generally weak, unstable, weathered and prone to seismic and weather influence producing landslides. The soft, black to grey rock is used locally for building materials and for low trafficked road construction work. There are no useful minerals of economic significance apart from clays in the River Tlawng beds. Typical soils are sandy loam, clay loam that have been heavily leached due to the high slopes leaving it porous and lacking in minerals or humus.
A number of oil and gas exploration activities have taken place due the geological condition with which Mizoram has been formed, leading to the possibilities and high expectation that reserves would be confirmed. France, Russia and Cyprus as well as several Indian companies have already signed a 12% oil and 10% gas royalty arrangement with proceeds going direct to Mizoram state on any production (April 2009)

Microshaft Winblows 98

Microshaft Winblows 98 is a video game developed and released by Parroty Interactive. It parodies the then-popular Windows 98 operating system, as well as Microsoft and Windows' creator, Bill Gates. It touches on several scandals of the time which Microsoft was involved in.
When started, the game presents a bootsplash much like the one on the Windows 9x operating systems before presenting the user with a desktop from which various "applications" can be launched; these include spoofs of computer games (such as "Doom"), Microsoft software (such as Internet Explorer), and even sometimes popular fads of the time (such as a "Billagotchi" that parodies Tamagotchi and Microsoft head Bill Gates). The game also has a storyline, where the player starts out as a tech support employee and must work his or her way up to a meeting with Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.
The game is notable for having negative reception, with Richard Cobbett of "PC Gamer" describing it as being "not really a game, although it has a few of them in it, but more of an interactive comedy CD-ROM", although even the parody sketches are "stuck mining geek humour" which Cobbett felt "smacks of non-technical people desperately trying to write jokes in what may as well be a foreign language".

Basha is afflicted with poliomyelitis, which he contracted when he was one year old. Due to this permanent physical impairment, he is unable to ambulate and uses calipers and a wheelchair.
Powerlifting.
Unaware of Paralympic sports, Basha used to compete in bodybuilding contentions. He started powerlifting after his neighbour introduced him to sport for persons with physical disabilities. The first event he participated in was the 1997 National Wheelchair Games, where he won a silver medal. This achievement encouraged him to "pursue the sport with even greater vigour".
In 1998, Basha won a gold medal and set a new national record in the South Zone selection trials for the 1999 FESPIC Games (Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled), held in Bangkok, where he finished seventh overall. He won a gold medal in an event for non-disabled competitors in 2006. This feat "left the Powerlifting Federation of India Powerlifting Federation so upset that" the Federation barred disabled athletes from competing in their events. He represented India at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia. He lifted and finished at tenth spot.
He was awarded with the Arjuna Award in 2008. In 2010, he received the Ekalavya Award – Chief Minister's award for an outstanding sportsperson (for 2008) from the Governor of Karnataka Hansraj Bhardwaj at a ceremony in the Raj Bhavan.
He is sponsored by a company with 5,000–5,500 per month and his wife, Antonita, contributes for rest of the expenditures. She sold all her jewellery in order to make possible her husband's international outing for the 3rd Paralympic World Powerlifting Championship.

Gazdagrét

Gazdagrét is a neighbourhood of Budapest, the capital of Hungary. It is located in the western part of the 11th district. It is a residential area consisting of prefabricated buildings (see panelház) with a population of 11,929 (2001 census).
The neighbourhood was built between 1983 and 1989, during the last of the Communist-era construction booms, and kept the name the area earned for its rich harvests when it consisted mainly of orchards (Gazdagrét literally means "rich meadow"). Due to its amenities and its reputation as a safe neighbourhood, it is the single most popular "panel" housing estate of the city. Gazdagrét is well known from the television series "Szomszédok" ("Neighbours"), which ran between 1987 and 1999 and was shot on location here.
Location.
Most of the area of Gazdagrét is bordered by two streets, "Rétköz utca" from northeast and "Gazdagréti út" from southwest. The nine streets of the neighbourhood run more or less perpendicular to these two, while a pedestrian street, "Kaptató sétány" runs between the two border streets, parallel with them. All three streets lead up to "Gazdagréti tér" ("Gazdagrét square"), which is the neighbourhood's highest area on the hillside. The area covers 0,9 km².
History.
During the archaeological excavation preceding the construction of the residential area, prehistoric vessels and a Roman period cemetery were found (this part of the country used to belong to the Roman province Pannonia and later to Pannonia Inferior). The excavation also found a rectangular, pit-house type home and other buildings from the Middle Ages, when the area was the property of the Pécsvárad Abbey. After the Mongol invasion (1241–42) it become a part of Nevegy, a village known from contemporary documents, and during the reign of Charles Robert, the abbey made an unsuccessful attempt to gain it back. For hundreds of years the area consisted of orchards, and also of vineyards up until the 19th century, when the phylloxera epidemic destroyed them.
The area bore the German name "Reiche Ried" until 1847, when German geographical names were replaced with Hungarian ones. Gazdagrét, a translation of Reiche Ried, refers to the rich harvest the orchards brought due to the rainfalls coming from Western Hungary. The climate of the neighbourhood is noticeably colder and wetter than that of the Inner City.
Gazdagréti út ("Gazdagrét Road") received its name in 1930; by then it was bordered by some residential houses.
The first plans for the construction of a housing estate were created in the 1970s. Construction began in 1983, with prefabricated panels coming from the factories in Győr and Budapest. The first buildings to be constructed were in the lower part of the hill; the first apartment – which was also the 200,000th apartment in the country with central heating – was ready by March 1984. Public transport service started on May 1, 1984, with bus line 153 which has been in operation ever since. Since the houses on the upper part of the hill were still under construction, the terminus of the bus was at Nagyszeben tér and was moved up to Gazdagréti tér in 1987; a new bus line, line 139 started operation at the same time. The first school year at Törökugrató street primary school started in 1984, another primary school was opened in 1985 in Csíkihegyek street. A nursery school opened in 1985, a grocery store in 1986, a doctor's office and a small library in 1987 and a high school in 1990.
Between 1987 and 1999 the popular TV series "Szomszédok" was shot on location in Gazdagrét, making the neighbourhood widely known in the country.
The neighbourhood has a wide area of amenities, several supermarkets, a small shopping mall and several other institutions including nursery schools, primary schools, a secondary school, a post office and a community building. Since the neighbourhood was constructed in the Communist era, originally no churches were planned, but after 1990 a Roman Catholic and a Reformed church were built. A continuing problem is the small number of parking lots in front of the houses, as the neighbourhood wasn't planned to have any garages (which is surprising given the time period when it was built); instead, small shops and cafés use the ground floors, where other housing estate buildings typically have garages. Public safety is exceptionally good and the neighbourhood is clean and attractive when compared to similar neighbourhoods in the city. Due to this, its reputation is favourable. In a 2010 survey, when 500 Budapest residents were asked to name the panel neighbourhood in which they would choose to live, Gazdagrét finished first.
Transport.
Gazdagréti tér is the terminus of four bus lines. Buses 8 and 239 connect the neighbourhood with the Inner City, bus 153 with the district's centre Móricz Zsigmond körtér and bus 139 with Déli Railway Station and the large transport hub Moszkva tér, while bus 108 starts service on 29 March 2014 to connect the neightbourhood to Kelenföld railway station, the terminus of Metro 4 that is set to open on 28 March. The bus stops on Rétköz utca can be reached by buses 108, 139 and 239 (the latter only on weekday mornings and afternoons), while the ones on Gazdagréti út are served by bus 153. Bus 8 doesn't drive through the neighbourhood itself and leaves it immediately after leaving the terminus.
At night Gazdagrét is served by bus line 908.

Chippenham United F.C.

Chippenham United F.C. was an English football club based in Chippenham, Wiltshire. The team played in the Western Football League for twelve seasons after World War II, but left in 1960. They also participated in the FA Cup for fourteen seasons.
League history.
Joining the Western League Division Two for the 1948–49 season, United won the division at their first attempt, gaining promotion to Division One. The following season, they finished above their local rivals Chippenham Town for what was to be the only time in the club's history. United's best league finish was in 1950–51, when they finished fourth, with Town in third position. The following seasons were less successful, and they only escaped relegation in 1955–56 due to expansion of Division One. However, the club was relegated in 1957–58 after finishing bottom of the table. The club dropped out of the Western League at the end of the 1959–60 season, and disbanded a couple of years later.
FA Cup history.
Chippenham United entered the FA Cup throughout the late 1940s and 1950s. During their first Cup run in 1948–49 they defeated Radstock Town before losing 2–1 at home to Trowbridge Town in the Preliminary Round. The following season they reached the First Qualifying Round, losing 3–0 at Clandown. Their best efforts in The FA Cup were in 1953–54 when they reached the Fourth Qualifying Round, losing 3–1 at Newport (IOW); and in 1955–56 when they defeated four clubs before losing 6–2 to Salisbury, again in the Fourth Qualifying Round. The club's last attempt in the competition was in 1961–62.

BDC Aero Puma

The BDC Aero Puma is a Canadian ultralight and light-sport aircraft, designed by the Italian aircraft designer Antonio Bortolanza and produced by BDC Aero Industrie of Lachute, Quebec. The aircraft is supplied as a 90% complete kit for amateur construction or as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.
Design and development.
The Puma was originally called the Pluto by Bortolanza when he first designed it in the mid-1980s. Later it was known as the "Drakken" (Swedish for "dragon") before being renamed Puma when production was moved to Canada in 2005.
The aircraft was redesigned from the original prototypes to comply with the Canadian Advanced Ultralight rules and US light-sport aircraft rules. It features a strut-braced high-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit with composite doors for access, fixed tricycle landing gear with wheel pants and a single engine in tractor configuration.
The aircraft is made with an aluminum wing and composite fuselage. Its span wing has an area of and flaps. Standard engines available are the Rotax 912UL and the Rotax 912ULS four-stroke powerplants. The factory-supplied kit is 90% complete and requires the builder to paint the airframe and procure and install the engine and instruments.
The Puma is an approved Transport Canada Advanced Ultralight, but, as of August 2012, does not appear on the Federal Aviation Administration light-sport aircraft list.
Operational history.
The Puma's manufacturer states "Many flying schools have adopted the PUMA as their training plane". In August 2012 there were four Pumas registered with Transport Canada and none registered in the United States.

Rockfel

Rockfel (1935–November 1941) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare, best known for winning two Classics in 1938. In a career which lasted from July 1937 until May 1939 she ran thirteen times and won eight races. Rockfel began her career at the lowest level, being beaten in a selling race, but improved to become recognised as one of the best British racemares of the 20th century. In 1938 she was the dominant three-year-old in England, winning the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket and the Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom. In the autumn she defeated colts in the Champion Stakes and the Aintree Derby and was retired after winning her only race as a four-year-old. She produced one foal before dying in November 1941.
Background.
Rockfel was a brown mare with a white blaze and three white socks, and was described in her prime as having "a very plain head and a light neck". She was sired by the Epsom Derby winner Felstead out of the mare Rockliffe who won ten minor races for her owner Lord Londonderry. The mating of Felstead and Rockliffe was arranged by Londonderry, who then sold the pregnant mare for 3,000 guineas to Felstead's owner Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen. The resulting filly was therefore officially bred by Cunliffe-Owen's Weir Park Stud.
Rockfel was sent into training with the Australian Oswald Marmaduke Dalby "Ossie" Bell at his Delamere House stable in Lambourn Berkshire. According to the Bloodstock Breeders' Review, Rockfel was an unusually intelligent and independent horse, leading to her being nicknamed "the old lady", by Bell's stable staff.
Racing career.
1937: two-year-old season.
Until 1946 there was no requirement for two-year-old British racehorses to have official names and the filly who became Rockfel remained unnamed throughout 1937. On her racecourse debut she finished unplaced in a selling race at Sandown Park in July. After finishing unplaced again she showed the first signs of ability when running third, beaten a head and a short head in a maiden race race at Newmarket Racecourse over six furlongs on 28 September. "The Rockliffe filly" won at the fourth attempt when taking the five furlong Askham Maiden Plate at York Racecourse on 7 October. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the season's best two-year-olds, she was given a weight of 108 pounds, twenty-five pounds below the top-rated Portmarnock and twenty-one pounds behind the leading filly Radiant.
1938: three-year-old season.
In the spring of 1938 Rockfel showed improved form to finish third in the Free Handicap over seven furlongs and then recorded her most important success up to that time when winning the Princess Elizabeth Stakes at Epsom. At Newmarket Rockfel started at odds of 8/1 for the 1000 Guineas against nineteen other fillies. Ridden by Sam Wragg she led from the start and after being briefly challenged by Laughing Water two furlongs from the finish she drew away to win comfortably by one and a half lengths from Laughing Water, with Solar Flower third.
In the Oaks a month later, Sam Wragg was replaced as her jockey by his brother Harry and Rockfel started 3/1 favourite. She led from the start and won by four lengths from Radiant with Solar Flower third. Her winning time of 2:37.00 was 1.5 seconds faster than that recorded by Bois Roussel when winning the Derby at the same meeting. Rockfel was brought back in distance for the one mile Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in which she failed when attempting to concede fourteen pounds to the winner Solar Flower. In the Hyperion Stakes at the next Ascot meeting Rockfel defeated Solar Flower for the third time in four meetings, this time conceding three pounds.
In October, Rockfel was tried against colts and older horses in the ten furlong Champion Stakes at Newmarket. Ridden again by Harry Wragg she won by five lengths from the 2000 Guineas winner Pasch, who had been strongly fancied to beat her. On her final start of the season she again raced against colts in the thirteen furlong Aintree Derby on November 10. She led from the start and accelerated away from her rivals in the closing stages, winning by three lengths from the Jockey Club Cup winner Foxglove and the St Leger runner-up Challenge. After the race the filly was escorted to the winner's enclosure by a "guard of honour" formed by cheering spectators. Wragg was reported to have described the filly as the best horse he had ever ridden, calling her a "perfect racing machine".
1939: four-year-old season.
Rockfel was kept in training at four and was aimed Ascot Gold Cup where she was expected to meet Bois Roussel. She began the season by easily winning the March Stakes at Newmarket in spring but then developed training problems and was retired to stud without racing again.
Assessment and honours.
At the end of 1938, Rockfel was rated equal with the Derby winner Bois Roussel, when both were assigned a weight of 133 pounds in the three-year-old version of the Free Handicap. Early in 1939 it was reported that she had been favourably compared to Pretty Polly and Sceptre.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Rockfel a "great" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks and the seventh best British-trained filly of the 20th century.
The Rockfel Stakes a Group Two race for two-year-old fillies at Newmarket was named in the mare's honour in 1981.
Stud record.
Rockfel's time at stud was brief: in November 1941 she became ill and died of a "twisted gut". Earlier that year she had produced her only foal, a colt sired by Hyperion. Named Rockefella, he won three races and sired the 2000 Guineas winner Rockavon and the leading Japanese sire China Rock. Rockefella was also the damsire of Sharpen Up, the sire of Pebbles, Kris, Diesis and Sharpo.

Sigma 8-16mm f/4.5-5.6 DC HSM lens

The Sigma 8-16mm lens is an enthusiast-level, ultra wide-angle rectilinear zoom lens made by Sigma Corporation specifically for use with APS-C small format digital SLRs. It is the first ultra wide rectilinear (non-fisheye lens) zoom lens with a minimum focal length of 8 mm, designed specifically for APS-C size image sensors. The lens was introduced at the February 2010 Photo Marketing Association International Convention and Trade Show. At its release it was the widest viewing angle focal length available commercially for APS-C cameras. It is part of Sigma's DC (Digital Camera) line of lenses, meaning it was designed to have an image circle tailored to work with APS-C format cameras. The lens has a constant length regardless of optical zoom and focus with inner lens tube elements responding to these parameters. The camera has hypersonic zoom autofocus.
The lens is sold in versions that fit the bayonet mounts of Nikon, Canon, Sigma, Sony/Minolta and Pentax APS-C cameras.
Specifications and measurements.
The lens measures and weighs . It has a bulb-like aspherical lens, similar to notable wide-angle and fisheye lenses such as the Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 14-24mm f/2.8G ED, Nikon AF DX Fisheye-Nikkor 10.5mm f/2.8G ED, or Tokina AT-X 107 DX AF 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 fisheye lens. Because of the shape of front element, it is not compatible with many filters, including UV filters, but the frontal exposure is rectified by a petal-shaped lens hood element. Because the lens has a permanent lens hood affixed, it comes with a friction-fit aluminum element, variously described as a sleeve, ring or shroud, that surrounds the hood to enable the placement of a front cap on the lens. "PC Magazine" Jim Fisher says the lens is relatively large and heavy; A reviewer at photozone.de says that for a wide-angle lens the dimensions are unusually narrow but long.
The sleeve is threaded, making it compatible with 72mm filters, but vignetting is severe with the sleeve in place. The construction is plastic although the lens' rear mount is metal. The distance meter is recessed inside a window, but no depth of field meter or infrared index is present. The 7/8" zoom ring is made of raised rubber ridges and operates over a 75 degree turning radius. The focus ring is similarly constructed with more closely spaced ridges and a 100 degrees of turning action. The ridges of both rings are parallel to the lens.
The only physical controls on the lens are the AF/MF toggle switch and the two rings, controlling the zoom and focus. The camera does not have image stabilization. This is common for wide-angle photography which can be performed well using hand-held techniques. Over the range of focal lengths, the minimum and maximum aperture vary.
Autofocus.
The lens features a hypersonic zoom motor for its autofocus, which is considered to be a fast and quiet design. In addition, manual override is allowed in the single-shot autofocus mode. The lens, which focuses internally, has one of the lowest maximum magnification measurements in its class (which includes the Canon 10-22mm, Sigma 10-20mm f/3.5, Sigma 10-20mm f/4–5.6 EX DC HSM lens, Tamron 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5 DI II Lens, Nikon 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5G ED AF-S DX lens and the Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX Lens). The lens' autofocus feature is not functional with Pentax ist* series and K100D DSLR cameras that do not support hypersonic zoom mechanics. The lens is capable of focusing from infinity to minimum focusing distance and back in under a second: so micro focusing is rapid. However, because of the narrow focus range (0.13x) the lens is not suitable for macro photography.
Distortion.
The lens exhibits significant distortion in keeping with the problems of wide-angle lenses. The complex barrel distortion is approximately 2.9% at 8 mm focal length but is fairly insignificant as the focal length is raised above 12 mm, according to Photozone.de. "PC Magazine" reports 3.1% distortion at 8 mm and 0.7% at 12 mm. It also reports that distortion switches to pincushion distortion of 1.4% at 16 mm. "SLAR Gear" reports that the point of convergence between barrel and pincushion is about 13 mm. Foreground subjects seem abnormally large compared to similar background subjects with this lens.
By combining the wide angle focal lengths with narrow apertures, the lens provides strong depth of field rather than making blurred backgrounds. The lens is constructed with a hybrid aspherical lens that when combined with two glass mold elements provides excellent correction for distortion as well as astigmatism.
Vignetting and field of view.
As all lens systems, natural vignetting (gradual reduction of an image's brightness from the center towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8 mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16 mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.
The lens is equipped with an full-frame digital SLR-compatible mount allowing the usage of both APS-C sized cameras and formats larger than APS-C – the build in lens hood however visibly restricts the field of view (FOV) on formats larger than APS-C – see example above. The FOV in APS-C sized cameras is further restricted at shorter focal lengths if the front cap adaptor ring is not removed – see example below.
Resolution.
The lens' modulation transfer function (MTF) metrics for its image resolution (sharpness) were described as "surprisingly impressive...throughout the entire zoom range" by Photozone.de. The sharpness, in terms of line widths per picture height (LW/PH), is most uniform at 8 mm (especially near the f-number of 8 where it is even throughout the image) with strong numbers at the center, borders and corner. Higher focal lengths were less impressive. Optical tests were consistent with lab results pointing to excellent sharpness. However, exposure testing seems to belie the stated f-number capabilities of the lens, since stopping down from widest aperture did not change results, according to Gietler.
At its widest aperture, the sharpness does not meet the 1800 threshold at either 8 mm (1572, f/4.5) or 12 mm (1356, f/5), but at 16 mm (f/5.6) it achieves over 2000 lines per picture height. However, stopping down improves the sharpness at all focal lengths, according to "PC Magazine". At 8 mm, 1800 is reached at f/8, while at 12 mm it is still only at 1509 by f/8. The image quality is asymmetric with better performance on the right side. At 8 mm and f/4.5, it has 1 blur unit in the center and 1.5 in the corners. Although the images are slightly sharper at f/5.6, "SLR Gear" claims sharpness declines significantly at f/11 to almost 2 blur units with further stopping down increasing blur to 3.5 at f/22. At the longer focal lengths for this lens, stopping down to f/29 yields a 5 blur unit result.
Chromatic aberration.
The lens is the first that incorporated Sigma's FLD glass elements, designed to correct color aberrations like fluoride glass does. Chromatic aberrations are indeed superior to earlier Sigma wide-angle lenses. In fact, although they might be noticeable at 100% image magnification, they are not at the magnifications now common with prints relative to the number of megapixels that images are commonly captured at. According to Sigma's website, Super Multi-Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting. As one zooms out with this lens chromatic aberration becomes significant at the corners.
Action photography.
The aperture stop-down focal lengths make the lens a laggard among wide-angle lenses. Thus, it is not strong at gathering light for stop action photography. However, DSLR cameras have improved at higher ISO settings. However, wide-angle photography (below 16mm) continues to need stronger lighting than is possible by built in flashes if trying to make up for low light situations.
Close focus and macro.
At 8 mm and 16 mm, respectively, the lens is able to focus on an area and in width. Although the official close focus distance is , Scott Gietler reported that by using the spot-focus mode, rather than multiple focus points, he was able to achieve a minimum working distance (glass to subject).
Critical commentary.
The lens is useful for deliberative shots by landscape photographers and other skilled artists. The challenge of the vast field of view may be overcome by some casual users. Car photographers benefit from the new perspective of this lens. The lens was a 2010 "American Photo" Editor's Choice.

Charles Richardson (civil engineer)

Sir Charles Richardson (1814-1896) was the resident engineer of the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. He was also the instigator and first engineer of the Severn Tunnel.
Early life.
Richardson was born at Capenhurst Hall in Cheshire. He was educated in England and France. His father, Richard, died when he was six. Despite an early sporting talent for cricket, it was now clear that he would need to make his own living and so, encouraged by his mother, he followed his other talent for engineering.
He attended Edinburgh University from 1833, reading Mathematics.
Early career.
He was taken as a pupil by Marc Brunel, working with him on the Thames Tunnel. From then he worked with the Brunels on a number of railway projects, particularly involving tunnelling. These included Box Tunnel and Sapperton Tunnel.
Richardson was noted for his interest in cricket. This led to some conflict with Brunel over disruptions to his work, although equally it was encouraged by other contractors as an alternative to the evils of drink.
In 1858 Brunel appointed Richardson as the resident engineer of the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. This work involved railway lines and tunnels, but also two large piers at New Passage and Portskewett. These piers included floating pontoons to cope with the enormous tidal range of the Severn estuary.
Severn Tunnel.
During the completion of the ferry piers, around 1863, Richardson began to advocate an underwater tunnel as a better means of joining the Bristol and South Wales lines. Plans for bridges were also afoot at this time, a long viaduct from Oldbury, never built, and also the Severn Railway Bridge further upstream.
In November 1871, the first plans for the tunnel were deposited with Parliament. The Act was obtained in 1872 and work began in 1873. The consulting engineer for this project was John Hawkshaw with Alfred Gooch as Richardson's assistant. The first contractor for the tunnel works was Rowland Brotherhood, with whom Richardson had previously worked on the Wharncliffe Viaduct at Hanwell.
Daniel Gooch later appears dissatisfied with Richardson's work and in May 1878 described him in his diary thus, "Richardson, the engineer, has no go in him and does not move without consulting me, making me almost the engineer."
Work on the tunnel progressed well and by 17 October 1879 the two headings from each side of the river were within 138 yards of joining up. This was the date of the opening of the nearby Severn Railway Bridge, which Gooch attended as chairman of the GWR and had invited the guests present to view the even more impressive tunnel with the ironic warning, "It will be rather wet and you had better bring your umbrellas". On the 18th, a massive inflow of water had broken into the tunnel, from an unexpected direction in one of the landward tunnels on the Welsh side, entirely flooding the workings. Tunnelling would be repeatedly disrupted by this water for several years, even after the tunnel was first drained and tunnelling work began again in 1881. Hawkshaw rapidly replaced Richardson as chief engineer. Within two months, Thomas Walker, who had originally tendered for the construction of the tunnel, was appointed as the new contractor. The tunnel did not finally open until 1886, after much effort and innovation in both pumping and in working underwater.
During his time at Sudbrook, Richardson continued with his interest in cricket. This led to his invention of the modern cricket bat, with its cane-spliced handle.

The Cheng cycle is a retrofit to the gas turbine cycle. The Cheng cycle involves the heated exhaust gas from the turbine being used to make steam in a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The steam so produced is injected into the gas turbine's combustion chamber to increase power output. The process can be thought of as a parallel combination of the gas turbine Brayton cycle and a steam turbine Rankine cycle. The cycle was invented by Prof. D. Y. Cheng of the University of Santa Clara who patented it in 1976.

He joined the Merchant Navy at age 15 in 1939 and transferred to the Royal Navy Reserve in 1941 as a midshipman. Lenton was promoted to sub-lieutenant by the end of that year and he was a lieutenant aboard the light cruiser in 1944. That same year he volunteered for service in the Royal Indian Navy and was commanding the auxiliary patrol vessel "Oostkapelle" in 1945.

Jericho Shinde

Jericho Shinde is a Zambian coach and former footballer. Nicknamed ‘Tanker,’ he was a star player for Rhokana United, (later Nkana Red Devils, now Nkana F.C.) winning four league titles and was also a linchpin in Zambia’s midfield in the eighties. After retirement, Shinde coached Nkana, Kalulushi Modern Stars and Power Dynamos.
Playing career.
Shinde was still a student at Kitwe’s Chamboli Secondary School when he made his debut for Rhokana as a 17 year old in 1977. He initially played on the left side of midfield, and he made his international debut in August 1981 at the age of 21 in a CAN qualifier against Morocco in Rabat, when he preplaced the injured Alex Chola in a match which Zambia lost 2-1 but won the return leg 2-0 to book a ticket to CAN 82.
By this time, Shinde was playing in a central midfield position and though he was a deep-lying midfielder for the national team, he assumed a more attack-minded role for his club, wearing the number 10 shirt for the Red Devils. He was part of Zambia’s team at CAN 1982 and was the star performer as Rhokana now rechristened Nkana Red Devils won the inaugural Premier league title in 1982 without losing a single game, and three more titles in 1983, 1985 and 1986. He was part of Zambia’s CECAFA winning team in December 1984 in Uganda, scoring a goal against Tanzania in the group stage.
Shinde was at his best when Zambia defeated Cameroun 4-1 in a World Cup qualifier in 1985 in Lusaka, bossing the midfield to telling effect. He was in the team that defeated Nigeria 1-0 on aggregate to qualify to CAN 1986 and he featured at the tournament where Zambia did not make it past the group stage. He played his last game for Zambia against Malawi in an All Africa Games Qualifier in April 1987. In his last game for the Zambia national team, he suffered a knee-injury that ended his playing career pre-maturely-the untold story.
Coaching career.
He took up coaching in the early 1990s first at Nkana as one of the assistants under Moses Simwala after which he coached another Zambian Premier League side Kalulushi Modern Stars. Shinde then moved to Nkana’s bitter rivals, defending league champions Power Dynamos in 1995, replacing Webby Chilufya who had left for a coaching course in Europe. 
When Dynamos recorded some indifferent results in the league, Shinde had a traumatic experience when fans blamed him for the team’s performances and one of them went as far as following him to his home and pulling a gun on him. 
When Power surrendered their title to Mufulira Wanderers at the end of the season, Shinde was dismissed and Chilufya reassumed coaching duties and declared that if he had been in charge throughout the season, Dynamos would not have lost the league. Shinde gave no response until a year later when Chilufya was fired at the end of the 1996 season when Dynamos finished third, 19 points behind champions Wanderers. He had the last word, saying that he hoped Chilufya had learnt a lesson, that there were ups and downs in the coaching job.
Shinde later coached Nkana, Afrisport FC and Botswana side TAFIC F.C. but is currently unattached.

Dan West (athlete)

Daniel "Dan" West (born 15 December 1977) is a Paralympian athlete from England competing mainly in category 34 throwing events. He has represented Great Britain in four Paralympic Games and has qualified for the team for a fifth time at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. West has two bronze Paralympic medals and one silver, all in the shot put, and has medalled in the IPC World Championships and the Commonwealth Games.
Life history.
West was born in Cambridge, England in 1977. West, who has cerebral palsy, credits his parents for instilling in him a love of sport, and in his younger days engaged in both wheelchair basketball and swimming. He switched to athletics as a teenager, citing a preference to individual sports, and took to the throwing events, specialising in both the discus and shot put. 
West was selected at the age of 18 to represent Great Britain in the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta at both shot and discus. He finished 8th in discus but his third place in the shot put saw him collect the bronze medal. Despite the medal, West, who was the world number one in the shot going into the games, saw his result as a disappointment and spurred him to improve his training. Two years later he was again representing Great Britain, this time at the World Championships, and again it was his shot that was the stronger of the two events, collecting the silver medal. In 2000 West was reselected for the Paralympics, again entering the shot and discus. He again won a bronze medal, but this time in the discus. 
In 2002, another World Championship resulted in another two medals, silver in the shot put and bronze in the discus. With a shot put bronze in the European Games in 2003, West was selected for his third Paralympics, in Athens. His third Paralympics saw him pick up his third medal, this time a silver in the discus. In 2006 he competed in his most successful event picking up silver in both events at the World Championships in Assen in the Netherlands. In the World Championships West threw a personal best of 38.16m in the discus, only to be beaten to the gold when Saleh Farajzadeh of Iran thre a new world record of 39.98.
West was selected for his fourth Paralympics in 2008, again entering under both sports. West stated in a 2011 interview that the Beijing games were a bad competition and he failed to medal at the games for the first time. On returning to Britain he changed coach, initially teaming up with Mark Edwards in Loughborough before moving training camp to work with Jim Edwards. In a bid to win a gold medal in the 2012 Paralympics, Edwards advised West to concentrate just on the shot put for the London games. The decision appeared to make a difference with West picking up a gold in the shot put in the 2009 Paralympic World Cup, a silver in the 2010 Commonwealth Games and then in the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships he threw a personal best of 11.37m, only to be beaten to the gold by another World record throw, of 11.53m by Thierry Cibone of France. 
In 2012 West was selected for his fifth Paralympics, this time only in the shot put, in London.

Oklahoma State University School of Fire Protection and Safety

The School of Fire Protection and Safety at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma has been home to one of the few fire protection programs in the North America since its creation in 1937.
The founders of the program saw a need to train personnel in the field of fire protection. Filling that need over the years lead to the creation of: The School of Fire Protection, the publishing of the famous Oklahoma Redbooks and the creation of the International Fire Service Training Association (IFSTA) and Fire Protection Publications (FPP), the establishment of Oklahoma Fire Service Training (FST) and the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress (IFSAC) and the College of Engineering Architecture and Technology (CEAT) outreach extension program.
Together these entities form the fire and safety education program of Oklahoma State University, which has earned the status of, "Standard Quality in the Profession," in 2010 by James Shannon, President of NPFA, along with being dubbed a, "National treasure...its work is of great national importance," by Honorable Adair Wakefield Margo of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities.
History.
In 1937 the then-named Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College opened the Department of Firemanship Training with a two-year associates degree program. In the late 1940's the curriculum shifted toward industrial fire protection rather than municipal firefighting. In the 1960's the name of the program changed to Fire Protection. In 1973 it became a four-year bachelor degree program, Fire Protection and Safety Engineering Technology.
Outreach Programs.
Oklahoma State University Fire Service Training.
Oklahoma Fire Service Training (OFST) is an extension/outreach unit of Oklahoma State University's College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology (CEAT). OFST has legislative mandate to train Oklahoma's emergency responder's, and provides Oklahoma emergency responders a broad spectrum of training ranging from the basic skills to more advanced specialized topics. This training occurs at the OFST Professional Skills Center located six miles west of Stillwater, Oklahoma and across the state of Oklahoma at any of the nine hundred plus Fire Departments.
OFST's long-standing commitment of service to Oklahoma paid and volunteer firefighters now extends to emergency responders outside of this traditional realm. In January 1997, OFST created the Industrial Section to serve emergency responders in commercial, industrial, institutional, and governmental entities. From Industrial fire brigade fundamentals, to more advanced topics in fire, rescue, incident management, industrial medic, hazardous materials and response to terrorism, OFST takes innovative market-oriented approaches to serve industry's emerging demands for first responder training.
The OFST Certification Section has achieved International Fire Service Accreditation Congress (IFSAC) accreditation in fifteen technical levels. IFSAC accredited certification gives reasonable assurance of the content and quality of the testing program offered by OFST.

Antiproton Accumulator

The Antiproton Accumulator (AA) was part of the antiparticle factory at CERN designed to decelerate and store antimatter, to study the properties of antimatter and to create atoms of antihydrogen. It was built at the end of the 70's in order to produce and accumulate high energy antiprotons to feed into the SPS in order to transform it into a "proton-antiproton collider". In 1986 it was expanded by the Antiproton Collector to greatly increase the production of antiprotons. It was decommissioned along with the rest of the antiparticle factory in 1996.
Low energy antiproton research continues at CERN using the Antiproton Decelerator which started operation in 2000.

Trinity-Antonian Cricket Encounter

Trinity-Antonian Cricket Encounter (known as "Kandy's Battle of the Blues") is the annual school cricket match (Big Match) played between Trinity College, Kandy and St. Anthony's College, Kandy played since 1914. It is considered as one of the oldest annual school cricket encounters in Sri Lanka. This encounter is being played for the John Halangoda Memorial Trophy and it is awarded to the team who manages to win the match by means of an outright win or at least a first innings win. The winner of the limited over cricket encounter, usually played a week after the 2-day match, will be awarded the Sir Richard Aluwihare Trophy.
History.
<br>
The first encounter was played on the Bogambara Grounds in March 1914; the Antonians won. Trinity won the next match, and a long-contested series has followed.
1918 to 1929 during the World War I St. Anthony's College premises including practice pitches and playing-fields were occupied by British Army. As a result Antonian cricket deprived and they had lost to Trinity for 11 times consecutively.If Antoian premises not occupied by British Army Antonian can easily win those matches.Because in that period anthony's has brilliant players like Jack Anderson.But antonians doesn't have a ground to practice.
The period 1929-1947 was inauspicious for the Antonians, especially the post-war period. Trinity during that time had in C. Dharmalingam a left-arm bowler who for two consecutive years nagged the Antonians with his left-arm spin, in (1938) he took 9 for 14 and in (1939) had the figures of 6 for 17 and 6 for 31 inclusive of a double hat-trick, a world record. 
Then there was T. B. Werapitiya with scores of 100 in (1943) and 143 in (1944) the highest score made by a Trinitian. Meanwhile the Antonians getting back their premises, with facilities restored and having the services of a renowned cricket coach in Mr. John Halangoda came back fighting and in 1947 the Antonians nearly humbled the Trinitians at Asgiriya. Unusually, the strong Trinity batting line-up crumbled under the spin bowling of Dicky Dunuwille, the Antonian mystery bowler who was later responsible in changing the fortunes of Antonian cricket. Antonians however lost the match by 68 runs due to a spectacular performance in good fielding where seven close-in-catches were grabbed by Trinity's Clarence Senanayake to dismiss the Antonians. 
The Antonians won the very next encounter (1948) at Katugastota where Dicky Dunuwilla taking 6 for 10 once again mesmerized the Trinitians and the Antonians since then have not looked back. During the period 1947-1997 Trinity has registered four wins as against the Antonian tally of eight wins. Most Antonian victories (11) in the series have been registered during the period. 
A disagreement between the two schools, regarding the age rule resulted in the cancellation of the match in 1956 and 1957. Also, in 2001 the match did not play as the Trinity stopped playing mid way during that season due to disciplinary reasons.

<doc id="36842278" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36842278" title="Regional Trial Court">
Regional Trial Court

The Regional Trial Courts (RTC) are the highest trial courts in the Philippines.
History.
It was formerly called as the Court of First Instance since the Spanish era. It continued throughout its colonization under Spanish and Americans. After the Independence from the United States, Republic Act No. 296 or Judiciary Act of 1948 was enacted to reinforce its jurisdictional powers of the Court of First Instance. Under its law, it has the power to try civil and criminal cases, as well as appeals from the decisions made by the municipality and city Justice of the Peace courts.
However, there were numerous cases (both civil and criminal) yet to resolved or being delayed for years due to its nature. In addition, there were special courts made to try specialized cases like criminal, agricultural, and family to decongest cases, which unfortunately ended up complicating the judiciary system. Therefore, the Interim Batasang Pambansa has passed Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, or The Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, which reorganized the lower and intermediate courts in the country, which include the change of Court of First Instance to Regional Trial Court.
Jurisdiction.
Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, or The Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, and Republic Act No. 7691, or An Act Expanding the Jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts of 1994, as amended, gave the RTCs the following jurisdiction:
Civil.
(1) In all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation;
(2) In all civil actions which involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein, where the assessed value of the property involved exceeds Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000,00) or, for civil actions in Metro Manila, where such value exceeds Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) except actions for forcible entry into and unlawful detainer of lands or buildings, original jurisdiction over which is conferred upon the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts.
(3) In all actions in admiralty and maritime jurisdiction where the demand or claim exceeds One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) or, in Metro Manila, where such demand or claim exceeds Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00).
(4) In all matters of probate, both testate and intestate, where the gross value of the estate exceeds One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) or, in probate matters in Metro Manila, where such gross value exceeds Two Hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00).
(5) In all actions involving the contract of marriage and marital relations.
(6) In all cases not within the exclusive jurisdiction of any court, tribunal, person or body exercising jurisdiction of any court, tribunal, person or body exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions.
(7) In all civil actions and special proceedings falling within the exclusive original jurisdiction of a Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court and of the Court of Agrarian Relations as now provided by law.
(8) In all other cases in which the demand, exclusive of interest, damages of whatever kind, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs or the value of the property in controversy exceeds One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) or, in such other cases in Metro Manila, where the demand exclusive of the abovementioned items exceeds Two Hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00).
Criminal.
Regional Trial Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction in all criminal cases not within the exclusive jurisdiction of any court, tribunal or body, except those now falling under the exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan which shall hereafter be exclusively taken cognizance of by the latter. RTC Criminal Courts typically try cases of serious crimes like murder and robbery, as opposed to petty crimes, which reduce the burden of court cases.
Original and Special Jurisdiction.
Regional Trial Courts shall exercise original jurisdiction:
(1) In the issuance of writs of certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus and injunction which may be enforced in any part of their respective regions.
(2) In actions affecting ambassadors and other public ministers and consuls.
The Supreme Court may designate certain branches of the Regional Trial Courts to handle exclusively criminal cases, juvenile and domestic relations cases, agrarian cases, urban land reform cases which do not fall under the jurisdiction of quasi-judicial bodies and agencies, and/or such other special cases as the Supreme Court may determine in the interest of a speedy and efficient administration of justice.
Appeals from lower courts.
Regional Trial Courts shall exercise appellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts in their respective territorial jurisdictions. Such cases shall be decided on the basis of the entire record of the proceedings had in the court of origin and such memoranda and/or briefs as may be submitted by the parties or required by the Regional Trial Courts. The decision of the Regional Trial Courts in such cases shall be appealable by petition for review to the Court of Appeals which may give it due course only when the petition shows prima facie that the lower court has committed an error of fact or law that will warrant a reversal or modification of the decision or judgment sought to be reviewed.
List.
Pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 or Judicial Reorganization Act of 1980, each province or city (in case of Metro Manila cities and other Philippine cities, chartered by law) should have a Regional Trial Court (RTC) branch. The Congress can make another RTC branch, when necessary by a Republic Act.

Gene Rondo

Winston Lara (28 May 1943 – 12 June 1994), better known by his stage name Gene Rondo, was a Jamaican reggae singer. After first recording as part of the duo Gene & Roy in Jamaica, he relocated to London where he continued to record until the 1980s, including several album releases in the 1970s, both solo and as a member of The Undivided. He was sometimes credited as Gene Laro or Winston Laro.
Biography.
Born in Greenwich Farm, Kingston, Jamaica in 1943, Rondo entered the music business in the late 1950s, successfully competing in the "Vere Johns Opportunity Hour" talent content with his partner Satch. He recorded a single in Jamaica as part of the duo Gene & Roy ("Little Queenie"/"Squeeze Me"), before relocating to London in 1962, where he studied as a classical singer in Hammersmith.
In 1965 he formed the band Abashack, with whom he toured the UK, and went on to record singles on the Giant and Jolly labels of Stamford Hill-based R&B Records in 1968. He then recorded for Dandy Livingstone's Trojan Records sub-label Downtown, releasing several singles in 1969 and 1970. In 1970 he recorded his debut album, "On My Way", for Trojan. He went on to record for Magnet Records, including contributing four tracks to the "Reggae Desire" album in 1974.
In 1972 he formed the pop-reggae band The Undivided (which later evolved into Undivided Roots), who released an album ("Listen to the World") for Decca. He also recorded as a solo reggae vocalist for several UK-based producers including Clement Bushay, Dennis Harris (for whom he recorded duets with T.T. Ross), and Count Shelly. Rondo accompanied Susan Cadogan for her performance of "Hurt So Good" on "Top of the Pops".
In the mid-1970s, Rondo adopted the Rastafari faith, and recorded more roots-oriented tracks such as "A Land Far Away" and "Give All the Parise to Jah". Rondo co-produced (with Bunny Lee) Delroy Wilson's "Nice Times" album in 1983 and contributed backing vocals to Alton Ellis's "25th Silver Jubilee" album in 1984. He continued to record into the 1980s, and also set up the Roots Pool community centre and studio in North London. He was a major contributor to the British Reggae Artists Famine Appeal (BRAFA) and the charity single "Let's Make Africa Green Again", which raised funds for the Save the Children Fund. He continued to concentrate on community work in the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s.
Rondo died from cancer in St Josephs Hospice, Hackney in June 1994. A memorial concert was held featuring artists such as Alton Ellis, Prince Lincoln, Justin Hinds, Dennis Alcapone, Owen Gray, and Carroll Thompson.

Brauer–Wall group

In mathematics, the Brauer–Wall group or super Brauer group or graded Brauer group for a field "F" is a group BW("F") classifying finite-dimensional graded central division algebras over the field. It was first defined by as a generalization of the Brauer group.
The Brauer group of a field "F" is the set of the similarity classes of finite dimensional central simple algebras over "F" under the operation of tensor product, where two algebras are called similar if the commutants of their simple modules are isomorphic. Every similarity class contains a unique division algebra, so the elements of the Brauer group can also be identified with isomorphism classes of finite dimensional central division algebras. The analogous construction for Z/2Z-graded algebras defines the Brauer–Wall group BW("F").

Archipelagic state

An archipelagic state is any internationally recognized state or country that comprises a series of islands that form an archipelago. The term is defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in order to define what borders such states should be allowed to claim.
In various conferences of the United Nations on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Fiji, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Bahamas, and the Philippines are the five sovereign states that obtained approval in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) held in Montego Bay, Jamaica on December 10, 1982 and qualified as archipelagic states. 
Archipelagic states are states that are composed of groups of islands forming a state as a single unit, with the islands and the waters within the baselines as internal waters. Under this concept ("archipelagic doctrine"), an archipelago shall be regarded as a single unit, so that the waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, irrespective of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the state, and are subject to its exclusive sovereignty.
The approval of the United Nations for the five sovereign states as archipelagic states respect existing agreements with other countries and shall recognize traditional fishing rights and other legitimate activities of the immediately adjacent neighboring countries in certain areas falling within archipelagic waters. The terms and conditions for the exercise of such rights and activities, including the nature, the extent and the areas to which they apply, shall, at the request of any of the countries concerned, be regulated by bilateral agreements between them. Such rights shall not be transferred to or shared with third countries or their nationals.

Pen-y-Fal Hospital

Pen-y-Fal Hospital was a psychiatric hospital in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, opened in 1851 and closed in 1996. It held up to 1,170 patients at its peak.
The facility went under a variety of names:
Pen-y-Fal was designed initially to house 250 patients. Its architect, Thomas Fulljames of Gloucester, assisted by Frederick Sandham Waller, chose the Tudor Gothic style using local old red sandstone with Bath stone dressings to animate its charming gathering of gables and chimneys. The property was set in grounds of 75 acres reflecting the medical thinking that outdoor space was an important aspect of treatment. There was an asylum farm which provided food for the hospital.
The Joint Counties Lunatic Asylum was established as a result of the County Asylums Act 1845, which laid down the regulation of lunatic asylums at a county level nationwide. Initially Monmouthshire, Herefordshire, Radnorshire and Breconshire joined together in supporting the Abergavenny facility, though as the population grew, individual asylums were built. Hence in 1897 the name was changed to Monmouthshire Lunatic Asylum. 
In 1884 a private coal and stores siding was laid from the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway.
It initially had twelve wards and 210 inmates. The Infirmary wing was added in 1859-61. The Laundry block was added in 1861-75. Further extensions were added in the 1880's, including the re-modelling of the main central elevation. The majority of the stone rear ranges dated from 1881-83 including the Central Administration Block and the Epileptic Block. The Working Men's Dormitory was added in 1891 by Alfred Swash and further work was done in 1901-4 and 1910.
Between 1851 and 1950 over 3,000 patients died at the hospital. A memorial plaque for the deceased has now been placed at the site.
Following closure the site had fallen into considerable disrepair. The Grade II Listed Building has been converted into luxury accommodation by Redrow plc. The main building frontage was preserved (now known as Sarno Square), but to the rear the property and grounds were significantly redeveloped.
There is a small brass memorial to the men of the staff of the hospital who died during the Great War. It was removed from Pen y Fal when the facility was converted into apartments and was dedicated at St. Mary’s Priory Church, Abergavenny on Palm Sunday 1998.
The asylum chapel built in the 1880s remains in a disused state on the site, with planning permission to be converted to luxury housing. The last burials here were in 1948 when the hospital came under the management of the NHS.

Carbactinoceras

Carbactinoceras is an Early Carboniferas (Visean) actincoceroid first found in Europe (Germany) related to "Rayonnoceras" but probably smaller.
Description.
"Carbactinoceras" shells are straight and generally unknown beyond the early growth stage. The siphuncle is large, central to subcentral; segments inflated, septal necks cyrochoantiic and recumbent. The endosiphuncular canal system observed is well developed with thin radial canals perpendicular to the central canal, and leading to a narrow seam along the connecting rings called a perispatium.
Taxomonic position.
Although "Carbactinoceras" had been considered an actinocerid according to the American Teatise Part K, 1964, based on the internal characters of the siphuncle, the initial chambers of the phragmocone indicate that this genus is an actinoceroid homeomorph (lookalike) belonging phylogenetically to the Pseudorthocerida

William Michael Mathes (April 15, 1936 – August 13, 2012) was an American historian and academic, who focused on the histories of Mexico and Spain. Mathes was a leading expert on the history of Baja California. His articles can be found in the "Journal of San Diego History" and other publications.
Career.
Mathes, an alumnus of the University of New Mexico, was a former professor of history at the University of San Francisco. In 1985, the Mexican government awarded him the Order of the Aztec Eagle, the highest decoration bestowed on foreign citizens. The government of Spain also awarded Mathes the Order of Isabella the Catholic in November 2005. Mathes received the Order of Isabella the Catholic at the "International Colloquium of El Camino Real -- Mexico Norte y Texas" conference at the University of Texas campus in San Antonio, Texas.
Mathes was also the director of Biblioteca Mathes near Guadalajara, Jalisco. He donated an extensive collection of manuscripts and books to the El Colegio de Jalisco in Zapopan and the collection is now called the Biblioteca Mathes.
Mathes spearheaded fundraising efforts for CAREM, a non-profit historical society based in Tecate, Baja California, which promotes the history of Baja California. Mathes efforts supported CAREM's led to the construction of its museum in Tecate; the organization named the museum's media room in honor of CAREM. CAREM supported Mathes' work, including his most recent "The Land of Calafia: A Brief History of Baja California". He is also credited with persuading the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH), the Mexican government bureau charged with preservation and research, to open a new regional office in Mexicali, so the historical sites and artifacts from Baja California would not have to be sent to an existing INAH office in Sonora.
As of 2012, Mathes was working jointly with the INAH, CAREM and the Ministry of Tourism of Baja California to potentially obtain UNESCO World Heritage status for the El Camino Real de las Californias, a Spanish mission trail spanning Baja California and California.
Mathes died in Lubbock, Texas, on August 13, 2012, at the age of 76. His death was reported in the Tijuana based Frontera newspaper by historian Mario Ortiz Villacorta. At the time of his death, Mathes was scheduled to deliver a presentation called "From Sinaloa and Sonora: the Families of the First Soldiers in Alta California" at the sixth meeting of the Early San Diego Regional History Conference on October 27, 2012. He is survived by one child, a daughter, Ann M. Mathes (Annie). She currently resides in California and is pursuing her A.S. Degree in Veterinary Technology.

A well-known microdensitometer, used in the photographic industry, is a granularity instrument or granularity machine. The granularity measurement involves the use of an optical aperture, 10-50 micrometers in diameter, and in the recording of thousands of optical density readings. The standard deviation of this series of measurements is known as the "granularity" of the measured transmission surface, optical film, or photographic film, in particular .
An alternative version to the traditional point-by-point microdensitometer is the beam expanded laser microdensitometer This instrument can illuminate simultaneously an area a few centimeters wide with an ultra thin height, in the micrometer regime. Advantages include increased depth of focus, significant increases in data collection speed, and superior signal to noise ratios. In microscopy applications, this type of ultra thin beam-expanded illumination can also be known as light sheet illumination or selective plane illumination.
This measurement technique, using ultra-thin expanded laser beams, is particularly useful to detect microscopic imperfections in optical coatings or transmission optical surfaces.

Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche

Prior to his birth on 30 June 1965, Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche (Tibetan: ཟུར་མང་གར་དབང་རིན་པོ་ཆེ་, Wylie: zur mang gar dbang rin po che) was recognized by the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa as the twelfth incarnation of the Gharwang Tulkus. He is the supreme lineage holder of the Zurmang Ear Whispered Lineage (zur mang snyan rgyud).
The unbroken line of the Gharwang Tulkus begins in the 14th century with the siddha Trung Mase, the first Gharwang Tulku and founder of the Zurmang Kagyu tradition and Zurmang Monastery. He was identified by the Fifth Gyalwa Karmapa, Deshin Shegpa as the omniscient emanation of the Indian mahasiddha Tilopa. This was believed to be the fulfillment of Tilopa’s prediction made after he received teachings directly from Vajrayogini in the Western land of Uddiyana, in which he had pledged to return to spread these teachings widely, after they had been transmitted through thirteen successive lineage holders. Before Tilopa’s return this set of teachings was to be limited to a one to one transmission from each lineage holder to the next, and only upon Tilopa’s later emanation as the first Gharwang Tulku were they opened up to a larger audience. These teachings form the core of the Zurmang Ear Whispered Lineage (zur mang snyan rgyud) also known as the Dakini Ear Whispered Lineage (mkha’ ‘gro snyan rgyud).
Recognition.
Rinpoche was born a prince of the Sikkimese Royal Court. His uncle was then the reigning King of Sikkim. However, even before his birth the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa identified him as the 12th Zurmang Gharwang. The Karmapa, who had alluded to his attendants that the next incarnation of Zurmang Gharwang would soon occur, was attending a performance of traditional Tibetan drama on the forecourt of Rumtek Monastery. During the Tilopa dance, a Jewel offering was made to the Karmapa, and breaking with tradition, instead of accepting it himself he directed that the gift be given to the Gharwang Tulku. So saying, he pointed to the surprised mother-to-be and announced that she was carrying the 12th Gharwang Rinpoche.
A few months later, the Royal Princess delivered her predicted son at her residence in Gangtok. At dawn Rinpoche’s parents had dispatched a messenger to go to Rumtek 24km away to inform the Karmapa of the new arrival. However, before the messenger could leave the house, Saljay Rinpoche, the Karmapa’s emissary, with a party of monks was already at the door, bearing gifts and a letter containing the Karmapa’s blessings for the newborn child. At the time the new tulku was born, the mother of the previous Gharwang, living in Tibet, was heard joyously announcing that, "Rinpoche had returned. He is born in a warm country where fruits and flowers grow in abundance, and in the midst of bird song."
Enthronement.
In 1976, shortly after his eleventh birthday, Gharwang Rinpoche was installed on the Lion Throne as the Twelfth Zurmang Gharwang. The ceremony took place in the Assembly Hall of the Dharma Chakra Center in the presence of the Sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa. It was attended by many incarnate tulkus, monks, and state dignitaries. Hundreds of well-wishers and devotees came to witness the event. During the ceremonial installation, the Karmapa gave Gharwang Rinpoche his name, "Karma Gharwang Chochung Tenpa Namgyal Thinley Kunkhyab Pal Zangpo," which means The Victorious Protector of Buddha Dharma With Excellent Qualities and All-Pervasive, Auspicious Activities. The Karmapa also predicted the founding of a new Zurmang Kagyu monastery outside Tibet which would become an important center for the teaching and practice of the Buddha Dharma.
Education.
In the years following his enthronement, Gharwang Rinpoche received many personal empowerments, textual transmissions, as well as oral instructions directly from his root lama, the Sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa. After Gyalwa Karmapa died, Gharwang Rinpoche studied at the Nalanda Buddhist Institute between 1981 and 1991, and graduated as the top student in the year of 1991.
Among his teachers were Kalu Rinpoche, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, Khenchen Pema Pedtse Rinpoche, Shamarpa, Situpa, and Gyaltsapa, and Buddhist scholars such as Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, Khenchen Tsultrim Gyamtso, Khenchen Chodak Tenphel, Khenpo Chokden, and Khenpo Tenzin Phuntsok.
Activities.
In 1987, while still an undergraduate, Gharwang Rinpoche began his teaching career at the Nalanda Buddhist Institute. Since then, he has taught extensively in dharma centers all over the world, in Europe, America, as well as in Asia. Zurmang centers can now be found in Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
In 1990 the Mayor of Los Angeles honored him with the Key to the City, making him an honorary citizen of the USA.
In August 1991 Gharwang Rinpoche returned for the first time to his original Seat in Zurmang Kham, (Qinghai province). He personally blessed the many people who came to greet him, and presented gifts to the people of Qinghai, including a towering gold-plated Buddha 15 feet high, a golden dharma wheel flanked by two listening deer, and a khengere (a bell-shaped object symbolizing the ever flourishing dharma, which is traditionally placed on the roof of a monastery). He encouraged and contributed to welfare projects throughout the region. In the same year, Rinpoche established the Zurmang Kagyu Buddhist Foundation. He initiated many community projects such as the construction of roads, schools, medical dispensaries, orphanages, and homes for the elderly.
In 1992 Gharwang Rinpoche commenced the construction of a new Seat for the Zurmang Kagyu Tradition in Lingdum, Sikkim. The site covers approximately 21 acres of forested slope on the same hill occupied by Rumtek. In under four years, he built a monastic complex, fulfilling the prediction of the Sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa of a new Zurmang Kagyu monastery outside Tibet.

The Story of Nastagio Degli Onesti, part one

The Story of Nastagio Degli Onesti, part one is a painting in tempera on wood by Sandro Botticelli, dated 1483. It measures 83 x 138 cm and is held in the Prado in Madrid.
History.
The picture is one of a series of four, possibly commissioned by Lorenzo the Magnificent in 1483 to donate to Giannozzo Pucci on the occasion of his wedding to Lucrezia Bini that year. The four were held in the Palazzo Pucci in Florence until 1868, when they were sold. The first three are now in the Prado, and the last one is now in original location after having spent some time in the Watney Collection in Charlbury, Oxfordshire, England.
Description and style.
The story of Nastagio degli Onesti, a nobleman of Ravenna, is the eighth tale of the fifth day in The Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio. This theme was chosen for its happy ending to a love affair, in which the daughter of Paolo Traversari, who rejects Nastagio's courting, changes her mind after witnessing the infernal punishment of another woman guilty the same sin of ingratitude towards her lover.
The first episode of the story is set in a pine wood around Ravenna, the city where the story takes place. Nastagio has left the city, disappointed by his unreturned affection, and wanders alone and sorrowful. He is surprised by the sudden appearance of a woman being chased by a knight and his dogs, which seize her in their teeth in spite of Nastagio's attempts to defend her.
On the left in the painting are some tents, in which Nastagio (in the red hose) is seen being advised by his friends to leave town for a while. Then Nastagio is shown in close-up, roaming the forest. He appears again nearby with a stick, seeking to drive away the dogs that are trying to bite a half-naked woman, chased by a dashing knight with a sword and golden armour.
The scene has a strong narrative character, showing successive scenes within one picture and requiring three representations of Nastagio, a typically late medieval procedure. The tall, upright trunks of the trees combine with the horizontal seascape in the background to form a kind of grid, giving a remarkable effect of depth. The drama combines with the formal elegance of the slender figures and the graceful gestures of people and animals to achieve a magical suspension between fable and reality. Although the conception of the four pictures is due to Botticelli, the execution was entrusted in part to his assistants, in particular Bartolomeo di Giovanni for the first three pictures and Jacopo da Sellaio for the fourth.

Social contributions and studies by Benjamin Franklin

Benjamin Franklin made a lot of social contributions through his studies and foundation of few institutions.
Population studies.
In the 1730s and 1740s he began taking notes on population growth, finding that the American population had the fastest growth rates on earth. Emphasizing that population growth depended on food supplies—a line of thought later developed by Thomas Malthus—Franklin emphasized the abundance of food and available farmland in America. He calculated that America's population was doubling every twenty years and would surpass that of England in a century. In 1751, he drafted "Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &c." Four years later, it was anonymously printed in Boston, and it was quickly reproduced in Britain, where it influenced economists Adam Smith and later Thomas Malthus. Franklin's predictions also alarmed British leaders who did not want to be surpassed by the colonies, so they became more willing to impose restrictions on the colonial economy.
Economics and mercantilism.
Benjamin Franklin, in his capacity as a farmer, wrote at least one critique about the negative consequences of price controls, trade restrictions and subsidy of the poor. This is succinctly preserved in his letter to the London Chronicle published November 29, 1766 titled 'On the Price of Corn, and Management of the poor'.
Franklin's "Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc." influenced economist Adam Smith. His essay theorized how British mercantilism was unsustainable, and it was a response to the British Parliament's prohibition of the construction of ironworks in America brought about by the demands of British manufacturers.
Institutions.
Benjamin Franklin formed both the first public lending library in America and the first fire department in Pennsylvania.

After returning to Charleston in 2006, the Yankees assigned him to the West Oahu CaneFires of the Arizona Fall League after the 2006 season.
Garcia experienced a torn ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his right elbow, which required Tommy John surgery in 2007. After missing the entire 2007 season, Garcia pitched to a 4–4 win-loss record and a 4.33 earned run average (ERA) with 74 strikeouts in innings pitched between the GCL Yankees, Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and Trenton Thunder of Class AA Eastern League in 2008. The Yankees added Garcia to their 40 man roster after the 2008 season. Garcia experienced a recurrence of pain in his right elbow, which required his second elbow surgery, to repair a bone spur. His UCL tore again in 2010, which required his second Tommy John surgery in April 2010. The Yankees released him one month later.
The Washington Nationals signed him in July 2011. In 2012, he allowed only five earned runs in 45 appearances, for a combined ERA of 0.86 for the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League and Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League. On September 3, 2012, he was promoted to the major leagues. The following day, he made his major league debut, inducing a pop-up to end an inning.
Nationals manager Davey Johnson said on September 24 that the team may attempt to convert Garcia into a starter for the 2013 season, citing his fully developed repertoire of pitches.
Garcia spent most of the 2013 season on the disabled list with a torn wrist tendon, shoulder and hamstring injuries, with minor league rehab assignments at Class A Potomac, Class AA Harrisburg, and Class AAA Syracuse.
Garcia was released by the Nationals on June 25, 2014.
Pitching style.
Garcia throws four pitches: a four-seam and two-seam fastball averaging about 96 mph, a sweeping knuckle curveball in the low 80s, and a changeup averaging about 87 mph. Garcia said he was inspired to learn the spike curveball grip from watching Mike Mussina pitch.

Larry King (musician)

Larry King is an American singer-songwriter, music producer, and band leader based in Chicago, Illinois. In the late 1980s King was the founder and lead singer of the Los Angeles glam rock band Human Factor, and after moving back to Chicago, founded the Larry King Orchestra in 1997. He founded MFO Entertainment Group a year later, and remains as president of the company. In 1999 King and John Blasucci founded Soleil Moon, an adult contemporary band that has since had two studio releases, and involved session musicians such as the London Symphony Orchestra, Kenny Aronoff (John Cougar Mellencamp), and Todd Sucherman of Styx.
Early life and education.
Larry King was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. He was involved in the entertainment industry from a young age, and began working as a child actor in television and radio commercials by age seven. Before the age of 13 he had been featured in 52 commercials, and began singing and writing music at age 12. As a teen he would sing jingles for television and radio by day and at night he'd work with local bands alongside his brother, who was a drummer. He was also active in musical theater, including a stint as Bobby Kennedy in "One Shining Moment" at Chicago's Drury Lane Theater.
After high school King attended first the University of Miami and later the University of Wisconsin–Madison. While attending school he began focusing more on music, and wrote over 100 jingles for local and national advertising campaigns.
Music career.
Upon graduating in the late 1980s King moved to Los Angeles, where he formed the band Human Factor. The group was signed to Caliber Records, an independent record label associated with Warner Brothers Distribution. King wrote music, played keys and performed vocals for the band, which he has described as having a glam rock style with epic pop ballads.
In the early 1990s the Human Factor disbanded and King moved back to Chicago and secured a role as a staff writer and musician for River North Records. He became a session singer and wrote the rock opera "Sins Of The Father", staged by the Winston-Salem Repertory Company in North Carolina.
Larry King Orchestra.
In 1997 King conceptualized and formed The Larry King Orchestra, a society band in Chicago. The original incarnation featured King on vocals and eleven musicians. The band has developed a reputation as a high-end wedding band, and has been featured in "CS Brides" three times. On New Years 2010 the band performed at the wedding of NASCAR driver Kyle Busch and Samantha Sarcinella in Chicago.
MFO Entertainment Group.
In 1998 King founded and is president of MFO Entertainment Group, which provides and produces music for studio recordings and live Chicago events like weddings, corporate parties and celebratory functions. Larry King Orchestra is managed through MFO Entertainment. He is also president of Mufaro Publishing, Inc. The group performs both original music and cover songs.
Along with sound engineer Steve Weeder he also co-founded The Sound Bank, a recording studio in Northfield, Illinois.
Soleil Moon.
In 1994 King met and befriended jazz musician John Blasucci. They quickly began making music together, eventually forming the band Soleil Moon. On March 2, 1999 they released their first single "World's Apart" on React Entertainment, with King providing vocals. They supported the release with a ten-city promotional tour, and "World's Apart" became a Top 25 Adult Contemporary hit.
After the single's success King and Blasucci began writing a full-length album. Among the studio musicians enlisted to participate in the project were the London Symphony Orchestra, session guitarist Michael Thompson, jazz musician Paul Jackson, Jr., saxophonist Warren Hill, percussionist Lenny Castro, drummer Kenny Aronoff of John Cougar Mellencamp, and Todd Sucherman of Styx. Many others were also participants in the Larry King Orchestra. "Worlds Apart" was released on March 7, 2000 under King's label MFO Records. Various tracks from the album including "Willingly" and "Never Say Goodbye" charted on the Adult Contemporary Top 100, peaking at #17 and #22 respectively.
On February 1, 2011, Soleil Moon released the studio album "On The Way To Everything" through MFO Entertainment Group. The songs had been recorded periodically since 2001, whenever King and other members found studio time between other projects. A review stated the album blended "bittersweet, melodic ballads, burning hard-rock riffs, percolating R&B grooves, and anything else that happens to suit their fancy, Soleil Moon has made an album about life’s journey, and the conceptual arc is so striking that there’s already been an offer to turn it into a musical."

Worlds Apart (Soleil Moon album)

Worlds Apart is the debut album by Soleil Moon. It was co-written by Larry King and John Blasucci, and released on MFO Records in 2000.
Production.
The 12 tracks were produced, co-written, and arranged by the duo of Larry King and John Blasucci. Among the studio musicians enlisted to participate in the recording sessions were the London Symphony Orchestra, session guitarist Michael Thompson, jazz musician Paul Jackson, Jr., Warren Hill on saxophone, percussionist Lenny Castro, drummer Kenny Aronoff of Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Smashing Pumpkins, and Todd Sucherman of Styx. Many others were also participants in the Larry King Orchestra. "Worlds Apart" was released under King's label MFO Records.
Reception.
In 2000, various tracks from the album including "Willingly" and "Never Say Goodbye" charted on the Adult Contemporary Top 100.
Reviews for the album positive, "Glory Daze Music" saying "As far as genre's go, Soleil Moon could fit into numerous. Smooth jazz would be one. West Coast another. 80's pop is a good fit too. The production on "Worlds Apart" is utterly first class, there is a depth to it that disappears out of sight, the soul and emotion displayed on all the songs is a connection very few musicians (let alone a duo) can expect to achieve in a lifetime." Another review also espoused the production quality, saying "Normally, with more or less independent releases on small labels (or no label at all) it´s the production that fails the most. Not here!"
About the style, "Musical Discoveries" stated "the band's first album blends singer Larry King's epic rock instincts with Blasucci's sleek-flavored approach. A truly unique jazz/pop style has been used by the group in a form never achieved by any other artist."

Benjamin Bwalya

Benjamin Bwalya Jnr (25 August 1961 – 9 February 1999) was a Zambian footballer and coach. Bwalya was the son of soccer administrator Benjamin Bwalya Snr and the elder brother of celebrated former Zambian player Kalusha Bwalya. He played his club football for Mufulira Blackpool, Mufulira Wanderers and Nchanga Rangers, and after retirement he became Konkola Blades’ coach.
Early life.
Bwalya was born in Mufulira to Benjamin Bwalya Sr and Elidah Bwalya and when the family moved to Ndola he went to Kansenshi Primary School from 1968 to 1974. He did his secondary school education at Mufulira Secondary from 1975 and upon completion, went for the compulsory national service training camp in 1981. In 1978, his father travelled to Madagascar with Wanderers and bought Bwalya his first pair of Adidas boots, a pair which he treasured and swore to keep and hang in his house for his children to see.
Playing career.
Bwalya joined Mufulira Blackpool in 1978 where it was quite a challenge playing alongside names like John Lengwe, Simon Kaushi and the player he admired the most, Alex Chola. His young brother Kalusha would follow to watch him play and he eventually joined Blackpool as well. Bwalya could play all forward positions but featured mainly as a right winger, in contrast to his left-footed younger brother who was solely a left winger. In 1981 they moved to the mine-sponsored giants Wanderers at the behest of their father, who felt they were better off playing for the club that was sponsored by the company he worked for.
That same year, he travelled to Lubumbashi with Wanderers and they took part in two friendlies against St. Louis Lupopo and TP Mazembe. It was during this tour that he earned the nickname ‘Boga’ after which he admitted that he did not bother to find out what it meant but the name spread like wildfire in Mufulira.
The hugely talented Bwalya left Wanderers in 1984 for Chingola-based Premier League rivals Nchanga Rangers who he would play for until 1991 after which he retired from playing and coached briefly as one of the assistants at Rangers before joining Konkola Blades in 1992 as coach.
National Team.
Bwalya made a single appearance for Zambia in a friendly against Malawi in 1985 in Ndola which ended in a 1-1 draw.
Although he was often called to the national team, he never featured for Zambia again. In January 1987, he was dropped from the national team, prompting him to question the national team selectors. “You must have full-backs to stay in the national team ... some of the players in the so-called national team are not talented at all.” 
Coaching career.
Upon retirement, Bwalya took up coaching and briefly worked as one of the assistants at Nchanga Stadium before moving to neighbouring Konkola Blades as head coach. Under him, Blades developed into a strong team and won the 1998 Mosi Cup after beating Zanaco FC 2-1 in Lusaka. He also served as coach for the U-17 and U-20 national teams and worked as one of the assistant coaches to Roald Poulsen at the senior national team. He was also appointed assistant coach to Ben Bamfuchile in 1998.
Death.
In January 1999, Bwalya travelled with the national team to Madagascar for a CAN qualifier. On the day of the match, he fell ill and missed the game which Zambia won 2-1. When the team returned, he was admitted to Malcolm Watson Hospital with suspected cerebral malaria on January 27. Bwalya died in hospital on the night of 9 February 1999. The passing of the young coach who was just coming into his own was described as a terrible loss to the football fraternity.

Although the Kuruc-French army was equal in size to the combined Austrian, Danish and Serbian forces, Francis II Rákóczi went on the defense due to the inferior training of his troops. The Danes and Austrians launched a powerful attack on the French and Kuruc infantry. Although the Kuruc infantry held its ground, the Kuruc cavalry could not launch an attack due to a lack of leadership and an overly muddy battlefield. The Austrian cavalry was thus capable of flanking the Hungarians on the left, forcing the Hungarians to retreat and crushing their cavalry in the process. After the battle, the combined Austrian-Danish army bought Transylvania.
Preparations.
The Kuruc forces in campaigns of 1704 liberated much of Hungary from Austrian rule, in so doing establishing numerical parity with the Austrians. However, due to better training, a stronger officer corps and deeper logistical capabilities, the Austrians still won the decisive Battle of Nagyszombat, going on to take back the important fortresses of (Buda, Pressburg and Esztergom). The Austrians subsequently called on aid from Croatian, Serbian and Danish armies.
As a means of counterbalancing Austrian power, Louis XIV of France attempted to support the Kuruc rebels, sending troops and material support. However, following the French defeat at the battle of Höchstädt, Louis was forced to reduce his material contributions to Rákóczi and the Kurucs.
In July 8, 1704 the Transylvanian noble Rákóczi was elected Transylvanian prince and inducted in April 4, 1705. Designed to declared the confederation of Hungary and Transylvania, however problems have occurred in the National Assembly of Szécsény about the army and the legal status of the serfdom. Meanwhile routed the new Habsburg army under Vienna.
In June 27 arrived the Danish military detachment in Vienna (4500 infantry and 1600 cavalry) under Andreas Harboe. The Danish soldiers fought against the French army in the battle of Höchstädt. The Danish-Austrian vanguard under col. Dietrich Glöckelsperg intrude in the Great Rye Island. Baron Herbeville his army mobilized in the island and in July 29 tried to march in Komárno, but because the Kuruc attacks was withdraw in August 3. Meanwhile Miklós Bercsényi and Antal Esterházy invaded Moravia. In August 25 Herbeville he crossed the Transdanubia. In September teak a rest in Buda. The army of János Bottyán (6000 men) tried to disturb the Austrian army.
The Kuruc commanders will have committed serious errors: only in October responded to the attack of Herbeville. Rákóczi reinforced fortifications built near Zsibó, but near Nagyvárad (today: "Oradea, Romania") wanted to fight a battle. Later was decided that the battle will be near Zsibó. Herbeville in October 31 chased the Kuruc army from Nagyvárad, which was besieged for two years. This has a serious defeat for the Kuruc army.
Opposing forces.
Rákóczi's army was well equipped with food and the soldiers were relaxed. However many Kuruc soldiers were weakly trained. The French auxiliary troops of Des Alleurs marqius, Rákóczi's court regiments (Hungarian, Rusyn and German soldiers) and the German mercenaries of Simon Forgách was trained and disciplined soldiers. In the infantry and cavalry served many Romanian soldiers, in addition there was a miscellaneous Hungarian-Romanian-Serbian mounted regiment. The total number of the Kuruch-French army is 15,000 men and 34 cannons. Kuruc army was located in the trenches near Zsibó, but the trenches are not completely prepared.
Herbeville's army was starving, as Bottyán used against the Austrians the scorched-earth tactics and in the Great Rye Island the crops have been harvested, therefore the Austrians did not find too much food. Nevertheless the fighting morale of the army remained. All military units was trained, equipped and disciplined, except for the irregular Serbian cavalry. Under Andreas Harboe and general Frederik Gersdorff fought the Danes (grenadiers, infantrys and cavalrys). The vojvoda of Tököl commanded the Serbian light cavalry. The number of the Austrian-Danish-Serbian army was 16,500 men.

Our Own Oslo

Our Own Oslo () is a 2011 Icelandic comedy film directed by Reynir Lyngdal.
Plot.
While on company business in Oslo, conservative fortyish engineer Harald literally bumps into Icelandic bank worker Vilborg and her drunk boss (also on business in the city) in the lobby of their hotel after his sales presentation in the hotel's conference room. Harald saves the ladies from getting kicked out of the hotel by intervening with the annoyed Norwegian hotel reception manager. After putting Vilborg's passed-out boss to bed, a task he is familiar with from having tended to his now-deceased alcoholic father, Harald experiences a magical night of sightseeing, dining, and romance with Vilborg.
Back at home in Reykjavik and wanting to build on their first night, Harald invites Vilborg out to breakfast. In the course of their early morning date, she is accused of embezzling bank funds by her now sober boss, has her car repossessed off the street in front of her, reveals to Harald she has a gambling addiction, and has an emotional breakdown during which she proposes to drown herself. Enter Harald to the rescue; after he has her over to his apartment to calm her down with hot chocolate, Harald invites Vilborg out to his summer cabin, after which the personal baggage of each grows. Harald has a needy developmentally disabled adult sister, Vilborg has an adolescent son whom she initially forgets to collect, and Harald is busy as the summer cabin association chair and sewer-line maintenance man. To further frustrate the opportunity for romance between the new couple, Vilborg's ex-husband Palmi appears at the summer cabin, and Harald's mom is being pursued by her long-time boyfriend. Following heavy drinking of Harald's liquor by Vilborg and her ex that leads to Vilborg's and Palmi's private reunion in a tent, the exact nature and extent of which is unclear, the Vilborg/Harald romance appears dead.
After Vilborg takes her son, who has finally started to like Harald, and departs in a taxi, Vilborg and Harald each have flashbacks to their carefree special night in the Norwegian capital. Frustrated by the failure of the romance and by pent-up anger toward his deceased alcoholic father, Harald lights the summer cabin on fire to the neighbours' shock and amusement. As the cabin blazes, Vilborg arrives back at the scene desperate to find Harald whom she now realizes she loves and wants to pursue a relationship with.

"Our Own Oslo" was the highest grossing film for 2011 in Iceland theatres.

<doc id="36843243" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36843243" title="Preference test">
Preference test

A preference test is an experiment in which animals are allowed free access to multiple environments which differ in one or more variants. Various aspects of the animal's behaviour can be measured such as latency to approach the variants, relative consumption of variants, the number of entries and duration of time spent in different environments, or the range of activities in each of the environments. These measures can be recorded either by the experimenter or by motion detecting software. Statistical testing is used to determine whether the differences are large enough in comparison to the control group or the individual animal, to conclude that preference or aversion has occurred. Strength of preference can be inferred by the magnitude of the difference in the response, but see "Advantages and disadvantages" below. Prior to testing, the animals are usually given the opportunity to explore the apparatus and variants to habituate and reduce the effects of novelty.
Preference tests can be used to test for preferences of only one characteristic of the variant, e.g. cage colour, or multiple characteristics of complex variants e.g. a choice between hamster wheel, Habitrail tunnels or additional empty space for extended locomotion.
Types of test.
The simplest of preference tests offers a choice between two variants. This can be achieved using different variants at the ends of the arms of a 'T' shaped maze, or having a chamber divided in half with one variant available in one half and the other variant available in the other half. A famous example of this simple method is an investigation of the preferences of chickens for different types of wire floor in battery cages. Two types of metal mesh flooring were being used in the 1950s; one type was a large, open mesh using thick wire, the other was a smaller mesh size but the wire was considerably thinner. A prestigious committee, the Brambell Committee, conducting an investigation into farm animal animal welfare concluded the thicker mesh should be used as this was likely to be more comfortable for the chickens. However, preference tests showed that chickens preferred the thinner wire. Photographs taken from under the cages showed that the thinner mesh offered more points of contact for the feet than the thick mesh, thereby spreading the load on the hens' feet and presumably feeling more comfortable to the birds.
The number of variants that can be offered is theoretically limitless for some preference tests, e.g. light intensity, cage size, food types, however, the number is often limited by experimental practicalities, current practice (e.g. animal caging systems) or costs. Furthermore, animals usually investigate all areas of the apparatus, even those areas of minor preference, meaning that differences in behaviour become less distinct as the number of variants increases.
A major disadvantage of preference tests is that there is no 'cost' on the animal making a choice. Therefore, these studies do not give an indication of how essential or necessary any of the variants are to the animal. For example, if a laboratory mouse normally housed in a small cage was offered three sizes of additional space, it would almost certainly show a preference for one of the size variants, but this does not address the question of whether the mouse 'needs' that space additional to its home cage or whether it is simply wandering around the apparatus because the space is available. To investigate 'need' more elaborate tests called consumer demand studies can be performed which place a 'cost', e.g. lever pressing, weighted door, on the animal gaining access to the variants.
Uses.
Preference tests have been used widely in the study of animal behaviour and motivation, e.g.-

Högby Lighthouse is a Swedish lightstation. The lighthouse is built of iron and painted white. The design by architect Johan Höjer is unique to Sweden. The tower was exhibited at the Stockholm Exposition in 1897 before being located in Högby on a narrow peninsula. The flame ran on kerosene at first, and was updated with a gas mantle light in 1908. It was electrified in 1945 with a 1000 watt bulb and fully automated in 1967. Today the light runs with a faint 60 watt bulb, and the old rotating Fresnel lens has been replaced. The lighthouse is owned by The Swedish Maritime Administration.
Both the keeper's house and lighthouse is protected as a culturally important building since 1978. Today the keeper's house is a private residence to an artist and contains an art studio and showroom.

Voima (1952 icebreaker)

Voima is a Finnish state-owned icebreaker. Built by Wärtsilä Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki in 1954, she was the first icebreaker in the world to be equipped with two bow propellers and generated widespread publicity that helped the Finnish shipbuilding industry to become the world leader in icebreaker design.
"Voima" was extensively refitted in 1978–1979. , she is the oldest and smallest icebreaker in service in Finland and is scheduled to be replaced by a new icebreaker by the winter of 2015–16. However, she might remain in limited service after this.
Development and construction.
In the Moscow Armistice, signed on 19 September 1944, Finland agreed to pay war reparations of US$300 million to the Soviet Union. The war reparations, paid in the form of ships and machinery over six years, included the newest steam-powered state-owned icebreakers "Voima" and "Jääkarhu". This left Finland with one modern diesel-electric icebreaker, "Sisu", which had been damaged by a naval mine during the war, and four older steam-powered icebreakers. Of these, especially "Murtaja" and "Apu" were considered nearly obsolete and their efforts in the Archipelago Sea were sometimes described being "mostly of moral nature". As a result, only the ports of Hanko and Turku were kept open through the first post-war winters.
In 1946, the Finnish Government appointed a committee to start planning the rebuilding of the Finnish icebreaker fleet. The committee, consisting of the director of the Finnish Maritime Administration, Svante Sundman, and two experienced Finnish shipbuilders, K. Albin Johansson and Ossian Tybeck, delivered its final report on the construction of a new icebreaker in the following year. The main dimensions of the new 4,415-ton icebreaker, large enough to escort 10,000-ton dry cargo ships or 16,000-ton tankers, were based on the old "Jääkarhu", but the triple-expansion steam engines were replaced with a modern diesel-electric propulsion system, similar to the 1939-built "Sisu", with a combined output of 10,500 shp. In the early drafts, the new icebreaker was designed with three propellers (two in the stern and one in the bow) and an asymmetric stem that would compensate for the transverse force caused by the bow propeller. However, these features were later dropped after extensive model testing and co-operation with Swedish naval architects in favor of a completely new design.
The result was, in many respects, the most advanced icebreaker in the world at the time. Although bow propellers had been a common feature in icebreakers around the world for decades, it was incorrectly believed that they helped with the actual icebreaking process by reducing the pressure under the ice in front of the ship. However, extensive research and recent experiences had shown that bow propellers improved the icebreaking capability because their flushing effect reduced the friction between the broken ice floes and the hull of the ship. The drawback of a single bow propeller was that it would lubricate only one side of the hull. As a result, the new Finnish icebreaker was designed with two bow propellers which would produce a more powerful and, more importantly, symmetric flushing effect. Furthermore, a vessel with four propellers would be extremely maneuverable and capable of even moving sideways. Prior to the new Finnish icebreaker, only the 1947-built Canadian ferry "Abegweit" had been fitted with such propulsion arrangement. While the new ship was not the most powerful icebreaker in the world at the time, the power-to-displacement and power-to-beam ratios of the new Finnish icebreaker put her in a class of her own among icebreaking ships.
The construction of the first Finnish post-war icebreaker was awarded to Wärtsilä in 1948, but due to lack of funding the keel of the ship was not laid down at the Hietalahti shipyard until 29 May 1951. The working name of the newbuilding was "Into", but when she was launched on 27 November 1952, the new Finnish icebreaker was christened "Voima" by Sylvi Kekkonen, wife of the Prime Minister and future President of Finland, Urho Kekkonen. Her name, Finnish for "power", had previously been given to one of the icebreakers that had been handed over to the Soviet Union after the war. The official sea trials were completed on 12 February 1954 and on the following day "Voima" was handed over to the Finnish Maritime Administration.
The new state-owned icebreaker generated widespread publicity and the follow-up orders allowed Wärtsilä to establish the Finnish shipbuilding industry as the world leader in the design and construction of icebreaking ships. After "Voima", the shipyard delivered three icebreakers of similar design to the Soviet Union ("Kapitan Belousov", "Kapitan Voronin" and "Kapitan Melehov") and one for the Swedish Maritime Administration ("Oden"). By the late 1980s, Wärtsilä had produced about 60 percent of the worldwide icebreaker fleet, including all Finnish icebreakers in service at the time.
Career.
Early career.
While the new icebreaker was being built, the state-owned icebreaker fleet had become a powerful strike weapon for Niilo Wälläri, the chairman of the Finnish Seamen's Union. By the early 1950s, the strikes had become so common that they were sometimes considered a normal part of the arrival of winter. It was also jokingly said that a new icebreaker strike could be predicted simply by looking at the thermometer—the "strike limit" would be reached when the temperature dropped low enough for the seas to freeze. When Wälläri announced a new strike in 1953, the Finnish Government decided to take action as the icebreaker strikes effectively stopped all foreign trade during the winter months, causing major losses for the Finnish industry. In Sweden, the state-owned icebreakers were part of the Swedish Navy and thus were not allowed to go on strike. On 9 February 1954, only four days before "Voima" was commissioned, it was decided to move the new icebreaker under the Finnish Navy, where it would replace the 77-year-old "Von Döbeln" as the supply ship for the torpedo boats during the summer months. During the icebreaking season, the ship would still be crewed by the Navy, but used to escort merchant ships under the command of the Finnish Maritime Administration.
The change of flag was postponed until the end of the winter season due to opposition from the Seamen's Union. When "Voima" was transferred to the Finnish Navy on 1 May 1954, the Seamen's Union announced that Finnish merchant ships, crewed by civilians, would not subject themselves to military authority by accepting assistance from a naval ship. As a result, the ports of Kotka and Hamina were effectively closed during the first months of the following winter, trapping a number of ships in the harbors, as "Voima" was the only icebreaker stationed in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland. Eventually, the Government gave up and called "Voima" to Helsinki, where she remained until the spring. On 1 December 1955, "Voima" was transferred back to the Finnish Maritime Administration.
Although the commissioning of the new icebreaker did not go as planned, "Voima" still brought a long-awaited relief to the Finnish winter navigation. During the extremely difficult winter of 1956, she broke all previous records by escorting or otherwise assisting 616 icebound ships, among them the steam-powered icebreakers "Sampo" and "Tarmo" that had been immobilized by compressive pack ice. "Voima" also proved the superiority of two bow propellers in Baltic ice conditions and experiences from her first years in service were used to design the new "Karhu"-class icebreakers in the late 1950s. "Voima" remained the most powerful icebreaker in the Finnish state-owned fleet until the new 12,000 hp "Tarmo"-class icebreakers entered service in the mid-1960s.
Refitting.
The rebuilding and expanding of the Finnish icebreaker fleet continued until all Finnish ports could be kept open year-round. In the late 1970s, the first post-war icebreakers were approaching either mid-life update or retirement. As a result, the 25-year-old "Voima" was extensively rebuilt by Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard in 1978–1979 at a cost of about FIM 86 million, 60% of the price of a new icebreaker of comparable size. In the refit, "Voima" received new hull plating and additional ice-strengthening, new main engines and a completely new superstructure to accommodate the crew, and her propulsion motors and electrical systems were completely refurbished. After the refit, "Voima" was practically a new ship with only web frames, bottom plating, forepeak and propellers remaining from the original ship and, at 14,000 shaft horsepower, the third most powerful icebreaker of Finland at the time. She returned to service on 10 October 1979.
During the refit, the hull of "Voima" was painted bright red in order to improve the ship's visibility in fog. However, the experiment was not continued after the first five-year period, and in the mid-1980s she was painted back to the traditional colors.
Later career.
After the refit, "Voima" resumed her duties as an escort icebreaker. As more powerful icebreakers entered service in the 1980s and 1990s, she has operated mainly in the Gulf of Finland. During the particularly mild winters of 1995 and 2002, she remained at stand-by at Katajanokka through the winter. Although "Voima" had been involved in minor collisions and other incidents in the past, she had not been grounded until 11 April 2003, when she ran aground while assisting a small German cargo ship in difficult conditions outside Helsinki. However, there were only minor dents in the hull plating and some damage to the bow propeller blades, which were repaired at Vuosaari shipyard on 14–17 April.
Following the reorganization of the Finnish Maritime Administration in 2004, the ownership and management of the state-owned vessels was transferred to a newly founded state-owned enterprise, Finstaship. Since 2010, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers have been owned and operated by the state-owned shipping company Arctia Shipping through its subsidiary, Arctia Icebreaking. However, the management of "Voima" has been separated to a separate subsidiary company, "Jäänmurtaja Voima Oy".
Future.
, "Voima" is the oldest and smallest state-owned icebreaker in service in Finland. She is also technically the oldest icebreaker in the world still in active service, although after her extensive refit in the late 1970s not much remains of the ship launched in 1953.
In 2008, the Finnish Maritime Administration announced that it would start planning a replacement for "Voima". However, the new icebreaker that was expected to cost 100-120 million euro was not included in the budget proposals until 2012. While Arctia Shipping, the state-owned shipping company that operates the Finnish icebreaker fleet, stated that the company would prefer to replace the retiring traditional icebreakers with new multipurpose ships that could be chartered to support offshore drilling during the summer months, the Finnish Minister of Transport Merja Kyllönen voiced her opposition to a ship that would be 50% more expensive to build than a traditional icebreaker. There is also a growing public opposition to Arctic drilling which could result in an ecological disaster in case of a major oil spill. Some Finnish politicians have even proposed that instead of purchasing a new icebreaker to replace "Voima", Finland should try to manage with a smaller icebreaker fleet and accept that some ports would likely be closed during the coldest winters.
In April 2013, the Finnish Transport Agency awarded the design contract for the new icebreaker to the Finnish engineering companies Aker Arctic and ILS. On 22 January 2014, the construction of the 125 million euro vessel was awarded to Arctech Helsinki Shipyard. The new state-owned icebreaker will be able to move continuously in level ice with a thickness of and reach an average speed of during escort operations in the Baltic Sea. The vessel will be powered by environmentally friendly dual fuel engines capable of using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel. In addition to icebreaker duties, the new vessel will be fitted for emergency towing and oil spill response.
Initially, the new icebreaker was expected to replace "Voima" starting from the winter of 2015–16. However, when the vessel was ordered on 22 January 2014, it was stated that it would instead primarily replace the "Atle"-class icebreaker "Frej" that the Finnish government has charted from Sweden. Thus, "Voima" is expected to remain in at least limited service after the new icebreaker has been delivered.
Technical details.
General characteristics.
With an overall length of and a moulded beam of , "Voima" was once the longest and widest icebreaker ever built in Finland. At a draft of , her waterline measures in length and she can break a channel with a width of . Although her refit increased the draft of the ship to and displacement from 4,415 tons to 5,209 tons, she is now the smallest and lightest of the Finnish state-owned icebreakers. "Voima" was built to the highest ice class at the time, Lloyd's Register 1A, with a fully welded hull and shell plating measuring in thickness in the ice belt. Her ice strengthening was further increased in the refit. While "Voima" holds the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, it has hardly any meaning for icebreakers which are of considerably stronger build than merchant ships operating in their care.
Despite being the most advanced icebreaker in the world, "Voima" still looked aesthetically pleasing with her low, gently rounded hull and superstructure. Many of her features, such as the open bridge with covered bridge wings, could be traced back to the pre-war steam-powered icebreakers. She had two continuous decks and a long forecastle that contained most of the cabins and social areas for the crew of 58. Although "Voima" was built with two small cargo holds for storage purposes, most of the space under the main deck is occupied by the engine and propulsion motor rooms, making the icebreaker literally "a ship loaded with power". She also has eight heeling tanks that can be used to free the icebreaker from compressive pack ice. Like the steam-powered icebreakers built before the war, she was also fitted with deck gun mounts. During the refit, the old superstructure was completely removed and replaced with an angular deckhouse slightly resembling those of "Sisu" and "Urho". The crew, now accommodated in individual cabins high in the superstructure away from the noises generated by the icebreaking process, was reduced to 44 due to advancing automation. Later the crew has been further reduced to 21.
Power and propulsion.
When "Voima" was built, she was powered by six 8-cylinder Atlas Polar K58M two-stroke diesel engines driving 1,370kVA Strömberg direct current generators. The main engines were located in two separate engine rooms, three engines side-by-side, together with four 6-cylinder Atlas Polar K56E auxiliary engines producing each. In the refit, the old engines were replaced with six modern 16-cylinder Wärtsilä 16V22 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines, each producing while coupled to Strömberg alternators rated at 2,700 kVA.
Prior to the refit, the propulsion power was fed to four direct current electric motors located in separate engine rooms, two in the stern and two in the bow, through an applied Ward Leonard drive system. The propulsion motors, rated at each, were also produced by Strömberg and were the largest electric motors ever manufactured in Finland at the time. The main engines limited the combined shaft power of "Voima" to , of which two thirds of the available propulsion power was diverted to the bow propellers in severe ice conditions. In weak ice and mild ice conditions, the power ratio between the bow and stern propellers could be reversed as the latter have higher propulsion efficiency. The original propulsion motors were thoroughly refurbished in the refit and the diesel-electric powertrain was changed from DC/DC to AC/DC like in the newer Finnish icebreakers. Furthermore, the increased output of the main engines allowed full utilization of the available propulsion power, increasing the available shaft power to , thus making "Voima" the third most powerful state-owned icebreaker in Finland at the time. Her open water speed, around , has remained the same after the refit, but with the new main engines she can break level ice with thickness of at . After the refit, the bollard pull of "Voima" was measured to be 113 tons.
The propeller shafts that connect the propulsion motors to the four-bladed steel propellers and the rudder stock all have a diameter of . The bow propellers weigh while the bigger stern propellers have a diameter of and weigh each. Both the propellers and the propeller shafts were retained in the refit. The original steering arrangement, a single center rudder mounted at the sternpost, was also retained although newer icebreakers have twin rudders for improved manoeuvrability.

Ishvara Gita

The Ishvara Gita (Devanagari: ईश्वर गीता, IAST: ) is a Sanskrit text composed in India. It contains the teachings of the god Shiva, also called Ishvara, and is influenced by the Bhagavad Gita as well as the Samkhya and Yoga schools of Indian philosophy. It makes up the first 11 chapters of the second section (uttara vibhaga) of the Kurma Purana.
Although some verses of the Ishvara Gita are directly repeated from the Bhagavad Gita, it also contains many new themes, such as the worship of the linga and the idea that Shiva, not Krishna, is the ultimate god. The Ishvara Gita also shows the influence of the 8-fold (ashtanga) yoga of Patanjali, and of the Pashupata sect of Shaivism. Several commentaries on this text are available in manuscript form, perhaps most notably by Vijnanabhiksu, a 16th-century Hindu polymath.
The Ishvara Gita has been translated into English, French and Italian in stand-alone form, and into English as part of a complete translation of the Kurma Purana.

United Nations Emergency Force Medal

The United Nations Emergency Force Medal was a service medal of the United Nations for service in the United Nations Emergency Force between 7 November 1956 and 19 May 1967.
History.
In 1956, Egypt came into conflict with the combined forces of Israel, France, and the United Kingdom resulting in the Suez Crisis. Combined political pressure from the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations resulted in the withdrawal of French, British and Israeli forces from Egyptian territory and the cessation of hostilities. To maintain the peace the United Nations established its first Peacekeeping force, the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF). Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, India, Norway, Sweden and Yugoslavia provided troops to serve in the UNEF. The mission lasted from November 1956 until June 1967. Ninety days of service with the UNEF was required for award of the medal.
Appearance.
The medal, similar in appearance to other United Nations Medals, is a circular bronze medal in diameter. The obverse depicts the official emblem of the United Nations, a world map oriented from the north pole. Above the emblem are the letters UNEF. The reverse is plain except for the words "In the Service of Peace" in relief.
The medal is suspended from a sand yellow ribbon with an 8 mm central stripe of light blue. On either side of the central stripe, 3 mm from the edge, is a 1 mm stripe of dark blue 2 mm apart from a 1 mm stripe of dark green. The sand yellow color of the ribbon represents the Sinai while the wide central stripe represented the UN. Of the two thin stripes, the blue represents the Suez Canal, and the green represents the Nile River Valley.

Indian Army United Nations peacekeeping missions

India has been the largest troop contributor to UN missions since its inception. So far India has taken part in 43 Peacekeeping missions with a total contribution exceeding troops and a significant number of police personnel having been deployed. In 2014 India is the third largest troop contributor with 7,860 personnel deployed with ten UN Peacekeeping Missions of which 995 are police personnel, including the first Female Formed Police Unit under the UN.
Recently Indian Peacekeepers were lauded by the UN for their efforts in preventing a carnage in the South Sudan conflict which resulted in the death of two of its soldiers.
India has so far, provided one Military Advisor (Lt Gen R K Mehta), one Police Adviser (Ms Kiran Bedi), one Deputy Military Adviser (Lt Gen Abhijit Guha), 14 Force Commanders and numerous Police Commissioners in various UN Missions. Indian Army has also contributed lady officers as Military Observers and Staff Officers apart from them forming part of Medical Units being deployed in UN Missions. The first all women contingent in peacekeeping mission, a Formed Police Unit from India, was deployed in 2007 to the UN Operation in Liberia (UNMIL). Lt Gen Satish Nambiar, a former Indian Army Lieutenant General served as the United Nations Protection Force commander from March 1992 to March 1993. He also served on the "High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change" of the Peacebuilding Commission.
India was reappointed to the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission in December 2010, for a third 2-year term. India is supportive of nationally-led plans for peace consolidation, while arguing for a constructive approach and a "lighter touch" by the Peacebuilding Commission in extending advice, support and in extending its involvement. India has also been contributing to the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund.
Past Missions.
The following are the Indian contributions to the United Nations Peacekeeping Missions since 1950.
(a) Korea (1950–54): Paramedical Unit composed of 17 officers, 9 JCOs and 300 other ranks was deployed to facilitate withdrawal of sick and wounded in Korea. Lt-Gen. K S Thimmayya was appointed as the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission set up by UN. India also provided a custodian force under Major General S.P.P.

The mission has a Deputy Force Commander Brig Asit Mistry (Indian Army) and until recently a Deputy Police Commissioner Mr Sanjay Kundu (Indian Police Service) was also present there. The latest political developments in the Mission led to widespread inter-tribe violence and large displacement of locals. In the ensuing intra state conflict two Indian Peacekeepers lost their lives while ensuring Protection of Civilians. The current situation continues to be highly volatile and sporadic clashes between the tribes are being reported regularly.
(d) Golan Heights (UNDOF) (Since February 2006): A Logistics battalion with 190 personnel has been deployed to look after the logistics security of UNDOF. Maj.Gen. I.S. Singha is the Force Commander since July 2012.

(e) Ivory Coast (UNOCI) (Since April 2004): The mission has been supported by Indian staff officers (SOs) and military observers since its inception.
(f) Haiti (MINUSTAH) (Since December 1997): Apart from three Indian Formed Police Unit (FPU) there, i.e. from CISF, CRPF and Assam Rifles, which have been successful, the mission has been supported by Indian Army staff officers since its inception.
(g) Liberia (UNMIL) (Since April 2007): India has been contributing both male and female Formed Police Units from CRPF and its Specialized unit RAF in Liberia. The Female Formed Police Unit (FPU) has especially become an inspiration for the women of the host nation and have become trendsetters for other such female FPUs across the Globe. Till recently, Mr Gautam Sawang of India was the acting Police Commissioner there.
Allegations of Sexual Misconduct.
Allegations of sexual misconduct by the Indian Peacekeepers in Democratic Republic of the Congo in the year 2008 were forwarded by the United Nations to the Indian Army headquarters in Delhi. The allegations gained ground after children with distinct Indian features were delivered by the women. India takes pride in the fact that it is one of the biggest contributors to the UN peacekeeping missions, but its participation in the Congo mission has remained controversial with reports of misconduct surfacing from time to time.
The army's internal mechanism is such that any breach of discipline does not go unpunished. In this case, too, a court of inquiry was promptly ordered which looked into the conduct of 12 officers and 39 jawans. The court collected the DNA samples of all the officers and jawans to ascertain the veracity of the complaints. It is learnt that a DNA sample matched with one of the children born to a Congolese woman. A court of inquiry concluded in Meerut recently has found enough ground for disciplinary action against a jawan. Three other army men, including a Major, have been charged with control and command failure and administrative action has been recommended against them. Though the complete report of the probe is yet to be declared, its conclusion, shared by the army authorities, points to the fact that other accused officers and jawans have been given a clean chit. The Congo sex scandal has also been in news because of the name of Army Chief General Bikram Singh being dragged into the controversy. General Singh was the Deputy Force Commander in Congo when the incidents of sexual misconduct allegedly took place.

Edna McGriff

Edna McGriff (December 16, 1935 – March 1980) was an American rhythm and blues singer and pianist. She recorded mainly in the 1950s, and secured one hit single on the US "Billboard" R&B chart with "Heavenly Father" in 1952. The record sold over 500,000 copies.
Life and career.
Edna McGriff was born in Tampa, Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. She was educated at Washington Irving High School in New York. She released her first single, "Note Droppin' Papa" / "Come Back", on Jubilee Records in September 1951 with Bennie Green's band. Her second recording took place late that same year, when she sang with Buddy Lucas and His Band of Tomorrow on "Heavenly Father" / "I Love You". She was aged 16 at the time. The single was released in early 1952, and sales started to soar. The track entered the US R&B chart in April 1952, peaking at No. 4 in a 13-week stay. Various cover versions of "Heavenly Father" appeared, recorded by Fran Warren, The Four Lads, and also Evelyn Knight.
McGriff appeared on stage at the Earle Theater in Philadelphia. Various shows followed, where she was placed on the bill with Alan Freed. Separately in June 1952, McGriff recorded six duets with Sonny Til of The Orioles, including "I Only Have Eyes for You", "Once in a While", "Picadilly" and "Good".
Her next solo release was "Pray For A Better World" / "In A Chapel by the Side of The Road", followed by "Edna's Blues" / "Why Oh Why" (1953). Several other releases flopped and she moved to Josie Records, who issued "I'll Be Around" / "Ooh, Little Daddy" (1954), and then onto Favorite Records, but without any further chart activity. Bell Records took up her contract, and issued "The Fool" / "Born to Be with You" (1956), and these were followed by many other cover versions, including Laurie London's "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" and Huey "Piano" Smith's "Don't You Just Know It", however she had stopped recording with Bell by the time she was 22 years old. In 1958, she recorded a one-off single for Felsted, followed by another one-off for Savoy, this time duetting with long time friend Buddy Lucas on "No Change" / "Ah-Ah-Ah". Thereafter her career gradually wound down, with a small sprinkle of recordings spread over two different record companies - Willow Records in 1961 (a remake of "Heavenly Father"), and Capitol during 1964-1965.
The Connecticut Marriage Index 1959-2001, reveals that at age 23 she married Leroy Minors in Stamford, Fairfield County, Connecticut, on March 7, 1959. The Social Security Death Index records that Edna Minors (née McGriff) died in Queens, New York in March 1980, aged 44 years.
In August 2012, a compilation album of her recordings was issued by Bear Family Records.

Ruger 96

The Ruger 96 was a series of lever-action rifles produced by Sturm, Ruger & Co.. They featured a short-throw lever action, cross button safety and a visible cocking lever. The 4 different variants of the 96 represented the four calibers the rifle came in: 96/17 for .17 HMR, 96/22 for .22LR, 96/22M for .22 Magnum and 96/44 for .44 Magnum. All four models had a hard wood stock.
Ruger 96/22 "(production discontinued)".
The .22LR 96/22 feeds from the same magazines as the popular Ruger 10/22 series. From the factory, it comes with the standard flush-fitting 10 round rotary magazine. Since it shares the magazine with the 10/22, the capacities available for the 96/22 include 10, 25, 50, etc. It utilizes the same v-block and barrels from the late model v-block style Ruger 77/22. Because of this, with an allen wrench, the owner can replace the barrel with a 77/22 barrel. To use a 10/22 barrel, the process is the same as converting a 10/22 barrel for use in a 77/22. Both the 77/22 and 96/22 have dual, opposed extractors. A slot for the left side extractor must be cut into a 10/22 barrel to use it in a 96/22 or 77/22.
Ruger 96/44 "(production discontinued)".
The .44 Remington Magnum 96/44 feeds from a four round rotary magazine. It does not share magazines with the Ruger 77/44. The action of the 96/44 does not anchor itself directly to the stock with an action screw as almost all rifles do. There is a block on the underside of the barrel that is threaded for the action screw. The stock is attached to the barrel, and the barrel to the action. The rifled barrel has a twist rate of 1 turn in 20", allowing heavy hunting bullets to stabilize. This is relatively rare for 44 magnums, which usually are rifled at a rate of 1 turn in 38 inches. The 1:20" twist is appreciated by those wanting to fire 325gr ammunition for hunting large game.

Nunk (song)

"Nunk" (also known as "Nunk (New Wave Funk)") is the first single by the electro hip-hop group, Warp 9, released on Prism Records in 1982, written and produced by Lotti Golden and Richard Scher. The song appeared on the group's 1983 debut album "It's a Beat Wave" on Prism Records and 4th & Broadway records in the UK.
"Nunk" was used in a commercial by New York City radio station WKTU as it exemplified the sound of emerging hip hop The all-electronic sound, by 1982, had become the trend on the street and in dance clubs due to "extraordinary advances in electronic music technology in the late 70's and early 80's." Drum machines, especially the Roland TR-808 lowered the cost of record production, providing opportunities for experimental records, like "Nunk" to hit the airwaves. Warp 9 was described as "the perfect instance of hip hop's contemporary ramifications." 
"Nunk" was code for NUNK= N-ew wave + f-UNK. The record was characterized by a robotic chant, layered with syncopated rhythms and arcade-sounding, sci-fi influenced synths from funky keyboard riffs to eerie string lines. "Nunk"'s popularity helped Warp 9 develop a large following in the New York metropolitan area, leading to a world wide deal with Island Records (Prism/Island Records in the U.S.) on which their debut LP, It's a Beat Wave and subsequent singles were released. The producers, Lotti Golden and Richard Scher mixed dub and instrumental versions of "Nunk" which created additional club and remix possibilities.

Pearl Vardon

Pearl Joyce Vardon (5 April 1915 Jersey, Channel Islands – unknown) was a British broadcaster of Nazi propaganda during World War II. In 1946 she was convicted of an offence under the Defence Regulations and sentenced to 9 months' imprisonment.
Biography.
Pearl Vardon was a school teacher on Jersey when the island fell under the German Occupation of the Channel Islands in 1940. As she spoke German, she found herself ordered by the German administration to work locally as an interpreter for a construction company based in Cologne.
She began a relationship with a Wehrmacht officer, Oberleutnant Siegfried Schwatlo, and when he was posted to Germany in 1944 she decided to go with him.
Propaganda for Nazi Germany.
Vardon began employment as an announcer at Radio Luxembourg for the DES, the Deutsche Europasender. She introduced music and programmes such as "Ladies First" which criticised the USA and praised Germany's social security system, and "Matters of Moment" which gave news from a German perspective. More significantly, in "For the Forces and their Kin", she read out letters written by British POWs for their families back home. A German colleague later said of Vardon's attitude that she "simply hated all things English and loved all things German".
In mid 1944 she was evacuated to Berlin and in October 1944 she was working at Apen in Lower Saxony until the Red Army drew close on the advancing Eastern Front.
Arrest.
Vardon fled from Apen to Wilhelmshaven, arriving on 30 April 1945. She was arrested there when she enquired how to obtain new identity papers and she was then held by the British Army at Esterwegen Internment Camp, the former Esterwegen concentration camp, where she was interrogated.
Trial.
Vardon was tried at the Old Bailey in February 1946. There she pled guilty to the offence of ‘doing an act likely to assist the enemy’ and was given a nine-month prison sentence.
After Release.
Pearl Vardon eventually married Siegfried Schwatlo in 1950 at Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. Her subsequent life is unknown.
Declassified Files.
The declassified MI5 files on her were released by the Public Record Office in 2000. They show that British prosecutors were inclined to take a more lenient attitude towards female collaborators such as Vardon and Margaret Joyce, the wife of the traitor William Joyce, than with their male counterparts. 
The MI5 report on Vardon states, ‘Her motive seems to have been the clear one of avoiding as much as possible separation from the German officer with whom she fell in love’ but added, ‘It is just possible that her motives were not so simple as they appear to have been on the surface’.

<doc id="36843574" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36843574" title="Vesiculovirus matrix proteins">
Vesiculovirus matrix proteins

The family of vesiculovirus matrix proteins consists of several matrix proteins of the vesicular stomatitis virus, also known as VSIV or VSV. The matrix (M) protein of the virus causes many of the cytopathic effects of VSV, including an inhibition of host gene expression and the induction of cell rounding. It has been shown that M protein also induces apoptosis in the absence of other viral components. It is thought that the activation of apoptotic pathways causes the inhibition of host gene expression and cell rounding by M protein.
Function.
These proteins play a major role in assembly and budding of VSIV virions. Their main role is to aid virus assembly. They starts by shutting off host cell transcription by inhibiting mRNA nuclear export through direct interaction with the host RAE1-NUP98 complex. This inhibits interferon signaling and thus establishment of antiviral state in virus infected cells. In turn, this induces cell-rounding, cytoskeleton disorganization and apoptosis in infected cell. Enveloped viruses acquire their membrane by budding at a membrane of their host cell.
Structure.
The structure of these matrix proteins has revealed a single-globular domain with a new fold. The N-terminal part consists of a large five-stranded anti-paralle beta-sheet packed against two alpha-helices; the C-terminal part comprises a small two stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet and an alpha-helix.

MV Monte Penedo

Cargo vessel Monte Penedo was the first German sea-going diesel-engined motor vessel. Seized by the Brazilian Government in 1917 and renamed Sabara, she operated various routes from Brazil. From 1948 until scrapping in 1969 she was named Ascanio Coelho.
History.
"Monte Penedo" was launched two years after Dutch tanker Vulcanus and one year after Danish , both claimed to be the world's first ocean-going diesel ship.
Following a transatlantic crossing from Hamburg (non-stop from Lisbon to Paranaguá, Brazil), cracks were found in several pistons of "Monte Penedo"s engines. As a precaution, all the pistons were replaced in Buenos Aires. During the subsequent thirty-day voyage from Rosario to Hamburg in February 1914, the engines worked without fault. On inspection, the engines showed no problems and no appreciable wear. Average fuel consumption was 7,200 kg per 24 hours. The International Marine Engineering magazine, Vol 18 (1913), has a report from Sulzer Brothers refuting rumours of an unsatisfactory engine.
From 1914 to 1917, the German-flagged vessel took shelter at Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, to avoid capture by Allied forces. In 1917, she was seized by the Brazilian Government and renamed "Sabara". From 1922, she was managed by Lloyd Brasilieiro, and eventually purchased by them in 1927.
"Sabara" does not appear in any convoy records during World War II. During 1948, she was renamed "Ascanio Coelho". She was broken up in Rio de Janeiro during December 1969.
Layout.
"Monte Penedo" was initially fitted with two Sulzer 4S47 two-stroke crosshead diesel engines. These were replaced in 1949 with new Sulzer 7TS36 diesel engines.

DM3 Density Meter

The DM3 Density Meter (also known as the DM3 or SCIAM DM3 Density Meter), is a newly developed system for density measurement. A part of a continuous, in-line measurement device that is used in major slurry industries and applications to accurately and safely calculate density. Invented by Sciam Worldwide. 
Principle.
The DM3 weighs media (slurry) as it travels through a metered section of pipe using a patented, high resolution load cell. Using linear, direct sensing of mass per unit volume, measurement system within a reinforced rubber tube. This in-line section of pipe calculates % dry solids, wet density and wet or dry mass flow units. When coupled with compatible volumetric flow meters and processing units, this system gives a true value for density and mass flow. The DM3 is a bi-directional unit which allows media to flow continuously through either ends. "C" Clamps located within the DM3 allows the flow tube to withhold high levels of pressure encountered. The flow tube was designed to focus on the highest amount of accuracy, resolution, and least amount of weight without compromising mechanical stability and reliability. Because of the sensitivity of measurement provided by DM3, each unit must be programmed and calibrated to accommodate the variation in Earth’s gravitational force.
Until now, the most critical problem with traditional density measurement systems is the effect of externally induced vibration and media noise superimposed on the weights signal. Designed for this purpose, the DM3 absorbs a significant amount of energy from external media noise and vibration due to low natural frequency (know as Pink noise). It is necessary to compensate for these forces which affect the true density signal. Pink noise is interrogated by the DM3 transmitter over 110 times per second to ensure repeatability to and calculate the positive and negative values for each period to ensure accurate and repeatable measurement of the slurry within a 45 millisecond response time.

Prince Louis of Liechtenstein

Prince Aloys Franz de Paula Maria (1846-1920), known in English as Prince Louis, was the son of Prince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein (1802-1887) and younger brother of Prince Alfred of Liechtenstein. He was the cousin of Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein. He was nicknamed "The Red Prince" ("der rote Prinz").
Life and career.
As did most of his family, Aloys attended the Schottengymnasium in Vienna.
Prince Liechtenstein was an Austrian politician and social reformer. He was an opponent of liberalism, serving in the Reichsrat from 1878-1889 as a Catholic-Conservative member of parliament. In 1881 he became a member, and from 1888-1889 was chairman of the conservative "Zentrum-Klub". In 1875 he met Karl von Vogelsang and in 1887 came into contact with Karl Lueger, joining the latter's Christian Socialist Party ("Christlichsozialen Partei") when it was founded in 1891. Aloys, Lueger, Vogelsang and Franz Martin Schindler met regularly at the "Hotel Zur goldenen Ente" (Golden Duck, Riemergasse 4) in Vienna's First District, and would refer to their meetings as "Enten-Abende" (Duck Evenings). This working group became the focus for social reform and they organised the Second Austrian Katholikentag in 1889. From this Schindler developed the platform of the fledgling Christian Socialist Party. 
He represented the party in parliament until 1911. He worked to bring the Catholic Conservatives and Christian Socialists into a coalition between 1896-1907 to keep the liberals in opposition. After Lueger's death in 1910, he became chair of the party. 
From 1906-1918 he was Marshal of Lower Austria. In 1911 he was appointed to the Upper House ("Herrenhaus") but progressively withdrew from public life due to ill health. He resigned all offices in 1918. His campaigns for social reform, religious schools ("Konfessionsschulen") and religious law was in the Spirit of Pope Leo XIII. 
Like Lueger, he was considered an Anti-Semite.
He is buried in a dedicated grave in Vienna's central cemetery, the Zentralfriedhof (32A, 54).
Marriage and issue.
He married firstly in London on 27 June 1872 Marie Fox, adopted daughter of Henry Edward Fox, 4th Baron Holland and wife Lady Mary Augusta Coventry, and had issue, four daughters. He married secondly in Vienna on 20 May 1890 Johanna Elisabeth Maria von Klinkosch (Vienna, 13 August 1849 - Baden bei Wien, 31 January 1925), daughter of the master silversmith Josef Carl Ritter von Klinkosch and his wife Elise Swoboda, without issue.

Teddy Nelson

Teddy Nelson (born "Terje Nielsen", August 23, 1939 - died June 8, 1992) was a Norwegian country music artist, best known for his hit singles "Diggy Liggy Lo", "Bonde ifrå Hamlagrø" and "Skilsmisseferd i Hardanger", and his collaborations with American country music singer Skeeter Davis.
Biography.
Early years.
Nelson was born Terje Nielsen in Bergen on August 23, 1939. His parents were from Fana outside Bergen, and he descended from Danish immigrants on his fathers side. Nelson grew up in Totlandsveien, a few minutes east of Fana, as a typical middle-class boy in post-war Norway. He started playing the guitar at early age, and formed his first band when he was 16 years old, in 1955, playing local clubs and gatherings. In 1964, aged 25, Nelson was signed to Columbia EMI, and recorded his first single, "Oh, Susie Be Mine" with his band "the Apaches". Ten more singles followed until 1974, whilst Nelson continued playing local venues and gigs in most of Western Norway. He quickly made his mark in the Norwegian country music scene as the first artist to bring humour into the otherwise dark and dim lyrics and songs, and for his nasal vocal performance, and became a popular attraction for country music venues and festivals.
In 1975, he was selected by Johannes Kleppevik (who at the time was known as a songwriter rather than a performer of his own) as one of three local singers (alongside Davy Dean and Clive Scott) to perform on his album "A Little Bit of Heaven", where the three singers performed songs written by Kleppevik, with four songs each on the 12-track record.
First albums.
In 1974, Nelson entered the studio in Bergen to record what was originally planned to be a new set of singles. Backing him up was Flying Norwegians, the newly formed country rock group who would later become famous in their own right. During the two weeks of recording, four songs were put on tape, with the intention of making two seven-inch singles. Guitarist Cato Sanden, however, suggested that Nelson save the songs for an album instead of making more singles, which Nelson agreed to do. Nelson soon after secured a record deal with Triola to release his first long play album. The remainder of the album was recorded over the next two years, with Løvstakken String Band backing Nelson for three songs, and Flying Norwegians returning in early 1976 to help record eight more songs.
The debut album, "Diggy Liggy", was released in the fall of 1976 and became an instant hit, reaching #1 on the Norwegian Albums Chart and achieving a silver record, as well as being the best-selling country record of the year. The album contained two of his best-selling and best-known songs, "Diggy Liggy Lo" and "Bonde ifrå Hamlagrø", who both received lots of airplay. The success prompted Nelson to go on a supporting tour, and he was soon contacted by Triola who wanted a follow-up record. In November 1977, Nelson returned to the studio with Flying Norwegians, and recorded his second album, "Jippi tai ooh..." in just five days, as most of the songs had already been played live and as such little rehearsal was needed. It was then rush-released in time for the christmas market, with the record hitting shelves on December 10, 1977. Following the albums release, Nelson opted out of another tour, instead returning to the studio with Flying Norwegians soon after whilst his previous albums were still best sellers. Wanting to broaden his audience, Nelson decided to recorded songs only in English, and in a style more similar to his supporting band, Flying Norwegians', previous albums. The result was "Point of Departure", Nelsons first English language record and the only one where Flying Norwegians received first credit alongside Nelson, released on the international label Sonet in favor of Triola in order to reach audiences outside of Norway.
In 1979, Nelson returned to Triola and recorded his eponymous fourth album, his best-selling album and final efforts with Flying Norwegians. The albums lead single, "Oksefestival" reached Top 10 on the Norwegian singles charts, while the album later reached Top 3 and got Nelson his second silver record.
Nashville recordings.
In 1980, after increased attention outside Norway, Nelson travelled to the United States after being invited by Skeeter Davis to perform in Nashville. Here he recorded two albums in one set of sessions, "Weaver of Dreams" and "Nashville in My Heart", which were released the same year. He was soon after invited to perform at the Grand Ole Opry, as the first and only Scandinavian artist to receive this honour. Here he was also named «International Star of the Year» in both 1981 and 1982, and was also given many local country music awards both in Nashville, TN and Denver, CL.
Return to Norway.
Nelson soon returned to Norway, and recorded three more albums the next years; "I Lusekofte og Sixpence" in 1981, "Lookin' For The Good Times" in 1983, and "Honky Tonk Man" in 1985. The latter gave Nelsons his biggest hit single, "Skilsmisseferd i Hardanger", his first Norwegian language song in four years, which reached #1 in 1985 and received massive airplay on Norwegian radio. Following this, he was named "Entertainer of the Year" by Norwegian radio station "P2" for three consecutive years in 1985, -86 and -87. In 1986, he then recorded and released his tenth album, the appropriately named ""10 Teddy"", which failed to trumph the success of his previous record and went largely unnoticed.
Final albums.
In 1989, after three years of touring and a long break from recording, Nelson returned to Nashville once again to make his eleventh album. "American Dreamer" was released soon after, and Nelson was named "Male Singer of the Year" at the "Country Music Roundup" in London, the highest recognition of country music in Europe, for the album. Commenting on the award, many producers credited Nelson as a leading figure who made way for «the modern Nashville sound».
Following the albums release, Nelson resumed his previous collaboration with Skeeter Davis, and she accompanied him for his tours in the US and Norway. Nelson kept both feet on the ground, however, and preferred to play the local venues and town halls in favor of the larger stadiums and concert venues. In 1990 he returned to the studio once again, recording in sessions both in Norway and the US. The result was "Millions of Miles", with the titular song, a duet with Davis, being a top selling single both in Norway and the US that year. The following year, Nelson and Davis recorded together once again, this time making a full album of duets entitled ""You Were Made For Me"", which was released in early 1991.
Illness and death.
In 1991, Nelson was diagnosed with cancer after feeling ill for a period of time. Despite the exhausting treatments for the illness, Nelson continued touring when he was well enough to perform. On June 8, 1992, Nelson was schedueled to perform in Ålborg, Denmark. When his band members came to get him in the dressing room before the show, they found that he had died peacefully while resting, aged 52. He was buried in Sandefjord, where he lived, on August 16, 1992.
Legacy.
Since his death, Nelson has been given tributes by both his son, Rudi Nielsen, who performs with his own band playing his fathers songs. He also performed with his father from 1979-1992. Norwegian group Vassendgutane has also done covers of Nelsons songs both on records and live, with two of the members in the band being former band members in Nelsons own touring band.
During their 1995-96 and 2005 reunion tours, Flying Norwegians would often play some of Nelsons early songs, with Cato Sanden assuming vocal duties.
Personal life.
Nelson lived most of his life in the outskirts of Bergen, where he grew up, but moved to Sandefjord a few years before his death. Nelson had two children, including a son, Rudi Nelson, who recorded and toured with his father from 1979 to 1992, and afterwards began a solo career performing his fathers songs.

Local Motion (company)

Local Motion, Inc. ("Local Motion") is a transportation software and hardware company that builds intelligent networks of shareable vehicles. Founded by John Stanfield and Clément Gires in 2010, the company is based in San Mateo, CA.
History.
Co-founders John Stanfield and Clément Gires met at Stanford University in 2010 while pursuing master's degrees. Stanfield previously co-founded two small businesses, Perfect Shine and Veggie Wheels. As his master's thesis project for the Joint Program in Design, he and several classmates designed and built a low-speed electric vehicle, which they called the Weng (short for "Where Everyone Needs to Go"). Gires also had previous experience in vehicle design, having helped to build a 1000 mpg car in France. After graduation, Stanfield and Gires worked together to build a second low-speed electric vehicle as part of the Lemnos Labs hardware incubator program in San Francisco. The newer version of the Weng was designed to be shareable and interactive as well as energy efficient. In 2012, the company changed its name from Weng Motors, Inc. to Local Motion, Inc., and switched its focus from designing vehicles to building software and hardware capable of connecting existing vehicles to local transportation networks. In the summer of 2012, the company began targeting fleets on corporate campuses as an initial sales channel, launching pilot networks on several corporate campuses in Silicon Valley.
Product.
Local Motion builds software and hardware designed to connect vehicles of all types to local networks. These networks are intended to increase the efficiency and usage of vehicles and facilitate fleet management and ride sharing. Local Motion aims to distinguish itself from competitors by focusing on two-way information flow and interactivity between users and vehicles. Gires defines the company's approach to transportation as providing both "information and service."
The company retrofits existing vehicles with hardware that interacts with users and other vehicles, gathers data about transportation patterns and user behavior, and transmits charge, health and location information back to the central network. The online booking platform lets users view schedules, book reservations and share rides. A separate platform allows fleet managers to monitor the status of vehicles, add or remove vehicles and users, oversee repairs, and resize or redistribute their fleets based on usage patterns.

List of Members of the United States House of Representatives in the 20th Congress by seniority

This is a list of members of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 20th United States Congress by seniority. For the most part, representatives are ranked by the beginning of their terms in office.
As an historical article, the districts and party affiliations listed reflect those during the 20th Congress (March 4, 1827 – March 3, 1829). Seats and party affiliations on similar lists for other Congresses will be different for certain members.
This article describes the criteria for seniority in the House of Representatives and sets out the list of members by seniority. It is prepared on the basis of the interpretation of seniority applied to the House of Representatives in the 112th Congress. In the absence of information to the contrary, it is presumed that the twenty-first-century practice is identical to the seniority customs used during the 20th Congress.
House seniority.
Seniority in the House, for Congressmen with unbroken service, depends on the date on which the members first term began. That date is either the start of the Congress (March 4 in odd numbered years, for the era up to and including the 73rd Congress starting in 1933) or the date of a special election during the Congress. Since many members start serving on the same day as others, ranking between them is based on alphabetical order by the last name of the congressman.
Congressmen, in early Congresses, were often elected after the legal start of the Congress. Such representatives are attributed with unbroken seniority, from the legal start of the congressional term, if they were the first person elected to a seat in a Congress. The date of the election is indicated in a note.
The seniority date is normally taken from the members entry in the "Biographical Directory of the United States Congress", except where the date given is the legal start of the Congress and the actual election (for someone who was not the first person elected to the seat in that Congress) was later. The date of election is taken from "United States Congressional Elections 1788-1997". In a few instances the latter work provides dates, for the start and end of terms, which correct those in the Biographical Directory. 
The Biographical Directory normally uses the date of a special election, as the seniority date. However, mostly in early Congresses, the date of the member taking his seat can be the one given. The date of the special election is mentioned in a note to the list below, when that date is not used as the seniority date by the Biographical Directory. 
Representatives who returned to the House, after having previously served, are credited with service equal to one less than the total number of terms they served. When a representative has served a prior term of less than two terms (i.e. prior term minus one equals less than one), he is ranked above all others whose service begins on the same day.
Leadership.
In this Congress the only formal leader was the Speaker of the House. A Speakership election was held on December 3, 1827. Andrew Stevenson (J-VA) defeated John W. Taylor (A-NY), the Speaker in the last Congress, to be elected on the first ballot.
The title Dean of the House (sometimes known, in the nineteenth century, as Father of the House) was held by the member with the longest continuous service. It was not a formal leadership position.
Standing Committees.
The House created its first standing committee, on April 13, 1789. There were twenty-seven standing committees, listed in the rules used by the 20th Congress.
Committees, in this period, were normally appointed for a session at a time by the Speaker. However the resolution of March 30, 1816, which created the committees on departmental expenditures and Expenditures on Public Buildings, provided for those standing committees to be appointed for the whole Congress.
This list refers to the standing committees of the House in the 20th Congress, the year of establishment as a standing committee, the number of members assigned to the committee and the dates of appointment in each session (or if appropriate for the Congress), the end of the session (if appropriate) and its chairman. Chairmen, who were reappointed after serving at the end of the previous Congress, are indicated by an *. 
The first session was December 3, 1827 – May 26, 1828 (175 days) and the second session was December 1, 1828 – March 3, 1829 (93 days).
List of Representatives by seniority.
A numerical rank is assigned to each of the 213 members initially elected to the 20th Congress. Other members, who were not the first person elected to a seat but who joined the House during the Congress, are not assigned a number.
Eight representatives-elect were not sworn in. One resigned before the Congress started (DE-al:McLane). Seven more left the Congress before it convened. Three members-elect died (KY-11:Young, ME-1:Burleigh. OH-8:Wilson) and four resigned (GA-1:Tatnall, GA-2:Forsyth, MA-1:Webster, NY-29:Evans). The list below includes the representatives-elect (with name in italics), with the seniority they would have held if sworn in.
Party designations, of Representatives, used in this article are A for Adams (a supporter of President John Quincy Adams) and J for Jacksonian (an ally of Andrew Jackson). Territorial Delegates have not been given a party label, as the "Biographical Directory" does not specify a party for Delegates in this Congress. Designations used for past service, in the 4th to 18th Congresses, are (DR) for Democratic-Republican members and (F) for Federalist representatives. For the 18th Congress only, each party is further divided based upon the Presidential candidates supported. The prefixes used are A- for Adams-Clay supporters, C- for the followers of Crawford and J- for the Jackson men.

Those Who Dance

Those Who Dance is a 1930 American Pre code crime film produced and distributed by Warner Bros. and directed by William Beaudine. It stars Monte Blue, Lila Lee, William "Stage" Boyd and Betty Compson and is a remake of a 1924 silent film that starred Bessie Love and Blanche Sweet. The story, written by George Kibbe Turner, was based on events which actually took place among gangsters in Chicago.
Synopsis.
Monte Blue plays as a police detective who is after a famous gangster (played by William Boyd). He disguses himself and lives in the very house of the famous gangster by pretending he is an out of town gangster who has just murdered someone. He pretends he is the sweetheart of an innocent girl (played by Lila Lee) who suspects her brother has been framed for murder by Monte Blue. Blue's moll, played by Betty Compson, is also in on the conspiracy as she had become fed up with his cheating, lying and brutal treatment. The life of Lee's brother depends, who has been sentenced to the chair, depends on them getting evidence against Boyd.
Foreign Language Versions.
Foreign Language Versions were made in Spanish ("Los Que Danzan"), German ("Der Tanz Geht Weiter") and French ("Contre-Enquête"). They are all apparently lost. Also apparently lost is the original 1924 silent version upon which the 1930 versions were based.
Pre-Code Material.
The film contains a lot of pre-code material. Some examples include: Lila Lee's character is called "a professional virgin." Two unmarried couples live together, with the unspoken understanding that this is not true love forever, just a temporary situation for the sake of convenient sex for all parties concerned and hot meals on the table for the men as long as the situation lasts. There is also a gay reference about a man being "that way" about Tim Brady (played by William Janney), etc.
Preservation.
The film survives complete. It was transferred unto 16mm film by Associated Artists Productions in the 1950s and shown on television. A 16mm copy is housed at the Wisconsin Center for Film & Theater Research. Another print exists at the Library of Congress.

Social Research and Demonstration Corporation

The Social Research and Demonstration Corporation (SRDC) is an independent non-profit and non-partisan social policy research organization based in Canada, with a focus on designing, implementing and evaluating large-scale demonstration projects.
The organization helps policy-makers and practitioners develop and identify policies and programs that are effective, with the goal of raising the standards of evidence used in assessing the effectiveness of policies. Their work encompasses a wide variety of social policy domains, including education, literacy training, child development, community building, income security programs and population health. SRDC designs, implements, operates and evaluates these projects with an emphasis on the Canadian public policy context.
History.
SRDC was established in 1991 at the request of the Canadian federal government's Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) as an arm's length research organization capable of implementing long-term, multi-site demonstration projects. Since then, SRDC has completed close to 150 projects and studies on behalf of federal, provincial and regional governments, as well as other public and non-profit organizations. They operate across Canada, with offices in Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver. 
Their most recent initiative includes being mandated by the Government of British Columbia to implement a new Centre for Employment Research, set to launch in the fall of 2012. The role of the centre, according to the BC government, will be to "support the employment services sector, including employers and service providers, with the goal of improving outcomes for all unemployed job seekers in the province." The centre will encompass a research and development program and a systemic approach for sharing best practices throughout the sector. It will act as a single coordination point for employment research and innovation, as well as training in best practices. 
Other large-scale projects conducted by SRDC include Life After High School in Ontario, a provincially government-funded pilot project to provide Grade 12 students at selected Ontario secondary schools with practical support applying for post-secondary education and financial aid. Another example is Upskill: Essential to Excel, a project using random assignment design to measure the impacts of LES training on workers' skills, their job performance, and other outcomes relevant to works and firm-level objectives.
Earlier SRDC research includes The Self-Sufficiency Project, which randomly assigned single-parent, long-term welfare recipients into a program group and a comparison group. Program group members could receive a subsidy in exchange for their leaving welfare in favour of full-time work. The subsidy was available for three years, but only to people who began working full-time within 12 months of random assignment. The resulting paper was the recipient of the Frisch Medal Award, an honor bestowed every two years for an applied article (empirical or theoretical) published in Econometrica during the previous five-year period. 
In 2000, SRDC was presented with the Outstanding Research Contribution Award by the Policy Research Secretariat.
Select publications.
The SRDC website hosts a wide variety of publications on social policy that were conducted on behalf of federal, provincial and municipal government and non-profit clients. Included below is a small sample:

Ossory (horse)

Ossory (1885-1889) was a Thoroughbred racehorse. He was trained at Kingsclere by John Porter for the 1st Duke of Westminster. As a three-year-old he won the Prince of Wales's Stakes and St. James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot.
Breeding.
Ossory was a full-brother to the unbeaten Triple Crown winner Ormonde. Both being sons of Epsom Derby winner Bend Or and Doncaster Cup winner Lily Agnes. Like his brother Ormonde, Ossory was a roarer.
Racing career.
Ossory only raced once as a two-year-old, winning the Criterion Stakes at Newmarket. He started as a 50/1 outsider for the 2000 Guineas and finished last out of the six runners. He then went to Royal Ascot for the Prince of Wales's Stakes. Starting at odds of 10/1 Ossory pulled away in the last 100 yards to win by three lengths from Galore. Ossory and Galore met again at the Royal meeting, this time over a mile in the St. James's Palace Stakes where only the two lined up. With 300 yards to go the two horses were level and then Galore began to edge ahead, but in the closing strides Ossory came back at him and the race finished in a dead heat.
Ossory next started in the Eclipse Stakes. Starting at 100/6 and ridden by Tom Cannon junior he led the field of thirteen in the opening stages of the race. Three furlongs into the race he had a sizeable lead, but stablemate Orbit had closed the gap as they entered the finishing straight. By the time they entered the final 100 yards Orbit had taken the lead, which he gradually increased to win by a length from Ossory, with Martley a further length back in third place. Ossory then finished unplaced in the Sussex Stakes. His next race came in at York where he started as the 5/4 joint favourite for the Great Yorkshire Stakes. Ossory led his two rivals into the finishing straight and neither were able to catch him, leaving Ossory to win by a length from Arrandale. He made the running in the St Leger Stakes and finished unplaced.
Death.
After the 1888 season Ossory was sold for stud duties and exported to South America. He left in January 1889, but while on the journey they experienced severe weather conditions in the Atlantic Ocean. As a result of this Ossory died from exhaustion and was thrown overboard.
Pedigree.

Octave Penguilly L'Haridon

Octave Penguilly l'Haridon (18 April 1811 - 3 November 1872) was a French painter known for his works depicting Breton landscape, myths and history. He was also curator of the military Musée de l'Artillerie (Museum of Armaments) in Paris.
Career.
Originally from Pleyben, in Brittany, Penguilly l'Haridon trained to become an artillery officer in the French military. However, by 1835, was also taking drawing lessons. By the 1840s he was designing illustrations for books, generally on Breton topics.
Curatorial work.
After retiring from active military service, in 1854 he was appointed as curator of the "Musée de l'Artillerie" in Paris, a position he retained for many years. In this capacity he helped to defend the authenticity of ancient flint tools discovered in Pressigny-le-Grand. In 1862 he wrote and published a comprehensive catalogue of the museum's collection, including an account of the origins and history of the museum itself.
Art.
He showed works in various exhibitions throughout his life. Though generally considered an exponent of academic art, he could also be experimental. In 1859 he showed at the Salon a landscape entitled "Les Petites mouettes" ("Little Gulls") (1858, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rennes), depicting a bleak rocky inlet on Belle Île. The subject, composition and the colours of the work are in complete break with the established convention. The picture was praised by Maxime du Camp and Charles Baudelaire, who referred to the sense of the uncanny, as though the rocks make "a portal open to infinity...a "wound" of white birds, and the solitude!"
Many of his works were inspired by the Breton landscape and the region's history. Several were used as illustrations in books on the region. His most notable work is the historical painting "Combat des Trente" (1857, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Quimper). The elaborate frieze-like composition portrays the Combat of the Thirty a famous episode in medieval chivalry during the Breton War of Succession. It depicts a late stage in the battle, when the dazed and exhausted combatants continue to hack away at one another on the verge of total collapse. The "Revue française" saw it as an example of L'Haridon's genuine interest in medieval culture, but objected that, This is not history herself: living, human, full-blooded [...]. Skillful, ingenious, knowledgeable, well informed about all matters medieval... it lacks the most important quality - life.
Penguilly L'Haridon increasingly became interested in combining history with science. He painted a picture entitled "Stone Age" representing primeval culture. He chose to reform traditional religious iconography in his painting "Les bergers, conduits par l'étoile, se rendent à Bethléem", depicting the shepherds led by the star to travel to Bethlehem (1863, Musée d'Orsay). Indeed, the shepherds are represented here as modern Bedouins with their dogs, and the "Bethlehem" to which they travel is a small settlement in the desert, indicated by the star. His version of the arrival of the Magi is equally unusual, portraying another desert-like foreground, with the Magi arriving in a procession in the middle distance, led by an Indian elephant.

Conscription in Brazil

In Brazil, conscription is mandatory for every male who has just turned 18 years old. It normally lasts for twelve months. However, due to the excess of contingency, most end up being exempted.
Military service was first made mandatory in 1906, during Afonso Pena's government, when Hermes da Fonseca was Minister of War. It would only be fully implemented during World War I though, when military personnel in the country were made necessary.
Conscription in Brazil is currently regulated by the "Lei do Serviço Militar" (Military Service Law), created on August 17, 1964, by then-president Castello Branco. According to the law, every male is subjected to military service from January 1 of the year in which he turns 18 until December 31 of the year in which he turns 45. In case of a war, this period may be altered, according to the demands. 17-year old are allowed to undergo military service, as volunteers.
Boys must enlist for conscription in the year they turn 18. Once a citizen is exempted, he is given one of the following documents: Certificado de Alistamento (commonly known as CAM); Certificado de Reservista; Certificado de Isenção; or Certificado de Dispensa de Incorporação. Without these documents, he won't be able to obtain a passport, enroll in any educational institution nor be admitted as an employee in any company whose operations depend on the authorization of federal, state or municipal government.

Escola Valls Futbol is a Spanish football club from Valls, Tarragona best known for its women's team, formerly known as CFF Tortosa-Ebre and Gimnàstic Tarragona, which currently plays in Segunda División. Other than it, the club is centered in formative football.
CFF Tortosa-Ebre played in the second tier between 1995 and 2009, mostly ranking in the middle positions. When RFEF decided to expand the Superliga Femenina with male clubs, Gimnàstic Tarragona bought CFF Tortosa and registered in the premier category. The original club was thus disbanded and relocated from Tortosa to Tarragona.
In its debut season Gimnàstic established a negative record by losing all 24 games, but it was spared from relegation as there were none. The team attained its first victory, a 3–2 win over UE L'Estartit, in the next season's week 2. However, a 16-games losing streak followed, sinking it in the bottom places. Gimnàstic ended the season 3rd to last with 3 wins and 1 draw in 28 games, and was relegated to the second tier. 
Following the relegation the club decided to register the team in the third tier instead of the second tier without considering promotion for financial reasons. However, two weeks later the team was handed over to Escola Valls Fútbol, which registered in the second tier. In its debut season representing Valls the team was its group's runner-up 5 points from the promotion play-offs, its best result in the category.

<doc id="36844297" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36844297" title="William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart">
William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart

William Murray, first Earl of Dysart (1600 ?-1655), was the childhood whipping boy of Charles I of England and later, an adviser to the king.
Early life.
Born about 1600, Murray was son of William Murray (1561 ?-1616), minister of Dysart, Fifeshire, by his wife Margaret. The father was a younger brother of Murray of Woodend, and was descended from a younger son of the family of Dollarie, which was a branch of the house of Tullibardine. William's uncle, Thomas Murray, took his nephew to court when a boy, and educated him along with Prince Charles. The latter and Murray were about the same age, and became very intimate.
Service to Charles.
In 1626, Charles appointed him one of the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber, and retained him in his service ever afterwards. Charles granted Murray the lease of Ham House, close to the palace at Richmond, London and conveniently situated for access to the palaces in London, Hampton Court and Windsor and it was here that Murray established his family.
Murray had great influence with Charles, both as an adviser and in procuring favours for others. He was closely related to some of the leading covenanters—his uncle was the Rev. Robert Murray, minister of Methven from 1615 to 1648, whose daughter married George Gillespie—and Murray was a medium of private negotiations between them and the king. Montrose affirmed that Murray had sent to the Scots at Newcastle in October 1640 copies of private letters which he had written to the king, then at York. He accompanied Charles to Scotland in 1641, and having got access to Montrose (who was then a prisoner in Edinburgh Castle, by order of the covenanters) he carried communications from one to the other. After encouraging the impeachment of Hamilton and Argyll, it is said that Murray informed them of their danger, and hence their flight. At this time, Murray stood high in favour with the Scottish church, for soon after the king's return to England the commission of assembly besought Charles to "lay on him the agenting of the affairs of the church about his majesty." It was generally believed that Murray told his friend, Lord Digby, of the king's intention to arrest the five members of the House of Commons, and that Digby betrayed the secret.
Civil War.
On the outbreak of the First English Civil War, Murray was sent by the king to Montrose to inform him and other friends in Scotland of the state of his affairs, and to procure their advice and help. In 1645, Murray was with Queen Henrietta Maria of France in Paris, and was employed by her in her negotiations on the king's behalf with foreign powers, and with the Pope. On his return to England in February 1646, he was seized as a spy in passing through Canterbury, and was sent as a prisoner to the Tower of London, where he remained till summer, when he was released through the influence of the Scots commissioners in London, who urged "that he had done good offices to many of the best ministers in Scotland."
He was allowed to go to the king, then at Newcastle, on the assurance of his countrymen that he would do all in his power to induce his master to yield to the conditions of the parliament. In September, Charles wrote to the queen, "William Murray is let loose upon me from London. ... As for religion, he and I are consulting for the best means how to accommodate it without going directly against my conscience. ... We are consulting to find such a present compliance as may stand with conscience and policy." In October, Murray was sent back to London on a secret mission, which he undertook at some risk of "putting his neck to a new hazard," but on his return he informed the king "that the Scots commissioners hindered him to do anything therein for the little hope he could give them of his ratifying the covenant." Soon after he and Sir Robert Murray made arrangements for the king's flight, but when the critical moment came Charles changed his mind. After the king was given up to the English, Murray was forbidden his presence, and returned to the continent.
Later life.
In 1648, Henrietta Maria sent him to Scotland to further 'the engagement,' and to persuade his countrymen to receive the Prince of Wales, whom she wished to take part in the effort for the deliverance of the king. He first tried to induce Argyll and the dominant party in the church to support the resolutions of the Scottish estates, but, failing in this, he took counsel with the Duke of Hamilton and his friends, and in May, he returned to the continent with letters from them formally inviting the prince to Scotland.
Among those who gathered round Charles II at the Hague immediately after his father's death, Lord Byron mentions "old William Murray, employed here by Argyll." After the Scots commissioners returned unsatisfied in June 1649 from their visit to the Dutch Republic, Charles sent over William Murray with private letters to Argyll and Loudoun. It is to this period apparently that John Livingston refers in his 'Autobiography' when he says that William Murray and Sir Robert Moray, who had long been very intimate with Argyll, 'put him in hopes that the king might marry his daughter.'
In 1650, when the Scots commissioners were treating with Charles at Breda, Murray was sent with instructions to them, and in May of that year Sir William Fleming, who carried letters from Charles to Montrose, with whom he was still in correspondence, was directed to advise with William Murray and others as to whether Montrose should still keep the field or not. This goes to show that Murray abetted and shared in the king's duplicity. Burnet says that Murray was "very insinuating, but very false, and of so revengeful a temper that rather than any of the counsels given by his enemies should succeed he would have revealed them and betrayed both the king and them. It was generally believed that he had betrayed the most important of all his king's secrets to his enemies. He had one particular quality, that when he was drunk, which was very often, he was upon a most exact reserve, though he was pretty open at all other times." The last statement does not seem very credible, but the attempt to please both his royal master and the extreme covenanters was not compatible with straightforwardness.
Ennoblement.
He received his earldom from Charles I at Oxford in 1643, or, as Burnet says, at Newcastle in 1646, when he persuaded the king to antedate it by three years. As the patent did not pass the great seal, he ranked as a commoner till 1651, when, according to Lament's 'Diary,' several of the gentry were ennobled by Charles II, and among them 'William Murray of the bedchamber, who was made Lord Dysart.'
Family.
He married Catharine Bruce, granddaughter of Sir Robert Bruce of Clackmannan and Margaret Murray of the Tullibardine family, and had four daughters. The first, Elizabeth, born in 1626, inherited her father's title and later became duchess of Lauderdale. Anne and Catherine never married, but Murray's youngest daughter, Margaret, married William Maynard, 2nd Baron Maynard.
Death.
Murray was thought by some to have died in exile in France, and an early biographer believed him to have died in 1651. However, it is known that he died in Edinburgh in December 1655 and his cousin, Thomas Murray, a Scottish lawyer, drew up reports for his daughters.

Jolson Tonight

Jolson Tonight is a musical with a book by Nicholas Dante. The musical is based off the life of Al Jolson.
Background.
Nicholas Dante was hired by producer Jeff Britton to write "Jolson Tonight" after his previous Al Jolson musical, "Joley", failed in spring 1979. The show was written in a similar fashion to "A Chorus Line", Dante's previous musical, by having a series of recorded conversations with star Larry Kert about the public and private life of Al Jolson. 
The show was doing a pre-Broadway trial in five cities in the 1980 in preparation for a run on Broadway. The backers audition was held in July 1979 to about 200 spectators. Rehearsals started in June 1980, and the cost was $1.4 million with a cast of 30. The show opened on July 21, 1980 in Indianapolis. The tryout was supposed to play there for a week followed by week-long runs in Kansas City, New Orleans, St. Louis and Tulsa. The set was designed by Michael Bottari and Ronald Case, who along with director Michael Shawn created many of the visual concepts. The costumes were designed by Donna Granata.
The creative team included Pierre Cardin, a fashion deisgner, who was trying to get the show to Broadway, produced by Salvatore Pirrone, directed and choreographed by Michael Shawn, and starring Larry Kert.
The show is said to have closed because no Broadway theatres were available at the time.

Lady Gaga Fame

Lady Gaga Fame is a unisex perfume by American performance artist Lady Gaga. It was released in Guggenheim Museum and in Macy's stores in the United States and a range of different stores in the United Kingdom on August 22, 2012, and worldwide in September through the singer's Haus Laboratories label in association with Coty, Inc. According to promotional materials, the perfume uses "push-pull technology", rather than the pyramidal structure traditional of perfumes, to combine notes of "Atropa Belladonna", Tiger Orchid, Incense, Apricot, Saffron and Honey. As of 2013, the perfume sold more than 30 million bottles and earned more than 1.5 billion dollars worldwide.
Development.
In July 2010, British magazine "Marketing" reported that singer Lady Gaga had begun working on an "unusual" fragrance with Coty, Inc., set for release around Christmas of that year and to be accompanied by a large advertising campaign. "I know nothing of this project," Coty Beauty vice president Steve Mormoris said at the time. "It is a totally false rumor." Months later, in September, Mormoris announced that the singer had agreed to a long-term licensing deal allowing Coty to release fragrances under her name, with the first perfume expected to be released in spring 2012. In October 2010, website TMZ reported that a trademark was filed for the name "Monster" for the specific use of perfumery. In June 2012, Coty announced in a press release that the perfume would be titled Lady Gaga Fame.
Scent and packaging.
Reports circulated in early 2011 that Gaga wanted the perfume to smell of blood and semen. However, the singer stated that while the perfume was based on the molecular structure of the two substances, it would not smell of them. She further explained that the blood element was based on a sample her own blood molecules to create "a sense of having me on your skin". Rather than blood and semen, she said that the perfume would smell like an "expensive hooker". The packaging lists the perfume's notes as "tears of belladonna, crushed heart of tiger orchidea with a black veil of incense, pulverized apricot and the combinative essences of saffron and honey drops". According to the product packaging, instead of the pyramidal structure used in most perfumes, Lady Gaga Fame uses "push-pull technology", where the ingredients demonstrate aspects of each note without precedence. Rather than utilizing top, middle, and base notes, the perfume is based on three accords – "dark" (containing the Belladonna notes), "sensual" (containing the honey, saffron, and apricot notes), and "light" (containing the Tiger Orchid notes) which come together to produce a floral, fruity scent.
The perfume references the allure of fame and fortune with its sweet scent and gold crown, a theme Gaga has often explored in her career; the inclusion of the poisonous belladonna, along with the black liquid, represent the dark or destructive effect fame can have on an individual. Gaga states on the back of the packaging that the perfume is "black, like the soul of fame". 
Uniquely, Fame is a black perfume that sprays clear and becomes invisible once airborne; according to the Coty press release, it is the first perfume to utilize such technology. The bottle, designed by Gaga and photographer Nick Knight, was described by "Billboard" magazine as "simple and unfussy" and "crowned with an edgy and alien-like gold cap". Many high personalities were surprised by the perfume's sophistication when compared to other celebrity scents. Two versions of the perfume were released: a less expensive version, which includes a smaller bottle with a plastic cap, while a more expensive "premiere edition", known as Le Masterpiece, includes a larger bottle with a solid metal cap.
Release, Promotion and Sale.
Lady Gaga Fame was released worldwide in September 2012 through Gaga's own Paris-based Haus Laboratories label in association with Coty. In the US, it was released in Macy's stores on August 22. The advertising campaign was directed and photographed by Steven Klein. The campaign has been compared to the movie "Gulliver's Travels". On 18 July 2012, a black and white short film titled, "Formulation", by Todd Tourso, Reggie Know, Rob English, Kenneth Robin was released. The two-minute short features attractive male models in various laboratory clothing mixing and boiling chemicals to create the fragrance. Gaga does not appear in the visual. Gaga appeared on the September 2012 cover of "Vogue" magazine to promote the perfume.
Promotional video.
On August 14, 2012, Gaga released a 30-second trailer of the Lady Gaga Fame commercial which uses her song "Scheiße" as background music. On August 23, 2012, a day after the official launch of the fragrance at Macy's, Lady Gaga aired a second follow-up commercial. It follows the same story line and features Gaga scratching off black ooze, representing her black eau de parfum, from the male model's face. At the end of the ad, Lady Gaga's "Gulliver pose" is transformed into a golden statue similar to the cap from Le Masterpiece. Later the same day, a third subsequent ad was premiered on TV. It features Gaga parading between two sets of male models. On one side there are partially nude men dressed in latex; on the other side are giant size male figures frontally clothed in a half-gown and nude at the side and seemingly at the back. Their faces are disguised by a plastic shield. The two "Gulliver" statues of Gaga are also featured, one with tiny men climbing all over her and the other cast in gold.
The complete commercial video debuted on September 13, 2012 at the Guggenheim Museum, in New York and was released online on the same day at Littlemonsters.com. It was directed by Steven Klein, who previously directed her music video for "Alejandro".

Network partition

A network partition refers to the failure of a network device that causes a network to be split.
For example, in a network with multiple subnets where nodes A and B are located in one subnet and nodes C and D are in another, a partition occurs if the switch between the two subnets fails. In that case nodes A and B can no longer communicate with nodes C and D.
Also it can also be explained in a manner that if suppose a system is partition tolerant it means that even after a system is partitioned into multiple sub-systems it should work exactly in the same fashion as if in a single system.

Doris Schoettler-Boll

Doris Schoettler-Boll (in German: Doris Schöttler-Boll; b. 1945 in Noerdlingen) is a German artist. She is known for her de-constructivist works that she initially described as a result of Photomontage and Collage.
Life & Work.
Studying art in Essen and Düsseldorf (with Josef Beuys).
In the 1960s, Doris Schoettler-Boll lived in Bochum where her husband Peter Schoettler was enrolled in the history department of the Ruhr University Bochum. She studied art at the Folkwang University of the Arts, an art academy in Essen. Simultaneously she was attending lectures in Bochum and was an avid "cinéaste" who spent much time seeing art films at the Bochum university film club.
Having graduated at the Folkwang academy, she continued her professional education at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (Düsseldorf art academy) as a student of Joseph Beuys from 1970 till 1974. Simultaneously she was a key rent strike activist in Bochum, and worked as an artist with the children of the people of the large ‘Girondelle’ tenement house who were continuing their rent-strike. She was bringing paper and crayons or water colors and encouraged the children to express their wishes and longings visually.
The Years in Paris.
When she had completed her studies at the Düsseldorf art academy, Doris Schoettller-Boll went to Paris with her husband who was a translator of works by Louis Althusser. Since the mid-1970s, she met Jacques Derrida, Pierre Macherey, Étienne Balibar and Louis Althusser, being occasionally invited to their homes together with Peter Schoettler. 
Before she went to Paris, she wrote Derrida that she was compelled to ‘steal’ his concept of deconstruction because it amounted to reductionism if she would describe her way of working simply as collage/montage. It was then, in the mid-1970s, that she started to work as a professional (‘free’ and ‘free-lance’) artist; something she continues to do.
A professional artist, curator, and feminist art teacher in Bremen.
In 1979, Doris Schoettler-Boll went to Bremen, working as an artist but also teaching art and art-related subjects at the University of Bremen from 1979 to 1986. Her courses and exhibitions focused largely on feminist and civil rights issues. An art project and parallel course focused on gender culminated in an exhibition titled "Hair – Or Looking for Traces of the Female" "(Haare, oder Spurensuche des Weiblichen)". 
Another project reflecting identity led to the exhibition "Photo Albums, Portraits, Mug Shots" "(Photoalbum, Porträtphotographie, Polizeiphotographie; 1980)". It predated a similarly focused exhibition in the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe ( ZKM Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie in Karlsruhe, Germany) by approximately two decades.
The courses on "Women and Art" (Frauen und Kunst) led to an exhibition with the same title (Frauen und Kunst, 1982) in the Weserburg museum, as well as a small catalogue. Since this point, Doris Schoettler-Boll, who collaborated with noted artists, has worked with children, housewives, students and budding artists.
Again, Essen.
In 1985, Doris Schöttler-Boll was invited to stay in Essen as Artist-in-residence. Here, she lived and worked in "Borbeck castle" (Schloss Borbeck). During her time in Borbeck she organized the exhibition "Unter einem Himmel (Beneath one and the same sky, 1988)," which received considerable media attention. The exhibition featured two artists at a time, a male and a female artist who shared aesthetic interests. The male/female juxtaposition was expected to let the public discover gender-specific traits in their work. Nan Hoover (1931-2008) exhibited together with Harald Falkenhagen, Doris Schoettler-Boll with Timm Ulrichs. Other participants were Tony Morgan, Eu Nim Ro, Norbert Schwontkowski, Toto Frima, etc.
In the summer of 1988, the jury (Atelier-Vergabegremium) of the municipal Museum Folkwang in Essen decided to give Doris Schoettler-Boll a specific form of support that had been awarded already to HA Schult and Herbert Lungwitz: a rent-free, timewise unlimited stay in a municipal ‘art house’ (Atelierhaus). Schult had been given a space at the former Kaiser Otto School. Schoettler-Boll was offered a space at the former Pestalozzi School. This ‘Atelier’ House had been a home for the sculptor Lungwitz “since the (early) 1980s.” She renovated the studio, and the space where she lives, at her own expenses and pays for heating and water only. But in return for the benefit of being a recipient of such support for artists (Kuenstlerfoerderung), she is very actively engaged in conceiving and organizing projects open to the public, most notably a series of presentations titled “Persons-Projects-Perspectives’ (since 9/9/1999). 
Since 1996 Doris Schoettler-Boll has been a member of the Westdeutsche Künstlerbund, the Federation of West German Artists.
In addition to her creative work, Doris Schöttler-Boll has been conceiving, organizing and curating art-related projects at the "Atelierhaus für Kunst, Medien und Kommunication" (Art house for the visual arts, media and communication) in Essen-Steele. She initiated and curated expositions of young and not so young artists, was the prime mover of art projects involving children and adolescents and invited such noted artists as Harun Farocki, Urs Jaeggi, D. E. Sattler etc. to present their ideas, talk about their work, and engage in debate with the public. These presentations (under the general title "Persons, Projects, Perspectives") focused on painting, film, literature, art theory and practice, the possibilities of "intervention" in society, the social situation of artists and the circumstances which further or negatively affect the creation of art.
Single Exhibitions (A Selection).
In August and September, 1987, Doris Schöttler-Boll had a noted solo exhibition at the Landesmuseum Bonn (the main museum of modern art in Bonn, then the capital of West Germany). The exhibition, entitled Dekonstruktionen oder vom Widersprechen in Bildern (Dekonstructions or Contradicting by way of images), was curated by Professor Klaus Honnef, an art historian focused on photo art / art photography. 
Subsequently, she also had solo-exhibitions at the "Clemens-Sels-Museum" in Neuss (the twin city of Düsseldorf, on the left bank of the Rhine) and at the "Museum Bochum" in Bochum, Germany.
Group Exhibitions (A Selection).
Other exhibitions (solo or group exhibitions) took place at the Kunstamt Neukoelln (Berlin), the Fotoforum Bremen (Bremen), the Steintorgalerie (Bremen), the Weserburg museum (Bremen), the Museum Ehrenhof (Düsseldorf), the Museum Gelsenkirchen (Gelsenkirchen), the Studio of Schloss Oberhausen (Oberhausen), the Stollwerkfabrik (Cologne), etc. 
Both the art journal "Weltkunst" (Global Art) and a feminist journal, EMMA (magazine) (edited by Alice Schwarzer) noted her exhibition in Neuss. 
The exhibition Toto Frima (Amsterdam) und Doris Schöttler-Boll (Bremen) that took place in the "Fotoforum,“ a museum in Bremen, was mentioned by "Fotomagazin" (Jg. 1984) and in "Bremische Chronik".
In Essen, the noted architect Werner Ruhnau who had already collaborated with Yves Klein when he did the new Musiktheater im Revier (situated at the Kennedy Square in Gelsenkirchen) chose Doris Schoettler-Boll and Monika Guenther as collaborating artists when he redesigned the Grillo Theater. 
In the summer of 2012, photocollages/montages of Doris Schoettler-Boll were shown at the "Staedtische Galerie Bremen" (Bremen municipal gallery) in an exhibition entitled Tiefenschaerfe that included works by Christian Boltanski, Remigiusz Borda, Pierre Boucher, Ger Dekkers, Harald Falkenhagen, Marikke Heinz-Hoek, Jaschi Klein, Claudia Medeiros Cardoso, Sigmar Polke, Norbert Schwontkowski, and Wols, among others. The opening speech was given by noted art historian Klaus Honnef.
Critique.
Professor Klaus Honnef, a noted expert on photography as an art form, presented a large solo exhibition of her work in Bonn, West Germany. Josef Beuys wrote about her artistic approach that it avoids both rigid Aestheticism and one-sided political statement. The merit of such an approach was considerable in his opinion.
Commenting on her works exhibited in 1987 in the Bonn Landesmuseum, Prof. Klaus Honnef explained that Schoettler-Boll “is aware of the secret seductive power of photography, which ‘we put our faith in,’ as André Bazin wrote. She knows about this fascination and yet, she does not succumb to it. But she does not high-handedly assume to possess that Archimedean theorem or position which would allow her to expose the illusionary quality of photographic worlds of images. She knows, after all, that these worlds reflect social existence and consciousness.” Honnef noted that the artist had made use of “fragments of commercial imagery” (Versatzstücke kommerzieller Bilderwelten) when she created the works chosen for the exhibition. “She relies on collage and montage and takes a photo of the result in order to close the gaps in the surface. Despite the fact that she uses a pair of scissors to destroy the original material, she never proceeds in an aggressive manner.”
Prof. Marianne Schuller discussed the assemblage that Schoettler-Boll had completed for the Grillo-Theater (rebuilt and modernized by the architect Werner Ruhnau). Schoettler-Boll’s work is dedicated to two tragic German dramatists, Heinrich von Kleist (1777-1811), a Prussian citizen driven to suicide by an utterly wrong socio-cultural reality, and Georg Büchner (1813-1837), the author of Woyzeck (an almost surreal play about a recruit driven nuts by superiors who finally ends up murdering the young woman he loves) – but also the author of the ‘Hessische Landbote (The Hessian Courier),’ a revolutionary pamphlet addressed to the poor of the countryside that was circulated anonymously in the Hessian region. Her work consists of several photo-collages & montages that are placed above the left entrance of the auditorium. Prof. Schuller writes that the images constituting this work (a work of related yet separate parts!) “do not visualize the invisible; they do not replace something that is missing in the texts / the writing” of playwrights. “I rather see in these works as such something that is invisible. It comes to light as a kind of grieving, which these images represent, and which becomes acute while we look at them.” 
Dietrich E. Sattler, a poet, critic and editor of the ‘historisch-kritische Hoelderlin-Ausgabe,’ a new, thorough edition of the collected works of Friedrich Hölderlin (1770-1843), wrote about one of her works, “The moment represented” in the work “never was nor will it ever be. The same is true of the (represented) space; it exists and does not exist. … This is the camera obscura by way of which the dream nests in the day. The strange space where this happens is the interstice (Zwischenraum). The time in which this happens is the ‘time in-between’ (Zwischenzeit). In this case, the camera obscura is nothing but the technical apparatus necessary for the simulation of the dream. It is the artificial enclave of night within day… We admire the intelligence of the artist who spurned the possibility to satisfy our expectations with deceptive surrogates of real light and who presented to us the conditions inside the peepshow box, as if she could destroy the illusion and dissolve the magic of the representational image which alienates us from living images…”

Godiva (horse)

Godiva (1937–1940) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse, best known for winning two Classics in 1940. The filly won six times from eight races in a racing career which lasted from 1939 until June 1940. After winning three times as a two-year-old she was unbeaten in 1940, winning the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket and a wartime substitute Oaks over one and a half miles at the same course a month later. Godiva died within five months of her final race. She has been described as one of the best British racemares of the 20th century.
Background.
Godiva was a bay mare bred by her owner Esmond Harmsworth who later became better known as Lord Rothermere. In 1938 Harmsworth sold off most of his bloodstock interests, but kept three horses, one of which was the yearling filly later named Godiva. One of the horses he sold was Godiva's pregnant dam Carpet Slipper. The foal being carried by Carpet Slipper was Windsor Slipper, the 1942 Irish Triple Crown winner. Godiva was from the second crop of foals sired by the 1933 Derby winner Hyperion, the first of whose six Sires' championships in 1940 was largely due to the filly's successes. As a grand-daughter of the broodmare Simon's Shoes, Godiva came from the same branch of Thoroughbred Family 5-h which later produced the notable stallions Sadler's Wells and Nureyev.
Godiva was sent into training with William Rose "Willie" Jarvis at his Egerton House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Godiva was a temperamental and difficult filly who often gave trouble at the starting gate, but she formed a strong bond with her teenage exercise rider Douglas Marks. When Jarvis's stable jockey John Crouch was killed in a flying accident in June 1939, it was decided that Marks would ride the filly in her races.
Racing career.
1939: two-year-old season.
Godiva was one of the best British two-year-olds of 1939, winning three of her five races. Her victories came in the Princess Royal Stakes at Kempton, the Bedford Stakes at Newmarket and the Stud Produce Stakes at Sandown Park. Her best performance, however, came in defeat when she was tried against colts in the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket on 1 November. She started poorly but ran on strongly at the finish to take third place behind the French-trained colts Djebel and Tant Mieux. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best two-year-olds, she was given a weight of 127 pounds, three pounds below the top-rated filly Golden Penny.
1940: three-year-old season.
Godiva made her three-year-old debut in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket. The outbreak of World War II led to strict restrictions on the sport. Many racecourses were closed, leading to important races being either abandoned or relocated. In 1940, the "New 1000 Guineas Stakes" was switched from its traditional home on Newmarket's Rowley Mile to the adjoining July Course. Godiva and the virtually unknown Marks started at odds of 10/1 in a field of eleven fillies, with Golden Penny, ridden by the champion jockey Gordon Richards being made odds on favourite. In the race, Godiva raced on the opposite side of the course from the main group and moved up to dispute the lead with Golden Penny two furlongs from the finish. Despite swishing her tail as she galloped (regarded as a sign of temperament), Godiva quickly went clear and won very easily by five lengths from Golden Penny, with Allure four lengths further back in third. Her time was more than two seconds faster than Djebel's winning time in the 2000 Guineas two days earlier. On her next appearance, Godiva was moved up in distance and beat Drawing Prize to win the Oaks Trial Plate over ten furlongs at Hurst Park.
With Epsom Downs Racecourse out of use, the Derby and Oaks of 1940 where scheduled to be run at Newbury Racecourse, but a late change of plan saw the races being switched to the Newmarket July Course. In the "New Oaks" on 13 June, Godiva was made 7/4 favourite against thirteen opponents. She behaved poorly before the race was left many lengths behind at the start. Marks steadily made up the ground until he drew level with the leaders three furlongs from the finish. Godiva moved into the lead and quickly went clear, travelling with such ease that Marks had time to turn in the saddle and shout "Come on!" to his more experienced rivals. Godiva won easing down by three lengths from Silverlace, with Valeraine four lengths back in third. For the second time she beat the colts on the clock: her winning time of 2:29.4 was 1.4 seconds faster than the time recorded by Pont l'Eveque in winning the New Derby over the same course and distance a day earlier. The win gave Marks a second Classic win on only his seventh ride of the year.
Prize money had been greatly reduced in 1940, and Godiva's wins in the 1000 Guineas and Oaks brought her owner only £5,544: Galatea had won a combined total of £15,935 for winning the same two races in 1939.
Retirement and death.
Racing was suspended in Britain during July and August 1940. Although there were hopes that Godiva would return for an autumn campaign, the filly was withdrawn from training and retired. She was sent to Ireland to begin a new career as a broodmare and was lodged at the Fort Union Stud in County Limerick. Shortly after her arrival she underwent an operation as a result of which she contracted septicaemia and died.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Godiva a "great" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks and the fifth best British-trained filly of the 20th century.

HP Cloud

HP Cloud is the set of cloud solutions available from Hewlett-Packard (HP) that offers public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, managed private cloud, and other cloud services. It is the combination of the previous HP Converged Cloud business unit and HP Cloud Services, which is the OpenStack based public cloud. It is used by enterprise organizations so they can combine public cloud services with their own internal IT resources to create hybrid clouds, or a mix of different cloud computing environments made up of private and public clouds.
History.
HP Converged Cloud was launched in April 2012.
HP Public Cloud was announced on March 14, 2011, and launched as a public beta on May 10, 2012. HP Fellow and MySQL author Brian Aker announced the Relational Database Service on stage at the 2012 MySQL User's Conference. The HP Public Cloud Beta that went live in May 2012 included OpenStack-based storage and content delivery network (CDN) components. HP Cloud Object Storage and HP Cloud CDN were moved into general availability on August 1, 2012. HP Cloud DNS as a Service was moved into general availability on July 1, 2013.
The two business units were merged in late 2013 and announced at the HP Discover event in Barcelona, Spain.
On May 7, 2014, HP announced the HP Helion portfolio of products and services, and stated that the company plans to invest over $1 billion in cloud over the next two years. HP Helion includes HP's existing cloud products, new OpenStack-based services, and both professional and support services to assist businesses in building and managing hybrid IT environments.
Cloud computing challenges.
Moving between clouds.
Business organizations that want to use cloud computing have a choice of using a private cloud, which is a cloud infrastructure run specifically for a single organization that it built itself or by a third-party; or a public cloud, whereby a service provider makes available applications, storage, and other resources to the general public. The first would opt for a private cloud for security peace of mind, while the web developer would choose a public cloud offering. Most companies would operate a mixture the two, also known as hybrid cloud delivery.
Employing a hybrid delivery cloud strategy For instance, a public cloud may be a more cost-effective service for the compute-intensive task of processing analytics, but the data would remain local, or private, to comply with regulations. Because a hybrid delivery strategy lets organizations run applications and services across different clouds, collocation, and data centers, an example benefit of such a delivery mechanism is that organizations can move an app from one geographic location to another in major storms.
There can by different types of hybrid clouds for specific tasks. The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model can be a hybrid cloud in that it could use operating systems and virtualization technologies from both a public and private cloud infrastructure to provide cloud services. Other models that mixes on-premises cloud with public cloud technologies include Platform as a Service (PaaS), which includes infrastructure services combined with development tools and middleware; and Software as a Service (SaaS), which is used to develop packaged software.
However, moving data in the cloud can be a difficult procedure. In the case of Software as a Service (SaaS), it is difficult particularly if the incumbent cloud provider used proprietary software, or if it altered an open source application.
A way to mitigate cloud migration difficulties is to architect applications for the cloud that reduce or eliminate the dependencies between the cloud application stack and the capabilities of the cloud service provider. Another way is to select only generic and higher-level applications to move to the cloud in the first place. Another method is to select open standards for cloud computing.
A best practice for avoiding cloud migration problems is to use a management platform that can support applications in any environment a user organization is likely to use. This has been described as using a "best-of-breed" approach.
Cloud professional services.
Companies engage cloud professional services consultants to help them plan how to incorporate cloud services into their business operations. Consultants advise businesses on whether to use public, private, or a hybrid delivery model, and how they should implement or consume those delivery models.
According to research conducted by HP in 2013, 43 percent of companies surveyed indicated that they wanted strategic guidance on how to deploy cloud. In a 2013 competitive vendor analysis report by International Data Corporation, a market research firm, the authors state that cloud professional services can help companies map out both a short-term and a long-term strategy for how to use cloud in a way that aids their business goals.
The most common reason businesses engage cloud professional services are for assistance with incorporating cloud technology into existing IT environments, and to plan how to implement cloud, according to a study published in February 2014 by the independent research firm Technology Business Research, Inc. According to published reports, the use of cloud professional services indicates that businesses do not have adequate internal resources that are knowledgeable about implementing cloud.
HP Cloud characteristics and components.
Converged infrastructure.
HP Cloud follows the premise of Converged infrastructure: the integration of compute, storage, and networking components and technologies into self-provisioning pools of shared resources, and supported by IT services.
Open standards.
HP Cloud is neutral regarding the manufacturer of cloud components used, such as virtual machine hypervisors, operating systems, and development environments.
HP Cloud is based on OpenStack. This allows user organizations to move cloud applications between HP cloud systems and other cloud systems based on OpenStack. The support for open standards technology enables user organizations to employ a hybrid delivery strategy for their cloud consumption. It also means private clouds based on converged infrastructure are compatible with public cloud platforms based on OpenStack, such as RackSpace and Nebula. The benefit is that user organization can decouple their applications from being tied to a particular hardware platform. User organizations may want to do this when they want to move key workloads to another Infrastructure-as-a-Service supplier.
Components.
HP CloudSystem is a component of HP Cloud. It enables user organizations to burst workloads to external or internal cloud resources in times of increased workloads or when they want additional compute resources.
Industry sector packages.
HP Cloud includes a number of packages for different industry sectors. For instance, HP Cloud Services for Airlines integrates Software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) to the airline industry. Applications for that include HP Passenger Service Solution, which integrates travel and transportation industry applications into a single airline booking and travel SaaS environment.
HP Helion Professional Services.
HP Professional Services consultants work with user organizations to help them create cloud environments. Businesses that engage with HP Professional Services are those that want to use hybrid cloud and other cloud configurations. These businesses receive advice on how they can implement cloud in a consistent manner and how to get value from their cloud investment. Businesses also receive advice on how to manage the cloud.

HP Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud.
HP Enterprise Services is a global division of Hewlett-Packard that provides business and technology services and is a subsidiary of the HP Enterprise Business unit. HP Enterprise Services are designed to assist businesses with services that include cloud computing, systems integration, network and systems operations, data center management, and applications development. A Virtual private cloud (VPC) consists of a collection of computing resources that are shared and allotted from within a public cloud installation’s Multitenant architecture. The VPC can be configured on demand and allows one VPC user to be isolated from other VPC users.
HP Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud is a managed cloud providing VPC features. It includes security features for businesses that connect to a public cloud through an on-site network, using Software-defined networking technology. There are five different sizes of VPC installations. Businesses can either manage the VPC themselves or pay a fee to have HP manage it. Multiple copies of a Virtual LAN (VLAN) are supplied with HP Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud. This provides a method for businesses to connect through the Firewall from their on-site network into the VPC, so that the VPC appears to be part of the on-site network.
Businesses that use HP Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud receive Encrypted backup on a daily basis, performed by HP. The service also performs automated load balancing across the virtual servers in the cloud. Data is stored off-site for the File systems and Server operating systems. User organizations choose to retain this data by HP for 30, 60, or 90 days. HP retains local backups of SQL Server or Oracle databases in the HP data center for 15 or 30 days; offsite backups can be retained for 15 to 90 days. User organizations choose 50GB, 100GB, or one-terabyte blocks of Storage area network (SAN) storage for server nodes, for which high-availability clustering can be added. Instances for Microsoft Windows Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server can be provided for HP Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud.
HP As-a-Service Solution for SAP HANA, a version of HP Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud, is a service for the SAP HANA in-memory database. Migration services are for businesses that want to move to the SAP HANA platform. The system is designed to enable businesses to analyze big data. According to published reports, organizations using HP Enterprise Cloud Services for Microsoft Dynamics CRM can use CRM software in a secure fashion and not pay up front for the infrastructure to run it.
Sample installations.
In November 2013, HP Enterprise Services opened in Barcelona the first of two planned data centers to host VPC in Spain. According to published reports, the data centers provide disaster recovery services and high availability. Acting as an investment partner in the project, the government of Catalonia has stated that it intends to use the HP Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud to reduce by 25 to 30 percent the costs of its Centre for Telecommunications and Information Technology.
The offshore drilling company Seadrill migrated its worldwide data center operations to HP Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud in July 2013. According to published reports, Seadrill chose the HP product over competing IBM and Capgemini products because it believed the HP Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud was less expensive and configured so that Seadrill could continue to run legacy applications in its own physical data center.
UNIT4 Business Software announced in February 2014 that it has contracted to use HP Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud as a secure method to deliver services to its education clients in the United Kingdom.
HP Public Cloud.
HP Public Cloud is a public cloud service from Hewlett-Packard (HP) that offers compute, storage, and platform services that are accessible via the public Internet to developers, independent software vendors (ISVs), SMBs, and enterprises of all sizes (including public sector).

The Profane Exhibit

The Profane Exhibit is an upcoming 2014 anthology horror film.
Production.
Producers David Bond and Manda Manuel shot the majority of the footage for The Profane Exhibit during 2013, giving a sneak preview of the film at the Housecore Horror Film Festival in October. Housecore, which is run by Philip H Anselmo and Corey Mitchell, was the first event at which several segments were shown in full.<br>
Bond and Manuel are currently in production on The Book, an Italian collaborative project which brings together a number of Giallo and Italian Horror directors.
Reception.
While the film's international premiere is set for the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival in 2014, a great deal of magazine and radio coverage has been generate in the run up to the release.
Bizarre Magazine ran extensive coverage of the feature, calling it 'The Biggest Cult Film Ever'
Diabolique Magazine published a nine page article in Issue #19 (Jan/Feb 2014) entitled The Gatekeepers. The feature, written by Colin McCracken, contained an exclusive interview with David Bond, in which the project was explained in full.
The article stated; ""With no jokey cameos, self-referential post modernism or internalised jibing taking place, it appears that a sense of thoughtful insight and craftsmanship has made a return to the genre.""
The leading genre website Zombiehamster.com ran an exclusive 'first look' review of the film on January 27, in which it was described as ""De Sade for the digital age"". The film was given a score of 85% and the overall reception was positive and enthusiastic.
The Giallo Ciao Ciao! Podcast, hosted by Creep Creepersin, featured an episode devoted to the two upcoming Harbinger International projects, The Profane Exhibit, and The Book.
The Profane Exhibit was covered on Homegrown Radio New Jersey on January 21, on the Horror Happens show.
Preston Carnell of Film Bizarro, after attending a screening of five the film's segments, gave a negative critique of the anthology, writing, "What was shown was far from impressive. What was shown was bland and dull, to be honest. Only Uwe Boll's and Nacho Vigalondo's contributions were interesting but even they were simplistic and lacked any sort of impact. They weren't a punch to the gut like they could have been."

Broadcast and reception.
The first episode of "Citizen Khan" was first broadcast on BBC One on 27 August 2012, in a late timeslot of 10:20pm. It received what Digital Spy referred to as an "impressive" 3.41 million viewers and 20.9% of the audience.
Critical reaction has been largely negative, with "The Independent"'s Arifa Akbar commenting negatively on its many clichéd jokes and character traits and drawing many comparisons with 1970s-style sitcoms. Mark Jones of "The Guardian" was more optimistic, describing it as "an affable enough debut, deserving a wider audience than this post-watershed slot is likely to attract". The BBC received over 700 complaints following the airing of the first episode with a further 20 complaints to Ofcom. Some British Muslims have claimed that the show "ridicules" and "insults" Islam. The BBC claimed it had evidence the complaints were part of a lobbying campaign and countered it saying a number of people, including those of Muslim communities, praised the show and referred to its audience figures as a "very positive start".
The Islam Channel made a special show titled "Politics and Media: Citizen Khan - racist stereotypes or harmless fun?" Presenter John Rees discussed whether the BBC comedy is stereotyping Muslims, or whether it is fun and can be laughed about by Muslims. Rees was joined by Ashgar Bukhari of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK, freelance journalist and religious commentator Hasnet Lais and Anjum Anwar, Chair of Women's Voices.
By the second episode, broadcast on 3 September, "Citizen Khan" clips had become viral. Opinion outside the United Kingdom has also been mixed, with many heated views that centred on its apparent cultural disposition. Pakistani newspaper "The News International" criticised the BBC's use of Pakistani flags in the Khan's home and Mr Khan's younger daughter quickly putting on a hijab and pretending to read the Qur'an. The Pakistan News Watch website countered "shows like Citizen Khan are essential in multicultural societies and help put all communities on an equal footing - if everyone can have a laugh at everyone else's expense, then no one can claim superiority". The debate continued into a third week with the "Yorkshire Post" publishing an article by Pakistani journalist Sabbiyah Pervez appealing to her own community to "stop being so defensive and learn to laugh at itself".
The BBC ordered a seven episode second series on 27 September 2012 due to good ratings. On 18 September 2013, the BBC announced that the second series would air on Friday nights in the prime time 9.30pm slot from 4 October.
The show, along with coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics, "Top Gear", "The Apprentice", "Doctor Who", "Sherlock", and "The Voice UK" made up the list of the most watched shows on the BBC iPlayer in 2012.
On 5 December 2012, it was announced that "Citizen Khan" would air in Australia and New Zealand on Seven Network in 2013. In July 2013, the show premiered in India on Viacom co-owned Comedy Central.
Episodes.
Thirteen episodes of "Citizen Khan" have been written and produced to date, and broadcast on BBC One.
Distribution.
Digital.
Series 1 is available to buy on iTunes in both Standard Definition and High Definition, Series 2 was also added a few days after its aired.

Thomas Oelsner

Thomas Oelsner (born 19 June 1970) is a retired German Paralympic Nordic skier who won multiple gold medals throughout his career. He was the first person to fail a drugs test at the Winter Paralympic Games and was stripped of two gold medals. After he served his ban he returned to competitive skiing and participated in the 2006 and 2010 Games.
Biography.
Oelsner was born on 19 June 1970 and is currently an advertising salesman. In 1991 he was injured in a motorcycle accident which left him with a paralysed left arm. He entered the 1994 Winter Paralympics in Lillehammer as a LW6 class competitor in the biathlon and cross country skiing. Oelsner's first games were a success, winning three golds, one solo silver, and one silver as part of the German relay team. Since then he has continued to use the same skis, even sleeping with them, as a matter of tradition. At the 1998 Games in Nagano he won two golds and one individual silver, and a silver with the German relay team.
Failed drugs test.
At the 2002 Winter Paralympics in Salt Lake City Oelsner won gold in the 7.5 km biathlon and the 5 km classic cross country. However, he would go on to become the first athlete to be sent home from a Winter Paralympic Games for failing a drug test when he tested positive for the steroid methenolone. He was suspended prior to the 10 km cross country event and subsequently stripped of the two gold medals. Oelsner protested his innocence, claiming that there had been a laboratory error or an act of sabotage involved.
Return to competition.
Oelsner completed a six month national ban and returned for the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino. He achieved a bronze in the 5 km cross country skiing.
At the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver Oelsner was embroiled in another controversy when he claimed that the sight on the gun he was using for the Biathlon had been sabotaged, smeared in something he thought might have been chocolate. He soon retracted the accusation and accepted responsibility, stating that whatever happened would have occurred when the gun was in his care. Oelsner announced his retirement from competitive skiing at the end of the 2010 Games.

<doc id="36844837" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36844837" title="Methamphetamine in the United States">
Methamphetamine in the United States

Methamphetamine in the United States is regulated under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. It is approved for extremely limited pharmacological use in the treatment of ADHD and exogenous obesity, but it is primarily abused as a recreational drug. In 2012, approximately 1.2 million Americans reported using methamphetamine in the past year; 440,000 reported using the drug in the past month.
Much of the methamphetamine consumed in the US is manufactured domestically by amateur chemists in meth labs from common household drugs and chemicals such as lye, lithium, and ammonia. Since the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, the Drug Enforcement Administration has reported a sharp decline in domestic meth lab seizures, but drug cartels continue to meet demand by manufacturing meth in Mexico and smuggling it across the border. In 2012, the DEA seized a total of 3,898 kg of methamphetamine and 11,210 meth labs.
Regulation.
In 1970, methamphetamine was regulated in the Controlled Substances Act, and a public education campaign was mounted against it.
In the 1980s, drug treatment counselors saw increased abuse of the drug among homosexuals. Mexican drug manufacturers began bringing methamphetamine north of the border, and forms of methamphetamine that could be smoked were introduced.
In 1983, laws were passed in the United States prohibiting possession of precursors and equipment for methamphetamine production. In 1986, the U.S. government passed the Federal Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act in an attempt to curb the growing use of designer drugs. Despite this, use of methamphetamine expanded from its initial base in California throughout the rural United States, especially through the Midwest and South. "Government officials in a majority of U.S. counties now report that meth is their counties’ most serious drug problem. Meth use is said to be particularly rampant in the American western states, where the substance is in high demand. States like Montana, South Dakota, Idaho, Colorado and Arizona have all launched extensive efforts – both private and public – to fight the meth menace."
Since 1989, five U.S. federal laws and dozens of state laws have been imposed in an attempt to curb the production of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine can be produced in home laboratories using pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, which, at the time, were the active ingredients in over-the-counter drugs such as Sudafed and Contac. Preventive legal strategies of the past 17 years have steadily increased restrictions to the distribution of pseudoephedrine/ephedrine-containing products. As a result "pharmaceutical companies and retailers such as Target, Walgreens, CVS, Kroger and Winn-Dixie have restricted sales of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Purchasers have been limited to buying small quantities and required to show I.D. to purchase them."
In the 1990s, new ways to synthesize methamphetamine appeared. Some new versions were reported to be four to six times stronger. Greatest use was seen in the Southwest and West United States, but methamphetamine use began and grew in the rural Midwest. Rural locations become ideal for cooking of methamphetamine because of geographic isolation and an available supply of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and anhydrous ammonia.
Attorney General Janet Reno was very outspoken in warning mayors, police chiefs and the Judicial and Executive branches of the Federal government and as a Florida States' Attorney about the dangers of meth (-amphetamines) as early as 1996 and before. She was reported by the Orlando Sentinel as commenting that illegal trafficking in methamphetamine, a dangerous and powerful stimulant, had been spreading rapidly across the United States. She appeared at the 68th session of the United States Conference of Mayors Winter Meeting in Washington, D.C. in 2000 with President Clinton and others to discuss social and law enforcement dangers of the drug nationally, especially in medium-sized and rural communities in order to deal with "the rapidly emerging issue of meth in America, discuss the unique needs of smaller and mid-sized communities to deal with the crisis, and develop prevention, treatment and interdiction strategies for meth which can then be applied to cities of all sizes as the methamphetamine crisis spreads across the nation."
As a result of the U.S. Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (CMEA), which was passed as an amendment to the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act, there are restrictions on the amount of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine one may purchase in a specified time period and further requirements that these products must be stored in order to prevent theft. "The CMEA requires record-keeping and identification of all sales and reports to law enforcement of any "suspicious" transactions. Purchasers are limited to "3.6 grams of pseudoephedrine base" per day and 9 grams per month. (Buying more than that is a federal misdemeanor.)" Increasingly strict restrictions have resulted in the reformulation of many over-the-counter drugs, and some, such as Actifed, have been discontinued entirely in the United States.
In 1996, Congress passed the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act, which regulates mail order and chemical companies selling precursor chemicals. For example, people purchasing large quantities of red phosphorus, iodine and hydrochloric gas were required to document that they intended them for legitimate purposes. Law enforcement agents were allowed to track large mail order purchases of pseudoephedrine, another precursor chemical. Chemical supply companies could be prosecuted for selling chemicals to people who make methamphetamine.
By 2000, in the Inland Northwest, and in much of the West United States, methamphetamine was the favored hard drug, surpassing crack and cocaine as the stimulant of choice, as it offered 3.5 times more potency, and a much longer half life. Heroin use was also being surpassed with methamphetamine, which unlike heroin, is not severely cut and reduced in potency with other additive substances. The crystalline form of methamphetamine contained at least 80 percent purity.
The Illinois Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act was passed into state law in 2005 and came into effect in 2006.
Use.
Legal.
Methamphetamine is FDA approved for the treatment of ADHD and exogenous obesity. It is dispensed in the USA under the trademark name "Desoxyn" and manufactured by Ovation Pharmaceuticals.
Illegal.
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is tasked with combating illegal meth production, distribution and use. The seized quantities of meth can give an idea about its changing popularity through the time.
The blue line represents the weight of meth seized (x100g).
The red line represents quantity of meth lab incidents.
Hazardous waste.
Meth lab waste is toxic and extremely hazardous, making cleanup a major problem for authorities and property owners. Common wastes include brake cleaner, ammonia, soda bottles, cat litter, lithium batteries, engine starter, matches and pseudoephedrine blister packs.
Operators of meth labs have been prosecuted for environmental crimes.

Adaptive coordinate descent

Adaptive coordinate descent is an extension of the coordinate descent algorithm to non-separable optimization. The adaptive coordinate descent approach gradually builds a transformation of the coordinate system such that the new coordinates are as decorrelated as possible with respect to the objective function. The adaptive coordinate descent was shown to be competitive to the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms and has the following invariance properties:
CMA-like Adaptive Encoding Update (b) mostly based on principal component analysis (a) is used to extend the coordinate descent method (c) to the optimization of non-separable problems (d).
The adaptation of an appropriate coordinate system allows adaptive coordinate descent to outperform coordinate descent on non-separable functions. The following figure illustrates the convergence of both algorithms on 2-dimensional Rosenbrock function up to a target function value formula_1, starting from the initial point formula_2.
The adaptive coordinate descent method reaches the target value after only 325 function evaluations (about 70 times faster than coordinate descent), that is comparable to gradient-based methods. The algorithm has linear time complexity if update coordinate system every D iterations, it is also suitable for large-scale (DÂ»100) non-linear optimization.
Relevant approaches.
First approaches to optimization using adaptive coordinate system were proposed already in the 1960s (see, e.g., Rosenbrock's method). PRincipal Axis (PRAXIS) algorithm, also referred to as Brent's algorithm, is an derivative-free algorithm which assumes quadratic form of the optimized function and repeatedly updates a set of conjugate search directions.
The algorithm, however, is not invariant to scaling of the objective function and may fail under its certain rank-preserving transformations (e.g., will lead to a non-quadratic shape of the objective function). A recent analysis of PRAXIS can be found in
For practical applications see, where an adaptive coordinate descent approach with step-size adaptation and local coordinate system rotation was proposed
for robot-manipulator path planning in 3D space with static polygonal obstacles.
