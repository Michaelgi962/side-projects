Hypertime

Hypertime is a fictional concept presented in the 1999 DC comic book series "The Kingdom", both a catch-all explanation for any continuity discrepancies in DC Universe stories and a variation or superset of the Multiverse that existed before "Crisis on Infinite Earths".
In comics.
The concept.
The Kingdom.
The basic premise of the idea was summed up by writer Mark Waid as, "It's all true." It presumes that all of the stories ever told about a character are equally valid stories. For example, despite overt contradictions between the versions of Superman (and his adventures, supporting characters, and setting) that appeared in:
No one of these versions supersedes any other as canon. This was a repudiation of the prevailing approach to continuity in superhero comics, in which only the currently-used version is considered valid, rendering prior stories which are inconsistent with this continuity officially apocryphal.
As it appears within comic stories themselves, Hypertime is a superdimensional construct which—under very limited circumstances (prescribed by editors in the real world, and by various in-story rules within the DC Universe itself)— can allow versions of characters from one continuity to interact with versions from another. For example, in "The Kingdom", a version of Superman extrapolated into the future briefly encounters the Siegel/Shuster version.
Hypertime works like this: the timeline and continuity background of any given story is like a river, with a nearly infinite number of distributaries—alternate timelines— branching off. Most of the time, these alternate timelines go off on their own and never intersect with the main timeline. On occasion, the branches return, feeding back into the main timeline - sometimes permanently, sometimes temporarily. Thus, history can sometimes change momentarily and then change back (or not). Because alternate timelines have been "splitting off" from the main flow for as long as it has existed, vast numbers of very different versions of any given character or situation can exist. If characters from a very different Hypertimeline move into another, this accelerates the process of change, causing more noticeable (but shorter) changes to the timeline (for example when the Titans were visited by their counterparts from "The Kingdom", Jesse Quick was briefly replaced by a version who had taken her mother's Liberty Belle identity).
Abandonment.
Hypertime has been infrequently used in DC titles subsequent to its introduction in "The Kingdom", perhaps as a result of its chief architects and proponents, writers Mark Waid and Grant Morrison, working elsewhere in the comics industry (notably for Marvel Comics). While the concept was used in two multi-part stories involving the Modern Age Superboy and Walter West the Dark Flash, many writers (such as "Titans" writer Jay Faerber) found that their attempts to use Hypertime were either outright rejected or their stories severely altered to allow no attempt to further expand upon the concept.
In July 2005, in promotional talks at the San Diego Comic-Con DC Executive Editor Dan DiDio effectively disavowed the concept of Hypertime, stating it would no longer be used in future DCU titles. 
The "Infinite Crisis" series resolved the continuity problem in a different way, according to DiDio, who in a Newsarama interview said "The great part about Crisis is that all mistakes and retcons are time anomalies." DiDio's solution, as seen in the pages of "Infinite Crisis", postulates reality-changing "continuity waves", generated by Superboy-Prime punching the walls of his extradimensional prison.
"52".
During the weekly series "52" (co-written by the concept's progenitors, Waid and Morrison, among others), Skeets/Mister Mind confronts Waverider, and refers to him as "the seer of Hypertime" and divergent timelines. Discussing the new 52-Earth Multiverse, Dan Didio stated that "each Earth has its own parallel dimensions, divergent timelines, microverses, etc". In fact, several divergent timelines have since branched off a single "Earth", with, at least on "New Earth", Booster Gold, Goldstar, Supernova and Rip Hunter acting as the new "Time Masters", whose role is to reset the different timelines restoring the continuum to a single chain of events. The villainous Time Trapper has since returned to plague the Legion of Super-Heroes, once again creating microverses and pocket dimensions to plague his enemies by muddling their past.
Booster Gold.
In issue #30 of the eponymous series, a single reference to Hypertime is made by a future version of Booster Gold to his son, Rip Hunter, giving an in-universe explanation for the departure of the concept. Rather than a retcon, the older Booster Gold explains that, to ensure the stability of the main timeline, he personally tasked himself with the role of "pruning out" divergent timelines from every single universe in the current DC Multiverse, setting the timeline to a fixed, cohesive state.

Chip Esten

Charles Esten Puskar III (born September 9, 1965), known professionally as Chip Esten, is an American comedian, actor and singer known for his appearances on the improvisation show "Whose Line Is It Anyway?".
Esten is known by his nickname "Chip" in improv comedy shows but is always credited as "Charles Esten".
Esten is currently playing Deacon Claybourne on ABC's "Nashville".
Career.
"Whose Line Is It Anyway?".
In 1992, the makers of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" asked him to audition for an episode, which he did successfully. Consequently, Esten made his debut on the Channel 4 show in the fourth series and "won" the episode. He subsequently appeared in more episodes later the same year when the show did a run in New York. At the time, the show needed a second specialist improvisational singer to fill in for Mike McShane.
Esten made his final appearance in the UK edition in 1994 before moving back to the US and playing the role of Luke in "Party of Five". Although appearing on stage and screen thereafter, it was his 1999 return to "Whose Line Is It Anyway?"--in the show's new-look American format, with Drew Carey as host--which established him with a mainstream American audience. He was a regular "fourth contestant" on the show.
Other comedy work.
Following his return to "Whose Line Is It Anyway", Esten made a guest appearance as himself with fellow regular cast members from the show Wayne Brady, Greg Proops and Brad Sherwood on "The Drew Carey Show". In 2003, he hosted a semi-scripted semi-improvised comedy mini series called "On the Spot". Between 2004 and 2006, he was a member of the touring group "Improv All-Stars" and recurring cast member on "Drew Carey's Green Screen Show". In 2011, he was a regular on "Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza" on GSN.
He, Proops and former colleagues Ryan Stiles and Jeff Davis regularly team up and tour around the country doing live improv under the name "Whose Live Anyway?".
Film appearances.
In 2001, Esten appeared in Billy Crystal's TV movie "61*" as Kevin Maris, the son of legendary New York Yankees slugger Roger Maris.
Esten had small roles in three Kevin Costner movies, "The Postman", "Thirteen Days" as downed U-2 pilot Major Rudolf Anderson, and "Swing Vote".
Esten also starred in a public service video, "Riding Straight", produced for the Motorcycle Safety Foundation's curriculum, "Motorcycle Rider Course: Riding and Street Skills" (MRC:RSS). Esten portrayed a surfer dude, a snuff-dipping hick, and a concerned friend in a bar.
Television.
Esten has appeared as a guest star in various TV series, including "The New Adventures of Old Christine", ', "ER", ', "Jessie", "The Mentalist", and "The Office".
He also appeared as a contestant on at least 4 (12/13 through 12/16/88) episodes of the game show "Sale of the Century", credited as Chip Puskar, having won about $34,000 in cash and prizes. An appearance on "Scrabble" followed in 1990 during its final week.
In 2014 he appeared as a celebrity contestant on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" and won $500,000 for his charity, which tied him with Rosie O'Donnell, Drew Carey, and Norm MacDonald for the most money won by a celebrity in one appearance on the show. 
He played Kelly's fiance' Lonnie on "Married... with Children" in the series' finale in 1997. He currently plays Deacon Claybourne on "Nashville".
Personal life.
Esten is married to Patty, whom he met in college. They reside in Sherman Oaks, California with their daughters Taylor and Addie and son Chase.

Serengeti cat

The Serengeti is a breed of domestic cat, first developed by crossing a Bengal (domestic and wild hybrid) and an Oriental Shorthair. Recognized and registered by The International Cat Association (TICA), no other first generation crosses can be registered as Serengeti. From the Bengal × Oriental cross came the first foundation Serengeti. Breeders then worked with the cat to produce a cat that resembles the breed profile set by TICA.
Created by Karen Sausman of Kingsmark Cattery in California in 1994, the breed is still in the development stages, but the ultimate aim is to produce a cat that looks similar to a serval, without using any recent wild cat blood. (Bengal cats originate from hybridization of leopard cats and domestic cats. Most Bengal cats used in Serengeti breeding programs are many generations removed from these origins and possess few genetic contributions of the wild forbear except alleles affecting coat color.)
Serengetis are spotted cats, with long legs and very large, round tipped ears. They have a long neck which blends with the base of the skull without tapering. Males are generally slightly larger and heavier than females and can weigh between 10 to 15 lbs; females generally weigh between 8 and 12 lbs. Because the Bengal stock is a hybrid cat, the Serengeti is also classified as a hybrid.
They are recognized by TICA in tabby, ebony silver, ebony smoke and solid black. A group of breeders in the UK are currently working towards getting TICA to also recognise the snow spotted (aka lynx-point) variety. 
The tabby is known as the brown-spotted in the UK. However spots can be black or dark brown on a tan, light beige or gold background. The silver has black spots on a silver background. Ghost spotting can sometimes be seen on the solid black version.

Asian Human Rights Commission

The Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) is an independent, non-governmental body, which seeks to promote greater awareness and realisation of human rights in the Asian region, and to mobilise Asian and international public opinion to obtain relief and redress for the victims of human rights violations. It was founded in 1986 by a prominent group of jurists and human rights activists in Asia and serves to promote civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural rights.
AHRC endeavours to achieve the following objectives stated in the Asian Charter "Many Asian states have guarantees of human rights in their constitutions, and many of them have ratified international instruments on human rights. However, there continues to be a wide gap between rights enshrined in these documents and the abject reality that denies people their rights. Asian states must take urgent action to implement the human rights of their citizens and residents."
Its sister organization, the Asian Legal Resource Centre (ALRC) holds General Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The AHRC and ALRC are both based in Hong Kong.
AHRC and Human Rights Issues in Asia.
On the eve of the International Day of the Disappeared, AHRC ranked the Philippines among the top eight countries in Asia where forced disappearances of activists are not just rampant but are carried out with impunity. Sri Lanka heads the list (statement posted on its website (www.ahrchk.net). The activists took part in the recent Human Rights School Session of the AHRC for 2007. The AHRC listed the other countries where forced disappearances take place with impunity: Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, Philippines and parts of India.
Further, AHRC had evidence to show that Myanmar junta uses broom-wielding gangs or Swan-ar Shin heavies not guns to crush dissent (fuel price protests).
On September 28, 2007, the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) criticized the Writ of Amparo and Habeas Data (Philippines) for being insufficient: "T"hough it responds to practical areas it is still necessary that further action must be taken in addition to this. The legislative bodies, House of Representatives and Senate, should also initiate its own actions promptly and without delay. They must enact laws which ensure protection of rights—laws against torture and enforced disappearance and laws to afford adequate legal remedies to victims"." AHRC objected since the writ failed to protect non-witnesses, even if they too face threats or risk to their lives.

Josie (Everything's Gonna Be Fine)

"Josie (Everything's Gonna Be Fine)" (often shortened to "Josie") is a song by American rock band Blink-182, released on November 17, 1998 as the fourth single from the group's second studio album, "Dude Ranch" (1997). "Josie" was primarily written by bassist Mark Hoppus about an idealized girlfriend, and the song includes references to the bands Unwritten Law and Dance Hall Crashers, bands the trio toured with between 1995 and 1996.
The single, which was remixed by Tom Lord-Alge, reached number 31 in Australia. The single remix of "Josie" was later featured on the band's "Greatest Hits". The music video for "Josie" stars Alyssa Milano as the object of Hoppus' affection in a high school setting. The original video was to depict the band performing on a sinking cruise liner, but the video was scrapped after filming.
Background.
"Josie" was named after the dog of Elyse Rogers, vocalist for Dance Hall Crashers, and the girl in the song is fictional. The line "Yeah my girlfriend, likes UL and DHC" is a reference to the bands Unwritten Law and Dance Hall Crashers. The line "She brings me Mexican Food from Sombrero just because" is a reference to the Sombrero Mexican Food restaurant located in San Diego.
Music video.
For the band's third music video, they attempted to take a more serious route and turned to director Jason Matzner and his collaborator Brendan Lambe. Hoppus' original idea was that the band would be playing on the deck of an old cruise liner as it sunk. The band would play in real time as everything around them exploded in slow motion. Gradually, the ship would reach catastrophe ("people running, sparks flying, superstructure collapsing") before the ship sinks into the dark waters as the songs ends with the line "everything's gonna be fine." As that video would have costed the band's label, MCA, millions of dollars, they settled on the alternative: the band is performing in a basement when one musician hits a pipe with his guitar, causing the room to flood. The video was shot in the backlot of Universal Studios and was director Matzner's first video. "Filming the first 'Josie' video was awful," Hoppus remembered in 2000. "We had to bring old equipment that we were willing to ruin." The trio were unhappy with the shockingly cold water, and DeLonge cut his head open on shrapnel that was floating around in water. When the band received the first edit, they decided to scrap it and start over.
The band returned to director Darren Doane, who also shot the videos for "M+M's" and "Dammit". The video stars Alyssa Milano as the girl of Hoppus' affection. "I felt really bad for her because she showed up on the set and it was just her and a bunch of perverted dudes who did nothing but stare at her breasts. They couldn't even help themselves," Hoppus recalled in 2001. The food fight scene was completed in one take by necessity, as the cafeteria was destroyed afterward. "All those kids had to sit around all day outside in the summer and, at the end of the day, they were rewarded by letting them nail us with tons of food," said Hoppus. Although "Josie" did not receive extensive MTV play, it was regardless viewed as an incredible success for the upstart band.
A clip of the original "Josie" video surfaced online in 2011.
Format and track listing.
The versions of "Josie" released for radio were remixed by Tom Lord-Alge; the Australian CD features the full version while the US CD contains the shorter radio edit. The live tracks on the Australian CD single were recorded at dates on Warped Tour 1997.

Albert Crocker

Albert Crocker (1882–1961) was an American inventor and the founder of Crocker Motorcycles. His innovations had a substantial influence on the motorcycle and racing business.
History.
College and racing years.
Crocker graduated from Armour Institute, part of Northwestern University, with an engineering degree. His first job out of college was with the Aurora Automatic Machine Company; he worked in the motorcycle division, engineering new products. Although he was an engineer, he loved motorcycles and racing, competing in and winning many endurance contests.
During his racing years, Crocker met Oscar Hedström and Charles Hendee, the president and chief engineer of Indian Motorcycle of Springfield, Massachusetts. A close friendship developed between Crocker, Hendee and Hedstrom that eventually evolved into a full-time position for Crocker at Indian.
Marriage and move to the West Coast.
Crocker's personal life was deeply affected by the 1911 accident in which the famous board track motorcycle racer Eddy Hasha was severely injured in a race and died from his injuries shortly after. Crocker later met Hasha's widow, Gertrude Jefford Hasha, in 1919, while both were working at the Indian branch in Denver, Colorado. They were married in 1924 and had one son also named Albert. 
In that same year, Crocker took over the Indian motorcycle dealership in Kansas City. The dealership functioned as a distributor for several Midwest states. Eventually, however Crocker moved to Los Angeles.
Crocker motorcycles.
In Los Angeles, Crocker bought Freed Indian, an established Indian Motorcycle dealership. 
Al Crocker and Paul Bigsby must have spent many of their spare hours designing and developing their own bikes, for in 1931, they introduced their dirt track racing bikes to the world of racing.
Crocker, a very capable designer and engineer, invented the Crocker 30-50 cu. in. single-cylinder speedway bike. It became the bike of choice for many of the best riders on the Pacific coast when speedway racing was at its height. Crocker ultimately built about thirty speedway bikes, giving the big-name speedway bikes some tough competition.
He later sold his Indian dealership and moved on to create Crocker Motorcycle Company in a small factory at 1346 Venice Blvd in downtown LA.
The Crocker Twin.
In the mid-1930s, Crocker and Bigsby began to work on a heavyweight, high-performance, overhead valve, v-twin motorcycle and in 1936 the first Crocker rolled out of the factory. Crocker knew there was a good market for high-speed touring bikes, but even he was surprised when he received more orders than he could possibly fill for his new 1936 Crocker "Small Tank" 61 cubic inch 1000 cc Hemi-Head model. The Crocker Twin was widely regarded as the fastest production motorcycle in the world. In 1939 Crocker introduced a new and improved model named the Crocker "Big Tank". However, as Crocker was producing during the height of the Depression, it became increasingly difficult for him to manufacture vehicles in small quantities, and in 1942 he abandoned production of motorcycles altogether.
Al Crockers son worked in the Crocker Motorcycle factory machining oil pumps and other parts on weekends and between School. 
In 1998 Al Crocker Jr. attended the induction of his late father into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame and accepted the medal on his behalf. Al Crocker Jr.now lives in northern California with his wife Mary Jane. They and their entire family attended both the 2006 and 2007 "Legend Of The Motorcycle" Concours d'Elegance at the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay California where the legendary brand his father created over seventy years ago was one of two featured marques. Today Al enjoys a close relationship with the team at the resurrected Crocker Motorcycle Company.
Many Crocker Twin motorcycles are still in existence and are among the most highly prized collectible motorcycles today. Crocker parts are still sought after and coveted. The most recent conservative estimate of the value of an original Crocker in restored condition hovers between $225,000 and $300,000 U.S.
The company.
The Crocker Motorcycle Company of today was resurrected in 1997 by Markus Karalash to produce the two original models, the Big Tank and Small Tank models that were manufactured by Al Crocker in his factory at 1346 Venice Blvd in Los Angeles.

Independent candidates, 1999 Manitoba provincial election

There were several independent candidates in the 1999 Manitoba provincial election, none of whom were elected. Information about these candidates may be found on this page.
Don Jessiman (Brandon East).
Jessiman was born in Wellwood, Manitoba, and has lived in Brandon for all of his adult life. He worked as a Western Regional Manager for the provincial government's Driver and Vehicle Licencing, and is now retired. He was a city councillor, having represented Brandon's Green Acres Ward (Ward 10) from 1995 until 2010 when he lost to Jan Chaboyer. Jessiman has also been a director for the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.
In 1998, he supported the construction of a new Maple Leaf Hog Plant in the area. In 1999, he participated in a federal task force on project funding in western Canada.
Jessiman was a member of the New Democratic Party when he was first elected in 1995. His participation in the 1999 provincial election was a surprise to most political observers. He filed his nomination papers minutes before the deadline, saying that none of the parties were sufficiently focused on seniors or housing for young people. He was 67 years old during the election.
Peter Juba (Point Douglas).
Juba ran for Mayor of Winnipeg in 1986 and finished third in a field of ten candidates, behind frontrunners William Norrie and Russell Doern. Juba's relatively strong showing may have been partly the result of voters confusing him with Stephen Juba, who served as Winnipeg's mayor from 1957 to 1977. Peter Juba supported lower property taxes and a wage reduction for senior government officials, and claimed not to know if he was related to Stephen Juba.
He received 360 votes (5.75%) in the 1999 election, finishing last in a field of four candidates. The winner was George Hickes of the New Democratic Party.
Juba later contested the Mynarski ward in the 2002 Winnipeg municipal elections, and placed third against Harry Lazarenko with 1,138 votes.

First Racing

First Racing (sometimes written as FIRST Racing) was an Italian motor racing team founded by Lamberto Leoni, which competed in International Formula 3000 from 1987 to 1991.
The team built a car for entry into the 1989 Formula One series, designed by Richard Divila, and powered by a Judd V8 engine. Italian Gabriele Tarquini was signed to drive the lone entry, giving it a run at the 1989 Attilio Bettega Memorial event in Bologna and the Formula One Indoor Trophy. However, the chassis itself was poorly built, and Divila disowned the design, claiming it was unsafe, even going as far as saying that the car was good for nothing but "an interesting flowerpot". The car then failed a mandatory FIA pre-season crash test, and FIRST withdrew before the opening Brazilian Grand Prix, folding thereafter when attempts to regroup and strengthen the chassis failed to come together.
The chassis would later turn up in as the Life L190.

In painting he is noteworthy as one of the first Qing dynasty painters to be influenced by the West. He is also was among the more significant portrait and miniature painters in the early Qing. He was skilled in painting people, landscapes, and buildings.
The Western influence in his art came from his exposure to the Jesuits at the Directorate of Astronomy. Their influence also exposed him to new ideas on astronomy and religion. At some point Jiao became a Roman Catholic and played a role on the Jesuit side of the Chinese Rites controversy.

Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi

Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi (literal meaning: 'This Life As It Is') is a sitcom that was popular on Indian television; it aired for the first time in 1984. It was written by comedy writer Sharad Joshi and directed by Kundan Shah, S. S. Oberoi and Raman Kumar.
It was one of the first sitcoms and one of the biggest hit shows on Indian television after the state-owned television, Doordarshan, started sponsoring its programs.
Overview.
Each episode as 20–25 minutes long and was aired on Fridays at 9:00pm IST. Its popularity can be gauged from the fact that video stores in London would await periodically for the copy of the serial’s tape. Even the box-office openings of cinemas were affected due to the airing of the show.
Storyline.
The episodes revolved around funny happenings in the lives of Ranjit Verma (played by actor Shafi Inamdar) and Renu Verma (played by actress Swaroop Sampat (Miss India 1979)), who play a married couple along with Renu's unmarried and unemployed younger brother Raja (Rakesh Bedi). Chachi's daughter who plays the character of Rashmi. Other characters were Ranjit's boss (Tiku Talsania), his Bengali neighbours (actors Vijay Kashyap and Sulabha Arya), etc.
A trademark of the "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi" were the characters played by Satish Shah. In each episode, Shah played a different character who played a key role in the plot. These characters would be from many professions and regions of India, with some being close family friends of the Vermas and others being total strangers. During the mid-1980s Satish was anointed as "King of Comedy" by the entertainment media as a direct consequence of the multitude of characters that he played on the show. In later episodes, Anjan Srivastav joined the show, playing different characters.
Second season.
After several highly successful shows, Shafi Inamdar (who played Ranjit) left. However, with the huge popularity of "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi", a repackaged second attempt was made with the underlying idea that Ranjit and Renu have moved abroad because of his work, while Raja is still staying with Ranjit's aunt, played by the legendary actress Farida Jalal, and a servant, played by Javed Khan. Raja's love life and affair with Nivedita was the new center of activity. The second innings had a reasonably long run but never reached the fame of the first. Ranjit and Renu return for the final episode.
The alumni of this show went on to have chequered careers in Indian and other cinema over the years.
Quotes.
Some quotes in the show were quite popular with teens:

Garokk

Garokk (also known as the Petrified Man) is a fictional character that appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in "Astonishing Tales" vol. 1 #2 (November 1970) and was created by Roy Thomas and Jack Kirby.
Fictional character biography.
Garokk was originally a sailor from Great Britain, whose ship the "H.M.S. Drake" crashed on the shores of Antarctica during the 15th century. The sailor was swept overboard and taken by a warm stream to the Savage Land. Wandering the Savage Land, the sailor entered the lands of the Sun People, who worshipped the Sun god Garokk. The sailor found a statue of Garokk with a cup beneath it. Thirsty, the sailor drank from the cup, but was chased off by the Sun People. The sailor escaped and managed to return to the Kingdom of England, but found that he had become immortal after drinking the potion. Over time, the sailor's body became a living, organic, stone-like substance until he looked identical to the statue of Garokk. Nearly five centuries after he had left, the sailor returned to the Savage Land and discovered that the Sun People believed that their god would return and their high priestess Zala waged war as a form of worship to him. The sailor, now known as the Petrified Man encountered Ka-Zar and related his story to Ka-Zar. The Petrified Man allied himself with Ka-Zar and journeyed with him to the Savage Land to prevent his worshippers from waging war there. The Petrified Man gained energy powers, and transformed into pure energy. The Petrified Man managed to stop Zala and her people by dissolving their weapons, and then returned to his physical form. However, the Petrified Man then went mad and believed himself to be Garokk himself. Garokk sought to destroy all life on Earth to bring about peace, and he and Ka-Zar fought each other. On Zala's instructions, Ka-Zar lured him inside an underground pool which turned Garokk human and mortal again. His age caught up with him rapidly and he died shortly afterwards. As he died of extreme old age, he recovered his sanity and then his corpse turned to ash.
Zala later captured an adventurer called Kirk Marston and magically resurrected Garokk in the body of Kirk Marston using the ashes of the deceased previous Petrified Man. Marston's body quickly transformed into a duplicate of Garokk's own. With Zaladane, Garokk attempted to unite the Savage Land tribes by forcing them to erect a colossal city for them. Garokk and Zala fought the X-Men and Ka-Zar; Garokk was defeated by Cyclops and fell down into the city's thermal shaft. The X-Men believed Garokk to be dead. The X-Men's enemy Magneto later found Garokk, who had transformed: he was larger and half his body had turned into crystal while the other half became like molten rock, and his intelligence was dulled. Magneto forced Garokk to serve as the guardian of his Antarctic base. In this role, he fought the X-Man Storm, but again fell in a deep pit.
Again Garokk survived and he returned to his normal size and appearance. When the Savage Land was destroyed by the alien Terminus, Terminus was defeated by the Avengers, his armor ruptured and Terminus himself left to die, but it turned out that this Terminus was just an impostor. Garokk found a suit of Terminus armor and under mental control (presumably by the real Terminus) entered it and started destroying the remainder of the Savage Land. The X-Men fought this "Terminus" and destroyed the armor to reveal Garokk. Garokk regained his free will and together with a machine made by the High Evolutionary, he restored the tropical environment to the Savage Land. This process infused Garokk's essence into the land, causing him to cease to exist as an individual entity.
Garokk returned years later as an enemy of Ka-Zar, but Ka-Zar defeated him
Garokk later appeared in the Savage Land, observing as the High Evolutionary took a number of newly mutated Zebra People children. He then led the Avengers to the High Evolutionary's hidden base.
Powers and abilities.
A human is transformed into a manifestation of Garokk by the mutagenic effects of liquid from the fiery underground pool in the Savage Land. Garokk's skin and much, perhaps all, of his body tissue are transformed into organic, stone-like substances, giving him gray skin that seems rock-like and "petrified" in appearance. He has superhuman stamina and his petrified body also makes him difficult to injure. Garokk has the ability to project tremendous amounts of heat, light, and concussive force from his eyes. He can tap into other energy sources to replenish his own powers. Garokk has the ability to create dimensional warps with the energy projected from his eyes, and is capable of transporting an entire city through one of these dimensional portals. He has the ability to change his size and transform into a being of pure energy, and then back into his stone-like physical form at will. Garokk can also manipulate matter on a sub-atomic scale; he could rearrange the very fabric of the Savage Land. He has a limited telepathic ability which allows him to learn of the activities of his worshippers through his dreams, though his mental connection to his followers.
Garokk is immortal; he does not age and even when his body is destroyed, he can be returned to life. Immersion in the pool which gave him his powers will cause Garokk to revert to human form. He can be magically forced by Zaladane to respond to her summons or else suffer intense pain.
Other versions.
2099: World of Tomorrow.
Garokk appears beneath the Savage Land during the 2099: World of Tomorrow series, which ended the Earth-928 imprint of Marvel 2099. Mlle. Strange, the new Sorceress Supreme, battles Garokk, who transfers his petrified form into her body, returning to flesh and blood and claiming the title of Sorceror Supreme. The series was cancelled and the plotline was not resolved.

Marvel Mangaverse

The Marvel Mangaverse is a series of comic books published by Marvel Comics from 2000 to 2002, with a sequel "New Mangaverse" released in late 2005 and early 2006.
The series depicts an alternate (or possibly two alternates, see below) Marvel universe, its characters drawn and portrayed in a Manga-like style. Three volumes were published for the series, two of which were connected by a continuing story arc with multiple Marvel characters, while the third and fourth series each started a new story and focused on a single character, which were Spider-Man Mangaverse and Jean Grey of an alternate version (apparently) of X-Men Mangaverse.
By 2005, Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005 has given the numerical designation of "Marvel Mangaverse" as Earth-2301. The majority of the artwork in the first volume was shared between different artists, each of whom delivered one issue, with book-ends by Ben Dunn, whose work is best known on the comic series Ninja High School. Dunn also did the entirety of the artwork for volume 2 of Mangaverse. The artwork for the five issue miniseries "New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate" was done by Tommy Ohtsuka.
Volume 1.
Plot: Three years prior to the story Dr. Banner discovered the Negative Zone, a dimension which contains vast amounts of energy, and was tricked by the terrorist organization HYDRA into building "the Energy Well", a means of harvesting this energy, to power their weapon of mass destruction. However, when the weapon was fired it created a massive EMP which caused a global blackout for twenty-four hours, killing thousands. During this time of crisis, Prince Namor of Atlantis led an invasion of the surface but was stopped by Iron Man, who disappeared soon after. Tony Stark rescued the now insane Dr. Banner and suppressed any memory of his involvement from his mind with a Cerebral Driver. Various forces conspire to create a second Energy Well, which leads to the emergence of Dormammu into Earth's dimension, who is defeated by the combined power of Thor and the willpower and strength of the heroes assembled to battle him. Serving Dormammu is a massive, Godzilla-esque incarnation of the Hulk- separate from Banner, who is destroyed by Thor quickly after Thor incarnates using Banner as a focus.
Tony Stark reappears during the first volume, reduced to a head, in an advisory role to the Mangaverse incarnation of the Avengers. Iron Man also appears in the form of a number of large robots that resemble famous Super Robot anime mechas, such as those from Mazinger Z and Neon Genesis Evangelion. These machines combine into a still larger mecha which bears strong resemblace to Mazinger Z which he calls Ultimate Ironman. This Mecha would reappear in Volume 2, destroyed in combat with T'Channa, sister of the Black Panther and the second Mangaverse character to be known as Dr. Doom.
Characters.
Iron Maiden - Antoinette "Toni" Stark a former S.H.I.E.L.D agent and the sister of Tony Stark. Also the current owner of Stark Industries. Unlike her brother, Toni has made her identity public and opened defense contracts with the U.S. military. She is referred to as "ironbitch" by the Wasp in the first issue of the series when she is nearly clipped by Stark as she returns from an unrevealed location/mission (this was changed when the book was printed for children to "ironpest"). Revealed in the final issue of the first volume to share a loving bond with Bruce Banner. Ascends to another plane of existence at the conclusion with Bruce. She also appears with a large mecha attachment to her suit which design is attributed to the RX-78GP03 Gundam Dendrobium from the anime "".
Bruce Banner - Currently reconstructing "the Energy Well" for Stark Industries. Gained the ability to summon gods after being exposed to gamma radiation when the well malfunctioned. Has a love for Toni Stark, which she returns. Ascends to another plane of existence at the conclusion alongside her
Wasp - Janet Van Dyne is an employee of Stark Industries and the creator of W.A.S.P. (Winged Amplification Surge Plasma) which allows her to fly. Differs from the original Wasp whose powers came from experimentation by Hank Pym, and also could change size via a serum.
Hank Pym - A boy genius/rock star, called to Stark Island to help Banner construct "the Energy Well". Can control ants with his guitar like Ant-Man did with his helmet, but like the Wasp is unable to change size.
Black Panther/Falcon - T'Challa came to Stark Island as a representative of the African nation of Wakanda, uses mystic arts to become the half human/half panther hero. He can also change his totemnic power and become this reality's Falcon. The Mangaverse version of Tigra found herself romantically attracted to him. In "New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate" Panther is implied to have been killed by the villains in the story.
Storm - Ororo Munroe was a member of a witch coven where she learned how to summon the elements of weather and now leads the X-Men. Villainous mutant Amanda Sefton was a friend of Ororo but tried to bring back the evil spirit Magnus. In "X-Men: Ronin" she is neither the group's leader nor a witch, but is once again a mutant and, as in the mainstream series, forms a very brief relationship with Forge, who dies at the hands of Jean Grey. In "New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate" Storm and all other mutants except Wolverine are said to be neutralized, which implies that they, like most of the other Mangaverse heroes, were killed.
Doctor Strange - The Mangaverse Doctor Strange is much younger than his mainstream counterpart, appearing to be roughly in his 20s. Regardless, he introduces himself as Dr. Stephen Strange, and it is hinted at that he is trained as an actual medical doctor like the Earth-616 Stephen Strange. He is the Master of the Mystic Arts, has a rivalry with Baron Mordo, continually researches new spells, and watches over the world. His assistant is Tigra. He is vaporized in the first pages of issue one of "New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate."
Tigra - Tigra works as Doctor Strange's assistant and "sidekick" of sorts. In this incarnation, she was cursed into her were-tiger form, and must accomplish 1000 good deeds for the curse to be broken. She had romantic feelings towards the Mangaverse Black Panther in volumes one and two of Mangaverse. In "New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate" she is encased in ice and dismembered almost immediately after Dr. Strange. Up until this point, Tigra and Dr. Strange were the only two characters outside of the X-Men, the Scarlet Witch, and Spider-Man to have survived through the entirety of the Mangaverse series.
The Incredible Hulk - not, as in other incarnations, an alternate form of Bruce Banner, the Mangaverse Hulk is merely summoned into existence by Banner. More than tall, and drawing heavily from Godzilla, this Hulk serves Dormammu.
Daimon Hellstrom and Johnny Blaze—The Ghost Riders, Sons of Satan. Two brothers that become monster-hunters and battle their evil sister Satana.
Omar Medina - Omar was a creation by Dr. Doom which primarily purpose was to assassinate and take the body of Doctor Strange back to the Alpha Labs where Dr. Doom could finally claim him.
Volume 2.
The second Mangaverse graphic novel continued storylines produced in the original series which was later collected as the first graphic novel. This series, at the start, brought back the Mangaverse version of the Fantastic Four, although slightly modified in appearance from the initial look they had in the mid-part of the first volume (though in the final issue they look as they do in volume 2). The story also introduced Mangaverse versions of Galactus (as a parasitic life form created by the Skrulls), The Watcher (who appears to be closest in characterization to his respective counterpart than any other Mangaverse character), a 13 year old Captain Marvel, gigantic versions of four heralds of Galactus, and the Inhumans. An armored individual resembling Doctor Doom made a cameo in these first few issues, who then became the primary villain for the remainder of the series. Revealed to be the sister of Black Panther, this version of Doom decimates the Avengers, and it is only through the combined efforts of the Fantastic Four, Doctor Strange, Tigra, and the Scarlet Witch (the lone surviving member of the Mangaverse Avengers) that the heroes are able to defeat this version of Doom and restore some resemblance of order after the mayhem caused by Doom.
The Scarlet Witch did not appear in the New Mangaverse storyline (perhaps slain as were 99% of the world's other heroes). Tigra and Doctor Strange appeared in the first few pages of the New Mangaverse comic to be brutally murdered by the Hand ninja.
Volume 2 is notable for borrowing plot elements and style from the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion.
Spider-Man Mangaverse.
The Mangaverse Spider-Man first appeared in the first series #24, where his origin was very different from the regular Marvel Spider-Man. In the Mangaverse Peter Parker is the last member of the Spider Clan of ninjas and has been taught martial arts by his sensei, Uncle Ben. After Ben's murder by Venom, an underling of the Kingpin, Peter starts to train in secret so he will be strong enough to exact his revenge. In this version of Spider-Man, Aunt May is Peter's mother's sister instead of Uncle Ben being his father's brother. The Mangaverse Spider-Man was brought back for his own mini-series, in which he encounters a cybernetic version of the Black Cat, as well as the Venom symbiote. This symbiote does not become Venom and has mystical origins and connections to an 'evil' clan of Ninja who are affiliated with Spiders, apparently a counterpart to Spider-Man's own ninja clan. Norman Osborn, better known as the Green Goblin, has a minor appearance in the series, apparently intended as the start of a second story arc that was never resolved due to the ending of the Mangaverse line after the "Ronin" mini-series.
In "New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate", references are made to both the death of Captain America and in the "Spider-Man: Legend of the Spider Clan" miniseries which introduced his black costume and the Mangaverse Black Cat. During the course of this series, Spider-Man develops the unexpected ability to shoot webbing, which surprises him entirely. He is also the object of affection for both the Black Cat (though she later turns out to have been in league with the Mangaverse Nick Fury, her true loyalty unknown), and Mary Jane Watson, who becomes the Mangaverse version of Spider-Woman, and is shown to be being trained by Peter in the ways of the Spider-Clan.
Unlike in the mainline Marvel Universe where Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Felicia Hardy are now adults, all three of them are in their early to mid-teens at this point, and possibly their mid-to-late teens by the time of New Mangaverse. This version of Spidey has wrapped gloves, a backpack emblazoned with the spider symbol, and tennis shoes.
X-Men Mangaverse.
The X-Men first appeared in the first series of one-shots which were later compiled into volume one of Marvel Mangaverse. Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Mirage and Jean Grey form the core of this group. Rogue doesn't appear to be an actual member of the group, though she does live with them. In this version of the X-Men, it is Wolverine, not Xavier, who has put the team together. He has one set of metal claws, most likely adamantium, on his right hand, and another set on his left composed of energy. He has white hair and a strange tattoo on his face, possibly meant to be the Greek symbol Omega. In this story, Wolverine and Cyclops are brothers. Wolverine cost Cyclops one of his eyes, while it is hinted that Cyclops cost Wolverine one of his hands. (This seems to be why one of Wolverine's sets of claws is energy while the other is metal. Throughout this story with the exception of a pair of panels, Wolverine was depicted with two flesh and blood hands, the flesh and blood appearance of both hands continued in the final issue of the first arc of Mangaverse). He is also hinted to have had a relationship with Jean Grey, who had begun to favor Cyclops. Several other characters (both good and evil in the mainstream universe) appear in this story, most of whom are forces for evil, including The Beast, Amanda Sefton, Mystique and Nightcrawler.
X-Men: Ronin.
This storyline centered around The X-Men and the Hellfire Club, who were battling on-and-off during the entirety of the story arc, due to the Hellfire Club's continued attempts to abduct Jean Grey and bring her into their group. During this storyline, Storm, who is not a witch in this storyline, but simply a mutant with power over the weather like the mainstream Marvel Universe, develops an attraction to Forge. The Phoenix Force, which was briefly glimpsed when Rogue tapped into it in the first volume of Mangaverse, has a much more important role here as Jean begins to either develop the Phoenix powers, or else is possessed by them. The X-Men's physical appearances are the same except Wolverine now has black hair, no tattoo on his face, and a mechanical right hand with energy claws (rather than the energy claws being on his left hand as in the first volume). Although not implicitly stated, it seems that the concept of Logan and Scott as brothers who each cost the other a part of his body connected to his offensive capabilities remains. Charles Xavier is depicted as the leader of the Hellfire Club, putting him into direct opposition to the X-Men. He has two daughters, Sage and Emma Frost. The Sentinels are Mecha, piloted by humans, (one of whom is Forge), who are killed in battle with both the X-Men and Hellfire Club, and are more or less obliterated by Jean Grey's newly developing Phoenix powers. The X-Men are advised by Toad, who is a very wise and Yoda-like person. As a former close friend Xavier, Toad is determined to destroy the Hellfire Club and bring Charles back to the X-Men.
The Punisher Mangaverse.
In this self-contained storyline (written by Peter David and pencilled and inked by Lea Hernandez), The Punisher is a woman named "Sosumi Brown" who is the principal of an unnamed private school. In the story (set in Tokyo), the Punisher fights against the Korean Skang Kee crime family, led by "Skang Kee Ho". The Skang Kee family uses an Oni (Japanese demon) named "Oni Yew" to try and stop her, but her sister ("Hashi Brown") finds out about her secret, and in the process obtains a cursed weapon which she uses to slay the Oni and save her sister. (In the story, it is explained they are orphans due to the death of their parents in "a tragic pogo stick accident".)
Unlike Frank Castle, Mangaverse Punisher does not use firearms, but martial art skills and a whip, which she uses to punish evildoers into submission. She also has a predisposition for bizarre forms of "punishment", including tickling a crime lord's feet with feathers, or spanking someone on the bottom. Because of this, she is referred to as "Tokyo's kinkiest superhero." Also, she uses a costume which makes her resemble a geisha, and wears facial makeup which gives the illusion of her face being a skull. Her base of operations is located within the school where she works; the entrance opens by moving a small skull inside her office.
The Punisher of Marvel Mangaverse was part of the stories collected into volume 1 of the Marvel Mangaverse graphic novels, and has not been seen since the first run of stories.
New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate.
"New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate" is the third sequel series to volumes one and two of Marvel Mangaverse, and starts some time after the events of Volume Two, "Legend of the Spider-Clan" and "X-Men: Ronin". Direct references are made to both "Legend of the Spider-Clan" and Mangaverse Volume Two.
The Hand make their first appearance in the Mangaverse. They are responsible for the deaths of roughly 99% of the superhuman population in the Mangaverse. They are also armed with the rings of Iron Man's long time nemesis The Mandarin. Elektra and Daredevil also make appearances; Elektra decapitates Daredevil and is herself cleaved in half by Carol Danvers in combat near the end of the series. Danvers then takes possession of a costume and shield which once belonged to Captain America, nearly identical to his costume from the mainstream universe (altered for a female body, making Danvers look similar to her niece Shannon, the MC2 heroine known as The American Dream). The shield, however, is identical entirely to the 616 version in appearance. Though whether or not it is made of the same composition, is completely unknown.)
Tony Stark returns, and once again becomes Iron Man. Together, the remaining heroes; Spider-Man, Spider-Woman, Black Cat, Wolverine, Iron Man, the Human Torch, and the new Captain America form a new group of Avengers and battle and defeat the Hand, along with a mind controlled Sharon Carter.
Several characters introduced in the previous volumes of the series were redesigned in appearance and/or personality for "New Mangaverse". The Black Cat, who was introduced in "Legend of the Spider-Clan", bears a striking facial resemblance to Rei Ayanami, a character from Evangelion in "New Mangaverse". Spider-Man, briefly unmasked near the end of the series, bears a resemblance to Shinji Ikari. Wolverine is redesigned in "New Mangaverse" as well, becoming taller, wearing gear resembling the armor worn by Vegeta of Dragon Ball Z, with a more muscular build, a facial structure intended to be based on that of Vegeta, and a redesign of his bionic hand and energy claws. The Human Torch, whose personality, rather than looks, have been based on that of Asuka Soryu of Evangelion since volume one of the series, underwent a radical change. Her hairstyle and facial structure as well as physique are altered. Her hair is now done in pigtails, somewhat more closely resembling the hairstyle of Asuka, rather than a combination of straight hair with ringlets. Her half sister Sioux Storm, originally pattered after Rei Ayanami in physical appearance (despite her hair being blonde rather than blue) as well as personality, changed in personality between volumes 1 and 2 of the Mangaverse collections, and by the time of "New Mangaverse" was much more emotional and sported longer hair, no longer bearing any resemblance whatsoever to Rei, and was slain shortly after her appearance in the second issue of "New Mangaverse".
At the end of the series, the Black Cat is revealed to have been working alongside Nick Fury, who is implied to have orchestrated the decimation of the super-powered population. Whether or not she is truly loyal to Fury, if indeed this is actually Fury, who is himself believed to be dead, has yet to be revealed.
New Mangaverse, though left open ended, appears to have been intended as the finale for the Marvel Mangaverse, as the near entirety of its superhuman population was decimated. It is therefore likely that the Black Cat's genuine loyalties will remain unknown due to New Mangaverse being the swan song for this particular universe.
In the Hulk: Broken Worlds anthology there's a short story, telling one of mangaverse's Hulk adventures in Norse Cosmological Zone, which happens before the first volume.

<doc id="2851097" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851097" title="Robert Irsay">
Robert Irsay

Robert Irsay (March 5, 1923 – January 14, 1997) was an American professional football team owner. He owned the National Football League's Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts franchise from 1972 until his death in 1997, and the former Los Angeles Rams briefly in 1972.
Early life and education.
Irsay was born on March 5, 1923 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Carl Irsay (born Carl Israel) and Elaine Nyitrai, Jewish immigrants from Hungary. In 1942 he joined the United States Marine Corps. In 1946 he was hired by his father's heating and ventilation business. In 1951 Irsay founded his own business, the Robert Irsay Co., and sold the business to Zurn Industries about a year before purchasing the Colts in 1972.
Career.
Irsay assumed ownership of the Baltimore Colts on July 13, 1972 after acquiring the Los Angeles Rams from the estate of Dan Reeves and swapping franchises with Carroll Rosenbloom, all made official on the same day. His last-minute US $19 million bid for the Rams was $2 million more than that of Hugh Culverhouse. Irsay's majority share in the Colts was initially 51%, with Willard Keland of Racine, Wisconsin owning the rest. He additionally announced the appointment of Joe Thomas as Baltimore's new general manager, succeeding Don Klosterman who accompanied Rosenbloom to Los Angeles.
In a controversial decision Irsay moved the Baltimore Colts to Indianapolis, Indiana, in the early morning hours of March 28, 1984, to become the Indianapolis Colts. Many fans of the Baltimore Colts continue to harbor resentment at Irsay, for perceived theft of the Colts and associated memorabilia, despite Baltimore gaining a new franchise, the Baltimore Ravens many years later. 
Move.
In January 1984 Irsay appeared before the Baltimore media and exclaimed, "This is my team!" He reiterated that, despite problems, the rumors that he was moving the team were untrue. With negotiations over improvements to Memorial Stadium at an impasse, one of the chambers of the Maryland state legislature passed a law on March 27, 1984, allowing the city of Baltimore to seize the Colts under eminent domain, which city and county officials had threatened to do. Irsay claimed the city promised him a new football stadium, something they later denied, citing the team's poor attendance. The next day, fearing a dawn raid on the team's Owings Mills headquarters, Irsay accepted a deal offered by the city of Indianapolis,
Indianapolis Mayor, William H. Hudnut III, contacted John Burnside Smith, then CEO of the Mayflower Transit Company, who arranged for fifteen trucks to pack the team's property hurriedly and transport it to Indianapolis in the early hours of the morning of March 29. An ecstatic crowd in Indianapolis greeted the arrival of its new NFL team, and the team received 143,000 season ticket requests in just two weeks.
Baltimore was without a National Football League team until 1996, when Art Modell moved the Cleveland Browns there. Initially they were to be named the Baltimore Browns. However, Modell was forced to change the name of his team. Cleveland was promised a new team by 1999 that inherited the Browns' name, colors, and history.
After Irsay's death in Indianapolis on January 14, 1997, the Colts were inherited by his son, Jim, who serves as CEO. Bill Polian handled the day-to-day operations of the team as vice-chairman until his dismissal after the 2011 season.
Personal life.
In 1946, Irsay married Harriet Pogorzelski, the daughter of Polish Catholic immigrants. They raised their children Catholic. They had three children - Thomas, Roberta and Jim. Roberta was killed in an automobile accident in 1971 on I-294 outside Chicago. Thomas, who lived with a severe mental disability, lived in a Florida facility until his death in 1999 at the age of 45. Jim is now the CEO and principal owner of the Colts. Irsay, who had divorced from Harriet, married Nancy Clifford on June 17, 1989, at Second Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis; Hudnut officiated the ceremony.
Irsay is one of the members of the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor, being inducted on September 23, 1996.
Health decline.
Irsay suffered a stroke in November 1995 and was in intensive care at St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital for several months. After his release he developed pneumonia, heart and kidney problems, for which he was transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He died in Indianapolis on January 14, 1997.

Subalpine Republic

The Subalpine Republic was a short-lived republic established in 1800 on the territory of Piedmont during its military rule by Napoleonic France.
Piedmont was the main part of the Kingdom of Sardinia which, despite its name, had its core on the mainland. The kingdom suffered a first French invasion in 1796, which led to the Treaty of Paris and the loss of Savoy and Nice. After a second invasion in 1798, King Charles Emmanuel IV escaped to Rome, but he never agreed to sign a new peace treaty, approving a final arrangement of its continental territories according to international law. After the great Battle of Marengo in 1800, Piedmont was still under military occupation when on 4 June 1802, Charles Emmanuel abdicated in favor of his brother Victor Emmanuel I, who was in Cagliari under British naval protection. Napoleon took this pretext to declare the forfeiture of the old sovereignty over Piedmont, which was annexed to France in September 1802 as the départements of Doire, Marengo, Pô (briefly named "Éridan", after Eridanos), Sesia, Stura, and Tanaro, whereas Novara went to Italy.
The Subalpine Republic leaned heavily on France: Paris introduced French style reforms and a coinage based on the French franc. The structure of government was a Provisional Executive.

The Red and Charline McCombs Field is the current home of the University of Texas Longhorn Women's Softball team.
Opening in 1998 at a cost of $4.5 million, the field seats approximately 1,250 and is named after university benefactor Red McCombs and his wife Charline. It features a clay infield and a grass outfield.
The field made local headlines on March 26, 2005, when, during a game between Texas and Kansas, a portion of the bench in the Texas dugout collapsed, injuring five Texas players, four of which suffered ankle sprains.

Clonal selection theory is a scientific theory in immunology that explains the functions of cells (lymphocytes) of the immune system in response to specific antigens invading the body. The concept was introduced by an Australian doctor Frank Macfarlane Burnet in 1957 in an attempt to explain the formation of a diversity of antibodies during initiation of the immune response. The theory has become a widely accepted model for how the immune system responds to infection and how certain types of B and T lymphocytes are selected for destruction of specific antigens.
The theory states that in a pre-existing group of lymphocytes (specifically B cells), a specific antigen only activates (i.e. selection) its counter-specific cell so that that particular cell is induced to multiply (producing its clones) for antibody production. In short the theory is an explanation of the mechanism for the generation of diversity of antibody specificity. The first experimental evidence came in 1958, when Gustav Nossal and Joshua Lederberg showed that one B cell always produces only one antibody. The idea turned out to be the foundation of molecular immunology, especially in adaptive immunity. 
Postulates.
The clonal selection theory can be summarised with the following four tenets:
Early work.
In 1900, Paul Ehrlich proposed the so called side chain theory of antibody production. According to it, certain cells exhibit on their surface different "side chains" (i.e. membrane-bound antibodies) able to react with different antigens. When an antigen comes, it binds to a matching side chain. Then the cell stops producing all other side chains and starts intensive synthesis and secretion of the antigen-binding side chain as a soluble antibody. This was a selection (though not clonal selection) theory far more accurate than the instructive theories that dominated immunology in the next decades.
In 1955, Danish immunologist Niels Jerne put forward a hypothesis that there is already a vast array of soluble antibodies in the serum prior to any infection. The entrance of an antigen into the body results in the selection of only one type of antibody to match it. This may happen by certain cells phagocytosing the immune complexes and somehow replicating the antibody structure to produce more of it.
Further work.
In 1957, David W. Talmage hypothesized that antigens bind to antibodies on the surface of antibody-producing cells and "only those cells are selected for multiplication whose synthesized product has affinity for the antigen". The key difference from Ehrlich's theory was that every cell was presumed to synthesize only one sort of antibody. After antigen binding the cell proliferates, forming a clone producing the same antibody.
Burnet's clonal selection theory.
Later in the same year, Australian immunologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet published a paper titled ‘A modification of Jerne's theory of antibody production using the concept of clonal selection’ in a rather obscure "Australian Journal of Science". In it Burnet expanded the ideas of Talmage and named it "clonal selection theory." He further formalised the theory in his 1959 book "The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity". He explained immunological memory as the cloning of two types of lymphocyte. One clone acts immediately to combat infection whilst the other is longer lasting, remaining in the immune system for a long time, which results in immunity to that antigen. According to Burnet's hypothesis among antibodies are molecules that can correspond probably with varying degrees of precision to all, or virtually all, the antigenic determinants that occur in biological material other than that characteristic of the body itself. Each type of pattern is a specific product of a clone of lymphocytes and it is the essence of the hypothesis that each cell automatically has available on its surface representative reactive sites equivalent to those of the globulin they produce. When an antigen enters the blood or tissue fluids it is assumed that it will attach to the surface of any lymphocyte carrying reactive sites which correspond to one of its antigenic determinants. Then the cell is activated and undergo proliferation to produce a variety of descendents. In this way, preferential proliferation will be initiated of all those clones whose reactive sites correspond to the antigenic determinants on the antigen used. The descendents will be capable of active liberation of soluble antibody and lymphocytes which can fulfil the same functions as the parental forms.
In 1958, Gustav Nossal and Joshua Lederberg showed that one B cell always produces only one antibody, which was the first evidence for clonal selection theory.
Theories supported by clonal selection.
Burnet and Peter Medawar worked together on understanding immunological tolerance, a phenomenon also explained by clonal selection. This is the organism’s ability to tolerate the introduction of cells without an immune response as long as this occurs early in the organism’s development. There are a vast number of lymphocytes occurring in the immune system ranging from cells which are tolerant of self tissue to cells which are not tolerant of self tissue. However, only cells that are tolerant to self tissue will survive the embryonic stage. If non-self tissue is introduced, the lymphocytes which develop will be the ones which included the non-self tissues as self tissue.
In 1959 Burnet proposed that under certain circumstances, tissues could be successfully transplanted into foreign recipients. This work has led to a much greater understanding of the immune system and also great advances in tissues transplantation. Burnet and Medawar shared the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1960.
In 1974 Niels Kaj Jerne proposed that the immune system functions as a network, that is regulated via interactions between the variable parts of lymphocytes and their secreted molecules. Immune network theory is firmly based on the concept of clonal selection. Jerne won the Nobel Prize for medicine or physiology in 1984, largely for his contributions to immune network theory.

<doc id="2851118" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851118" title="Shefa Province">
Shefa Province

Shefa is one of the six provinces of Vanuatu, located in the center of the country and including the islands of Epi and Efate and the Shepherd Islands.
The province's name is derived from the initial letters of SHepherd and EFAte.
It has a population of 78,723 people and an area of 1,455 km². Its capital is Port Vila, which is also the capital of the nation.
History.
In the 1860s, Havanna Harbour, north Efate, was the centre of development in Shefa, with cotton plantations the focus. With dwindling prices for cotton, agricultural administrators turned to maize and coffee, before settling mainly with coconuts and cattle which are the main agricultural products today.
The French and British continued to have conflicting interests in Vanuatu (then known as New Hebrides) and decided upon a Joint Naval Commission, or Condominium, in 1887, with the Joint Court opened in 1910, it is still used today.
Shefa Province was a strategic location during World War II for the mainly American troops. Major instalments were placed on northern Efate along Havanna Harbour including Tanaliou, Siviri and Saama, and some outer Efate Islands including Moso Island.
Geography.
The Shefa Islands are volcanic and limestone/raised reef in origin. The one active volcano in the Province, on Epi is only sporadically active, and other underwater and extinct volcanos are scattered throughout Shefa.
Shefa is made up of approximately 27 islands, Efate being the most populated and also the location of the Vanuatu capital, Port Vila. It is at the south end of the province and is surrounded by several smaller islands, including Iririki, Ifira, Eratap, Erakor, Erueti Lep, Eratoka (Hat), Lelepa, Moso, Nguna, Pele, Kakuhla, and Emao. To the north are the Shepherd Islands, a group that includes Naore, Etarik, Matasao, Makura, Emae, Buninga, Tongariki, Tongoa, Ewose, and Laika. At the north end is the other large island in the province, Epi, as well as nearby Tefala, Namuka and Lamen. Some of these islands are uninhabited.
There is plenty of reef accessible for snorkellers to the advanced diver including Pango Wall, and Mele Reef. There is even the opportunity to sight endangered species such as turtle and dugongs near Erakor Island and marine sanctuaries.
Some of the Shefa islands have no permanent watercourses and water must be collected for drinking and bathing from rain water, which can be a tenacious exercise during drier years. The rivers of Shefa include the Tagabe, the Epule, and the Rentapau River.
Marine sanctuaries are becoming an increasingly popular way to attempt to preserve marine life around Shefa, although traditional methods of conservation can be highly effective. This movement is also an attempt to increase tourism. Parks and Sanctuaries include the Efate Land Management Area. the Nikaura Marine Protected Area on Epi, the Nguna-Pele Marine Protected Area Network on Nguna and Pele, and the Hideaway Marine Sanctuary, Hideaway Island.
Demographics.
The capital of Vanuatu, Port Vila is home to approximately 44,000 people, mostly the indigenous ni-Vanuatu, and Shefa home to an estimated 79,000 in the 2009 census. Both anecdotal and statistical information shows an increase in urbanisation which doubled between 1967 and 1999. Most of Shefa's population resides in coastal areas and Efate’s interior is largely unoccupied.
Politics.
The Shefa Provincial Council Headquarters are located in Port Vila; these humble offices house the political and administrative hub of the Shefa government. The representatives for Shefa Province number some 18 and are elected every two years, with the President, Vice President, 2nd Vice President, 3rd Vice President and Treasurer being nominated at that time. The current President is John Markal representing Erakor constituent.
Culture.
There are approximately five languages, apart from the national language of Bislama, spoken over Shefa including the Ifira/Mele, South Efate, Nakanamanga of North Efate and outer Efate islands, Namakir of Tongoa and parts of Emae, and Emae language (a Polynesian outlier, in contrast to the other Melanesian languages). French and English are also spoken widely through the province.
Shefa Province is home to the Chief Roi Mata Domain located in Northwest Efate covering the area from Mangililui and Mangaas to Lelepa Island to Eretoka (Hat) Island. Chief Roi Mata Domain was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. It is the first such site to be inscribed in Vanuatu and is a popular attraction for tourists. The legend of Roi Mata speaks of a mighty Chief who brought peace to Efate and its surrounding islands after years of clan fighting and warfare. Jealous of his status, the Chief's brother shot him with a poison dart. Chief Roi Mata succumbed to the poison within Fels Cave on Lelepa island. He was then interred on Eretoka. Many still-living men and women were buried alongside him. This oral history was passed down over 400 years until a French archaeologist confirmed the tale by excavating the burial site and found some 40 skeletons adorned with jewellery denoting high rank. 
There are no "kastom" villages left in Shefa Province, that is, with people walking around in grass skirts and blowing conch shells on a daily basis; however, many traditional cultural practises are still strong in Shefa. Despite the inward-bound Western influence, people predominantly consume traditional foods, such as coconuts, bananas, and island cabbage, rather than packaged foods.
Economy.
Along with tourism and hospitality, subsistence agriculture and fishing are major economic activities. Hospitality venues include the many and increasing kava bars, or ‘nakamals’, that are dotted around Port Vila and greater Shefa Province. Substantial financial boosts into communities generally come from land sales which in turn insights land disputes and displacement from traditional lands reducing the possibility for subsistence agriculture by some of the communities closer to Vila.
Tourism.
Shefa Province is the gateway for many tourists into other parts of Vanuatu. Underwater wonderlands, endangered aquatic species, lush bush, active volcanos, living culture make up the diverse landscapes and experiences that await the tourist to Shefa Province. Specific tourist attractions include the Mele-Maat Cascades, the world's first underwater post office off the shore of Hideaway Island, the Vanuatu Cultural Centre, and tours to Chief Roi Mata's Domain. Port Vila is noted for its many high-quality restaurants and international cuisine.
As the main industry of Shefa Province tourism and hospitality is gaining a lot of interest from ni-Vanuatu as a potential business, and there are plenty of bungalows located throughout the Province. The accommodation ranges from the flashy and boutique to the quaint and provincial to the rustic and island style and everything in between.
The market for Shefa tourism is currently honeymooners, cruise shippers and couples with the main draw cards for tourists being proximity to quality tourism infrastructure in Port Vila, Vanuatu culture, World War II history, and marine activities. With the wide and readily available bungalow market opening up there is increasing potential for backpacker tourism within Shefa Province, Vanuatu and the entire South Pacific.
Transportation.
The roads are not regularly maintained or graded and the few sealed roads are located close to Port Vila. Funding from the Millennium Challenge Account Vanuatu has been used to seal the entire ring road and satellite roads of Efate.
There are 5 airports in Shefa Province. The largest is the Bauerfield International Airport of Port Vila, serviced by numerous international carriers including Air Vanuatu, Qantas, Air New Zealand, and Air Pacific. On Epi there are two regional airports, Lamen Bay Airport and Valesdir Airport. In the Shepherd Islands there are two more, Tongoa Airport and Siwo Airport on Emae. The regional airports are all serviced by Air Vanuatu.
Major wharfs are located in Port Vila, Efate and Lamen Bay, Epi Island, which are serviced by cargo and cruise ships.

Il Muto

Il Muto Ballet is a fictional opera by Albrizzio, within the musical "The Phantom of the Opera", just as "Hannibal" and "Don Juan Triumphant" are operas inside the show. "Il Muto" is Italian for "The Mute." It is featured in the scene in which the Phantom hangs Joseph Buquet.
Plot of "Il Muto Ballet".
"Il Muto Ballet" is supposedly based on and a humorous parody of Mozart's opera "The Marriage of Figaro".
In the "Phantom of the Opera" musical and in the film's plot (AKA Act I).
The scene which we see is set in a salon.
A wealthy Countess (played by Carlotta) is having an affair with a mute pageboy (servant) named Serafimo (played by Christine). To avoid her husband's wrath she makes Serafimo disguise as one of her maids while one of the maids assumes the role of Serafimo (played by Meg). However, her husband, Don Attillo (played by Piangi in the movie, played by a chorus member in the stage show due to Piangi being in the previous scene in a different costume), senses the deception; he pretends to leave the country, but instead conceals himself behind a screen in his wife's room. The Countess, believing her husband to be far away, removes Serafimo's disguise and kisses him (her since Christine is playing a male role), laughing about the apparent success of her deception. This aria, "Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh", with its musical simulation of laughter, shares some similarities with "Mein Herr Marquis" from Die Fledermaus. There is a momentary interruption when the Phantom tries to express his anger that the managers forgot to leave Box Five empty. After the interruption from the Phantom, Carlotta and the other characters on the stage then start singing the aria again. But while the Countess and the other characters sing it, Carlotta loses her voice (followed by the Phantom laughing and saying her singing will bring down the chandelier) and has to be taken off stage. However, the managers announce that they will let the performance continue in 10 minutes with Christine as the Countess, but in the mean time just sit back and watch the ballet performance from Act Three (the Phantom's voice has now gone away, and the flickering lights of the chandelier have returned to normal). The rest of the salon scene is not seen because of these interruptions.
Act III.
Although most of the plot of this act is unknown, it features a ballet entitled "Dance of the Country Nymphs". It is seen after Carlotta loses her voice. At the end of it, a backdrop lifts to reveal the corpse of Joseph Buquet hanging from the Punjab lasso. Buquet had spoken of the Phantom's disfigured face, and the Phantom had murdered him for it.

Thomas Tinker (Mayflower passenger)

Thomas Tinker (c.1581–1620/21). Thomas Tinker and his family, comprising his wife and son, came in 1620 as English Separatists from Holland on the historic voyage of the Pilgrim Ship "Mayflower". He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact but he and his family all perished in the winter of 1620/1621, described by Bradford as having died in “the first sickness.”
English origins.
The English ancestry of Thomas Tinker is not certain – author Charles Banks believed that the most promising connection to Thomas Tinker of the "Mayflower" is a Thomas Tinker in the same field of work – carpenter, of Neatishead, co. Norfolk, born in 1581 at Thurne, co. Norfolk. Author Caleb Johnson reports this same Thomas Tinker married Jane White on June 25, 1609 in Thurne, co, Norfolk.
In Leiden.
It is known that Thomas Tinker was an English Separatist residing in Leiden, Holland in the early 1600s. But the only time that his name appears in Leiden records is on January 6, 1617, when he became a citizen of that city. His profession was listed as wood sawyer. His guarantors, per the record of that event, were Abraham Gray and John Keble.
On the "Mayflower".
The Tinker family’s embarkation on the Mayflower, per William Bradford states: “Thomas Tinker, and his wife, and a sone.” The names of the wife and son are unknown.
The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship‘s timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.
On November 9/19, 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. Thomas Tinker was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact.
Family of Thomas Tinker.
Per Johnson, this may be the same Thomas Tinker, carpenter, who married Jane White in Thurne, co. Norfolk, England on June 25, 1609
Death of Thomas Tinker and his family.
The dates of death of Thomas Tinker, his wife and son are unknown. Bradford used the term “died in the first sickness” for the family so presumption is made they died possibly in December 1620 or January 1621 when illness had become rampant. Thomas Tinker was buried in Coles Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth, likely in an unmarked grave as with many passengers who died in the early days. His son is noted as being buried in Coles Hill Burial Ground and the wife’s burial is listed as unknown, but it is believed she also was buried at Coles Hill. The family is memorialized on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb on Coles Hill as “Thomas Tinker his wife and son.” 
The fate of the Thomas Tinker family as recollected by William Bradford in 1651:
“Thomas Tinker, and his wife and sone, all dyed in the first sicknes.”

Plains pocket mouse

The plains pocket mouse (Perognathus flavescens) is a heteromyid rodent of North America. It ranges from southwestern Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota to northern Texas east of the Rockies, and from northern Utah and Colorado to northern Chihuahua west of the Rockies. 
It has soft silky fur and grows to be 5 inches long, although nearly half of that is the tail. 
They often live directly underneath Spanish bayonet or prickly pear plants. They are accustomed to sandy soil and eat mostly seeds, large and small grasses and small leaves of plants. Some food found in their cheek pouches are: seeds of needle grass ("Stipa"), bind weed, sandbur grass, a small bean (probably "Astragulus"), and sedge ("Cyperus"). Even those caught in grain fields usually have their pouches filled with weed seeds. Seeds of two species of pigeon grass, a few other grasses, and wild buckwheat have been found in their burrows.
Their breeding season is mainly July to August and the females tend to have 4 embryos at a time. Other information about this animal is scarce.

<doc id="2851162" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851162" title="Sand War">
Sand War

The Sand War or Sands War occurred along the Algerian-Moroccan border in October 1963, and was a Moroccan attempt to claim the Tindouf and the Béchar areas that France had annexed to French Algeria a few decades earlier.
Background.
Three factors contributed to the outbreak of this conflict: the absence of a precise delineation of the border between Algeria and Morocco, the discovery of important mineral resources in the disputed area, and the Moroccan irredentism fueled by the Greater Morocco ideology of the Istiqlal Party and Allal al-Fassi.
Before French colonization of the region in the nineteenth century, part of south and west Algeria were under Moroccan influence and no border was defined. In the Treaty of Lalla Maghnia (March 18, 1845), which set the border between French Algeria and Morocco, it is stipulated that "a territory without water is uninhabitable and its boundaries are superfluous" the border is delineated over only 165 km. Beyond that there is only one border area, without limit, punctuated by tribal territories attached to Morocco or Algeria. 
In the 1890s, the French administration and military called for the annexation of the Touat, the Gourara and the Tidikelt, a complex that had been part of the Moroccan Empire for many centuries prior to the arrival of the French in Algeria. 
An armed conflict opposed French 19th Corps Oran and Algiers divisions to the Aït Khabbash, a fraction of the Aït Ounbgui "khams" of the Aït Atta confederation. The conflict ended by the annexation of the Touat-Gourara-Tidikelt complex by France in 1901.
After Morocco became a French protectorate in 1912, the French administration set borders between the two territories, but these tracks were often misidentified (Varnier line in 1912, Trinquet line in 1938), and varied from one map to another, since for the French administration these were not international borders and the area was virtually uninhabited. The discovery of large deposits of oil and minerals (iron, manganese) in the region led France to define more precisely the territories, and in 1952 the French decided to integrate Tindouf and Colomb-Bechar to the French departments of Algeria.
The last bloody years of the FLN's rebellion had been fought essentially to prevent France from splitting the Sahara regions from the emerging Algerian state, and thus neither Ben Bella nor the rest of the wartime FLN were inclined to give them up to Morocco when independence was achieved. The Algerians therefore did not recognize Morocco's historical or political claims of Greater Morocco that includes Bechar and Tindouf Province. Instead, they perceived the Moroccan demands as an attempt to infringe the country's hard-won independence and pressure it when it was at its weakest. Algeria was still reeling from the enormous damage caused by the Algerian War, and the government scarcely held control over its entire territory: significantly, a Berber anti-FLN rebellion under the leadership of Hocine Aït Ahmed had recently flared up in the Kabyle mountains. Tension escalated as neither side wanted to back down.
The war.
Skirmishes along the border eventually escalated into a full-blown confrontation, with intense fighting around the oasis towns of Tindouf and Figuig. The Algerian army, recently formed from the guerrilla ranks of the FLN's Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN) was still geared towards asymmetric warfare, and had little heavy equipment. They were still battle-ready and had tens of thousands of experienced veterans, and strengthening the armed forces had been a top priority for the military-dominated post-war government. On the other hand, while the modern, western-equipped Moroccan army (France was the bigger arms seller to Morocco at that time) was superior on the battlefield, it did not manage to penetrate into Algeria. The Algerians had counted on hit-and-run attacks as their main strategy, but the Moroccans managed to counter this approach. The Moroccans built fortified Sand Walls. These Sand Walls had land mines and electronic warning systems, as well as strong defenses placed by the Moroccan troops. The tactic was later used in the Western Sahara War. The war reached a stalemate and after the intervention of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Arab League, it was broken off after approximately three weeks. The OAU eventually managed to arrange a formal cease-fire on February 20, 1964. A peace agreement was then reached after Arab League mediation, and a demilitarized zone instituted but hostilities simmered.
Results.
The Sand War laid the foundations for a lasting and often intensely hostile rivalry between Morocco and Algeria, exacerbated by the differences in political outlook between the conservative Moroccan monarchy and the revolutionary, Arab nationalist Algerian military government. Final border demarcation in the Tindouf area was not reached until many years later, in a negotiation process stretching from 1969 to 1972, with Algeria offering Morocco shares in the iron ore earnings from Tindouf for recognition of its borders.
The governments of both Morocco and Algeria used the war to describe opposition movements as unpatriotic. The Moroccan UNFP and the Algerian-Berber FFS of Aït Ahmed both suffered as a result of this. In the case of UNFP, its leader, Mehdi Ben Barka, sided with Algeria, and was sentenced to death "in absentia" as a result. In Algeria, the armed rebellion of the FFS in Kabylie fizzled out, as commanders defected to join the national forces against Morocco.
Many have argued that the Sand War and its bitter legacy was a factor in the attitude of Algeria towards the conflict in Spanish Sahara in the 1970s. In 1975, Morocco took control of this territory, now known as Western Sahara, while Algeria began backing politically and militarily an independence-minded Sahrawi guerrilla organization, the Polisario Front.

Jazz hands

Jazz hands in performance dance is the extension of a performer's hands with palms toward the audience and fingers splayed. It is commonly associated with especially exuberant types of performance such as musicals, cheerleading, show choir, revue, and especially jazz dance shows. In cheerleading, the position with arms outstretched and fingers wiggling up and down is sometimes referred to as spirit fingers or jazz fingers. Depending on the performance venue, both gestures can be associated with campiness.
Probably the biggest proponent of jazz hands was the late Bob Fosse, who incorporated them in nearly all of his Broadway and film musical choreography. The best example of this is the opening musical number of "Pippin", "Magic to Do", in which still illuminated jazz hands are the first thing the audience sees.
Description.
In the basic jazz hands position, the hands are open, the palms face forward, and the fingers are splayed; in addition sometimes the hands are shaken and the fingers are moving. The arm is often straight. Gus Giordano describes the position as the "of [the hand facing forward with fingers stretched." Frank Hatchett instructs dancers to "spread fingers (jazz hands); face palms front." 
Neither Gus Giordano nor Frank Hatchett include shaking the hands in their description of jazz hands, but a choreographer may specify that the hands are to be shaken--the motion is rapid and fluttering, as if jingling a tambourine.

Holba

Pivovar Holba a.s. is a brewery situated in Hanušovice. Major owner is a brewer company PMS Přerov a.s. Annual production is over 350 000 hectoliters. The most notable product is Holba Šerák, medium strong beer, named after the nearby mountain. The motto of the brewery is "Pure Beer from Mountains".
History.
The brewery was founded by maltster Josef Müllshitzský in 1874. In 1906, the brewery became a part of joint-stock company named Nordmährische Brauerei und Malzfabriks Aktiengesselschaft im Mährisch Schönberg. The brewery was third largest Czechoslovak beer producer during interwar period. In 1948, the brewery was nationalized by communist regulation and became non-independent part of Severomoravské pivovary Přerov, the national enterprise. Producing of Holba Šerák brand was started in 1983. The Czechoslovak republic government launched economic transformation after Velvet revolution in 1990’s; a major goal was disposing of enormous nationalized property. Therefore the joint-stock company Holba a.s. was created, the PMS Přerov a.s. has become major owner in 1995. Recently, the brewery is well-going and gainful enterprise.
Marketing and PR.
Marketing.
A slogan is Ryzí pivo z hor, literally Pure beer from mountains. Company marketing is strongly connected with locality of the brewery which is situated close to High Ash Mountains. Posters almost always contain mountain motives. The product Holba Šerák is named after well known Šerák peak. The enterprise finances maintenance of hiking trails and is generous sponsor of sport events taking place in the mountains. The company also participates in art project Alois Nebel.
PR.
The brewery organizes two popular events. The Pivovarská čtvrtka is an undemanding sport event and The Pivovarské slavnosti is a music and beer festival taking place in brewery. Last year attendance of The pivovarská čtvrtka was 3238 persons and of The Pivovarské slavnosti was more over 7000 people. 
Products.
Classic, Šerák, Premium and occasionally special lager are sold in bottles, rest of the production is sold only in kegs and barrels.

Alameda High School

Alameda High School is a public coeducational high school serving grades 9-12. It is located in Alameda, California and is part of the Alameda Unified School District.
History.
It was at the Alameda Board of Education meeting held on March 6, 1874, that the suggestion to open a ‘Preparatory Department of a High School' was first presented. On April 17, 1874, C. Y. Johns was elected the first principal. Classes began with 52 students, in July 1874, in a rented room over a drugstore on Park Street known as "Boehmer's Hall". The building still exists today as the China House restaurant.
Boehmer's Hall was only temporary. Already a new building was being built on a site on Santa Clara at Chestnut, completed and occupied in 1875. The high school shared space with the Grammar Department in what became known as ‘Haight School', a site still occupied by this school today. The class of 1878, totalling nine students, was the first to graduate from Alameda High School.
It wasn't long before the number of students enrolled in the high school outgrew the space available at Haight. Temporary quarters were located at the Porter school, located on Alameda Avenue, by 1900. A campaign was started for a new separate high school building.
With the help of the high school student body, a bond was passed in the city for the new school. The cornerstone was laid in 1902 on the new site at Central and Walnut. The building was dedicated in 1903 and occupied in time for the December 1903 term.
Continued growth in enrollment required an even larger campus. In 1925 a new bond issue was voted on. The new school, dedicated in 1926, comprised three connected buildings, including the original 1903 structure which was refurbished to blend with the architectural style of the other two. The architecture, designed by local architect Carl Werner, is early-twentieth-century Neo-Classical Revival in nature, evoking images of ancient Greek temples with Ionic columns in front of the Kofman Auditorium, a facility known throughout the Bay Area as one of the best of the local playhouses.
By 1955, the ‘old building' had outlived its usefulness and was replaced with what became known as the ‘new building' by subsequent students until 1977.
Campaigns to replace old public buildings with newer earthquake-safe structures led to the construction of the newest high school building, across the street from the established campus, on Encinal at Walnut.
Original plans involved tearing down the 1926 buildings and replacing them with a sports complex, the only building to be kept being the ‘new building' of 1955. A dedicated group of alumni and citizens saved the venerable buildings and the planned new construction was scaled back to what exists today.
The newest building was first occupied in 1978 and included the site of the former Porter school. At present, the office of the Alameda Unified School District reside in the Kofman Buildings. The west wing now houses Language and Fine Arts, as well as the Frederick L. Chacon Little Theater. The school was made an Alameda Historical Monument in 1976 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.
Enrollment and Academics.
Alameda High School is an ethnically diverse school, reporting, for the 2011-2012 academic year, a composition that is 145% Asian, 13% non-Hispanic White, 10% Hispanic/Latino, 7% Filipino, 5% African-American, less than 1% American Indian/Native Alaskan, and less than 1% Mixed/Not Reporting.
The school has received National Blue Ribbon recognition and California Distinguished School and Digital High School awards. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, offering more than a dozen Advanced Placement courses. The school also has a very strong journalism course which produces the monthly student newspaper publication "The Oak Leaf."
Its Academic Performance Index index is 9/10, also the highest on the island, with a similar schools rank of 2/10. Alameda is also currently ranked #483 in the top 1200 high schools in the US.
In 2012, 88% of its students graduated, with 25% of those graduates attending college.
Athletics.
AHS competes in the Alameda/Contra Costa Athletic League (ACCAL) and is part of the Northern Coastal Section (NCS) of the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF).
Encinal High, Alameda High, and St. Joseph Notre Dame High School collectively field men's and women's Rugby union teams.

Benjamin F. Johnson

Benjamin Franklin Johnson (July 28, 1818 – November 18, 1905) was an early member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a brickmaker, merchant, tavern keeper, leatherworker, farmer, nurseryman, and beekeeper. Born to Ezekiel Johnson and Julia Hills at Pomfret, New York, he moved to Kirtland, Ohio in 1833. He married Melissa Bloomfield LeBaron on Christmas Day, December 25, 1841.
Johnson was baptized into the LDS church at Kirtland by Lyman E. Johnson in the spring of 1835. Heber C. Kimball ordained him an elder March 10, 1839 at Far West, Missouri and John Smith ordained him a high priest in 1843 at Ramus, Illinois. He served as a missionary for his new faith to the eastern United States and Upper Canada between 1840 and 1842. He was appointed to Joseph Smith’s Council of Fifty in 1843.
In 1838 he moved to Adam-ondi-Ahman, Missouri. He moved to Springfield, Illinois in 1839, Ramus (later Webster) in 1842, Nauvoo in 1845, and Bonaparte, Iowa Territory in 1846.

<doc id="2851214" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851214" title="Absolute dating">
Absolute dating

Absolute dating is the process of determining an approximate computed age in archaeology and geology. Some scientists prefer the terms "chronometric" or "calendar" dating, as use of the word "absolute" implies an unwarranted certainty and precision. Absolute dating provides a computed numerical age in contrast with relative dating which provides only an order of events.
In archeology, absolute dating is usually based on the physical or chemical properties of the materials of artifacts, buildings, or other items that have been modified by humans. Absolute dates do not necessarily tell us precisely when a particular cultural event happened, but when taken as part of the overall archaeological record they are invaluable in constructing a more specific sequence of events.
Radiometric techniques.
Radiometric dating is based on the known and constant rate of decay of radioactive isotopes into their radiogenic daughter isotopes. Particular isotopes are suitable for different applications as a function of the type of atoms present in the rock or mineral and its approximate age. For example, techniques with short half lives cannot be used to date materials that have ages on the order of billions of years, as the detectable amounts of the radioactive and isotopes will be too small to measure within the uncertainty of current instruments.
Radiocarbon dating.
One of the most widely used and well-known absolute dating techniques is carbon-14 (or radiocarbon) dating, which is used to date organic remains. This is a radiometric technique since it is based on radioactive decay. Cosmic radiation entering the earth’s atmosphere produces carbon-14, and plants take in carbon-14 as they fix carbon dioxide. Carbon-14 moves up the food chain as animals eat plants and as predators eat other animals. With death, the uptake of carbon-14 stops. It takes 5,730 years for half the carbon-14 to change to nitrogen; this is the half-life of carbon-14. After another 5,730 years only one-quarter of the original carbon-14 will remain. After yet another 5,730 years only one-eighth will be left. By measuring the carbon-14 in organic material, scientists can determine the date of death of the organic matter in an artifact or ecofact.
Limitations.
The relatively short half-life of carbon-14, 5730 years, makes the reliable only up to about 75,000 years. The technique often cannot pinpoint the date of an archeological site better than historic records, but is highly effective for precise dates when calibrated with other dating techniques such as tree-ring dating.
An additional problem with carbon-14 dates from archeological sites is known as the "old wood" problem. It is possible, particularly in dry, desert climates, for organic materials such as from dead trees to remain in their natural state for hundreds of years before people use them as firewood or building materials, after which they become part of the archaeological record. Thus dating that particular tree does not necessarily indicate when the fire burned or the structure was built. For this reason, many archaeologists prefer to use samples from short-lived plants for radiocarbon dating. The development of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating, which allows a date to be obtained from a very small sample, has been very useful in this regard.
Potassium-argon dating.
Other radiometric dating techniques are available for earlier periods. One of the most widely used is potassium-argon dating (K-Ar dating). Potassium-40 is a radioactive isotope of potassium that decays into argon-40. The half-life of potassium-40 is 1.3 billion years, far longer than that of carbon-14, allowing much older samples to be dated. Potassium is common in rocks and minerals, allowing many samples of geochronological or archeological interest to be dated. Argon, a noble gas, is not commonly incorporated into such samples except when produced "in situ" through radioactive decay. The date measured reveals the last time that the object was heated past the closure temperature at which the trapped argon can escape the lattice. K-Ar dating was used to calibrate the geomagnetic polarity time scale.
Luminescence dating.
Thermoluminescence.
Thermoluminescence testing also dates items to the last time they were heated. This technique is based on the principle that all objects absorb radiation from the environment. This process frees electrons within minerals that remain caught within the item. Heating an item to 500 degrees Celsius or higher releases the trapped electrons, producing light. This light can be measured to determine the last time the item was heated.
Limitations.
Radiation levels do not remain constant over time. Fluctuating levels can skew results – for example, if an item went through several high radiation eras, thermoluminescence will return an older date for the item. Many factors can spoil the sample before testing as well, exposing the sample to heat or direct light may cause some of the electrons to dissipate, causing the item to date younger.
Because of these and other factors, Thermoluminescence is at the most about 15% accurate. It cannot be used to accurately date a site on its own. However, it can be used to confirm the antiquity of an item.
Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL).
Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating constrains the time at which sediment was last exposed to light. During sediment transport, exposure to sunlight 'zeros' the luminescence signal. Upon burial, the sediment accumulates a luminescence signal as natural ambient radiation gradually ionises the mineral grains. Careful sampling under dark conditions allows the sediment to be exposed to artificial light in the laboratory which releases the OSL signal. The amount of luminescence released is used to calculate the equivalent dose (De) that the sediment has acquired since deposition, which can be used in combination with the dose rate (Dr) to calculate the age.
Dendrochronology.
Dendrochronology or tree-ring dating is the scientific method of dating based on the analysis of patterns of tree rings, also known as growth rings. Dendrochronology can date the time at which tree rings were formed, in many types of wood, to the exact calendar year. This has three main areas of application: paleoecology, where it is used to determine certain aspects of past ecologies (most prominently climate); archaeology, where it is used to date old buildings, etc.; and radiocarbon dating, where it is used to calibrate radiocarbon ages (see below).
In some areas of the world, it is possible to date wood back a few thousand years, or even many thousands. Currently, the maximum for fully anchored chronologies is a little over 11,000 years from present.
Amino acid dating.
Amino acid dating is a dating technique used to estimate the age of a specimen in paleobiology, archaeology, forensic science, taphonomy, sedimentary geology and other fields. This technique relates changes in amino acid molecules to the time elapsed since they were formed. All biological tissues contain amino acids. All amino acids except glycine (the simplest one) are optically active, having an asymmetric carbon atom. This means that the amino acid can have two different configurations, "D" or "L" which are mirror images of each other. With a few important exceptions, living organisms keep all their amino acids in the "L" configuration. When an organism dies, control over the configuration of the amino acids ceases, and the ratio of D to L moves from a value near 0 towards an equilibrium value near 1, a process called racemization. Thus, measuring the ratio of D to L in a sample enables one to estimate how long ago the specimen died.

Ha (Talvin Singh album)

Ha is the second release by the tabla artist and music producer Talvin Singh. With yet another near-universally understood title, the album mellows down the crossbred musical concepts of his previous album and draws more inspiration from the Indian sub-continent. The album is much more subtly detailed, experimenting with irregular time-patterns and two-steps beat patterns.
The album had a mixed reception when released, and was broadly seen as a step back from its broad-stroked transglobal predecessor, which won him the Mercury Music Prize in 1999.

Innu language

Innu-aimun or Montagnais is an Algonquian language spoken by over 8,000 people, called the Innu, in Labrador and Quebec in Eastern Canada. It is a member of the Cree–Montagnais–Naskapi dialect continuum and is spoken in various dialects depending on the community.
Literature.
In recent years, Innu-aimun has had considerable exposure in the popular culture of Canada and France due to the success of the rock music band Kashtin and the later solo careers of its founders Claude McKenzie and Florent Vollant. Widely heard hit songs with Innu-language lyrics have included "Ish-kuess" (""Girl""), "E Uassiuian" (""My Childhood""), "Tipatshimun" (""Song of the devil"") and in particular "Akua tuta" (""Take care of yourself""), which appeared on soundtrack compilations for the popular television series "Due South" and the documentary "Music for The Native Americans". The lyrics of Akua Tuta are featured on over 50 websites, making this one of the most broadly accessible pieces of text written in any native North American language. Florent Vollant has also rendered several well-known Christmas carols into Innu in his 1999 album "Nipaiamianan".
In 2013, "a comprehensive pan-Innu dictionary, covering all the Innu dialects spoken in Quebec and Labrador published in Innu, English and French."
Phonology.
Innu-aimun has the following phonemes (written using the standard orthography, with equivalents in brackets):
L is written as n in standard orthography. 
The voiceless stops are voiced to between vowels.
Grammar.
Innu-aimun is a polysynthetic, head-marking language with relatively free word order. Its three basic parts of speech are nouns, verbs, and particles. Nouns are grouped into two genders, animate and inanimate, and may carry affixes indicating plurality, possession, obviation, and location. Verbs are divided into four classes based on their transitivity: animate intransitive (AI), inanimate intransitive (II), transitive inanimate (TI), and transitive animate (TA). Verbs may carry affixes indicating agreement (with both subject and object arguments), tense, mood, and inversion. Two different sets, or "orders", of verbal affixes are used depending on the verb's syntactic context. In simple main clauses, the verb is marked using affixes of the "independent order", whereas in subordinate clauses and content-word questions, affixes of the "conjunct order" are used.
Dialects.
Innu-aimun is related to East Cree ("Īyiyū Ayimūn" - Northern/Coastal dialect and "Īnū Ayimūn" - Southern/Inland dialect) spoken by the James Bay Cree of the James Bay region of Quebec and Ontario and the Atikamekw ("Nēhinawēwin" and "Nehirâmowin") of the Atikamekw (‘Nehiraw’, ‘Nehirowisiw’). Innu-aimun is divided into four dialects - Southern Montagnais (Mashteuiatsh and Betsiamites), Eastern Montagnais (Mingan, Natashquan, La Romaine, Pakuashipi), Central Montagnais (Sept-Iles and Maliotenam, Matimekosh) and Labrador -Montagnais (Sheshatshit). The speakers of the different dialects can communicate well with each other. The Naskapi language and culture are quite different from those of the Montagnais, in which the dialect changes from y to n as in "Iiyuu" versus "Innu".

Mystery Disc is a compilation album by Frank Zappa. It was released on CD in 1998, compiling tracks that were originally released on two separate vinyl records and included in the mail order "Old Masters" box sets, which were released in three volumes between 1985 and 1987. (These box sets, issued on Barking Pumpkin, contained repressings of Zappa's albums from "Freak Out!" (1966) to "Zoot Allures" (1976), along with a 'Mystery Disc' in boxes one and two.) The CD omits the last two tracks from the 1985 LP, "Why Don'tcha Do Me Right?" and "Big Leg Emma", both of which were included on the CD version of "Absolutely Free" (1967) in 1989.
The recordings featured on "Mystery Disc" cover the early stages of Zappa's career, and were made between 1962 and 1969 (with the exception of "The Story of Willie the Pimp", a 1972 'field recording'). The material overlaps in places with that of "You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 5" (1992), "Ahead of Their Time" (1993) and "The Lost Episodes" (1996). A number of the earlier tracks—"I Was a Teen-Age Malt Shop", "The Birth of Captain Beefheart" and "Metal Man Has Won His Wings", all likely recorded in 1964—feature Captain Beefheart on vocals. These are three light-hearted collaborations; "Metal Man Has Won His Wings" has Beefheart reading the lyrics directly from an advert for a comic book.

School Daze

School Daze is a 1988 American musical-drama film, written and directed by Spike Lee, and starring Larry Fishburne, Giancarlo Esposito, and Tisha Campbell-Martin. Based in part on Spike Lee's experiences at Atlanta's Morehouse College, Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University, it is a story about fraternity and sorority members clashing with other students at a historically black college during homecoming weekend. It also touches upon issues of real and perceived racism related to skin tone bias and hair texture within the African-American community. The second feature film by Spike Lee, "School Daze" was released on February 12, 1988 by Columbia Pictures.
Synopsis.
Vaughn "Dap" Dunlap (Fishburne) is a politically conscious black American student at Mission College, a leading historically black college whose motto is "Uplift the Race". The college administration is portrayed as inept.
He leads anti-apartheid demonstrations encouraging students and school administrators to divest from South Africa. When his buddies go into town, they find the local boys are not impressed with their activities, but think of them as privileged college boys. Open conflict breaks out between the groups.
He is feuding with Julian Eaves (Esposito) aka Dean Big Brother Almighty of Gamma Phi Gamma Fraternity, Incorporated. This group is characterized as "wannabees", as in "wannabe better than me". The fraternity brothers are preparing for a big college football weekend and Homecoming parties. Meanwhile, Dap's younger cousin, Darrell (Lee), aka "Half-Pint", is a Gamma pledge.
The Gamma women's auxiliary, the Gamma Rays, who are sleek and light-skinned, confront non-Greek black co-eds, particularly over skin color and the nature of their hair. Some of the Rays use contact lens to change eye color.
Cast.
Vanessa L. Williams was originally considered for the role of Jane Toussaint, and Phyllis Yvonne Stickney for the role of Rachel Meadows. However, due to her recent dethroning from her Miss America title because of controversy over nude photos published in "Penthouse", Williams turned down the role. She cited a sex scene between Jane and Julian (Dean Big Brother Almighty) (which became well known) and said she wanted to distance herself from that image.
Spike Lee was so impressed by Tisha Campbell's singing performance in "Little Shop of Horrors" (1986) that he cast her for the part of Jane. Stickney left the production over "artistic differences."
Reception.
The film received positive reviews for its exploration of issues within the black community. Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" noted, "There is no doubt in my mind that "School Daze," in its own way, is one of the most honest and revealing movies I've ever seen about modern middle-class black life in America." He also noted its frank exploration of issues of discrimination within the black community related to skin tone and nature of hair. He said it was significant as a film with a "completely black orientation. All of the characters, good and bad, are black, and all of the character's references are to each other."
Some people resented Lee's portrayal of a dysfunctional black college. Many officials of black colleges and faculty heads attacked the film for its use of racial language, epithets and portrayal of a college in trouble. They objected to "frizzie" and "nappy-headed" as among the words used by the students for each other, referring to their hair. As a result of the film, some colleges excluded Lee from their lecture programs.
Production.
Spike Lee arranged for the two groups of actors to stay in separate hotels during filming. The actors playing the "wannabees" were given better accommodations than the ones playing the "jigaboos". This favoritism contributed to tension on the set, which showed in the on-camera animosity between the two camps. (The producers used a similar tactic in filming "Animal House," with similar results.) In "School Daze", the method approach yielded strong results — the fight that occurs at the step show between Dap's crew and the Gammas was not in the script. On the day the scene was shot, the fight broke out between the two sides. Lee ordered the cameras to keep rolling.
Officials of Morehouse, Spelman, and Clark Atlanta University asked Lee to stop filming on the campuses before he completed his work because the colleges' Boards of Directors had concerns on how he was portraying the historically black colleges in the film. Lee had to finish filming at the neighboring Morris Brown College.
Though "Mission College," and "Gamma Phi Gamma" were fictional, chapter members of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, the oldest of black fraternities, appear in "School Daze".
Influences.
Actors in the film were picked for other parts: Three members of the "School Daze" cast -- Kadeem Hardison, Darryl M. Bell, and Jasmine Guy—became principal cast members on "The Cosby Show" spin-off "A Different World", a TV series about life at a historically black college. Other "School Daze" cast members also appeared on "A Different World", including Dominic Hoffman, Tisha Campbell, Art Evans, Guy Killum and Roger Guenveur Smith.
Alva Rogers, a cast member of "School Daze", starred in "Daughters of the Dust" (1992), the first feature film directed by a black American woman that was distributed theatrically in the United States.
In 2009, the singer Alicia Keys paid homage to "School Daze" in the music video for her song "Teenage Love Affair". (She imitated scenes including the rally in front of the school building, the pajama party, and the scene where Tisha Campbell and her court perform at coronation.)
Soundtrack.
"Da Butt," written by Marcus Miller and Mark Stevens, and performed by the group E.U. (who appear in the film), hit number 1 on Billboard's R&B chart and number 35 on its Pop chart. The "School Daze" soundtrack also features the song, "Be One," written by Bill Lee and performed by Phyllis Hyman, who also appears in the film.

Thomas Vaughan (died 1483)

Sir Thomas Vaughan (c. 1410 – June 1483) was a Welsh statesman and diplomat, who rose to prominence before and during the Wars of the Roses. He began as an adherent of Jasper Tudor and King Henry VI of England, and was appointed to several offices by Henry. He was nonetheless a Yorkist by inclination, as were many Welshmen of the time. After the Yorkist victory in 1461 he became a loyal and important servant of King Edward IV. In 1483, he was executed by Richard III as part of his seizure of the throne.
Life.
Vaughan was the son of Robert and Margaret Vaughan of Monmouth. In 1446 he was appointed to the offices of Steward, Receiver, and Master of the Game in Herefordshire and Ewyas, and Steward, Constable, Porter, and Receiver of Abergavenny. In 1450, he became Master of the Ordnance. He entered Parliament in 1455 as MP for Marlborough.
Despite his early association with Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke, Vaughan was accused of plotting against King Henry VI of England as early as 1459. Somehow he regained the king's favour, and in 1460 was appointed Keeper of Henry VI's "great Wardrobe".
After Henry's defeat at Saint Albans in 1461, Vaughan, along with Philip Malpas and William Hatclyf, sailed for Ireland with Henry's treasury, but were captured by French pirates. Edward IV, surprisingly, ransomed Vaughan from the pirates, for which Vaughan was forever afterwards loyal. Edward soon came to trust Vaughan and placed him in high offices.
Vaughan was appointed Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex for 1464. In 1465 Edward made him Treasurer of the King's Chamber and Master of the King's Jewels.
Edward also sent Vaughan as ambassador to the courts of Burgundy and France. He helped negotiate the marriage of Edward's sister, Margaret to the Duke of Burgundy in 1468.
In 1475, on the same day that Edward's eldest son, the future Edward V, was invested as Prince of Wales, Vaughan was knighted, having acted for some years as Chamberlain to the young prince.
In 1478, he was elected to parliament as knight of the shire for Cornwall.
After Edward IV died in 1483, Vaughan was accompanying Edward V from Ludlow to London when the party was intercepted by the future King Richard III, then Duke of Gloucester. Richard had Vaughan arrested and executed. The execution is believed to have taken place some time between 13 and 25 June at Pontefract Castle in West Yorkshire.
Vaughan was the second husband of Eleanor Arundel, widow of Sir Thomas Browne, who had likewise been executed in 1460.
In Shakespeare's "Richard III", Vaughan's ghost appears to the King on the eve of the Battle of Bosworth.

William N. Oatis

William Nathan Oatis (January 4, 1914 – September 16, 1997) was an American journalist who gained international attention when he was charged with espionage by the Czechoslovak government in 1951. He was subsequently jailed until 1953.
Early life.
Born in Marion, Indiana, Oatis began his journalism career with his high school newspaper, studied at DePauw University for one year and in 1933 returned to Marion, where he worked for the "Leader-Tribune". In 1937, he started working for the Associated Press in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Oatis served in the U.S Army during World War II, studying Japanese at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. In 1950, he married Laurabelle Zack, who worked in the AP's reference library in New York. The marriage took place in London.
Arrest and detention.
Oatis was working as the AP bureau chief in Prague, Czechoslovakia when he was arrested on April 23, 1951. Deprived of sleep and subjected to continuous interrogation for 42 hours, Oatis signed a statement confessing to the charge of espionage. The case made international headlines, as well as leading to trade and travel embargos against Czechoslovakia. On July 4, 1951, a Czechoslovak court sentenced Oatis to ten years in prison. He was released May 16, 1953, shortly after the death of Joseph Stalin and after an angry letter from President Dwight D. Eisenhower to the Czechoslovak government. The Czechoslovak government said it had been moved to pardon Oatis by a poignant plea from Oatis' wife, Laurabelle. A Czechoslovak court cleared him of all charges in 1959, but the decision was reversed in 1968 after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1990, after Czechoslovakia's "Velvet Revolution" the previous year, he was cleared again. 
The Voice of America called Oatis "the first American martyr to press freedom behind the Iron Curtain." The United States Department of State denounced the Czechoslovak verdict as a ludicrous travesty and the U.S. press said Oatis was condemned for no more than doing his job as a reporter. The case's Orwellian overtones were highlighted by the prosecution's assertion at the show trial that Oatis, a careful reporter, was "particularly dangerous because of his discretion and insistence on obtaining only accurate, correct, verified information." Oatis contracted tuberculosis during his imprisonment and sought treatment shortly after his release.
Later career.
Oatis went on to cover the United Nations for three decades and retired in 1984 after a 47-year career at the AP. He was elected president of the United Nations Correspondents Association in 1970. In 1992, Oatis was inducted into the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame.
Oatis died September 16, 1997 at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, New York from complications of Alzheimer's disease. He was survived by his sons Jonathan and Jeremy. His wife Laurabelle died of natural causes on June 19, 2012, at the age of 88.

Red Rubber Ball

"Red Rubber Ball" is a pop song that became a hit (going to #2 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and hitting #1 in Canadian "RPM 100" national singles chart) in the 1966 version recorded by The Cyrkle.
The song is sung from the perspective of a man who has recently exited an unfulfilling relationship in which his significant other never gave him much attention or affection. He now looks forward to the future with a positive attitude.
It was co-written by Paul Simon (of Simon and Garfunkel) and Bruce Woodley (of The Seekers). According to Cyrkle guitarist Tom Dawes, Simon offered it to The Cyrkle when they were opening for Simon and Garfunkel on tour. The song's tracks were recorded in stereo, with the bass, lead guitar, and percussion on the right track, acoustic guitar and electric organ on left, and the vocals on both.
The Seekers also recorded "Red Rubber Ball" for their 1966 album "Come the Day" (US-title: "Georgy Girl"). It also appears on 'Disc Three – 1966 – 1967' of the CD box set "The Seekers Complete".
In an interview on "The Colbert Report", Paul Simon said he wrote "Red Rubber Ball" while living in England to get a £100 advance from The Seekers. This came in response to Colbert's request for a song that was "on the cusp" and barely made it into his songbook "Lyrics 1964–2008".

life.
Bourequat is the son of an Alaouite princess and a Turko-Tunisian businessman who was also a security chief and helped found Morocco's police and Intelligence service. His father was also a close friend of Mohammed V and so Ali and his brothers grew up to be in the inner circle of the court of king Hassan II.
In 1973 he was, with his two brothers Midhat and Bayazid, abducted by the Moroccan secret police, tortured and jailed without trial for reasons he claims unknown even to himself. 
He was originally incarcerated in facilities close to Rabat and in 1973 succeeded in escaping along with the mutineers of the 1971 failed coup but was recaptured several days later. In 1981 he was transferred to the Tazmamart prison, a secret detention facility with a 50% death rate. His family was given no information on his whereabouts, consistent with the practice of the Moroccan regime in cases of "forced disappearance", and he was never charged with a crime.
In 1991 he was released after pressure from human rights organization Amnesty International and the American government, along with other surviving Tazmamart prisoners, including his brothers, on the condition that he leave for France never to return.
The French government had consistently cooperated with Morocco in denying his imprisonment, and Bourequat was scalding in his critique of Paris's collaboration with the Moroccan government. While writing about his experiences and about the close ties between the Moroccan government and the French government, Bourequat states he was threatened and harassed by both Moroccan and French secret police. He fled to the United States, where he was in 1995 granted asylum as the only American refugee from France.
He presently lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina (USA) where he remains a vocal critic of the Moroccan regime.

Nathaniel Mountain

Nathaniel Mountain is a mountain ridge that runs southwest northeast through Hampshire County in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle, rising to its greatest elevation of above sea-level. The mountain is bound at its western flank by the South Branch Potomac River and to its eastern flank by South Branch Mountain . The bulk of Nathaniel Mountain is located within the Nathaniel Mountain Wildlife Management Area (WMA) owned by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources.
The rugged topography of Nathaniel Mountain and its WMA is dominated by mature oak and hickory forests with Virginia pine. The mountain also supports a habitat for a variety of neo-tropical migratory birds and two wetlands identified by The Nature Conservancy. Nathaniel Mountain's forested wetlands are a unique find at such a high elevation. The wetlands include a number of plant species not common in the region, including sphagnum moss ("Sphagnum andersonianum") and the cinnamon fern ("Osmunda cinnamomea"). White-tailed deer, wild turkeys, squirrels, black bears, and grouse abound on the mountain, which make its WMA a popular regional hunting area. Nathaniel Mountain's Mill Run serves as a habitat for native brook trout and rainbow trout.

Whittington, Worcestershire

Whittington is a small village near Worcester close to Junction 7 of the M5 motorway, bounded by the motorway and the main Evesham to Worcester A44 trunk road, in the District of Wychavon. In fact the motorway cut through the village, most of it being on the west side but some houses were left on the east side.
Amenities & History.
There is one public house - The Swan, a village and parish church, and an active village hall. 
There is also an ancient burial mound referred to as "The Tump" across the main road A44 from the pub. The tump is thought to have been a barrow but no burial remains have been found there. The context of this ancient monument was devastated by the building of the M5 motorway a very short distance away, further damage being caused by the widening of the A44, which was rebuilt to bypass the village. It was then damaged again by the building on the north side of the Tump of the road going west to the new crossing of the River Severn south of Worcester. 
"Tump" is Worcestershire dialect for a small hill and maybe derived from the Welsh language word Twmpath. An unty tump is a molehill, unty being local dialect for a mole.
The village has a primary school.
The parish of Whittington also includes the hamlet of Swinsherd part of which was also lost to the building of the M5 motorway.

Red Sparowes is a Los Angeles post-rock band comprising current and former members of Isis, The Nocterns, Halifax Pier, Angel Hair and Pleasure Forever. Their sound is characteristic of soundscape-influenced experimental rock, with an otherwise uncommon extensive use of a pedal steel guitar.
History.
Red Sparowes formed in 2003 as another project for its members. Through signing to Neurot Recordings, Neurosis' record label, Red Sparowes toured with The Dillinger Escape Plan and Made Out of Babies in 2004 after recording demos for their debut album. The debut was recorded in May 2004 by engineer Desmond Shea, with the resulting sound in the vein of guitarists Bryant Clifford Meyer and Jeff Caxide's band Isis, Chicago post-rock/metal outfit Pelican, as well as bands as varied as Sonic Youth and The Cure. Members Jeff Caxide and Dana Berkowitz relocated in late 2004, thus forcing them out of the band.
Red Sparowes' first studio album, "At the Soundless Dawn", was released in February 2005, following Clifford Meyer's Isis in their initial tours in support of "Panopticon". Shortly after this release, a split 12" album was released with Gregor Samsa. The Red Sparowes side contained the second track from "At the Soundless Dawn", "Buildings Began to Stretch Wide Across the Sky, And the Air Filled with a Reddish Glow," as well as a track recorded during the album's recording sessions with guitar by Michael Gallagher of Isis, initially only available on the Japanese release of the album. Following the release of the album, the band headlined a tour in Europe and participated in an American tour with Pelican, Big Business and Breather Resist. After touring the band released their follow-up record, "Every Red Heart Shines Toward the Red Sun", in 2006. This release was followed by more touring of North America and Europe, including shows in the US with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.
In 2008 Josh Graham parted ways with the rest of the band to pursue musical project A Storm of Light.
In May 2008, Red Sparowes recorded new material with engineer Toshi Kasai (Melvins, Big Business, Tool), and in August that year the EP Aphorisms was released digitally.
Red Sparowes began recording their third full length studio album with Kasai on August 24, 2009. The album, titled "The Fear Is Excruciating, But Therein Lies the Answer", was released on April 6, 2010.

<doc id="2851358" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851358" title="Don Juan Triumphant">
Don Juan Triumphant

Don Juan Triumphant is the name of a fictional piece of music written by the title character in the novel "The Phantom of the Opera". In the musical adaptation, the concept is expanded as an opera within a musical.
The novel.
In the novel by French novelist Gaston Leroux, "Don Juan Triumphant" () is an initially unfinished piece that Erik, the Phantom, has been working on for a period of 20 plus years. At one point, he remarks that once he completes it, he will take the score into the coffin he uses for a bed and never wake up. Erik plays a section of his opera following his unmasking at the hands of Christine Daaé, who is stunned by the power of the music. As she describes it, the music takes the listener through every detail of suffering of "the ugly man," taking her into the abyss of the wretched torment and misery Erik has experienced in his life. The piece makes Pain divine. At the end, the piece takes a rapid ascent out of misery whirling up into a triumphant and victorious flight... as Ugliness, lifted on the wings of love, dared to look Beauty in the face. 
Erik's choice of title and use of "Don Juan" is never truly explained, so it remains subject to various interpretations. Initially, when Christine sees the score and asks him to play it for her, Erik gets highly defensive and tells her never to ask him that again, and that she is lucky not to come to that kind of music yet, as his Don Juan "burns" with fire not from heaven and would consume anyone who came near it. Whereas Mozart's and Lorenzo da Ponte's Don Giovanni, inspired by vice and petty love affairs, will only make one weep. After unmasked and his hideousness is revealed, Erik spitefully, and probably sarcastically, remarks that he is the same kind of man as Don Juan, because once a woman sees him, she loves him forever. He yells to her that he is Don Juan triumphant. Eventually he crawls into his room to play his masterpiece to "forget the horror of the moment." Christine is so moved by what she hears that for a fleeting moment she believes that his hideous appearance no longer matters.
Erik finishes Don Juan Triumphant before the novel's end, and, instead of just automatically taking it with him into his coffin to die like he had originally said, he then wants instead to live a normal life doing normal things, with a wife, like everyone else. Earlier he is shown exclaiming that it "must be finished first!" with a sense of urgency. It seems to suggest that in Christine he saw hope of a new life, distinct from the darkness and passionate misery with which Don Juan Triumphant was created, and which had defined his life up until that point.
The narrator comments that the work was never found in the 30 years since Erik's death, and speculates that it may still be in his house next to the subterranean lake beneath the Paris Opera.
The musical.
In the musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, "Don Juan Triumphant" figures prominently in the second act as an opera within a musical and is a thinly veiled adaptation of Mozart's "Don Giovanni" which premiered in Prague in 1787, only told from Don Juan's point of view. In this version, the Phantom forces the opera company to stage his work and orders Christine, a Swedish soprano and his protege with whom he is in love, to be cast in the lead role. She reluctantly agrees to do so only after her fiance, Raoul, devises a plan to catch the Phantom during the opening night performance. The score of Don Juan Triumphant is noticeably different from the style and staging of the rest of the piece and indeed the operas the company perform on stage. It is dissonant, with darker tones and key changes closer to modern compositions. All of which serve to heighten the idea of the Phantom's genius- that as a composer he is musically ahead of his time.
Only a small portion of the opera is seen onstage, in which Don Juan (played by leading tenor Ubaldo Piangi) and his servant, Passarino, make plans for Don Juan's seduction of the maiden Aminta (Christine). Passarino, dressed as Don Juan and hiding his face, is the one who made her acquaintance. According to the plan, he is to leave the house before Aminta arrives for a dinner with Don Juan, who has assumed Passarino's identity. Passarino, pretending to be Don Juan, will announce his return later, prompting Don Juan (pretending to be Passarino) to suggest that Aminta hide with him in a bedroom to avoid being found. As soon as Piangi slips into a hiding place to await the start of the scene, he is quietly strangled by the Phantom, who takes his place and sings "" with Christine before declaring his love in front of the whole audience. The opera breaks up into chaos when she exposes his horribly deformed face and Piangi's body is found, leading to the finale of the musical ("Down Once More"/"Track Down This Murderer").
In the film adaptation of the musical, the audience at the opera house is seen recoiling in shock at the jarring discordance and staging of Don Juan Triumphant, which is very different from the traditional opera stagings they are used to. It is also arguably more sexualised with the costumes of the company compared to the stage show far more form flattering and tighter. Christine's dress for example changes from the low cut pink dress of the show to a sleeveless Spanish- style dress complete with a flower in her hair. The Phantom's costume as well has varied considerably. In the show when he reappears playing the part of Don Juan his entire face and body are covered with a cloak and hood. In the film he performs the number in a red torrider outfit and black eye mask which in turn alerts Christine and the audience to the fact that it is the Phantom singing to her immediately. In the show Christine comes to the moment of realization varies depending upon the performer. In some performances the Phantom places his hands in front of Christine's face/eyes a gesture he did in Music of Night, which alarms her in other versions Christine at one point feels the Phantom's mask when she touches his face through the cloak and reacts accordingly.
In other works.
In Susan Kay's 1990 novel "Phantom", it is mentioned that it was a piece solely based on passion and anger, as Erik's (the Phantom) childhood gypsy captor sardonically nicknamed him "Don Juan". When Christine hears Erik playing it, he remarks, "...I raped her with my music."
In Nicholas Meyer's 1993 novel "The Canary Trainer", Sherlock Holmes attempts to recover the Phantom's copy of "Don Juan Triumphant" from beneath the Paris Opera, but is unable to locate it.
In Frederick Forsyth's 1999 novel "The Phantom of Manhattan", which is a sequel to the musical, it is stated that "Don Juan Triumphant" was never performed again after its debut performance in the musical. During the novel, Erik composes a second play for Christine to perform, "The Angel of Shiloh", about a love triangle between a Virginian plantation-owner's daughter, a deformed Connecticut officer, and a Virginian cavalryman set during the Battle of Shiloh during the American Civil War.

Marlboro Friday

Marlboro Friday refers to April 2, 1993, when Philip Morris announced a 20% price cut to their Marlboro cigarettes to fight back against generic competitors, which were increasingly eating into their market share. 
As a result, Philip Morris's stock fell 26%, and the share value of other branded consumer product companies, including Coca-Cola and RJR Nabisco, fell as well. The broad index fell 1.98% that day. 
Fortune magazine deemed Marlboro Friday "the day the Marlboro Man fell off his horse." for Philip Morris Investors interpreted the price slash as an admission of defeat from the Marlboro brand, that Philip Morris could no longer justify its higher price tag and now had to compete with generic brands. 
Since the Marlboro man was an image that stood since 1954, it was considered one of the biggest marketing icons, investors reasoned that to see the Marlboro icon give in to a price war, the marketing itself must be ineffective. As a result of plummeting stock value in major American brands, 1993 marked a slight decrease in U.S. ad expenditures.
It was the only decrease to occur since 1970. At the time, this event was regarded as signifying "the death of a brand" and the advent of a "value-minded" consumer generation who pay more attention to the real value of products and not the brand names. This view soon proved to be incorrect, with the rest of the decade's economy being dominated by brands and driven by high-budget marketing campaigns.

St. John the Baptist Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine

St. John the Baptist Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine is a prominent Ukrainian Catholic church in Ottawa, Canada. 
History.
The only Ukrainian Catholic parish in the Ottawa region, the St. John the Baptist parish first formed in 1914. After meeting in other parishes' churches for some years, in 1918 the parish purchased a building to the west of downtown and converted it into a church. 
The congregation of St. John the Baptist Ukrainian Catholic Church erected a memorial scroll which is dedicated to the memory of the members of this Parish who served during the Second World War. 
In 1966 it moved into a temporary building on Carling Avenue. It was planned to build a permanent church on that site, but the location proved too small.
The current church was built in 1987. It is located near the intersection of Baseline Road and Prince of Wales Drive, overlooking the Rideau Canal and Carleton University. The ornate structure in Konstantin Thon's Neo-Byzantine style, was in part built to celebrate the millennium of the Baptism of Kiev . The artworks (icons and stained glass windows) within were done by two artists from Ukraine and three local artists. Despite being only a parish church, due to its national status it was granted the title of Sobor. The church is owned and operated by the Basilians.

Sinatra Swings

Sinatra Swings (alternately titled Swing Along with Me) is an album by Frank Sinatra, released in 1961.
The album's two titles derive from the fact that Capitol thought this album, originally titled "Swing Along With Me", was so close in sound and title to Sinatra's earlier Capitol album "Come Swing with Me!" that the label sought, and was granted, a court order requiring Reprise to change the title of this, only his second Reprise album, to "Sinatra Swings". Reprise was not required to recall LPs already shipped, but had to print new labels and jackets. All compact disc releases have retained the artwork with the alternate title intact.
It was advertised on the record sleeve as featuring "twelve of the most uninhibited Sinatra things ever recorded." The tracks were arranged and conducted by Billy May and his orchestra. Sinatra had a small hit with the single Granada included on this album.

Adventure (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)

In the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game, an adventure or module is a pre-packaged book or box set that helps the Dungeon Master manage the plot or story of a game. The term "adventure" is currently used by the game's publisher Wizards of the Coast.
In early editions of the game these publications were commonly referred to as "modules", which stems from the term "dungeon module", used to refer to the earliest adventures published by TSR, with other variations on the module name appearing on latter adventures. The term "module" continued to be popular among players of the original Dungeons & Dragons and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons even after newer publications were labeled "adventure". Adventures that appear as a part of a larger accessory are often referred to as scenarios.
The exact differences between the terms adventure, module, scenario, and accessory are hard to precisely define in Dungeons & Dragons terminology, as they all have been used in different ways.
History of official modules and adventures.
The first published Dungeons & Dragons scenario was "Temple of the Frog", included in 1975's "Blackmoor" Dungeons & Dragons rules supplement. This scenario was later developed into the stand-alone module DA2 – "Temple of the Frog" for the "D&D Expert set" rules (TSR, 1986).
The first stand-alone Dungeons & Dragons adventure module, "Palace of the Vampire Queen", was published in 1976 by Wee Warriors. Although TSR did not produce this module, the company did distribute the first three printings on behalf of Wee Warriors. The adventure was described as a "Dungeon Masters Kit" rather than a "module" or an "adventure".
Also in 1976, the adventure "Lost Caverns of Tsojconth" was distributed by Metro Detroit Gamers as the tournament module for the gaming convention Wintercon V, but was not published for general distribution at the time. The adventure was later re-written for the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules and published as module S4 – "The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth" (TSR, 1982).
Additional unpublished adventures were distributed at gaming conventions during this period, including "Steading of the Hill Giant Chief", used as a tournament module for Origins '78. Later in 1978, "Steading of the Hill Giant Chief" became the first stand-alone Dungeons & Dragons module actually produced and published by TSR. TSR Hobbies produced a series of six adventures in 1978 that had previously only been used in tournaments. The company initiated its practice of assigning a code to each module published at the time, assigning the "G1" code to "Steading of the Hill Giant Chief". TSR's practice of coding modules into various series would continue into the 1990s.
Contents of Adventures.
The standard adventure is essentially an "adventure kit" including a backstory, maps and one or more objectives for the players to fulfill. Some include numerous illustrations. A Dungeon Master could purchase these pre-made adventures and use it or parts of it for a gaming session. The early format was a single booklet inserted, but not fixed, in a cardboard cover. As time went by the format and information included in module increased in variety. Dark Sun modules, for example, contained top-spiralbound notebooks. Eventually, the line blurred somewhat between what was an accessory or supplement and a module.
Modules had a suggested character level, often displayed prominently on the cover, and from the late 1980s prominently display the logo of the campaign setting they were set in. Some modules were reprints or revisions of modules used at gaming conventions before being published. All early modules are now out of print, though some have been reprinted in revised form. As such, many early modules are now highly sought-out collector items, particularly the earliest printings.
Module Codes.
Except for a few early limited edition modules, all Dungeons & Dragons modules up until late 1994 were denoted with an alphanumeric code consisting of a letter and a number. The letter codes were based in some way on the product, with the number following the letter designating what number the product was in the series. Modules within a letter set were usually somehow related, either thematically or as a series of linked adventures. For example, Z1 may be a prologue to Z2. Or Z1, Z2 and Z3 may have the adventurers fighting a similar enemy such as beholders. Though related, most modules were stand-alone and could be played without playing any of the other related modules.
TSR also used the module coding system on modules for several of non-"Dungeons & Dragons" roleplaying games including modules for " (Advanced) Marvel Super-Heroes" and the "Conan Roleplaying Game". The module code was de-emphasised in the late 1980s, which also saw the campaign setting logo become a main feature of the cover. The code was dropped altogether by the end of 1993. In 2008, the adventure code was reintroduced with the release of the 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons adventure: H1 Keep on the Shadowfell.

Five-dimensional space

In physics and mathematics, a sequence of "N" numbers can be understood to represent a location in an "N"-dimensional space.
Abstract five-dimensional space occurs frequently in mathematics, and is a legitimate construct. Whether or not the real universe in which we live is somehow five-dimensional is a topic that is debated and explored in several branches of physics, including astrophysics and particle physics. 
In physics, the fifth dimension is a hypothetical extra dimension beyond the usual three spatial dimensions and one time dimension of Relativity. The Kaluza–Klein theory used the fifth dimension to unify gravity with the electromagnetic force; e.g. Minkowski space and Maxwell's equations in vacuum can be embedded in a five-dimensional Riemann curvature tensor. Kaluza–Klein theory today is seen as essentially a gauge theory, with gauge group the circle group. M-theory suggests that space–time has 11 dimensions, seven of which are "rolled up" to below the subatomic level. Physicists have speculated that the graviton, a particle thought to carry the force of gravity, may "leak" into the fifth or higher dimensions, which would explain how gravity is significantly weaker than the other three fundamental forces.
In 1993 the physicist Gerard 't Hooft put forward the holographic principle, which explains that the "information about an extra dimension is visible as a curvature in a spacetime with one fewer dimension". For example, holograms are three-dimensional pictures placed on a two-dimensional surface, which gives the image a curvature when the observer moves. Similarly, in general relativity, the fourth dimension is manifested in observable three dimensions as the curvature path of a moving infinitesimal (test) particle. Hooft has speculated that the fifth dimension is really the "spacetime fabric".
Five-dimensional geometry.
Polytopes.
In five or more dimensions, only three regular polytopes exist. In five dimensions, they are:
A fourth polytope can be constructed as an alternation of the 5-cube, and is called a 5-demicube, with half the vertices (16), bounded by alternating 5-cell and 16-cell hypercells.
The 5-simplex is self-dual, and the 5-cube and 5-orthoplex are dual to each other. The 5-demicube can be constructed by removing alternate vertices of the 5-cube.
The following are three projected images of the edges of a 5-cube:
Hypersphere.
A hypersphere in 5-space (also called a 4-sphere due to its surface being 4-dimensional) consists of the set of all points in 5-space at a fixed distance "r" from a central point P. The hypervolume enclosed by this hypersurface is:
In popular culture.
In popular usage, the "fifth dimension" is often used to refer to unexplored or unknown aspects of the universe, and not necessarily to the mathematical concept of a 5-dimensional space. For example, the opening narration of "The Twilight Zone" begins: "There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man." In the fictional universe of DC Comics, the "fifth dimension" is said to be the place from which Mister Mxyzptlk, a Superman villain, comes. The 1965 "Lost in Space" TV show episode “Invaders from the Fifth Dimension” features hostile aliens from the fifth dimension, and the Robot describes their spaceship by saying: “The craft is surrounded by a force field in the fifth dimension, which is... mathematically... impossible.” In 1966, The Byrds released an album titled "Fifth Dimension", using the fifth dimension as a metaphor for unexplored and unknown aspects of the universe and oneself. The 5th Dimension is the name of an American vocal music group popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In Hindu philosophy, the fifth dimension of love of the Divine is termed by the Gaudiya Vaisnavas as turyatita, the dimension of the soul's Soul. The original "Doctor Who" episode hints at the 5th dimension being key to the abilities of the TARDIS.
Other uses of the "fifth dimension" are closer to its mathematical meaning. For example, the novel "The Boy Who Reversed Himself" features 4-dimensional and 5-dimensional spaces, using the mathematical fact that a 3-dimensional object can be turned into its mirror image if additional spatial dimensions were available for it to rotate through. The characters in Madeleine L'Engle's novel "A Wrinkle In Time" use the fifth dimension as a "dimensional shortcut" to travel through space. A similar concept appears in the Powerpuff Girls episode "Bring Back Jojo", where a creature able to see higher dimensions takes a dimensional shortcut through a fifth dimension to travel through time. The "Red Dwarf" episode "Parallel Universe" refers to the fifth dimension as the space in which multiple four-dimensional spaces exist.
Not all references to the "fifth dimension" in the mathematical sense involve time travel or space travel; Douglas Adams' book "Mostly Harmless" advances the idea of the fifth dimension being probability.
In Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, valet Koroviev in an explanation to Margarita attributes the expansion of a small apartment into the size of a large auditorium to the fifth dimension.
In the "original" or "boxed" version of the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game rulebooks (discontinued in 2000), consisting of the Basic set, and then the Expert, Companion, Master and Immortals expansion sets, a five-dimensional model was proposed in the Masters set where characters from the ordinary plane had the first, second and third dimensions as their three-dimensional home, but other-dimensional beings called the third, fourth and fifth dimension home. Upon perceiving each other, each thought the other kind to be horribly deformed "demons".
In "Family Guy", Mayor Adam West sends Alex Trebek, host of "Jeopardy", to the fifth dimension by making him say his name backwards, commenting, "Only saying his name backwards can send him back to the fifth dimension where he belongs." This is a parody of Mr. Mxyzptlk's weakness in the Superman comics.
In a well-received 2010 CBS commercial for "How I Met Your Mother", "Accidentally on Purpose", "Two and a Half Men", "The Big Bang Theory", and the "Late Show with David Letterman", an announcer states that "Everyone has 3-D, but only CBS has comedy in 5-D." This was a reference to the growing popularity of 4-D film in the later half of 2009, suggesting that certain programs on CBS feature 5-dimensional effects. By the end of the commercial, however, it is revealed that the letter D in 5-D does not stand for "Dimension," but stands for "Delightful, Delicious, Daring, Demented, and Dave."

Gladys Root

Gladys Towles Root (1905–1982) was a successful criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles, known for her piercing cross-examinations. Root was forced to specialize in sexual assault and murder cases because no other work was available to her.
Early life.
Root was the daughter of Clara Dexter Towles and Charles Towles of Los Angeles. She was born in 1905 and grew up in comfortable surroundings. 
There were very few women practicing law when Root graduated from USC School of Law in 1930. Root was unable to obtain employment and decided to open her own practice. Gladys Towles Root opened her office at 212 South Hill Street, Los Angeles California, the former location of the legendary Rainbow Saloon. 
Because no other work was available to her, Root began defending rape and murder cases. She became so skilled that by the early 1960s young prosecutors and defense attorneys would gather to watch her cross-examination of prosecuting witnesses.
Legal career.
Root served as president of the Southern California Women Lawyers in 1945. 
In July 1964 an indictment was issued against Gladys by the Federal Grand Jury in connection with her actions during her defense of one of the defendants in the kidnapping case of Frank Sinatra, Jr., the teenage son of Frank Sinatra. Three men had kidnapped Frank Sinatra Jr. from across the California-Nevada state line at Lake Tahoe and transported him to Los Angeles. The kidnappers collected $240,000 ransom. Gladys was hired to defend one of the kidnappers, John William Irwin, and defended him with zeal. Charges were brought against Gladys based on her allegedly fabricating the story that the young singer concocted the kidnapping for publicity reasons. Gladys was indicted in 1964 on charges of conspiracy, suborning perjury, and obstruction of justice. The charges were dropped in 1968.
Root fought with the Internal Revenue Service, beginning in the 1970s. The IRS contended that she owed more than $230,000 in back taxes when interest and penalties were included. She fought the judgment and lost in the federal appeals court in 1977. She attempted to appeal to the United States Supreme Court but the highest court in the land refused to hear the case.
She presented a flamboyant figure in the courtroom. She was especially known for the large, dramatic hats she almost always wore to court.
Death.
On Tuesday, December 21, 1982, Gladys Towles Root collapsed into the arms of her protégé David Brockway, Esq. and died at age 77 of a heart attack during an appearance in a Los Angeles Superior Court – Pomona courtroom. She was in court to defend one of two brothers (David Brockway defended the other) accused of rape. On the day of her death, Gladys was attired completely in gold. 
Gladys was buried at Forest Lawn Glendale. She was buried in a gold dress with Madonna earrings.

Tulipa turkestanica

Tulipa turkestanica (Turkestan tulip) is a species of tulip native to central Asia. It was first described by Eduard August von Regel in 1875.
Description.
"Tulipa turkestanica" is a herbaceous, bulbous perennial growing 10 cm to 15 cm tall, with 2–4 thin glaucous leaves up to 15 cm long on each stem. The margins and tips have a pinkish colour. The leathery bulb is bright reddish-brown and has a hairy tunic. Each plant produces between one and twelve star-shaped flowers. The flowers are ivory white to pinkish red, with a yellow to orange basal blotch, which extends to about a third of the flower. The backs of the outer tepals are greyish red with a whitish fringe and much wider than the inner tepals, which have a thin, green line on the middle of their outside. The filaments are orange, and the anthers are dark violet or yellow with a violet tip, which distinguishes it from "T. biflora" that has very similar flowers but yellow anthers. It is also slightly smaller and flowers slightly earlier. The flowers only open in direct sunlight. The smell is described as unpleasant. In the wild, it flowers between March and May, depending on the altitude.
Distribution.
The Turkestan tulip is found in the Pamir Alai and Tien Shan; Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkestan, Iran and Dzungaria in Northwest China.
. It grows on stony slopes, river margins and rocky ledges between 1800–2500 m asl.
Cultivation and uses.
"Tulipa turkestanica" is an ornamental plant often grown in rock gardens. It needs full sun. In England, it flowers in the middle of March. As other tulips of the Eriostemenes group, "Tulipa turkestanica" cannot be crossed with garden tulips.

Margaret Theresa of Spain

Margaret Theresa of Spain (Spanish: Margarita Teresa, German: Margarete Theresia; 12 July 1651 – 12 March 1673) was Holy Roman Empress, German Queen, Archduchess consort of Austria, Queen consort of Hungary and Bohemia. She was the daughter of King Philip IV of Spain and his second wife Mariana of Austria. She was the elder sister of Charles II, the last of the Spanish Habsburgs. She is the central figure in the famous "Las Meninas" by Diego Velázquez, and subject of many of his later paintings.
Life.
For political reasons, Margaret Theresa was betrothed as a child to her maternal uncle and paternal cousin, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. Her father stipulated that she should maintain her position in the line of succession to the Spanish throne and would pass her succession rights to her descendants, something Leopold I gladly accepted.
In the summer of 1666, saddened by her father's death on 17 September 1665, the 15 year old infanta left her native Spain and traveled to Austria. She was accompanied by several Spanish attendants, and was solemnly welcomed by her future husband, her uncle Leopold. Their wedding took place in the city of Vienna, on 12 December 1666. Despite the difference in their ages, some 11 years, they were very happy together, as they shared a number of interests, especially theatre and music.
After giving birth to four children, and weakened by many miscarriages, Margaret Theresa died at the age of 21. Her only surviving child was Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria, future Electress of Bavaria. Margaret Theresa was buried in the Imperial Crypt, in Vienna.
Children.
Margaret Theresa and Leopold were parents to four children:
Christie's auction of Margaret Theresa's diamond.
One of the diamonds of Margaret Theresa was auctioned at Christie's in December 2008. Referred to as the Wittelsbach Diamond, it was given by her father king Philip IV of Spain as part of the dowry when she married Leopold I of Austria at the age of 15. The diamond was obtained in India (as it was custom from the Royal Families at that time to bring their diamonds from India, either Hyderabad or Bihar). As of today, it is one of the few lasting Indian diamonds together with the Kohinoor (today part of the British Crown Jewels), the Régent (today in the Louvre), the Orlov (in the Kremlin) or the Hope Diamond, in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC.
Christie's, the famous auction house, sold the nearly diamond for $24.3 million, which is the highest price paid for a diamond sold at an auction.
Depictions in art.
Margaret Theresa is the blonde princess depicted in the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez' masterpiece "Las Meninas" ("The Maids of Honor", 1656), where she is surrounded by her ladies-in-waiting and other persons of the Spanish court.
There are other pictures of her, also painted by Velázquez at various stages of her childhood, where she is shown wearing Baroque dresses, which were typical of the court of Madrid during the Spanish Golden Age. These portraits were usually sent by King Philip IV to the court of Vienna in order to keep Leopold apprised of how young Margaret Theresa looked and how she was doing at the distant Spanish court.
Margaret Theresa also features in a number of Pablo Picasso's 58 interpretations of Diego Velázquez' "Las Meninas", which he produced between August and December 1957. These currently occupy the Las Meninas room of the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, Spain.

Can Dialectics Break Bricks?

La Dialectique Peut-Elle Casser Des Briques?, in English, "Can Dialectics Break Bricks?", is a 1973 Situationist film produced by the French director René Viénet which explores the development of class conflict through revolutionary agitation against a backdrop of graphic kung-fu fighting.
The film uses 1972 martial arts film "Crush" by Tu Guangqi, which tells the story of anti-colonialist revolt in Korea during the period of Japanese occupation, for its visuals which has been dubbed over by the filmmakers in an attempt at détournement. The concept and motivation of this film was to adapt a "spectacular" film into a radical critique of cultural hegemony and thus into tools of subversive revolutionary ideals.
The Narrative is based upon a conflict between the proletarian and bureaucrats within state capitalism. The proletarians enlist their dialectics and radical subjectivity to fight their oppressors whilst the bureaucrats defend themselves using a combination of co-optation and violence. The film is noted for its humorous approach to this serious subject matter.
The film also contains many praising references to revolutionaries who thought and fought for the realisation of a post-capitalist world, including Marx, Bakunin, and Wilhelm Reich, as well as scathing criticism towards the French Communist Party, trade unionism and Maoism. Also Subplots dealing with issues of gender equality, alienation, Paris Commune, May 1968, and the Situationist themselves are riddled throughout the film.

Hare Trigger

Hare Trigger is a 1945 Warner Brothers Merrie Melodies cartoon short starring Bugs Bunny directed by Friz Freleng. It marks the first appearance of Yosemite Sam, who appears as a train robber. Mel Blanc does both characters' voices.
The title is a play on "hair trigger", referring to any weapon or other device with a sensitive trigger.
This is the first cartoon with a shorter version of the Merrily We Roll Along music.
Plot.
After opening credits underscored by a lively instrumental of "Cheyenne", an old-fashioned train is seen rolling along through the desert. It passes another train going around a utility pole, and voices are heard repeating "Bread and Butter".
Bugs is riding in the mail car of a train, singing a nonsense song called "Go Get the Axe", when a pint-sized bandit attempts to rob the train (with the underscore playing stereotypical "villain music"), only to have it pass clear over his head. He then calls for his horse, which he needs a rolling step-stair to mount. He catches up and boards the train and begins to rob it while the mail clerk wraps himself in a package marked "DON'T OPEN 'TIL XMAS". The bandit accidentally throws Bugs Bunny in his sack. Bugs assumes he's Jesse James. The bandit scoffs and tells him (and the audience) who he actually is: "I'm Yosemite Sam, the meanest, toughest, rip-roarin'-est, Edward Everett Horton-est "hombre" what ever packed a six-shooter!" (This pattern of Sam introducing himself to Bugs and the audience would continue in other cartoons.) Bugs tells Sam that there is another tough guy in the train packing a "seven-shooter", and Sam goes looking for him – and he is actually Bugs in disguise.
Various fights ensue, as each character temporarily gets the upper hand for a while. After another skirmish, Bugs tricks Sam into dashing into a lounge car in which a horrific fight is occurring, actually stock film footage of a stereotypical western saloon fight, taken from the Warner Brothers western Dodge City. With the sounds of crashes and bangs in the background, Bugs calmly sings "Sweet Georgia Brown" to himself. Sam emerges tottering, banged and bruised, to a comical instrumental of "Rally 'Round the Flag", and a race-based gag occurs that is subtle enough it is usually left intact in network showings: Bugs effects the stereotyped voice of an African-American train porter, and has the dazed Sam convinced he's supposed to disembark the train, piling him up with luggage; Sam even hands Bugs a silver coin as a tip, and Bugs says, "Thank you, suh!" As Sam steps off the moving train, the mail-drop hook grabs him and temporarily whisks him off the train. Bugs thinks he has vanquished Sam, and yells "So long, screwy, see ya in Saint Louie!" in a line that will be echoed in "Bugs Bunny Rides Again" and "A Feather in His Hare". But he gets back on board somehow.
Finally, Sam has Bugs tied up, dangling from a rope, weighted down by an anvil, and fiendishly cutting through the rope, while the train is passing over a gorge. The screen fills with the words the narrator (also Mel Blanc, in pretty much his natural voice) is saying, "Is this the end of Bugs Bunny? Will our hero be dashed to bits on the jagged rocks below?" and so on. Then Bugs walks across the screen, dressed in top hat and tails, carrying a bag full of gold (reward money), and dragging the tied-up villain behind him, mocking the on-screen words ("Is he to be doomed to utter destruction? Will he be rendered non compos mentis?"). Bugs closes by turning to the audience and repeating a popular radio catch-phrase from Red Skelton's "Mean Widdle Kid": "He don't know me vewy well, do he?" as a bar of "Kingdom Coming" plays on the track at iris-out.

Hayles was born in Saint Louis, Missouri to Edward and Thelma Bruns. She received her B.S. in Chemistry from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 1966, and her M.S. in Chemistry from the California Institute of Technology in 1969. She worked as a research chemist in 1966 at Xerox Corporation and as a chemical research consultant Beckman Instrument Company from 1968-1970. Hayles then switched fields and received her M.A. in English Literature from Michigan State University in 1970, and her Ph.D. in English Literature from the University of Rochester in 1977. She is a social and literary critic.
Career.
Her scholarship primarily focuses on the "relations between science, literature, and technology." Hayles has taught at UCLA, University of Iowa, University of Missouri–Rolla, the California Institute of Technology, and Dartmouth College. She was the faculty director of the Electronic Literature Organization from 2001-2006.
Key Concepts.
Human and Posthuman.
Hayles understands "human" and "posthuman" as constructions that emerge from historically specific understandings of technology, culture and embodiment; "human and "posthuman" views each produce unique models of subjectivity. Within this framework "human" is aligned with Enlightenment notions of liberal humanism, including its emphasis on the "natural self" and the freedom of the individual. Conversely, Posthuman does away with the notion of a "natural" self and emerges when human intelligence is conceptualized as being co-produced with intelligent machines. According to Hayles the posthuman view privileges information over materiality, considers consciousness as an epiphenomenon and imagines the body as a prosthesis for the mind . Specifically Hayles suggests that in the posthuman view "there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily existence and computer simulation..." The posthuman thus emerges as a deconstruction of the liberal humanist notion of "human."
Embodiment and Materiality.
Despite drawing out the differences between "human" and "posthuman", Hayles is careful to note that both perspectives engage in the erasure of embodiment from subjectivity. In the liberal humanist view, cognition takes precedence over the body, which is narrated as an object to possess and master. Meanwhile, popular conceptions of the cybernetic posthuman imagine the body as merely a container for information and code. Noting the alignment between these two perspectives, Hayles uses "How We Became Posthuman" to investigate the social and cultural processes and practices that led to the conceptualization of information as separate from the material that instantiates it. Drawing on diverse examples, such as Turing's Imitation Game, Gibson's "Neuromancer" and cybernetic theory, Hayles traces the history of what she calls "the cultural perception that information and materiality are conceptually distinct and that information is in some sense more essential, more important and more fundamental than materiality." By tracing the emergence of such thinking, and by looking at the manner in which literary and scientific texts came to imagine, for example, the possibility of downloading human consciousness into a computer, Hayles attempts to trouble the information/material separation and in her words, "...put back into the picture the flesh that continues to be erased in contemporary discussions about cybernetic subjects.”

Bowman Gum

Bowman Gum Company was a Philadelphia-based manufacturer of bubble gum and trading cards in the period surrounding World War II founded by Jacob Warren Bowman. Originally known as Gum, Inc., the company produced a series of cards known as the "Play Ball" sets each year from 1939 to 1941. Production halted after the United States entered the war, and the company did not return to making baseball, football, and other sports-related trading cards until 1948, then under the Bowman name.
In 1948, they were competing against Leaf Candy Company which left the marketplace in 1950, and in 1950 sold $1 million in baseball cards. For a few years, Bowman was the leading producer of baseball cards, but was overtaken by Topps Chewing Gum. After a period in which the two fought to sign players to exclusive contracts for their cards, Topps bought out Bowman in 1956 for $200,000. Much later, the Bowman brand was resurrected by Topps in 1989 to use on some of its subsidiary sports card sets. In recent years, the Bowman company has become known for being a top brand in making Rookie Cards.
Company history.
Blony grows Gum, Inc..
Jacob Warren Bowman, a U.S. chewing gum salesman, started his own company, Gum, Inc., in Philadelphia in 1927. Gum, Inc. started producing Blony bubble gum which immediately became the top selling penny bubble gum in the United States in 1929. The Blony trademark was registered by Bowman on January 13, 1931 (filed June 30, 1930). In 1937, Blony had 60 percent of the sales of bubble gum sold in the U.S., largely due to the fact that, weighing 210 grains, it was the largest piece of bubble gum sold for a penny. With the advertisement "Three Big BITES for a penny", Blony made Gum, Inc. "the biggest firm in the U. S. catering exclusively to the penny gum trade" according to a 1937 Time magazine article. By then, Gum, Inc. occupied five floors and the basement of a building on Woodland Avenue in Philadelphia. Blony gum came with color trading cards on various topics. A 1938 example was a series on battles of the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War. The motto "To know the HORRORS OF WAR is to want PEACE" appeared on each card, but children nicknamed the series "War Gum".
Early legal battles.
Franklin V. Canning became a partner with Bowman in 1930. Canning, a New York druggist who supplied the pink bubble gum base material to Gum, Inc., supplied working capital in return for 50 percent (250 shares) of the company stock. A subsidiary of The William Wrigley Jr. Company developed a better gum base in 1932, which sold for less than Canning's base. President Bowman demanded that Canning reduce the price of the gum base, which resulted in altercations between the two and ended in Bowman being ousted from the company in 1936. In July 1937, Bowman returned to the company after a long, bitter legal battle which ended in the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court upholding his reinstatement as president of the company. Gum, Inc. had earnings of $49,000 on sales estimated at about $800,000 in the first six months of 1937. In September 1937, Bowman's estranged second wife, Ruth, filed a suit against Bowman for part ownership of Gum, Inc., claiming a verbal agreement to a half-interest in his holdings.
Modern sports trading cards.
Bowman Chrome.
Another popular trading card set produced by Bowman is the Chrome set. After the success of the Chrome set by Topps, Topps created a Bowman Chrome set in 1997. This was initially fueled by Rookie Cards of José Cruz, Jr. and Travis Lee, but top RC's from it now are Roy Halladay's, Miguel Tejada's, Eric Chavez's, Kerry Wood's and Lance Berkman's cards. The set continued to be a mainstay, but it got a major jump in 2001 when Bowman decided to put Autographed Rookie Cards inside the base set. One of the Rookies that autographed cards for Bowman Chrome in 2001 was St. Louis Cardinals star Albert Pujols. This card continues to skyrocket in value, worth about $2,500 not graded. In 2002, autographed cards of MLB rising stars such as David Wright of the New York Mets, Joe Mauer of the Minnesota Twins and Bobby Jenks of the Chicago White Sox were inserted into the set.
Bowman Draft Picks and Prospects.
Bowman also creates a set called Bowman Draft Picks and Prospects. This set is like regular Bowman, but shows cards of MLB Draft Picks, participating players from the MLB All-Star Futures Game and MLB rookies that have had previous issues (veteran cards). Usually relic cards featuring swatches from jerseys of All-Star Futures Game players, other memorabilia cards and Non-rookie autographs called Signs Of The Future. Bowman "Draft" also has two chrome cards per pack, and the chrome subset has autographed rookie cards and all the parallels from regular bowman chrome. Many stars have had rookie cards in Bowman Draft Picks. 2002 Bowman Draft has rookie cards of Florida Marlins prospect Jeremy Hermida, Oakland Athletics outfielder Nick Swisher, Atlanta Braves outfielder Jeff Francoeur, Tampa Bay Devil Rays shortstop B.J. Upton, San Diego Padres shortstop Khalil Greene and Florida Marlins pitcher Dontrelle Willis. 2003 Bowman Draft Picks has rookie cards of Boston Red Sox pitcher Jonathan Papelbon, New York Yankees second baseman Robinson Canó, Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard, Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Rickie Weeks, Tampa Bay Devil Rays outfielder Delmon Young and Los Angeles Angels shortstop prospect Brandon Wood. This set also includes Grady Sizemore, Mark Buerhle, Ichiro, Chase Utley, J J Hardy, Huston Street, Dontrelle Willis, Josh Johnson, Jay Bruce, Jorge Cantu, Albert Pujols, and Jose Reyes.
AFLAC Redemption Set.
Making its debut in 2004, was Bowman's idea of redemption cards for a set of cards from the AFLAC High School All American game. Players included were Cameron Maybin, Andrew McCutchen, Chris Volstad, C. J. Henry, and Justin Upton. The sets were delayed and not shipped until 2006, and the Gold Refractor cards - originally intended to be 50 redemption sets - "accidentally" had over 50 redemption cards slip into packs, which caused them to be delayed even more. Topps sent out a letter asking customers if they wanted a three-card auto set consisting of C. J. Henry, Andrew McCutchen and Cameron Maybin. (Justin Upton was later added as a fourth person in the set) or the Gold Refractor set. The Gold Refractor set was shipped before the Auto Set.
Here are the Final Print Runs (Base and Base Chrome sets not numbered)
2004 Bowman Draft Picks and Prospects AFLAC Chrome Parallel and Auto Set Print Runs
Bowman's Best.
Bowman's Best started in 1994 and was the first Bowman product to have refractors. 1994 Bowman's Best key rookie cards were Jorge Posada, Billy Wagner and Edgar Rentería. Next years Bowman's Best would be one of the best Bowman sets ever. It had rookie cards of Vladimir Guerrero, Bobby Abreu, Andruw Jones, Hideo Nomo and Scott Rolen. The 1997 Bowman's Best set gave something new to the Bowman's Best brand that would stay with the Bowman's Best brand for a while. This set had Rookie Cards of Miguel Tejada, Kerry Wood and Roy Halladay, and the refractor parallels, but this time they had inserted autographed cards. Tony Gwynn and Derek Jeter were among the signers in this set, and there were refractor and atomic refractor parallels of the autographed cards. In 1999, Bowman's Best had autographed cards with two autographs on one card. In 2002, Bowman's Best had autographed and memorabilia rookie cards inside the base set. This set still has many autographs and stars such as Ryan Howard and Francisco Liriano have autographed cards for Bowman's Best.
Bowman Sterling.
Bowman Sterling was introduced in 2004. This set was an immediate hit. Collectors enjoyed the offerings of the set along with the refractor parallels. The base set is made up of Rookie Cards, Veteran GU cards, Autographed Game Used cards featuring a jersey swatch from the players jersey alongside an autograph and autographed RC's. This set was released again in 2005 and was a hit again. Regular Refractor cards are limited to 199 copies and are in regular packs. Black Refractors (limited to 25 copies) and Red Refractors (limited to 1 copy) and buyback cards, which are already released Bowman and Bowman Chrome cards which are purchased by Topps and signed by players, are inserted into the box loader packs. Box Loader packs are one per box and encased in a special topps holder.
Bowman Heritage.
Bowman Heritage is a set that pays tribute to older Bowman sets. These cards look like the cards produced by Bowman in the 1950s. These cards have autographed inserts called Signs Of Greatness and Game Used Jersey/Bat cards called Pieces Of Greatness. Even though they pay tribute to older Bowman sets, they still have many Rookie Cards of prospects and MLB Draft Picks.

Charley Lau

Charles Richard Lau (April 12, 1933, in Romulus, Michigan – March 18, 1984) was an American catcher and highly influential hitting coach in Major League Baseball. 
He was signed by the Detroit Tigers as an amateur free agent. After spending three seasons with the organization (1956, 1958–1959) he was traded (with Don Lee) to the Milwaukee Braves for Casey Wise, Don Kaiser, and Mike Roarke. After the Baltimore Orioles purchased him from the Braves in , he adopted a contact hitter's batting stance (feet wide apart, bat held almost parallel to the ground). That season he had a .294 batting average with six home runs and thirty-seven runs batted in. 
After hitting .194 in 23 games, he was sold by the Orioles to the Kansas City Athletics on July 1, 1963, hitting .294 in Kansas City and having a batting average of .272 in 92 games. On June 15, , he was traded back to the Orioles for Wes Stock. On May 31, 1967, he was purchased by the Braves, now located in Atlanta, and on November 27, 1967, he was released by the Braves.
On April 28, 1961, Lau caught the second of Warren Spahn's two career no-hitters.
Lau as a hitting coach.
After his playing career ended, Lau became a hitting coach for the Orioles, Oakland Athletics, Kansas City Royals, New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox. Contrary to popular belief, Lau did not emphasize releasing the top hand after making contact with the pitch and following through with only the lower hand on the bat. He did, however, suggest this measure to hitters who—for whatever reason—could not fully extend their arms during their swings. 
Lau developed a list of "Absolutes" about hitting, which included: 
Lau served as batting coach for the Royals from 1971 to 1978 (with the exception of the early part of the season when he was the team's minor league hitting coach after his temporary ouster from the Royals' staff by then-skipper Jack McKeon. He worked with Hal McRae, Amos Otis, Willie Wilson and George Brett. After becoming the Chicago White Sox' hitting instructor, his pupils included Greg Luzinski, Carlton Fisk, Steve Kemp, Harold Baines and Ron Kittle.
While serving as the White Sox hitting coach, he died in Key Colony Beach, Florida at the age of 50 after a long bout with cancer. Since his death, no White Sox player or coach (except Lau disciple Walt Hriniak, the Chisox' hitting coach from 1989 to 1995) has worn his number 6 jersey, although it has not been officially retired. The baseball field at Romulus Senior High School in his hometown is named the Charley Lau Baseball Field.
Off the field.
Lau also appeared in the film "Max Dugan Returns" as himself. The title character (played by Jason Robards, Jr.) pays Lau to teach his grandson (Matthew Broderick's character) how to hit.

South Branch Mountain

South Branch Mountain is a mountain ridge that runs southwest to northeast through Hampshire and Hardy counties in the Eastern Panhandle of the U.S. state of West Virginia, rising to its greatest elevation of 3,028 feet (923 m) above sea-level in the Nathaniel Mountain Wildlife Management Area. South Branch Mountain is among the largest and most prominent of the mountains in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians of the Eastern Panhandle region. It forms the eastern edge of the South Branch Potomac River Valley from Springfield to Moorefield. The mountain was originally named Jersey Mountain by colonial settlers in the eighteenth century after Jersey.
The Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) climbs South Branch Mountain between Shanks and Romney in an area known as Sunrise Summit. The forested wetlands that were once located here on the mountain's top were destroyed by the expansive commercial and residential developments in the Sunrise Summit area along US 50. Further south near Moorefield, the construction of Corridor H has caused increased disruption to South Branch Mountain's forests, habitats, and topography.

Brent Burns

William Brett Burns (born March 9, 1985) is a Canadian professional ice hockey right wing currently playing for the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played for the Minnesota Wild, during which time he was converted from forward to defenseman. During the 2012–13 season, he began playing again as a forward for the San Jose Sharks.
Playing career.
Burns was drafted by the Minnesota Wild in the first round, 20th overall, in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. Burns spent most of his minor hockey career playing for the Barrie Icemen and Ajax Knights of the OMHA. He spent two years playing in the Metropolitan Toronto Hockey league (MTHL) now called the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL) for the North York Canadiens, along with fellow NHL draftees Anthony Stewart and Geoff Platt. Burns then played his OHL career as a right wing with the Brampton Battalion in the 2002–03 season. He led the team in playoff scoring that season with five goals and six assists in 11 games. Burns was runner-up for Most Improved Player in the OHL as voted on by the leagues coaches.
Upon turning professional with the Wild in 2003, Burns was converted to defense by defensively minded coach Jacques Lemaire. Burns played in 36 games with Minnesota in the 2003–04 season, showing flashes of natural ability in rushing from the blueline. After spending the 2004 NHL Lockout in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Houston Aeros, Burns adapted as defenseman and earned a regular spot on the Wild team in the 2005–06 season, contributing 16 points in 72 games.
In the 2006–07 season, Burns eclipsed his previous seasons points total with 25 and became a significant force for the Wild in the later months of the season scoring back-to-back overtime winners in March and two fights during the playoffs.
On October 25, 2007, during the 2007–08 season, Burns signed a four-year contract extension with the Wild. Burns emerged as the Wild's best defenseman, establishing a career-high 15 goals and 43 points.
In the 2008–09 season, Burns was shifted between forward and defense with mild success, before he was hampered by a concussion which caused him to miss the final 19 games of the season. Burns' concussion was later a point of scrutiny when his Agent, Ron Salcer, stipulated that Wild staff had misdiagnosed his symptoms for 6-weeks with sinusitis, putting Burns at an increased health risk. Burns then had shoulder surgery upon the completion of the Wild season. He finished the injury-marred season with 27 points.
Burns suffered another concussion briefly into his 2009–10 season and started to skate again on January 14. He finished another injury-filled season with 20 points in 47 games.
On November 12, 2010, Burns was suspended 2 games for hitting Florida Panthers forward Steve Bernier. Burns hit Bernier on the chin with the knob of the stick, causing Bernier to bleed profusely.
During the 2011 NHL Entry Draft Burns along with a second round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft was traded to the Sharks in exchange for Devin Setoguchi, Charlie Coyle and a first round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. With a year still left in his contract with the Wild, Burns signed a 5-year contract extension on August 1, 2011 with the Sharks - the deal would pay him $28.8M over 5 years, with an average salary cap hit of $5.76M. In 2013, after rookie defenseman Matt Irwin's acquisition by the Sharks, in March, Burns was moved to forward, and scored 20 points in 23 regular season games. In the 2013-14 season, Burns played the first eight games, but missed 13 games since October 21 due to sore gums. On November 21, Burns returned to the Sharks and scored a goal against the Tampa Bay Lightning, as the Sharks won the game 5-1. On November 29 against the St. Louis Blues, Burns recorded his first career hat trick in a 6-3 victory.
International play.
Burns was named the best defenseman at the 2008 World Championships as he helped Team Canada to a silver medal finish as the host country. He was also part of the Summer Camp Roster for Team Canada in the 2010 Winter Olympics, but did not make the final roster cut. Two years later at the 2010 World Championships, Burns led all Canadian defencemen in ice time at 18:29 minutes a game as Canada finished in seventh place.
Personal life.
Off the ice, Burns spends his summers in Barrie, Ontario and Lake Elmo, Minnesota, and is a noted animal enthusiast and strong social liberal. His suburban Saint Paul home is nicknamed "Burns Zoo", due to his collection of dogs, cats, and dozens of reptiles, mainly snakes. Burns Zoo was subject of a CBC Hockey Night in Canada feature with Elliotte Friedman and on After Hours. In July 2009, Burns married his longtime girlfriend Susan Holder. The couple welcomed their first child, a 7-pound, 11-ounce girl named Peyton Gabriann on March 31, 2010; On June 23, 2011, the couple welcomed their second child, a son named Jagger Stephen Patrick. Starting in the 2009 season, Burns purchased a suite at the Xcel Energy Center for members of the military and their families to attend Wild home games.

1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts

The Venezuelan coup attempts of 1992 were attempts to seize control of the government of Venezuela by the Hugo Chávez-led Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200. The first coup attempt took place on February 4, 1992, and was led by Chávez. A second coup attempt on November 27, 1992, took place while Chávez was in prison but was directed by a group of young military officers who were loyal to the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200. 
The coups were directed against President Carlos Andrés Pérez and occurred in a period marked by neo-liberal economic reforms, which were attempted in order to decrease the country's level of indebtedness and had caused major protests and labour unrest. Despite their failure to depose the government of Carlos Andrés, the February coup attempts brought Chávez into the national spotlight.
Fighting during the coups resulted in the deaths of at least 143 people and perhaps as many as several hundred.
February 1992 coup attempt.
Background.
Venezuela had enjoyed democratic stability since 1958, and also a degree of prosperity. This prosperity was greatly enhanced in the 1970s, when oil prices increased substantially, and Venezuela, a large petroleum exporter, received large revenues, which increased per capita income by about 40%. However, in the 1980s, other oil producers (especially Saudi Arabia) raised their production, and oil prices dropped. Venezuela's oil revenues dropped substantially, and per capita income declined by about 25%. This imperiled economic and social stability in general. In particular, the government of Venezuela had continued its spending on social welfare programs and subsidies for commodities and public services at the same levels (also subsidies for favored industries). This resulted in large government deficits, which were funded by foreign borrowing, leading to high and potentially unsustainable foreign debts.
The IMF offered assistance to Venezuela with these debts, but on condition of Venezuela enacting budgetary and fiscal reforms to curtail the deficits. In 1989, President Pérez put these neoliberal policies into effect, reducing social spending and many commodity subsidies, and removing longstanding price controls on many goods. These policies bore heavily on Venezuela's working class and lower class majority. The resultant discontent erupted in the "Caracazo" riots of 27 February 1989.
Ideological origins.
Many of the participants in the coups had been members of the "Partido de la Revolución Venezolana" (PRV) in the 1970s. The PRV was created by ex-Communist and sometime guerrilla fighter Douglas Bravo, who after failing in an armed insurrection, sought to infiltrate the Venezuelan armed forces to reach power. Thus, preparation for the coup began more than ten years before Pérez was re-elected in 1988.
The coup organizers rejected the dominant political consensus of Venezuela, known as "puntofijismo", which had been established in 1958. Under "puntofijismo", political power was held by two political parties, Democratic Action and COPEI, which they saw as the two arms of a corrupt, clientelist establishment.
MBR-200.
The "Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario 200" (MBR-200) was founded by lieutenant colonel Hugo Chávez Frías, who was later joined by Francisco Arias Cárdenas. They used the Venezuelan revolutionary hero Simón Bolívar as their group's symbol. Their main complaint was the corruption of Carlos Andrés Pérez as well as Venezuela's ongoing economic difficulties and social turmoil. In the view of these two men, the entire political system had to be changed in order for social change to occur.
Coup unfolds.
After an extended period of popular dissatisfaction and economic decline under the neoliberal administration of Carlos Andrés Pérez, Chávez made extensive preparations for a military-civilian coup d'état. Initially planned for December 1991, Chávez delayed the MBR-200 coup until the early twilight hours of February 4, 1992. On that date, five army units under Chávez's command moved into urban Caracas to seize key military and communications installations throughout the city, including the presidential residence (Miraflores Palace), the defense ministry, La Carlota military airport, and the Military Museum. Chávez's ultimate goal was to intercept and take custody of Pérez before he returned to Miraflores from an overseas trip.
Chávez held the loyalty of some 10% of Venezuela's military forces. Betrayals, defections, errors, and other unforeseen circumstances soon left Chávez and a small group of rebels completely cut off in the Military Museum, without any means of conveying orders to their collaborators. Worse, Chávez's allies were unable to broadcast Chávez's pre-recorded call for a mass civilian uprising against Pérez. As the coup unfolded, 3 of Pérez's bodyguards were killed while Pérez hid under an overcoat and eluded capture. Pérez then called General Ochoa saying, "No negotiations. Give them bullets. I want to be back in soon". Fourteen soldiers were killed, and 50 soldiers and some 80 civilians injured, in the ensuing violence. Nevertheless, rebel forces in other parts of Venezuela made swift advances and took control of such large cities as Valencia, Maracaibo, and Maracay with the help of spontaneous civilian aid. Chávez's forces, however, had failed to take Caracas since he remained inside the Military Museum.
Chávez soon gave himself up to the government. He was then allowed to appear on national television to call for all remaining rebel detachments in Venezuela to cease hostilities. When he did so, Chávez famously quipped on national television that he had only failed ""por ahora"" ("for now"):
Chávez was immediately catapulted into the national spotlight, with many poor Venezuelans seeing him as a figure who had stood up against government corruption and kleptocracy. Afterward, Chávez was sent to Yare prison. President Pérez was impeached a year later.
November 1992 coup attempt.
On November 27, 1992, a second coup attempt was launched. It was led by officers from the air force and navy, including pilot . The group had contacts with Chávez in prison and had learned some lessons from the February coup's errors, including launching at 4:30 am instead of midnight, and obtaining communications equipment to ensure they would not be stranded without it.
In a bloody battle, they took over "Venezolana de Televisión", a state-run TV station, and broadcast a video made in prison by Chávez, calling for a popular uprising. But the rebels failed to take over other broadcast outlets such as Televen, allowing Pérez to address the nation and declare that the rebellion had failed.
The rebels also seized control of major air bases and largely gained control of the skies. However, by 9:00 am, it was clear that there was little other success for the rebels. After a minor pilot defection enabled government forces to shoot down a rebel plane, the rebels bombed some targets. They strafed the Caracas headquarters of DISIP (the political police) and bombed Miraflores.
Mirage fighter jets in rebel hands bombed an army barracks west of Caracas; however, the attack had little effect on slowing down the government counterattack. Around the same time, an F-16 pilot loyal to the government managed to engage and shoot down an AT-27.
An attempt to free Chávez and his associates from jail failed, and government forces retook most military bases. At about 3:00 pm, the remaining rebels took off for Peru in two C-130s, although they made it only as far as Iquitos. In total, the November death toll reached 172, much higher than the February attempt.
Government response.
In the process of resisting the coup attempts, government agents were reported to have killed 40 people, both civilians and surrendered rebels, either as extrajudicial executions or with disproportionate force. Arbitrary detentions numbered in the hundreds, continued for some time after the events, and included student leaders and other civic leaders not connected with the coup attempts. In addition, freedom of expression was suspended for two months in the February case and three weeks in the November case, with censorship of the media. A series of demonstrations in March/April calling for the resignation of President Pérez and the restoration of constitutional guarantees were met with state violence, including indiscriminate police firing into crowds, with a total of thirteen deaths. A number of members of the press covering the protests were severely injured by police.
Participants in the February coup attempt were tried under the regular military justice system. But in response to the November coup attempt, the government created "ad hoc" courts based on the 1938 legal code of Eleazar López Contreras, drawn up twenty years before the transition to democracy. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled the courts unconstitutional but not on the due process grounds for which they were criticised. The Court instead found that the President had neglected to suspend the relevant constitutional rights (right to a defense, right to be tried by one's natural judge).
Aftermath.
With Pérez's public image discredited by the unsuccessful neoliberal reforms and shattered by the coup attempts, other politicians began to challenge his authority, endangering the decades-old two-party "puntofijismo" system. The turmoil and failed coups were utilized by former president Rafael Caldera to comment on the gradual deterioration of Venezuelan democracy and the explosive conflation of poverty and corruption in the nation. Subsequent actions by intellectuals associated with Caldera resulted in Pérez's ousting from the presidency on May 20, 1993, on charges of corruption. Swift political maneuvering allowed Caldera to win the 1993 presidential election with a heterogeneous and non-traditional group of small independent political parties, named "National Convergence". As part of his campaign Caldera promised to pardon the coup plotters and later did so, which allowed Hugo Chávez to participate in (and win) the 1998 presidential election.

Eric Cairns

Eric Cairns (born June 27, 1974) is a Canadian retired ice hockey defenceman and current pro scout for the New York Islanders. His last season (2006) was with the Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL. Eric is still being featured in EA Sports' yearly NHL hockey game; he was featured in NHL 10 despite being retired for a number of years.
Playing career.
Drafted in the third round of the 1992 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers. He began his second year of professional hockey with the Charlotte Checkers in the ECHL where he played 14 games before the Rangers promoted him to the Binghamton Rangers of the AHL. A year later was playing in the NHL with the New York Rangers, where he spent several seasons before being placed on waivers. The Rangers' crosstown rivals, the New York Islanders, claimed Cairns on December 22, 1998. He played six seasons with the team before they declined to renew his contract. After the 2004–05 NHL lockout the Florida Panthers signed him as a free agent. Cairns was then traded to the Penguins mid-season. He missed most of the 2006–2007 season with post-concussion syndrome and various other injuries.
Cairns, an enforcer, received less playing time in his last year of play as the enforcer role is less prominent in the post-lockout NHL. Since entering the league in the 1996–1997 season with the Rangers, Cairns accumulated 1,117 penalty minutes, 10 goals, and 32 assists.
Islanders-Rangers rivalry.
During his tenure with the Islanders, Cairns was actively involved in the team's rivalry with the Rangers, particularly feuding with Theo Fleury, Sandy McCarthy, Matthew Barnaby and Dale Purinton. In a game on November 8, 2001, McCarthy challenged Cairns to a fight; initially, Cairns declined, but he later chased McCarthy down the ice into the Islanders' zone. During this time, McCarthy scored on a rebound. As McCarthy celebrated, Cairns gave him a jab to the jaw, which led to a fight between Cairns and Steve McKenna. Afterward, with Cairns in the penalty box, Fleury mocked him by flapping his arms like a chicken to suggest that Cairns was afraid to fight McCarthy, who flexed his biceps and looked at Cairns. In the next game between the two teams, on December 21, Cairns and McCarthy fought at the beginning of the first period following an early Islanders goal. Cairns won the fight, and McCarthy said of him after the game, "I never said he wasn't a tough guy."
In another incident on February 19, 2004, Dale Purinton sucker-punched Cairns in the face and continued to punch him after he was down on the ice. The rest of the game included a number of fights. Cairns called Purinton "gutless" and suggested that he violated the "code" of hockey enforcers by delivering the sucker punch. A week later, on February 26, the Islanders and Rangers again faced off. Cairns and Purinton came together, and Cairns began to throw punches, but Purinton dropped to the ice and turtled. Cairns let Purinton get up and challenged him, but Purinton refused to fight. Barry Melrose criticized Purinton for declining the chance to fight Cairns in a fair match.
London Racers incident.
During the lockout, Cairns played on the London Racers. On March 23, 2005, he was involved in a notorious fight with Wade Belak (playing for Coventry Blaze), during which, he punched the referee. The incident began shortly after a whistle when Belak & Cairns made contact behind the net. Cairns was called for a penalty and immediately lost it and tried to get his revenge on Belak and the other officials. The referee was holding him when Cairns threw a punch with his left hand to free himself. He skated around the rink for about a minute, unable to lose his teammates who were following right next to him to make sure he did not escalate the incident anymore. Finally, he raced to the Coventry bench where he threw a punch which finally dragged Belak back onto the ice for a "proper" fight. He was suspended for the remainder of the season, although the NHL allowed him to return the following year.
Pittsburgh Penguins.
Cairns was acquired from Florida Panthers in January 2006 to strength the Pen's defence and protect Sidney Crosby. Amazingly, Cairns started with a goal against the New York Islanders.
Post playing career.
Cairns is now a professional scout for the Islanders.

Kyle Charles Calder (born January 5, 1979) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who currently plays for the Bakersfield Condors of the ECHL. He previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Chicago Blackhawks, Philadelphia Flyers, Detroit Red Wings, Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks.
Playing career.
Calder began his career by playing junior hockey for the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League (WHL). After scoring 59 points in his sophomore season, he was drafted in the fifth round of the 1997 draft by the Chicago Blackhawks. After his fourth season where he scored 88 points between two teams, he was rewarded with his first professional contract.
Calder began his career by playing for the Cleveland Lumberjacks, the Blackhawks' International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate. He also came up to play in the NHL for the first time that season, playing in eight games. During that time, he also got his first NHL goal.
The following year, after the collapse of the IHL, Calder began and ended his season with the Norfolk Admirals, their new American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. For a good portion of the season he played for the Blackhawks, appearing in over forty games.
Starting in the 2001–02 NHL season, Calder stayed in the NHL. During the lockout, he spent a brief time in Sweden. He came back to the NHL stronger than ever that season. He led the Blackhawks in goals, assists, and points. 
On August 2, 2006, Calder was awarded a $2.9 million contract for the 2006–07 season by an arbitrator. The Blackhawks decided to accept it, and then on August 4, 2006, Calder was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Michal Handzus. At the trade deadline, the Flyers sent him back to Chicago for a third-round draft pick and Lasse Kukkonen. Chicago immediately sent him to the Detroit Red Wings for Jason Williams. Calder scored his first goal as a Red Wing during his first shift. He signed a two-year contract with the Los Angeles Kings on July 2, 2007.
On September 4, 2009, Calder was invited to the Anaheim Ducks training camp for the 2009–10 season. The Ducks however released him on September 26, less than a week before the start of the season. However, he would return to the Ducks organization on October 28 when they signed Calder to a one-year, two-way contract and assigned him to their ECHL affiliate the Bakersfield Condors. On November 14, he was recalled by Anaheim because of injuries to Saku Koivu and Ryan Carter. On December 28, 2009, Calder was waived by the Anaheim Ducks. After clearing waivers, he was assigned to the Toronto Marlies on December 30, 2009.

Sébastien Caron (born June 25, 1980, in Amqui, Quebec) is a professional ice hockey goaltender who currently plays for the Hamburg Freezers in the "Deutsche Eishockey Liga" (German Ice Hockey League). He previously played for the Iserlohn Roosters.
Biography.
Caron was a fourth-round pick in 1999 and is a butterfly goaltender best known for his great save from Brian Savage against the Philadelphia Flyers. This save came early in the 2005–06 season with his former team, the Pittsburgh Penguins. The puck went off the left goal post. Savage then tried to tip the puck in the goal but Caron quickly scooped the puck up with his glove almost on the goal line. Caron was also known for allowing a 170-foot shot by Washington Capitals defenseman Ivan Majeský. He started the season as backup to Jocelyn Thibault and ended it as back-up to Marc-André Fleury.
During the 2007 playoffs, Caron served as a spare goaltender for the Anaheim Ducks. He was not called on to dress during the playoffs. Caron was included on the Stanley Cup winning picture, and has a Stanley Cup ring; however, because he only played one regular season game, he did not qualify to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup. On April 1, 2010, Caron was signed by the Philadelphia Flyers. He was the seventh goaltender acquired the Flyers' for the 2009–10 NHL season. Caron was never in net for Philadelphia during his short visit.
On August 23, 2010, Caron was signed by Traktor Chelyabinsk. He also played for HC Lugano of Swiss National League A, and the Iserlohn Roosters in Germany.
On March 19, 2012, he signed with the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League. 
On June 15, 2012, Caron was traded along with two second-round draft picks in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft and a third-round draft pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft to the Nashville Predators for goalie Anders Lindbäck, Kyle Wilson, and a seventh-round draft pick.

<doc id="2851571" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851571" title="Irinotecan">
Irinotecan

Irinotecan (Camptosar, Pfizer; Campto, Yakult Honsha) is a drug used for the treatment of cancer.
Irinotecan prevents DNA from unwinding by inhibition of topoisomerase 1. In chemical terms, it is a semisynthetic analogue of the natural alkaloid camptothecin.
Its main use is in colon cancer, in particular, in combination with other chemotherapy agents. This includes the regimen FOLFIRI, which consists of infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan.
Irinotecan received accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996 and full approval in 1998. During development, it was known as CPT-11.
Mechanism.
Irinotecan is activated by hydrolysis to SN-38, an inhibitor of topoisomerase I. This is then inactivated by glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). The inhibition of topoisomerase I by the active metabolite SN-38 eventually leads to inhibition of both DNA replication and transcription.
Side-effects.
The most significant adverse effects of irinotecan are severe diarrhea and extreme suppression of the immune system.
Diarrhea.
Irinotecan-associated diarrhea is severe and clinically significant, sometimes leading to severe dehydration requiring hospitalization or intensive care unit admission. This side-effect is managed with the aggressive use of antidiarrheals such as loperamide or Lomotil with the first loose bowel movement.
Immunosuppression.
The immune system is adversely impacted by irinotecan. This is reflected in dramatically lowered white blood cell counts in the blood, in particular the neutrophils. The patient may experience a period of neutropenia (a clinically significant decrease of neutrophils in the blood) while the bone marrow increases white cell production to compensate.
Pharmacogenomics.
Irinotecan is converted by an enzyme into its active metabolite SN-38, which is in turn inactivated by the enzyme UGT1A1 by glucuronidation.
*28 variant patients.
People with variants of the UGT1A1 called TA7, also known as the "*28 variant", express fewer UGT1A1 enzymes in their liver and often suffer from Gilbert's syndrome. During chemotherapy, they effectively receive a larger than expected dose because their bodies are not able to clear irinotecan as fast as others. In studies this corresponds to higher incidences of severe neutropenia and diarrhea.
In 2004, a clinical study was performed that both validated prospectively the association of the *28 variant with greater toxicity and the ability of genetic testing in predicting that toxicity before chemotherapy administration.
In 2005, the FDA made changes to the labeling of irinotecan to add pharmacogenomics recommendations, such that irinotecan recipients with a homozygous (both of the two gene copies) polymorphism in UGT1A1 gene, to be specific, the *28 variant, should be considered for reduced drug doses. Irinotecan is one of the first widely used chemotherapy agents that is dosed according to the recipient's genotype.
Research.
Recently it was shown that antitumor activity of irinotecan against glioblastoma can be enhanced by statins.co-treatment.

Marc Chouinard (born May 6, 1977 in Charlesbourg, Quebec) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre-winger who most recently played for Kölner Haie. He has not formally announced his retirement, but has not played in over two and a half seasons.
Career.
Chouinard started his career in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in 1993. After two successful seasons, he was drafted in the second round, 32nd overall by the Winnipeg Jets during the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. He never played for the Jets, as was later traded to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. After three years with the team's American Hockey League affiliate, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, Chouinard was called up during the 2000–01 NHL season.
His success in the minors did not translate into NHL success, as his slow skating abilities hampered his scoring potential. He is used primarily as a checking line centre, used to kill off penalties and to shut down the opposing teams' top forwards. He has, however, had some success on the power play, as his large 6'5" frame is difficult for the opposing team's defenceman to move when placed in front of the net.

James Craik

James Craik (; 1730 – 6 February 1814) was Physician General (precursor of the Surgeon General) of the United States Army, as well as George Washington's personal physician and close friend.
Education and emigration to America.
Born on the estate of Arbigland in the parish of Kirkbean, County of Kirkcudbright, Scotland, Craik was the son of Robert Craik, a member of Parliament. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, then joined the British Army after graduation and served as an army surgeon in the West Indies until 1751. Craik then opened up a private medical practice in Norfolk, Virginia, and shortly thereafter relocated to Winchester, Virginia.
French and Indian War career.
On 7 March 1754, Craik resumed his military career, accepting a commission as a surgeon in Colonel Joshua Fry's Virginia Provincial Regiment. While with this force, he became good friends with George Washington, at that time a lieutenant colonel in the regiment. Craik saw a great deal of action in various battles of the French and Indian War. He fought at the Battle of the Great Meadows and participated in the surrender of Fort Necessity, then accompanied General Edward Braddock on Braddock's unsuccessful attempt to recapture the region in 1755, treating Braddock's ultimately fatal wounds. Craik then served under Washington in actions in Virginia and Maryland, during various engagements with Indians.
Inter War years.
After the war's end, Craik opened another medical practice at Port Tobacco, Maryland, and on 13 November 1760, he married Mariamne Ewell at her family's estate, Bel Air, located in Prince William County, Virginia. Marriamne would later become the great-aunt of Richard S. Ewell. They had six sons and three daughters. In 1760, he moved to Charles County, Maryland, where in 1765, he built La Grange near La Plata, Maryland. In both 1770 and 1784 he went on surveying expeditions with Washington, examining military claims in Pennsylvania and what is now West Virginia.
Revolutionary War career.
With the outbreak of hostilities during the American Revolution, Craik once more rejoined the army. He served as an army surgeon, ultimately advancing to the second-highest post in army medicine. Craik warned Washington about the plots of the Conway Cabal, and treated the wounds of General Hugh Mercer at the Battle of Princeton and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette at the Battle of Brandywine. Mercer died of his wounds, but La Fayette was more fortunate.
Washington persuaded him to move his practice to Alexandria, Virginia, where he built his house Vaucluse (plantation), where he died. He also had a town house at 117 South Fairfax Street, 209 Prince Street, and then 210 Duke Street.
Washington summoned Craik out of private practice in 1798 in connection with the Quasi-War against France, installing him as Physician General of the Army on 19 June of that year. After the conclusion of hostilities, Craik mustered out on 15 June 1800.
At Washington's death.
As Washington's personal physician, Craik was one of three doctors to attend on him during his final illness on 14 December 1799. Washington complained of respiratory distress, described by Craik as "cynanche trachealis". When Washington proved unable to swallow medicines orally, Craik and the other two physicians (Dr. Elisha C. Dick and Dr. Gustavus Richard Brown) treated his condition with bloodletting, the application of various poultices, and a rectal solution of calomel and tartar. Washington's condition continued to deteriorate, but Craik and Brown decided against Dick's suggestion of a tracheotomy (which might have been lifesaving, but likely would have spread the infection and caused sepsis), and Washington died at 10:10 p.m. Brown and Craik co-published an account of their treatment in December 1800.
Craik died in Alexandria in 1814; he is buried in the graveyard of the Old Presbyterian Meeting House in that city.

Erik Cole

Erik Thomas Cole (born November 6, 1978) is an American professional ice hockey player currently playing for the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played two stints with the Carolina Hurricanes as well as having played for the Montreal Canadiens and Edmonton Oilers.
Playing career.
Cole was first drafted by the Des Moines Buccaneers of the USHL after a family friend, Mark Pierce, out of West Des Moines, Iowa had multiple scouts take a look. He was then drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 3rd round as the 71st overall selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. In the 2001–2002 NHL season, his rookie year, Cole scored six goals during the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Additionally, he was one-third of the "BBC Line" featuring Bates Battaglia and Rod Brind'Amour during the Carolina Hurricanes’ Stanley Cup run in 2002. He is the first (and as of 2011, only) native of Oswego, NY in the NHL. Cole played college hockey for the Clarkson University Golden Knights. He played high school hockey for the Oswego Buccaneers in Oswego, NY.
On December 19, 2005, Cole was chosen to represent the United States as a player on Team USA's ice hockey team which competed in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. He was named along with fellow Clarkson University alum Craig Conroy, from the Calgary Flames. He also represented Team USA at the 2007 World Championships in Moscow, Russia.
On March 4, 2006, Cole suffered a fractured vertebra in his neck after getting hit by Pittsburgh Penguins's defenceman Brooks Orpik. The injury kept him out of the lineup until Game 6 of the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, where the Hurricanes won the Stanley Cup in Game 7. On November 12, 2007, Cole went head first into Florida Panthers goalie Tomas Vokoun, he was face down on the ice for over five minutes, and was escorted off the ice via stretcher. It was a neck injury but not serious, and he traveled with the team to Tampa Bay.
Cole was the first player in the NHL to ever be awarded two penalty shots in the same game. On July 1, 2008, Cole was acquired by the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Joni Pitkänen.
On January 14, 2009, Cole, as a member of the Edmonton Oilers, recorded his fifth hat trick against the Washington Capitals on goaltender José Théodore. Cole set an unofficial NHL record in the Fastest Skater event by skating around the entire Rexall Place with a time of 13.117 seconds.
On March 4, 2009, Cole was traded back to the Carolina Hurricanes for Patrick O'Sullivan and a second round draft pick. O'Sullivan was traded to Carolina for Justin Williams and second round pick earlier that day.
On July 1, 2009, the Hurricanes signed Cole to a two-year contract worth $5.8 million ($2.8 million in 2009-10 and $3 million in 2010-11).
On December 5, 2009, Cole scored his 6th career hat-trick against the Vancouver Canucks in Raleigh. The second goal went off the skate of former Clarkson University teammate Willie Mitchell. He scored the third goal on an empty-net after Canucks back-up Andrew Raycroft was pulled for an extra attacker in the last minute of play.
On July 1, 2011, Cole signed a four-year contract worth $18 million with the Montreal Canadiens. Cole wore jersey number 72 for the Canadiens. During his first season with the Canadiens in 2011–12, Cole set career highs with 35 goals and 61 points. On March 23, 2012 Cole scored a natural hat trick just 5:41 into a game against the Ottawa Senators, setting a Canadiens record for the quickest hat trick from the start of a game.
During the lockout shortened 2012–13 season, after exhibiting a slow start offensively he was traded by the Canadiens to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Michael Ryder and a third round pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft on February 26, 2013. In 28 games with Dallas, Cole would record six goals and an assist as the Stars missed the playoffs.

Jeff Cowan

Jeff Cowan (born September 27, 1976) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who is currently a left winger playing for the Iserlohn Roosters of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga.
Playing career.
After coming out of junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League, Cowan was not drafted in the NHL Entry Draft; he was signed by the Calgary Flames on 2 October 1995. He would play for the Flames' minor league affiliates (the Roanoke Express of the ECHL and the Saint John Flames of the AHL) for the next few years, before making Calgary's roster in the 1999–2000 NHL season. He would play for the Flames for two seasons before being traded with Kurtis Foster to the Atlanta Thrashers for Petr Buzek on 18 December 2001. 
In 2003–04, his third season with the Thrashers, Cowan was enjoying a career year, scoring 9 goals and 24 points through 58 games. However, he was once again traded on 9 March 2004, to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Kip Brennan. He finished the season with a career-high 11 goals, 16 assists and 27 points.
On 30 December 2006, the Kings placed Cowan on waivers and was subsequently claimed by the Vancouver Canucks. Towards the end of his first season with Vancouver, Cowan rose to brief prominence, scoring an unexpected 6 goals in 4 games. During that span, a bra was thrown on the ice after his second goal of the game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, coining the moniker "Cowan the Bra-barian". The unique celebration was popularized among fans and in response, the entire Canucks team signed a bra that was auctioned to raise money for breast cancer research.
As the Canucks entered the playoffs as the third seed, Cowan scored the first playoff goal of his NHL career in game one of the second round against the Anaheim Ducks. The following game, he scored the game-winning overtime goal to tie the series 1-1. Vancouver was, however, defeated in five games by Anaheim.
Before the start of the 2007–08 season, Cowan was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year, $1.45-million contract extension. However, Cowan failed to build on the momentum he had drawn the previous campaign. He was injured early in the season, suffering a strained hip flexor on October 13, 2007, following a fight with the Oilers' Zack Stortini. Shortly after he returned, he was re-injured in a December 9 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, separating his shoulder on a hit from enforcer Georges Laraque. Cowan finished the season with just 1 assist in 46 games. Shortly before the 2008–09 season, he was put on waivers and cleared. Instead of being assigned to the Canucks' AHL affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, he was sent to the Peoria Rivermen as the Moose had already met their five NHL veteran maximum.
On April 30, 2009 Cowan was recalled from Peoria for the Canucks' 2009 playoff run.
On August 20, 2009, Cowan signed a one-year contract with the Buffalo Sabres.
On December 17, 2010, The Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (Toronto Maple Leafs affiliate) signed Jeff Cowan to a professional try-out contract.
On August 12, 2011, Cowan signed a one-year contract to play with the Iserlohn Roosters of the DEL.

The Millionaire Next Door

"The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy" (ISBN 0-671-01520-6) is a 1996 book by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko.
This book is a compilation of research done by the two authors in the profiles of 'millionaires'. In this case they used the term 'millionaire' to denote U.S. households with net-worths exceeding one million dollars (USD).
The authors compare the behaviour of those they call "UAWs (Under Accumulators of Wealth)" and those who are "PAWs (Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth)".
UAWs versus PAWs.
Under Accumulator of Wealth (UAW) is a name coined by the authors used to represent individuals who have a low net wealth compared to their income. A $250,000 per year doctor is an "Under Accumulator of Wealth" if his/her net worth is less than the product of their age and one tenth of his/her realized pretax income. Take for example a 50-year-old doctor earning $250,000, according to the formula she should have (50*250,000*10%) or about $1.25 million in net worth. If her net worth is lower, she is an "Under Accumulator". The UAW style is based more on consumption of income rather than on the method of saving income. Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAW) is the reciprocal of the more common UAW, accumulating usually well over the product of the individual’s age and one tenth of his/her realized pretax income and are usually considered to be millionaires; however, not all are.
The authors define an Average Accumulator of Wealth (AAW) as having a net worth equal to one-tenth their age multiplied by their current annual income from all sources. E.g., a 50-year-old person who over the past twelve months earned employment income of $45,000 and investment income of $5,000 should have an expected net worth of $250,000. An "Under Accumulator of Wealth (UAW)" would have half that amount, and a "Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth (PAW)" would have two times. This metric has been criticized since, for example, a 20-year-old making $50k a year should have a net worth of $100k to be considered an "average accumulator of wealth". That makes little sense since it would take a new graduate years of strong savings and investments to accumulate that amount. The formula fails to take into account compounding interest; younger people up to age 45 or so will generally have much less as a percentage of income than older wealth accumulators due to compounded growth.
Most of the millionaire households that they profiled did not have the extravagant lifestyles that most people would assume. This finding is backed up by surveys indicating how little these millionaire households have spent on such things as cars, watches, suits, and other luxury products/services. Most importantly, the book gives a list of reasons for why these people managed to accumulate so much wealth (the top one being that "They live "below" their means"). The authors make a distinction between the 'Balance Sheet Affluent' (those with actual wealth, or high net-worth) and the 'Income Affluent' (those with a high income, but little actual wealth, or low net-worth).
Main points.
Spend less than you earn.
Anyone who spends more than they earn will fail to increase their net worth. "Most of our wives are planners and meticulous budgeters... Most of us will tell you that our wives are a lot more conservative with money than we are. (p.10)"
Avoid buying status objects or leading a status lifestyle.
Buying or leasing brand-new, expensive imported vehicles is poor value. 
Buying status objects such as branded consumer goods is a never-ending cycle of depreciating assets. Even when you get a good deal on premium items, if you choose to replace them frequently, the older items hold no value and have become a sunk cost.
Living in a status neighbourhood is not only poor value, but you will feel the need to keep buying status objects to keep up with your neighbours, who are mostly UAWs. 
The authors make the point that Hyperconsumers must realize more income to afford luxury items and become more vulnerable to inflation and income tax.
PAWs are willing to take financial risk if it is worth the reward.
PAWs are not misers who put every penny under their mattress. They invest their money for good returns, and will consider riskier investments if they're worth the reward. Many put money not only in the stock market, but invest in private businesses and venture capital. They do not gamble or speculate on long-odds stocks.
Economic outpatient care.
The authors also make the observation that UAWs tend to have children who require an influx of their parents' money in order to afford the lifestyle that they expect for themselves, and that they are less likely to have been taught about money, budgeting and investing by their parents.
The authors talked about the seven most common ways that showed up among those that have accumulated wealth. Those common ways are the following; high income, low income, frugal, wealthy, breaking even (Spartan), spender, broke, and breaking even (Lavish).
Spending tomorrow's cash today.
The most prominent idea shared by UAWs and American society in general is "spending tomorrow's cash today". This is the leading cause of debt and a lack of net worth in the UAW category. This contradicts the common belief of a PAW: "save today's cash for tomorrow". Many UAWs do plan, under certain conditions (such as a rise in income), to use investment strategies to accumulate wealth; however, most don't actually use investment strategies to accumulate wealth once the initial conditions are met. For example, Under Accumulators of Wealth will promise to start investing once they have earned ten percent more in annual income. Unfortunately when most receive that extra ten percent of income, there isn't an investment made. These claims and ideas usually branch off an initial belief that a lack of wealth can simply be solved by an increase in income. Even among those that do invest money, most invest only because they have an excess of income. Between 2001 and 2004, the median family income dropped 2.3% and in response, the percentage of families who owned investment stocks fell by 3.3% showing that investments are only made in times of excess.
"Better Than" theory.
The "Better Than" theory is one of the main reasons many UAWs don't hold true to their promise to invest after a rise in income. The theory is that the UAW's "necessity" for that income will also rise in response to the risen income level. Most UAWs are possessed by possessions. According to a study conducted by Yale and stated in "The Millionaire Next Door", individuals measure the level of their success through comparison to nearest neighbors and/or closest relatives. Therefore, as the level of income rises, so will their desire to outperform those that they compare themselves to.
"Better Off" theory.
In addition to the "Better Than" theory, there is a "Better Off" theory. This theory suggests that those UAWs who grow up in a poor family and land a high-income career have a tendency to feel the need to be "better off" than their parents. To a UAW, "better off" implies a larger house, a respectable degree, a foreign luxury car, a boat, and a club membership. A hypothetical example is provided in "The Millionaire Next Door" to explain this concept. Teddy Friend is a typical UAW that grew up in a poor family but was still exposed to a rich lifestyle at school. He saw "rich kids" and decided that one day he would be "better off" than his poor parents. Sure enough, when Mr. Friend reached a high income level, he indulged himself in possessions. He bought a large home along with a foreign luxury car. According to most UAWs, he lives a very comfortable lifestyle. He lives a very comfortable lifestyle in terms of possessions, but in terms of financial security, Mr. Friend's lifestyle is uncomfortable.
Money: a renewable resource.
Another belief that UAWs have is that "money is the most easily renewable resource". This belief usually is another leading cause for UAW's consumption and investment habits. Money is more easily spent now than it is saved. In America it is easier to generate a high income than it is to accumulate wealth.
Spending habits.
When it comes to spending habits, UAWs are everything but frugal. A typical UAW tends to live in luxury, style, and above all, comfort. Not all UAWs fit these characteristics. A $50,000-a-year janitor can be more of a PAW than a $700,000-a-year doctor. The spending habits that UAWs have are a direct effect of the “Better Than” theory.
Million dollar choices.
Some of the financial choices that UAWs make are considered to be “million dollar choices” because if the choice hadn’t been made, the UAW would have in excess of a million dollars. One example of a million dollar choice is to smoke. Smokers and alcoholics tend to be UAWs because instead of building net worth, they spend their income to purchase alcohol or cigarettes. Another hypothetical example given in "The Millionaire Next Door" explains how a small purchase of cigarettes over a long period of time can accumulate a large sum of money. Mr. Friend’s poor parents were smokers and drinkers. They smoked at least three packs of cigarettes a day during the week. Three packs a day over 46 years translated into a sum of money that exceeded the value of their home by $33,000. Even more extraordinary, if the Friends had invested and reinvested that money over a 46-year period, the portfolio would have exceeded $2 million. The value of a small amount of money over a long period of time is amazing. A UAW makes choices that, although financially insignificant at the present value, have a very significant future value. Choices such as drinking two cases of beer a week, smoking several packs of cigarettes a day, and buying large amounts of unnecessary food and objects are some examples of typical UAW choices. These choices are not necessarily large financial purchases right now, but over a long period of time, the opportunity cost of that money is very expensive.
Car shopping habits.
According to the authors, a common UAW drives a current model car, purchased new, and may have financed it on credit. PAWs rarely purchase new model cars and are less likely to own foreign or luxury vehicles. An example from the book details a UAW that spent roughly 60 hours researching, negotiating and purchasing a new car. In the end, while the car was purchased "near dealer cost," in the long run the UAW's time and money could have been more efficiently spent creating wealth rather than collecting possessions notorious for depreciating in value. The authors contrast the story with a PAW who decided that the pride of owning a brand new car wasn't worth the $20,000 price difference.
Investing strategies.
The difference between UAWs and PAWs is wealth. Wealth is usually obtained through investment strategies that maximize unrealized (nontaxable) income and minimizes realized (taxable) income. UAWs tend to spend more time on purchasing a car than on looking at appreciating investments. Appreciating investments such as a 401k or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) constitute tax-deferred growth and produce an unrealized income for the individual holder. Some UAWs do hold a 401k or an IRA but with a low portfolio value. UAWs usually have the belief that in order to comply with the “Better Than” or “Better Off” theories, they need to maximize realized income. Maximized realized income minimizes unrealized income, increases taxes paid, and produces low portfolio values. Certainly there are some UAWs that invest in the stock market and are very active traders, but most don’t. Active traders move from stock to stock to try to maximize capital gains on investments based on daily fluctuations of the stock market. This investment strategy is very risky, but has potential for some enormous capital gains. UAWs also are more prone to being swindled out of money from cold callers. Cold callers, usually brokers who in fact know very little about the stock market, target high income earning families and persuade them into purchasing investments with them. Doctors and lawyers are especially susceptible. A vulnerability to cold callers can subject individuals to lose trust in the stock market and eventually become a UAW. Then there are UAWs that have relatively low risk tolerance for investments. Twenty percent of UAWs keep most of their cash in cash/near cash accounts (investment accounts such as a bank accounts that have low interest rates, high liquidity, and are federally insured) so that they can have quick access to cash when consumption habits rise. Then there are some UAWs who have considerable knowledge of the specific market of a company or type of investment, but do not utilize that knowledge to their advantage. "The Millionaire Next Door" uses Mr. Willis as an example. He is a six-figure, very successful executive for Walmart. He has been employed there for 10 years, during which the company has been explosively growing. Stock prices have shot up in this 10-year period of time. During this enormous growth period, Mr. Willis bought zero shares of the company he worked for, although he had firsthand knowledge of its success. A characteristic that determines if the individual is a UAW is their belief about investing. A UAW will usually state the following about investing: “it’s hopeless,” or “I never have the time needed to make it pay off,” or “we have never made so much… but the more we earn, the less we seem to accumulate.” Other remarks might include, “Our careers take up all of our time,” or “I don’t have 20 hours a week to fool around with my money”. A UAW does not spend a considerable amount of time evaluating their investment strategies. On average, they’ll invest only 4.6 hours a month evaluating their investment portfolios. This is about 83% less than the amount of time a PAW allocates to financial planning. Minimal time dedicated to financial planning is a leading indicator of a UAW.
Educational and career choices.
Although UAWs exist in all career fields and have obtained different levels of education, some professions are more likely to lead to a UAW lifestyle. Doctors, physicians, lawyers, and dentists are among the top professions with a high UAW concentration of individuals. The individuals in these professions are twice as likely to be a UAW than a PAW. There are two reasons for these findings. First, because these professions require advanced degrees, individuals get a delayed start in the accumulation race. Most of the income during these educational pursuits is used to fund tuition, housing, and student loans rather than investment. The second reason is that American society has prescribed a lifestyle to these professions. Doctors are expected to live in an upscale neighborhood with multiple cars, a boat, and other luxury items. Their lives become a high consumption lifestyle to fulfill the “Better Than” theory.
Correlation between income and wealth.
With doctors having a high propensity to be a UAW as evidence, there is an indirect relationship between the level of income an individual earns and the net wealth that one accumulates. Doctors have a reasonably high level of income; therefore, it is more likely that doctors have relatively low amounts of net worth. The same holds true for those that have lower levels of income. They are more likely to accumulate more in relation to their level of income. Of course, there are those who are an exception to the rule on both sides of the spectrum. Mr. Friend’s parents were poor, but they lived a high consumption lifestyle leading them to be UAWs.
Children of UAWs.
When children are brought up in a high consumption, UAW lifestyle, they are more likely to become UAWs themselves. More often than not, the children of high income UAWs become more devout believers in the UAW system than their parents. The children grow accustomed to extreme luxury and believe that they too must possess the same luxury as their parents, even if their income is much less. It is an extreme manifestation of the “Better Off” theory. On the other hand, PAWs may also produce UAW offspring. If the Friends had invested the money they had been consuming, they would have been considered PAWs; however, the standard of living that their son, Mr. Friend, grew up in would have been diminished. Mr. Friend would have felt an even higher desire to be “better off” than his parents were. He may still have been a UAW regardless of whether his parents were UAWs or PAWs.
Economic Outpatient Care.
Economic Outpatient Care (EOC) is a term used to express when an affluent parent provides money to an adult child. Besides offspring observations resulting in UAW children, EOC is a contributing factor to the passing on of the UAW belief. Offspring who receive EOC have 98% of the annual income compared to their counterparts who are not recipients of EOC. In comparison, they also have 57% of the net worth. EOC gives recipients a false sense of financial security. For this reason they purchase homes in upscale neighborhoods that exceed the recommended value according to their incomes. Thirty percent of American families live in homes valued at $300,000, yet only earn an annual income of $60,000. These homes then demand nice cars for the driveway, nice furniture for the living room, and a nice plasma TV to complement the furniture. These offspring also purchase and consume the EOC rather than invest it. If a dose of EOC is given on a regular basis, the EOC can actually be absorbed into the individual’s perceived annual income. Expenditures are then calculated with the anticipation of a regularly scheduled dose of EOC.
America: the ultimate UAW.
The average American is a UAW, with an annual income of $32,000, a total net worth of $36,000, and a realized income value that is about 90% of their total net worth. The government draws the poverty line based on income, and society determines a family’s well-being based on their level of earned income. Income is a poor indicator of well-being. On the other hand, wealth is a good indicator of the financial independency or financial dependency of individuals. Unfortunately society has an almost unlimited number of ways to consume income and limited ways to save income; therefore, individuals are more prone to spend than save. That eventually results in an adoption of a UAW lifestyle.
Criticism.
Nassim Nicholas Taleb criticised the premise of the book on the basis of two instances of survivorship bias: that there is no mention of the accumulators who have accumulated underperforming assets, and that the United States had just gone through the greatest bull market in its history at the time of the book's publication. He suggested that the authors should lower the net worth of the observed millionaires to compensate for the effect of the unobserved losers, and to consider the fate of accumulators following prolonged periods of recession such as in 1982 or 1935.

Krul started his professional career at Newcastle United in 2006, having previously played for the team's youth academy, as well as ADO Den Haag and Hvv RAS youth teams. Initially third choice behind Shay Given and Steve Harper, he spent the 2007–08 season on loan to Falkirk, and the following season on loan to Carlisle United, making 26 and nine appearances respectively. Although he started the season as a backup goalkeeper to Harper, injuries to the latter during the 2010–11 season saw Krul break into the team, and he eventually became the number one. An ever-present in the Premier League during the following season, injuries restricted him to 24 league games for the 2012–13 season.
Krul represented the Netherlands at every level from the under-15s to the under-21s between 2002 and 2011. He made his debut for the full national team in July 2011, and played at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
Club career.
Newcastle United.
Krul began his career at hometown club RAS and later at local Eredivisie club ADO Den Haag. He joined Premier League club Newcastle United in the summer of 2005 on a three-year deal after failing to sign professional terms. ADO demanded a compensation fee and objected with the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC). The DRC denied the claim and ADO took the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS ruled in February 2007 in favor of ADO ordering Newcastle to pay €220,000 as compensation for the transfer.
He played in the Under-17 European Championship for the Netherlands in Italy in May 2005 and eventually made the step up to the Dutch under-21 squad. He made his first senior appearance for Newcastle in a pre-season defeat to PSV Eindhoven on 29 July 2006.
Following the injury to Newcastle's first-choice goalkeeper, Shay Given, Krul was on the bench for a few games as back-up to second-choice Steve Harper. Krul made his Newcastle debut in the UEFA Cup game on 2 November 2006, away to Palermo. His debut was hailed by critics as he displayed his shot-stopping abilities, saving efforts from Giuseppe Biava and David Di Michele and recording a clean sheet in the process.
He injured himself in the warm up prior to the second leg tie against Palermo and then aggravated that injury in the warm up before a game against Watford. He required two cartilage operations as a result, keeping him out of action for almost 6 months. He returned to action in April 2007.
On 13 June 2007, he signed a new four-year contract with Newcastle. In the same month, he was part of the Dutch Under-21 squad that won the European Championships and also qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics.
Falkirk.
On 3 August 2007, Krul joined Scottish side Falkirk on loan originally until 1 January 2008, though it was later extended until the end of the season after a number of impressive performances. Falkirk initially wanted to sign him on a permanent deal however it was refused by Newcastle The following day he made his debut for Falkirk and kept a clean sheet as the team won 4–0 against Gretna.
In the two games immediately following his debut, he conceded 4 goals against Celtic and 7 goals against Rangers at Ibrox. Krul was sent off for the first time in his professional career on 2 January 2008, after reacting badly to an opponent's challenge. Shortly afterwards he was injured, suffering a dislocated shoulder during a Scottish Cup defeat against Aberdeen, and resulting in him missing the rest of the season.
Carlisle United.
On 21 November 2008, Krul joined Carlisle United on a one month loan from Newcastle, to replace Ben Alnwick who had rejoined Tottenham Hotspur. The loan deal was extended for a further month in December with Krul returning to Newcastle in January.
Return to Newcastle.
Krul returned to Newcastle as the backup goalkeeper to first choice Steve Harper. He made his senior league debut on 8 August 2009 in the first Football League Championship game of the season away to West Bromwich Albion, coming on as a half time substitute for the injured Harper. Following this match, "The Guardian" called him "an excellent reserve goalkeeper". He later played the full Football League Cup match against Huddersfield Town, on 26 August 2009, in which Newcastle won 4–3. Krul also started the 2–0 league cup defeat to Peterborough, where despite being on the losing side he put on an impressive performance. Against Swansea City on 28 November he again came on to replace the injured Steve Harper at half time. On 2 January he played in the FA Cup Third Round tie against Plymouth Argyle, the game ending 0–0. He then played in the replay at St James' Park on 13 January and went on to win the match 3–0. Krul started his first league game for Newcastle on 2 May 2010 on the last day of the Championship campaign against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road and kept a clean sheet. In July 2010, Krul signed a new four-year contract with Newcastle.
Krul made his Premier League debut for Newcastle on 18 September 2010 against Everton at Goodison Park, coming on as a substitute in the 35th minute for the injured Steve Harper in a match that ended in a 1–0 win for The Magpies. He made his first Premier League start on 26 September against Stoke City at St James' Park. He continued playing against Manchester City in a 2–1 loss, Wigan Athletic in a 2–2 draw and in the 2–1 away win to West Ham United before starring in his first Tyne-Wear derby which Newcastle won 5–1 and in a 1–0 away win at Arsenal a week later, pulling off some good saves in the process.
Following his good performances, Alan Pardew gave him more chances in goal. He eventually became first choice and Harper was sent on loan to Brighton. He started the 2011–12 season well, keeping clean sheets in the first two matches of the season against Arsenal and Sunderland. On 3 December 2011, Krul made his 50th Newcastle appearance against Chelsea, he saved a Frank Lampard penalty and made several other impressive saves, however Newcastle still went on to lose the game 3–0. His performances have made him a clear favourite with the Newcastle United fans, his most recent achievement being a 15th clean sheet in a single season with a 2–0 over Chelsea on 2 May 2012. On 3 March 2012, Krul signed a new 5-year contract at Newcastle United. Krul then went on to play in the away game against Arsenal, which Newcastle lost 2–1. During the match, fellow Dutchman Robin van Persie accused Krul of wasting time throughout the match and taunted Krul after the match ended. The row continued until the tunnel and the two players had to be separated. Though receiving criticism from Arsenal's Jack Wilshire, Team-mate James Perch defended Krul, believing van Persie “out of order”. At the end of the season, Krul received Toon Talk’s Newcastle United player of the year award.
In the summer before the 2012–13 Premier League, Krul was given the number 1 shirt number, with Steve Harper receiving number 37. Krul was featured as starter goalkeeper for the three opening matches before suffering an elbow injury whilst in international duty. After seven week off, due to an elbow injury, Krul returned to training. Krul made his return in Tyne–Wear derby on 21 October 2012, which results in a 1-1 draw. His injury comeback furthermore when he suffered an ankle injury, which leave out for five weeks during a Europa League match in the Round of 32 against Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkiv. Upon his recovery from an ankle injury, Krul says he feared his [2012-13] season is coming to end. In the Tyne–Wear derby, on 14 April 2013, Krul suffered a dislocated shoulder in a 57th minutes after "landed awkwardly after punching away an Adam Johnson free-kick", which results a 3-0 loss. After surgery on his dislocated shoulder, Krul was ruled out for the entire 2012-13 season.
In 2013–14 season, Krul made his first appearance of the season since recovering from ankle injury in a friendly match against Rangers, which results a 1-1 draw. Since the opening game of the season, Krul became a regular starer as first choice goalkeeper. In November, Krul made impressive display, having conceded two goals in two games against Norwich City and West Brom, though having two clean sheets against Tottenham (in which he made a total of 14 saves during the match) and Chelsea. His impressive displays earned him November's Premier League Player of the Month. Krul's performance was praised by Newcastle United goalkeeper legend Pavel Srníček and Manager Alan Pardew
International career.
Krul represented the Netherlands national football team at U17 level at the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Peru. He represented the U21s at the 2008 Toulon Tournament and was a regular in the side for the 2011 European Under-21 Championship qualifying campaign. 
On 4 June 2011, Krul made the starting eleven for the Netherlands in a friendly against Brazil, his first cap at senior level. He went on to keep a clean sheet, pulling off a string of decent saves in a 0–0 draw. He played his second match for the international team four days later against Uruguay in a 3–4 penalty shoot-out loss, after the match finished 1–1 after 90 minutes. He was included in the Netherlands UEFA Euro 2012 squad, but did not make any appearances. In new coach Louis van Gaal's first competitive game in charge against Turkey in Amsterdam, Krul was selected as starting goalkeeper, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win for the "Oranje".
In June 2014, Krul was included in the Netherlands' squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. In the quarter-final against Costa Rica, he was brought on by Louis van Gaal as a 120th-minute substitute for the penalty shootout. He saved two of the five penalties he faced as the Netherlands won 4–3. That was the first time in the history of the World Cup that a goalkeeper was sent in as a substitution solely for penalty shootouts.
Personal life.
Krul lives together with his girlfriend and has a daughter.

USS Henley (DD-391)

USS "Henley" (DD-391), a "Bagley"-class destroyer, was the 2nd ship of the United States Navy to be named for Captain Robert Henley, an officer in the United States Navy during the Quasi-War with France, the War of 1812 and the Second Barbary War.
History.
The second "Henley" (DD-391) was launched 12 January 1937 by the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California; sponsored by Miss Beryl Henley Joslin, a collateral descendant of Captain Robert Henley; and commissioned 14 August 1937, Lieutenant Commander H. Y. McCown in command.
After shakedown in the Pacific and Hawaiian waters, "Henley" joined the Pacific Battle Force, Destroyer Division 11, at San Diego 12 September 1938. She departed San Diego 14 April 1941 to join the Fleet at Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941, "Henley" was moored in East Loch with battle stations manned, a green sailor having sounded General Quarters instead of Quarters for Muster. This fortunate mistake gave "Henley" under the command of Lieutenant Francis Edward Fleck, Jr., the opportunity to fire the first destroyer shots as the initial wave of enemy planes swooped in. A bomb exploded 150 yards off her port bow as she slipped her chain from the buoy, and, as she cleared, she received a signal that a submarine was in the harbor. "Henley" maneuvered through the smoke, fire, and confusion and sped out of the channel. Her gunners shot down one dive bomber with her .50 cal. guns and shared credit for another. Conned by Fleck—both her commanding officer and executive officer were ashore when the attack began—"Henley" dropped depth charges on a sonar contact, possibly a midget submarine, outside the harbor, and continued to blaze away at the enemy with her guns. In the following weeks "Henley" operated with the task forces to reinforce Wake Island and conducted patrol for the protection of Midway and convoy lanes.
"Henley" carried out convoy and antisubmarine duty, primarily in Australian waters. On 11 May 1942 she rescued the survivors of the USS Neosho and USS Sims, sunk during the Battle of the Coral Sea. She departed for Wellington 22 July 1942 to escort transports to Guadalcanal. As American forces stormed ashore in the Solomons 7 August, "Henley" patrolled on an ASW station, coming under fire from enemy planes but suffering no casualties and assisting in shooting down two in the process. As the fierce struggle for Guadalcanal raged, the destroyer remained in the area to screen ships bringing up supplies and reinforcements until 29 August. "Henley" then set course south, and remained in Australian and New Guinea waters until September 1943 on plane guard, convoy duty, and antisubmarine patrol.
Fate.
When Australian troops established a beachhead at Finschafen, New Guinea, 21 September 1943, "Henley" formed a part of their protective screen. Attacked by 10 Japanese torpedo bombers, she claimed to have shot down 3 and assisted in downing 3 others in a fierce half hour engagement. However, the valiant ship's wartime career, begun in the chaos at Pearl Harbor, was drawing to a close. On 3 October 1943 "Henley" was steaming with "Reid" and "Smith" on an offensive sweep off Finschafen when her skipper sighted two torpedoes fired by the submarine "Ro-108" heading for her. Split-second maneuvering permitted "Henley" to evade those two torpedoes; but a third was immediately sighted, closing too fast and too near to be avoided. "Henley" was struck on the port side, with the torpedo exploding in the number 1 fire-room, destroying her boilers, breaking her keel, and displacing her bow about 30 degrees from the longitudinal axis of the ship.
At 18:29, with all her crew having abandoned ship, "Henley" went down, stern first. Her companion DD's searched for the sub, then returned to rescue Henley's survivors, who had lashed their life-rafts together and were using flashlights as signals. Eighteen officers and 225 men were rescued, but 15 people (one of her officers and 14 of her crew members) did not survive the sinking.
Honors.
"Henley" earned four battle stars for her participation in World War II.

Hokuto Bank

History.
The forerunner to the Hokuto Bank was the Masuda Bank, established in Yokote, Akita Prefecture in 1895. Although the Masuda Bank merged with several other banks throughout the first half of the 1900s, it changed its name to its present form in 1993 when it merged with the Akita Akebo Bank. At the time of the merger, the name Komachi Bank was floated as a possible name, but was ultimately turned down in favor of the current form. The bank has gradually diversified its range of financial services, and began to offer insurance in 2002. In the early 2000s, the Hokuto Bank was involved numerous scandals, including embezzlement charges. This prompted the Japanese Financial Services Agency to request a plan to improve its governance. As a result, the Hokuto Bank has launched a series of initiatives, entitled "Believe" and, more recently, "Breakthrough", to improve its governance.

Earl Strom

Earl "Yogi" Strom (December 15, 1927 – July 10, 1994) was an American professional basketball referee for 29 years in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and for three years in the American Basketball Association (ABA). Strom is credited as one of the greatest referees in the history of the NBA and was known for his flamboyant style and ability to control the game. Nicknamed "The Pied Piper", the assertive Strom made foul calls with his whistle by using a "tweet-pause-tweet-tweet" tune and pointing at the offending player. In addition to calling fouls with flair, he was known for ejecting players from games with style and he sometimes supported his rulings with physical force.
Over the course of his career, he officiated 2,400 professional basketball regular season games, 295 playoff games, 7 All-Star games, and 29 NBA and ABA Finals. For his extensive contributions to the game, Strom was posthumously elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1995.
Early life.
Strom was born December 15, 1927 in Pottstown, Pennsylvania to Max and Bessie Strom. Earl's father, Max, was a foreman at a bakery, and Earl grew up in the household as the youngest of seven children comprising five boys and two girls. As a child, he became interested in athletics and competing in sports, and this interest lasted throughout his childhood and into high school. At Pottstown High School, Strom played football, baseball, and basketball. After finishing high school in 1945, he joined the United States Coast Guard towards the end of World War II. Returning from service, Strom attended Pierce Junior College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he graduated in 1951. Following school, the young Strom continued participating in sports and played for a local semi-professional basketball team in his early 20s. During a basketball game, he had an argument with a referee and the referee said "Look, you're not much of a player, and you've got a pretty good mouth on you, so why don't you think about taking up refereeing?" Following the advice of the referee, Strom decided to get into officiating. He officiated high school games for nine years as well as college games in the East Coast Athletic Conference for three years.
In 1952, he married Yvonne Trollinger, and the couple went on to have five children. Outside of officiating, Strom worked at General Electric in customer relations starting in 1956 and continued in this role through his first stint in the NBA. He felt this "day job" provided security to his family since officiating in the NBA did not at the time.
Professional basketball officiating career.
National Basketball Association (1957–1969).
Early years.
Strom became an NBA referee with the start of the 1957–58 NBA season after accepting an invitation to join the league from Jocko Collins, supervisor of officials. He further developed his skills in the league by learning from other officials such as Mendy Rudolph, Norm Drucker, and Sid Borgia. Strom ascended to the top of the officiating ladder by the end of his third season in the league as he was assigned playoff games, which was uncommon for lesser experienced referees at the time. The following year, Strom and Rudolph made NBA history when they officiated the 1961 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and St. Louis Hawks. This was the only time in NBA history that the same two officials worked an entire series, which was the result of the two teams not agreeing on any other officials to use in the series.
Six years into his NBA career, Strom had worked every playoff game in the semi-finals and finals along with Rudolph. In fact, the former was assigned to any seventh and deciding game in a series during this time. He was also involved in one of the most memorable moments in NBA history during the 1965 Eastern Conference finals between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. In the seventh and final game, the 76ers trailed the Celtics 110–109 with five seconds left. The 76ers had possession of the ball and attempted to inbound the pass as the Celtics' John Havlicek tipped the pass thrown by Hal Greer and preserved the Celtics victory. Celtics' radio announcer Johnny Most made his most fabled call: "Havlicek stole the ball! Havlicek stole the ball!" And all this while, Strom had officiated the game in a cast as he had broken his hand while punching a fan during an altercation at a game the previous night.
Memorable encounter with Wilt Chamberlain.
In another significant moment in his officiating career, Strom was saved from an angry mob by legendary center Wilt Chamberlain during a game played in Memphis, Tennessee in the mid-1960s. Strom had made a call that went against the St. Louis Hawks and at halftime was called a "gutless bastard" by Hawks general manager Irv Gack at the scorer's table. The fiery official asked Gack to repeat the comment as he reached across the table and grabbed Gack by the shirt. Fans started coming down from the seats while Chamberlain, playing for the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, saw what was going on. He stepped across the table, picked Strom up and said, "C'mon Earl. Let's get the hell out of here."
Controversies.
More controversies surrounded Strom when he was again involved in a historical NBA moment during the 1967 NBA All-Star Game. As one of the referees in the game, Strom was responsible for the ejection of Red Auerbach, head coach of the East All-Stars. Auerbach remains the only coach to be ejected in an All-Star Game. Nevertheless, Strom was subsequently designated crew chief in 1967 and 1968 when the league hired Dolph Schayes as supervisor of officials for the NBA. He was put in charge of scouting crews, rating referees, and developing the skills of lesser experienced referees as well as working a schedule of games.
Departure to the American Basketball Association.
After more than a decade's experience in the game, Strom was offered a salary contract over 82 games for $16,000 for the first time by Commissioner Walter Kennedy in August 1969. It was at this time that Strom became interested in listening to what the ABA, which started in 1967, had to offer in the bidding war that ensued between the two leagues over talent. The NBA did not offer benefit plans such as pension, family hospitalization, and long-term disability, which were of importance to Strom and his family. Lured by Borgia, who jumped from the NBA to the ABA to become supervisor of officials, Strom and three other officials—John Vanak, Norm Drucker, and Joe Gushue met with acting ABA Commissioner Jim Gardner during the summer of 1969. The ABA accepted Strom's demands of a $25,000 per year salary, a $25,000 signing bonus, and a health insurance and pension plan. As the four officials left for the ABA in 1969, it brought reform to NBA referees in terms of compensation and benefits. Regular officials in the NBA were offered contracts and salaries increased significantly. Additionally, medical and pension plans were provided for the officials.
American Basketball Association (1969–1972).
Differences between the leagues.
While Strom earned more than twice as much in the ABA than the NBA, he soon became disenchanted with the ABA for the lack of big name superstars and arenas that the NBA provided. Strom had anticipated that the ABA product would be inferior to the NBA, but assumed that the increase in pay would compensate for the level of play. However, he fed off the energy of the fans when officiating games and the small attendance sizes in the ABA made him feel depressed.
Controversies.
Controversy again did not elude Strom in the ABA. In a 1970 game between the Texas Chaparrals and Denver Rockets in Denver, Colorado, he was attacked by a fan who came onto the court after Strom confronted the fan who was using profanity. Strom threw two punches before police officers took the fan away. For his involvement in the incident, Strom was fined $250 by the league. Not long after, he was fined by the league again. Following an exhibition game that Strom officiated between the Virginia Squires and Kentucky Colonels, he told a Philadelphia reporter that he had just seen the greatest player alive, referring to Julius Erving. While Erving was a very influential player in his era, the president of the Colonels, Mike Storen, complained that Strom was promoting players. The league fined Strom $50, but he sent $100 to Commissioner Jack Dolph saying, "The first fifty dollars is for the fine and the second fifty dollars is because I'm tellin' ya' he "is" the greatest."
Departure from the American Basketball Association.
After the conclusion of his third season in the ABA, the dissatisfied Strom contacted NBA Commissioner Walter Kennedy to discuss returning to the NBA. Encouraged with the support of Wayne Embry and Pat Williams, general managers of the Milwaukee Bucks and Chicago Bulls respectively, Strom met with Kennedy during the 1972 ABA Playoffs. Kennedy informed Strom that John Nucatola, supervisor of officials, manages the staffing of officials, but Strom received a vote of confidence to come back to the NBA in the form of a handshake from the commissioner. Strom met with Nucatola and discussed salary and benefits. Strom was told by Nucatola that he would be getting a $25,000 salary and was guaranteed a job in the NBA for the start of the 1972–73 NBA season through a handshake agreement although no contract was signed. Strom was told a contract would be available to sign upon the completion of his twelve game ABA playoff officiating schedule. Strom called the league to ask why he was not scheduled to officiate after his guaranteed schedule of games and was told by Norm Drucker, then supervisor of officials for the ABA, "You know the reason. They know you're going back the NBA and they told me not to assign you any more playoff games."
Return to the National Basketball Association.
With his ABA career over following the playoffs in 1972, Strom contacted Nucatola to get an NBA contract signed for the 1972–73 NBA season. Nucatola told Strom to call back after the conclusion of the 1972 NBA Playoffs. Strom called Nucatola following the NBA playoffs, but was told to "wait a little longer." Strom continued to have difficulties with Nucatola over the next several months and finally sought the assistance of Richie Phillips, a Philadelphia attorney and NBA player representative. Strom filed a $275,000 suit against the NBA in December 1972 for breach of an oral contract when John Nucatola told Strom that he could return to the league. The league filed preliminary objections to have the suit dismissed, but were overruled by the court. The NBA then moved for summary judgment which was denied. Concerned that there could be legitimate action taken, the NBA decided to give Strom his job back if he dropped the suit. Strom agreed to the terms and signed a contract before the start of the 1973–74 NBA season.
National Basketball Association (1973–1990).
Changes in the National Basketball Association.
Strom returned to the NBA and was among a regular staff of twenty officials. Since Strom had left the NBA in 1969, referees now made twice the salary and received pension, health, and insurance plans.
Memorable games.
Strom ejected Chicago Bulls mascot, Benny the Bull, in the third game of the 1974 NBA Playoffs series between the Bulls and Milwaukee Bucks. Strom had ejected head coach Dick Motta after receiving a second technical foul for storming onto the court to argue with referee Don Murphy. As Motta left the court, Benny charged onto the court after Murphy and made obscene gestures to both officials, prompting the ejection. It is believed to be the first time a mascot was thrown out of an NBA game in history.
During a game in 1982, Frank Layden, then head coach of the Utah Jazz, had seen enough of his team's poor performance and wanted an early exit. Layden verbally abused Strom so he could get ejected from the game. Strom knew what he was trying to do, and when Layden asked why he didn't eject him, Strom replied, "I know what you're trying to do, Frank, but if I've got to stay out here and watch this shit, so do you". After Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics, Red Auerbach confronted Strom in the hallway near the locker rooms and told Strom, "That was the worst officiated game I ever saw!", referring to the fact that the Lakers shot 14 free throws in the fourth quarter to the Celtics' 1. Strom stared back at Auerbach and said, "Arnold, you're showing all the class I knew you always had."
The Atlanta Hawks and Chicago Bulls played a game in the late-1980s that Strom officiated. Chicago's Michael Jordan attempted a slam dunk on a fast break and was undercut by an Atlanta player. Strom called a flagrant foul and a player on the Atlanta bench yelled at Strom, "Ah, you're just protecting the superstars" to which Strom replied, "Damn right I am, you eliminate these guys from the game and we're all out of work." Strom officiated Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's final game during the 1989 NBA Finals. Strom congratulated Jabbar and gave him the game ball in the locker room.
Referee strike.
During the 1977 NBA Playoffs, twenty-four of the regular referees in the NBA went on strike. Strom and Richie Powers were the only two referees not to strike. Strom honored his contract since he felt that it was valid through the season and a strike would be a violation of the contract. Referees were seeking the right to collective bargaining, an arbitration clause that would lessen the power that team owners have on officials, life insurance paid to age sixty-five, severance pay, increase in salary and playoff pay, and an increase expense compensation. After fifteen days and two rounds of the playoffs, the referees union, the National Association of Basketball Referees, was recognized as a bargaining agent for officials and playoff salaries increased from $150 a game to $750, $850, and $950 for the final three rounds of the playoffs. During the strike, Strom was officiating a playoff game between the Portland Trail Blazers and Denver Nuggets in Denver, Colorado and was notified at the conclusion of the game of a death threat against him phoned in to McNichols Arena at halftime.
Controversies.
Strom's first notable incident since returning to the league that received attention by the NBA front office was during the 1974–75 NBA season. Strom officiated a game in Seattle and inadvertently pushed a woman who approached him at the scorer's table at the conclusion of the game. Seattle SuperSonics guard Fred Brown pushed Strom into the crowd as retaliation for what he had done to the woman. Bill Russell, who was coaching the SuperSonics at the time and referee Hugh Evans separated Strom and Brown from a further altercation. Strom originally was going to be suspended six games by commissioner J. Walter Kennedy, but was changed to a $600 fine. Strom went to the referees union to appeal the fine based on the notion that he was trying to defend himself. The union did not follow through with the appeal, but the fine was rescinded a year later by new commissioner Larry O'Brien and Strom was reimbursed his fine payment.
Strom was officiating a NBA game during the mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Dick Bavetta as his partner for that game. The game was close at the end and Earl made a last-second call against the Nets, ending the game with a win for Sixers. Suddenly Dick Bavetta ran across floor to the scorer's table, saying, "No! No! I got a push off against McGinnis!" Strom then challenged Bavetta, "Are you overruling my call? I got pushing off right here!" Bavetta insisted, which reversed Strom's call and the Nets wound up with the victory. With the game over, players were walking to their respective locker rooms when the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Dick Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom stepped out into the hallway and hollered after Bavetta, "You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?" Strom was later fined for the incident.
Strom was suspended from working any further games in the 1976 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Phoenix Suns after Game 2 because the Suns had complained about the foul disparity of the first two games in the series. In the first two games, the Celtics attempted 58 free throws while the Suns had 44.
Strom wrote a weekly column for newspapers near Pottstown which provided a perspective of the life of an NBA referee. In the spring of 1979, Strom criticized Chicago Bulls team management, in particular president Jonathan Kovler, over the firing of head coach Larry Costello after 56 games. While this incident was occurring, shortly after, Strom was involved in a shoving match with a fan and security officer following a game played in Phoenix, Arizona. These incidents led to Strom being suspended the remainder of the 1979 NBA Playoffs and was required to apologize to Kovler. In order to keep his job, Strom assured the league that there would be no animosity directed towards the Bulls and decided to discontinue writing his weekly column.
During the early 1980s, "The Philadelphia Inquirer" spoke with Strom to get a perspective on the life of an NBA referee for an article. The sports reporter met Strom in a hotel lobby and was later joined by Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach, John Killelea. The three of them discussed referees and life in the NBA. When the article was published, the reporter wrote that he and Strom were joined by an assistant coach, whom Strom had bought a drink, and the tendencies for Strom to go into pressboxes to drink a cup of coffee and to talk with spectators that he knew in the stands. While the league had approved the article, Strom was fined $2,000 and suspended a portion of the playoffs.
During the mid-1980s, Strom had a couple incidents with team personnel being in the referees' locker room, which was against league rules. In 1985, Dallas Mavericks owner Don Carter entered the locker room and accused Strom of having a vendetta against Dick Motta, coach of the Mavericks. The next year during the 1986 NBA Playoffs game between the Atlanta Hawks and Boston Celtics at Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, Hawks coach Mike Fratello was attacked by a fan. Fratello walked into the officials locker room and reported the incident to Strom. Strom eventually was fined and worked a couple more playoff games that year.
Nearly halfway through the 1987–88 NBA season, Strom was fined $150 for reversing a field goal that San Antonio Spurs' Mike Mitchell made at the end of the half against the Indiana Pacers. Strom was concerned about making the correct call after being told by Pacers coach Jack Ramsay and referee Tommy Nuñez that Mitchell's shot attempt came after the period expired.
Final years.
During the 1989–90 NBA season, "USA Today" took a poll on the best players, coaches, and referees in the league as voted by coaches and players. Strom was considered the league's top official in the NBA, receiving 83 out of a possible 193 votes. At the same time, the "Detroit Free Press" conducted a survey of 500 players, coaches, general managers, broadcasters, writers, and fans to determine the best official in each professional sport. Strom was chosen as the best official in the NBA and the top official overall among Bruce Froemming (Major League Baseball), Jim Tunney (National Football League), and Andy Van Hellemond (National Hockey League).
Strom's final game was Game 4 of the 1990 NBA Finals between the Detroit Pistons and Portland Trail Blazers played June 12, 1990 in a game that saw Strom correctly wave off Trail Blazers Danny Young's half-court heave that would have sent the game into OT, had it come before the buzzer.
Post officiating career.
After his retirement from the NBA, Strom worked as a television color commentator and wrote a book detailing his officiating career entitled, "Calling the Shots: My Five Decades in the NBA" in 1990. Strom also participated in charitable events, such as being involved in a celebrity golf tournament hosted by Penn State University, and coaching at a basketball tournament run by Celtics great Larry Bird in Indianapolis, Indiana. Not long before his death, Strom wrote a column for the "Reading Eagle" and "Chicago Sun-Times". It was through this column that Strom discovered he had a malignant brain tumor, a form of cancer, by doctors after his wife, Yvonne, found grammatical errors as she prepared to type the column on a computer. Strom began surgery on the tumor in January 1994, which was successful, but he could not overcome the effects of the cancer and died on July 10, 1994.
Legacy.
Strom retired having officiated 2,067 NBA games over 29 years. Currently, only referees Dick Bavetta and Jake O'Donnell have officiated more games. Strom was selected to officiate five of the nine NBA Finals that went seven games (the maximum number of games possible in a series) in 1966, 1969, 1978, 1984, and 1988, and is considered the last of an era for the "charismatic referee" type to officiate in the NBA. This is in contrast to today's officials who are said to blend into the background during a game and all bear a similar appearance and use of hand signals. During his career in the NBA, Strom was given the nickname of the "Road Ref" by Harvey Pollack, a statistician for the Philadelphia 76ers. Throughout the year, Pollack noted how many times the home or visiting team was victorious and who were the officials working the game. Strom had the highest percentage of road team victories among NBA referees at 42.9 perecent. This was the result of Strom refusing to favor the home team and letting the fans sway his decisions.
When Strom started his career in the NBA, he felt the most important aspect was to "get the play right". Instead of selling a bad call, he felt that officials should admit their mistake, and get the call right. To get plays called correctly, he brought up the idea of limited use of instant replay for shots made at the end of a period ("buzzer beaters") and three-point attempts. The NBA eventually adopted the use of instant replay for end of the period field goal attempts and fouls at the start of the 2002–03 NBA season. Strom believed that referee's job was to ensure the game is played correctly, which will allow players to play their particular style. As the NBA began to evolve, Strom opposed the addition of the third official in NBA game for one season, the 1977–78 NBA season, and later in its present form since the 1988–89 NBA season. Strom felt that well-conditioned officials who are able to stay on top of the play would be able to make calls that a third official would be responsible for.
Pottstown High School created the "Earl Strom Financial Aid Scholarship", which is awarded to a member of the senior class who has been accepted by an accredited college.

Radek Černý

Radek Černý (born 18 February 1974) is a Czech footballer who currently plays as a goalkeeper for Slavia Prague. He played principally for Slavia Prague in the Gambrinus Liga between its inception in 1993 and 2005, when he moved to England. Černý spent eight years in England with Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers before returning to his former club Slavia in 2013. Černý enjoyed a brief international career, making three appearances for the Czech Republic between 2000 and 2002.
Club career.
Slavia Prague.
Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Černý turned professional in 1993 as a 17-year-old with Slavia Prague, his home team. His father was a goalkeeper, who started out as a youth at Slavia before playing in the Czech third and fourth divisions, while Černý's older brother Petr was another goalkeeper playing for the club.
Černý did not get a chance to play for Slavia in the early years of his career, having been loaned out to three different Czech clubs and not returning until 1997, when he finally made his debut. Petr Černý was later signed as a deputy to his younger brother.
Černý played for SK České Budějovice JČE in the first two seasons of the Gambrinus Liga and Union Cheb in the third before playing for Slavia's first team. He went on to make more than 150 appearances for Slavia, many of them in European competition. He was twice a domestic cup winner and scored one goal, the last goal in a 4-0 league victory against FK Jablonec 97 in the 1999-2000 season.
Tottenham Hotspur.
Černý joined Spurs on an 18-month loan in January 2005, which was extended until the end of 2008 to replace Kasey Keller who, finding himself unable to win back the Spurs number one jersey from Paul Robinson, had signed for Borussia Mönchengladbach. Spurs had also signed Márton Fülöp, a young Hungarian goalkeeper, in the previous summer, but it was Černý who was called to deputise for Robinson for the last three games of the 2004/05 season. He made his debut at White Hart Lane against Aston Villa. Spurs won 5–1 but were unable to win a UEFA Cup spot that season.
Černý played in the Peace Cup pre-season tournament in South Korea, which Spurs won, but once Robinson returned, Černý was back on the bench again. Černý did not make an appearance in the 2005/06 season as Spurs finished fifth.
The 2006/07 season was more of the same for Černý, as Robinson, now the established number one for club and country, was initially playing in all of Spurs' matches, despite them playing in four competitions. Fülöp had left to join Sunderland and Robert Burch, a former youth team player, was being loaned out without starting for any of the clubs who employed him. Robinson was injured in March 2007 for the FA Cup quarter-final at Chelsea where Černý made his first competitive appearance for nearly two years in a memorable match that ended 3–3. Robinson returned for the replay, which Spurs lost 2–1. Černý was on the bench for the rest of the season as Spurs finished fifth again.
The 2007/08 season began badly for Spurs, with Martin Jol leaving in November 2007 and Robinson under pressure after making a number of goalkeeping errors. New manager Juande Ramos eventually lost patience with Robinson's loss of form and for the first time in his Tottenham Hotspur career, Černý displaced Robinson, being preferred for the League Cup semi-final first-leg at Arsenal. However, Robinson again replaced Černý after a Černý goalkeeping error in the UEFA Cup against his former team threatened Tottenham's chances of winning in the round.
Queens Park Rangers.
On 4 May 2008, Černý told Sky Sports News that he would be joining QPR of the Championship at the end of the season because of the lack of first team action at Spurs. The transfer was confirmed on 13 May. He made his debut in the QPR 2–1 victory over Barnsley at Loftus Road. After some uncertain displays at the start of the year, a string of fine performances enabled Černý to establish himself as the R's first-choice goalkeeper. He was left out of the 2012–13 QPR Premier League squad, losing out to fellow goalkeepers, Julio Cesar, Robert Green and Brian Murphy.
Return to Slavia Prague.
Radek Černý is currently on tests back in his homeclub Slavia Prague before the season 2013/2014.
International career.
Černý has represented the Czech Republic at youth level, earning 11 caps for the Czech under-21s. He has also represented them at full international level with three caps for the senior Czech Republic, during his time at Slavia Prague.

SCA fencing

SCA Fencing is a style of historical fencing practiced in the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). The primary focus is to study, replicate and compete with styles of rapier sword-fighting found in Europe during the Renaissance period, using blunted steel swords and a variety of off-hand defensive items. Participants wear period clothing while competing, along with or incorporating protective equipment (such as modern fencing masks) for safety. Members of the society sometimes refer to the sport as simply rapier.
History.
Since the founding day of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), there was an interest in simulated combat sport with a "medieval style". The first "tournaments" were highly informal and used a mishmash of fencing equipment and wooden weapons. The first combat style among the SCA that evolved into a formal rule set from this was Armored Combat, which uses wooden, padded and rubber weapons along with specially made body armor unique to that style.
As early as 1969, there were informal discussions about introducing "rapier and dagger" style combat as a society activity. Several early rule sets using sport fencing-like systems were experimented with in the 1970s, with rules and activities being adopted in several kingdoms. In 1979 the Society Board of Directors formally approved the activity and approved the first set of rules.
Overall, the goal is distinct style within the organization focused more on the civilian dueling styles of the 14th, 15th and 16th century. Unlike the aforementioned armored combat, fencing in the SCA is closer to the modern sport fencing, using light body protection and flexible metal swords, though the rules are much less rigid. Since the time of its introduction, fencing has gained a significant following in the SCA, and having over one hundred competitors is not uncommon at larger event tournaments. The ultimate goal of SCA fencing as stated by the rules is to safely simulate fencing "with a real blade, extremely sharp on point and edge."
Equipment.
Weapons.
A wide variety of different blades and sword styles are permitted, but all fall into one of two classes: "Light rapier" and "heavy rapier." It is not permitted for the two classes of rapier to be used against each other; participants must all be using light or heavy. Light rapiers consist of commercially manufactured foil and épée, though the hilt and guard are sometimes replaced or altered to make them more closely resemble a historical sword. Heavy rapier are full-sized replicas of historical swords, with certain differences for safety reasons: The edges and tip must be blunt, with tips covered with a cap made of rubber, leather or plastic. Heavy rapier blades must pass a minimum flexibility test to be used.
In addition to strictly "rapier" hilt types, other period swords are permitted so long as the blade meets the aforementioned safety criteria. These include side-swords, two-handed swords such as longswords, and single-edged swords including Großes Messer, szablas, scimitars, and katanas.
Besides a primary sword, combatants are permitted to use an additional item in their off-hand. These include a parrying dagger (or "main gauche"), a shield or buckler, a cloak or other flexible item, a cane, stick, or baton, or even a second sword (known as wielding "a case of rapiers"). Nearly any item is permitted so long as it is durable, has no sharp edges and is not likely or designed to trap an opponent's sword in an unsafe manner. An empty off-hand may be employed to parry as well, but is vulnerable to normal thrusts and cuts from the opponent's weapon.
Protective Gear.
Since the entire body is a potential target, a participant's entire body must be covered. No bare skin may show, and all clothing must be at least durable enough to not snag open or tear from light abrasions. Certain areas of the body must have stronger protection. For example the front of the head, the neck and the top of the spine must be protected by rigid items. A modern, regulation fencing mask is the most common type due to their low cost and reliability, though some fencers wear steel helmets of a more historical design. The neck and top vertebrae are protected by a gorget made of heavy leather and/or steel. The torso and armpits must be covered with a heavy fabric of some sort or leather, that is sufficiently strong to resist puncturing if a blade were to break during a bout. Men are required to wear a protective cup, and women are encouraged to wear chest protection. Fencers must also make an attempt to approximate medieval or Renaissance dress. Popular outfits tend to be based on 14th to 16th century European clothing, but participants are free to design their outfit after any pre-1600 culture normally acceptable with the SCA, including styles of the Middle East, China and Japan. It is a popular tradition in the SCA for female fencers to dress in male attire (similar to La Maupin), though this is by no means a requirement.
Competitions and rules.
As fencing in the SCA is intended to be first and foremost fun, safety is the primary concern. All fencing practices and tournaments in the SCA are run by fencing "marshals" who are warranted to watch for unsafe behavior, inspect equipment, and "authorize" others to fence in tournaments (much like a referee). The "authorization" process includes a test of knowledge of fencing rules and bouts fought with previously authorized fencers under the marshal's supervision; the goal is not to prove the fencer's ability to win bouts, but his or her ability to participate safely and courteously in both tournaments and casual sparring. No fencers may compete in an SCA tournament until they have passed authorization, though they can participate in practice bouts until that time.
Unlike modern fencing, SCA fencing has no restrictions or divisions based on gender.
List field.
SCA fencing is conducted in an open space permitting sideways movement, rather than back and forth on a linear strip as in conventional sport fencing. The fencers may move freely within a designated fighting space called the "list field". These fields may be any size and are often outdoors. Bouts are observed by one or more marshals, who monitor the fencers for safety as well advising when a fencer is too close to the boundaries of the field. There is no penalty for accidentally bumping into or backing over a boundary; it most often results in the match being halted temporarily for the combatants to re-position.
Valid attacks.
The entire body is considered a valid target, and there is no "priority" (right-of-way) rule, similar to sport épée.
A valid blow is scored with either a thrust in line with the blade or a cut with the edge of the blade. In normal rapier rules, the edge may only be used for draw-cuts (placing the blade and pulling or pushing it on the opponent's body), while under "cut and thrust rapier" rules, percussive blows with the edge are also permitted. Only a sword or dagger may be used to strike an opponent. Participants cannot punch, kick, grab, body check or otherwise make physical contact with their opponent's body (beyond unintended fleeting contact), and may not strike an opponent with a shield, cloak, stick or any other parrying device.
The scoring of a blow is based on an honor system; it is the responsibility of the fencer being hit to acknowledge a valid attack from the opponent. The fencer who is struck verbally acknowledges the blow by calling out in a loud voice, or in certain types of combat, dramatically acting out the hit for showmanship. No fencing directors, judges or electronic scoring systems are used. The fighting is overseen by a marshal who monitors the bout for safety and fair play from both participants, but is not permitted to judge the validity of an attack. However, the marshal has the ability to warn a fighter in cases where an obvious blow went unacknowledged, usually by politely asking if they are certain they were not struck. In extremely rare cases, the fighter's authorization to fence can be revoked.
Bouts usually continue until one fighter is struck by an "incapacitating" blow or otherwise becomes disinclined to continue. A fighter may also yield (concede victory to the opponent) at any time during the bout. An "incapacitating" blow is defined as a valid attack to the head, neck, torso, armpit or inner groin area. Attacks to the legs or arms are considered "disabling". A hit to the arm disables that arm, which is held behind the fencer's back or hanging limply at their side. Fencers whose sword arm is disabled can switch hands. Some kingdoms use rules with additional details for strikes to the hand, which may simply disable the hand (represented by making a fist) or apply to the whole arm. For a strike to the leg or foot, the fencer can continue fighting but must kneel, sit on the ground, or balance on one leg. Under Cut and Thrust rules, hits to the leg or foot are considered incapacitating. Many kingdoms contain additional clarifications of these rules, such as only permitting sitting on the ground when the leg is hit, and/or limiting the permitted angle of approach for the opponent while seated (to avoid unsafe strikes to the back).
Bouts can be one-on-one, or a "mêlée" where more than two fencers are involved. Melees can involve teams of fencers that must work as a group, or an every-man-for-himself "grand mêlée". One important matter of safety in a mêlée is attacking an unaware fencer from behind. Normally this is not permitted unless it is announced before that particular match. When allowed, the attacking fencer must not slash or stab an opponent who doesn't know they are there, but rather must lay their blade on his or her shoulder so the tip is visible to the opponent and verbally tell them they have been "killed" in a loud voice.
Tournaments.
SCA tournaments are usually conducted in rounds with winners of each round advancing towards the finals.
Some common tournament formats are:
Mêlées.
Mêlées between groups of fencers often take place at SCA events; these can be merely mock-brawls between disorganized "factions," but sophisticated small unit tactics are often seen. At Pennsic or the Gulf War it is not unknown for more than two hundred fencers to take the field for a "battle".
The SCA also allows simulations of period firearms to be used under certain conditions in fencing mêlées.
These simulations fire large "rubber bands" made of surgical tubing looped around and securely joined. "Wheel lock" pistols are most common, but muskets are not unknown.
This ammunition has enough mass to allow the target to feel its impact through fencing armor, but is light enough to prevent injury. Some SCA fencers have even built light cannon firing as many as fourteen rubber bands at a single shot, thus simulating the effects of grape shot.
Fencing titles and awards.
There are many different awards for fencing within the Society.
Historical fencing and the SCA.
Along with their practice of fencing, many SCA fencers also study period fencing manuals such as those by Ridolfo Capo Ferro, Giacomo di Grassi, Camillo Agrippa, and Carranza. However, the safety rules and weapon simulators used by SCA fencers prevent many of the concepts in period manuals being implemented. This is not necessarily a criticism; the need to maintain a fun atmosphere, minimize the cost of equipment, and encourage fencers to continue participating in the SCA makes it impossible to demand the level of training needed to safely practice true period technique, as done by stricter historical fencing groups.
Criticism.
Acknowledging blows.
It is possible within the SCA's rules to refuse to acknowledge a valid hit in order to win a bout. This occurs often enough that the slang term "Rhinohide" is used to describe an SCA combatant who fails to accept a valid attack. In extreme or obvious cases, a marshal can warn the offending fighter by asking him or her if they are certain they have not been struck. In some rare cases, repeat offenders have had their fighting privileges temporarily or even permanently revoked.
At the very least, the offending individual quickly acquires a reputation for being a dishonorable combatant, with the attendant social stigma.
Draw cuts.
Some fencers argue that draw cuts are not martially sound techniques and make cutting a due tempi ("double time") action, whereas a percussive cutting action would be in stesso tempo ("single time"). A counter-argument to this is that the slender, light blade of the rapier is a poor "chopping" blade and in period was often not particularly sharp. A drawing cut was far more effective for inflicting a serious wound.

Bristle-spined rat

The bristle-spined rat, Chaetomys subspinosus, is an arboreal rodent from Brazil. Also known as the bristle-spined porcupine or thin-spined porcupine, it is the only member of the genus Chaetomys and the subfamily Chaetomyinae. It was officially described in 1818, but rarely sighted since, until December 1986 when two specimens - one a pregnant female - were found in the vicinity of Valencia in Bahia State.
Characteristics.
Bristle-spined rats are named because the spines on the back are more bristle-like in texture than the spines on the rest of the body. They have long naked tails which are not prehensile. Adult animals weigh around .
Their skulls are unusual in several ways. The eye socket is almost completely surrounded by a ring of bone. Incisors are distinctly narrow. Overall, the animal displays a mix of New World porcupine cranial characters, spiny rat cranial characters, and characters that set it apart from all other rodents.
The bristle-spined rat is restricted to remnant forests and forest edges in the Atlantic coastal forests on the East Coast of Brazil. Its habitat is dwindling rapidly and the species may be vulnerable to extinction. It is classified as vulnerable by IUCN and endangered by USDI (Nowak, 1999
Taxonomic controversy.
No consensus has been reached as to the taxonomic position of "Chaetomys". It is commonly placed with the New World porcupines in the family Erethizontidae or with the spiny rats the family Echimyidae. Both are South American hystricognaths with hairs modified as spines or quills. "Chaetomys" has more highly developed spines than the spiny rats, but less developed than the porcupines. Characteristics of the premolar suggest that it belongs with the Echimyidae, but characteristics of the incisor enamel suggest that it belongs in the Erethizontidae. 
Patterson and Pascual (1968), Patterson and Wood (1982), Woods (1982, 1984, 1993) Patton and Reig (1989), Nowak (1999), and Carvalho (2000) support the inclusion of this animal in Echimyidae whereas Martin (1994), McKenna and Bell (1997), Carvalho and Salles (2004), and Woods and Kilpatrick (2005) argue that it belongs in Erethizontidae. Emmons (2005) mentions the family "Chaetomyidae" without much further comment except to exclude it from Echimyidae.
A molecular phylogeny based on the mitochondrial gene coding for cytochrome b combined to karyological evidence actually suggests that "Chaetomys" is more closely related to the Erethizontidae than to the Echimyidae, although it branches as the sister group to the rest of the Erethizontidae.

Philippe Charles Lucien Christanval (born 31 August 1978 in Paris) is a retired French footballer of Guadeloupian origin who most recently played for Fulham as a centre back. During his career, he played top-flight football in France, Spain and England, and earned six full international caps, as well as a selection to the 2002 FIFA World Cup.
Club career.
Monaco.
His career began at AS Monaco in 1999, where he made 81 appearances, scoring one goal. They won the 1999-2000 league title, earning him the title of Young Player of the Year, and he made several UEFA Champions League appearances. In January 2001, it was reported that Monaco were considering exchanging him for Frank LeBoeuf of Chelsea.
Barcelona and Marseille.
Christanval was then signed by Barcelona of Spain's La Liga for a £6.5million fee in June 2001, the team he supported as a child. After being released from Barcelona in 2003, he joined Marseille on 18 July on a four-year contract. They reached the 2004 UEFA Cup Final in his first season, but he was an unused substitute as they lost 2-0 to Valencia.
Fulham.
After two weeks on trial at Arsenal, their manager Arsène Wenger opted not to sign Christanval. He then joined another Premier League London team, Fulham, on 9 September 2005. Upon his signing, manager Chris Coleman stated:
In his first appearances at Fulham, he found himself playing in defensive midfield with Papa Bouba Diop. He was later moved back to his typical position. His first Premier League goal was a late equaliser in a 3–3 draw with West Ham United on 13 January 2006.
In the 2007-08 season he made a single substitute appearance. At the end of the season, Christanval was released by Fulham and was offered a trial with Premier League club Blackburn Rovers. On 9 April 2009, Christanval retired from football, having been unable to find a new club.
International.
Christanval was a part of the France at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship.
He made his full debut on 7 October 2001, in a 0-0 friendly draw away to South Africa. Christanval played four more friendlies in 2002 before his last appearance, a 2-1 away win against Cyprus in qualification for Euro 2004. He was selected for the 2002 FIFA World Cup but did not enter the field of play.

Costas Mandylor (born Costas Theodosopoulos; 3 September 1965) is a Greek Australian actor. He is best known for his role as Kenny in "Picket Fences", and for portraying Mark Hoffman in the "Saw" films.
Early life.
Mandylor was born in Melbourne, the son of Louise (née Mandylaris) and Yannis Theodosopoulos, who is a taxi driver. He is of Greek ancestry. Mandylor took a version of his mother's maiden name, citing his real name in Greek being too long. He grew up in St Kilda and South Melbourne. He moved to the United States in 1987 where he started taking acting lessons. He was initially unable to find any work acting and had to work any job available.
Career.
Mandylor's first major role was in the 1989 film "Triumph of the Spirit" playing a European Jew, which was filmed at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. He returned to Los Angeles meeting director Oliver Stone and auditioned and got the role of an Italian count in "The Doors" (1991). Mandylor landed a leading role in "Mobsters" playing a New York gangster, Frank Costello. He went mentally prepared for the role, telling the "Los Angeles Times", "It was interesting that I got that part, because I felt tuned in to gangsters, it was a genre I'd read a lot. When I was 13, I got a job as a dishwasher in a Melbourne nightclub and saw everything there, real gangsters, and had met characters who were dangerous people from an underground world." In 1992 he had a lead role on the CBS television drama, "Picket Fences", playing officer Kenny Lacos until the show ended in 1996. Mandylor also had a lead role in the "Saw" films as Detective Mark Hoffman.
Personal life.
Mandylor played professional soccer in Europe until suffering shin splints. In 1991, he was chosen by "People" as one of the "50 Most Beautiful People in the world". Mandylor married Talisa Soto in May 1997; they divorced in 2000. His brother, Louis Mandylor, is also an actor.

Venetian glass

Venetian glass is a type of glass object made in Venice, Italy, primarily on the island of Murano. It is world-renowned for being colourful, elaborate, and skillfully made.
Many of the important characteristics of these objects had been developed by the thirteenth century. Toward the end of that century, the centre of the Venetian glass industry moved to Murano.
Byzantine craftsmen played an important role in the development of Venetian glass, an art form for which the city is well-known. When Constantinople was sacked by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, some fleeing artisans came to Venice. This happened again when the Ottomans took Constantinople in 1453, supplying Venice with still more glassworkers. By the sixteenth century, Venetian artisans had gained even greater control over the colour and transparency of their glass, and had mastered a variety of decorative techniques.
Despite efforts to keep Venetian glassmaking techniques within Venice, they became known elsewhere, and Venetian-style glassware was produced in other Italian cities and other countries of Europe.
Some of the most important brands of glass in the world today, including Venini, Barovier & Toso, Pauly and Seguso., are still produced in the historical glass factories on Murano. Barovier & Toso is considered to be one of the 100 oldest companies in continuous operation in the world, having been founded in 1295.
History of Murano Glassmaking.
Murano’s reputation as a centre for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire and destruction to the city’s mostly wood buildings, ordered the destruction of all the foundries within the city in 1291. Though the Republic ordered the destruction of the foundries, it authorised and encouraged construction outside the city, and by the late 13th century, the glassmaking industry was centred in Murano. Murano glass is still interwoven with Venetian glass.
Murano's glassmakers were soon the island’s most prominent citizens. By the 14th century, glassmakers were allowed to wear swords, enjoyed immunity from prosecution by the Venetian state and found their daughters married into Venice’s most affluent families. Of course there was a catch: Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the Republic. Many craftsmen took this risk, however, and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands. 
Murano’s glassmakers held a monopoly on quality glassmaking for centuries, developing or refining many technologies including crystalline glass, enameled glass ("smalto"), glass with threads of gold ("aventurine"), multicoloured glass ("millefiori"), milk glass ("lattimo"), and imitation gemstones made of glass. Today, the artisans of Murano are still employing these centuries-old techniques, crafting everything from contemporary art glass and glass jewelry to Murano glass chandeliers and wine stoppers. 
Today, Murano is home to the "Museo Vetrario" or Glass Museum in the Palazzo Giustinian, which holds displays on the history of glassmaking, as well as glass samples ranging from Egyptian times through the present day.
The Art of Glassmaking.
The process of making Murano glass is rather complex. The glass is made from silica, which becomes liquid at high temperatures. As the glass passes from a liquid to a solid state, there is an interval when the glass is soft before it hardens completely. This is when the glass-master can shape the material. 
Materials.
The other raw materials, called fluxes or melting agents, allow the glass to soften at lower temperatures. The more sodium oxide present in the glass, the slower it solidifies. This is important for hand-working because it allows the glassmaker more time to shape the material. The various raw materials an artisan might add to a glass mixture are sodium (to reduce melting temperature), nitrate and arsenic (to eliminate bubbles) and colouring or opacifying substances.
Colours, techniques and materials.
Colours, techniques and materials vary depending upon the look a glassmaker is trying to achieve. Aquamarine is created through the use of copper and cobalt compounds, whereas ruby red uses a gold solution as a colouring agent. Murrine technique begins with the layering of coloured liquid glass, which is then stretched into long rods called canes (caneworking). When cold, these canes are then sliced in cross-section, which has the layered pattern. The better-known term "millefiori" is a style of murrine that is defined by each layer of molten colour being shaped by a mold into a star, then cooled and layered again. When sliced, this type of murrine has many points, thus mille (thousand) fiori (flowers). Filigree (a type of caneworking), "incalmo", enamel painted, glass engraving, gold engraving, "lattimo", ribbed glass and submersion are just a few of the other techniques a glassmaker can employ.
Tools.
Murano artisans use specialised tools in the making of their glass. Some of these tools include "borselle" (tongs or pliers used to hand-form the red-hot glass), "canna da soffio" (blowing pipe), "pontello" (an iron rod to which the craftsman attaches the glass after blowing to add final touches), "scagno" (the glass-master's work bench) and "tagianti" (large glass-cutting clippers).

<doc id="2851719" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851719" title="Raman amplification">
Raman amplification

Raman amplification is based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) phenomenon, when a lower frequency 'signal' photon induces the inelastic scattering of a higher-frequency 'pump' photon in an optical medium in the nonlinear regime. As a result of this, another 'signal' photon is produced, with the surplus energy resonantly passed to the vibrational states of the medium. This process, as with other stimulated emission processes, allows all-optical amplification. Optical fiber is today mostly used as the nonlinear medium for SRS, for telecom purposes; in this case it is characterized by a resonance frequency downshift of ~11 THz (corresponding to a wavelength shift at ~1550 nm of ~90 nm). The SRS amplification process can be readily cascaded, thus accessing essentially any wavelength in the fiber low-loss guiding windows (both 1310 and 1550). In addition to applications in nonlinear and ultrafast optics, Raman amplification is used in optical telecommunications, allowing all-band wavelength coverage and in-line distributed signal amplification.

<doc id="2851723" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851723" title="Australian Monarchist League">
Australian Monarchist League

The Australian Monarchist League is a non-profit organisation, headquartered in Sydney, Australia, promoting the monarchy of Australia, and providing information to members of the public about Australian history and the Australian Constitution. The organisation was part of the "no" campaign in the 1999 republic referendum, which asked whether Australia should become a republic and whether Australia should alter the constitution to insert a preamble. Neither of the amendments passed.
Structure.
The Australian Monarchist League is incorporated as an association in New South Wales, and was originally founded as a branch of the London-based International Monarchist League (IML). However, in 1993, the League severed affiliation with the IML, and established itself as an independent Australian body. (A separate organisation, the Monarchist League in Australia, was formed in 2006 as an affiliate of the IML). The organisation is not formally associated with any political party or other organisation, and it has no paid staff, relying on volunteers to keep the group functioning. Philip Benwell, has served on a volunteer basis as the national chairman and spokesman for the league for over ten years.
The League has established a Trust with a number of prominent Australian businessmen as Trustees. The most important role of the Trust is to raise and administer funds for the organisation's activities.
Activities.
1999 republic referendum.
During the 1999 republic referendum on the future of Australia's constitutional monarchy, the league along with the four other constitutional monarchist groups formed a united front led by Lloyd Waddy emphasising the weaknesses of the republican models on offer. Positions on the official Vote No Committee were filled according to votes received at the Convention election. Accordingly all eight monarchist seats went to an alternative organization which had won 73.39 % of the monarchist vote, Australians for Constitutional Monarchy (along with two supporting an elected head of state). Nevertheless, the Australian Monarchist League played a role in the proceedings, including Benwell privately taking the Australian Electoral Commission to the Federal Court in an unsuccessful attempt to gain a firmer definition of what would count as a "yes" vote in the referendum, arguing that the planned approach (accepting any vote in which the voter's intention was clear) was such that the counting would be weighted towards "yes" and "opened the door for electoral fraud".
Recent activities.
Both prior and subsequent to the referendum, the Australian Monarchist League has acted to protect the image of the constitutional monarchy. In 2005 the organisation lodged formal complaints about an image depicting Princess Diana by photographer Erwin Olaf at the Australian Centre for Photography. Similarly, they wrote to the Japanese ambassador in 1998 after Toyota ran an advertisement showing a Range Rover with the words "Don't worry, Your Majesty, you're not the only British export that's had its day", resulting in Toyota withdrawing the advertisement; and in 2008 complained to both the Coopers Brewery and the Advertising Standards Bureau after Coopers ran an advertisement stating "Forget the monarchy, support the publicans", forcing its withdrawal.
Along with their actions during the referendum, the League have been active in protecting the symbols of Australia's constitutional monarchy; they acted to ensure that the pledge of loyalty to the monarch remained a part of Scouts Australia, and spoke against the removal of references to the Queen from the Victorian legal system. Aside from campaigning, the AML distributed copies of William Dargie's portrait of Queen Elizabeth II after the Commonwealth Government Bookshops ceased selling photographs of the monarch.
Other activities include disseminating literature and maintaining a library on Australian history and the Australian Constitution, and conducting public seminars.
Membership.
The League has approximately 3000 members as of 2008, with branches in each State and in the Australian Capital Territory. All office bearers are elected by the membership and serve on a voluntary basis.

Campbell Barracks

Campbell Barracks, in Heidelberg, Germany, was the location of the Headquarters of the United States Army in Europe and Seventh Army (HQ USAREUR/7A, as well as V Corps and the headquarters of NATO’s Component Command-Land Headquarters, Heidelberg.
Early history.
As part of the Nazi military buildup, the German 110th Infantry Regiment was activated in May 1936 and stationed in Heidelberg. The existing Grenadier-Kaserne (now Patton Barracks) was not large enough for the regiment. Accordingly, a new installation was built in 1937 on what was then farmland on the southern outskirts of Heidelberg near the suburb of Rohrbach.
At first unnamed, the new installation was designated Großdeutschland-Kaserne after Austria became part of the German Empire in March 1938. Stories linking Großdeutschland-Kaserne to the Großdeutschland Division of World War II have no foundation. The casern predates the division, which was not formed until May 1942. Neither the division nor any of its subordinate units were ever stationed in Heidelberg, nor was the 110th Infantry Regiment ever attached to the Großdeutschland-Division.
When completed, the new Heidelberg barracks became the home of the 110th Infantry's headquarters, its 1st Battalion and its two regimental support companies. The regiment's 2d Battalion was stationed at Loretto-Kaserne (now called Hammonds Barracks) in Seckenheim and the 3d Battalion at Grenadier-Kaserne. The Keyes Building on Campbell originally served as the regimental officers mess.
The first Allied troops entered Heidelberg on the morning of Good Friday, March 30, 1945, and the city surrendered without a fight. The "Wehrmacht" had left Heidelberg a day earlier but not before blowing up the bridges crossing the River Neckar, which in Heidelberg meant blowing up the old bridge.
The U.S. units that initially occupied Großdeutschland-Kaserne are not known, but by V-E Day, 8 May 1945, the headquarters of the U.S. 6th Army Group occupied the Kaserne. The Army Group headquarters was inactivated in June 1945, whereupon the headquarters of the U.S. Seventh Army moved from Augsburg to Heidelberg, officially opening at Großdeutschland-Kaserne on July 22, 1945.
The Seventh Army headquarters remained in Heidelberg until its inactivation on 31 March 1946. The headquarters of the U.S. Third Army then moved from Bad Tölz to Großdeutschland-Kaserne on 2 April 1946. In the meantime the Third Army had activated a new organization on 15 February 1946 called the U.S. Constabulary. The Constabulary was basically a police force with the mission of maintaining law and order in the U.S. Zone of occupied Germany. On February 15, 1947, the Constabulary headquarters moved from Bamberg to Großdeutschland-Kaserne and the Third Army headquarters was inactivated on March 15, 1947.
During this time the headquarters of the U.S. Army in Europe, then known as the U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET), was stationed in Frankfurt in the IG Farben Building (the Abrams Building). The same day Third Army headquarters was inactivated, USFET was redesignated as the European Command (EUCOM), not to be confused with the joint United States European Command (USEUCOM) of today.
In the series of phased moves between February and June 1948, the Constabulary headquarters moved from Heidelberg to Stuttgart and the EUCOM headquarters moved into the vacated facilities at Großdeutschland-Kaserne.
The Kaserne was formally renamed Campbell Barracks on August 23, 1948 in memory of Staff Sergeant Charles L. Campbell, 14th Infantry Regiment, 71st Infantry Division, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross posthumously for extraordinary heroism. On March 28, 1945, two days before the surrender of Heidelberg, Staff Sergeant Campbell led a patrol across the Rhine River near Mannheim and was killed while covering the withdrawal of his patrol as it returned to the west bank with valuable information.
Until July 1949, the Commander in Chief, EUCOM, was also the U.S. Military Governor of occupied Germany. His office and staff were in Berlin. The ranking officer in Heidelberg was the EUCOM Chief of Staff. While Lieutenant General Clarence R. Huebner was the EUCOM Chief of Staff, the riding hall in building 31 was converted to a (unknown name), which opened on March 4, 1949.
Joint Headquarters Activation.
The next significant organizational change came on August 1, 1952 when a new joint headquarters, the United States European Command (USEUCOM), was activated in Frankfurt. At the same time, the EUCOM headquarters in Heidelberg was redesignated the United States Army, Europe (USAREUR). A small NATO planning cell called the CENTAG Plans Staff was also established at this time within the USAREUR headquarters staff, with the Commander in Chief, USAREUR, given the additional title of Commander, CENTAG (COMCENTAG). In April 1959, the CENTAG Plans Staff was designated Headquarters, CENTAG, and separated from the USAREUR headquarters staff. The USAREUR G3 (as the Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, was then known) nevertheless continued to serve as the CENTAG Chief of Staff while serving as the USAREUR G3.
The Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR), formally activated a separated CENTAG headquarters on 1 October 1960. Between June and August 1961 the CENTAG headquarters staff moved from Campbell Barracks to Hammond Barracks in Seckenheim.
On December 1, 1966, the Seventh Army headquarters (which had been reactivated in Stuttgart in November 1950) merged with the USAREUR headquarters. This new headquarters was designated Headquarters, United States Army, Europe, and Seventh Army (HQ USAREUR/7A).
In the late 1970s, a series of studies concluded that interallied coordination would be improved by stationing three international NATO headquarters on the same installation with HQ USAREUR/7A. This resulted in the headquarters of the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force (4ATAF) moving into building 8 of Campbell Barracks in September 1980. The CENTAG headquarters returned to Campbell Barracks in December 1980, occupying offices in buildings 3,5, and 7 (with an office for the CENTAG Chief of Staff in building 1). Finally, the headquarters of the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (Land) moved to Campbell Barracks in December 1980, occupying part of building 7.
Following the Cold War.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the demise of the Soviet Union, and the dissolution of the East European Communist Bloc radically changed the politico-military situation in Europe. In addition to significant reductions and realignments of U.S. Forces in Germany, a number of changes occurred in the NATO military organizational structure, all of which affected stationing at Campbell Barracks.
On 30 June 1993 CENTAG and 4ATAF discontinued operations. On July 1, 1993, the headquarters of NATO’s Allied Land Forces Central Europe (LANDCENT) became operational on Campbell Barracks with a staff from seven nations (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States). LANDCENT moved into offices in buildings 3,7, and 8, formerly used by CENTAG and 4ATAF. The CENTAG Chief of Staff office suite in building 1 was returned to USAREUR. In the summer of 1994, V Corps headquarters moved from Frankfurt to Campbell Barracks.
The departure from the Cold War era brought the implementation of a new NATO Integrated Military Structure and LandCENT was formally designated Joint Headquarters Centre (JHQ CENT) in a ceremony held on March 9, 2000. The new structure, which accompanied this designation, included personnel from five additional nations: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Norway, and Poland - making a total of 12 NATO Nations contributing to the Headquarters.
The devastation caused in the September 11, 2001 attacks sent shock waves through the military and on April 30, 2002 the Lieutenant General Timothy J. Maude Center for Human Resources was dedicated to Timothy Maude (November 18, 1947 - September 11, 2001) in his honor. He was the highest-ranking military officer killed in the attacks at the Pentagon. He worked on Campbell Barracks from 1995 to 1998 as Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel and Installation Management. It was his last assignment before being stationed in Washington D.C.
On July 1, 2004, the Headquarters once again transitioned in a ceremony marking its designation to Component Command-Land Headquarters, Heidelberg. New structure is currently represented by 15 NATO nations, including its newest members Lithuania and Slovakia. This transformation to CC-Land HQ HD was part of a major NATO restructuring, and realized a fundamental change in headquarters mission and operations, as this headquarters turns its focus from one of six joint sub-regional command headquarters, to assume roles as one of only two land centric headquarters in the NATO command structure designed to provide expeditionary command and control at the operational level of conflict.
With this increased operational focus, there remains the critical element of promoting enhanced interoperability and standardization through provisions of land advice and guidance within Allied Command for Operations. Headquarters will also work closely with Allied Command for Transformation on aspects such as land concept development, exercises and training. Within JFC Brunssum, headquarters serves as the principal focus for all land matters. CC-Land HQ HD has conducted work in the fields of land-based operational planning, intelligence, logistics, command and control, training and exercises.
Closure.
In 2010, the US Army announced that Campbell Barracks would close, with the troop drawdown process completed by no later than 2015. NATO central army operations were relocated to Izmir, Turkey in March 2013. Flags were lowered for the last time at Campbell Barracks on 6 September 2013, with all personnel already re-located to Wiesbaden Army Airfield. According to the New York Times closure will save the Pentagon $112 million a year, mostly in costly security expenses for several scattered facilities. As the headquarters of the United States Army in Europe, the Barracks issued the orders for the millions of American soldiers — 15 million in Germany alone — who have served in Europe since 1945. The US Army is now concentrated in just five key locations in Germany, with its new European headquarters in Wiesbaden. The base will be turned over to the German government.

Victory Park, Dallas

Victory Park is a master planned development northwest of downtown Dallas, Texas (USA) and north of Spur 366 (Woodall Rodgers Freeway). It is along Interstate 35E, part of the Stemmons Corridor and Uptown.
The US$3 Billion project, at , is just north of the West End Historic District of downtown Dallas. When it is finished, the project will contain more than 4,000 residences and of office and retail space.
History.
Victory Park was developed by Ross Perot, Jr., son of billionaire tycoon Ross Perot, who was a majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA basketball team. Perot envisioned Victory Park as an "urban lifestyle destination." Anchored by the American Airlines Center, home of the Mavericks, the entire development was planned at a very detailed level by its developers.
The development has been criticized as being a "collection of imposing hyper-modern monumental structures, high-end chain stores, enormous video screens, expensive restaurants, a sports arena and tons of parking, completely isolated from the rest of the city by a pair of freeways . . . like the schizophrenic dream of some power-hungry capitalist technocrat." However, other journalists have countered this criticism of New Urbanist principles, citing that developments like Victory Park build on a classic, centuries old formula and "are not a quick fix but the slow weaving together of smart, sometimes big, often small, urban solutions" to create viable and enduring community destinations.

The Amenta

The Amenta are an Australian metal band formed in 1997 as Crucible of Agony. By 2002 the line-up was Cessium 137 (aka Mark Bevan) on lead vocals, Diazanon (Dave Haley) on drums, Ethion (Erik Miehs) on guitar, Endrin (Nathan Jenkins) on bass guitar and Chlordane (Timothy Pope) on keyboards. In 2009 the line-up had Miehs and Pope joined by Cain Cressall on vocals, Dan Quinlan on bass guitar and Robin Stone on drums. The group has issued two studio albums, "Occasus" (2004) and "n0n" (2008). In August 2012 they announced a third album, "Flesh Is Heir", was forthcoming.
History.
The Amenta originally formed in Baulkam Hills, a Sydney suburb, in 1997 as Crucible of Agony. They initially played black metal and released two demos in 1999 under that name. They were renamed as The Amenta in 2001 and, the following year, released their first extended play, "Mictlan", on Dissident Records. The line-up was Cessium 137 (aka Mark Bevan, lead vocals), Scott Howard (drums), Ethion (Erik Miehs, guitar), Endrin (Nathan Jenkins, bass guitar) and Chlordane (Timothy Pope, keyboards). Howard was soon replaced by Diazanon (Dave Haley) on drums.
In 2003 they signed with Listenable Records and followed with their debut studio album, "Occasus". It was acclaimed by rock magazine, "Kerrang!", where they were awarded Best Metal Newcomers for 2004. "Occasus" had Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia describe their sound as "a barrage of speed-riffs, crushed throat shouting, and what may or may not be programmed drums ... that recall the similarly claustrophobic crush" of bands such as Zyklon and Cryptopsy. In May 2006 the band replaced Bevan with Jarrod Krafczyk on vocals. They played several tours, including an appearance at the 2007 Festival of the Dead followed by a national tour with United Kingdom metal core bands, Akercocke and The Berzerker. Also that year, they supported Polish blackened death metal band Behemoth on their tour of Australia, and released the Virus DVD as a bonus disc with the limited re-release of "Occasus/Mictlan".
In October 2008 The Amenta issued their second album, "n0n". It features guest appearances from Jason Mendonca of Akercocke, Nergal of Behemoth, Alice Daquet of Sir Alice, and Alex Pope of Ruins. The album was described by Alex Boniwell in the magazine, "Terrorizer", as "industrial metal for people who 'actually' like both industrial and metal". Cosmo Lee of Allmusic, found the album was "futuristic yet anachronistic. Its fizzy synths, brooding soundscapes, and micro-level editing employ state-of-the-art computing. But the approach is nothing new. Whenever machines and metal intertwine this tightly, the ghost of '90s industrial metal looms large". The Amenta toured Europe in January 2009 with Deicide.
They returned to Australia and commenced a national tour with The Berzerker, which ran from late January 2009 to late March with a tour of New Zealand. The Amenta were scheduled to perform at the Rockout Festival 2009 featuring acts such as Twisted Sister, Girlschool, and Rose Tattoo, however it was postponed and ultimately cancelled. The group embarked on their first North American tour in November–December 2009 with Vader, Decrepit Birth, Warbringer, Augury and Success Will Write Apocalypse Across the Sky. They supported Behemoth and Job for a Cowboy for the 2010 Australian tour.
In 2011, The band released an online EP, "V01D" which was the band's first recordings with new vocalist Cain Cressall. It featured re-recordings of old tracks, remixes, a cover version, and a brand new song. The group embarked on an Australian tour with Ruins in March and April. Then in June they opened for Morbid Angel and later embarked on a tour to Europe with Deicide, Belphegor and Hour of Penance. In July they toured Western Australia playing material from their three albums. On 15 May 2012 The Amenta released a five-track EP, "Chokehold". In August 2012, the band's website announced that a new full-length album, "Flesh Is Heir", was forthcoming. The group was due to tour Europe in November and December of that year with Obituary, Macabre and Psycroptic.
On October 20, 2013, The Amenta announced that they would cease from performing live, and were going on an indefinite hiatus.

USS Patterson (DD-392)

USS "Patterson" (DD-392), a , was the 2nd ship of the United States Navy to be named for Daniel Todd Patterson, an officer of the US Navy that served in the Quasi-War with France, First Barbary War, and the War of 1812.
The second "Patterson" (DD-392) was laid down 23 July 1935 by the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington; launched 6 May 1937; sponsored by Miss Elizabeth P. Patterson; and commissioned 22 September 1937, Commander Francis T. Spellman in command.
Pre-war.
"Patterson" departed Puget Sound Navy Yard 26 November 1937, calling at San Francisco en route to Pearl Harbor, arriving 7 December. She returned to Puget Sound 22 December, trained in coastal waters until 31 March 1938, then cruised to Hawaii. She arrived at San Pedro from Hawaii 28 April for operations along the western seaboard and combined fleet maneuvers that once took her through the Panama Canal and into the Caribbean Sea. On 3 June 1940 she set course to patrol in the Hawaiian Sea Frontier area from Pearl Harbor to Midway and Palmyra. This duty continued for the next 18 months except for periods on the west coast for overhaul and training.
Pearl Harbor.
"Patterson" was moored at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese carrier-based planes attacked 7 December 1941. Her gunners sped to battle stations, opened fire, and blasted one enemy plane out of the sky. Within an hour the destroyermen were searching for possible enemy submarines off the harbor entrance.
"Patterson" patrolled the Hawaiian Sea Frontier in the screen of aircraft carrier Saratoga without finding trace of the enemy. On 28 December, returning from patrol, she rescued 19 survivors of merchant ship "Marimi" adrift for several days after having been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.
1942.
In the following weeks, her duties included convoy of reinforcements for the garrison on Canton Island, Phoenix Group, and hasty voyage repairs at Pearl Harbor. She departed 5 February 1942 bound in the screen of cruiser Pensacola for rendezvous with the Lexington carrier task group in the southwest Pacific. She rescued a Lexington pilot as air strikes were launched on the Japanese stronghold at Rabaul, New Britain, 20 February. The carriers rained devastation on the Japanese bases at Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea, 10 March, then proceeded to Pearl Harbor.
"Patterson" sailed from Pearl Harbor 7 April for overhaul in the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. She returned to Pearl Harbor 17 May and was underway five days later, en route by way of Noumea, New Caledonia, to join Admiral Richmond K. Turner’s Expeditionary Task Force preparing in Australia for the invasion of the Solomons. On 22 June she got underway from Brisbane for final staging and amphibious warfare rehearsals in the Fiji Islands, then set course in the screen of attack transports carrying Marines to the Solomon Islands.
Guadalcanal.
"Patterson" helped guard attack transports 7 August as they landed Marines on Guadalcanal, later opening fire to help repel more than twenty attacking horizontal bombers. Several enemy planes fell in flames. Then Japanese torpedo planes came in and hit destroyer . On 8 August "Patterson" gunners shot down four enemy torpedo planes while protecting the transports, but destroyer was damaged and transport was lost.
As "Patterson" fought off aerial raiders, seven enemy cruisers and a destroyer raced down the slot of water formed by the Solomon Islands Chain and stretching southward from the Japanese base at Rabaul. By midnight of 8 August, the Japanese task force was only 35 miles from Savo Island, having been undetected since early morning.
Battle of Savo Island.
"Patterson" was south of Savo Island and Florida Island, with a US-Australian group of three heavy cruisers and two destroyers. To their north were the heavy cruisers USS "Astoria", USS "Vincennes", USS "Quincy" and two destroyers. Driving rain slashed the waters between the northern force and ships of the southern force.
The Japanese task force slipped past two picket destroyers, entered Savo Sound, and ran head-on into "Patterson" whose patrol task group included the Allied southern group, composed of the heavy cruisers HMAS "Canberra", HMAS "Australia" and USS "Chicago", and the destroyer "Bagley". At 0143, 9 August, Patterson radioed the alarm: "Warning! Warning! Strange ships entering the harbor!" But Japanese cruisers had already launched torpedoes and opened gunfire, disabling Canberra.
"Patterson" repeated her warning by blinker and opened up her guns. She received a 5-inch return salvo from the enemy that knocked out her Number 4 gun, killed 10 men, injured eight others, and damaged the deck and the Number 3 gun.
"Patterson’s" gunners continued shooting until the enemy, flinging torpedoes, split formation, and raced northeast in a pincer movement on the northern force of three cruisers. Cruisers "Vincennes", "Astoria" and "Quincy" were lost. The Japanese now sped northward for return to Rabaul, New Britain, catching destroyer "Ralph Talbot" in her path. "Ralph Talbot" fought off the attack until she took cover in a rain-squall. The Japanese suffered only minor damage to four warships in the Battle of Savo Island that cost the Allies four cruisers, and severely damaged cruiser "Chicago" and destroyer "Ralph Talbot".
"Patterson" assisted HMAS "Australia" and HMAS "Canberra" and took part in rescue work before proceeding to Nouméa, New Caledonia, arriving 14 August. "Patterson" immediately put to sea with the "Saratoga" carrier task group to help guard the approaches to Guadalcanal, until a Japanese submarine damaged "Saratoga", and she returned to Pearl Harbor. "Patterson" helped guard HMAS "Australia" to Brisbane, arriving 3 September. She performed patrol and escort duty off the Great Barrier Reef with an Australian-American force of cruisers and destroyers.
1943.
She rescued 19 survivors of the torpedoed SS "Fingal" 5 May 1943, then escorted merchantman SS "Pennant" to Nouméa, New Caledonia, She arrived 13 May to patrol approaches to Guadalcanal in the screen of carriers Saratoga and . This duty was followed by innumerable convoy escort and patrol missions ranging from Guadalcanal south to Australian ports, and to the South Pacific island bases in the New Hebrides Islands and Nouméa, New Caledonia. The morning of 25 July, she joined four other destroyers in bombarding Lambeti Plantation, near the Munda air strip on New Georgia Island.
The evening of 25 August Patterson was helping guard a convoy bound from the New Hebrides Islands toward the lower Solomons. A warning pip on her radar screen brought her into action against a diving Japanese submarine. Her sonar picked up the underwater enemy and depth charge patterns exploded in the sea. "Patterson" sent her last depth charge barrage on its way, and five minutes later she was rewarded by a deep underseas boom, presumably silencing the enemy.
"Patterson" next escorted troop transports from Nouméa, New Caledonia, to the New Hebrides, patrolled off Guadalcanal out of Purvis Bay, Florida, Solomon Islands. The night of 24 September she helped guard an amphibious landing convoy to Vella Lavella Island, then departed to escort high speed transports to Rendova Island. She soon turned back to Vella Lavella Island at full speed, having received word that unloading tank landing craft there were under enemy air attack. The attack had ceased by the time she reached the scene but she launched motor whaleboats with medical and rescue parties to aid the wounded.
The night of 29/30 September "Patterson" proceeded up the slot to destroy enemy barge traffic. Destroyer "McCalla", after ripping into radar contacts with gunfire, attempted to rejoin the destroyer task unit formation, but suffered a steering casualty and unavoidably collided into the port bow of "Patterson". Three men in "Patterson" were killed and ten injured by the force of the collision that almost severed "Patterson’s" bow. The broken section parted as she slowly proceeded towards base, breaking off just forward of gun mount No. 1. Both ships entered Purvis Bay for emergency repairs, thence to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides Islands where "Patterson" received a false bow. On 6 December she put to sea, touching the Samoan and Hawaiian Islands en route to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, arriving 22 December.
1944.
"Patterson" stood out of San Francisco Bay 8 March 1944 with a convoy that entered Pearl Harbor 15 March. Training with fast attack carriers in Hawaiian waters was followed by similar battle rehearsals out of Marshall Island ports in preparation for the Marianas Campaign. On 6 June Patterson departed Majuro Atoll en route to Saipan with the "Bunker Hill" Carrier Task Group. She joined in the preinvasion bombardment of Saipan, then guarded troop transports sending in assault troops for the initial invasion of Saipan 15 June. On approach of the Japanese Mobile Fleet, she became a unit of the anti-aircraft screen around the Fast Carrier Task Force whose pilots shot down hundreds of Japanese carrier-based planes, in a series of actions known as the “Great Marianas Turkey Shoot,” before they could reach the American Fleet.
The few enemy planes that managed to get past the American carrier pilots met curtains of anti-aircraft fire from Patterson and her sister ships. The destroyer helped guard American attack carriers through 21 June as they pursued the fleeing Japanese fleet, decisively defeated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, then turned back to help protect the approaches to Saipan. She provided night illumination fire for advancing troops on Saipan, then bombarded enemy targets on nearby Tinian Island.
Bombardment support and anti-submarine patrol continued off Saipan and Tinian until 9 August. "Patterson" then called briefly at Apra Harbor, Guam, en route to Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshalls. There, she joined the screen of fast carriers that struck hard at enemy bases on Iwo Jima and in the Western Caroline Islands. She participated in the bombardment of Yap Island 8 September. From there she proceeded to the Palau Islands to guard fast carriers giving direct support to the landing troops there until 9 October.
After replenishment at Manus, Admiralty Islands, "Patterson" made a high-speed run with attack carriers to blast enemy defenses on Okinawa and the entire Kerama Retto chain. From there the fast carrier task forces approached the Philippines to rain destruction on enemy air installations in Northern Luzon, thence proceeded to the coast of Formosa for air strikes launched 12 October. That evening and through the following day, Patterson helped fight off and destroy enemy aerial raiders that approached her carrier task group.
From Formosa, the carriers sped back to Luzon where "Patterson" helped drive off attacking enemy dive bombers that made a near miss on carrier "Franklin". On 20 October her carrier task group gave direct air support to troops landing at Leyte to begin the liberation of the Philippine Islands. As the Japanese Fleet approached the Philippines in a three-pronged attack, 24–25 October, her carrier task force hit hard at the Japanese Southern Force of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, struck at the even more powerful Japanese Central Force aiming at the Central Philippines, then raced north to destroy the Japanese decoy carrier task force in the Battle off Cape Enganno, 25 October. She joined in the pursuit of enemy fleet units fleeing the Battle for Leyte Gulf, then helped fight off the suicide attacks of Japanese kamikaze aircraft 30 October. She rescued men blown into the water from the damaged carriers "Franklin" and "Belleau Wood", escorting the damaged carriers safely to Ulithi in the Caroline Islands, arriving 3 November.
"Patterson" helped protect attack carriers providing air cover to convoys approaching the Philippines until 9 December. She then proceeded independently to Kossol Roads, Palau Islands. There, she joined the screen of an escort carrier-bombardment task group that sailed 10 December to provide heavy gunfire support and air cover for the initial landings on Mindoro Island. For seven days the destroyer remained in the Sulu Sea, fighting off frequent suicide attacks of enemy aerial raiders that closed her carrier task group formation. There was a brief replenishment at Palau before Patterson again sailed with escort aircraft carriers, this time to support the invasion landings at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, Philippines.
1945.
She rescued survivors of the kamikaze-damaged escort carrier "Ommaney Bay" 4 January 1945, and survivors of destroyer "Stafford" and escort carrier "Manila Bay" the following day. She shot down a suicide plane diving on carrier "Salamaua" 13 January, remaining on guard for carriers in support of the Lingayen Gulf invasion landings until the 17th. She then proceeded to Ulithi in the Carolines to prepare for the impending invasion of Iwo Jima.
"Patterson" departed Ulithi 10 February for final battle rehearsals and staging in the Marianas, thence in the screen of escort carriers covering the amphibious expeditionary troops for the landings on Iwo Jima, 19 February. She rescued 106 survivors of the escort carrier Bismarck Sea, sunk by enemy torpedo plane attacks off Iwo Jima 21 February. The fighting destroyer remained off Iwo Jima with escort carriers until 10 March, then set course for Ulithi to prepare for the capture and occupation of Okinawa, the “last stepping stone” to Japan.
"Patterson" sailed from Ulithi the morning of 21 March, en route with a support unit of seven escort aircraft carriers that gave direct cover to troops storming ashore at Okinawa 1 April. She shot down an enemy suicide plane that attacked escort carrier Lunga Point 2 April and continued to guard the escort carriers as they pounded enemy troop concentrations and installations through 29 April. When her sonar gear became inoperative 29 April, she set course for repairs at Apra Harbor, Guam. She put to sea from Apra Harbor 4 June, escorting battleship "New Mexico" as far as Leyte in the Philippines, There she joined a troop and supply reinforcement convoy bound to Kerama Retto. By 12 June she had rejoined the escort carriers giving direct support to troops until the bitter contest for Okinawa was won.
"Patterson" returned to Leyte for repairs then headed for Saipan, Mariana Islands. This was her base for escort-patrol missions reaching to Okinawa, Guam, and towards the Marshalls until the close of hostilities with Japan.
Post-war.
On 16 August she departed Saipan as escort for battleship "New Jersey" bound to Manila, thence to Buckner Bay, Okinawa. She departed Buckner Bay 8 September, touching Saipan, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor, en route to San Diego, California, arriving 26 September. The following day she got underway to transit the Panama Canal for the eastern seaboard. She arrived in the New York Naval Shipyard 11 October and decommissioned there 8 November 1945. She remained in reserve until her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 25 February 1947. She was sold for scrapping 18 August 1947 to the Northern Metals Co., Philadelphia, Pa.
"Patterson" received 13 battle stars for World War II service.

Skomorokh

The skomorokhs (sing. скоморох in Russian, скоморохъ in Old East Slavic, скоморaхъ in Church Slavonic) were medieval East Slavic harlequins, i.e. actors, who could also sing, dance, play musical instruments and compose for their oral/musical and dramatic performances. The etymology of the word is not completely clear. There are hypotheses that the word is derived from the Greek σκώμμαρχος (cf. σκῶμμα, "joke"); from the Italian "scaramuccia" ("joker", cf. English "scaramouch"); from the Arabic "masẋara"; and many others.
The skomorokhs appeared in Kievan Rus no later than the mid-11th century although fresco depictions of skomorokh musicians in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev dated to the 11th century.
The "Primary Chronicle" data about skomorokhi concurs with the period. The monk chronicler denounced the skomorokhi as devil servants. Furthermore the Orthodox Church often railed against the skomorokhi and other elements of popular culture as being irreverent, detracting from the worship of God, or even downright diabolical. For example Theodosius of Kiev, one of the co-founders of the Caves Monastery in the eleventh century, called the skomorokhi "evils to be shunned by good Christians". Their art was related and addressed to the common people and usually opposed the ruling groups who considered them not just useless but ideologically detrimental and dangerous by both the feudalists and the clergy.
Skomorokhi were persecuted in the years of the Mongol yoke when the church strenuously propagated ascetic living. The skomorokh art reached its peak in the 15th–17th century. Their repertoire included mock songs, dramatic and satirical sketches called "glumy" (глумы) performed in masks and skomorokh dresses to the sounds of domra, balalaika, gudok, bagpipes or buben (a kind of tambourine). The appearance of Russian puppet theatre was directly associated with skomorokh performances.
The skomorokhs performed in the streets and city squares engaging with the spectators to draw them into their play. Usually the main character of the skomorokh performance was a fun-loving saucy "muzhik" (мужик) of comic simplicity. In the 16th–17th century the skomorokhs would sometimes combine their efforts and perform in a "vataga" (ватага, or big crowd) numbering 70 to 100 people. The skomorokhs were often persecuted by the Russian Orthodox Church and civilian authorities. 
In 1648 and 1657, Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich issued ukases banning the skomorokh art as blasphemous but the actors would still occasionally perform during popular celebrations. In the 18th century the skomorokh art gradually died away; passing on some of its traditions to the "balagans" (балаган) and "rayoks" (раёк).

USS Jarvis (DD-393)

USS "Jarvis" (DD-393), a "Bagley"-class destroyer, was the 2nd ship of the United States Navy to be named for James C. Jarvis, a U.S. Navy midshipman who was killed at the age of 13 during the Quasi-War with France.
She saw service in the Pacific in the early months of World War II, and participated in the invasion of Guadalcanal.
She was sunk to the south of Guadalcanal on the 9th August, 1942, with all hands - the only American surface warship to be lost in WWII with no survivors.
Construction.
The second "Jarvis" (DD-393) was laid down by Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, 21 August 1935; launched 6 May 1937; sponsored by Mrs Thomas T. Craven, wife of Vice Admiral Craven; and commissioned 27 October 1937, Lieutenant Commander R. R. Ferguson in command.
Pre-war.
Clearing Puget Sound 4 January 1938, "Jarvis" operated along the California coast and in the Caribbean until 1 April 1940 when she departed San Diego for fleet exercises off the Hawaiian Islands. She arrived Pearl Harbor 26 April, cruised the Pacific to Midway and Johnston Islands, and steamed to San Francisco 8 February 1941 for overhaul. Returning to Pearl Harbor 17 April to commence more than seven months of intensive maneuvers as part of Destroyer Division Eight (DesDiv 8) of Destroyer Squadron Four, she put into Pearl Harbor 4 December following exercises off Maui Island.
Attack on Pearl Harbor.
Three days later the Japanese executed the carefully planned, devastating attack on Pearl Harbor. Moored next to "Mugford" (DD-389) in berth B6 of the Navy yard for minor repairs, "Jarvis" opened fire with 5-inch guns and machine guns and made preparations to get underway. Within minutes of the initial attack, her 5-inch guns were among the first to challenge the enemy raiders, and her gunners proudly claimed four planes. As the first wave of enemy bombers raked Battleship Row with torpedoes and bombs, Ensign W. F. Greene laconically appraised the situation with the following entry in "Jarvis"' Deck Log: "0758 Hostilities with Japan commenced with air raid on Pearl Harbor. Went to General Quarters." Emerging from the attack with no loss of crew and only superficial damage, Jarvis sortied that morning with several cruisers and destroyers to conduct surveillance and ASW patrols.
First war cruises.
On the 16th she cleared Pearl Harbor with "Saratoga" (CV-3) and joined Task Force 14, steaming to relieve the beleaguered defenders on Wake Atoll. Recalled to Pearl Harbor 23 December, after the rescue mission aborted, Jarvis returned the 29th to resume ASW patrols. While operating with "Lexington" (CV-2) and her screening cruisers, Jarvis rescued 182 survivors of the stricken fleet oiler "Neches" (AO-5) 6 hours after she was torpedoed during mid-watch 23 January 1942.
"Jarvis" departed Pearl Harbor 5 February to escort a convoy to Brisbane, Australia. Following her return 27 March, she sailed 8 April for San Francisco to undergo alterations with the other ships of DesRon Four. She returned to Pearl 18 May escorting 13 ships and proceeded 5 days later via Fiji to Sydney, Australia. Arriving 18 June, she commenced convoy escort and ASW patrols from Australia to New Caledonia, continuing this duty until called to participate in the invasion of Guadalcanal.
Guadalcanal campaign.
Steaming from Sydney on the 14th July, "Jarvis" arrived in Wellington, New Zealand, on the 19th to join Task Force 62, which sailed on the 22nd July for the Solomons. After conducting rehearsal landings in the Fiji Islands 28–30 July, the invasion force of 84 ships and 20,000 marines steamed for Guadalcanal 31 July. Protected from Japanese search planes by rain and heavy mists, the force arrived off the landing beaches at dawn 7 August.
Following naval and air bombardment of enemy defenses, the first amphibious operation of the war commenced at 0650. "Jarvis" patrolled watchfully as part of the protective screen while Marines established a beachhead. As landing operations progressed, Americans expected the Japanese to strike vigorously at the transports with land-based planes. However, during two attacks which occurred that afternoon the Americans sustained only minor damage on "Mugford" (DD-389) while splashing 14 enemy planes.
Following night patrol off the southern end of Savo Island, Jarvis returned to Lunga Point to screen the unloading transports. Warning of an impending air attack suspended these operations; and the transports and their protective screen of destroyers and cruisers deployed in the body of water between Guadalcanal and Florida Island, soon to be called "Ironbottom Sound". When enemy torpedo bombers appeared about noon 8 August, they met a lethal stream of antiaircraft fire. Only 9 of the 26 planes penetrated the defensive fire, but they set "George F. Elliott" (AP-13) ablaze and torpedoed "Jarvis".
Torpedoed.
With 5-inch shells and machine gun fire pouring out at the attackers, "Jarvis" maneuvered between "Vincennes" (CA-44) and one of the planes during the thick of the fight. As antiaircraft fire consumed the plane, its torpedo exploded against "Jarvis"' starboard side near the forward fireroom, stopping her dead in the water and killing 14 crewmen. Her crew jettisoned the port torpedoes and quickly brought under control the fires that followed the explosion. "Dewey" (DD-349) towed her to shallow anchorage off Lunga Point; and, after the attack, she crossed "Iron-bottom Sound" to Tulagi, where she transferred her seven wounded and commenced emergency repairs.
Despite a 50-foot gash in her side, she was considered seaworthy and ordered to proceed under cover of darkness to Efate, New Hebrides, escorted by the minesweeper "Hovey". Apparently unaware of the order because her radios had been disabled, her skipper, Lt. Comdr. William W. Graham Jr., decided to steam to Sydney, Australia, for immediate repairs from "Dobbin" (AD-3). Unnoticed by her own ships, "Jarvis" departed Tulagi at midnight 9 August and moved slowly westward through "Ironbottom Sound" and between Savo Island and Cape Esperance. At 0134 she passed 3,000 yards northward of Rear Admiral Mikawa's cruisers, steaming to meet the Americans at the costly Battle of Savo Island. Mistaking her for a cruiser of the New Zealand "Achilles"-class, they fired torpedoes, and destroyer "Yūnagi" later engaged her briefly, all without effect.
The destroyer, continuing to retire westward, had little speed, no radio communications, and few operative guns; but she refused aid from "Blue" (DD-387) upon being sighted at 0325. After daybreak a "Saratoga"-based scout plane sighted her 40 miles off Guadalcanal, trailing fuel oil and down by the bow. That was the last time Americans saw her.
Loss of Jarvis.
The Japanese, however, still mistaking "Jarvis" for an escaping cruiser, dispatched 31 planes from Rabaul to search out and destroy her. Once discovered, the determined, but badly damaged, destroyer was no match for bombers raking the ship with bullets and torpedoes. According to Japanese records, "Jarvis" "split and sank" at 1300 on 9 August. None of her 233 remaining crew survived the onslaught.
"Jarvis" received three battle stars for World War II service.

Chawda dynasty

The Chavda dynasty (Chawda, Chavada, Chapa, Chaparana, Chapokata) was a Hindu Kshatriya family line that ruled northern Gujarat from 746 to 942. The members seem to have been one of the ruling clans of the Gurjars.
History.
There were five Chavda kings after Vanraj. The last king Samantsinh Chavda did not have any children so he adopted his nephew Mulraj Solanki who overthrew him in 942 and set up what came to be known as the Solanki dynasty. 
In Saurahstra, Chavda kings once held sway over Port of Diu, Dwarka, Wadhwan, Prabhash Patan, Shiyalbet, Harshad (Minalpur), Chorwad, Koylana-Ghed, okha etc. Further, Varsoda Principality in Gujarat was ruled by Chavda kings until independence of India.

Center for Immigration Studies

The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) is a nonpartisan, politically conservative non-profit research organization that advocates immigration reduction in the United States. It was started as a spin-off from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) in 1985. As a 501(c)(3) organization, it is subject to limits or absolute prohibitions on engaging in political activities. The CIS's self-described mission is to "providimmigration policymakers, the academic community, news media, and concerned citizens with reliable information about the social, economic, environmental, security, and fiscal consequences of legal and illegal immigration into the United States."
Board and funding.
The founding CIS Board Members were:
Several of the founding members are still on the Board, which is headed by former U.S. Attorney Peter Nunez and includes T. Willard Fair from the Urban League of Greater Miami.
Funding comes from contributions and grants by private foundations, from contracts with the Census Bureau and Department of Justice, and from donations by individuals, including donations made through the Combined Federal Campaign.
Publications.
CIS publishes books and posts for free on its website a variety of announcements, research reports, memoranda, op-eds and articles, panel discussion transcripts, Congressional testimony, and videos. It also maintains a blog. The organization's publications address topics relating to both illegal and legal immigration.
Congressional testimony.
The Center's staff have been called on to give testimony before federal and state legislators dozens of times and on numerous subjects within the realm of immigration. In 2006 and 2007, as the U.S. Congress took up comprehensive immigration reform, they gave Congressional testimony on 27 different occasions.
Supreme Court Citation.
The Center's research was cited by Justice Kennedy in his opinion in "Arizona v. United States", on June 25, 2012, as evidence of Arizona's problem with crime committed by illegal aliens.
Policy Stances.
Attrition through enforcement.
The Center advocates a policy called "attrition through enforcement". Mark Krikorian, executive director of the CIS, described the policy as:
Shrink the illegal population through consistent, across-the-board enforcement of the immigration law. By deterring the settlement of new illegals, by increasing deportations to the extent possible, and, most importantly, by increasing the number of illegals already here who give up and deport themselves, the United States can bring about an annual decrease in the illegal-alien population, rather than allowing it to continually increase. The point, in other words, is not merely to curtail illegal immigration, but rather to bring about a steady reduction in the total number of illegal immigrants who are living in the United States. The result would be a shrinking of the illegal population to a manageable nuisance, rather than today's looming crisis.
Krikorian wrote in 2005 that the Center does not advocate amnesty for illegal aliens or mass deportations, because the two represent, "a false premise: Since the federal government can't quickly deport the 10-12 million illegal aliens, the only alternative is legalization – i.e., amnesty."
Krikorian said that he rejects the plausibility of mass deportations for three main reasons:
E-Verify.
E-Verify is currently a voluntary program run by the United States government to help companies determine whether employees and prospective employees are legally authorized to work in the United States. Formerly known as the Basic Pilot/Employment Eligibility Verification Program, the program is operated by the Department of Homeland Security in partnership with the Social Security Administration.
A 2008 white paper by the Center made several assertions about the E-Verify program, including the following:
The author of the study, former 9/11 Commission staffer Janice Kephart, said:
E-Verify replaced a paper-based system that employers incessantly moaned about for good reason. Even after Sept. 11, 2001, employers were in a no-win situation with the federal government; they faced an immigration law rightly forbidding the hiring of illegal workers but had to rely on a paper-based system which couldn't verify the identities or documents of new hires.
Then, with the creation of E-Verify in 2004, the main burden for determining work authorization shifted to the government in a meaningful way, modernizing what was known as the Basic Pilot Program.
US-Visit.
US-VISIT is a U.S. immigration and border management system. The system involves the collection and analysis of biometric data (such as fingerprints), which are checked against a database to track individuals deemed by the United States to be terrorists, criminals, and illegal immigrants.
A 2005 Center Backgrounder was critical of the program. Specifically, it said that that most Mexican and Canadian arrivals are not checked and the exit checks are extremely sparse. Since that time, the number of checks increased, but the Center has asserted that much more work is needed. The author of the report, former Foreign Service Officer Jessica Vaughan, said: 
Lack of attention to the overstay problem continues to compromise our efforts to prevent terrorist operations and control illegal immigration. At the moment, in a dangerous international environment, we are admitting about 200 million temporary visitors a year, with virtually no way to keep visitors from staying beyond their authorized visit, and no way even to count the number of visitors who overstay. DHS estimates that at least 30 percent of the approximately 10 million illegal immigrants living in the United States are probably visa overstayers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) says that figure is almost certainly understated, probably significantly so.
Population and the environment.
The Center has asserted that there are adverse effects of immigration on the environment.
A web video series, published by the Center, asserted that illegal immigrant smuggling along the southern U.S. border has caused environmental damage. The hidden cameras and other footage in the video series were asserted to show that various smuggling routes through federal lands in southern Arizona have encroached on wildlife areas and left trash and other pollution behind.
The Center also asserted that legal and illegal immigration have an adverse impact due to increasing the nation's population. The center said that if current immigration policies are held in place, future immigrants and their descendants would increase the U.S. population by approximately 100 million people over the next fifty years. The center said that this would cause an increase in CO2 releases and other ecological damage.
Katz award.
The Center gives an annual award called the Katz award to journalists covering immigration issues. The organization's stated purpose for the award is, "to promote informed and fair reporting on this contentious and complicated issue." The award is named in memory of Eugene Katz, a native New Yorker who started his career as a reporter for the "Daily Oklahoman". In 1928, he joined the family business, working as an advertising salesman for the Katz Agency, and in 1952 became president of Katz Communications, a half-billion-dollar firm which not only dealt in radio and television advertising but also owned and managed a number of radio stations. Katz was a member of the Center for Immigration Studies board until shortly after his 90th birthday in 1997. He died in 2000.
Katz award recipients have included the following:
Criticism.
Southern Poverty Law Center.
The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published reports in 2002 and 2009 claiming to connect CIS to John Tanton, who helped found various other organizations, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and NumbersUSA, and alleging that he has ties to white supremacy groups and a eugenics foundation.
The SPLC's 2009 report charged: 
FAIR, CIS and NumbersUSA are all part of a network of
restrictionist organizations conceived and created by John
Tanton, the "puppeteer" of the nativist movement and a man
with deep racist roots ... CIS was conceived by Tanton and began life as a program of FAIR. CIS presents itself as a scholarly think tank that produces serious immigration studies meant to serve "the broad national interest." But the reality is that CIS has never found any aspect of immigration that it liked, and it has frequently manipulated
data to achieve the results it seeks.
In response, Krikorian wrote:
The fact that they went after mainstream groups rather than fringe ones shows that the goal is not elevating the tone of public discourse but shutting it down altogether. ... The report's section on CIS is not just hackwork, but amateurish hackwork. Much of it dwells on letters written to (not by, but "to") one of my board members, misidentified as having been executive director. Our research is described as having been debunked by "mainstream think tanks and organizations," oddly enough including two of the most strident open-borders advocacy groups in the nation. My tenure there, the majority of the center's existence, is dismissed briefly at the end as "The Later Years." And they didn’t even mention my book, which knits together decades of CIS research on the many facets of immigration into a unified theoretical framework–-something at least worth touching on when trying to show how naughty CIS is. What's more, CIS is an unlikely source of "intolerance." The chairman is Peter Nuñez, U.S. attorney for San Diego under Reagan; the board includes the president of the Greater Miami Urban League and a former executive director of the National Black Caucus Foundation; the staff includes the former national policy director for the American Jewish Committee; and I didn't even speak English until I got to kindergarten.
Tanton also denied the SPLC's accusations. As to his alleged influence at CIS, he wrote, "I also helped raise a grant in 1985 for the Center for Immigration Studies, but I have played no role in the Center's growth or development." Tanton also challenged the SPLC to a public debate at the National Press Club.
In March 2010, CIS published a report written by Jerry Kammer, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist, and senior research fellow at CIS, that was sharply critical of the SPLC, its tactics and methodologies, and its attacks against groups such as CIS, NumbersUSA, and FAIR. "Rather than engage in a debate, La Raza and its allies have waged a campaign to have the other side shunned by the press, civil society, and elected officials. It is an effort to destroy the reputations of its targets. It also seeks to intimidate and coerce others into silence. It undermines basic principles of civil society and democratic discussion." A corresponding panel discussion at the National Press Club was moderated by Krikorian and included Kammer, Krikorian, "Harper's" editor Ken Silverstein, and Vanderbilt University Professor Carol M. Swain.
"Wall Street Journal".
In 2004, a "Wall Street Journal" editorial repeated the SPLC's allegation that CIS is part of a network of organizations founded by Tanton and also charged that these organizations are "trying to stop immigration to the U.S." It quoted Chris Cannon, at the time a Republican U.S. Representative from Utah, as saying, "Tanton set up groups like CIS and FAIR to take an analytical approach to immigration from a Republican point of view so that they can give cover to Republicans who oppose immigration for other reasons."
Several months earlier, Krikorian denied allegations made in a similarly critical "Wall Street Journal" editorial and by Rep. Cannon, writing "This kind of venomous lying and guilt by association are par for the course in the fever swamps of the web, but are startling in the halls of the U.S. Congress and the pages of the nation's largest-circulation newspaper."
Although former Rep. Cannon expressed a negative view of CIS, the CIS website quotes other elected officials, including U.S. Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX), former Governor Richard D. Lamm (D-CO), U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), and former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), in support of the organization.

Microsoft Assistance Markup Language

Microsoft Assistance Markup Language (Microsoft AML, generally referred to as MAML) is an XML-based markup language developed by the Microsoft User Assistance Platform team to provide user assistance ("online help") for the Microsoft Windows Vista operating system. MAML is also used to provide help information for PowerShell Cmdlets, modules and advanced functions. 
MAML is a departure from all previous types of user assistance for Windows operating systems. Some of its features have been available in .NET Framework 2, but more options shipped with the release of .NET Framework 3. Previously, user assistance for Windows operating systems used files created with a command line compiler (hhc.exe). This compiler is used to compile a .hhp (project) file, .hhc (table of contents) file, .hhk (index) file, and a collection of HTML topic files and the related resources (CSS, JavaScript, and image files) into one .chm file. 
The most significant aspect of MAML is that it shifts the production of user assistance to the concept of structured authoring (somewhat similar to DITA or DocBook). Documents and their constituent elements are defined by their context. With MAML, the emphasis is on content and the tasks a user performs with a computer, not the features of the software. Presentation is managed as part of the rendering engine when a user requests a topic.
The MAML authoring structure is divided into segments related to a type of content: conceptual, FAQ, glossary, procedure, reference, reusable content, task, troubleshooting, and tutorial. At present, there are no Microsoft released automated tools to assist in the creation of MAML - you need to create the XML files by hand.
Three levels of transformation occur when a topic is displayed: structure, presentation, and rendering: 
Unfortunately, there is no decent tool available for IT Pros to author MAML. You can use Notepad (which is pretty tedious). James O'Neil (former MSFT employee) shows you how you can use InfoPath to author this information (see: http://blogs.technet.com/b/jamesone/archive/2009/07/24/powershell-on-line-help-a-change-you-should-make-for-v2-3-and-how-to-author-maml-help-files-for-powershell.aspx) but this is far from perfect as his article suggests.

Antonio Mancini

Antonio Mancini (14 November 1852 – 28 December 1930) was an Italian painter.
Biography.
Mancini was born in Rome and showed precocious ability as an artist. At the age of twelve, he was admitted to the Institute of Fine Arts in Naples, where he studied under Domenico Morelli (1823–1901), a painter of historical scenes who favored dramatic chiaroscuro and vigorous brushwork, and Filippo Palizzi. Mancini developed quickly under their guidance, and in 1872, he exhibited two paintings at the Paris Salon.
Mancini worked at the forefront of the "Verismo" movement, an indigenous Italian response to 19th-century Realist aesthetics. His usual subjects included children of the poor, juvenile circus performers, and musicians he observed in the streets of Naples. His portrait of a young acrobat in"Il Saltimbanco" (1877–78) exquisitely captures the fragility of the boy whose impoverished childhood is spent entertaining pedestrian crowds. 
While in Paris in the 1870s, Mancini met the Impressionist painters Edgar Degas and Édouard Manet. He became friends with John Singer Sargent, who famously pronounced him to be the greatest living painter. His mature works show a brightened palette with a striking impasto technique on canvas and a bold command of pastels on paper.
In 1881, Mancini suffered a disabling mental illness. He settled in Rome in 1883 for twenty years, then moved to Frascati where he lived until 1918. During this period of Mancini's life, he was often destitute and relied on the help of friends and art buyers to survive. After the First World War, his living situation stabilized and he achieved a new level of serenity in his work. Mancini died in Rome in 1930 and buried in the Basilica Santi Bonifacio e Alessio on the Aventine Hill.
His painting,"The Poor Schoolboy", exhibited in the Salon of 1876, is displayed in the Musee d'Orsay of Paris. Its realist subject matter and dark palette are typical of his early work. Paintings by Mancini also may be seen in Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea in Rome, the Museo Civico-Galleria d'Arte Moderna in Turin, and other galleries in Italy. 
The first exhibition in the U.S. devoted exclusively to Mancini's work was at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, October 20, 2007 – January 20, 2008. The Philadelphia Art Museum holds fifteen oil paintings and three pastels by Mancini that were a gift of New York art dealer Vance N. Jordan.

César De Paepe

César De Paepe (12 July 1841 in Ostend, Belgium - 1890 in Cannes, France) was a medical doctor and a prominent syndicalist whose work strongly influenced the Industrial Workers of the World and the syndicalist movement in general. Anticipating modern political philosophy, democracy according to de Paepe would inevitably spread to the economic segments of society and economic organizations: workplace democracy was inevitable. He graduated in medicine at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles.
De Paepe was a leading member of the First International and was the principal leader of the Collectivist victory over the supporters of Proudhonian mutualism, like Henri Tolain, at the 1868 Brussels conference. Initially siding with the anti-Marxist side of the 1872 split, his subsequent debates with the anarchists of the Jura Federation such as Paul Brousse and Adhémar Schwitzguébel over the "Public Service Question" led him to defend the necessity of a workers' state to provide social services like a public health service.
At the end of 1877 De Paepe, Joseph Favre, Benoît Malon and Ippolito Perderzolli co-founded the review "Le Socialisme progressif" in Switzerland.
Twenty three issues appeared between 7 January and 30 November 1878.
Favre, Malon, Lodovico Nabruzzi and Tito Zanardelli had earlier founded the internationalist section of Lake Lugano. They rejected insurrection in favor of evolutionary solutions, and supported trade unions.
Because he flourished after the Communist Manifesto but before World War I, de Paepe's views are inevitably compared to those of Karl Marx. De Paepe was notably neutral on the question of a violent worker revolution by the proletariat. He thought it was possible, and maybe desirable in some countries, but that a slow gradual advancement of democratic values and norms in workplaces would have a pacifying effect and eventually make the methods by which the ruling class ruled obsolete: once everyone was a manager, management would lose mystique, just as once everyone could vote, political leadership had also.

Gateway to the Savage Frontier

Gateway to the Savage Frontier (1991) is a Gold Box Dungeons and Dragons computer game developed by Stormfront Studios and published by SSI for the Commodore 64, PC and Amiga personal computers. The title was the #1 selling game in North America in August 1991.
Development.
When SSI began work on the Dark Sun game engine in 1989 after the completion of Secret of the Silver Blades, they passed responsibility for continuing the Forgotten Realms Gold Box games to Stormfront. Designers Don Daglow, Mark Buchignani, David Bunnett, Arturo Sinclair and Mark Manyen set the action for the game in an area of the Forgotten Realms that TSR had labeled "The Savage Frontier", north of Waterdeep and south of Luskan along the Sword Coast. The area was far to the west of the region that hosted the action for Pool of Radiance and its sequels.
One of the major locations in the Savage Frontier, Neverwinter, spun off a new chapter. Stormfront gained the support of AOL executive Steve Case to create the first-ever graphical MMORPG, and to base it on the Gold Box engine. To leverage the existing game and cross-promote the titles, Daglow based the new MMORPG in Neverwinter and named it "Neverwinter Nights".
The game's principal technical enhancement to the aging Gold Box engine was the addition of "wilderness play", where the party traveled long distances on the map while following the basic D&D rules for combat with wandering monsters.
The game also featured character-specific side-quests, with two NPCs who can open these optional missions. The side quests in turn open different endings for the game.
Plot Overview.
The game revolves around a standard (for Gold Box adventures) party of six adventurers who inadvertently get caught up in a plot by the Zhentarim to conquer the entire Frontier area.
The storyline, in rough terms, follows:
Basically, Zhentil Keep plans to use these magical statues to open a way through an otherwise-unpassable desert for their armies. If successful, the party is hailed as the "Heroes of Ascore," which is carried over into the sequel.
Sequels.
The game spawned one sequel, "Treasures of the Savage Frontier" (1992).
Reception.
The game was reviewed in 1992 in "Dragon" #177 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.
According to GameSpy, "it was a polished revision of what the early games in the Gold Box series were like, and felt very welcome, to those who'd gotten a bit weary of the far-flung conventions of its most recent installments".

Tetrahemihexahedron

In geometry, the tetrahemihexahedron or hemicuboctahedron is a uniform star polyhedron, indexed as U4. It has 6 vertices and 12 edges, and 7 faces: 4 triangular and 3 square. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral. Its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram is (although this is a double covering of the tetrahemihexahedron).
It is the only non-prismatic uniform polyhedron with an odd number of faces. Its Wythoff symbol is 3/2 3 | 2, but actually that represents a double covering of the tetrahemihexahedron with 8 triangles and 6 squares, paired and coinciding in space. (It can more intuitively be seen as two coinciding tetrahemihexahedra.)
It is a hemipolyhedron. The "hemi" part of the name means some of the faces form a group with half as many members as some regular polyhedron—here, three square faces form a group with half as many faces as the regular hexahedron, better known as the cube—hence "hemihexahedron". Hemi faces are also oriented in the same direction as the regular polyhedron's faces. The three square faces of the tetrahemihexahedron are, like the three facial orientations of the cube, mutually perpendicular.
The "half-as-many" characteristic also means that hemi faces must pass through the center of the polyhedron, where they all intersect each other. Visually, each square is divided into four right triangles, with two visible from each side.
It is the three-dimensional demicross polytope.
Related surfaces.
It is a non-orientable surface. It is unique as the only uniform polyhedron with an Euler characteristic of 1 and is hence a projective polyhedron, yielding a representation of the real projective plane very similar to the "Roman surface".
Related polyhedra.
It has the same vertices and edges as the regular octahedron. It also shares 4 of the 8 triangular faces of the octahedron, but has three additional square faces passing through the centre of the polyhedron.
The dual figure is the tetrahemihexacron.
It is 2-covered by the cuboctahedron, which accordingly has the same abstract vertex figure (2 triangles and two squares: 3.4.3.4) and twice the vertices, edges, and faces.
It may also be constructed as a crossed triangular cuploid, being a reduced version of the {3/2}-cupola (retrograde triangular cupola, ratricu) by its {6/2}-gonal base.
Tetrahemihexacron.
The tetrahemihexacron is the dual of the tetrahemihexahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra.
Since the hemipolyhedra have faces passing through the center, the dual figures have corresponding vertices at infinity; properly, on the real projective plane at infinity. In Magnus Wenninger's "Dual Models", they are represented with intersecting prisms, each extending in both directions to the same vertex at infinity, in order to maintain symmetry. In practice the model prisms are cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker. Wenninger suggested these figures are members of a new class of stellation figures, called "stellation to infinity". However, he also suggested that strictly speaking they are not polyhedra because their construction does not conform to the usual definitions.
Topologically it is considered to contain seven vertices. The three vertices considered at infinity (the real projective plane at infinity) correspond directionally to the three vertices of the hemi-octahedron, an abstract polyhedron. The other four vertices exist at alternate corners of a central cube (a demicube, in this case a tetrahedron).

Norge, Virginia

Norge is an unincorporated community in James City County, Virginia, United States.
Location.
Norge was located on the old Richmond-Williamsburg Stage Road, which is U.S. Route 60 in modern times. Interstate 64 was built through the area in the 1970s, and passes nearby. Exit 231 is labeled "Croaker-Norge" for the two small communities nearby.
History.
The new community of Norge was formally established beginning in 1904 in western James City County by Norwegian-Americans and other Scandinavians, with persons resettling from other places in North America joined by new immigrants. The word "Norge" is the Norwegian (Bokmål) spelling of "Norway". Land at Norge was reasonably priced and offered rich farm land in a gentler climate than that of the northern and Midwestern states, where some of the immigrants had originally settled upon coming to America.
For some years, prospective new residents were introduced to the area through promotional material sent out by Carl Martin Bergh, a fellow Norwegian-American with farming experience who had become a land agent for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O). The Peninsula Extension of the railroad had been built through the area in 1881 to reach from the mountains of West Virginia to the coal piers on Hampton Roads at the new city of Newport News in adjacent Warwick County. Originally known as "Vaiden's Siding", the C&O built a railroad station at Norge in 1908. The Norge Depot offered a convenient point for shipping farm produce to places such as Richmond. 
Although the railroad station was closed in 1969, and C&O passenger service ended in 1971, Amtrak continues to serve the area with a stop at the Williamsburg, Virginia station.
By 1909, Norge contained 25 buildings, including homes, churches, stores and other businesses. Some of the original buildings still stand today.
Historical Landmarks.
The Norge Historic District was considered for the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 (reference number 92001269), but there were owner objections. The landmarks include the following:
Viking Hall: In 1908, a group of young men, who called themselves the "Vikings", purchased two lots on the corner of Richmond Rd. and Penninulsa St. for $5.00 in order to construct a Town Hall. They wanted a centrally located place to be used for dances, meetings and parties as their parents had known in Norway. Viking Hall provided a space for a variety of venues until the 1920s, when it went into disrepair. The Norge Home Demonstration Club purchased the building, renovated it, and renamed it the Norge Community Hall. To this day, the community and many local organizations continue to make extensive use of this hall.
Bergh Hotel: This hotel was built at the turn of the 20th century. It was owned and operated by Alfred Bergh to accommodate the new arrivals at the new community. The building today is thriving as a furniture store: since the 1980s it has been the "Williamsburg Wicker and Rattan".
Kinde and Nesseth Store: Hans Kinde and John Nesseth opened Norge's first store in 1903. It was a general store that sold everything from clothing to fertilizer to groceries. In 1904, the first Norge post office operated from this facility. The building was rebuilt in 1908 after a fire, and still operates today as an antique store under the name "The Old Store in the Village".
Other landmarks in Norge include the former Doll Factory, the former Williamsburg Soap and Candle Factory, Our Savior's Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Norge Train Depot, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

West Side Nut Club

The West Side Nut Club is an organization that aims to promote civic welfare in the city of Evansville, Indiana. The slogan of the organization is “From small acorns large oaks grow.”
The club began early in the 20th century as a noontime gathering of west side businessmen who lunched at West Franklin Street to discuss the topics of the day. The original name of the informal association was "West Side Epicures." In March 1914, feeling that the name "did not express anything to the layman," the men changed the name to "The Nut Club." In the same month, they proposed to the West Side Business Association that a fall festival be held in October. As a result of this proposal, the West Side's "First Annual Fall Festival" was staged on West Franklin Street. However, it was until 1921, when the Nut Club was formally organized with a much larger membership, that the festival began its tradition as a truly annual event. This festival is one of the larger festivals in the Midwestern United States.
Membership in the club is limited to 300 members. While the organization still acts as a civic organization, it also supports scholarships and sponsors local festivals, including the annual West Side Nut Club Fall Festival.

Isis (song)

"Isis" is the second track on the Bob Dylan album "Desire". It was written by Bob Dylan in collaboration with Jacques Levy.
Description.
This song is in a moderately fast 3/4 time, in the key of B-flat major. The arrangement is based on rhythm chords played on acoustic piano, accompanied by bass, drums, and violin. The harmonic progression consists of an ostinato using the following chords throughout:
Ⅰ–ⅤⅠⅠ♭–Ⅳ–Ⅰ <br>
B♭–A♭–E♭–B♭
The lyrics are all verses; there is no chorus. The melody is in the style of a modal folk song, emphasizing the tonic and dominant notes in the scale, with leaps of a fifth in between them. The mode is Mixolydian with a major third in the harmony, but Dylan's delivery of the melody uses a flatted third as in the blues.
Covers.
The White Stripes covered this song during a live performance.
Shooter Jennings has covered this song several times during live performances.
Song Narrative.
“Isis” tells a tale of a man who married an enigmatic figure named Isis. The story’s main part, told by her spouse, is about his separation from her. The song opens with their wedding "on the fifth day of May," an allusion to Cinco de Mayo (a patriotic holiday of Mexico), one of several Mexican themes found in Dylan's songs during the 1970s. Still in the first verse, the tale describes the couple's separation and the narrator's adventure through what sounds like the Wild West or Mexico. He rides a pony and hitches it up "on the right" in a "high place" symbolically “divided by a line through the middle” into “light and dark”. He goes to wash his clothes, as though to wash himself of his past. He falls in with a shady character who promises easy treasure. They ride “to the pyramids all embedded in ice,” and dig in freezing conditions until the treasure-hunting companion dies. So the narrator breaks into the empty tomb, finds no treasure, and realizes the adventure had been crazy. He buries the dead man in the tomb within the pyramid, says a quick prayer, and rides back to Isis because he still loves her. He sees her in a meadow where Isis asks him if he is going to stay this time. The narrator replies, “If you want me to, yes!”
Writing.
The song was written and recorded during a time of separation and reunion in Dylan's own marriage; consequently, for fans and critics the temptation to interpret it as an allegory of Dylan's own marital difficulties is irresistible, especially since the "Desire" album contains the song "Sara" which is openly about their marriage and separation. Since Dylan was known to include autobiographical hints in his previous songs, this interpretation cannot be considered farfetched. "Isis" draws upon mythological themes of a male hero separating from his wife, going on adventures, and returning to the marriage, going back to the Odyssey.
Dylan did an up-tempo live version of this song with the Rolling Thunder Revue, a performance of which was included in the film "Renaldo and Clara". A live Rolling Thunder version of the song was included on the compilation album "Biograph", which Dylan introduces as "a song about marriage". Coupled with the name of the album, this introduction further insinuates that the song documents Dylan's marital tribulations.

South of Nowhere

South of Nowhere is an American teen drama television series created by Thomas W. Lynch. Aimed primarily at teenagers, it first aired on November 4, 2005 and was one of six original series on The N. The second half of the third and final season aired October 10, 2008 and the final episode aired on December 12, 2008. Live webisodes were also created to accompany each episode in the season 2 storyline, and were seen exclusively through The N's website on the Click. 
The show follows the lives of the members of the Carlin family (Paula, Arthur, Glen, Clay, and Spencer) as they adjust to moving from Ohio to Los Angeles, California. One of the main focuses include the relationship between Spencer Carlin (Gabrielle Christian) and her bisexual friend, Ashley Davies (Mandy Musgrave). The close friendship between Ashley and Spencer led Spencer to question her own sexuality, a subject which created controversy before the show first aired. It was the first series on The N to deal with such a subject relating to the primary characters, and the first television show ever to have non-heterosexual teenagers as the top-billed characters."South of Nowhere" has received outstanding reviews from "TV Guide", "The Boston Tribute", "New York Post", "New York Daily News", "Entertainment Weekly", and "Variety". 
Background.
Like many of the other shows on TeenNick, such as "", this show tackled edgy and realistic subject matters for a teen drama like homosexuality, racism, abortion, adoption, homophobia, drugs, teen drinking, drug dealing, sexual identity, teen pregnancy, death, hate crimes, arrest, infidelity, contraception, college, domestic violence, stress, stepfamilies, peer pressure, sex, military and religion, love, and relationship, romance, friendship and high school.
Each episode of "South of Nowhere" is half an hour in length with commercials (23–25 minutes of actual program); the pilot episode was one hour (approximately 46 minutes of actual program). The N initially ordered 11 episodes of the series. Many people thought that The N cut the season in half, but all they did was give "South of Nowhere" a four week break. The show returned to The N's lineup in January 2006 with the remaining episodes from the original order to air. During the break between episodes, interviews were shown with two of the stars, Gabrielle Christian and Matt Cohen, during commercial breaks.
The second season was originally set to begin on October 6, 2006, but was pushed up to September 29, 2006. Its season premiere followed the sixth season premiere of "Degrassi: The Next Generation". Ratings for the second season were up by 35% from season 1 and on November 17, the series reached a high among teens with a 2.16 rating.
The network officially renewed "South of Nowhere" for a third season, and 16 episodes had been ordered. Eight episodes aired from August 10, 2007 to September 21, 2007.
On February 27, 2008, it was officially announced on the N'sider podcast that "South of Nowhere" was to be canceled after the end of season 3. On February 28, an official announcement was made at the show's website that this will be the last season.
""Things change. It doesn't always seem good, but change they do. South of Nowhere has been a great journey. A show like this could not have existed ten years ago on youth oriented television or any television for that matter. But exist it does, because things change. I have loved my experience with The N for having the courage and vision to air South. I love the fans for allowing me to tell real stories about their lives. I love all of the producers, writers, directors, and crew who took the series into their hearts and participated in SON as more than a 'job'. I love the cast and how they dimensionalized the characters and created real people that you as fans could relate to and feel for as they reflected your own lives. I especially love Spashley, The name you gave to the two lead characters. To be able to create a show called 'Excellent,' 'groundbreaking' and 'impossible to resist' is rare. To create a show that touches the hearts and lives of a generation is a gift. Thank you for allowing me and Spashley into your hearts. And remember, things change, so there's no telling where the stories of Spashley will show up next.
Love and Respect-Tom Lynch Creator / Executive Producer"
Promos began airing in March 2008 stating the show would be returning April 11. However, on March 21, it was announced that the final half of the third season had been pushed back to the fall.

Jody Morris

Jody Steven Morris (born 22 December 1978 in Hammersmith, London) is an English football midfielder, who is a free agent after being released from Bristol City. He has previously played for Chelsea, Leeds United, Rotherham United, Millwall and St. Johnstone.
Club career.
Morris came through the youth ranks at Chelsea, alongside his close friend John Terry.
While at Chelsea, he made 124 league appearances and was a late substitute in the 2000 FA Cup Final, receiving a winner's medal. He was also briefly made captain of the club by manager Gianluca Vialli.
However, when Claudio Ranieri took over from Vialli as Chelsea boss, Morris' first team opportunities diminished, and he was linked with a host of clubs including being reunited with his former England under-21 manager Peter Taylor at Leicester. Morris never regained his position as a first team regular at Chelsea, finding himself behind players, such as Roberto di Matteo, Dennis Wise, Didier Deschamps and Emmanuel Petit. He was offered a new five-year contract with Chelsea in 2003, but chose to turn it down. Graeme Souness offered him the chance of regular first team football at Blackburn Rovers and they shook hands on a deal, but it fell through. He joined Leeds United instead, but made only 12 appearances for the club. After a short spell at Rotherham United, where he scored once against Stoke City, he joined Millwall in 2004.
Morris made 70 first-team appearances for Millwall, before fracturing his cheekbone, and then suffered cruciate knee ligament damage at Derby County on his comeback game, towards the end of the 2005–06 season. He signed a new one-year deal in June 2006, with the club having an additional one-year option. In June 2007, Morris was released by Millwall. Morris then had a brief trial period at Charlton Athletic, and trained with League Two side Brentford, in a bid to earn himself a contract at the West London club.
Morris signed for Scottish side St. Johnstone on a short-term deal at the end of February 2008, playing under Derek McInnes, his former teammate at Millwall during the 2006–07 season. He scored a goal on his debut against Dundee. He played in the club's Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Rangers in April 2008 but was one of two Saints players to miss in the penalty shoot-out. After a successful five months at McDiarmid Park, Morris signed a two-year deal with the Perth side at the end of the season. He was part of the title-winning team that in May 2009 gained promotion to the Scottish Premier League after a seven-year absence. Morris signed a new contract with Saints in October 2009, while Derek McInnes praised his influence on the squad. After McInnes left St. Johnstone to manage Bristol City in October 2011, Morris assisted caretaker manager Alec Cleland with the coaching of the squad.
Morris signed a one-year contract with Bristol City in June 2012, reuniting him with Derek McInnes. Morris had his contract terminated with Bristol City on 31 January 2013.
Legal issues.
Morris has had a bad image over several legal and ethical issues. Chronologically, these include allegations that: he was one of a group of Chelsea players who drunkenly abused American tourists at Heathrow Airport within hours of the 9/11 attacks on New York City and the Pentagon; that he was involved in a drunken brawl (in 2002); that he was involved in a sexual assault (in 2003). He was also arrested for drink-driving on 1 November 2006, after driving the wrong way down a one-way street. Morris, who had one previous conviction for drink-driving, was disqualified from driving for four years, given 80 hours community service and a two-year suspended jail sentence.

Trademark (band)

Trademark are an English band, formed in 1995, and consisting of Oliver Horton, Stuart Meads and Paul Soulsby (who joined in 1999). They are noted for predominantly using synthesizers and are often branded as electropop or synthpop (and for a short time "Oddball Labcoat Pop"). They have played live regularly since 2002 and over the years their shows have included science lectures, illuminated labcoats, giant perspex bottom-plugs and slide projections. They were signed to Truck Records in 2004 and released their second album, "Raise The Stakes", in April 2007.
History.
Trademark was formed around the time of 1995 by two teenage cousins Oliver Horton and Stuart Meads. They had previously played music together as children, under the names The Sheep and Technobeat. By their mid teens they wanted to formulate themselves as a group. In 1999 the pair were joined by Paul Soulsby.
A successful gig at the 2002 Truck Festival (where Trademark were noted as being the only band without guitars) led to a series of performances in Oxford. The band also played regularly in London, with a few appearances at The Fan Club at The Verge in Kentish Town. As the band's reputation grew, Trademark supported Chicks on Speed at Oxford Zodiac, and The Human League at Ocean in London. "Fear : Disconnnection" was finished in January 2003, and was sold by the band at gigs and over the website.
In January 2004, the band followed this up by self releasing "This is Our Trademark", an EP with a set of five tracks. This led to them being signed by Truck Records, and the putting together of "Want More" which featured tracks from "Fear:Disconnnection" and "This is Our Trademark" plus a few new tracks. "Want More" was released in June 2004 to the critical acclaim of "The Sunday Times" among others. In December 2004 Trademark went on tour with the Human League around the UK.
At the start of 2005 they started recording the follow-up to "Want More". The recording took eighteen months to complete as the band wanted to explore new production techniques and instrumentations. During this time the band continued to gig in the UK, and recording was finally completed in May 2006. Due to complications with arranging distribution and PR, the album, "Raise the Stakes", was eventually released in April 2007.
Trademark have produced remixes for other artists in addition to their usual work. Artists include Matinee Club (formerly the Modern), Boy Kill Boy, Cas Fox, Goldrush and Kish Mauve.

Lewis has also played for the San Francisco 49ers. He was a Pro Bowl selection with the Eagles in 2004.
College career.
Lewis twice won Colorado's Dave Jones Award for the most outstanding defensive player and the Hale Irwin Award for the most outstanding defensive back in his junior and senior seasons. As a junior, he made a career-high 117 tackles on his way to first-team All-Big 12 Conference honors. As a senior, he was a unanimous All-Big 12 Conference first-team choice, earned third team All-America honors, and was a semi-finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top defensive back. He led the team with 112 tackles and five interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown. He closed his career ranked 9th on the school's all-time list with 336 tackles, second in forced fumbles with 10 and tied for 12th with nine interceptions. He also holds the school record with 6.5 career sacks for a defensive back.
Professional career.
Philadelphia Eagles.
Lewis was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round of the 2002 NFL Draft. As a rookie he started 4 out of 14 games and recorded 49 tackles, a sack, and an interception. In 2003, he became a full-time starter, replacing Blaine Bishop, and remained the starter alongside free safety Brian Dawkins up to the 2006 season. In 2005, he along with Dawkins were selected as the starters for the 2004 Pro Bowl for the NFC squad. But Lewis had a tough year in 2006. After giving up numerous big plays, he was benched for Sean Considine, starting only 6 of 14 games. He finished his career with the Eagles recording 386 tackles, six sacks, and nine interceptions.
San Francisco 49ers.
On March 2, 2007 Lewis signed with the San Francisco 49ers. Lewis re-gained his starting role with the 49ers and had a good season, finishing his first season with the team starting all 16 games recording 104 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and two interceptions.
On October 1, 2010, it was reported that Lewis would not be traveling with the 49ers to their next game at Atlanta after sitting out that day's practice for "personal reasons". It was further reported that Lewis has asked the team for his release. For the season until that point, Lewis had started each regular season game and had 10 tackles with no interceptions, forced fumbles, or sacks.
On October 4, 2010, Lewis was released by the 49ers and became a free agent.
St. Louis Rams.
Lewis was signed by the St. Louis Rams on October 27, 2010. He was later released at the end of the season and later retired.
Personal.
During the week of Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville, Florida Lewis won the annual EA Sports Madden Bowl competition. The tournament featured eight NFL players and Lewis claimed the top spot by defeating Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger, Colts DE Dwight Freeney (the two-time defending champion), and Broncos RB Willis McGahee.
During his sophomore year at Colorado University, Lewis was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. While not life threatening, it has contributed to Michael Lewis becoming an active spokesperson for Heart Disease awareness. He has served as a spokesperson for the Philadelphia chapter of the American Heart Association, served as the Honorary Chairperson for Philadelphia Heart Walk, and joined Steve Young in San Jose to promote the American Heart Association's Start! campaign.
Lewis' nephews are Atlanta Falcons running back Jacquizz Rodgers and Oakland Raiders wide receiver James Rodgers.

Detlev Peukert

Detlev Peukert (September 20, 1950, Gütersloh – May 17, 1990, Hamburg) was a German historian, noted for his studies of the relationship between what he called the "spirit of science" and the Holocaust and in social history and the Weimar Republic. Peukert taught modern history at the University of Essen and served as director of the Research Institute for the History of the Nazi Period. Peukert was a member of the German Communist Party until 1978, when he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. 
One of Peukert's first books was "Ruhrarbeiter gegen den Faschismus" ("Ruhr Workers Against Fascism"), a study of anti-Nazi activities amongst the working class of the Ruhr during the Third Reich. Peukert was a leading expert in "Alltagsgeschichte" (history of everyday life) and his work often examined the effect of Nazi social policies on ordinary Germans and on persecuted groups such as Jews and Roma. In particular, Peukert looked at how in "everyday" life in Nazi Germany, aspects of both "normality" and "criminality" co-existed with another. Peukert was one of the first historians to make a detailed examination of the persecution of the Romani. Peukert often compared Nazi policies towards Roma with Nazi policies towards Jews. 
Another related area of interest for Peukert was resistance, opposition and dissent in the Third Reich. Peukert developed a pyramid model starting with "nonconformity" (behavior in private that featured partial rejection of the Nazi regime) running to "refusal of co-operation" ("Verweigerung") to "protest", and finally to "Widerstand" (resistance), which involved total rejection of the Nazi regime. 
Peukert often wrote on the social and cultural history of the Weimar Republic whose problems he saw as more severe examples of the problems of modernity. Peukert died of AIDS in 1990, aged 39.

Wee Warriors

Wee Warriors Ltd. published role-playing game accessories in the 1970s. It notably published the first stand alone adventure for the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game (or in fact any role-playing game). Although they never produced official "Dungeons & Dragons" products, their early products were distributed by TSR, Inc., who at that time also published "Dungeons & Dragons". The first two Wee Warriors Dungeon Master Kits were written by Pete and Judy Kerestan.
Products of Wee Warriors include:
Wee Warriors and collecting.
Because of Wee Warriors' association with TSR in the formative years of "Dungeons & Dragons", and the fact that two of their products — "Palace of the Vampire Queen" and "The Character Archaic" — were the first products of their kind published, aftermarket prices for many of their products (in particular those products distributed by TSR) have skyrocketed in the past few years and are now second only to the true TSR rarities (such as "Lost Tamoachan") in value in the "D&D" collector's market. This price increase is directly traceable to the Internet. In the mid-1990s, rec.games.frp.marketplace became one of the primary conduits for the aftermarket trading of "D&D" collectibles and information about "D&D" collectibles. In 1995 or 1996, a few copies of Wee Warrior products (later versions of "Palace of the Vampire Queen" and "The Dwarven Glory" that were not distributed by TSR) were auctioned and sold on r.g.f.m for under $10.00. The auctioning of 1970s era "D&D" modules that many of the regular members of the group were unfamiliar with piqued the interest of the community and collectively they researched the history of the different Wee Warriors products. Reviewing early TSR catalogs and unearthing earlier versions of Wee Warrior products, it became clear to the group that Wee Warriors had played a role (how important is debated) in the early development and marketing of "Dungeons & Dragons", increasing their value to those collectors interested in the historical aspects of the game. Additionally, the discovery that TSR had actually distributed and advertised Wee Warrior products immediately increased their value to those collectors interested in completing their TSR sets. The result is the high prices seen for Wee Warrior products today.

Schoellkopf Field

Schoellkopf Field is a 25,597-capacity stadium at Cornell University's Ithaca campus that opened in 1915 and is used for the Cornell Big Red football, sprint football, lacrosse and field hockey teams. It is located just north of Cascadilla Creek on the southern end of the campus, next to Hoy Field and Lynah Rink; Schoellkopf Memorial Hall, adjacent to the stadium, contains the Robison Hall of Fame Room, the hall of fame for Cornell athletics.
Following the suicide of former Cornell football player and head football coach Henry Schoellkopf in 1912, his close friend, Willard Straight, donated $100,000 to construct the Schoellkopf Memorial Hall in honor of Henry Schoellkopf. The building was completed in 1913. In response to Straight's generous gift, members of the Schoellkopf family and the Zeta Psi Fraternity donated $70,000 for the construction of Schoellkopf Field in honor of the Schoellkopf family patriarch, Jacob F. Schoellkopf Sr. Schoellkopf Field was completed in 1915.
During May of every year, weather permitting, Schoellkopf is the site of the commencement ceremony for Cornell's Ithaca campus. Schoellkopf Field hosted the Division I NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship in 1980 and the Drum Corps International World Championships in 1974.
Modifications.
Schoellkopf's original capacity when it was completed was about 9,000, but it has been expanded and changed many times over the years. In 1924, the newly completed "Crescent" replaced the original stands on the east side of the field, increasing seating to about 21,500. In 1947, the stadium's capacity was again increased, this time to its current capacity of 25,597, with permanent steel fixtures to the west of the field.
In 1971, the surface of the field was converted to "Polyturf", an artificial turf. The field has had its turf replaced by a newer type of turf in 1979, 1988, 1999, and, most recently, in 2008. The press box above and behind the west stands was built in 1986. During the summer of 2005, renovations on deteriorating concrete forced the university to close the Crescent, but it reopened in time for the fall football season. The renovated Memorial Hall at the north end of the field opened in 2006, containing improved locker rooms and training facilities. The Hall was expanded with a three-story wing on its east side, with the varsity football locker rooms on the first floor, a Hall of Fame Room on the second floor, and a museum of Cornell football memorabilia on the third floor. Over the summer of 2008, Cornell replaced the artificial turf with a FieldTurf pitch.

Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Borgward (November 10, 1890 in Altona, Hamburg – July 28, 1963 in Bremen) was a German engineer and designer and the creator of the Borgward group, based in Bremen.
Biography.
He was of modest extraction, the son of a coal retailer, Wilhelm Borgward, and had twelve brothers and sisters. He undertook mechanical engineering studies, and obtained his engineering diploma in 1913.
He was wounded during World War I. In 1919 he became one of the partners of "Bremer Reifenindustrie". The company was restructured and in 1920 became "Bremer Kühlerfabrik Borgward & Co.
In 1924 and 1925 the company started to produce the small three-wheel trucks "Blitzkarren" and "Goliath". With his partner Wilhelm Tecklenburg, in 1928 he created the company "Goliath-Werke Borgward & Co". When the two associates took over "Hansa-Lloyd-Werke" in 1931, this became the Borgward Group.
On September 23, 1938, the "Carl F. W. Borgward Automobil- und Motorenwerke" factory was opened in Sebaldsbrück near Bremen. At that time, 22,000 people were working in the company. Until the end of the war the production of Borgward was mostly military vehicles and trucks.
When the factory was destroyed by bombing in 1944, half of the workers were prisoners of war and forced laborers. Carl Borgward was interned until 1948. Finally, just one year after being freed, he was already again a member of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bremen.
In 1949, the first "Lloyd LP 300" had been designed and produced. In Germany this car was nicknamed the "Leukoplastbomber" ("Band-aid Bomber"). The small car with a plywood body on a wooden chassis had a two-stroke engine and was in the market segment under the Volkswagen Beetle, and kept this position for more than a decade.
In 1949 Borgward had also presented the large Hansa sedan, which was the first European car with a pontoon body. He had taken ideas from American magazines, which he read when under detention.
The largest success came in 1954 with the Borgward Isabella. The Borgwards met the spirit of the time: the German customers wished for American type styling and rich chrome decoration with European compact dimensions. Borgward participated in detail in the design of all the car models.
Increased competition on the segment of mid-sized cars, and the too broad and uneconomical range of models, as well as wrong financial and tactical choices by the management, led the company into crisis at the end of the fifties. The new model Borgward-Lloyd Arabella should have eased the difficulties, but it was handicapped by quality problems.
In 1961, Borgward underwent one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in the history of Germany. The company went to the Land of Bremen, which had it liquidated, and part of the factory went to Hanomag. Years after the bankruptcy was closed, it came out that it had not been reasonable: All debts had been paid to the last cent. 
Carl Borgward died of a heart attack at the age 72 on July 28, 1963.
His life work might continue: 50 years after closing down there are new plans from his grandson to resume building cars under the name of Borgward.

Hoy Field

David F. Hoy Field, usually referred to simply as Hoy Field, is a baseball field at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where the Big Red's baseball team plays. The field—named after the "Davy" from Cornell's fight song, Give My Regards to Davy—opened in 1922 and has batting facilities that are dedicated in memory of Kerry Brooks, a 1990 graduate of Cornell and a former "Big Red" co-captain.
Hoy Field is located just west of Schoellkopf Field and east of the Engineering Quad on the southern end of Cornell's campus. The dimensions of the field from home plate to the outfield fence are 315 feet in left field, 405(?) feet in center field and 325 feet in right field. The seating capacity of Hoy Field is about 500. For many years the Bacon Cage, an indoor batting practice facility that was also used as an indoor golf driving range, was located between Schoellkopf Field and Hoy Field. However, Bacon Cage was demolished to build a parking garage and new press box on the west side of Schoellkopf Field.
In 2006, the grass turf was removed and replaced with FieldTurf, which has many grass-like properties. In 2012, the field hosted the 2012 Ivy League Baseball Championship Series, in which Cornell defeated Dartmouth two games to one.

Fruit (software)

Fruit is a chess engine developed by Fabien Letouzey. In the SSDF rating list released on November 24, 2006, Fruit version 2.2.1 had a rating of 2842. In the CEGT rating list released on January 24, 2007, Fruit version 2.2.1 had a rating of 2776.
History.
At the World Computer Chess Championship in Reykjavík in 2005, Fruit 2.2 scored 8.5 out of 11, finishing in second place behind Zappa.
Until Version 2.1 ("Peach"), Fruit was free and open-source software subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License and as such contributed much to the development in computer chess in recent years. Some people still work on the old source code and have created variations from the original Fruit.
As of July 23, 2007, Fruit became freeware. The latest version Fruit 2.3 and Fruit 2.3.1 are free to download on superchessengine.com. Fruit 2.3.1 was one of the top 3 free UCI chess engines.
Technical details of Fruit 2.1.
Fruit uses the classical Negascout (principal variation search) algorithm with iterative deepening to traverse the game tree. It also uses the null-move heuristic. The original version used a simplistic evaluation function with a robust search. Later versions have improved evaluation functions.
The board representation is distinct — Fruit uses a 16x16 board.
Derivatives.
Although Fabien Letouzey's development of Fruit stopped in 2007 with version 2.3.1, the earlier open source 2.1 version provided the basis for many other programs.
Toga II.
Toga II is a derivative created by Thomas Gaksch. It has more chess knowledge, multi-processor support, and perhaps a better search algorithm. It is based on Fruit 2.1 and is free. The strongest version is Toga II 3.0, released on 23 March 2013 by Jerry Donald. Experimental versions of Toga II running on computer clusters have competed in the World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC). At about 80 ELO above Fruit 2.3.1, Toga II is the strongest Fruit derivative .
In 2008, forks of Toga II started to appear, like Grapefruit and Cyclone.
GambitFruit.
GambitFruit is another free derivative of Fruit 2.1, created by Ryan Benitez. It plays a more aggressive style and has more chess knowledge. GambitFruit also incorporates improvements from Toga II. Development of GambitFruit stopped in 2005.
GNU Chess.
GNU Chess 6.0 is based on Fruit 2.1.
Fruit Reloaded.
Fruit Reloaded by Fabien Letouzey, Daniel Mehrmann and Ryan Benitez is an independent fork of Fruit 2.1 with a number of enhancements.
Rybka controversy.
In June 2011, a lengthy investigation by the International Computer Games Association (ICGA) determined Rybka was plagiarized from Fruit and Crafty. The author of Rybka, Vasik Rajlich, refused to address the allegations against Rybka with the ICGA, instead preferring a "ex post facto" public interview conducted by Nelson Hernandez on July 4, 2011. Rajlich had previously said: "I went through the Fruit 2.1 source code forwards and backwards and took many things." 
Senpai.
On the tenth anniversary of the start of Fruit development, Fabien Letouzey released a completely new engine, Senpai, making use of chess engine developments made in the intervening decade. It differs from Fruit in using bitboards and C++11's thread support for SMP.

Trenton, Nova Scotia

Trenton is a town located in Pictou County, Nova Scotia.
Trenton is situated on the east bank of the East River of Pictou, adjacent to and immediately north of the larger town of New Glasgow.
Economy.
The town's economy is tied to heavy industry and its residents are largely employed at Nova Scotia Power's Trenton Generating Station, Michelin's tire factory in Granton, or Neenah Paper's pulp mill in Abercrombie.
The massive TrentonWorks Ltd. facility dominates the town's waterfront, having opened in the 1870s as Canada's first steel mill before being converted to focus exclusively on manufactured steel products by the late 19th century. The TrentonWorks site was used to produce railway cars throughout the entire 20th century before production ceased in 2007. Part of the facility was used as a shipyard to produce small cargo ships during both World Wars; the railcar plant was temporarily retooled during these conflicts to produce munitions. As of 2010, the facility is undergoing a $60 million conversion to produce components for wind turbines in a partnership between South Korean industrial conglomerate Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DMSE) and the governments of Nova Scotia and Canada. The end of railcar manufacturing on the TrentonWorks site saw the loss of 1300 jobs (at peak employment); it is currently hoped that the conversion to produce wind turbine components by DMSE will return employment to pre-2007 levels.
Trenton Forge is a separate company located adjacent to the TrentonWorks property dates to the 1870s and operates one of the largest forges in the world. At one time, Trenton also hosted a glass works and paint factory.
The town has been facing significant economic turmoil in recent decades as the local economy transitions from industrial to post-industrial. Rural depopulation in Canada has affected Pictou County and Trenton has witnessed the loss of numerous institutions and businesses over the years. These include: 5 schools, a movie theatre, doctors' offices, many businesses, and several industries. The town has very few local services, relying on the growing commercial district in neighbouring New Glasgow; it has recently seen its last bank branch and gas station close.
With the town's residential and commercial tax base in decline, finances are strained for maintaining existing services and it is believed that amalgamation with New Glasgow is inevitable.
Trenton Steeltown Centennial Park.
A park occupying the north-east edge of Trenton and featuring 3 trout stocked ponds, outdoor heated swimming pool, country ski trails, and an outdoor amphitheater.
Trenton Airport.
A small privately owned and operated airport located on the eastern edge of the town.
