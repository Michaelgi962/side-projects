Close My Eyes (Mariah Carey song)

"Close My Eyes" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey for her sixth studio album "Butterfly" (1997). It was co-written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. While Carey solely wrote the lyrics to the song, both she and Afanasieff composed its music. They also produced and arranged the song together. A down-tempo piano led song, the lyrics in "Close My Eyes" revolve around negative experiences in her life, including indirectly talking about the relationship between her and ex-husband Tommy Mottola. In September 2012, Carey revealed that it is one of her most favourite and revealing songs that she has written in her career thus far.
Background.
Carey began working on "Butterfly" in January 1997. During the album's development in mid-1997 Carey separated from her husband, music executive Tommy Mottola, who had guided her career since 1988. Carey's increasing control over her own career had led to speculation in the press over the future of the couple, and they later divorced. Throughout the development of the album, in a departure from her previous style, Carey worked with various rappers and hip-hop producers, including Sean "Puffy" Combs, Kamaal Fareed, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters. Critics saw Carey's new production team as a form of revenge on Mottola and Sony Music. Carey denied taking a radically new direction, and insisted that the musical style of her new album was of her own choosing. Nevertheless, Carey resented the control that Sony, whose president was Mottola, exercised over her music, preventing her making music about which she was passionate. In contrast, Sony were concerned Carey, their best-selling act, could jeopardize her future success through her actions. The pressure of the separation and constant press attention began to take its toll of Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.
Production and recording.
"Close My Eyes" was co-written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff; Carey solely wrote the lyrics, while both she and Afanasieff composed the musical structure. It was also produced and arranged by Carey and Afanasieff. The keyboards, synthesizers and programming were performed by Afanasieff. Additional keys, drum and rhythm programming, sound design and computer programming were carried out by Dan Shea. Dana Jon Chappelle and Mike Scott served as the engineers, while Ian Dalsemer was enlisted as the assistant engineer. "Close My Eyes" was recorded at Crave Studios and The Hit Factory, both situated in New York City. It was mixed by Mick Gazauski at both Crave Studios and The Hit Factory. It was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering in Portland, ME.
Composition and lyrical interpretation.
"Close My Eyes" is a down-tempo piano led song, which runs for a duration of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical content of the song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past is presented in the lyrics "I was a wayward child, with the weight of the world that I held deep inside" and "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." As described by David Browne for "Entertainment Weekly", Carey "paints herself" in the lyrics as "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. Maybe I grew up a little too soon." Jon Pareles for "The New York Times" wrote that Carey "coos" the lyrics "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" and "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time."
Critical reception.
David Browne for "Entertainment Weekly" described how "Close My Eyes", as well as another track from the album entitled "Butterfly", were not difficult songs to interpret, writing "It isn't a reach to interpret these songs as describing life with the reportedly controlling Mottola." Jon Pareles for "The New York Times" wrote that with regard to the lyrics "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" and "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time," "Carey isn't about to turn into Alanis Morissette; "Butterfly" proclaims dependence more humbly than ever." In their guide to Carey's albums, "Rolling Stone" stated that "Close My Eyes," along with "Butterfly" and "Breakdown," were songs which indirectly spoke about her "pending extraction from the tentacles" of Mottola, who exercised his power over her as the head of Sony, the label to which Carey was signed.
Live performances.
Carey performed "Close My Eyes" for the first time live on "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" in 1997. The performance saw Carey perform the song sitting on a stool, wearing a white vest top and jeans. It was also included on the set list of her Butterfly World Tour of 1998 and Rainbow World Tour of 2000.
Legacy.
In an interview with CNN on September 7, 2012, where she was honored by Broadcast Music, Inc. for her songwriting, Carey declared "Close My Eyes" as one of her most favourite and revealing songs that she has written. She stated that it is not always her number one or signature songs which are her favourite, rather, they are "lesser-known cuts from more obscure records." When asked about how she felt about some of her number-one singles, including "Hero" ("Music Box", 1993), "We Belong Together" ("The Emancipation of Mimi", 2005) and "Touch My Body" ("E=MC²", 2008), the singer revealed "I still love those songs, I love the obscure songs because they're very close to my heart. Especially a song called 'Close My Eyes,' that's like my life story." In addition to "Close My Eyes," Carey cited "Looking In," "I Am Free," and "Underneath the Stars" ("Daydream", 1995) as some of her favourites.
The song is included on the U.S. release of "The Essential Mariah Carey". On Carey's official Facebook page on May 12, 2012, shortly after the release, she wrote, "I spent four years writing this song, only because after I performed in Schenectady, NY, I started hearing this melody and singing it over and over to myself as I was taking a bath, looking at the moon.. Four years later, as I was leaving a devastating part of my life behind, I wrote the second verse, the bridge and the outro."

Swedish general election, March–April 1887

Early general elections were held in Sweden in March and April 1887, having not been due until the autumn. They had been called following a debate over rye tariffs, and became known as the "tariff election". The result was a victory for the pro-free trade candidates, who won 136 of the 221 seats.
Background.
Tariffs had become a major political issue in Sweden during the mid-1880s. In 1885 a campaign for tariffs to be introduced on grain was rejected by both chambers of the Riksdag. The following year the issue was debated again, and whilst the Second Chamber approved their introduction, the First Chamber rejected them. The matter was settled when a joint sitting of the two chambers rejected the initiative.
In 1887 a tariff on rye was voted down 70–68 in the First Chamber, which went onto vote down all other tariffs. The Second Chamber then approved the rye tariff by 111–101. With it looking as if the tariff proposal would be passed at a joint sitting, King Oscar II dissolved Parliament with the support of Prime Minister Robert Themptander, and called fresh elections.
Results.
An intensive election campaign led to a large increase in voter turnout; since the changes to the electoral system in 1866 turnout had always been below 25%, but for this election it was 48%. Only 21.9% of the male population aged over 21 was eligible to vote.
Aftermath.
Following the spring elections, some MPs attempted to delay a decision on tariffs by proposing that a commission of inquiry be set up. Although this was supported by Themptander, Parliament rejected the idea.
Despite the Spring elections, the scheduled August and September elections still went ahead, resulting in another victory for the free trade bloc, albeit with a reduced majority.

Play It as It Lays (film)

Play It as It Lays is a 1972 American drama film directed by Frank Perry. The screenplay by married couple Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne is based on Didion's novel of the same name. The film stars Tuesday Weld and Anthony Perkins, who had previously paired together for the 1968 film, "Pretty Poison".
Plot.
Maria Wyeth-Lang (Weld), an unhappily married ex-model and B-movie actress, and her only friend, B.Z. (Perkins), a gay movie producer, contemplate suicide.
Awards and nominations.
Weld was nominated for a 1972 Golden Globe Award, for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Drama. She lost to Liv Ullmann, for "The Emigrants".
Critical reception.
Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film four stars. Positive remarks were also expressed for the two leads' performances. Ebert cited, "What makes the movie work so well on this difficult ground is, happily, easy to say: It has been well-written and directed, and Tuesday Weld and Anthony Perkins are perfectly cast as Maria and her friend B.Z. The material is so thin (and has to be) that the actors have to bring the human texture along with them. They do, and they make us care about characters who have given up caring for themselves."
Molly Haskell of "The Village Voice" was less enthusiastic, stating that she had "a hard time remembering film".
Vincent Canby of "The New York Times" found the screenplay and direction "banal", but effused praise for the performances of Weld and Perkins. "The film is beautifully performed by Tuesday Weld as Maria and Anthony Perkins as B.Z., but the whole thing has turned soft," Canby writes.

Arsys Software

Arsys Software (アルシスソフトウェア), later known as Cyberhead (サイバーヘッド), was a Japanese video game software development company active from 1985 to 2001.
Overview.
The company was founded as Arsys Software by former Technosoft staff members Osamu Nagano and Katsunori Yoshimura on 11 November 1985. They were primarily involved in PC game development, having previously created the original "Thunder Force" (a 1983 free-scrolling shooter game) and "Plazma Line" (a 1984 space racing game considered the first computer game with 3D polygon graphics) at Technosoft. In 1986, Arsys debuted with the 3D role-playing shooter "Wibarm", followed by the free-roaming adventure game "Reviver: The Real-Time Adventure" in 1987 and the 3D first-person shooter role-playing game "Star Cruiser" in 1988. When "Star Cruiser" was released in 1988, the company only had two employees, which grew to a dozen employees by 1991, when development began on "Star Cruiser 2"; by 2001, the company had reduced to three employees.
In addition to its own products, they also ported games to Japanese computer platforms, such as "Prince of Persia" and several SystemSoft games. They also contributed to the development of several games from other companies, such as the 1992 combat flight simulator arcade game "Air Combat" and Sony Computer Entertainment's 1997 racing simulator "Gran Turismo". They also released the chiptune video game music soundtrack album "Arsys Best Selection" (アルシス・ベストセレクション) in 1990. The company eventually closed down in 2001.
Notable releases.
"Wibarm".
"Wibarm" (1986), stylized as "WiBArM" (ウィバーン), was an early role-playing shooter released by Arsys Software for the NEC PC-88 computer in Japan and ported to MS-DOS for Western release by Brøderbund. It combined run and gun shooter gameplay with role-playing video game elements, and was also the first action role-playing game to feature 3D polygonal graphics. In "Wibarm", the player controls a transformable mecha robot that can shift between walking mode, a tank, and a flying jet. The viewpoint switches between several different perspectives: a 2D top-down perspective while flying, a side-scrolling view during on-foot outdoor exploration, a fully 3D polygonal third-person perspective inside buildings, and arena-style 2D shoot 'em up battles during boss encounters. 
The game features a variety of weapons and equipment as well as an automap, and the player could upgrade equipment and earn experience to raise stats. In contrast to first-person RPGs at the time that were restricted to 90-degree movements, "Wibarm's" use of 3D polygons allowed full 360-degree movement. It won the 1986 Game of the Year award from the Japanese computer game magazine "Oh!MZ", later known as "Oh!X".
"Reviver".
"Reviver: The Real-Time Adventure", also known as "Reviver" (リバイバ), is an adventure game designed by Katsunori Yoshimura and released by Arsys Software in July 1987, for the NEC PC-88, FM-7, Sharp X1, Sharp MZ and MSX2 platforms. The sub-title, "The Real-Time Adventure", is a reference to the game's introduction of a real-time persistent world, where time continues to elapse, day-night cycles adjust the brightness of the screen to indicate the time of day, and certain stores and non-player characters would only be available at certain times of the day. The game also gives players direct control over the player character. The game also features a fantasy story, full-colour 2D overhead scrolling graphics, and role-playing video game elements. It won the 1987 Game of the Year award from Japanese gaming magazine "Oh!X".
"Star Cruiser".
"Star Cruiser" (スタークルーザー) was a first-person role-playing shooter released for the PC-88 in 1988. The game is considered innovative and ahead of its time, for being an early example of an action role-playing game with fully 3D polygonal graphics, combined with early first-person shooter gameplay, which would occasionally switch to space flight simulator gameplay when exploring the open-ended outer space with six degrees of freedom. All the backgrounds, objects and opponents in the game were rendered in 3D polygons, many years before they were widely adopted by the video game industry. The game also emphasized storytelling, with plot twists and extensive character dialogues, taking place in a futuristic science fiction setting. 
It won the 1988 Game of the Year awards from the Japanese computer game magazines "POPCOM" and "Oh!X". The game was later ported to the Sharp X68000 computer platform in 1989, and the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) video game console in 1990. The game's sequel, "Star Cruiser 2", was released in 1992, for the PC-9821 and FM Towns computers. Seven chiptune video game music soundtrack albums of both "Star Cruiser" games, composed by Toshiya Yamanaka, have been released from 1992 to 2008.
"Air Combat" and "Gran Turismo".
The company contributed to the development of several games from other companies. These include Namco's 1992 combat flight simulator arcade game "Air Combat" and Sony Computer Entertainment's 1997 racing simulator "Gran Turismo".
List of video games.
The following games were developed by the company:

Five-O Poker

Five-O Poker is a social network game that follows the same hand ranking as traditional poker. 
Features.
The game is played by two players, 1-on-1 (heads-up), who are dealt five alternate face-up cards each, lined up in a row. In turn, each player draws a card from the deck and places it face-up on one of the five cards that they have, building a column or a hand. In each round, players must place "one" card on each of their columns before continuing to build the other columns: the columns must be equal in each round. The fourth card in each hand is played face-down, and the fifth card face-up. Four of the five cards in each hand are face-up, so both players are privy to their opponent’s hands. Eventually, each player will have five hands of five cards, each. 
What truly separates Five-O from other Poker variants is that competitors are playing five hands at the same time, giving an added dimension to the classic Poker game. 
Once all five hands are down, there is a single round of betting. The winner is determined by matching each hand to the corresponding hand of the opponent. The player with the stronger poker hand in three (or more) out of the five columns, wins (unless a player folds on a bet that was made). If a player beats their opponent with all five hands, this is called a “Five-O” win.
Reception.
Five-O Poker has 22,000 monthly active players and 4,000 daily active players.

The Huawei Ascend G600 is an Android smartphone made by Huawei. It was released in 2012 during August.
Models.
The phone comes in the following 4 different models, all supported by the Google Play Store:
The first letter of each model is the network: U = UMTS (WCDMA) and C = CDMA. The last D stands for Dual Sim feature.
Note that the U8950 G600 sold outside China, is single sim. C8950D is the CDMA dual sim version.
The HUAWEI U8950N-1 & HUAWEI U8950N-51 appear to be American / Australian models, while the HUAWEI U8950D is the Chinese model.
Specifications.
Though the phone would be classed as 'mid range', its hardware and features allow it to fall into the upper range of mid range phones. So essentially, it just borderlines high range.

Zoogoneticus tequila

Zoogoneticus tequila, Tequila Splitfin or simply Tequila fish, is a species of goodeid fish (family Goodeidae). The specific epithet, "tequila", derives from the Tequila Volcano, which looms near the type locality. It is endemic to Mexico. Its current distribution is restricted to a single spring pool in Teuchitlán, only in diameter, where a population consisting of less than 50 adult fish live. Even in this habitat, it is outnumbered by introduced guppies by a factor of six. Before the discovery of the pool population in 2000/2001, "Zoogoneticus tequila" was generally thought to inhabit rivers; however, no fish could be found in the original habitat and the species was considered extinct in the wild. Introduced fish species have been implicated in the disappearance of "Zoogoneticus tequila" from its type locality.
Along with other Mexican goodeids, "Zoogoneticus tequila" are viviparous; this lead the genus to be originally included in family Poeciliidae. Males are smaller than females, with standard length up to 41 mm in males and up to 58 mm in females. The sexes can also be distinguished by colouration.

2013–14 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round

The qualifying phase and play-off round of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League were played from 2 July to 28 August 2013, to decide 10 of the 32 places in the group stage.
All times were CEST ().
Round and draw dates.
All draws were held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.
Format.
In the qualifying phase and play-off round, each tie was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e., the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time was played, divided into two fifteen-minutes halves. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e., if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out.
In the draws for each round, teams were seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie decided randomly. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the results of the previous round were known. For these draws (or in any cases where the result of a tie in the previous round was not known at the time of the draw), the seeding was carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advanced to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient was to advance, it simply took the seeding of its defeated opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form "groups" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and for ensuring that teams from the same association were not drawn against each other, and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition.
Teams.
There were two routes which the teams were separated into during qualifying:
A total of 54 teams (39 in Champions Route, 15 in League Route) were involved in the qualifying phase and play-off round.

2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage

The group stage of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League was played from 17 September to 11 December 2013. A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage.
Draw.
The draw was held on 29 August 2013, 17:45 CEST (), at the Grimaldi Forum, Monaco. The 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the title holders being placed in Pot 1 automatically. They were drawn into eight groups of four containing one team from each of the four seeding pots, with the restriction that teams from the same national association could not be drawn against each other. Moreover, the draw was controlled for teams from the same association in order to split the teams evenly into the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage.
The fixtures were decided after the draw. On each matchday, four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) alternating between each matchday. There were other restrictions, e.g., teams from the same city (e.g., Chelsea and Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid) in general did not play at home on the same matchday (UEFA tried to avoid teams from the same city playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days), and Russian teams did not play at home on the last matchday due to cold weather.
Teams.
Below were the 32 teams which qualified for the group stage (with their 2013 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included 22 teams which entered in this stage, and the 10 winners of the play-off round (5 in Champions Route, 5 in League Route).
Format.
In each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams entered the Europa League round of 32.
Tiebreakers.
The teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings:
Groups.
The matchdays were 17–18 September, 1–2 October, 22–23 October, 5–6 November, 26–27 November, and 10–11 December 2013. The match kickoff times were 20:45 CEST/CET, except for matches in Russia which were 18:00 CEST/CET. Times up to 26 October 2013 (matchdays 1–3) were CEST (), thereafter (matchdays 4–6) times were CET ().

Bernard Chanda

Bernard Chanda was one of Zambia’s greatest strikers and was the league top scorer three times. Nicknamed 'the Bomber,’ he played for three of Zambia’s biggest clubs - Roan United, Mufulira Wanderers and Rokana United, and is remembered for scoring a hat-trick in the 4-2 semi-final victory over Congo at the 1974 African Cup of Nations tournament. Chanda was voted Zambian Footballer of the Year in 1974 and is fourth on the list of all-time goal scorers for Zambia in international matches behind Godfrey Chitalu, Alex Chola and Kalusha Bwalya with 28 goals.
Playing career.
Chanda was born in Luanshya in 1952 and first turned out for amateur side Buseko United in the mid-sixties. He went to Roan Antelope Secondary School and later joined Roan United where he burst onto the scene as Roan’s top scorer in 1969 and was selected to the Zambia Schools national team. He was still a schoolboy when he was called to the national team when Zambia faced off against visiting French side RC de Strasbourg in June 1970 and was again his club’s top marksman that season, finishing as one of the country’s leading goal-scorers in 4th place with 43 goals behind eventual winner Sandy Kaposa of Kabwe Warriors, his clubmate Boniface Simutowe and Kitwe United’s Godfrey ‘Ucar’ Chitalu.
A born goal-scorer, Chanda was a striker in the classic mould with powerful shooting and great control. When he expressed his desire to leave Roan during the 1971 season, the club suspended him for six months in order to ward off interest from Wanderers and Rokana until the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) moved in to pave the way for his transfer to Mufulira in August 1971 and within two months, had won his first piece of silverware when the ‘Mighty’ men coincidentally met Roan in the Castle Cup final at Dag Hammarskjoeld Stadium on 10 October 1971 in Ndola and prevailed 5-4 with Chanda sharing the goals with Samuel ‘Zoom’ Ndhlovu and Abraham Nkole who scored a hat-trick. That same month, he made his debut for Zambia a week later in a 2-0 defeat to Kenya at the same stadium, in the Peter Stuyvesant series of matches. He scored his first goal for Zambia in the next match in the series when Zambia turned the tables with a 3-1 victory in Kitwe before losing the deciding match 1-0 in Lusaka.
On 15 July 1973, Zambia met Nigeria in Lusaka in the final qualifying round for the 1974 Cup of Nations. Nigeria took a 20th minute lead through Iziebige but Chanda equalized in the 31st minute and was brought down for a penalty in the second half which Brighton Sinyangwe converted. In the end, Nigeria were taught a footballing lesson by the mesmerizing Zambians as Simon Kaushi and Sinyangwe each scored 2 goals for a 5-1 scoreline. In the return leg, Chanda and Kaushi were once again on the score-sheet as Nigeria edged Zambia 3-2 in Lagos which was enough to see Zambia through to her very first CAN tournament. He scored a fantastic volley when Zambia crushed Morocco 4-0 in a World Cup qualifier in Lusaka in October and won a second Castle Cup with Wanderers.
At the end of the season, he tied with Chitalu for the top scorer’s award with 41 goals. Chanda would probably have finished the season as outright top scorer had he not decided to boycott matches to force through his transfer from Wanderers to Rhokana United. At first, the Mufulira side was reluctant to release him but they relented and he moved to Kitwe for the then record fee in Zambian football of K4,000. With his distinctive afro hair-style, he earned the nickname ‘Bomber’ due to his lethal finishing and the devastation he would wreak on many an opposing defence.
At the Cup of Nations, he led Zambia’s attack playing every minute of every game and confining Chitalu to the bench in some of the matches. He scored a stunning hat-trick in the semi-final against defending champions Congo, after the two teams had been deadlocked 2-2 at full-time. No Zambian player would score a hat-trick at the CAN for 22 years. A panel of international journalists voted Chanda among the best players at the tournament together with Kaushi, Dick Chama and goalkeeper Emmanuel Mwape.
In December of that year, Chanda tormented his former club Wanderers and scored a hat-trick as Rhokana beat Wanderers 4-3 to win the Chibuku Cup, their first piece of silverware since 1969 and their last trophy for eight years. At the end of the season, he was named Footballer of the Year from a field which included other big names like Dickson Makwaza, Chitalu, Chama and Mwape.
In June 1975, the national team travelled to Mozambique for that country’s independence sports festival and Chanda was kicked out of the team by the Team Manager Eliya Mwanza for alleged unruly behaviour when he told the coach Henry Kalimukwa that his family was suffering while he was playing soccer away from home and that he was prepared to go back to work rather than play football for the national team. However he could not leave as flights were fully booked so he spent the rest of the trip with the basketball team and returned home with the rest of the contingent.
On 20 August 1975, Chanda and his Rokana United teammates Mark Masumbuko, Nelson Sapi and Roan United’s Joseph Mapulanga were suspended from the national team for the rest of the season for not reporting to camp for an Olympic Games qualifier against Malawi. Chanda was also fined K50 for his conduct in Mozambique. His response was that he had written to coach Ante Buselic on 11 August informing him of his personal problems. “It’s a great shock to me because I did not refuse to go to camp. In the letter I explained to the coach about my problems and I indicated I would join the team later.” He further said that he and the other three suspended players were not called before the disciplinary committee to personally give their side of the story but only learnt about it in the press.
On his conduct in Mozambique, Chanda said “I was not called to defend myself. Honestly I don’t think anything serious happened. It was mere talk between me and the coach and I cannot comment further about it.” However, the punishment stood and Chanda missed that year’s East and Central Africa (ECA) tournament which Zambia hosted and were knocked out in the group stages.
On his return the following season Chanda scored a late equalizer to rescue Zambia in a 2-2 draw with Sudan in an Olympic Games qualifier in Ndola. Zambia won the second leg 5-4 on penalties after a goalless deadlock, with the ‘Bomber’ scoring in the shootout. He featured for Zambia in the East and Central Africa Cup in Zanzibar where they went all the way to the final only to lose to Uganda 2-0. In November 1976, Chanda announced that he had decided not to play in his team's remaining three matches because he was tired and needed a rest. He also stated that there was too much bickering and criticism towards him. In spite of this, he still finished the season as top scorer with 38 goals, 7 ahead of Chitalu.
In Sept 1977, Chanda who was in the news again for disciplinary reasons and was stripped of the captain's armband and suspended for one year with shorter sentences for Brighton Sinyangwe, Sapi and two other players. Accused of refusing to travel to Lusaka for a league match against Green Buffaloes, Chanda said he would not appeal against the ban. “Each time I am selected to represent Zambia in any tournament, the club suspends me. Now I have been suspended because Zambia will be playing in the Africa Cup finals in Ghana. He added that he was fed up with the whole business and that an inquiry into the administration at Rhokana needed to be done which he felt ‘left much to be desired.’
In December 1977, Chanda dispelled rumours that he had signed a contract with a Saudi Arabian club and also reports that he had been approached by former national team coach Ante Buselic to play in Yugoslavia. As a consequence of his suspension, he missed that year’s ECA tournament and CAN 1978. 
Chanda did not feature for Zambia in 1979 but when Zambia crashed 4-1 to Egypt in an Olympic Games qualifier in February 1980 in Cairo and with Chitalu suspended for the second leg, he was recalled by coach Dick Chama but he failed to inspire the team in a 0-0 draw. His last appearance for Zambia came in April 1980 when he replaced Alex Chola in a game against Tanzania during a tournament to celebrate Zimbabwe’s independence.
Coaching career.
After almost ten years with Rhokana, Chanda switched camp to Kitwe rivals Mutondo Stars at the end of the 1981 season though his best days seemed to be behind him. He took up coaching and in 1985, he crossed over to Botswana to coach Gaborone United. He came back to Zambia in 1986 and became coach for Kafue Textiles FC, leading them to promotion to the Premier League in 1987 and for this feat, was nominated for the Coach of the Year award which went to Bizwell Phiri of Premier League champions Kabwe Warriors.
In June 1988 he left Kafue to return to Roan as assistant coach to Dickson Makwaza saying “I am now in Luanshya and with Roan. I like it here. It is nice to be home and I am happy.” He later became coach at Roan and later moved to FAZ Division II North side Ndola Lime in 1991.
Death.
Chanda died on 16 May 1993 in Luanshya Mine Hospital after poor health, which saw his legs swelling and causing him to be hospitalised for three weeks prior to his death. The ‘Bomber’ was laid to rest at Ndola’s Kansenshi Cemetery and was survived by a wife Milika and three children.

Association Pesinet

Association Pesinet is a French NGO, founded in late 2007, that leverages ICT and mobile agents to improve detection and early treatment of childhood diseases in Mali. The service combines frequent monitoring of simple health indicators with an affordable insurance system and education on preventive health practices.
History.
Pesinet was founded in 2007 and launched activities in Mali in 2009, after a formal agreement was signed between Pesinet and Mali’s Health Ministry for the implementation and evaluation of the pilot site.
The first program was launched in January 2010 during an official ceremony attended by the Health Minister. It covers the neighbourhoods of Bamako Coura and Bamako Coura Bolibana.
In 2011, and at the request of the two community health centers in Dravela and Ouolofobougou, two neighboring districts of Bamako Coura, Pesinet began to work on the extension of its activities in these two areas. The launch of the two new programs was made official during a ceremony that took place in October 2011, during which the partnership agreement with the community health centers was officially signed.
Mission and Founding Principles.
The mission of Association Pesinet is to sustainably reduce infant and child mortality by facilitating access of populations to existing healthcare systems. In partnership with local health centers, Pesinet designs and deploys home-based health monitoring services for children and mothers. 
Pesinet’s action is motivated by the following facts:
The founding principles of the organization are:
How the service works.
The service is based on the voluntary enrollment of families and costs 500 FCFA/child per month, or less than 1 euro. For this price, families are entitled to regular home visit by the health agents as well as free doctor consultations and 50% reduction on medications. Pesinet agents visit families several times each month to examine children, collect key data (weight, cough, fever, diarrhea…) and enter it in an application on a mobile phone. The data collected by the agents is transmitted in real time to a database accessible by the doctors at the closest health center. Doctors at the health center read that data and summon children at risk through the responsible health agent.

Michael H. Nash

Michael Harold "Mike" Nash (1946-2012) was an American labor historian, librarian, and archivist. Nash was the Director of the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives at New York University throughout the early years of the 21st Century until the time of his death. Nash is best remembered for the key role he played in first obtaining and then integrating the archives of the Communist Party USA into Tamiment Library's holdings, in addition to other acquisition projects.
Biography.
Early years.
Michael Harold Nash was born in 1946 in The Bronx area of New York City. Nash was raised as a red diaper baby as both his parents were school teachers with radical political views. His father Julius Nash, a science teacher, suffered job discrimination during the Cold War of anti-communism, having been removed from his teaching job in 1955 as part of a far reaching purge and blacklist of Communist and former Communist teachers in the New York City School system. 
This purge, similar in form to policies implemented in other places in the United States presented their subjects with an irresolvable conflict: If one refused to sign a "loyalty oath" indicating that the signer had never been a communist, the individual was fired and blacklisted. If one signed such an oath and admitted that were or had been a member of the Communist Party USA, one was fired and blacklisted. If one signed such an oath and the "little McCarthys" administering the purge determined the signer had lied, the signer would be fired and blacklisted. Thus barred from the public schools, the elder Nash went on to manage a toy store, also teaching in a local yeshiva. His mother, Ruth Nash, taught business and was a union activist.
As a young boy Nash was not driven by scholarly pursuits, instead being more interested in collecting comic books, baseball cards, and following the exploits of the local baseball team, the New York Yankees.
Nash attended Harpur College, today known as Binghamton University, in Vestal, New York, from which he graduated with a B.A. degree in History in 1968. Nash then enrolled in Columbia University in New York City, earning a M.A. in American History in 1969. Nash began work on a PhD in labor history, beginning a study of the political behavior of coal miners and steel workers during the progressive era. Nash was discouraged both by the magnitude of the project he visualized and the job market for labor historians, however, so he took steps towards becoming a professional archivist, earning a Master of Library Science degree in 1974. 
Upon completion of his MLS, Nash returned to Binghamton University to complete his PhD in American Labor History under the tutelage of historian Melvyn Dubofsky, earning the degree in 1975. More years would pass before his dissertation subject, an attempt to demonstrate the emergence of American workers in heavy industry "into something resembling a class-conscious proletariat," would find print. This work, "Conflict and Accommodation: Coal Miners, Steel Workers, and Socialism, 1890-1920," was published by Greenwood Press in 1982.
Career.
With his scholarly writing occupying his free time, Nash began his career as an archival specialist at the New York Public Library in 1974, a position in which he remained for 6 years. Nash subsequently moved to assume a position as Assistant Archivist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. At Cornell Nash worked in the library of School of Industrial and Labor Relations, a position which lost its funding in 1982, forcing another change of employment.
Unable to find a position as a labor historian or archivist, Nash spent the next two decades of his career at the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, Delaware, a facility specializing in collections dealing with the history of business and technology. 
Nash came to New York University in the middle of 2002 to take a position as Director of the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, a specialized labor history collection housed at the university. Nash regarded this as "the dream job of his life" and remained in this position until the time of his death in 2012. 
Nash was instrumental in the organization and expansion of this collection, which had its roots in the collection of the Socialist Party's Rand School of Social Science until its acquisition by NYU in 1963.
In March 2007 Nash was instrumental in arranging the transfer of the Reference Center for Marxist Studies (RCMS), the archive and library of the Communist Party USA, to NYU. Included in this material were some 20,000 books, 5,000 magazines, a complete run of party newspaper "The Daily Worker," every party pamphlet ever produced, and the 1 million image photo archive of "The Daily Worker" and its successor publications.
Other collections garnered by Nash for Tamiment Library included the papers of Victor Navasky of "The Nation" magazine, Central Intelligence Agency defector and whistle blower Philip Agee, left wing civil rights and civil liberties attorney William Kunstler, and those of radical historian Howard Zinn.
According to Michael Stoller, Director of Collections and Research Services at NYU, Nash was particularly effective in obtaining key collections for Tamiment Library due to his sincerity, optimism, and likability. More importantly, Nash was also successful because of the respect that he earned by his achievements as a labor historian, his professionalism, and his knowledge of what was important and what was not important
In addition to his professional duties, Nash was the founder and co-director of the Center for the United States and the Cold War and the Frederic Ewen Center for Academic Freedom. Nash was an expert on the Spanish Civil War who periodically taught undergraduate courses on that topic at NYU. He was also a board member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, an organization whose holdings are also housed at Tamiment Library at NYU, and a member of the Historians of American Communism.
Death and legacy.
Michael Nash died on July 24, 2012, of a pulmonary embolism. He was 66 years old at the time of his death. At the end of his life he was working with the Occupy Wall Street movement in both safeguarding their developing collections for history and encouraging and using his knowledge of peoples movements to advise them on strategy and tactics His legacy lives on in his work, the ongoing work of the Tamiment Library, and the deep affection that so many people felt for him over the decades. Few individuals combined the personal and the political as positively as Michael Nash. Few have really been scholars, teachers and activists as he had been. (ref name-Norman Markowitz)

Prince Frederick of Orange-Nassau

Frederick, Prince of Orange-Nassau (, ; 15 February 1774 6 January 1799) was the youngest son of William V, Prince of Orange and Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic and Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia, sister of King Frederick William II. Commonly called Fritz inside the family, he chose a military career with the Holy Roman Empire, he died of a fever while serving in Padua, Italy.
Early life.
Family.
Prince Frederick, or "Fritz", as members of his family called him, was born in The Hague during the Dutch Republic period. His parents, William V and Princess Wilhelmina, already had two children: Frederica Louise Wilhelmina (1770–1819) and Willem Frederik (1772–1843); Louise would later marry the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Willem would become the first Dutch King. Frederick was related to the British royal family through both his father, who was the grandson of George II of Great Britain, and through his mother, who was the grandniece of George II.
Education and military beginnings.
Even as a young boy, he was bright and showed much promise in the military field; General Prince Frederick Stamford, mathematician Leonhard Euler and historian Herman Tollius were among his tutors. After military training in Brunswick, where his cousin once removed was reigning duke, Prince Frederick began active military service in 1792 when the States-General granted him the rank of lieutenant-general of the cavalry and grand master of artillery. In 1793, he was called to war when the Republic had to be defended against the French. He was an inspiring leader and was usually in the forefront. Prince Frederick took upon himself the defense of the northwestern part of Brabant. Later, he served under his older brother at Veurne (Furnes) and Menin (Menen). While fighting in the latter battle at Flemish Wervik, on 12/13 September 1793, Frederick suffered an injury when he was shot in the shoulder; this was an injury he never fully recovered from. In 1794, he was appointed general of the cavalry.
Life in exile.
In 1795 the prince wanted to withdraw troops from Friesland, where they were fighting the French and Dutch patriots; his father did not give permission. In January 1795, the Batavian Republic, where the stadtholder and his family were no longer welcome, was established. Thus, William V took his entire family and fled to Great Britain, where George III, William's first cousin, was king. On July 22, 1795, Prince Frederik and his "aide-de-camp", Perponcher, went to Osnabrück, where the so-called rassemblement occurred. He gathered Dutch officers and troops for a raid in the Batavian Republic. Back in England, Frederick fell in love with Princess Mary (1776–1857), the fourth daughter of King George III, and she with him. George, however not opposing the marriage, felt that the marriages of his three elder daughters, Charlotte (1766–1828), Augusta Sophia (1768–1840), and Elizabeth (1770–1840), had to be tended to first. Eventually, after Frederick's death, Mary married her first cousin, the Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh.
Austrian military service.
Prince Frederick went via England to Vienna, where he was given, in May 1796, the rank of Major General. He commanded a brigade in the corps of Von Wartensleben, in the army of Archduke Charles. Later, commanded by Kray, he defended southern Germany and Nassau. Prince Frederick participated in several battles in Germany and played a role in the conquest of Kehl in January 1797. As Archduke Charles was growing more and more pleased with Frederick, the latter was asked to go to Italy. There he became the commander of four German battalions. He managed on 2 April 1797 to stop the vanguard of Napoleon at Einöd, which resulted in the Treaty of Campo Formio. Due to his performance in Einöd he received the Military Order of Maria Theresa. Because he still suffered from his wounded shoulder, he underwent surgery at Görz in the summer of 1797 and recovered in Baden. On 29 October 1797, he was appointed lieutenant field marshal. After spending the winter of 1797–98 at Hampton Court, he returned to Vienna at the end of April 1798. Then followed a five-week tour of inspection along the Italian border. Prince Frederick was still not fully recovered and collapsed at Gorizia. On 14 November 1798 he was appointed commander of the Austrian army in Italy, with the title of ""kaiserliche und königliche Feldzeugmeister"", as he prepared the army for battle against the French army under Scherer.
He visited many sick soldiers while in Padua, Italy. It is possible that, as a result of these visits, he contracted a malignant fever. On the night of 5–6 January 1799, Prince Frederick died in the arms of his aide, Perponcher. Originally, he was buried in the cloister of the Hermits of Padua. In 1807, his family ordered a marble monument by Antonio Canova. In 1896, Queen Emma ordered Frederick to be moved to Nieuwe Kerk, the family burial site in Delft. She boarded a vessel to Padua, but was unable to find the prince's remains. The body was finally found on 3 July 1896 and was buried in Nieuwe Kerk on 7 August 1896. The monument was rebuilt in the church behind the tomb of Frederick's brother Willem.

Episode 5 (Twin Peaks)

"Episode 5", also known as "Cooper's Dreams", is the sixth episode of the first season of the American mystery television series "Twin Peaks". The episode was written by series co-creator Mark Frost and directed by Lesli Linka Glatter. "Episode 5" features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean and Richard Beymer, with guest appearances by Chris Mulkey and David Patrick Kelly.
Glatter has noted that the episode exemplifies the themes of longing and desire which she feels characterize the series; she has also called to attention its careful balance between tragic and comic elements. Exterior scenes in the episode were filmed in California's Angeles National Forest and blended with stock footage of Washington to enhance the setting.
FBI agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) and Twin Peaks sheriff Harry Truman (Ontkean) continue to investigate a murder in the small mountain town, while local businessman Benjamin Horne (Beymer) schemes to burn down its sawmill to further his property empire. First airing on May 10, 1990, "Episode 5" was viewed by approximately 18 percent of the available audience during its broadcast; it has received positive reviews from critics.
Plot.
Background.
The small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has come to the town to investigate, and initial suspicion has fallen upon Palmer's boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and the man with whom she was cheating on Briggs, James Hurley (James Marshall). However, other inhabitants of the town have their own suspicions: the violent, drug-dealing truck driver Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re) is seen as a possible suspect, especially to his wife Shelley (Mädchen Amick), who has found a bloodstained shirt among his belongings.
Events.
Cooper is woken early by the sound of a raucous party in the Great Northern Hotel. He leaves to meet Truman, while Jerry Horne (David Patrick Kelly) meets his brother Benjamin (Richard Beymer) to discuss the new Icelandic investors in their property developments. Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) arrives, disoriented and wishing to return to work, but the Hornes send him home. Cooper, Truman and Doctor Hayward (Warren Frost) discuss Johnson's bloodied shirt, learning that the blood is not Laura's but that of drug smuggler Jacques Renault.
Johnson's wife Shelley is having breakfast with her lover Bobby Briggs; the two roleplay the idea of shooting Johnson, while they toy with Shelley's pistol. When Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) arrives to enquire about Johnson, Briggs hides and Shelley attempts to make Johnson seem deeply involved in Laura's death and Renault's disappearance. Elsewhere, lovers Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) and Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) meet to discuss their spouses. Jennings' husband Hank (Chris Mulkey) has been released from prison, while Hurley's volatile wife Nadine is increasingly becoming mentally unwell. Jennings leaves, feeling that things are going nowhere, leaving Hurley crestfallen. Meanwhile, Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) is interviewed for a job at her father's department store and blackmails the interviewer into giving her a position at the shop's perfume counter—where Laura and Ronette Pulaski worked before their abduction.
Madeline Ferguson (Lee) meets with James Hurley and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) at the RR Diner. They discuss Laura's death; Hurley and Hayward believe Laura hid a diary at her home and want Ferguson, who is now staying there, to look for it. They leave as Jennings and Shelley arrive; Hank is seated at another table and pulls Jennings aside to asks to start working to earn her trust. Meanwhile, using a photograph from Renault's home and the clues from Cooper's dream, the investigators find a log cabin in the woods that they believe to be the scene of the murder; on the floor Cooper find a fragment of a One Eyed Jacks casino chip that matches the piece found in Laura's stomach.
At a party in the Great Northern to welcome the new investors, Benjamin and Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) secretly discuss their plan to burn the town's sawmill and buy the land cheaply. Leland begins sobbing hysterically when a piece of music begins, and Martell escorts him away. Meanwhile, Shelley waits at home with her gun, as Johnson arrives back. Hank attacks him beside his truck, threatening him; Johnson returns home and lashes out at Shelley, and she draws the gun and shoots him.
Production.
"Episode 5" was written by Mark Frost, who created "Twin Peaks" along with David Lynch. Frost had previously penned "Pilot", "Episode 1" and "Episode 2" with Lynch; this was his first solo writing credit for the series, and he would pen a further seven episodes as the series progressed. The episode was directed by Lesli Linka Glatter, making her first contribution to the series. Glatter later returned to helm three more episodes in the second season.
Glatter has praised MacLachlan's involvement in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored the character of Cooper; she noted that he was as devoted to the character's comedic elements as to his dramatic side and that the crew had difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without laughing at his comic delivery. She has also noted that although the writers and directors on the series tended to emphasize the rapport between Cooper and Fenn's character Audrey Horne, there was never any intention to bring the characters together as a couple.
Glatter also highlighted Da Re's menacing character, finding it to be a contrast to the actor's real-life "sweet" personality. Da Re's mother, Johanna Ray, was the casting director for "Twin Peaks". Glatter similarly lauded the comic performances of most of the cast, particularly singling out the "dry wit" of Beymer and his chemistry with guest star Kelly. She felt that the series struck a good balance between its humorous elements and its dark subject matter, playing its serious moments with an appropriate level of gravitas and avoiding becoming a "self parody". She also has expressed her belief that the main thematic concern of the series was "longing", and that most characters were driven by their desires for each other; she particularly noted the affair between Briggs and Shelley Johnson as an example of this expressed, but secret, longing.
Throughout the series, scenes set in the Great Northern Hotel's dining room—seen at the beginning of most episodes—almost always featured a convention of some sort, whether this was intended to be noticed or not. "Episode 5" features a group of American Indian Movement members in this capacity. Exterior scenes in the woods were filmed at Angeles National Forest in California and blended with establishing shots of the Washington landscape that had been filmed to provide the series with stock footage.
Broadcast and reception.
"Episode 5" was first broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company on May 10, 1990. In its initial airing, it was viewed by of US households, of the available audience. For the following episode, these figures would drop to of the population and of the available audience.
Writing for "The A.V. Club", Keith Phipps rated the episode an "A−", noting the scene in which Leland breaks down while dancing to "PEnnsylvania 6-5000" as a highlight. Phipps felt that the episode advanced the plotlines of the series and the development of its characters equally well, adding that it showed "Twin Peaks" "wasn't just a fleeting phenomenon but an honest-to-goodness great show". "AllRovi" Andrea LeVasseur awarded the episode four stars out of five. Daniel J. Blau of Television Without Pity pointed out the sexual undertones of the episode, noting in particular Briggs and Shelley's playing with a pistol as clear phallic imagery. However, Blau was heavily critical of Marshall's acting, finding his performance to be a "train wreck".

Mary Beth Ellis

Mary Beth Ellis (born July 12, 1977) is an American long-distance triathlete. She holds the record for the fastest iron-distance race by an American woman, set at Ironman Austria in 2011 with a time of 8:43:34. She was 5th in the world at Ironman World Championships in 2012, and she took second place at both the 2008 and 2009 Ironman 70.3 World Championship. She has been named USA Triathlon's Non-Olympic/ITU Female Athlete of the Year for both 2011 and 2012.
Athletic career.
Ellis was born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Rehoboth Beach and Lewes, Delaware by Stephen and Kathleen Ellis. She attended Lawrenceville School where she competed in swimming, golf, lacrosse, field hockey, and track and field. Ellis went on to college at Northwestern University to major in industrial engineering and then obtain a master’s degree in marketing. While at Northwestern she competed on the school's cross country team and was a four-year letter-winner and NCAA qualifier for the NU swimming team.
Following college, Ellis moved to Colorado where she participated in half-marathon and marathon races while working full-time. In 2005, she was diagnosed with osteoarthritis due to her high volume of run training. She moved on to compete in triathlon to reduce some of the stress put on her body. She experienced enough success within her first year of short course racing that she was able to turn pro and quit her full-time job. Under coach Siri Lindley, Ellis experienced some success in her first year of ITU racing in 2006. Following the set back of injuries experienced in 2007, Ellis focused on qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics in triathlon, but she fell short and failed to qualify. It became apparent that Ellis was more suited for longer distance triathlon events versus shorter, Olympic style racing.
Ellis started competing in Ironman 70.3 events that same year after Olympic qualifying had finished, and experienced immediate success winning her first 70.3 race at the Lake Stevens event. She would finish 2nd that year at the Ironman 70.3 World Championships, and then follow that up with a repeat 2nd place finish at the 2009 Championship event. The following year, in 2010, Ellis by her own admission was racing poorly due in part to over training. During the off season she hired Brett Sutton as her coach and joined teamTBB. That next year in Ironman Triathlon racing, Ellis won Ironman Austria with the third fastest Ironman time by a woman ever. In 2012, Ellis experienced more success winning Ironman Texas, the U.S. Championships at Ironman New York, and Ironman Cozumel.
2013.
In 2013, Ellis continued to have more success by winning Ironman 70.3 Florida, defending her title at the Alpe d'Huez Triathlon, and claiming first place at both the Ironman France and Ironman Mont Tremblant races; which continued her steak of remaining unbeaten at Ironman races outside of the Ironman World Championships.
On September 9, 2013, while training for the upcoming Ironman World Championship in October, Ellis broke her collarbone in a bike accident in Cozumel, Mexico. After the injury, she initially felt that she wouldn't be ready to compete in the 2013 Ironman, but that changed after undergoing surgery. Ellis' condensed a four to six-month recovery plan into one month with the goal of competing in the October 12th race in Kona, Hawaii.

Discovery reptiles

Discovery Reptiles is a traveling zoo in Naples, Florida. Its collection includes some of the most endangered reptiles on earth. Discovery Reptiles was founded in 2009, and started with just four animals. They had two Red Tailed Boa Constrictors "Boa constrictor", an Asian Water Monitor"Varanus salvator" and an African Rock Monitor"Varanus albigularis ionidesi". Over the course of 2010 Discovery Reptiles slowly added to their animal collection with the addition of a Caiman Lizard "Dracaene guianensis" and Rhinoceros Iguana "Cyclura cornuta" which is listed as Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN. The main purpose of the zoo is to educate the public on conservation and the importance of biodiversity; in order to do that it wanted to add an animal that would capture the attention of audiences around Southwest Florida. Discovery wanted an animal not found in the Southwest Florida region or commonly found in zoos, so they added a young female Yellow Anaconda "Eunectes notaeus".
More species and more rescues.
With the addition of a Yellow Anaconda, the zoo started gaining popularity and was able to acquire more animals to their collection, but there was a slight twist. Instead of purchasing new animals from breeders Discovery Reptiles decided to rescue and rehabilitate unwanted animals and sick animals. They were able to rescue Sulcata Tortoise "Geochelone sulcata", Jungle Carpet Pythons "Morelia spilota cheynei", Coastal Carpet Pythons "Morelia spilota mcdowelli", a Borneo Blood Python "Python curtus breitensteini", an Argentine Black and White Tegu "Tupinambis merianae", Amazon Tree Boa "Corallus hortulanus", Bull Snakes "Pituophis catenifer sayi", Corn Snakes "Pantherophis guttatus guttatus", Hog Nose Snake "Heterodon nasicus", Hog Island Boa "Boa constrictor imperator" and many more. They also added other animals, including a female Caiman Lizard to go along with their two male, critically endangered Grand Cayman Blue Iguanas "Cyclura lewisi", and two endangered Louisiana Pine Snakes "Pituophis ruthveni".

John Linsley

John David Linsley (12 March 1925 – 25 September 2002) was an American physicist who performed pioneering research on cosmic rays, particularly ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. He did his most significant work from 1959 to 1978 using a ground-based array of detectors at Volcano Ranch in New Mexico. He is best known for being the first to detect an air shower created by a primary particle with an energy of 1020 eV. This was the highest energy cosmic ray observed up to that point. Linsley's observations suggested that not all cosmic rays are confined within the galaxy and showed the first evidence of a flattening of the cosmic ray spectrum at energies above 1018 eV.
Early life and career.
John David Linsley was born on March 12, 1925 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His father, James Adolphus Linsley, was born in Morris, Minnesota and worked for the Minneapolis Transit Company as a streetcar conductor. His mother, Martha Carolina Linsley, was born in Follinge, Sweden and was a graduate of the University of Minnesota. He had one sister, Ruth Anne Linsley Forman.
Linsley was homeschooled by his mother for much of his childhood and graduated from Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis in 1941. He attended the University of Minnesota, graduating in 1946. While working on his bachelor’s degree, Linsley also served in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946.
After completing his undergraduate education, Linsley remained at the University of Minnesota to work on his Ph.D. under the direction of Edward P. Ney. He completed his Ph.D. in 1952, after which he worked as a research fellow at the University of Minnesota from 1952 to 1954. In 1954, Linsley took a job as a Research Associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He held this position from 1954 to 1955 and from 1958 to 1972. While at MIT, Linsley was a member of a team led by Bruno Rossi. This team used an air shower array at Harvard University's Agassiz Astronomical Station to observe air showers created by cosmic rays using ground-based liquid scintillator detectors. The analysis techniques Rossi's group developed laid the groundwork for the analysis of data from future arrays.
Volcano Ranch.
In 1957, Rossi asked Linsley to design a much larger array based on the principles of the Agassiz array. Linsley worked with Livio Scarsi from the University of Milan to build an array of nineteen plastic scintillation detectors at Volcano Ranch near Albuquerque, New Mexico. They began making observations in the summer of 1959. On February 22, 1962, Linsley observed an air shower created by a primary particle with an energy greater than 1020 eV, the highest energy cosmic ray particle ever detected at the time. Linsley's observations at Volcano Ranch expanded the known cosmic ray energy spectrum, clarified the structure of air showers, and provided the first evidence on ultra-high-energy cosmic ray composition and arrival directions. Linsley’s observations also indicated that not all cosmic rays are confined within the galaxy and provided the first evidence of a flattening of the cosmic ray spectrum at energies above 1018 eV.
Volcano Ranch was transferred from MIT to the University of New Mexico in 1972 and Linsley took a position as Adjunct Professor of Physics at the University of New Mexico. In 1973, Linsley created a denser array at Volcano Ranch to study the lateral distribution of air showers. His work led him to develop the elongation rate theorem, which describes the rate of the change of the atmospheric depth of the air shower maximum with the energy of the primary particle. In 1976, Linsley became a Research Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico. Volcano Ranch was closed in 1978, when funding for the project ran out.
Later career.
After the closing of Volcano Ranch, Linsley continued his work in the field of cosmic rays. In 1979, he proposed detecting the fluorescence created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere through the use of a space-based observatory, a project which he called SOCRAS (Satellite Observation of Cosmic Ray Air Showers). This was the first proposal of a space-based cosmic ray observatory. He served as Principal Investigator on two research projects and collaborated on several others.
Linsley was nominated for the Nobel Prize in physics by Pierre Auger in 1980 for his work with cosmic rays. He won the Premio Internazionale San Valentino d’Oro in astrophysics in 1982. In 1986, he became a Visiting Professor at the University of Palermo and a Senior Fellow at the Istituto di Fisica Cosmica in Palermo, Italy. In the mid-1990s, Linsley's idea of a space-based observatory was revived by the establishment of the international AirWatch consortium. Linsley was actively involved in this project, which evolved into AirWatch-OWL, and in the Extreme Universe Space Observatory, another project to create a space-based observatory for the investigation of cosmic rays.
John Linsley died on September 15, 2002 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Huguenot Memorial Museum

Huguenot Memorial Museum portrays the history of the French Huguenots who came to South Africa at the end of the seventeenth century. This is depicted in the museum. Displays are housed in the main building, and continue in the annex. The museum also has a shop, and is adjacent to the Huguenot Monument.
History.
In 1954 the Dutch Reformed congregation in Cape Town decided to demolish the building and to erect a youth hostel in its place. Attempts to prevent the demolition were unsuccessful. It was then proposed to erect the building elsewhere. In 1957 it was agreed to rebuild Saasveld in Franschhoek (some 70 km away), next door to the Huguenot Monument, and use it as a Huguenot Museum. Each brick was numbered, and after transporting it 70 km to Franschhoek, was replaced in its original position. The museum was officially opened on March 11, 1967.
Built in 1967, the Main building is a replica of a building that was situated in Kloof Street, Cape Town called Saasveld. The architect of Saasveld was Louis Michel Thibault. The main building features original items from this building eg door frame, slates from Robben Island, the gates to the premises. All were brought to Franschhoek by the Huguenot Society.
Displays.
The museum displays cover two major topics. In the main building the history of the French Huguenots is discussed in detail. Topics include: Why they came, who brought them, where they settled and a list of surnames of Huguenot origin. Displays in the annex convey the history of the town of Franschhoek, and have a broader scope. Topics in this building include: Fynbos, Khoisan history and the local fruit industry.
The museum contains a large variety of furniture, bibles, silver ware, kitchen utensils, documents, relics and artefacts which strikingly illustrate the life of the Huguenots at the Cape of Good Hope. Because the Huguenots arrived at the Cape of Good Hope carrying little possessions, most of the artefacts were acquired after settling at the Cape.
Museum Activities.
The museum presents education programs eg history of the Huguenots, Fynbos, Khoisan, Architecture and Genealogy / Families. Guided tours of the museum for visitors are also available. The annual Huguenot Festival presented by the Huguenot Society in conjunction with the museum takes place in the last weekend of October. During the festival the museum also host an exhibition of roses.
Museum Publications.
The museum publishes booklets on various subjects. Recent titles include: "The History of Franschhoek", "The Edict of Nantes", "Contact with Indigenous People" and the genealogy series on Huguenot surnames.

Armagh Harps GFC

Armagh Harps Gaelic Football Club is a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA)club in the city of Armagh, County Armagh, Northern Ireland. It plays exclusively Gaelic football in the Senior competitions of Armagh GAA. Its home ground is Páirc na Mainistreach, also known as Abbey Park, in the north of Armagh city. 
The club has won the Armagh Senior Football Championship 20 times.
History.
Founded in 1888, the Harps represented Armagh in the 1890 Ulster Final, beating Cookstown's Owen Roes, but losing to All-Ireland Champions Midleton of Cork in the All-Ireland Semi-Final. Football declined somewhat in the period 1910-1915, but revived in 1916 when it appears that the Harps reformed under a new name, Young Ireland. Another Armagh City club, St Malachy's, was active in the 1940s.
The Armagh Harps were recreated under the original name in 1945.

Mihály Káthay

Mihály Káthay de Csekekáta ("Kátay"; c. 1565 – 12 January 1607) was a Hungarian soldier and noble in the Principality of Transylvania, who served as Chancellor of Transylvania from December 1604 to September 1606. He was imprisoned and executed on charges of murder of Prince Stephen Bocskay, the leader of the Bocskay's War of Independence.
Life.
Family.
He was born into a lower noble family which originated from Csekekáta (today Nagykáta). His father was Ferenc Káthay, lieutenant of judge royal Gábor Perényi and later served in the Castle of Eger. He had a younger brother.
Mihály Káthay married twice: his first wife was Anna Drugeth de Homonna, and the second was Margit Mágóchy. Káthay had a daughter from one of his wives.
Career.
He started a military career at his young age, he served besides Stephen Báthory even then. He fought in the Long War. He seriously wounded, along with judge royal Stephen Báthory de Ecsed in the Battle of Hatvan. In the summer of 1594 he moved to Transylvania to help to Prince Sigismund Báthory. He became "knight" of the prince in 1596.
He was appointed captain of Kálló in 1599. His work was hindered by shortage of money. He asked in several letters the Szepes Chamber to pay off the defenders' military pay. learning the refusal, "the soldiers very outraged", "so much that all they wanted to rebel, I found it hard to quiet them" - wrote Káthay to the Chamber in one of his letters dated 1 November 1599.
He had considerable wealth by his second marriage and had a close relationship with the most powerful landowners of Northern Hungary from that time. He joined to Stephen Bocskay in 1604 who named as his Chancellor. He had an important role in the preparation of the Treaty of Vienna in 1606. Because of that and his Roman Catholic religion, the Calvinist preachers from the court looked suspiciously to him.
Arrest and death.
Káthay made contact with the Habsburgs and the Ottoman Empire. As a result he was imprisoned in Kassa (today: "Košice, Slovakia") by Bocskay in September 1606. Later, Bocskay, suffering from edema, thought wrongly that Káthay poisoned him. The prince died on 29 December 1606. After that Káthay was then hacked to bits by Bocskay's adherents in the town's marketplace.
Several mourning poems maintained about Bocskay's death, which also accuse and condemn Káthay.

Solomon S. Huebner

Dr. Solomon Stephen Huebner (March 6, 1882, Manitowoc, Wisconsin – July 17, 1964, Merion, Pennsylvania) was Emeritus Professor of Insurance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Emeritus President of The American College of Life Underwriters, and Emeritus Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the American Institute for Property and Liability Underwriters (now known as the American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters).
Dr. Huebner is known widely as "the father of insurance education." He originated the concept of "human life value", which became a standard method of calculating insurance value and need. He established the goal of professionalism in the field of insurance, developed the first collegiate level program in insurance and chaired the Department of Insurance at Wharton, and contributed greatly to the progress of adult education in this area. Huebner was a prolific writer, possibly best known for his classic work, "Life Insurance".
The University of Pennsylvania maintains the prestigious Huebner Foundation to promote research and education in insurance economics and risk management.
Early life.
Huebner was born on March 6, 1882 in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on the shores of Lake Michigan. Raised on a 200-acre farm, his parents (Frederick and Wilhelmina) were major landholders and members of educated Wisconsin families. They instilled in him a strong belief in freedom, religion and in the value and power of education. They taught him to work hard and to be committed to the highest standards of personal integrity.
Huebner graduated from Two Rivers High School at age 16 in 1898. After being elected class valedictorian, his education continued at the University of Wisconsin where he was awarded a Bachelor of Letters in 1902. In addition, he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and earned the Master of Letters the following year. His thesis was entitled: “The Distribution of Stock Holdings in American Railways.” Published in Railway Age, it so impressed the University of Pennsylvania officials that Huebner was awarded a Harrison Fellowship in Economics.
During the next two years, Huebner pursued his studies for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Huebner was highly acclaimed for receiving it in the shortest time possible and was among the youngest students to receive that honor in University of Pennsylvania history. He was only 23 years old.
Career.
Huebner may be best known for his work in life insurance education, but he was also an expert in the fields of economics, Property/Casualty Insurance, and marine insurance. He began teaching the first organized courses in the world on the Stock Exchange and the “Economics of Insurance” at the University of Pennsylvania in the fall of 1904. 
At that time “Applied Economics” was viewed with some disdain by the classical economists at most universities. Huebner’s research led him to the realization that no leading business school in the United States offered any type of insurance-related coursework. He applied and became the first instructor of Insurance at Wharton with an annual salary of $500. 
The life insurance field was getting much publicity at that time because of the Armstrong Investigation in New York State. This was an important event in insurance history with a comprehensive legislative investigation of life insurance operations led by Charles Evans Hughes. Many years later, Huebner said that the investigation and corrective legislation that followed was “one of the best things to ever happen to life insurance.” He felt it put the business on an upward curve.
Huebner rose quickly through the teaching ranks to assistant professorship (1906); professor of insurance and commerce (1908); and in 1913, head of the University of Pennsylvania Insurance Department. This was the first insurance department of its kind in any collegiate institution. 
In addition to regular coursework, Dr. Huebner also taught evening and extension classes. He lectured to the public, to professional groups in all industries, to women's clubs, and to life insurance salesmen everywhere. Huebner's commitment and vigor impressed people on a wide scale, and especially within the circles of life-insurance men. In 1927, Huebner's vision brought into being The American College of Life Underwriters. The purpose of the college was to establish certification of professionally qualified life insurance salesman, using the designation, CLU (Chartered Life Underwriter).
Today, Dr. Huebner's legend lives on at both The American College and The Wharton School. The American College now offers 12 designations (including the CLU), a Master of Science in Management, and a Master of Science in Financial Services. The major in Insurance and Risk Management also remains a vital part of the Wharton School. Coursework and concentrations are available at both undergraduate and graduate levels.

Manuel Espinosa Batista

Manuel Espinosa Batista (September 12, 1857 – November 27, 1919) was a Colombian pharmacist turned politician who campaigned for a separate Panama state and became one of "Founders of the Republic". He is known for his philanthropical works.
Early life.
Born in Cartagena, Colombia, his father was Manuel Espinosa and his mother was Purificación Batista. At the early age of 13 he traveled to the Isthmus of Panama after being encouraged to do so by his relatives in Panama. He started to work for a pharmacy, raising money to pay for his books and pharmaceutical studies. Eventually, he became an expert pharmacist and established a pharmacy on Central Avenue in 1882, in front of the Arias-Feraud house (now known as Casa de la Municipalidad). A few months later, his great friend Jose Gabriel Duque was given a government contract to create a National Lottery and Manuel became his guarantor. Later, in 1899, Manuel became president of the company. Manual invested in, and created, other business ventures.
Political career.
Manuel Espinosa Batista started his political life by winning a place in the city council from 1897 to 1898. He was a supporter of the separatist movement, which wanted the separation of Panama from Colombia. This group of separatists was formed by José Agustín Arango, Manuel Amador Guerrero, Nicanor de Obarrio, Ricardo Arias, Federico Boyd, Carlos Constantino Arosemena, Tomás Arias, and Manuel Espinosa Batista. Nowadays they are called the "Founders of the Republic". José Agustín Arango organized meetings in the back part of the pharmacy owned by Manuel Espinosa Batista.
Panama achieved separation from Colombia on November 3, 1903. That night the local council proclaimed the separation and convened open cabildo in Panama city the next day. During that cabildo, Panama independence was made official in an act signed by the members of the council and the citizens who attended the event. The President of the council Demetrio H. Brid appointed the Provisional Government Junta formed by: José Agustín Arango, Tomás Arias and Federico Boyd - Manuel Espinosa Batista was appointed Deputy Member of the Provisional Government Junta, and his appointment was announce to each member by a note from Demetrio H. Brid. From November 9, 1903 to December 7, 1903 Manuel Espinosa Batista temporary replaced Federico Boyd within the Junta.

He granted scholarships to various boys with little resources, if they had willingness to study, and sent them overseas. In 1885 there was a great fire in Colón and many houses were destroyed, so he donated money to build new houses for the people who had lost everything. He also donated money to build streets in Panama city, donated money for the city's electric lighting and for the recollection of garbage.
As a member of the city council, if there was not enough money to complete a scheme for the city, he would finance projects from his own pocket.

This last show of the season was in benefit of the old people's home Bolívar and the children's orphanage.
Legacy.
Manuel Espinosa Batista died at the age of 62, on November 27, 1919. the day before the 63rd birthday of the President Belisario Porras.

A Boy Bringing Bread

A Boy Bringing Bread (c. 1663) is an oil on canvas painting by the Dutch painter Pieter de Hooch, it is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is part of The Wallace Collection.
Descriptions and commentary.
A boy offers a basket of bread to a lady in an interior; behind them a tiled courtyard leads into another dark interior, beyond which can be seen a canal with a second woman, possibly the boy’s mother, watching the transaction from afar. With its masterly illusion of receding depth, the picture demonstrates De Hooch’s sensitivity to differing effects of daylight in adjoining spaces, in this case through a series of indoor and outdoor spaces. Originally a girl reading a book sat in the doorway, but she was painted out in favour of the lady and the boy, whose stance echoes the verticality of the architecture and prompts the eye to travel upwards into the picture space. By paring down his composition De Hooch focuses the viewer’s attention and imbues the scene with intensified quietude.
Provenance.
Purchased by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford for his collection c. 1856.

Dan Starkey (series)

The "Dan Starkey" novel series is written by Colin Bateman. It revolves around the private detective Dan Starkey and cases that Starkey investigates.
1990s.
Events of Bateman's debut novel "Divorcing Jack" (1995), set in Belfast, Northern Ireland, follow a turbulent period in the life of married, cynical and usually drunk journalist Dan Starkey. Dan's wife Patricia leaves him after a drunken party in which he kisses student Margaret. What follows is a darkly comical tale of murder and mystery. The novel was adapted into the film with the same name.
In "Of Wee Sweetie Mice and Men" (1996), protagonist Dan Starkey is tasked with writing a book about "Bobby "Fat Boy" McMaster", the current heavyweight champion of Ireland, in his upcoming championship fight with Mike Tyson on St. Patrick's Day. When McMaster's wife is kidnapped, Starkey must figure out who's behind it before the varied and numerous factions that McMaster has offended, in his short time in New York, catch up with them.
In "Turbulent Priests" (1999), based on Wrathlin Island, a small island north of mainland Ireland, Dan Starkey has been sent by Cardinal Daley, the Primate of All Ireland, to investigate reports that the Messiah has returned in the shape of a young girl, Christine, about to start school. Starkey has his wife Patricia and illegitimate child "Little Stevie" join him as he investigates the tiny dry community and meets considerable resistance from the defensive residents.
2000s.
In "Shooting Sean" (2001), Dan Starkey is employed by legendary film star, Sean O'Toole, who is looking to escape his type cast action hero career and move into directing movies. Unfortunately, O'Toole is making a movie based on an infamous IRA member, nicknamed "The Colonel", and events soon lead to Starkey once again struggling to both protect his wife "Patricia" and illegitimate child "Little Stevie", while also keeping himself alive and writing.
In "The Horse with My Name" (2002), Dan Starkey is currently both unemployed and single. His estranged wife Patricia, after cancelling their counselling sessions with Relate, has entered into another relationship with someone called Clive and is currently living with him in the family home. Starkey receives a request from Mark Corkery, known as "The Horse Whisperer", to investigate racing entrepreneur Geordie McClean who is apparently not quite as clean as his name would suggest.
In "Driving Big Davie" (2004), Dan Starkey is invited to Florida by his old friend, "Big Davie", who has a spare honeymoon ticket after being dumped by his erstwhile fiancée. Starkey is back with his wife Patricia and feels he's gotten over the murder of his toddler son "Little Stevie" - however his wife disagrees and declares that an American road trip would do him good. When the opportunity to avenge Stevie's death presents itself, Starkey cannot refuse. A movie adaptation of the novel was planned in 2001, with Steve Bendelack attached as director.
"Belfast Confidential" (2005) surrounds Dan Starkey and his recent appointment as the editor of Belfast's trendiest magazine, "Belfast Confidential", described by Bateman as "a cross between "Private Eye" and "Hello"". After the murder of his close friend Mark McBride, AKA "Mouse", Starkey is convinced by Mouse's Thai bride to take over the editorship and discover who was behind the murder. Starkey discovers that Mouse was working on a list of the 50 most powerful people in the area before his death and decides that those at the top are the most likely suspects. He sets out to discover if this is indeed the case.
2010s.
In "Nine Inches" (2011), the four-year-old son of Jack Caramac, a shock jock radio broadcaster and old friend of Dan Starkey, is kidnapped for one hour and returned unharmed. Starkey, now a self-styled "upmarket private eye", is hired to investigate the kidnapping and ascertain who might have been behind it – a significant task given the number of people offended by Caramac's illustration of the crime and corruption prevalent throughout Belfast. Starkey's investigations lead him to the Miller brothers, officially the Chiefs of Staff for the Ulster Volunteer Force, although viewed by Starkey as merely a group of Shankill Road thugs intent on pedalling drugs across Belfast. The Millers have been attempting to evict a widow named Jean Murray from her house and Starkey intervenes, hoping his knowledge of their drug operation would dissuade any repercussions. Starkey's interference leads to the Murray's house being burnt down with Jean still inside.

Exhibitionnist

Exhibitionnist (foaled 1934) was a French-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare, best known for winning two Classics in 1937. The filly won three times from six races in a racing career which lasted from 1936 until July 1937. After winning as a two-year-old she finished second on her three-year-old debut to Mid-day Sun, a colt who went on to win the Epsom Derby. Exhibitionnist then won the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket and a the Epsom Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse a month later. She finished fourth in her only subsequent race and was retired to stud, where she had some success as a broodmare.
Background.
Exhibitionnist was a bay mare with a white blaze bred in France by her owner Sir Victor Sassoon, a British businessman and hotelier. The filly was sired by Solario, who won the St Leger Stakes in 1925 before becoming a highly successful sire. The successes of Exhibitionnist contributed significantly towards Solario winning the British sires' championship in 1937. Exhibitionnist's dam, Lady Wembley won three races before being bought by Sassoon for 750 Guineas as a prospective broodmare. Lady Wembley was a daughter of Captive Princess, a mare who won the Irish Oaks and Irish St Leger in 1916.
Sassoon sent the filly to be trained by Joseph Lawson at his stables at Manton in Wiltshire. Although her name was sometimes "corrected" in the press, it was officially spelled with a double "n", because of a mistake by a French clerk when her name was being registered.
Racing career.
Racing as a two-year-old in 1936, Exhibitionnist won one race.
On her first appearance of 1937, Exhibitionnist ran against colts in the Free Handicap over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 15 April. Carrying a weight of 105 pounds, she finished second, beaten three quarters of a length by Mid-day Sun, a colt who was carrying six pounds less. As both horses were lightweight, it seemed unlikely that the race would prove a significant classic trial, but the value of the form was boosted when Mid-day Sun finished third in the 2000 Guineas.
Two days after the 2000 Guineas, Exhibitionnist started 10/1 second favourite for the fillies' equivalent, the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile. Gainsborough Lass, a sister of Orwell, started favourite at 10/11 in a field of twenty fillies, and was confidently expected to win after an impressive win in the Column Stakes. Ridden by the fifty-two-year-old Steve Donoghue, Exhibitionnist led almost throughout the race and won by half a length from Spray, with Gainsborough Lass a head away in third. Her performance was described as "delightfully smooth" and gave Donoghue his first winner in the race. The winning time of 1:43.8 was 0.8 seconds faster than Le Ksar's winning time in the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance.
Mid-day Sun won the Derby at Epsom on 2 June, and Exhibitionnist started 3/1 favourite in a field of thirteen for the Oaks two days later. Partnered again by Donoghue, she was among the leaders from the start and turned into the straight with a slight lead and position on the inside rail. In the straight she went clear of the field and won easily by three lengths and a head from Sweet Content and Sculpture. As at Newmarket, Exhibitionnist beat the colts on the clock: her winning time of 2:36.8 bettered the 2:37.2 set by Mid-day Sun. After the race Donoghue, who was riding his fourteenth and final British classic winner, said that he "never had an easier ride in my life".
In July, Exhibitionnist was sent to Goodwood to contest the ten furlong Nassau Stakes. She started odds on favourite but finished fourth behind First Flight. Exhibitionnist never raced again and was retired from racing.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Exhibitionnist an "inferior" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks.
Stud record.
In 1944, the ten-year-old Exhibitionnist was sent to the Newmarket December sales and was sold for 10,500 guineas. At stud, Exhibitionnist produced several winners. Her best foal was Sweet One, sired by Honeyway, who won the Ribblesdale Stakes and finished second in the Yorkshire Oaks in 1954.

Manindra Chandra Nandy

Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandy, K.C.I.E. (29 May 1860 – 12 May 1929) was the Maharaja of Cossimbazar Raj from 1898 to 1929 and a philanthropist and reformist in the period of the Bengal Renaissance.
Family.
Manindra Chandra Nandy was born on 29 May 1860 into the royal family of Cossimbazar. His mother, Gobinda Sundari (sister of Raja Krishnath Roy) died when he was two, and his father died when he was ten.
He became the Raja of Cossimbazar, as per the wishes of Cossimbazar Raj family, as there were no direct male descendants alive after the death of Maharani Swarnomoyee in 1897.
Education.
Manindra Chandra suffered from a severe illness when he was fourteen, which prevented him from going to school. Though he later recovered from the illness, he studied at home and did not obtain formal education.
Marriage.
He married Maharani Kashishwari of Khirgram, Burdwan at the age of seventeen. They had three sons and two daughters. Their eldest son, Mohim Chandra Nandy, died early in 1906. His other two sons were Srish Chandra Nandy and Kirti Chandra Nandy.
Contribution for the promotion of education.
Krishnath College.
In 1902, Berhampore College was renamed Krishnath College to preserve the memory of Raja Krishnath Roy, the maternal uncle of Manindra Chandra and husband of Maharani Swarnamoyee. In 1905, control of Krishnath College was handed over to Manindra Chandra Nandy by the government via a deed of transfer. A board of management was created, with Nandy as its president. Nandy spent Rs. 45,000 annually for the maintenance of the college.
Krishnath College School.
A large building for Krishnath College School was constructed and expanded at the expense of Rs. 135,000 by Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandy at Berhampore College to accommodate 1,200 students annually. The foundation stone was laid in 1909 and the school formally opened in 1911.
Different schools.
Manindra Chandra established an English medium high school with a hostel at his ancestral village of Mathrun, Burdwan, at a cost of Rs. 50,000. He maintained schools in other villages and patronised schools for the handicapped in Calcutta.
Different colleges.
Nandy contributed Rs. 15,000 for the construction of The Calcutta Medical School and College of Physicians and Surgeons of Bengal in 1904. He donated Rs. 5,000 for Daulatpur College and Rs. 50,000 for Rangpur College. In 1914, he contributed Rs. 5,000 to Medical College and Hospital for Women and the Nurses Training Institute in New Delhi. He created a chair at Banaras Hindu University and a science chair at Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose Laboratory. He patronised the Bengal Technical Institute, National College, and The Association for the Scientific and Industrial Education of Indians.
Publications.
He wrote the books "The Indian Medicinal Plant", "A History of Indian Philosophy", "Fundamental Unity of India", "History of Indian Shipping and Indian Maritime Activity" and others.
Offices held.
Manindra Chandra was president of the British Indian Association in 1922, 1923, and 1929 and a member of Imperial Legislative Council from 1913 to 1921. Nandy was the chairman of Berhampore Municipality and Murshidabad District Board.
Awards.
Manindra Chandra received the title of Maharaja on 30 May 1898. He received his knighthood in 1915. Nandy was also an honorary fellow of Calcutta University.
Death.
The Maharaja died on November 12, 1929.

Ahwaz Field

Ahvaz Field, is an oil field, with the NW-SE axis (parallel to Zagros Mountains) is placed in the NE of Ahvaz City.
The NIOC has provided reserve estimates for the recently discovered Khami Group reservoir at the Ahwaz field in the Zagros Fold Belt, Iran’s largest field. Gas in place in the Lower Cretaceous Fahlian Formation reservoir is estimated at 990 Bcf, of which 700 Bcf is considered recoverable. Condensate reserves are estimated at 308 MMb in place, of which 120 MMb is producible. The overlying Dariyan Formation reservoir, also of Lower Cretaceous age, has 350 MMbo in place, of which recoverable reserves are given as 54 MMb. In addition the reserve was said to be capable of producing 150 MMcfg/d and 37,000 b/d, with the gas to be used for injection into the nearby fields. In July 2006 when the NIOC concluded its "Ahwaz 307" appraisal well, it believed it had discovered "remarkable" oil and gas resources in the Khami Group reservoir. The potential was first realized in the 1970s when two deeper pool tests of the Lower Cretaceous were drilled. However, although oil and gas/condensate was proven, the high pressures encountered prevented full valuation.

Koi No Yokan

Koi No Yokan is the seventh studio album by the American alternative metal band Deftones. The album was released through Reprise Records on November 12, 2012, in the UK and November 13, 2012, in the United States. The album was met with positive reception from professional critics on release. It debuted at no. 11 on Billboard charts with sales of 65,000 copies. According to Nielsen Soundscan the album sold over 180,000 copies to date in the US.
Background.
Band frontman Chino Moreno characterized the album as "dynamic" with a full range of noise, noting that more contributions were made to the album from bassist Sergio Vega compared to their previous record, "Diamond Eyes". The Deftones recorded Koi No Yokan differently from their previous studio releases. This led to the more rhythmic sound featured on it. The major change in the recording process came with the use of the Fractal Audio Systems Axe-FX Preamp FX Processor. Koi No Yokan was actually the first album guitarist Stephen Carpenter used a different amp and cab as he did on those that preceded it. Fractal Audio creates the sound of multiple outboard amps and pedals and allowed for different tones. Bassist Sergio Vega said the group was able to "bring Fractal into hotel rooms and run it into software and record ideas and flesh them out later". The group tracked guitar, bass, and vocals. Then recorded drums, and replaced the guitar, bass, and vocals. Vega confirmed "everything was organic". "Koi No Yokan" marks the second album to not feature long-time bass player Chi Cheng, who was in a car accident in November 2008 which left him comatose or partially conscious state up until his death in 2013. The album was released on November 14, 2012, although there is no exact translation of the album title, in Japanese under the title 恋の予感 ("Koi No Yokan"), it means "Premonition of Love".
Release.
On September 19, 2012, the band released the song "Leathers" as a promotional single via a free download on their website. On October 8, 2012, "Leathers" was released as the album's first single. "Leathers" was also released as a limited edition cas-single with "Rosemary" as its B-side. On October 3, 2012, the song, "Tempest", premiered on PureVolume for streaming. "Tempest" was released as a single on October 9, 2012. Koi No Yokan was released on vinyl in four versions: a standard retail version pressed on 140-gram black vinyl (3,000 units); a direct-to-consumer version on 180-gram black vinyl with foil-stamped numbered jackets (1,000 units); an international edition pressed on 180-gram vinyl; and an exclusive edition sold through Hot Topic retailers pressed on 140-gram clear-colored vinyl (1,500 units). Rolling Stone called the album adventurously aggressive, and stated that, "Koi No Yokan ranges from brutal, blunt-force trauma ("Gauze") to epic prog-rock atmospherics (the sprawling, enchanting "Tempest"). Opener "Swerve City" sets the tone immediately with a bludgeoning riff, but Deftones also take nuanced approaches to angsty tension, weaving meticulously crafted cosmic rock on "Entombed" and wading through murky, jagged textures on "Rosemary." The band also launched a tour on October 9, 2012 which ended on November 21 in Los Angeles. The band played at venues with capacities between 1,000 and 4,000 with the idea of fans being able to experience the music before the album even came out.
Critical reception.
The album was met with overall critical acclaim.
The aggregate review site Metacritic assigned an average score of 86 to the album based on 18 reviews, indicating "Universal Acclaim". With this score "Koi No Yokan" was among the eight best reviewed albums of 2012.
In May 2013, "Revolver" named "Koi No Yokan" Album of the Year at the 5th annual "Revolver Golden Gods" Award Show.
"Loudwire" gave "Koi No Yokan" a 4.5/5 rating in November 2012.

Deinodryinus areolatus

Deinodryinus areolatus is an extinct species of "Deinodryinus" in the wasp family Dryinidae. The species is solely known from an Eocene fossil found in the Baltic region.
History and classification.
"Deinodryinus areolatus" is known only from a single fossil, the holotype, specimen number PIN No. 964/60, which is housed in the A.A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow. The specimen is composed of a fully complete adult female wasp. The specimen is preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of amber. The amber dates to between forty and forty-five million years old, and, being Baltic amber dispersed in the sea, a more specific type location than the Baltic region is not possible to identify. "Deinodryinus areolatus" was first studied by the Russian paleoentomologist Nadezdha Ponomarenko in 1975, with a redescription by paleoentomologists Adalgisa Guglielmino and Massimo Olmi, both of the University of Tuscia. Ponomarenko's 1975 type description of the new genus and species was published in the Russian journal "Paleontologicheskiy Zhurnal", with the species placed by her into a new genus Electrodryinus. "Electrodryinus " was subsequently synonymized with "Deinodryinus" in a 1984 paper by Massimo Olmi, resulting in the current binomial "Deinodryinus areolatus". "D. areolatus" was the first of three "Deinodryinus" species to be described from the fossil record. "Deinodryinus velteni" is also known from a fossil preserved in Baltic amber, while "Deinodryinus? aptianus" is known only from a Mongolian compression fossil in marl.
Description.
The holotype specimen is a complete adult female preserved with areas of the face, vertex, pronotum, scutellum and metanotum obscured. Overall the female is in length, with antennae that are less than three times the length of the head and macropterous hyaline wings. The antennae are composed of ten segments, densely hairy, and distinctly clavate, (club shaped) in structure. The mandibles have four teeth on each side, which progress from large to small. The tooth size changes in relation to the placement front to back on the mandible. The forewings have three cells at the base that are formed by pigmented veins. The forewings have a pterostigma that is approximately four times as long as it is wide, and a stigmal vein that is not "S" shaped. The forelegs have a chelate structure, with the subapical tooth or other teeth.

<doc id="36875918" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36875918" title="Taxonomic impediment">
Taxonomic impediment

Conservationists, ecologists, biodiversity scientists, lawmakers, and many others rely heavily on taxonomic information to manage, conserve, use, and share our biodiversity. The world-wide shortage of this important taxonomic information, the gaps in our taxonomic knowledge, and the shortage of trained taxonomists and curators to fill this need has come to be known as the taxonomic impediment. The importance of the taxonomic impediment was recognized by the Convention on Biological Diversity, signed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, and initiatives have occurred that have not yet solved the problem.
The greatest contributions of taxonomy to science and humanity are yet to come. Against formidable odds and with minimal funding, equipment, infrastructure, organization and encouragement, taxonomists have discovered, described. and classified nearly 1.8 million species. While increasing attention is being paid to making this substantial amount of accumulated taxonomic information more easily accessible, comparatively little attention has been paid to opening access to the research resources required by taxonomists themselves. Benefits associated with ease of access to museum records (e.g. Global Biodiversity Information Facility) or 'known' species (e.g. Encyclopedia of Life) are seriously restricted when such information is untested for validity or is simply unavailable, as is the case for three-quarters or more of the species on Earth. We act as if taxonomy is done but nothing could be farther from the truth.
Impediments to taxonomy.
The causes of the current crisis in taxonomy have been ascribed to a loss of perspective in evolutionary biology as the modern evolutionary synthesis developed during the 1930s and 40s: a conflation of "pattern with process", "confusing the methods and goals of the emerging science of population genetics with those of the established science of taxonomy", which caused the traditional fundamental taxonomy to be disparaged, and consequently underfunded.
It is argued that some initiatives that aim to bypass the bottleneck of insufficient taxonomic expertise continue to draw funds away from solving the fundamental problem.

<doc id="36875996" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36875996" title="Allegiance (musical)">
Allegiance (musical)

Allegiance is a musical set during the Japanese American internment of World War II (with a framing story set in the present day) inspired by the personal experiences of George Takei (who also stars). It follows the story of the Kimura family in the weeks and years following Pearl Harbor, as they are relocated from their farm in Salinas, California to the Heart Mountain internment camp in the rural plains of Wyoming. The musical premiered September 2012 at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego.
It is expected to open on Broadway during the 2013-2014 season.
Conception of Allegiance.
In the fall of 2008, George Takei and his husband, Brad, were seated by complete coincidence next to Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione at an Off-Broadway show, where a brief conversation revealed a mutual love of theater. The very next day, the four were once again seated together at a Broadway show, "In The Heights". At intermission, Kuo and Thione approached George, curious as to why he had been so emotionally affected by the father's song ("Useless") in which he laments his inability to help his family. Over the course of that intermission, George recounted his personal experience as a child in the internment camps of America and his own father's sense of helplessness at his inability to protect his family that was mirrored in the song. Kuo and Thione felt that it would make a great show.
Production.
Allegiance had its first reading at the Japanese American National Museum on July 13, 2009 starring George Takei, Lea Salonga, and others. It was followed by two more readings that were held in New York in 2010 with the same two, but this time with Telly Leung and other cast members. In the summer of 2011, a workshop was held for Allegiance at the Old Globe itself. The Old Globe is Allegiance's world premiere and tryout.
Fundraising.
To commemorate Remembrance Day, the memorial for Japanese American Internment, George Takei took to Facebook to initiate a crowd funding campaign through IndieGoGo to raise funds for the show. The initial target was $50,000 - the eventual total raised exceeded $150,000.

John Bland (judge)

John Bland (? – c. 1825) was probably born in England and became notable in Canadian history for his time spent in Newfoundland.
Bland was probably active in Newfoundland as early as 1780 in a mercantile capacity. He became a magistrate at Bonavista, Newfoundland in 1790 and was active in commerce at that time. In 1801 he became a surrogate court judge which paid a regular salary. By that time he was well established in the community.
Bland is noteworthy for his advocacy on behalf of the Beothuk people during a documented period from 1797-1807 where his letters to various governors at St. Johns identify a number of issues and proposed solutions.

Gurubai Karmarkar returned to India in 1893 after receiving her medical degree. She worked for the 23 years at the American Marathi Mission, a Christian establishment, in Bombay, India. Her medical work focused mainly on the most disenfranchised members of the Indian caste system. A prominent group in her practice were women of all castes. In one letter to the Woman's board of missions, Dr. Karmarkar tells the stories of two "young child-wives" she treated over the past year. Both young woman suffered abuse from their husbands and in-laws. The first young wife had been branded on her foot to stop her from running away. The second wife was malnourished and was suffering from a severe fever. Dr. Karmarkar uses these two stories as a way to illustrate the plight of Indian women to her counterparts in the United States.

<doc id="36876180" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36876180" title="Tangendorf disc brooch">
Tangendorf disc brooch

The Tangendorf disc brooch is an Iron Age fibula from the 3rd century AD, which was dug up in 1930 from the sand of a Bronze Age tumulus near Tangendorf, Toppenstedt, Harburg, Lower Saxony, Germany. The front of the elaborately crafted garment fibula is decorated with a rear-facing four-legged animal, probably a dog or a deer. It is one of Harburg's most important finds from the period of the Roman Empire, and is in the permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum Hamburg in Harburg, Hamburg.
Discovery.
The Tangendorf disc brooch was found in 1930 in a tumulus (at ) on a parcel of land known as "" (in the black dorn), on the outer northwest corner of Tangendorf. While digging off sand from a Bronze Age grave mound in his field, farmer Heinrich Wille found the fibula together with a bronze hair clip (German: ) and a bronze spear blade. The hair clip and the spear blade were passed to the Helms-Museum; however, the brooch was left with a teacher of the Tangendorf elementary school.
In the summer of 1938 the teacher asked Helms-Museum's director Willi Wegewitz to pick up a neolithic stone axe. While handing over the stone axe the brooch was rediscovered in a drawer, among the school's exercise equipment. The teacher was considering disposing of the brooch because he thought it was simply a worthless modern object without any archaeological significance. Wegewitz immediately arranged an excavation of the tumulus. The mound's original diameter of was still clearly visible on the ploughed field and further remnants of a hair clip were discovered. The farmer revealed that he had found the brooch on the edge of the grave mound in the amount of the increased soil in sand; he had not noticed that "Erdverfärbungen" (earth discolorations), might indicate a cremation burial.
Findings.
The fibula is a multilayered structure. Its face consists of a very thin fire gilded and contoured silver disc, having a diameter of . This is fixed by three silver rivet pins to an identically sized, thick copper plate and together with this on a stronger silver plate. The rear plate, in diameter, is significantly larger. On its rear, the pin was mounted. The reverse of the front plate was filled with a now whitish green mix of tin, lead and traces of copper in order to support the sensitive friction work and to prevent the pressing of the driven ornaments. But the tin components of the filler have damaged some of the metal parts of the decoration due to allotropic processes forced by low temperatures during long term storage in the soil (tin pest). The decoration consists of a quadrupedal animal walking to the right, with the animals head facing backwards. It has two ears and a protruding tongue. Around its neck it wears a collar shaped ornament. The legs are positioned under the body to accommodate the round shape of the disc. The background is decorated with irregularly distributed impressions, imitating a granulation. The scene is framed by two ribbed bands, which are enclosed by an ornamental wreath and another ribbed band. Around the body of the animal there are three rosette shaped rivet heads. The body of the animal has a large defect caused by the degenerated tin filling. Some of the protruding edges of the rear mounting plate are broken away. Beneath the copper plate, residual amounts of organic material were found, which were interpreted as ivory. Due to typological comparisons of the ornaments, the fibula was dated to circa 300 AD.
Interpretation.
Due to the improper recovery without accurate documentation of the find, accurate statements can not be given about the archaeological context the disc brooch to the Iron Age burial and the Bronze Age secondary burial. It is also not known how many additional grave goods were lost. Compared to similar finds, all of these burials should have usually contained other jewellery and utensils. Based on the statements of farmer Wille, the Iron Age grave with the disc brooch was suspected to be a cremation burial, on top of a pre-existing burial mound, a suspicion which is supported from many other Iron Age grave findings. The brooch is a high-quality, most likely Germanic, goldsmiths' work, inspired by Roman models. The animal depicted is interpreted as a dog or an antler-less deer. The reason for the depiction of a rear-facing animal may be found in Germanic art conventions or it may based on mythological ideas, but it can also be attributed to the fact that it allows a larger depiction of the animal within the available space. The protruding edge of the rear silver disc and the remains of organic material beneath the copper disk suggests that the front plates of the fibula was surrounded by an ornate ring of ivory of about width.
Comparable artwork.
A similar, diameter, disc brooch is known from a burial at Häven in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, but depicts a forward-facing animal. The similarities in manufacture and decoration are so striking that Wegewitz believed they were produced in the same workshop. Parallels of the illustrated animal are known from archaeological finds on a silver goblet from Nordrup (near Skaftelev in Slagelse Municipality, Zealand (Denmark), a belt decoration plate from Skedemosse (Sweden), a drawing on a Quadi vessel shard of the 2nd century from Prikas, Olomouc, Moravia (Czech Republic), and on the gold bracteate of Ponsdorf Mistelbach District, Lower Austria. According to Willi Wegewitz the Tangendorf disc brooch is one of the most magnificent brooches of the period of the Roman Empire from northern Germany and Scandinavia.
Reconstruction.
After detailed analysis of the construction, Hans Drescher manufactured two reconstructions of the Tangendorf disc brooch, one copy for the Helms-Museum and the second for the Niedersächsisches Landesmuseum Hannover. Drescher used ivory for the organic ring, giving a decorative contrast between its white color and the golden disc. Drescher published his detailed findings in 1955.
Reception.
Since 2002, Toppenstedt has used a stylized representation of the brooch in its coat of arms.

The was established by Ogata No Saburo Koreyoshi in 1174 as a Samurai Clan of humble origins. The Clan's history is recorded in several references and was a long lasting clan that lived in Bungo, now called Oita Prefecture. The family's main recorded history dates to the "Tale of Genji" and "Okuninushi no Mikoto" which explains the legend and history of Ogata No Saburo Koreyoshi.
First English version.
Helen McCullough translated the first English version of "The Tale of the Heike" which gives us the first historical recording of Ogata No Saburo Koreyosh, his command of the largest armies and importance that played a key role in the Minamoto's taking control of Early Japan. Dawson and De Benniville's works also explain the historical recordings of the first Ogata Clan from Bungo. 
First Shogun.
The Ogata Clan made a huge impact in the beginning of the First Shogun's rule. They helped established the Oka Castle, and help solidify the region with the large armies that Ogata No Saburo Keriyoshi commanded. 
Late history.
Japanese history books do not record the Ogata Clan's quick rise and fall, as a clan that had made a huge impact, in a role that helped the Kamamura Period to be established. The Ogata Clan descendants remained samurai until the last epic battles in the Meiji Restoration. The last recorded samurai of the Ogata Clan was Ogata Shuntaro, who was MIA as the Samurai's fought to protect their heritage. Ogata Masanori of Tokyo who was originally raised in Kumamoto Japan, traced the lineage of the Ogata's back to Ogata No Saburo Koreyoshi. The first Ogata Clan was established in Bungo Japan. Many of Ogata No Saburo Koreyoshi's descendants have the same Kanji and writings as his last name can be found in Fukuoka and Kumamoto Japan. Many of his descendants now live in Hawaii, California, Brazil, and Georgia.

The Pinnacles, Dorset

The Pinnacles are two chalk formations, including a stack and a stump, located near Handfast Point, on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset, southern England.
Location.
The Pinnacles lie directly east of Studland, about 200 metres south of Old Harry Rocks and about 4 kilometres northeast of Swanage. The chalk headlands of the Ballard Downs are owned by the National Trust. The rocks can be viewed from the Dorset section of the South West Coastal Path.
Geography.
The downlands of Ballard Down are formed of chalk with some bands of flint, and were formed approximately 66 million years ago. The bands of stone have been gradually eroded over the centuries, some of the earlier stacks having fallen while new ones have been formed by the breaching of narrow isthmuses. Across the water to the east the Needles on the Isle of Wight are usually visible. These are also part of the same chalk band and only a few thousand years ago were connected to Ballard Down. 
To form the stacks, the sea gradually eroded along the joints and bedding planes where the softer chalk meets harder bedrock of the rock formations to create a cave. This eventually eroded right through to create an arch. The arch subsequently collapsed to leave the stacks calles The Pinnacles.

Lake Tangipahoa Dam

Lake Tangipahoa Dam is an embankment dam on the Tangipahoa River in Pike County, Mississippi. It forms Lake Tangipahoa within the Percy Quin State Park. The dam was completed in 1940 and in 1942 it failed. It was rebuilt in 1945 at a cost of $75,000. During the spring flood of 1983, the dam again failed and contributed to the flood records for the Tangipahoa River that stand today. The dam was rebuilt afterward and a concrete flood control structure was added. Heavy rainfall from Hurricane Isaac in August 2012 prompted the evacuation of 60,000 people downstream of the dam due to high reservoir levels and concerns of its stability. The lake was drained later in the month with plans to rebuild the dam.

She has performed 3 times at Auditorio Nacional in México City, along with Julieta Venegas in 2007, Belanova in 2008, and Juan Gabriel in 2009. She has performed in three Vive Latino Festivals in México City, first in 2006, in 2011, and again in 2014. She was named “Band of the Month” on Mtv Latin America in August 2006. Musicians in her band have varied with the years, and her current band is called The Black Pilgrims. Elis started her career in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico.
She has released 6 records to date, "Give Me Love" with Suave Records and distributed by Sony Music México in 2006, EP2 in 2007, "Express" distributed by EMI Music México in 2009, "Maldito" with Dragora Records and distributed by Warner Chapell in 2010, "Animal" with Dragora Records, and Adiós with Drágora Records in 2013. She also released the single "Love Love Love" in 2011 which is expected to be included in her next álbum. She was also a part of the tribute álbum Amo al Divo de Juarez with her versión of “Hasta Que Te Conocí” by Juan Gabriel, as well as the tribute album "" with her version of "No Tienes Nada Que Perder" by Mecano.
Early life.
Elis was born Erika Elizabeth Nogues on May 8, 1980 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, being the youngest of three children. As a child, she started training as an Olympic gymnast and as a dancer. Her father passed away when she was only 6. She moved to Texas with her family as a teenager in 1992 where she lived for one year. She and her family moved back to Guadalajara, and in 1994 Elis moved to Querétaro Mexico to her aunt’s. 
She shortened her name to Elis, inspired by Elis Regina.
Learning music.
After moving to Querétaro, her aunt and uncle started her in music lessons, as all of her cousins there were studying music. Elis has been known to say that what she really wanted was to continue with her dancing in the hopes of becoming a professional dancer. She started learning to play the Saxophone and music in general, but by a twist of fate some of her friends signed her up (unbeknownst to her) for a singing contest at her school in Querétaro, where she ended up in second place. It was there she realized that she wanted a career as a singer. 
Elis then moved back to Guadalajara where, a year later, she started singing for the local band La Verdad No Importa, from where she was later fired because she “didn’t sing that good”. After that rejection she began taking singing and guitar lessons in order to start writing her own songs.
In 2000, after being in a couple of more local bands, she started formal music studies at CEDART for a couple of years. While studying there, she held a job doing press and PR for different concert promoters in Guadalajara.
Music career.
2002-2003: First demos.
She interrupted her studies in 2002 and moved to London England for one year, where she began writing some of the songs she would later release as Elis Paprika. She held a job as a waitress during her stay in London. She returned to Guadalajara México in 2003 where she started a band called The Paprikas, with a local musician named Raul Velazquez (not to be confused with Raúl “Rul” Velazquez, who would later be Elis’ guitar player in The Black Pilgrims). At that point people began referring to her as “Elis from the Paprikas” or “Elis Paprika”,the name that she would later adopt artistically. After a few tries with The Paprikas, Elis recorded a demo for the song “Sunny Day”, working with Shaboomy and Eric Diaz, guitar player and bass player respectively from the band The Waitress from Guadalajara México. The Waitress was originally Elis’ first solo project. The name of the band was inspired by her time working as a waitress in London and Guadalajara before making music. Once she began to be recognized as “Elis Paprika” and making more music apart from her project, Elis left The Waitress. The other members of The Waitress continued without her.
2004: Enter "Elis Paprika".
In February 2004, Elis’ showed the demo of “Sunny Day”, to Luke Castillo, who was then playing guitar and singing for the band Becker. Luke instantly liked what he heard and they decided to start working together, and this is where Elis Paprika was formally established, with Luke Castillo on Guitar, Richo Acosta on Guitar, Chumino on Bass, and Chicho (also playing with the band Plastiko), on Drums. With this lineup, Elis recorded the demo for the song "Give Me Love". 
Chicho left the band and Arnold Benz briefly became the drummer. They recorded demo versions of the songs "Bitch" and "Texas" with him.
Arnold left the band and Richo Acosta called Willy Gonzalez, from another band he played in, to take over the drums.
Later, Jorge “Gordo” Miramontes came in on bass after Chumino left the band. At this point, and with this lineup, they all decided to work as a band instead of Elis being a solo artist. Elis Paprika Then became the name of the band. 
Their first live show as Elis Paprika took place in Guadalajara Jalisco México, on December 14, 2004 at the Hard Rock Café Guadalajara.
2005-2006: "Give Me Love".
Elis Paprika began playing in several venues and quickly ascended in Guadalajara’s rock scene. They played Sol Radiante Festival, Zapopum Festival, and the Hard Rock Live at the Hard Rock Café Guadalajara on several occasions. It was during one of these performances that people from Suave Records became interested in Elis Paprika, signing them in 2005. Under this label, Elis Paprika released the record "Give Me Love" in 2006, produced by Luke Castillo and Richo Acosta, and was licensed to Sony Music Mexico for its distribution in Mexico.
The first single, "Give Me Love", had a very fast and very big acceptance, and consequently Elis was invited to play at the Festival Vive Latino in 2006 and Corona Capital, also in 2006. In August of that same year, Elis Paprika was named “Band of the Month” on MTV. After this, MTV invited Elis Paprika to perform live for a recording of the program "Alerta".
The song "No Puedo" was released as the second single in October 2006 to an enormous reception by fans and critics. In November 2006 Julieta Venegas invited Elis Paprika to play on her first Auditorio Nacional performance in Mexico City.
As all of this was taking place, some contractual problems began to surface between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records.
2007–2008: Contractual problems, "EP2", and Juan Gabriel tribute.
After the success of "Give Me Love", problems between Elis Paprika and her then record label Suave Records got really bad, to the point where all the impulse they had came to a complete halt.
In early 2007, Elis requested Suave Records to let her go, alleging contractual violations when the label failed in some promotion, logistics and booking labors. A denial on behalf of the label followed which resulted in a lawsuit. At that point, and for the remainder of the lawsuit, Elis Paprika had to stop all promotion, and practically only had a couple of shows where she couldn’t get paid.
Luke Castillo decided to leave the band to concentrate on his other band Becker and Ramón "Zacky" Velarde became the guitar player in his place.
Elis recorded her voice for music in the short film, winner of the Festival de Cine de Morelia (Morelia Film Festival), "Jacinta" from director Karla Castañeda, with music by Gilberto Cervantes. "Jacinta" was also shown at the Cannes Film Festival that same year.
Elis Paprika recorded her "EP2" in 2007, but this second record did not see a formal and official launch due to the lawsuit with Suave Records. EP2 was released that same year, but only through direct download from the Internet, exclusively and completely free for her fans, as her way to maintain some sort of continuity and to stay out there, since she wasn’t able to formally promote and perform because of the lawsuit.
Early in 2008, Elis Paprika was invited to be a part of the Juan Gabriel tribute album called "Amo al Divo de Juárez". For this, Elis prepared her own version of the Juan Gabriel song "Hasta Que Te Conocí". The record came out, with her interpretation of the song as one of the official singles, with an enormous positive response for Elis Paprika, and this made her regain some of the impulse she had lost in the past year.
Elis Paprika also played that year for a big Green Peace event in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on their campaign against the killing of whales.
It wasn’t until late 2008 that Elis got released from her contract with Suave Records, which allowed her to, once again, concentrate on her band and her performances. She signed with new management under Zepeda Bros.
2009: "Express".
At the beginning of 2009, “Gordo” quit the band after a few differences, and was replaced, non officially, by “La Doña” on bass, who stayed with the band until early 2010.
Elis Paprika retook control over her career in 2009 and started again with new live performances and writing new songs, and in May of that year, entered the studio to record the songs that would eventually become her album “Maldito”, produced by Guido Laris. Originally intended to be released as two separate EP’s, the songs were recorded at Montecristo Studios in Mexico City, but once they were ready, the songs couldn’t be released until some time later, due to differences with her management, on the way to handle their promotion, as an independent release or a mainstream release with a Label.
That summer, Sony Music México invited Elis Paprika to be a part of "", a Mecano Tribute record, where she recorded her version of the song "No Tienes Nada Que Perder".
Juan Gabriel invited Elis to perform live with him on one of his concerts at Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City, to sing her version of "Hasta Que Te Conocí" live.
After being denied to release the songs she recorded that May, Elis Paprika entered the studio once more in Guadalajara at Richo Acosta's personal studio, who was then the band’s guitar player, to record new and previously unreleased songs. "Express" was released, produced by Richo Acosta, and licensed to EMI Music México for distribution, in October 2009, being this her first record to officially be promoted since "Give Me Love" in 2006. The first single from "Express" was "Tarde o Temprano" which received excellent reviews and public acceptance.
As "Express" was coming out, a few differences with the rest of her band began to surface.
2010-2011: Move to Mexico City, new band, and "Maldito".
As differences with her band escalated, Elis decided, in early 2010 right in the middle of promoting "Express", that she wouldn’t continue to work with the same musicians in her band. They went their separate ways and Elis went back to being a solo artist. This definitely interrupted the promotion of "Express", and things once again came to a complete halt.
Luke Castillo came back to play and support Elis on guitars, and had a major role in putting a band back together. Luke invited Paul Richards to play bass, and two other members of the band Aurum from Guadalajara, Vela and Luis Angel, to play guitar and drums respectively.
In May 2010, Elis moved to Mexico City in order to continue and better the handling of her career and to promote future plans. Working with Zepeda Bros. Elis decided to finally use the songs that had been recorded a year before, and since these songs had been on hold for over a year, it was decided that they were going to be released as one LP, instead of the two EPs they were originally ment for. It was precisely because of all the time that these songs were put on hold, that She named the LP "Maldito", which in Spanish means “Cursed”. She would refer to this album as “being cursed”, and that’s why she hadn’t put it out before.
Along with all of this, Elis began to make new acoustic performances of her songs in unplugged show, featuring Ernesto “Arbol” Licona from the band “Wapo?”, and Ana Lía Perez (her best friend), both on guitar. Ernesto Licona has been constantly playing guitar on Elis’ unplugged performances ever since.
That August, Vela and Luis Angel retook their labors with Aurum, and Elis invited Raul “Rul” Velazquez to play guitar, and Jimmy Strike, from the band Cherry Strike from Guadalajara to play drums. With this lineup, Elis played the 212 Festival by RMX, in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico, on September 12, 2010. This concert marked the beginning of her “Maldito Tour” in preparation for the launching of the new record.
That October, after a couple of shows, Jimmy leaves the band to retake activities with his band Cherry Strike, and Cachi Zazueta comes in to become the permanent drummer.
Maldito was officially released to the public in late November 2010 under Zepeda Bros., Warner Chappell México, and Drágora Records. It hit stores nationwide in Mexico and also on iTunes internationally. It quickly became a success, with good reviews by critics and great acceptance by fans, and became the number 1 selling record on iTunes México in January 2011.
The Maldito Tour went on until mid-2011, hitting practically every corner of Mexico. During this tour, Elis played the Vive Latino Festival for the second time, on March 8, 2011. Maldito, her “cursed” record, became the one to reposition her in Mexico’s Rock scene.
At the end of the Maldito Tour, in July 2011, Elis ended her working relationship with, her then management office, Zepeda Bros. and continued as a completely independent artist, handling her own management and Booking office. Elis recorded the single "Love Love Love" at Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco, produced by Luke Castillo, which was officially released on August 4, 2011, initially as a completely free download through Sound Cloud, as a "thank you" to all of her fans for the success of Maldito. It was later uploaded and sold through iTunes exclusively. "Love Love Love" is part of the Chilean movie "Que Pena Tu Boda"s soundtrack, as the main credits theme, and received over 10,000 downloads in the first week of the soundtrack’s release in Chile, which allowed Elis to make an important debut in South America.
In October 2011, Elis along with Rul and Cachi, from her band, got together in her home in Guadalajara to begin bouncing around ideas, and, within a week, had the songs that would become the record "Animal". That same month, they entered Suite 21 Studios in Guadalajara Jalisco to record the songs, produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez.
2012-2013: "Animal".
Elis began 2012 with the release of "Animal" in February 2012 produced by Luke Castillo, and Rul Velazquez, under Drágora Records. For this record, her band since the Maldito Tour of 2010-2011, adopted the name The Black Pilgrims. The song "Animal" was launched as the first single.
In January 2012, Luke Castillo left the band once again, to concentrate on his studio work, and was replaced by Stepha Campbell, a personal friend of drummer Cachi, on guitars. In July 2012, Paul Richards also left the band. After playing with a couple of substitute bass players for a few months, Dylan Deville formally joined The Black Pilgrims in November 2012. By the end of 2012, Rul Velazquez left The Black Pilgrims to join Siddartha's band full-time. In January 2013, Cristian Hernandez officially joined Elis Paprika & The Black Pilgrims on guitars.
Continuing with the impulse they’ve had since promoting Maldito, Elis Paprika & The Black Pilgrims make their 2012-2013 “Animal Tour”. on February 1, 2013 the official video for their second single off of the record ANIMAL, "En Mi Cabeza" was released.
On March 12, 2013 Dapuntobeat's record "I/O" was released, where Elis is featured handling vocals on track #9 "Interzona". On March 16, 2013 Elis sang "Interzona" live with Dapuntobeat at the 2013 Vive Latino Festival in Mexico City.
In early April 2013, Stepha Campbell left The Black Pilgrims and Elis announced the band was having auditions. After auditioning a few guitar players, Adan Ruiz landed the job, his first gig with the band being in Hermosillo Mexico on June 1, 2013.
2013-2014: "Adios".
During the summer of 2013, Elis began to give hints about her next record during interviews. This record would be a compilation, containing Singles from her entire career, as well as "a few surprises", and a couple of new songs. On August 27, 2013 the song "Canción de Amor Para los 3" was released as the first single of her record ADIOS. The official video for the song "Canción de Amor Para Los 3" was released on September 30, 2013. The record "Adiós" was officially released the night of October 22, 2013.
On December 9, 2013 it was announced that Elis Paprika, along with her Black Pilgrims, were officially part of the XV Vive Latino Festival in Mexico City, as part of her 10th anniversary tour in 2014. This marks her third appearance at Vive Latino.
The official video for the song "Adiós", the second single from the record with the same name, was released on February 13, 2014.
Elis Paprika & The Black Pilgrims began their "Adiós" tour on March 28, 2014 at the Vive Latino Festival in Mexico City.

I think that the cost of foreign invasion of Syria, if it happened, would be greater than one that the whole world can afford. Because if there were problems in Syria, particularly as we are the last bastion of secularism, stability and coexistence in the region, it will have a domino impact that will affect the world from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. And you know its implications on the rest of the world. I do not think that the West is moving in this direction, but if they do, no one can predict what will happen after. I'm not a puppet, and I was not made by the West to go to the West or to any other country. I am Syrian, I was made in Syria and to live and die in Syria."

The Russian navy is also deploying five ships, a destroyer, tugboat, tanker and two large amphibious landing vessels to the port of Tartus. The port at Tartus is the only Russian naval base outside of the former Soviet Union. The deployment of the two amphibious landing vessels is a possible indication that the Russian government is considering a large scale evacuation of Russian citizens in Syria.

Neoclassical architecture in Milan

Neoclassical architecture in Milan encompasses the main artistic movement from about 1750 to 1850 in this northern Italian city. From the final years of the reign of Maria Theresa of Austria, through the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and the European Restoration, Milan was in the forefront of a strong cultural and economic renaissance in which Neoclassicism was the dominant style, creating in Milan some of the most influential works in this style in Italy and across Europe. Notable developments include construction of the Teatro alla Scala, the restyled Royal Palace, and the Brera institutions including the Academy of Fine Arts, the Braidense Library and the Brera Astronomical Observatory. Neoclassicism also led to the development of monumental city gates, new squares and boulevards as well as public gardens and private mansions. Latterly two churches, San Tomaso in Terramara and San Carlo al Corso, were completed in Neoclassical style before the period came to an end in the late 1830s.
Introduction.
The Treaty of Rastatt in 1714, formalized the transfer of Milan from Spanish to Austrian rule. During the reign of Maria Theresa (1740–1780) and Joseph II (1765–1790), the city led a cultural and economic renaissance. The empress and her son, strongly influenced by the ideals of Enlightenment, played a significant role in the movement of reform. Thanks to its enlightened government and reforms, Milan was open to developments from Europe, quickly becoming a lively intellectual centre. As a result, influential proponents of the new styles such as Pietro and Alessandro Verri and Cesare Beccaria arose. It was also the seat of the forward-looking newspaper "Il Caffè" and of the "Accademia dei Pugni". The reforms covered important areas of interest to the public, especially the modern system of land registry, one of the most efficient in Europe. Between 1765 and 1785, Joseph II reduced the powers of the religious orders. The inquisition was abolished, meetings of religious orders including those of the Jesuits were forbidden and their assets were transferred to the city where they were used for unprecedented urban renewal programmes. Coordinated by the court architect Giuseppe Piermarini, Neoclassicism became the style of the city's rebirth. The first public parks were opened while elegant mansions inspired by the new trend were built in carefully selected areas. Some of Milan's most famous institutions such as the Teatro alla Scala, the Brera cultural centre and the reformed Palatine Schools were created during this period.
In 1796, with Napoleon's arrival in Italy, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria left the city which from 1800 came into the hands of the French. French domination did not deter Milan's cultural activities. The rapidly growing population included some of the greatest Italian intellectuals from Melchiorre Gioia to Vincenzo Monti, and Alessandro Volta to Ugo Foscolo and Silvio Pellico. The Lombard Institute of Science and Letters was founded and several newspapers were established in the city. For the capital of the Kingdom of Italy as it now became, numerous urban projects were prepared with a view to giving Milan the look of one of Europe's main capitals although they were never completed. For some time the inhabitants had drawn up petitions for dismantling the Sforza Castle and by his decree of 23 June 1800, Napoleon ordered its demolition. This was indeed begun in 1801 but was never completed. The same year the architect Giovanni Antonio Antolini was charged with designing a "Foro Bonaparte" (Bonapart Forum) but instead he suggested remodeling the castle in the Neoclassical style. As a result of its high costs, the project was however shelved. By decree in 1807, Milan and Venice were endowed with a "Commissione di Ornato" (Embellishment Committee) with vast powers and a wide sphere of activity. It was made up of the most prominent figures in Milan. The first item to be discussed was a master plan which was drafted the same year. Until 1814, the city's development was governed by the plan which "can be considered one of the most modern plans created in Europe.".
With the return of the Austrians in 1815, the city completed its cultural and economic success. Commercial and financial activities made Milan Italy's main business centre. Furthermore, thanks to the completion of many irrigation projects coordinated by the government, Milanese agriculture was among the most modern and best developed in Europe. At the same time, the city became the largest publishing and cultural centre of Italy with the involvement of figures including Carlo Cattaneo, Cesare Cantù and Carlo Tenca. Milan developed Neoclassical works in both the private and public domains: firstly as a result of the strong link between the Enlightenment and Neoclassical art, especially publicly funded architecture, and secondly the role that architecture played in celebrating the Neoclassical revolution and Napoleon's exploits. They inevitably came to an end with the Restoration. Neoclassicism began a slow decline, passing through periods of Romanticism and Eclecticism, but nevertheless leaving a great legacy. Indeed, during this flourishing period, the foundations were laid for Milan later to become the economic capital and, in certain periods, also the cultural capital of a united Italy.
Characteristics.
The Neoclassical period in Milan can be divided into three phases corresponding to three historical periods for the city in the 18th and 19th centuries: the Austrian period of Enlightenment, the Napoleonic years and the Restoration.
In Milan, Neoclassicism began a few years later than in its main European counterparts, mainly as a result of the problems of succession to the thone of the Austrian empire, with Maria Theresa's lengthy reign. Initially, Neoclassicism in Milan, like the artists who practiced it, was not so much inspired by the classical models of Ancient Rome or Roman Neoclassicism as by developments in London, Paris and Parma. It was a period of great public works covering theatres, libraries and schools, and more generally of important works for the public good, reflecting the ambitions of an enlightened government. It was a period in which the State and the government itself led the city's cultural life and progress, promoting and funding new activities and rewarding the most deserving citizens and achievements. During this initial period, Neoclassicism was characterized by a more sober and austere approach, resulting in symmetrical, well-ordered structures.
The Napoleonic period, while demonstrating some continuity in reinitiating work suspended under the Austrian government, was also characterized by a more monumental and celebratory style, striving to promote Milan as one of the great European capitals with Eclectic and Romantic architectural features. In particular, outstanding new roads and city gates were completed. There were plans for a considerable number of projects designed to enhance the appearance of the city and to celebrate the victories of Bonaparte. However, as a result of the short period of French rule and the over ambitious nature of some of the works, they were largely set aside.
With the Restoration and the return of the Austrians, there was something of a revival of the previous Neoclassical style, although the progressive approach of enlightened governments was now coming to an end. During this period, sculpture and painting took on a primary role, promoted by annual festivals and competitions. The State had a less secular approach than in the two previous periods, initiating work on the restoration and renewal of churches, especially their interiors. After the early years of the Restoration, pure Neoclassicism became more a style of the past. The work of many artists began to reveal trends towards the Romantic art which would follow a few years later. By the late 1830s, it could clearly be seen that the era of Milanese Neoclassicism had now come to an end.
Major works.
For the first time since the Renaissance, urban planning was designed to renew the city in its entirety. There was a clear break with earlier developments which had produced works of great artistic value but which were separated from each other and often built on the initiative of private individuals. The city's development was now rationally planned on the basis of strict criteria, always under the supervision of the Ornato Committee. Some of the works are remarkable in their own right for their high artistic or cultural value.
Royal Palace.
When the Austrians arrived in Milan, the Royal Palace, the city's seat of power, was antiquated and totally unsuited to accommodate the court of a city destined to become the second largest in the Austrian Empire. On his own initiative, Archduke Ferdinand, Maria Theresa's son, strove to give the court a fitting seat. The new palace would bring prestige to the city while providing a suitable home for the court. The initial plans were for a new palace with a rectangular plan between the canals and the western city gate but it was later decided to restore the old palace. Luigi Vanvitelli, who was invited to coordinate the work, submitted three proposals which were all turned down owing to their high cost. In 1769, Vancitelli entrusted the project to his young pupil Giuseppe Piermarini who gave the palace its present look.
Wishing to open up the square, Piermarini first demolished one of the old wings before concentrating on the renovation of the building's exterior. The result is a sober two-storey facade. The first floor contains windows with small stone cornices and a small bugnato ashlar socle while the other two have pilasters along the full length of the facade with tympanum windows, alternatingly triangular and curved. The interiors were then completely renewed. The entrance leads into the courtyard with its monumental Baroque staircase. To complete this part of the palace, the facade of the Church of San Gottardo in Corte had to be demolished while use was also made of the adjoining square. The most renowned artists, decorators and cabinet makers of the period were called upon to design the furniture and decorations. The external structure was completed in 1778 but work on the interior continued for several years.
Brera.
In 1773, after the abolition of the order of the Jesuits, the city was able to make use of the Palazzo Brera where the order had been housed. It was decided it should be transformed from a religious structure into a public building. Several institutions were able to make use of the building. Within a few years, the Academy of Fine Arts and the Braidense Library were founded while the astronomical observatory, which was initially just moved into the palace, became the modern Brera Astronomical Observatory while the Brera Botanical Garden was established on the site of the Jesuits' herb garden. In 1774, Giuseppe Piermarini, who was entrusted with the renovation project, designed a new wing and provided a new facade with a monumental entrance flanked by Doric columns and surmounted by a balcony. Functional improvements were also carried out with alterations to the library, in order to cope with an increasing number of books, and with the addition of greenhouses in the garden. In 1784, the extensions were completed apart from a few minor tasks carried out by Leopoldo Pollack from Vienna.
With the arrival of Napoleon, the fine arts academy officially became the National Academy with the foundation of the Pinacoteca di Brera gallery. In 1806, Pietro Gilardoni's plans provided more space for the gallery. In addition to new facilities for the observatory, space was made available for the Lombard Institute of Science and Letters while greenhouses were designed for the botanical garden. As part of the planning for additional space, the facade of the Church of Santa Maria in Brera was demolished and the interior was reworked in Neoclassical style in order to accommodate the "Sale Napoleoniche" or Napoleonic Hall. In 1811, the Righetti brothers created the bronze statue of Napoleon based on Antonio Canova's marble original which had been commissioned for the Palazzo del Senato. With the return of the Austrians, further changes were undertaken with a view to providing improved functionality and better educational facilities.
The Scala.
In 1775, a fire had destroyed the Royal Theatre which was located in one of the palace wings. The boxholders association together with Archduke Ferdinand seized the opportunity to build a prestigious new theatre. Charged with its design in 1776, Giuseppe Piermarini immediately decided not to use the old site but rather the ground made available after the closure of the convent of Santa Maria della Scala, hence the name Teatro alla Scala. Brick rather than wood was chosen as the building material and the number of rows of boxes was increased to six. Additional rooms were included for various functions: there was a dance hall, a gaming room, workshops, cafes and restaurants. An extremely innovative feature, at least as far as Italian theatres were concerned, was the addition of an entrance for carriages. Access was further facilitated by widening the street now known as Santa Redegonda which had been an narrow old winding lane.
The building was constructed in three sections to fulfill the established criteria. The first section, projecting outwards, had various workshops, cloakrooms and the foyer on the ground floor while upstairs it had a restaurant and a scenography studio. The second section housed the theatre proper. The boxes contained separate dressing rooms while the audience area was flat so that the hall could also be used as a ballroom. The third section, the stage, was designed in three sweeps with two lateral compartments large enough for backstage requirements. In his design for the horseshoe-shaped auditorium, Piermarini was inspired by the architecture of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples but changed the degree of curvature so as to improve visibility and the acoustics. The acoustics were further enhanced by a number of subsequent modifications. For the ceiling, a finely decorated wooden facing served as a natural sounding board, ensuring almost perfect sound in every part of the hall. It was considered to be among the best of the times. Another little trick was to reduce significantly the size of the usually huge columns separating the various stages. For the hall's decor, Piermarini worked with prominent artists such as Giuseppe Levati and Giocondo Albertolli while also consulting the poet Giuseppe Parini. The theatre underwent many alterations during the Napoleonic period after which it lost its Neoclassical interiors as a result of work carried out by artists such as Francesco Hayez.
The front of the theatre was the part for which Piermarini showed most concern. The result can still be seen today. The lower level, in a granite bugnato ashlar, has a terrace with a three-arched porch while the upper level is decorated with a double row of columns crowned by an entablature. Finally the attic, with pilasters rather than columns, is surmounted by a series of torch-bearing vases. Its central pediment has a stucco bas-relief by Giuseppe Franchi representing the allegory of the chariot of the sun chased by the night. Dating from 1828, the body of the building beside the original structure was designed by the engineer Domenico Giusto. In 1858, after the demolition of several minor buildings, the Scala Square was completed, changing the view of the facade envisaged by Piermarini who had intended it to be seen from a much tighter perspective. Like much of the city, the theatre suffered during the allied bombing in the Second World War but was one of the first buildings to be repaired.
Renovation of the ramparts.
In the city's Neoclassical transformations, great importance was given to the renovation of the city wall which was no longer needed for defensive purposes. It was converted into scenic walkways while the former customs houses were redesigned as striking monuments.
The East Gate gardens.
One of the most substantial developments was the area around the Porta Orientale, now known as the Porta Venezia. It was particularly important among the modernization works carried out by the Austrians as it was located on the road to Vienna. The city's first public gardens, now known as the Giardini Pubblici Indro Montanelli, were developed here.
Once again it was Giuseppe Permarini who was given the task of planning the gardens. They were initially intended to serve the new royal palace which was to be built in the area but when it was decided instead to renovate the existing palace, the development became part of the Public Gardens Plan. Now somewhat scaled down, the gardens were built in an area vacated by the removal of two convents and on land which had belonged to the Dugnani Elvetico family. A network of paths through the gardens and on to the adjacent streets included the "Boschetti" and the steps on the Via Vittorio Veneto which first led up to the ramparts and then into the park. Although the park's present appearance is mainly the result of replanning the park as an English garden at the end of the 19th century, Piermarini's Neoclassical influence is still in evidence on the path connecting the "Boschetti" to the steps down to the Via Vittorio Veneto. The site of one of the former convents was first redesigned as a venue for ball games and then used for city celebrations held by the governor Eugenio Beauharnais. It was finally demolished to provide space for the Milan's Natural History Museum ("Museo di Storia Naturale").
Beside the "Boschetti", there is another garden, that of the Villa Belgiojoso Bonaparte. The villa, a commission which Piermarini received from Count Barbiano, was entrusted to his student Leopoldo Pollack who in 1790 designed a building in the style of a Lombard villa with a rear facade overlooking the garden while the outside facade was profoundly different. The facade on the street was much simpler: the main section together with two lateral components contained the entrance court which was separated from the street by three arches supported by Ionic Columns. The central part was decorated with a slightly projecting loggia with Doric columns supporting a cornice and a balustrade decorated with statues of pagan gods. The facade overlooking the garden, much more carefully designed over two levels, has a ground floor in bugnato ashlar while the two upper floors feature Doric columns with separate windows free of gables but with cornices of mythological bas-reliefs. Here too, there are two less-protruding lateral sections, surmounted by triangular gables with bas-reliefs representing the allegories of "Il carro del Giorno" and "Il carro della Notte". Like his master when decorating the Scala, Pollack was assisted by Giuseppe Parini in choosing the decoration themes but the innovative approach was that the villa was to be designed in accordance with the requirements of the surrounding English garden.
Apart from some minor additions in the Romantic style, the interior is Neoclassical. Of particular note are the main hall on the first floor overlooking the garden and decorated with Corinthian columns and stucco, and the dining room with frescoes of "Parnassus" by Andrea Appiani from 1811. The park is the first example of an English garden in Milan. The plants were randomly arranged and the ground was heightened. Paths ran along streams and round a pond fed with water from a nearby canal. There was also a small mock ruin of a monopteros temple. During the Napoleonic period, the garden was used for celebrations and banquets. As the owner seldom used the building, it was soon sold by the Cisalpine Republic and donated to Napoleon who transferred it to the governor Eugenio Beauharnais and his wife. When the Austrians returned, the residence was used by the governors before it came under the ownership of the House of Savoy with the unification of Italy. The royal family often stayed there and, as a result, in 1921 the commune made it the home of
the Gallery of Modern Art.
Ramparts and city gates.
With the development of modern warfare, the walls of cities across Europe had become useless. As elsewhere, Milan began the demolition of its ramparts, replacing them with paths or simply empty space. The city gates, once the only entrances to the walled city, were torn down to make way for striking new structures inspired by the triumphal arches of Ancient Rome.
Of all the city gates and triumphal arches built during the Neoclassical period, the most famous and monumental is certainly the Arco della Pace. It was built during the Kingdom of Italy period at the end of the Corso Sempione road, the principal axis connecting the city to France under whose dependency the Kingdom came. Designed by Luigi Cagnola, construction began in 1805 only to be suspended a few years later. It was completed in 1816 at the instigation of Francis I of Austria. He called it the arch for European peace which had been achieved the previous year at the Congress of Vienna. The arch consists of three fornices with four giant order Corinthian columns. The entablature depicts allegories of the main rivers of the region, the Po, Ticino, Adige and Tagliamento, sculpted by Pompeo Marchesi. On top is a group of bronze sculptures from designs by Luigi Cagnola. The Chariot of Peace ("Sestiga della Pace"), representing Napoleon's victories, was originally designed to face the Corso Sempione but was later repositioned to overlook the city. Similarly, the arch's bas-reliefs were intended to depict Napoleon's exploits but when work began, under the influence of the Austrians, some of the scenes were changed to represent episodes from the Restoration and the Congress of Vienna while others depicting Napoleon were replaced with heads resembling Francis I. The customs offices on either side of the Arco della Pace date from 1838.
Quite differently designed by Piermarini in 1787 was the Porta Orientale, later renamed the Porta Venezia. Its two customs houses were completed by Rodolfo Vantini in 1828. Characterized by three Doric portals on the outer side facing the ramparts, they have a much more monumental look than the other customs houses in Milan and are also far more ornate. The decorations include Carrara marble statues and bas-reliefs with scenes from the history of Milan sculpted by various artists including Pompeo Marchesi and Gaetano Monti.
Not far from the Porta Venezia is the Porta Nuova, the work of Giuseppe Zanoia, completed in 1812 in a design inspired by Rome's Arch of Titus. Here it is interesting to note that the two customs offices have been integrated into the body of the arch. As sandstone was used for the project, the original decorations have been seriously worn. Nevertheless, some of the figures sculpted by Camillo Pacetti and Luigi Acquisti remain in excellent condition. Also in the vicinity is the single-arched Porta Garibaldi, until 1860 called the Porta Comasina, which was designed by Giacomo Moraglia in 1807. The customs houses were added in 1836. Its less monumental proportions are better suited to the surrounding streets as the gate was at the end of a road with several bends, hardly compatible with a grandiose project.
The far more imposing Porta Ticinese completed in 1817 is based on an even grander design by Luigi Cagnola. It has a rather simplistic appearance with symmetrical frontages towards the city and the countryside consisting of an Ionic peristasis supporting a triangular tympanum in pink Baveno granite. Initiated under French rule and completed under the Austrian Restoration, like the Arco della Pace it underwent a number of modifications. The name changed from Porta Marengo (in memory of the Battle of Marengo to its present name with an inscription calling for peace between nations. The Porta Vercellina, later named the Porta Magenta and demolished in 1885, was built and designed by Luigi Canonica in 1805 It was a triumphal arch with a single fornix flanked by two rows of Ionic columns and decorated with bas-reliefs in 1859.
Neoclassical districts.
From the mid 18th century, much of the city underwent a radical transformation, especially the streets. Under Austrian rule, the significance of the various axes changed with the result that many of the city's sinuous streets were rebuilt and frequently straightened out. These new axes led to the development of new districts with a considerable number of Neoclassical buildings, many of which can still be seen today.
Corso di Porta Orientale.
The district most affected by Neoclassical works was certainly the area surrounding the Porta Orientale. In addition to the monumental works described above, many private residences were built in the Neoclassical style. The main street through the district, also called the Porta Orientale quarter, was in fact the road linking Milan and Vienna. Located quite close to the city centre, with its convent parks and private gardens the district became popular for new buildings housing Milan's nobility.
The first building completed in the area was the Palazzo Serbelloni. Simone Cantoni received the commission from the renowned Serbelloni family. He opted for a rather sober style except for the central section consisting of a central portico with a parapet and giant order Ionic columns, all enclosed within two pilasters separating the monumental section from the facade of the less decorative part. A bas-relief depicting episodes from Milanese history divides the upper and lower floors. Inside, it is worth mentioning the great hall, decorated by Giocondo Albertolli and Giuseppe Maggiolini, used by Napoleon when he was in Milan, and the ballroom decorated by Giuliano Trabellesi.
Facing the gardens near the Palazzo Serbelloni and the customs houses is another perfect example of a Neoclassical residence, the Palazzo Saporiti. Commissioned by Gaetano Belloni, manager of the gaming room at the Scala, it was designed by Innocenzo Giusti. The building is a typical Neoclassical residence. On the ground floor level, the symmetrical facade is decorated with a bugnato ashlar in pink granite while the first floor features a portico with Ionic columns from which parades in the street below could be viewed. Between the first floor and the attic, there is a series of bas-reliefs depicting scenes from the history of Milan, while the attic itself is crowned with classical statues of the Dii Consentes sculpted by Pompeo Marchesi and Grazioso Rusca.
Other examples of Neoclassical residences include the Palazzo Bovara, home of the French embassy during the Cisalpine Republic and used by Stendhal during his lengthy stays in Milan, as well as the Palazzo Amati in the Via della Spiga. On a side street from the Corso Venezia, the aforementioned Villa Reale can be seen.
Del Monte district.
In the early 19th century, the area around the Via Montenapoleone, a road which dates back to Roman times, was known as the Del Monte district. It was also modernized in accordance the trends of the times. Of the many buildings in the area, the one which most clearly reflects the Neoclassical style is certainly the Palazzo Melzi di Cusano built in 1830 by the engineer Giovanni Bareggi. The facade is obviously inspired by Simone Cantoni's Palazzo Serbelloni with a central section made up of giant Ionic columns surrounding a small portico surmounted by an entablature and a pediment decorated with bas-reliefs. Separating the lower and upper windows, there is a bas-relief by Gaetano Monti representing the "businesses" of Francesco Sforza. Still preserved inside the building are Neoclassical medallions depicting personalities of the period and a meeting room decorated with stucco and frescoes depicting scenes of Ancient Rome.
The Palazzo Taverna, a late Neoclassical building completed in 1835 by Ferdinando Albertolli, is notable in that it is reminiscent of the Royal Villa or, more generally, country houses as the main body of the building is set back to form a courtyard overlooking the street. The entrance consists of an Ionic colonnade supporting a parapet. The two lateral sections have giant pilasters surmounted by triangular tympani.
The Palazzo Gavazzi, typical of the mansions built during the Restoration period, was designed by Luigi Clerichetti in 1838. Each floor bears its own decorations: Doric columns on the ground floor and various pilasters on the first and second floors, rather than the huge decorative works which were popular at the time. The symmetrical facade is centred on a portal with four Ionic half-columns supporting the first-floor balcony. The residence was the home of Carlo Cattaneo.
Corsia dei Giardini and surroundings.
Now called the Via Manzoni, this street was another artery where Neoclassical residences were completed after the nearby Scala Theatre brought new prestige to the area. It was not long before the street was favoured by the nobility for new homes.
Not directly on the street but a short distance away on one of the side streets stands the Palazzo Belgioioso, one of the masterpieces of Milan's Neoclassical architecture. The building is certainly one of the finest examples of the Neoclassical citizens' residences and was a haunt of Milan's intellectuals. It was designed in 1772 by Giuseppe Piermarini who in this instance abandoned the sober and austere style of early Neoclassicism, building an imposing and highly decorated mansion which dominates the street. Here too, the most lavishly decorated part of the facade is the slightly protruding central section with a series of four giant columns, an entablature and a tympanum enclosed by pilasters. The ground floor is finished in rusticated bugnato ashlar, the first floor, separated from the second with bas-reliefs of heraldic symbols, has windows crowned with garlands and decorative mouldings. Some of the rooms still have period decorations, the most famous of which are the gallery decorated with frescoes by Martin Knoller and stuccos by Giocondo Albertolli. Rinaldo's room, also decorated by Knoller, was inspired by Torquato Tasso's epic poem Jerusalem Delivered.
Opposite the Palazzo Belgioioso, is the less impressive Palazzo Besana whose Palladian facade consists of eight Ionic columns.
At 10 Via Manzoni, the Palazzo Anguissola constructed between 1775 and 1778 with particular attention to the interior garden, soon changed hands and in 1829 the exterior was reworked by Luigi Canonica who gave it the finish it maintains today. More ornate than most Milanese Neoclassical buildings, the facade consists of Corinthian pilasters terminating in a frieze with a musical relief clearly inspired by the nearby Scala. The ground floor is however faced with smooth blocks of granite.
Also on the Via Manzoni, Canonica's Palazzo Brentani has a sober Neoclassical facade with medallions of illustrious Italians. The more austere Palazzo Borromeo d'Adda is from the late Neoclassical period. On the continuation of the Via Manzoni, in the old Contrada della Cavalchina, stands the Palazzo Melzi d'Eril, once known for its private garden, said to have been one of the most beautiful in Milan. As a result of successive subdivisions, it was lost in the 1930s.
Corsia dei Servi and surroundings.
The Corsia dei Servi, now the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, was the site of significant Neoclassical renovations after the Restoration. The developments were mainly private although they were regulated by the Ornato Commission. Today, a small section of the street still retains its Neoclassical look although the area underwent a series of changes over the following century, finally suffering bombings during the Second World War and subsequent reconstruction.
A rather unusual occurrence in Milan's artistic development was the reworking of the Piazzo del'Antico Verziere, the fruit market, which was centred around the construction of a fountain. It was completed in 1781 by the sculptor Giuseppe Franchi to a design by Piermarini with statues of mermaids and dolphins. Strangely, the square was never given a proper name, simply being called the Piazza Fontana (Fountain Square). The square was completed by the reconstruction of the facade of the Archbishop's Palace in 1784, again assigned to Piermarini. Keeping the old portal designed by Pellegrino Tibaldi, he simply added square windows, crowned with triangular tympani on the first floor, and added a new socle on the ground floor while creating a string course on the first floor.
Among the few remaining Neoclassical residences is the Palazzo Tarsis built by Luigi Clerichetti between 1836 and 1838. With a ground floor faced in rusticated bugnato, the first floor has a portico of Corinthian columns while the top floor, subsequently heightened, presents statues by Pompeo Marchesi.
The street is also the site of San Carlo al Corso (Milan) which is described below. Its construction in 1839 was later seen to coincide with the end of Milan's Neoclassical period.
Religious buildings.
As already explained, the first two Neoclassical periods were almost completely devoted to the construction of secular buildings. Religious developments during the reign of Maria Theresa and the Napoleonic period were limited to alterations to the interiors of existing churches. The only significant religious works therefore belong to the Restoration phase when the Congress of Vienna brought about a rapprochement between church and state. Two sites exist, each modelled on two classical designs, one based on a rectangular Greek temple with a porch, the other with a central plan inspired by the Pantheon in Rome.
The Greek example is the church of San Tomaso in Terramara which had existed since the 11th century but whose appearance was completely changed between 1825 and 1827. The facade is made up of a portico of six Ionic columns supporting a triangular pediment which partly hides a semicircular window.
The Roman design is that of San Carlo al Corso built in 1839 by Carlo Amati, the city's largest church of the period. Built to a centrally-planned design, it has a typical gable-tympanum front with Corinthian half-columns and alternating niches and windows. The church forms part of a portical-lined square resulting from the demolition of the old Santa Maria dei Servi convent.
Despite its imposing appearance, the diameter is in fact a little less than that of the Pantheon, a factor which led to considerable criticism of the architect. The interiors are richly decorated in a pure Neoclassical style with groups of statues by Pompeo Marchesi and frescoes by Angelo Inganni. The impressive hemispherical dome has a coffered ceiling.
The church is the city's last major Neoclassical project. Even as the building was being completed, new architectural styles had already begun to emerge. For example, the Cristoforis Gallery with its glass and wrought iron facing was completed in 1832. Thus, apart from a few minor eclectic works, San Carlo al Corso can be said to be the city's last Neoclassical venture. The minor works include the church of Sant'Antonio Abate, the facade and the interiors of San Gottardo in Corte and, above all, Andrea Appiani's frescoes in Santa Maria presso San Celso.
Unrealized projects.
During Milan's second period of Neoclassicism, architects were charged with giving Milan the look of the new capital cities emerging in Europe. By far the most ambitious project was the Foro Bonaparte, planned in 1801 by Giovanni Antolini. Inspired by the Roman Forum and by the works of the French architect Claude Nicolas Ledoux, plans were drawn up for a development in the vicinity of Sforza Castle consisting of a circular piazza with a diameter of some 500 metres bordered by administrative buildings, ministries, court houses, baths, theatres, universities and museums. There were also plans for large areas to be devoted to commerce, the stores being connected through a system of canals to the city's Navigli. The main objective of the ambitious project was to move the city centre from the Piazza del Duomo, then surrounded by narrow medieval streets, to the newly planned Foro which would thus become the hub of city life. Evaluated and modified several times by a special commission, the plans finally shelved owing to the sheer grandeur of the project. Although Napoleon was strongly behind it, it was finally deemed too ambitious for a city the size of Milan. The Foro Bonaparte plans were however not completely abandoned: once Antolini's design had been set aside, the project was entrusted to Luigi Canonica who completely reworked it into developing the area essentially for private residences. Antolini's original plans were however considered to be one of the most important endeavors of Neoclassical architecture, so much so that the Foro Bonaparte was soon to inspire Naples' semicircular Piazza del Plebiscito with the church of San Francesco di Paola.
In addition to the ambitious Foro Bonaparte project, there were also plans for an important development near the Corso di Porta Ticinese. Entrusted to Cagnola in 1801, the project covered a monumental gateway in today's Piazza XXIV Maggio, straightening the Corso di Porta Ticinese, creating buildings with arcades along the road and constructing a monumental bridge over the canal. Here too the project was deemed too burdensome. The only outcome was a modified Porta Ticinese.
As for other unrealized works, a committee including Cagnola and Canonica, drew up a further plan around the early Neoclassical styles. The Brera Academy published open competitions for an orphanage (1805), a school (1806), a covered market (1808), an art gallery (1810), a prison (1811), public baths (1812) and a cemetery (1816). As a result of the end of the Kingdom of Italy (1805–1814) and the termination of regulatory planning, the works were never completed.

F (Sphinx) Parachute Battery RHA

F (Sphinx) Parachute Battery Royal Horse Artillery is a Close Support Battery of 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery currently based in Merville Barracks in Colchester.
History.
Creation.
The Battery was raised in India in 1800 as an experimental Brigade of Horse Artillery. They were immediately sent to Egypt to join the force that was operating against Napoleon’s Army.
The Troop sailed to the Red Sea coast where they marched across the desert. This took a heavy toll on the troops and particularly on their horses and by the time they reached the Nile the guns were being towed by camels.
The Troop sailed up the Nile to Giza, home of the Sphinx, where they were encamped on the Isle of Roda. By the time they were ordered to march to Rosetta the French had given up Alexandria so the Troop never had the glory of facing Napoleon's Army in the field.
On leaving Egypt the Troop returned to India where they were garrisoned at Dum Dum, Calcutta.
In 1926 the honour title Sphinx was awarded to the Battery for services in the 1801 campaign against the French in Egypt.
Anglo-Afghan Wars.
In 1842 the Troop, then known as 1st Troop, 1st Brigade Bengal Horse Artillery was involved in the famous retreat from Kabul during the First Afghan Campaign. The Troop was part of a force of 4,500 men and 12,000 civilians who left Kabul in January 1842 and were massacred by Afghan tribesmen.
“Owing to the starved condition of the horses, which rendered them unable to drag the guns of the Battery through the deep snow and rugged mountain passes, the guns were, one after the other, spiked and abandoned. The Captain, two officers and 102 NCOs and men were killed in the retreat.”
The Troop was reformed in Dum Dum and saw action in Afghanistan again in the Second Anglo-Afghan War from 1878–80, then renamed A Bty, B Brigade RHA.
On 19 April 1880 the Battery was part of a force marching from Kandahar to Ghazni to open up the route to Kabul. They met the enemy at the village of Ahmed Khel where the Battery fought a magnificent action repelling the enemy charge and allowing the main force time to deploy. In describing the action Major May said that “no Artillery has ever been called upon to repel a more determined charge, one which no Europeans would have ventured to make at all.”
The following day, at the fort of Ghunzi, two of the original guns lost in 1842 were recovered by the Battery. One is currently still in India while the other, the Ahmed Khel gun, is owned by the current Battery.
India.
The Battery was based at Dum Dum, near Calcutta, for most of the 19th century where it was involved in numerous conflicts and uprisings including the Mahratta War, the Gurkha War and the Burma War. 
The most renowned campaign the Battery fought during its time in India was during the Indian Mutiny in 1857 where it was involved in the Relief of Lucknow. 
The Residency at Lucknow had been besieged by Indian Troops for nearly six months before a British relief force, including the Battery, arrived. During the fighting Gunner and Rough Rider Edward Jennings received the Victoria Cross for his actions. Jennings was decorated for conspicuous gallantry for and action that involved the rescue of a British Officer from the hands of the mutineers.
Jennings' VC is now owned by the Battery and his exploits are remembered by the crimson stripes of the VC ribbon that now adorn the Battery stable belt.
World Wars.
Now named F Battery RHA, the Battery was heavily involved in the fighting on the Western Front during World War I seeing action in Ypres, Loos, the Somme, Arras and Cambrai amongst others as well as in Italy.
Between the wars, the Battery spent several years based at St John’s Wood performing ceremonial duties.
At the outbreak of World War II, the Battery moved to Cairo where it became part of 4th RHA. The Battery was part of Montgomery’s famous 7th Armoured Division (The Desert Rats).
7 Para RHA.
In 1961 the Battery became part of 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and moved from Germany to Aldershot as F (Sphinx) Parachute Battery RHA. It’s first operational tour in this role was in Aden where it was involved in fierce fighting in the Radfan mountains.
The Battery was then despatched for four Operation Banner tours in Northern Ireland, the final of these being a full Battery deployment to South Armagh as part of 1 Royal Scots BG. In 1994 the Battery deployed to Cyprus as part of UNFICYP and were responsible for Sector Two of the buffer zone where they patrolled the contested line and provided the Force and Sector reserve.
1996 saw the Battery deployed to Bosnia as part of the NATO led Implementation Force (IFOR). The Bty was split into 2 independent troops of 3 guns alternating deployments as well as deploying all six guns together when there was a requirement to 'show presence'.
Recent history.
In 1999 the Battery along with the rest of the Regiment became part of the newly formed 16 Air Assault Brigade.
In 2003 the Battery accompanied the Regiment to Iraq where the Regiment fired all 18 guns in the first shots fired by any coalition troops in the ground campaign. The battery then moved into Iraq to secure the Rumaylah oilfields where they were involved in a substantial counter-battery battle with Iraqi artillery units. BK Capt Grant Ingleton was awarded the MC for his actions on the gun position during the counter-battery duel. The Bty then re-rolled into the infantry role to conduct peace support operations in Maysan Province.
2006 saw members of the Battery deploy one the first of 3 tours to Helmand province, Afghanistan. On June 11, 2006 Captain Jim Philippson RHA became the first British soldier to be killed in Helmand as a result of enemy action. Later in the tour Lance Bombardier (LBdr) Ben Parkinson was seriously injured when the vehicle he was travelling in hit a landmine. LBdr Parkinson has since received considerable press attention as one of the most seriously injured soldiers to survive the conflict.
Their most recent deployment saw the Battery's gun group deployed to Artillery Hill where they carried out mentoring and training with the Afghan National Army using Russian D30 guns. They returned to Colchester in April 2011.
The Battery is currently equipped with the 105mm Light Gun. Its guns and Fire Support Teams (FSTs) provide joint fires support to 16 Air Assault brigade. The Battery is due to deploy to Afghanistan again in 2013.
In September 2013, it was part of Exercise Sphinx Resolve.

Jeff Ragsdale

Jeffrey Charles "Jeff" Ragsdale is an American author, documentary filmmaker, actor, stand-up comedian, and national game show champion. He is best known for the 2014 award-winning documentary, "Hotline", and his 2012 book "Jeff, One Lonely Guy", which was selected by Dave Eggers for inclusion in "The Best American Nonrequired Reading" 2012, and it was a GQ 2012 "Book of the Year".
Early life.
Ragsdale was born in Bellingham, Washington. He is the second of two children born to a Roman Catholic mother, Dolores, and an atheist father, Milton. His father was of Czechoslovakian (paternal) and German (maternal) descent, while his mother was of Irish and German descent. His parents operated a successful real estate developing business in Whatcom County. As a child he won the Presidential Physical Fitness Award, signed by Ronald Reagan. Ragsdale attended Sehome High School and starred on the school's basketball team. During high school he lived with the actor Jim Caviezel and family for a period. Ragsdale was friends with the actress Hilary Swank at Sehome High School. In 2000 Ragsdale received a Bachelor's degree in English from the University of Washington. He studied in the Columbia University MFA Writing Program in 2000. In 2001 and 2002 Ragsdale lived in Guadalajara, Mexico City, and San José del Cabo. In 2009 Ragsdale competed on Whoopi Goldberg's Head Games, winning the competition.
Ragsdale is an activist, participating in and organizing several protests and demonstrations for causes, one of which was prompted by the murder of Imette St. Guillen. The resulting protest, organized by Ragsdale, helped contribute to the closing of The Falls bar in New York City.
Career.
Critical reception for Ragsdale's book, "Jeff, One Lonely Guy", has been very positive, with Bret Easton Ellis praising "Jeff, One Lonely Guy": "The symphony of voices here is an overwhelming reading experience. This short book is also a verification of a legitimate new form of narrative; it’s the definitive document so far of where our medium is heading. I've never read anything like it." Ellis writes on Twitter: "The most powerful reading experience I've had in the last year is "Jeff, One Lonely Guy" by Jeff Ragsdale". He continues, "What I mean about a new art form: "Jeff, One Lonely Guy" by Jeff Ragsdale is really the first example of successful post-Empire reportage yet." Dave Eggers writes, "I love this—a great idea, and so deftly put together. A telling mosaic of modern loneliness and almost-connectedness." Poet and critic Nick Flynn asserts: "We have crossed over the threshold Ragsdale's new collage form, and are now—strangely, terrifyingly, beautifully—in this transformed world.” Literary critic, JW McCormack, writing for Bookforum, describes it as "revolutionary".
Ragsdale's work has been featured in "The New Yorker", "The New York Times", "New York Post", "CBS News", "O, The Oprah Magazine", "Huffington Post", "BBC News", "Glamour Magazine", "The Examiner", "New York Observer", "Seattle Post-Intelligencer", "Daily Mail (UK)", "Capital New York", "The Rumpus", "The Millions",
among others. "The New York Times" asserts that Ragsdale's "work sometimes involves blurring lines between reality and performance".
In 2013 Ragsdale shot a pilot for the reality show, "Being Noticed", which was produced by David Hurwitz (producer of Fear Factor and Million Second Quiz).
Ragsdale stars in the 2014 documentary feature film, "Hotline", directed by acclaimed MTV producer, Tony Shaff. Shaff and his film crew followed Ragsdale around New York City for weeks as Ragsdale worked his "Lonely Guy" hotline. "Hotline" premiered in Toronto at Hot Docs in April 2014, where it was an official selection and audience and jury favorite. 
On May 9, 2014 the Brooklyn Film Festival announced that "Hotline" had been selected for inclusion in its prestigious feature film line-up.
In 2014 critically acclaimed writer and journalist Amitava Kumar included portions of Ragsdale's book, "Jeff, One Lonely Guy", in his newly released book, "A Matter of Rats: A Short Biography of Patna". Kumar previously interviewed Ragsdale and wrote about him in "The New York Times".
In 2011 Ragsdale published the book-length essay "Rage", which was run in "The Seattle Review", and in 2012, he became a contributor to the online culture magazine "The Nervous Breakdown".
In October 2011 Ragsdale posted a flyer in New York City as a social experiment. The flyer stated that he wanted to talk to people about anything. Pictures of the flyer went viral after they were posted to the Internet, which resulted in Ragsdale receiving thousands of phone calls, texts, and voicemails from people from all over the world. This prompted him to collect several of the messages and conversations in a Postsecret-esque book, which he entitled "Jeff, One Lonely Guy". Ragsdale compiled the messages into several themes, releasing the book on March 20, 2012. The book was well received by many news outlets and authors and was a GQ's 2012 "Book of the Year".
In 2013 New Museum in New York City launched a street exhibit inspired by Ragsdale's flyer. New Museum posted 5000 flyers around the city instructing people to call a phone number to connect.
Ragsdale recorded an episode (#54) of [http://otherpeoplepod.com/archives/642] "Other People" with Brad Listi podcast on March 21, 2012, in which he discusses his early life in more detail.
Ragsdale appeared in a supporting role in the feature film "Sister Italy" in 2012.

Fortezza Medicea (Siena)

Siena’s Fortezza Medicea (the Medici Fortress sometimes called the Fort of Saint Barbara) is a fort built in the city between 1561 and 1563 on the orders of Duke Cosimo, a few years before he became the first Grand Duke of Tuscany.
The fortress is positioned on the northern edge of the central Siena in the San Prospero quarter, and since 1923 has overlooked the city’s Artemio Franchi /Montepaschi Arena.
History.
Construction of the fortress followed the Battle of Marciano which in 1554 marked the final defeat of Siena by its long standing rival, Florence. It was located on the site of a previous fort, known as the Cittadella/Citadel, which had been built in 1548 on the orders of the Emperor Charles V after the city came under the control of Spain, subjected to the authority of the Spanish ambassador, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza.
On 26 July 1552 the Sienese rose up against the Spanish, expelling them from the city and destroying the Citadel/Cittadella.
Slightly less than three years later, on 21 April 1555, after more than a year under siege by Spanish and Tuscan troops, the city surrendered. The Republic of Siena, supported by its French allies, continued to defy the Spanish from Montalcino, but the city of Siena itself was now back under Spanish control. Four years later, in April 1559, the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis was signed between France and Spain. This left the Republic of Siena without allies and led to total surrender. The city fell under the control of Spain’s regional ally, the Florentine Duke Cosimo.
In order to prevent any attempt by the Sienese to recover their independence, Cosimo ordered the construction of the present fortress on the site of the earlier Spanish Citadel. The project was entrusted to Cosimo’s celebrated Urbino born architect, Baldassarre Lanci who had started his career as a military engineer. Construction commenced in 1561 and was completed just two years later in 1563.
The fortress was demilitarized only at the end of the eighteenth century, at which point it became part of the city’s public life. In 1937, following a major restoration, the fortress was transformed into its present condition as a public park. It houses an Enoteca (a commercial center focused on the local wine industry) and frequently hosts art exhibitions. It is also used for festivals and concerts and is home to the Siena Jazz foundation.
Structure.
Originally built on an “L” shaped footprint, the fortress was subsequently transformed into its current rectangular form. On each of the four corners is an imposing brick built rampart, and on three of these the Medici coat of arms stands above the head of a lion. On the fourth, south facing corner, however, there is only the head of a lion.
The fortress is a substantial structure, with internal dimensions of approximately 180 by 125 meters and external dimensions of about 270 by 200 meters. If the outer wall is included, the structure has an external perimeter of approximately 1,500 meters.
The entrance is on the north-east side, facing Florence, and now close to the Giardini della Lizza / Lizza Gardens. On the inside the hugely wide walls are topped with broad paths, lined with trees and benches. Within the walls a permanent theatre shaped structure has now been created in order to support the public role of the fortress.
On the outside, the fortress is positioned between the city’s stadium and the Lizza Gardens. On the south-east side, which faces the city, a statue of the city’s saint, Catherine of Siena, has recently been erected.

Roma quanta fuit ipsa ruina docet

Roma quanta fuit ipsa ruina docet is a Latin phrase which roughly translates to, "How great Rome was, its very ruins tell."
Origin.
The first known appearance of the maxim is in Francesco Albertini's "Opusculum". 
Dutch painter Maarten van Heemskerck wrote the phrase on his drawing of the Septizonium. Architect and author Peter Murray theorized that Heemskerck's use of the phrase might have been the first, writing, "It is ironical that his drawings of the Septizonium are not only the most important documents for its appearance, but it was one of these very drawings that he chose to bear the mysterious epigram — perhaps invented by him — "Roma quanta fuit ipsa ruina docet"."

Episode 4 (Twin Peaks)

"Episode 4", also known as "The One-Armed Man", is the fifth episode of the first season of the American mystery television series "Twin Peaks". The episode was written by Robert Engels, and directed by Tim Hunter. "Episode 4" features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan, Piper Laurie and Richard Beymer, and introduces series co-creator David Lynch in the role of Gordon Cole.
Hunter's directing of the episode was inspired by Otto Preminger's 1945 film "Fallen Angel", making use of small sets and long depth of field shots. Engels has identified several 1960s television series—"The Wild Wild West", "Mayberry R.F.D." and "The Fugitive"—as being influential to the series as a whole.
First airing on May 3, 1990, "Episode 4" was viewed by approximately 19 percent of the available audience during its broadcast, marking an increase in viewers from the previous week. "Episode 4" has received positive reviews from critics.
Plot.
Background.
The small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has come to the town to investigate, and initial suspicion has fallen upon Palmer's boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and the man with whom she was cheating on Briggs, James Hurley (James Marshall). However, other inhabitants of the town have their own suspicions, including the violent, drug-dealing truck driver Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re). Cooper experiences a surreal dream in which a dwarf and a woman resembling Laura reveal the identity of the killer. Laura's cousin Madeline Ferguson (Lee) arrives in town, while Cooper is introduced to the Bookhouse Boys, the town's secret society.
Events.
Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie) describes her vision of Killer Bob (Frank Silva) to Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz), while he sketches the man's face. She also describes a vision of someone taking Laura's heart necklace; Donna Heyward (Lara Flynn Boyle) winces at this, as she is the one who has it.
Cooper interviews Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), a psychiatrist who had been seeing Laura. Jacoby does not wish to breach his confidentiality agreement, but admits that he struggled to understand Laura's problems. He also casts suspicion on a man driving a red Corvette—Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re).
Gordon Cole (David Lynch) calls Cooper at the sheriff's station, offering insight into Laura's autopsy. Brennan brings in his sketch, which Cooper identifies as the man from his dream. He also receives a call from Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse), who has located the one-armed man they believe is somehow involved; the group find him at a motel. The man, Philip Michael Gerard (Al Strobel) is a traveling salesman, who denies any involvement or that he knows BOB.
At the same motel, local businessman Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer) meets with Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie); the two are having an affair and planning to burn down the town's sawmill. The mill is owned by Josie Packard (Joan Chen), the widow of Martell's brother; Packard is spying on the couple in their motel room. Later, Horne meets with Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re), a violent truck driver, to arrange having the mill destroyed.
Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) travels to a parole hearing for her husband, Hank (Chris Mulkey). She is uneasy about helping his case as she is seeing Ed Hurley (Everett McGill), but promises him a job at the diner she owns. Meanwhile, Johnson's wife Shelley is having an affair with Briggs; she shows him Johnson's bloodstained shirt. He takes it, promising to rid them of Johnson for good.
Cooper, Truman and Brennan visit a veterinarian connected to Gerard; they find twine there of the type used to bind Laura. They believe that the bird that clawed her body is one of the animals being treated there, and confiscate the practice's files in order to locate the owners of birds being treated there. They learn that the scratches have been caused by a myna, and that drug smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) owns one. They raid Renault's home, interrupting Briggs, who is planting Johnson's bloodied shirt. He flees, undetected; however, the bird and shirt are recovered as evidence.
At the RR Diner, Hurley meets Madeline Ferguson (Lee), Laura's identical cousin; the two seem instantly smitten. Norma finds out that Hank has been released from prison; that evening Packard receives a brief phone call from him that leaves her shaken.
Production.
"Episode 4" was the first of the series to be written by Robert Engels; Engels returned to pen a number of other episodes across both seasons. The episode was directed by Tim Hunter, who would also go on to helm "Episode 16" and "Episode 28" in the second season. Hunter had known series co-creator David Lynch from their time studying together at the American Film Institute. Engels had been brought on board by the other creative force in the series, Mark Frost, who felt that Engels' sense of humor would be well-suited to the series' style. Engels found the pace of the series' writing to be quite fast, noting that Frost and Lynch would outline the plot of an episode in a matter of hours—Engels had previously been used to spending days at a time working on similar amounts of material with writing crews on other programs.
Hunter recalls being pleasantly surprised to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines in a loud voice, and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing.
Engels felt that the three largest influences on the series as a whole were the 1960s television series "The Wild Wild West", "Mayberry R.F.D." and "The Fugitive"—the inclusion of a one-armed character in "Twin Peaks" was a direct homage to the latter of these. Engels has also noted that the series would make use of normal, conventional storylines and everyday occurrences as a "familiar" framework, allowing subtle details to seem slightly more unusual against this backdrop—he particularly cites this episode's parole hearing for Hank Jennings as an example, as it offers nothing out of the ordinary other than the single domino which Jennings is playing with at all times, drawing attention to the item as it is the only thing which seems out of place.
Hunter's direction in some scenes was inspired by Otto Preminger's work on the 1945 film noir "Fallen Angel". That film featured several scenes shot in tight spaces with a very small mise en scène; Hunter found himself using several of Preminger's techniques to make the most out of several of the episode's smaller sets such as the RR Diner. Several scenes in the episode were also shot using a split diopter lens, allowing for a greater depth of field. For example, a scene featuring Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Beymer talking had the actors at either side of a room; the split diopter lens allowed for both of them to still be in sharp focus. The episode ends with a shot featuring a Dutch angle; Hunter was the only director on the series who Frost and Lynch allowed to use this shot, which was otherwise forbidden.
Broadcast and reception.
"Episode 4" was first broadcast on the ABC Network on May 3, 1990. In its initial airing, it was viewed by of US households, representing of the available audience. This marked a slight increase from the previous episode, which had attracted of the population and of the available audience. "Episode 4" was the forty-fourth most watched broadcast on American television that week.
"The A.V. Club" Keith Phipps rated the episode a B, deeming it "a 'normal' episode for the series". Phipps praised Al Strobel's performance, and felt that the episode served to highlight "Cooper's investigation-by-coincidence technique", while describing the character of Madeline Ferguson as "an embodiment of this series' obsession with duality". Writing for Allrovi, Andrea LeVasseur rated the episode four stars out of five. Television Without Pity's Daniel J. Blau offered mixed reactions to the episode's acting; he found Sheryl Lee, James Marshall and Grace Zabriskie to have been poor, but praised Kyle MacLachlan, Ray Wise and Dana Ashbrook for their performances.

Chris Lighty

Darrell Steven Lighty (May 8, 1968 – August 30, 2012) was an American music industry executive. He co-founded Violator, a record label, management, and marketing company, which represented hip hop artists such as Nas, Ja Rule, Mobb Deep, Missy Elliott, L.L. Cool J, Uncle Murda, and 50 Cent. He served as Sean "Diddy" Combs' manager. The "New York Times" called him "one of the most powerful figures in the hip-hop business."
Early life.
Lighty was born in the Bronx, New York and raised in the Bronx River Housing Projects. His mother was single. He had five siblings. He did not attend college, and stated that he got his "M.B.A. in hell," in reference to growing up on the streets of a dangerous neighborhood.
Career.
Lighty got his start in the music industry by carrying vinyl record crates for DJ Red Alert. Then Russell Simmons' company, Rush Management, hired him. Lighty founded a management company in the early 1990s called Violator; the company is named after the gang he belonged to in the Bronx. Violator was responsible for getting L.L. Cool J a Gap commercial in 1997. He also developed endorsements for Sprite with A Tribe Called Quest, and for Mountain Dew with Busta Rhymes. 
In 2002, Lighty & a DJ from Chicago DJ SCRAP Dirty created The Violator Allstar DJs
"I started carrying crates for Red Alert," Lighty told AllHipHop.com.
"We wanted to build a situation for the DJ’s who might need more muscle.
It’s an honor to give back to the DJ’s, create an outlet for everyone and show
how important these guys are."
DJ Scrap Dirty, who also founded the DJ coalition The Tech.Nitions, said that
the mixshow DJ community was suffering from infighting, something Violator All-Star
DJ’s hope to end. 
In 2004, Lighty brokered the largest brand endorsement deal in hip hop to date. He was the architect of what turned out to be one of the most lucrative deals in hip hop history: 50 Cent’s Vitamin Water pact. When Coca-Cola paid $4.1 billion for the company three years later, 50 Cent walked away with $100 million, and Lighty received an undisclosed sum. He was very close friends with 50 cent and help 50s career.
In 2011, Lighty launched the website ""pleaselistentomydemo.com"", which allowed new artists to submit their music online and have top music executives listen to it for a fee of $10USD. The site is no longer active.
Lighty worked for Def Jam, Jive and Loud. He was chief executive of the Brand Asset Group. In 2011, Violator merged with another company called Primary Wave; the two companies merged to form Primary Violator.
Music Manager Leon Youngblood brokered a deal with Chris Lighty to get his son Roccstar signed to Violator in 2011, Chris signed off on the deal in May 2011.
Death.
On August 30, 2012, Lighty was found dead in his Bronx apartment from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The "New York Daily News" reported that "a gun shot was heard and Lighty was found lying face-up with a 9mm pistol next to his body". "Forbes" magazine reported that he had been involved in an argument with his ex-wife Veronica not too long before his body was discovered. 
Lighty's brother said that he doesn't believe that his death was suicide and that the family is now staging its own private independent investigation which they will go public with once solid details emerge. Rapper and close friend of Chris, 50 Cent also questioned the suicide claim and hired a team to investigate the details of the incident, at the request of Lighty's mother. Friend and rapper Papoose also questioned that Chris Lighty committed suicide in the song, "Obituary 2012".

Business career of Mitt Romney

The business career of Mitt Romney began shortly after he finished graduate school in 1975. At that time, he entered the management consulting industry, and in 1977 secured a position at Bain & Company. Later serving as its chief executive officer, he helped bring the company out of financial crisis. In 1984, he co-founded and led the spin-off Bain Capital, a private equity investment firm that became highly profitable and one of the largest such firms in the nation. The fortune he earned from his business career is estimated at $190–250 million.
Entry into management consulting at Boston Consulting Group: 1975–1977.
Romney had his pick of jobs at the nation’s biggest and most prestigious consulting firms, and at that time BCG was neither. Its idiosyncratic founder, Bruce Henderson, was regarded as outside the mainstream of corporate consulting, and BCG was routinely disparaged by faculty and students at Harvard Business School. But BCG was a pioneering upstart that fostered camaraderie among its employees, who traveled around the country to advise clients, and that is where Mitt Romney chose to start his career. His legal and business education proved useful in his job while he applied BCG principles such as the growth-share matrix, which is a simple chart to assist large corporations in deciding how to allocate cash among their business units. He was viewed as having a bright future there. Romney worked nights and weekends, and traveled frequently in the U.S. and to Europe on business.
Management consulting at Bain & Company: 1977–1984.
Geoffrey Rehnert, who also worked at Bain & Company,
Romney aspired to start a new business, and in 1983, Bill Bain offered him the chance to head a new venture that would buy into companies, have them benefit from Bain consulting techniques, and allow the venture's partners to reap higher rewards than consulting fees. He initially refrained from accepting the offer, and Bain re-arranged the terms in a complicated partnership structure so that there was no financial or professional risk to Romney. Thus, in 1984, Romney left Bain & Company to co-found the spin-off private equity investment firm, Bain Capital.
Private equity at Bain Capital: 1984–1990.
Romney initially had the titles of president and managing general partner (or managing partner). He later was referred to as managing director or CEO as well. He was also the sole shareholder of the firm. At the beginning, the firm had fewer than ten employees.
When new employees were hired, they were generally in their twenties and top-ranked graduates from Stanford University or Harvard University, both of which Romney had attended.
In the face of skepticism from potential investors, Romney and his partners spent a year raising the $37 million in funds needed to start the new operation.
Early investors also included members of elite Salvadoran families who fled the country's civil war. They and other wealthy Latin Americans invested $9 million primarily through offshore companies registered in Panama.
While Bain Capital was founded by Bain executives, the firm was not an affiliate or a division of Bain & Company but rather a completely separate company. Initially, the two firms shared the same offices – in an office tower at Copley Place in Boston – and a similar approach to improving business operations. However, the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the Bain & Company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest. Bain Capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of Bain & Company. Bain Capital's original $37 million fund was raised entirely from private individuals in mid-1984. The firm initially gave a cut of its profits to Bain & Company, but Romney later persuaded Bill Bain to give that up.
The Bain Capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital. By 1985, things were going poorly enough that Romney considered closing the operation, returning investors' money back to them, and having the partners go back to their old positions. The partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by 1986, very few had been done. At first, Bain Capital focused on venture capital opportunities. One of Bain's earliest and most notable venture investments was in Staples, Inc., the office supply retailer. In 1986, Bain provided $4.5 million to two supermarket executives, Leo Kahn and Thomas G. Stemberg, to open an office supply supermarket in Brighton, Massachusetts. The fast-growing retail chain went public in 1989; by 1996, the company had grown to over 1,100 stores, and by 2008, over 2,000 stores. Bain Capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment, and Romney sat on the Staples board of directors for over a decade. Another very successful investment occurred in 1986 when $1 million was invested in medical equipment maker Calumet Coach, which eventually returned $34 million. A few years later, Bain Capital made an investment in the technology research outfit the Gartner Group, which ended up returning a 16-fold gain.
Bain invested the $37 million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by 1989 was generating an annualized return in excess of 50 percent. By the end of the decade, Bain's second fund, raised in 1987 had deployed $106 million into 13 investments. As the firm began organizing around funds, each such fund was run by a specific general partnership – that included all Bain Capital executives as well as others – which in turn was controlled by Bain Capital Inc., the management company that Romney had full ownership control of. As CEO, Romney had the final approval say on every deal made.
In 1987, former Herman's World of Sporting Goods CEO Jack Smith made a pitch to Romney, and Bain joined several other backers to help Smith open nine sporting-goods mega stores. Kmart bought the Sports Authority chain for $75 million.
Romney discovered few investment opportunities himself (and those that he did, often failed to make money for the firm). Instead, he focused on analyzing the merits of possible deals that others brought forward and on recruiting investors to participate in them once approved. The firm initially gave a cut of its profits to Bain & Company, but Romney persuaded Bain to give that up. Within Bain Capital, Romney spread profits from deals widely within the firm to keep people motivated, often keeping less than ten percent for himself. Viewed as a fair manager, he received considerable loyalty from the firm's members.
Romney's wary instincts were still in force at times, and he was generally data-driven and averse to risk.
He wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money, but other partners prevailed and it eventually gained billions. Romney was on the board of directors of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once acquired.Beginning in 1989, the firm, which began as a venture capital source investing in start-up companies, adjusted its strategy to focus on leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments in more mature companies. Their model was to buy existing firms with money mostly borrowed against their assets, partner with existing management to apply Bain methodology to their operations (rather than the hostile takeovers practiced in other leverage buyout scenarios), and sell them off in a few years. Existing CEOs were offered large equity stakes in the process, owing to Bain Capital's belief in the emerging agency theory that CEOs should be bound to maximizing shareholder value rather than other goals. By the end of 1990, Bain had raised $175 million of capital and financed 35 companies with combined revenues of $3.5 billion.
Temporary return to Bain & Company: 1991–1992.
In 1990, Romney was asked to return to Bain & Company, which was facing financial collapse. He was announced as its new CEO in January 1991 but drew only a symbolic salary of one dollar (he remained managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). His turnaround of Bain & Company has been identified as a primary example of Romney's turnaround talents from the business world, and Romney says there was no upside for him personally: "There was no particular reason to do it other than a sense of obligation and duty to an organization that had done great things for me and which employed a thousand people."  However, once Romney took up the challenge, his stake in success became enormous, and his reputation would have been diminished if Bain & Company went bankrupt.  He proceeded to apply the "Bain way" to Bain & Company itself.
Bringing along two lieutenants from Bain Capital, Romney began a traveling campaign to rally employees at all Bain offices globally.  Romney also negotiated a complex settlement between the Bain partnership and the firm's lenders, including a $10 million reduction in the $38 million Bain owed the Bank of New England, which by that time had been seized by the FDIC and placed in Chapter 7 liquidation.  Romney was able to negotiate this reduction in the debt amount with the FDIC by warning that he would use the remaining cash that Bain & Company had on hand as bonuses for Bain executives, starting with VPs making $200,000 and up.  This was a costly deal for the FDIC, but Romney's brinksmanship worked, at no expense to taxpayers.  Romney’s plan involved "a complicated restructuring of the firm's stock-ownership plan, real-estate holdings, bank loans, and money still owed to partners".  To avoid the financial crisis that a buyout would have triggered, the group of founding partners agreed to return about $100M cash and forgive outstanding debt.
Romney also imposed a new governing structure that included Bain and the other founding partners giving up control, and increasing fiscal transparency. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company through a successful turnaround and returned the firm to profitability without further layoffs or partner defections. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.
Some of the techniques that Romney employed during this temporary mission at Bain & Company were as follows: at the outset, he demanded unanimous approval from the partners at Bain & Company for his designation as CEO, and also demanded that each partner commit to staying at least a year so as to give the turnaround a fair chance.  He limited partner meetings to Saturdays, so that all of the weekdays could be devoted to taking care of client business.  Romney reduced the company's physical space, evaluated which partners were producing and which were not, arranged bridge financing, and focused on hiring top talent from top schools, while rescinding prior offers that were not up to standard.
Although in the role for just two years before returning to Bain Capital, Romney's work had three profound impacts on the firm. First, ownership was officially shifted from the owners to the firm's 70 general partners. Second, transparency in the firm's finances increased dramatically (e.g. partners were able to know each other's salaries). Third, Bill Bain relinquished ownership in the firm that carried his name.
Within a year, Bain bounced back to profitability without major partner defections, and the groundwork was laid for a period of steady growth.
Back at Bain Capital for the rest of the 1990s.
After Romney and Bain took over Brookstone in 1991, they replaced Brookstone's CEO in 1993, shifted to more Brookstone-branded items, moved more catalog content onto the company's website in 1996, and, instead of selling gifts began offering more practical items. Brookstone survived while its competitor, Sharper Image, declared bankruptcy.
In July 1992 (while Romney was still rescuing Bain & Company), Bain Capital acquired Ampad from Mead Corporation, which had acquired the company in 1986. Mead, which was experiencing difficulties integrating Ampad's products into its existing product lines, generated a cash gain of $56 million on the sale. Under Bain's ownership, the company enjoyed a significant growth in sales from $106.7 million in 1992 to $583.9 million in 1996, when the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Under Bain's ownership, the company also made a number of acquisitions, including writing products company SCM in July 1994, brand names from the American Trading and Production Corporation in August 1995, WR Acquisition and the Williamhouse-Regency Division of Delaware, Inc. in October, 1995, Niagara Envelope Company, Inc. in 1996, and Shade/Allied, Inc. in February 1997. Ampad's revenue began to decline in 1997 and the company laid off employees and closed production facilities to maintain profitability. The Ampad transaction is one of Romney's few regrets from his Bain years.
In 1994, Bain Capital acquired Totes, a producer of umbrellas and overshoes. Three years later, Totes, under Bain’s ownership, acquired Isotoner, a producer of leather gloves. Totes Isotoner is now the largest supplier of umbrellas in the world.
Bain Capital, together with Thomas H. Lee Partners, acquired Experian, the consumer credit reporting business of TRW, in 1996 for more than $1 billion. Formerly known as TRW's Information Systems and Services unit, Experian is one of the leading providers of credit reports on consumers and businesses in the US. The company was sold to Great Universal Stores for $1.7 billion just months after being acquired.
Other notable Bain investments of the late 1990s included Sealy Corporation (the manufacturer of mattresses), Alliance Laundry Systems, Domino's Pizza, and Artisan Entertainment. The Sealy and Domino's Pizza investments have been ranked by "TheStreet.com" as two of the five Romney-era investments by Bain Capital that had the biggest impact on American consumers; the other three were Staples and Sports Authority in the 1980s, and Brookstone in 1991. In 1997, when Bain invested in Sealy, the company already had a 23% share of the $4 billion mattress market, and Bain decided to make all parts of the mattress in a constant flow instead of in batches (thereby producing only the amount ordered by consumers and consequently reducing inventory), while redesigning the core mattress; Sealy's earnings increased by half in three years. Bain bought 93% of Domino's in 1998, and installed personnel who substantially boosted profits. As for Bain's purchase of film studio Artisan Entertainment in the late 1990s, Romney refused to get personally involved with it, because of its R-rated films.
Much of the firm's profits were earned from a relatively small number of deals, with Bain Capital's overall success and failure rate being about even. One study of 68 deals that Bain Capital made up through the 1990s found that the firm lost money or broke even on 33 of them. Another study that looked at the eight-year period following 77 deals during the same time found that in 17 cases the company went bankrupt or out of business, and in 6 cases Bain Capital lost all its investment. But 10 deals were very successful and represented 70 percent of the total profits. Bain Capital has publicly asserted that 80% of their 350 companies and 100 start-up investments grew as a result of Bain investments.
Romney took a leave of absence from Bain Capital from November 1993 to November 1994 in order to run for the U.S. Senate. During that time, Ampad workers went on strike, and asked Romney to intervene; Bain Capital lawyers asked him not to get involved, although he did meet with the workers to tell them he had no position of active authority in the matter.
Romney returned to Bain Capital the day after the 1994 election, but the loss had a lasting effect; he told his brother, "I never want to run for something again unless I can win." When his father died in 1995, Mitt donated his inheritance to BYU's George W. Romney Institute of Public Management. He also joined the board, as vice-chair, of the Points of Light Foundation, which had incorporated his father's National Volunteer Center.
In 1994, Bain invested in Steel Dynamics, based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, a prosperous steel company that has grown to the fifth largest in the U.S.A, employs about 6,100 people, and produces carbon steel products with 2010 revenues of $6.3 billion on steel shipments of 5.3 million tons. In 1993, Bain acquired the Armco Worldwide Grinding System steel plant in Kansas City, Missouri and merged it with its steel plant in Georgetown, South Carolina to form GST Steel. The Kansas City plant had a strike in 1997.
Bain's investment in Dade Behring represented a significant investment in the medical diagnostics industry. In 1994, Bain, together with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners completed a carveout acquisition of Dade International, the medical diagnostics division of Baxter International in a $440 million acquisition. Dade's private equity owners merged the company with DuPont's in vitro diagnostics business in May 1996 and subsequently with the Behring Diagnostics division of Hoechst AG in 1997. Aventis, the successor of Hoechst, acquired 52% of the combined company. In 1999, the company reported $1.3 billion of revenue and completed a $1.25 billion leveraged recapitalization that resulted in a payout to shareholders. The dividend, taken together with other previous shareholder dividends resulted in an eightfold return on investment to Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs.
In July 1996, when partner Bob Gray’s teenage daughter went missing in New York City, Romney shut down the Boston office and sent 56 employees to search for her, also setting up a toll-free tip line, and hiring private investigators. The search took Romney into contact with runaways on the seediest streets of New York, and a traced telephone call helped to locate the daughter, who had travelled to New Jersey for a concert without telling her parents. 
In 1998, an affiliate of Bain Capital called Brookside Capital Partners Fund bought about 6 percent of Global Tech, a Chinese appliance-maker.  Romney was the sole shareholder, sole director, President and Chief Executive Officer of Brookside.   The Obama campaign asserts that Romney profited from and indirectly supported "sweatshop conditions" at Global Tech, although independent fact-checkers say there is no evidence Romney actively sent any American jobs to China or approved the specific investment in Global Tech.
By the end of the decade, Bain Capital was on its way to being one of the top private equity firms in the nation, having increased its number of partners from 5 to 18, having 115 employees overall, and having $4 billion under its management. The firm's average annual return on investments was 113 percent. It had made between 100 and 150 deals where it acquired and then sold a company. Bain Capital's approach of applying consulting expertise to the companies it invested in became widely copied within the private equity industry.
Economist Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago would later say, "came up with a model that was very successful and very innovative and that now everybody uses." Kaplan argues that, "Bain Capital and Romney delivered spectacularly well for their customers, better than other [private equity firms that on average outperformed the public markets. Today, those customers include the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas."
In contrast to economist Kaplan, the author and polemecist Matt Taibbi of "Rolling Stone Magazine" paints a less favorable portrait of Romney's business career (Taibbi also disparages Romney as “self-righteously anal, thin-lipped, Whitest Kids U Know”). According to Taibbi, toward the middle of his career at Bain Capital, Romney moved away from helping startups, and moved toward leveraged buyouts which involved borrowing money to take over established companies in order to extract as much value as possible from those targeted companies. Taibbi calls this “financial piracy”, while acknowledging that Romney’s leveraged buyouts were not hostile takeovers, and also conceding that some of Bain’s work was not "evil" (such as Bain's successful turnaround of Experian). Taibbi blames the U.S. tax code for making leveraged buyouts possible by allowing companies like Bain to deduct interest on debt they use to acquire targets, and also by allowing individuals like Romney to pay much less than the ordinary tax rate on income. However, the "Wall Street Journal" reports that Romney likely did not participate in the latter tax rate reductions.
Romney primarily made his fortune at Bain Capital from 1984 to 1999, a fortune estimated to be worth between $190 million to $250 million.
Departure from business career: 1999–2002.
As the decade neared a close, the goal of simply making more money was losing its appeal for Romney. He took a paid leave of absence from Bain Capital in February 1999 when he became the head of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics. The decision caused turmoil at Bain Capital, with a power struggle ensuing. Some partners left and founded the Audax Group and Golden Gate Capital. Other partners threatened to leave, and there was a prospect of eight-figure lawsuits being filed. Romney was worried that the firm might be destroyed, but the crisis ebbed.
Billed in some public statements as keeping a part-time role, Romney remained the firm's sole shareholder, managing director, CEO and president, signing corporate and legal documents, attending to his interests within the firm, and conducting prolonged negotiations for the terms of his departure.
Romney was not involved in day-to-day operations of the firm after starting the Olympics position. Those were handled by a management committee, consisting of five of the fourteen remaining active partners with the firm. However, according to some interviews and press releases during 1999, Romney said he was keeping a part-time function at Bain.
During his leave of absence, Romney continued to be listed in filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as "sole shareholder, sole director, Chief Executive Officer and President". The SEC filings reflected the legal reality and the ownership interest in the Bain Capital management company. In practice, former Bain partners have stated that Romney's attention was mostly occupied by his Olympics position. He did stay in regular contact with his partners, and traveled to meet with them several times, signing corporate and legal documents and paying attention to his own interests within the firm and to his departure negotiations. Bain Capital Fund VI in 1998 was the last one Romney was involved in; investors were worried that with Romney gone, the firm would have trouble raising money for Bain Capital Fund VII in 2000, but in practice the $2.5 billion was raised without much trouble. His former partners have said that Romney had no role in assessing other new investments after February 1999, nor was he involved in directing the company’s investment funds. Discussions over the final terms of Romney's departure dragged on during this time, with Romney negotiating for the best deal he could get and his continuing position as CEO and sole shareholder giving him the leverage to do so.
Although he had left open the possibility of returning to Bain after the Olympics, Romney made his crossover to politics permanent with an announcement in August 2001. His separation from the firm was finalized in early 2002. Romney negotiated a ten-year retirement agreement with Bain Capital that allowed him to receive a passive profit share and interest as a retired partner in some Bain Capital entities, including buyout and Bain Capital investment funds, in exchange for his ownership in the management company. Because the private equity business continued to thrive, this deal would bring him millions of dollars in annual income. Romney was the first and last CEO of Bain Capital; since his departure became final, it has continued to be run by management committee.
Romney's business career has drawn both praise and criticism from his political opponents. Summarizing his business career and the creative destruction of the private equity industry, he has said: "Sometimes the medicine is a little bitter but it is necessary to save the life of the patient. My job was to try and make the enterprise successful, and in my view the best security a family can have is that the business they work for is strong." Romney's web site defends his business career.
Personal wealth generated by business career.
As a result of his career in business, Romney and his wife amassed a net worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars; their wealth remained in the range of a fifth to a quarter billion dollars as of 2011.  Most of it has been held in blind trusts since 2003.  An additional blind trust, valued at $100 million in 2012, exists in the name of the Romneys' children. The trust, created in 1995, allows the Romneys to transfer money to heirs outside their estate, taking advantage of sophisticated tax planning techniques used by high-net-worth families in an effort to defer or reduce their tax burden. Romney has an SEP-IRA worth between $21 million and $102 million. A portion of Romney's financial assets are held in offshore accounts and investments.
In 2010, Romney and his wife received $21.7 million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest. For 2010, the Romneys paid about $3 million in federal income taxes, for an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent.  For the years 1990–2009, his effective rates were at least 13.7 percent with an average effective rate of 20.2 percent.
Romney has regularly tithed to the LDS Church, including stock from Bain Capital holdings. In 2010, he and his wife gave $3 million to charity, including $1.5 million to the church.  The Romney family's Tyler Charitable Foundation gave out about $650,000 in that year, some of which went to organizations that fight diseases such as cystic fibrosis and multiple sclerosis. In addition, the Romneys have often donated  to LDS Church-owned BYU.  For the years 1990–2009, the Romneys' total charitable donations as portions of their income averaged 13.5 percent.

Bangladesh Green Building Council

Bangladesh Green Building Council (BGBC) earlier known as Sustainable Built Environment Initiative of Bangladesh is an organization in Bangladesh that serves as the Green Building Council of Bangladesh. Its main objective is to promote principles of Green Buildings and sustainable architecture in Bangladesh, especially in Dhaka, its capital which is predicted to becoming the second most largest city in the world by 2015 according to UNEP as well as one of the most polluted and unhealthy cities on earth.
History.
Initially founded as Sustainable Built Environment Initiative of Bangladesh in 2008 by environmental entrepreneur Sanwar Azam Sunny, BGBC's mission was to unify the stake holders towards a greener country, as with a growing population in a diminishing land and rapid urbanization to major cities, ‘Going green’ had become a marketing ploy for various organizations without any quantifiable way to judge a structures sustainability. The council earlier offered a centralized board to offer Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications to interested projects and firms. but later proposed a similar voluntary building rating tool that is much cheaper to attain and one that is much suited to the socio-economic conditions of the country and relevant to its building environment and construction culture.
Background.
Citing that in cramped environment, such buildings and structures would be far more comfortable and satisfying but most importantly directly address some national issues, like conserving water and energy. The Government of Bangladesh in 2009 stopped giving connections to newly constructed buildings meaning that new homes would not have access to energy, and even water due to shortages. Experts agreed that a rating tool would not only facilitate government incentives to sustainable communities but achieve the six point goals of the by the World Bank as well as the Renewable Energy Policy of 2008 by the Ministry of Power and Energy.
Climate change mitigation and adaptation.
There was a national need for sustainable development in the nation’s growing building industry and brought a forum together to act as the national GBC of Bangladesh. With needed reductions of carbon emissions from buildings. National and international energy companies like Energpac and Siemens attended the event to assess the roles of the corporate stakeholders while United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fellows commented on the global imperative of such an initiative. The first proposed rating tool aimed to fulfill the from the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as for the first time the council provided support for green building certifications.
Rating Systems: Tools and Indexes.
Such green building standards and tools will lead to conservation as buildings would less consumption of electricity and water, and also 'the need for reduction of carbon emissions' in the current building and construction scenario. At the same meeting, the Additional Chief Architect of the Ministry of Housing and Public Works, Bangladesh spoke about the government’s role. By 2012, the Ministry of Public Works began working with the World Bank to study energy and water efficiency and emissions reductions through Green Building Codes.
Activities.
Professional Development.
Initially with minimal government support, the plan was to transform the market with cost effective steps. According to an article in the "The Independent" BGBC executives and experts claimed there is a great misconception regarding the cost effectiveness of the green design and construction, and that increased productivity and energy savings of a green building outweighs initial costs. About the feasibility of widespread utilization of LEED certifications, they said that it is very expensive and the Bangladesh is in the process of developing a green building rating system in the regional context. These activities were also promoted by national and region experts. Prominent national award winning architects such as Mustapha Khalid Palash, the 2010 Holcim Green Built Sustainable Design Competition winner was the Chairman of the Practicing Professionals Committee, and Rafiq Azam, defined BGBC platform as a way for Bangladesh to define ‘Green’ according to the national circumstances. The Institute of Architects Bangladesh, which works with different government organization to offer education and government advocacy commented on the adaptability of sustainable principles in the national architecture community in the form of the BGBC rating tool.
