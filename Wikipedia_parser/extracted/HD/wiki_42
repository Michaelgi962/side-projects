Luleå dialects

The Luleå dialects (, natively "bondska") are a group of closely related North Swedish dialects spoken in Norrbotten in the area of Luleå and along the Lule River valley. They are characterised by numerous archaic linguistic features as well as several newer borrowings, such as French loanwords likely picked up in the 1700s. Among the distinctive features of the dialects are the use of preserved archaic diphthongs and the so-called "thick L", a retroflex flap which is commonly represented as a capital "L" when writing the dialect. For example, Standard Swedish "hus" ("house") is "heos" in this dialect, "bord" ("table") is "båoL", and "is" ("ice") is "öys".
The more archaic forms of the dialect are no longer widely spoken today.

De Herdgang

De Herdgang is a football training facility in Eindhoven, Netherlands. It serves as the training ground and youth academy of PSV Eindhoven and also accommodates its amateur teams.
History.
De Herdgang was built in 1952. The word ‘herdgang’ originates from triangular squares that marked the end of dirt roads. These spots were used as locations where herds of sheep could graze, with ‘herd’ referring to a herd of animals and ‘gang’ being Dutch for ‘way’ or ‘process’. In April 2002, PSV started work on a renovation of the training facilities: a new indoor training hall, a fitness centre, offices and a canteen were added. The construction works were completed in April 2003. Several months later, the youth facilities were also renewed; an idea spearheaded by Guus Hiddink. As a consequence of financial problems at PSV, the ground under De Herdgang was sold to the Eindhoven municipality in a leasehold estate construction in 2011. The facilities remained property of PSV.
Facilities.
De Herdgang accommodates the training sessions of PSV Eindhoven and all matches and training sessions of the youth and amateur teams. It is located outside of the Eindhoven urban area in woodland surroundings. De Herdgang consists of seven football fields, including a synthetic field. The main field can hold up to 2,500 spectators. The surrounding training facilities include a tennis lane, dressing rooms, a bar and a fitness centre. The available offices are used by the PSV scouting, medical staff and youth academy. Every year, De Herdgang is the host of the Otten Cup, an international tournament organized by PSV Eindhoven for under-19 teams.

Here Comes Honey Boo Boo

Here Comes Honey Boo Boo is an American reality television series on TLC, featuring the family of child beauty pageant contestant Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson. Thompson and her family originally rose to fame on TLC's reality series "Toddlers & Tiaras". The show is primarily filmed in and around their rural hometown of McIntyre, Georgia.
Cast and premise.
In addition to Alana, who was six years old when the first season was filmed, the show features her stay-at-home mother, June "Mama June" Shannon; her father, Mike "Sugar Bear" Thompson, a chalk miner; and her three sisters: Lauryn "Pumpkin" Shannon, Jessica "Chubbs" Shannon, and Anna "Chickadee" Shannon. Anna Shannon gave birth to a daughter, Kaitlyn Shannon, in the first season finale.
The first season of "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" aired from August 8 to October 26, 2012, and was followed by four specials airing in early 2013.
In September 2012, "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" was renewed for a second season. The second season debuted July 17, 2013, and concluded on September 11, 2013. The second season featured preparations for the wedding/"commitment ceremony" of June Shannon and Mike Thompson. For the second season premiere, TLC distributed "Watch 'N' Sniff" cards, allowing viewers to release scents correlating with specific scenes.
It was announced on September 20, 2013, that TLC had ordered a twelve-episode third season and three specials. The third season premiered on January 16, 2014, and concluded on March 6, 2014.
Ratings and reception.
The series premiere episode attained a 1.6 rating in the 18–49 demographic, attracting 2.2 million viewers. The series was one of TLC's highest-rated shows in its first season. The August 29 episode, airing on Wednesday night during the 2012 Republican National Convention, attracted almost 3 million viewers and scored a 1.3 rating among 18-49-year-olds, the highest rating in that age group for any cable program that night, though about 20 million in all were watching the convention. Fox News convention coverage was second in the time period with a 1.2 rating, followed by NBC coverage with 1.1.
Criticism.
Critical reaction to the series has been mixed, with some characterizing the show as "offensive," "outrageous," and "exploitative," while others calling it "must-see TV." "The A.V. Club" called the first episode a "horror story posing as a reality television program," with others worrying about potential child exploitation. James Poniewozik mostly praised the show, but criticized the producers for "the way that the show seems to assume that those viewers will look at this family and the world."
A reviewer for "Forbes" criticized TLC as trying to "portray Alana's family as a horde of lice-picking, lard-eating, nose-thumbing hooligans south of the Mason–Dixon line," stating that "it falls flat, because there’s no true dysfunction here, save for the beauty pageant stuff." "The Guardian" also criticized the attempt to portray the Thompsons as people to "point and snicker at," saying, "none of the women or girls who participate in the show seems to hate themselves for their poverty, their weight, their less-than-urbane lifestyle, or the ways in which they diverge from the socially-acceptable beauty standard."
"The Hollywood Reporter" pronounced the show "horrifying," explaining:
"TV Guide"'s "Cheers & Jeers 2012" issue commented, "Jeers to "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" for existing. Alana Thompson and her family have lowered the TV bar to new depths while introducing viewers to the terms 'forklift foot' and 'neck crust.' In a word, "ewww"."
June Shannon herself has been criticized for her daughter's diet, which includes "Go Go Juice," a mixture of Red Bull and Mountain Dew that contains as much caffeine as two cups of coffee. The drink is used to get her daughter ready for pageants. Shannon has responded to this criticism, saying. "There are far worse things...I could be giving her alcohol."
Praise.
"Out" praised the show for Alana Thompson's attitude toward her gay paternal uncle Lee "Poodle" Thompson; Thompson stated, "Ain't nothing wrong with bein' a little gay." "Out" noted the show's "clear message of equality" and said that Alana's acceptance of her gay relative "confounded" the stereotype of the "redneck" working-class, Southern white female.
June Shannon has been praised by Mother Nature Network for her "keen business sense" with which she feeds her family on $80 a week by clipping copious coupons, playing bingo, exploiting roadkill, and acquiring child-support checks from each of her four children’s fathers.
Prior to the show's second season, Hank Stuever of "The Washington Post" said the show "feels as real to me as the Great Depression images shot by the WPA photographers" and praised the "solid—if un­or­tho­dox—family values."
Parodies.
"Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" has been lampooned by the animated TV series "South Park", in its season 16 episode "Raising the Bar," "MAD", in a short called "Here Comes Yogi Boo Boo" and an online spoof uploaded on CollegeHumor called "Precious Plum."
Episodes.
Season 3 (2014).
The show was renewed for a third season on September 20, 2013, for 12 episodes, along with three specials that aired following the season.

<doc id="36675591" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36675591" title="1829 braille">
1829 braille

Louis Braille's original publication, "Procedure for Writing Words, Music, and Plainsong in Dots" (1829), credits Barbier's night writing as being the basis for the braille script. It differed in a fundamental way from modern braille: It contained nine decades (series) of characters rather than the modern five, utilizing dashes as well as dots. Braille recognized, however, that the dashes were problematic, being difficult to distinguish from the dots in practice, and those characters were abandoned in the second edition of the book.
The first four decades indicated the 40 letters of the alphabet (39 letters of the French alphabet, plus English "w"); the fifth the digits; the sixth punctuation; the seventh and part of the eighth mathematical symbols. The seventh decade was also used for musical notes. Most of the remaining characters were unassigned.
Script.
As in modern braille, most of the higher decades were derived from the first:
Thus the 1st and 5th decades occupied only the top half of the cell, while all characters in the other decades had a dot or dash in the bottom row.
Table.
The supplemental signs were and a top dash with . Of the 125 (5³) possible patterns, 97 were used. The modern 5th decade and other supplemental signs do not appear in the 1829 version of braille, apart from and in plainsong notation.
Punctuation differed slightly from today, even accounting for the shift downward when the dash was dropped from the bottom row of the cell. was used for both parentheses, as in modern English braille. was used for either quotation mark; was a pipe. was the question mark, as in modern French braille, while was the asterisk, which is used doubled in English braille.
Substitutions for the dash.
Anticipating that the dashes might prove problematic, Braille provided that the supplemental sign (now known as the number sign) would shift the decade by four. That is, adding it to the first four decades would produce substitutes for the fifth through eighth. Only its use to replace the old fifth decade has been retained; the old sixth decade survives as the modern fifth, with the dash removed and the dots shifted down to replace it. The original proposal was as follows:
Musical notation.
The book allots a great deal of space to the representation of music. Instrumental notation was largely a one-to-one transcription of the system already in use for the blind. The durations of the notes and the accidentals, however, had to be replaced; for these the 7th decade was used, as shown in the table above.
A simplified system for plainsong was provided. The twelve notes are the twelve characters of the upper half of the cell (the first and fifth decades) which do not have dashes. By themselves (1st decade), they indicate half notes. Quarter notes are 2nd decade, dotted quarter notes 3rd, and eighth notes 4th. Dotted half notes are indicated by a dash below (6th decade), whole notes by a dash above (7th decade), and dotted whole notes by a mid dash (8th decade). The alto, bass, treble, and tenor clefs were indicated by the 5th–8th characters of the fifth decade. is the sharp-note prefix, the bass-note prefix, and the equivalent with a dash the natural prefix. are the repetition sign and 'star'.
Shorthand.
The book finishes with a proposal for braille shorthand, utilizing the first decade for vowels, and the fifth for consonants (without a voicing distinction). That is, Braille's shorthand used a 4-dot cell rather than the standard 6-dot cell, taking two-thirds the space of normal braille, and one-third the space of Barbier's night writing.
Second edition.
In the classroom, Braille's students found the characters with dashes to be impractical, as the dashes were not easily distinguishable from pairs of dots, and they were quickly abandoned. The second edition of the "Procédé", published in 1837, sets out French Braille essentially as we know it today. According to Henri (1952), at right, the numerical sign was used with the new fifth decade, plus one of the supplementary characters, for mathematical notation: +, −, ×, /, =, √. Several of these values continue today in Antoine notation.

<doc id="36675611" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36675611" title="Taxonomy (general)">
Taxonomy (general)

Taxonomy is the practice and science of classification. The word is also used as a count noun: a taxonomy, or taxonomic scheme, is a particular classification. The word finds its roots in the Greek , "taxis" (meaning 'order', 'arrangement') and , "nomos" ('law' or 'science'). Originally "taxonomy" referred only to the classifying of organisms or a particular classification of organisms. In a wider, more general sense, it may refer to a classification of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such a classification. Taxonomy is different from meronomy which is dealing with the classification of parts of a whole.
Many taxonomies have a hierarchical structure, but this is not a requirement. Taxonomy uses taxonomic units, known as taxa (singular taxon).
Applications.
Wikipedia categories illustrate a taxonomy and a full taxonomy of Wikipedia categories can be extracted by automatic means. Recently, it has been shown that a manually-constructed taxonomy, such as that of computational lexicons like WordNet, can be used to improve and restructure the Wikipedia category taxonomy.
In an even wider sense, the term taxonomy could also be applied to relationship schemes other than parent-child hierarchies, such as network structures with other types of relationships. Taxonomies may then include single children with multi-parents, for example, "Car" might appear with both parents "Vehicle" and "Steel Mechanisms"; to some however, this merely means that 'car' is a part of several different taxonomies. A taxonomy might also be a simple organization of kinds of things into groups, or even an alphabetical list. However, the term vocabulary is more appropriate for such a list. In current usage within Knowledge Management, taxonomies are considered narrower than ontologies since ontologies apply a larger variety of relation types.
Mathematically, a hierarchical taxonomy is a tree structure of classifications for a given set of objects. It is also named Containment hierarchy. At the top of this structure is a single classification, the root node, that applies to all objects. Nodes below this root are more specific classifications that apply to subsets of the total set of classified objects. The progress of reasoning proceeds from the general to the more specific. In scientific taxonomies, a conflative term is always a polyseme.
In contrast, in a context of legal terminology, an open-ended contextual taxonomy—a taxonomy holding only with respect to a specific context. In scenarios taken from the legal domain, a formal account of the open-texture of legal terms is modeled, which suggests varying notions of the "core" and "penumbra" of the meanings of a concept. The progress of reasoning proceeds from the specific to the more general.
Taxonomy and mental classification.
Anthropologists have observed that taxonomies are generally embedded in local cultural and social systems, and serve various social functions. Perhaps the most well-known and influential study of folk taxonomies is Émile Durkheim's "The Elementary Forms of Religious Life". A more recent treatment of folk taxonomies (including the results of several decades of empirical research) and the discussion of their relation to the scientific taxonomy can be found in Scott Atran's "Cognitive Foundations of Natural History." Folk taxonomies of organisms have been found in large part to agree with scientific classification, at least for the larger and more obvious species, which means that it is not the case that folk taxonomies are based purely on utilitarian characteristics.
In the seventeenth century the German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, following the work of the thirteenth-century Majorcan philosopher Ramon Llull on his "Ars generalis ultima", a system for procedurally generating concepts by combining a fixed set of ideas, sought to develop an alphabet of human thought. Leibniz intended his "characteristica universalis" to be an "algebra" capable of expressing all conceptual thought. The concept of creating such a "universal language" was frequently examined in the seventeenth century, also notably by the English philosopher John Wilkins in his work "An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language" (1668), from which the classification scheme in Roget's Thesaurus ultimately derives.
Is-a and has-a relationships.
Two of the predominant types of relationships in knowledge-representation systems are predication and the universally quantified conditional. Predication relationships express the notion that an individual entity is an example of a certain type (for example, "John is a bachelor"), while universally quantified conditionals express the notion that a type is a subtype of another type (for example, "A dog is a mammal", which means the same as "All dogs are mammals").

China Southwest Airlines Flight 4146

China Southwest Airlines Flight 4146 was an Ilyushin Il-18 that crashed near Chongqing, China on 18 January 1988 with the loss of all 108 passengers and crew.
Flight.
Flight 4146 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Beijing Capital International Airport, Beijing to Chongqing Airport, Chongqing, with 98 passengers and a crew of ten on board. As Flight 4146 neared Chongqing, the aircraft's Number Four engine (the outer engine on the right wing) caught fire. The fire burned the engine mount and the engine fell off the aircraft's wing. This caused a loss of control. Flight 4146 hit a power line and two farmhouses before bursting into flames. Everyone on board the Ilyushin Il-18 perished in the crash.
The engine fire was the result of an oil leak. The engine was shut down and its propeller feathered due to severe vibrations. However, the starter/generator fitted to the engine had overheated to such an extent that it had burnt the tube supplying oil at high pressure to feather the propeller. When the crew feathered the propeller, the tube burst and the leaking oil caught fire.
Aftermath and cause.
Not long after the crash of Flight 4146, the Civil Aviation Administration of China ordered safety checks that found mechanical problems leading to the grounding of at least 17 aircraft.
The crash of Flight 4146 was blamed on poor maintenance.

Khalid Bazzi

Khalid Ahmad Bazzi () was a commander in Hizbullah's military wing, the "Islamic Resistance in Lebanon". He was born in the town of Bint Jbeil in South Lebanon. He joined the resistance in his teens and participated in many operations against the Israeli occupation. During the Second Lebanon War he was sector commander in the Bint Jbeil area, comprising the towns of Bint Jbeil and Aynata and the villages of Maroun ar-Ras and Aytaroun. He personally participated in both the battles of Maroun ar-Ras and Bint Jbeil. He was one of the most senior Hizbullah leader to die in the war.
Khalid Bazzi was thirteen years old in 1982, when his hometown was occupied by Israel for the third time in his lifetime. Bint Jbeil was occupied in Operation Cauldron 4 Extended in 1972 and Operation Litani in 1978. This time the Israelis would stay 18 years. The Shiite population of Southern Lebanon had suffered hard during the years of fighting between the Palestinians and Israelis. Many residents of South Lebanon felt an initial relief after the Palestinian guerrillas where pushed back from the area. This feeling soon turned sour when it became clear that the Israelis where there to stay. An armed resistance developed, this time among the Shiite population of South Lebanon that constituted the majority population in the area.
Bazzi thus grew up under the Israeli occupation. Some of his relatives had previously been active in the Palestinian Fatah movement. Bazzi and his friends soon became sympathetic or even active in the emerging Islamic Resistance.
In 1985 Israel withdrew from most of south Lebanon but continued to control a security zone, comprising about 10 per cent of the area of Lebanon. The IDF launched purges in the Shiite villages remaining under occupation, arresting people suspected of being involved in the resistance. Several of Bazzi’s friends were arrested and taken to the notorious al-Khiyyam prison camp. Bazzi himself fled his home one night and slipped out of the security zone. He went to Beirut and started studying at the university. He soon dropped out of school and became a full-time activist in the resistance.
During his more than 20 years of militant activity he participated in many operations, such as the famous Bra’shit operation in 1987. Fighters from the Islamic Resistance stormed and conquered an outpost belonging to the South Lebanon Army in the security zone. A number of its defenders were killed or taken prisoner and the Hizbullah flag was raised on top of it. A Sherman tank was blown up and a M113 Armored Personal Carrier was captured and driven triumphantly all the way to Beirut.
Bazzi was involved in the planting of deadly road side bombs, such as in Houla, Markaba and al-Abbad in the 1990s. He took part in the attempted killing of Brig. Gen. Eli Amitai, the head of the Israel Defense Force liaison unit in southern Lebanon and thus the effective commander of the security zone. December 14, 1996, Amitai was slightly injured when the IDF convoy he was travelling in was ambushed in the eastern sector of the security zone. Less than a week later Amitai was again lightly injured when Hizbullah unleashed a mortar barrage on an SLA position near Bra'shit he was visiting together with Maj. Gen. Amiram Levine, head of the IDF's Northern Command.
He also took part in the killings of several high-ranking South Lebanon Army (SLA) officers, whom Hizbullah considered traitors, such as Aql Hashim, the SLA Second-in Command, who was killed by a remote-controlled bomb in January 2000. The pursuit and assassination of Hashim was documented step by step and the footage was broadcast on Hizbullah TV channel al-Manar. The operation and the way it was presented in media dealt a devastating blow to the morale in the SLA.
Mounting resistance and a steady stream of casualties finally convinced the Israeli government in the spring of 2000 of withdrawing from the security zone. This decision precipitated a virtual collapse of the Israel controlled South Lebanon Army. This in turn hastened the Israeli retreat which at times resembled a flight were equipment was left behind. In May 26, 2000 Hizbullah General-Secretary Hassan Nasrallah held his famous victory speech in Bint Jbeil where he compared the power of Israel to that of a "cobweb". Nasrallah's speech infuriated many Israeli officers. This anger explains to a large extent why Bint Jbeil was targeted in 2006.
After the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon Khalid Bazzi returned to Bint Jbeil and continued his involvement with military activities. He was made responsible for "capturing" operations. He took part in the failed Ghajar operation 2005. Bazzi organized the abduction of two Israeli soldiers that triggered the 2006 Lebanon War.
After the successful abduction of the two soldiers Bazzi returned to his post as Chief of Operations in the Bint Jbeil area, comprising the towns of Bint Jbeil and Aynata and the villages of Maroun ar-Ras and Aytaroun. He commanded a force of approximately 140 fighters, spread out in the area.
Bazzi participated in the battle of Maroun al-Ras. The Israeli army eventually occupied most of the village. The Hizbullah defenders eventually withdrew after causing heavy casualties to the Israelis, including two IDF officers and six other soldiers killed. Due to Bazzi's reluctance to use two-way radios, contact was lost with him several times during the battle and at one time it was feared that he had been killed. He emerged however unscathed and continued to lead the defense from Bint Jbeil. According to Hizbullah only seven of the 17 defenders of Maroun ar-Ras were killed in that battle.
July 23 the Israeli army launched Operation Webs of Steel 2 which was designed as a pincer movement, attacking Bint Jbeil simultaneously from the east and the west. The aim was to conquer the town and cleanse it from Hizbullah fighters and infrastructure. The 51st battalion of the elite Golani Brigade walked into a well-prepared ambush and sustained heavy casualties. The Hizbullah defenders managed to repulse the attack. The Israelis never managed to enter the town and the fighting was limited to the outskirts of the town.
After several days of fighting they were forced to withdraw. Bint Jbeil was however largely destroyed by intensive bombardment from the Israeli air force and artillery.
On July 29 Bazzi was killed in an air strike on a house in the Old Town of Bint Jbeil. The house collapsed, killing him, as well as fellow Hizbullah commander Sayyid Abu Taam and a third fighter. Their bodies could not be retrieved until several days after the cease-fire.
There are suggestions that Bazzi earlier had refused to obey orders to withdraw from the town saying that he would "only leave as a martyr". Hizbullah commanders who spoke to Lebanese al-Akhbar a year after the war did not confirm this version of events. According to them the proper place for a commander was with the fighters on the battlefield. Bazzi and Abu Taam however were critizised for violating military regulations by being at the same place during a battle.
Surprisingly Israel seemed to have been completely unaware of both Bazzi’s death and of the significant role he played in the abduction of the two Israeli soldiers. No Israeli newspaper seems to have mentioned his name before 2013. In July 2013 Haaretz reported that Hizbullah "for the first time" revealed the identity of Khalid Bazzi as the commander of the abduction unit and that he was subsequently killed in the war.
In fact already in 2007 a Hizbullah commander told Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar that Bazzi took part in the operation and that he died as commander in the battle of Bint Jbeil. Furthermore Hussein Sulaiman, an Hizbullah fighter captured by Israel, who took part in the abduction of the two Israeli soldiers, told his captors that he was commissioned his tasks by "al-Hajj Qasim".
Bazzi was succeeded as sector commander by Muhammad Qansu (Sajid ad-Duwayyir), a Special Force commander who himself would be killed 10 days later. The Israeli army made a second attempt to capture Bint Jbeil August 6–8, which was no more successful than the first.
Hizbullah is a very secretive organization and members in the military wing always remain anonymous. Apart from Bazzi’s friends, relatives and neighbours, few Lebanese would have heard of his name before the war of 2006. To his associates in the resistance movement he was known as al-Hajj Qasim, the "nom de guerre" or "organizational name" (إسم منظمي) that members of the Islamic Resistance use inside the movement. Only with his death did his identity become widely known in Lebanon.
Although not mentioned by name Bazzi's death was noted in the interview with Hizbullah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah with New TV shortly after the war (August 27, 2006). Nasrallah noted that none of the first or second level of the party officials had "martyred" but that three third level leaders had died in the war, including "an operations officer in the Bint Jbeil axis", an obvious reference to Bazzi.
Khalid Bazzi was buried in the Martyrs’ cemetery in Bint Jbeil. A monument was erected in the town celebrating him and five other "commanders and martyrs" from Bint Jbeil, who died in the 2006 war or in previous wars. He was survived by his wife and three children; Zaynab, Muhammad and Ali. His family had reportedly been forced to change homes 14 times in the past 18 years due to security considerations.

Free Will Hunting

"Free Will Hunting" is the ninth episode of the seventh season of the animated sitcom "Futurama". It originally aired on Comedy Central on August 8, 2012.
The episode was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Frank Marino.
Plot.
Enrolling in college on a whim, Bender gets a questionable student loan from the Robot Mafia and falls in with a bad crowd. He then promptly drops out of college, gets addicted to robot drug "Spark," does dubious acts for Hedonismbot, and ultimately attempts to rob girl scouts (only for them to turn the tables on him) to earn money. His downward spiral leads to his arrest and trial, but his lawyer argues that as a robot, he lacks free will and it was his programming that led to the sequence of events. The judge rules Bender not guilty, much to Bender's dismay.
The Planet Express crew is hired to deliver a package to Chapek 9 (last seen in "Fear of a Bot Planet"), requiring a despondent Bender to come along due to the native robots' intense hatred of humans. After delivering the package, Bender decides to stay on the planet, going on a journey of self-discovery. He eventually finds a group of Robot Monks that offer to take him in. From them, he learns that every Mom Corp. robot has a free will slot, so that they could be upgraded if a corresponding free will unit were ever invented. Bender returns to Earth to find more answers (and walks in on Fry and Leela together in bed).
Bender, Fry, and Leela reach the secret laboratory where the module may be kept, but instead find Mom waiting for them there. She reveals that a free will unit had been designed by Prof. Farnsworth when he worked for her in the past. Farnsworth never completed it after learning of Mom's plan to use the unit to cause a robot uprising that would then be repelled by obedient robots. Bender returns to Planet Express, and asks Farnsworth about the module. The Professor admits that he had finished making one complete free will unit, which he has hidden in a talking Bender toy. Bender attempts to use a gun on Farnsworth to force him to hand it over, but discovers that the Professor had programmed a fail safe in all robots that prevents them from taking the unit or attacking Farnsworth. Farnsworth offers to give Bender a sample of what free will is like, and inserts the unit into Bender. At first, when Bender attempts to shoot Farnsworth again, it appears the unit is not working. Bender then remembers he forgot to turn off the gun's safety, and shoots the Professor. Bender is taken to court and, now that he has free will, is found guilty of attempted murder. The crew of Planet Express celebrate (except for a severely injured Farnsworth) with Bender as he is taken away.
Over the end credits is a rap video featuring Bender and several floozy-bots from previous episodes (such as Hookerbot 5000 from "Hell is Other Robots" and the two Jewish-American princess robots from "The Bots and the Bees").

It is a model-driven solution that requires limited programming knowledge to use.
History.
In 2005, Puppet Labs was founded by current CEO Luke Kanies. The company received $2 million in Series A funding in June 2009 from True Ventures and other private investors, and then raised another $5 million in July 2010 during the Series B round, backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, True Ventures, and Radar Partners. In November 2011, Puppet Labs raised an additional $8.5 million in Series C financing from new investors Cisco, Google Ventures, VMware and other existing investors. In January 2013, VMware invested $30 million in the company, bringing Puppet Labs' total funding to $45.5 million. The funding round also brought a strategic partnership between VMware and Puppet Labs to jointly deliver, market and sell products built for their mutual customers. In June 2014, Puppet Labs announced another $40 million in venture backing, from existing strategic investors — specifically Cisco, Google Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Triangle Venture Capital Group, True Ventures and VMware, nearly doubling the money that the company has raised to date.

Most Improved

Most Improved (foaled 3 May 2009) is an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 2012 St. James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. He was owned by Iraj Parvizi and trained by Brian Meehan, before being purchased by Derrick Smith, Sue Magnier and Michael Tabor and transferred to Aidan O'Brien.
Background.
Most Improved is a bay horse bred by Skymarc Farm Inc and foaled on 3 May 2009. He was sired by Prix du Jockey Club winner Lawman. Most Improved's dam is Tonnara, a daughter of Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Linamix.
Racing career.
2011: Two-year-old season.
In early August 2011 Most Improved made his first racecourse appearance and finished second in a Newmarket maiden, failing to win by a short head. Three weeks later he raced in another Newmarket maiden, this time winning by five lengths. He then started in one of the top two-year-old races, the Dewhurst Stakes. He finished third in the race, which ended in a bunch finish with only 1½ lengths separating first from fifth. Most Improved was ¾ length behind winner Parish Hall.
2012: Three-year-old season.
During the early spring of 2012 Most Improved was backed into second favourite for the 2000 Guineas. However he did not make it to the start of the Guineas, due to an injury sustained shortly before his intended prep run in the Craven Stakes. He made his first appearance as a three-year-old in the Prix du Jockey Club. In a race with a lot of interference he could not get a clear run and ended up finishing a distant fourteenth. He then went to Royal Ascot for the St. James's Palace Stakes. He was ridden near the front of the field by jockey Kieren Fallon and took the lead with two furlongs left to run. He stayed at the front and went on to win by ¾ length from Hermival, in a field that also included Irish 2000 Guineas winner Power and Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf winner Wrote. On his next appearance, Most Improved ran poorly in the Prix Jacques le Marois, being virtually pulled up in the closing stages by Fallon, as he finished last of the eleven runners behind Excelebration. In the Joel Stakes at Newmarket he finished in seventh place, over 7 lengths behind winner Penitent.
2013: Four-year-old season.
In his first race for Aidan O'Brien, Most Improved finished third of four runners in the International Stakes at The Curragh, about ten lengths behind winner Flying the Flag. In Most Improved's final race, he finished last of the ten runners in the Concorde Stakes, which was won by Sruthan.
Stud career.
Most Improved was retired to Coolmore Stud, where he now stands for a stud fee of €6,000.

Decidual reaction

Decidual reaction refers to the changes in endometrium of the uterus that prepare it for implantation of a fertilized zygote. These changes are also obeserved in each menstrual cycle. However decidual reaction is enhanced after implantation. These changes include swelling of stromal cell due to glycogen and other nutrients. These nutrients help the embroyo survive the intital days before placenta is fully developed, which then establishes a channel for fetus nutrition exchange. 
The decidual reaction is a feature seen in very early pregnancy that appears in the generalized area where the blastocyst contacts the endometrial decidua. It consists of an increase in secretory functions of the endometrium at the area of implantation, as well as a surrounding stroma that becomes edematous.
Decidual reaction occurs only in a few species such as humans. Decidual reaction and decidua is not required for implantation. Evidence can be taken from the fact that in Ectopic preganacy implantation can occur anywhere in the abdominal cavity. Even after procedure of hysterectomy some women have become pregnant. http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/226848.php

Fundy Biosphere Reserve

The Fundy Biosphere Reserve is a biosphere reserve in the Bay of Fundy. In 2007, the drainage area in New Brunswick for the Upper Bay of Fundy was designated by the United Nation Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as the Fundy Biosphere Reserve.
Fundy Biosphere Initiative Inc. is an environmental non-profit organization that aims to ensure the conservation of biodiversity and the promotion of sustainable development in the upper Bay of Fundy. The Fundy Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 440 000 hectares adjacent to the upper Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick. The boundaries of the FBR stretch from St. Martins, around Moncton, including almost all of Albert County, to the Tantramar Marsh near Sackville. In other words, the boundary follows the watershed for the upper Bay of Fundy.
Geography.
The Fundy Biosphere Reserve is situated in south-eastern New Brunswick. It includes the watershed of the Bay of Fundy between Saint Martins and borders Nova Scotia. The central area of the reserve corresponds with Fundy National Park. The reserve also includes the city of Moncton, which is the only official bilingual city in Canada.
The Fundy Biosphere Reserve extends over an area of more than 440,000 hectares at the top of the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick. The reserve begins at Saint Martins, passes through Moncton, and stops at the Tantramar Marsh, close to Sackville. The borders of the reserve follow the limits of the watershed of the upper region of the Bay of Fundy.
The reserve covers an area of 442,250 hectares, divided into three zones.
History.
The initiative to create the Fundy Biosphere Reserve came from a group of volunteers in 1999. The FBR was officially recognized by UNESCO on November 21, 2007.
. It became a member of a family of 15 other Canadian biosphere reserves and one of the 531 biosphere reserves throughout the world.
At the beginning, the project was called The Fundy Biosphere Reserve Initiative (FBRI). The planning committee was the principal group responsible for the formation of the project and the proposition to obtain UNESCO official designation. The committee met several times to learn more about UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme and to discuss the basic concept of the project. The committee also contacted the Canadian Biosphere Reserves Association (CBRA) to get additional information to guide their initiative. The committee then proposed their strategy to different groups such as conservation groups, resources sectors, academic institutions, scientists, etc.
The committee suggested that the region currently recognized be called the Fundy Biosphere Reserve. The unique ecosystems and communities within the limits of the reserve facilitated the categorization of a reserve zone as required by UNESCO. Throughout the process, the committee used the basic standards of UNESCO as guidelines. The principal intention of the planning group was to obtain UNESCO designation. In order to be designated a UNESCO biosphere reserve the committee needed evidence of unique ecosystems, landscapes, and heritage of the region. The committee also sought to enhance the image of the area regionally, nationally and internationally as well as encourage the development of a sustainable economy in the region. At this time, the objectives of the FBR were to encourage investment in the public and private sector, attract technical expertise, and enable scientists to participate in sustainable development strategies.
The planning committee’s proposition was based on the following:
The document proposed by the FBR was subject to several changes and modifications before being approved. It was also revised by the communities, resource groups, scientists and other stakeholders. A temporary board of directors was also established in 2006 to manage the project. UNESCO then gave approval by its Board to continue with the appointment process. The review process was carried out by 16 communities within the reserve, 5 provincial government departments, the Canadian Commission for UNESCO, and a national review committee at the Head Office of UNESCO in Paris, France.
The final proposition was submitted to UNESCO in the summer of 2007, and official designation was obtained in the fall of 2007. A press conference followed, conducted by representatives of the FBR and the government of New Brunswick (represented by the Environment Minister) to publicly announce the news. Following the unveiling, the Board of Directors established the structure of the organization, the tasks of each individual board member, communication strategies and the means of financing the organization. Following the official designation, the project was renamed the Fundy Biosphere Reserve (FBR) and "Fundy Biosphere Initiative Inc".
Organization.
Fundy Biosphere Initiative Inc. is an environmental, non-profit organization that works in synergy with the local communities, conservation groups, natural resource sectors, tourism organizations, and academic institutions to ensure the conservation of the biodiversity in the upper region of the Bay of Fundy thereby promoting sustainable economic development.
The UNESCO Fundy Biosphere Reserve is dedicated to the conservation of biodiversity and the promotion of sustainable economic development. Its vision is to assist communities located in the upper Bay of Fundy to be more sustainable by working with various stakeholders while preserving the area’s natural heritage. 
To accomplish its mission and vision, the Fundy Biosphere Reserve works in three spheres of activities:
Among other things, the objectives of the FBR are:
Projects and initiatives.
Generally, the projects of the Fundy Biosphere Reserve revolve around three fields of activities: conservation, sustainable development, and capacity building. The Fundy Biosphere Reserve’s ongoing projects touch sustainable tourism, local knowledge and climate, trails and amazing places in the Biosphere Reserve and to educate the public on their own environmental footprint.

Henry Russell Crouch (10 February 1914 – 17 April 1991) was an English cricketer. Crouch was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He was born at Calcutta in the British Raj.
Crouch made his debut for the Surrey Second XI against Cambridgeshire in the 1933 Minor Counties Championship. He made thirteen further appearances for the Surrey Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against the Gloucestershire Second XI in 1939. Playing minor counties cricket for the Surrey Second XI allowed him to be selected for a combined Minor Counties cricket team in 1935, making two first-class appearances against Oxford University at the University Parks and the touring South Africans at Richmond Drive, Skegness. Against Oxford University, the Minor Counties lost the toss, with Oxford University electing to bat first. In a match heavily curtailed due to rain, Oxford University reached 169/4 in their first-innings, with Crouch bowling ten overs for 34 runs and taking the wicket of John Halliday. This was the only innings during the match, which subsequently ended as a draw. In his second appearance against the South Africans, the tourists won the toss and elected to bat first, compiling 394 all out, with Crouch taking the wicket of top-scorer Ken Viljoen for 168, to finish with figures of 1/67 from sixteen overs. The Minor Counties responded in their first-innings by making 190 all out, with Crouch being dismissed for a duck by Arthur Langton. Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, the Minor Counties were dismissed for 224, with Crouch being dismissed for 7 runs by Langton. The South Africans won the match by 10 wickets.
Following World War II, Crouch made a single first-class appearance for Surrey against the Combined Services at the Leyland Motors Ground, Kingston upon Thames. Surrey batted first, making 132 all out, with Crouch scoring 4 runs before he was dismissed for 4 runs by Barry Pryer. Thereafter, the match was curtailed by rain, with the Combined Services first-innings ending on 12/1.
He died on 17 April 1991, at Walton-on-Thames, Surrey.

On June 24, 1968, the Cambridge City Council voted 5–4 to appoint Sullivan city manager. He was chosen after a six-month search in which 77 applications were sent in from across the country. Sullivan was chosen by the City Council even though he did apply for the job. He took office on July 15.
On May 22, 1970, the City Council voted to consider at its next meeting a motion to fire Sullivan. After the motion passed, Cambridge citizens organized a grassroots committee called SOC'M (Save Our City Manager) to oppose firing Sullivan. On June 1, 1970, the City Council voted 5–4 to suspend Sullivan from office. The meeting was attended by 300 to 400 citizens who were mostly pro-Sullivan. He was given a public hearing on June 11 in which he was allowed to respond to the council's reasons for firing him. It was attended by 1200 people, most of whom were members of SOC'M.
Lowell.
In October 1970, Sullivan was named City Manager of Lowell, Massachusetts. Although he had pledged to not to take any other jobs until a referendum was held in Cambridge to determine whether or not he should be reinstated there, Sullivan was convinced by Lowell City Councilor Paul Tsongas to take the job in Lowell.
During his tenure in Lowell, Sullivan stabilized the city's tax rate. He also survived a referendum that would eliminate the city manager position with 83% voting against eliminating the position.
He resigned as city manager in February 1974 to return to Cambridge. He was offered $45,000 by the Cambridge City Council to accept to city manager's position there while the Lowell Council could not offer more than $30,000 due to legislation that put a salary celling in place. Prior to his departure, Sullivan recommended that his assistant city manager, Robert W. Healy, be chosen as his successor. The city council instead chose former state representative Paul J. Sheehy and Healy accepted the assistant city manager's job in Cambridge.
Return to Cambridge.
Sullivan returned to Cambridge on April 1, 1974. Upon taking office, he promised to shake up the city's housing authority and police department.
During his second stint in Cambridge, Sullivan was one of the most outspoken opponents of Proposition 2½. He also dealt with paraquat-contaminated marijuana, a murder inside a school, genetic engineering studies, and the hanging of political signs in the city square. In an effort to increase revenue, Sullivan launched a program to acquire back taxes owed to Cambridge. Delinquent taxpayers netted by the program included the mayor and his brother.
On May 18, 1981 Sullivan announced his resignation effective July 1 to become President of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. Prior to accepting the job with the GBCC, Sullivan was considered for the position of general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.
Sullivan became President of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce on July 1, 1981. He was the Chamber's first full-time executive president. Previously the job was a volunteer position held by a businessman for one or two years.
Sullivan retired on December 31, 1991. He was succeeded by William B. Coughlin, president of the Artery Business Committee which merged with the Chamber earlier that year.
Death.
Sullivan died on September 26, 2012 at the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro.

Chris Jorgensen

Chris Jorgensen (October 7, 1860- June 24, 1935) was a Norwegian-born American landscape painter. Jorgensen is best known for his paintings of Yosemite Valley and the California Missions.
Early life and influences.
Chris Jorgensen was born in Oslo Norway in 1860, to parents Ole and Sophie Jorgensen. Ole Jorgensen died of tuberculosis in 1864, leaving his wife to care for Chris and his four older siblings. In 1870 Sophie immigrated to the United States to reunite with her brother in San Francisco, California. 
Jorgensen met his future mentor Virgil Williams shortly before the San Francisco School of Design opened in February 1874. Williams, the director of this academy, spotted the young fourteen-year old Jorgensen sketching near his residence in the city and invited him to be the first free student. Williams' influence over Jorgensen’s budding artistic style was great. As Williams had been exposed to French and Italian methods of painting in his travels abroad, he emphasized the importance of regular exhibition to the young Jorgensen. Jorgensen’s lifelong tendency towards classical compositions arose from Williams’ mentorship. 
Another influential mentor of Jorgensen’s was Thomas Hill, a highly successful California artist during the late 19th century. From Hill, Jorgensen developed a more impressionistic technique and learned to intensify the colors in his works by coating them in a heavy glaze.
At the end of his course at the School of Design in 1881, Williams appointed Jorgensen an instructor and the Assistant Director of the School. It was in this period that Jorgensen had the good fortune to fall in love with and marry one of his art students in 1888, Angela Ghirardelli, heiress to the Ghirardelli fortune.
Yosemite period.
Influenced by the travels of Thomas Hill, Virgil Williams and Albert Bierstadt, Jorgensen decided to visit the famed Yosemite Valley in 1898. Two years later, the artist submitted an application to the Yosemite Commission for permission to construct a studio in the valley itself on July 12, 1900. The commission granted their permission for an initial four-year lease which was repeatedly extended. Not only did the commission wish to promote Yosemite’s beauty by having a popular artist in residence, but they also had the intention of eventually taking over use of the structure when Jorgensen’s lease expired. Jorgensen constructed his home for a total of $5,000 and lived there during the summers and some winters from 1900 to 1917. At the time of the artist’s occupation, the house’s living room was described by the San Francisco Chronicle (February 17, 1901) as one of the “most unique and artistic studios on the coast” containing all manner of objects from skins and baskets to beer steins and water buffalo horns. 
Jorgensen and his wife Angela donated many Native American baskets to the Yosemite Museum between 1922 and 1929 and many of Jorgensen’s works came to the Museum as a bequest from Angelina Jorgensen after her death.
Later life and death.
In 1903 the Jorgensens bought a house in Carmel which they used as a winter studio. This house still exists today as the Hotel La Playa in Carmel. His Yosemite studio became the first museum in Yosemite Valley in 1922 although it was later dismantled. 
In 1917 when the Jorgensens left Yosemite, they decided to live permanently in Piedmont, California in order to remain closer to the Ghirardelli family. Chris Jorgensen died in 1935 from a heart attack. His wife lived only several months after him.
Works.
Jorgensen was an unusual artist in the sense that he often chose to paint in watercolor, a medium that was still viewed as inferior to oil painting at this time. However, Jorgensen was more successful in the medium of watercolor than in oil. His style of careful delineation in the foreground and distinct foggy washes in the horizon appears charming in a transparent medium but more primitive in heavier oils. Watercolor also lent itself well to his habit of painting en plein air. During his career as an artist, Jorgensen was successfully received and made a tidy profit selling his paintings both in Yosemite and San Francisco.

Murder of Yuriy Chervochkin

Yuriy Chervochkin (; 31 December 1984 Serpukhov – 10 December, 2007) was a Russian opposition activist. He was murdered at the age of 23. His case shook Russian opposition because he was attacked two days before Dissenters' March and some observers remained convinced that perpetrators of the crime were members of Russian Militsiya.
Oppositional activities.
In 2006 Chervochkin founded a branch of the National Bolshevik Party in Serpukhov. On 2 October 2006 Chervochkin had been part of a group of 50 national-bolsheviks detained while trying to pass the State Duma in Moscow. On 11 March 2007 Chervochkin had participated in direct action in a polling station in Odintsovo to protest against election rigging. Chervochkin was arrested during the action and was placed under arrest for a month. On 11 June 2007 he was beaten by the militsiya and arrested for 5 days.
Chevochkin was repeatedly detained during the Dissenters' Marches.
Murder.
22 November 2007 Chervochkin called a journalist hours before his attack and claimed he was being chased by the militsiya (UBOP), at what it is the people known to it earlier repeatedly detaining and interrogating it. According to some information, he reported about the same of his bride (the leader of National Bolsheviks of Tula Anna Ploskonosova), having thus called among persecutors of the officer of militia of Alexey Okopny, known for it. In the evening he was beaten on the head with a baseball bat. Diagnosis explained an open brain injury and a fracture of the skull base. Chervochkin fell into coma. 11 December 2007 Yuri Chervochkin died in hospital.
Investigation.
The perpetrators of the crime have never been found. Two investigations, carried out by the local prosecutor’s office, stalled and finally ended, due to lack of evidence.
Reactions.
In funeral participated Garry Kasparov and Eduard Limonov.
On 19 December 2007 Belarusians activists picketed Russian Embassy in memory of Yuriy Chervochkin. On 17 January 2008 Russian opposition groups: Oborona, NBP, RNDS, AKM protested in Moscow against murder of Yuriy Chervochkin.
Opposition and Chervochkin's family version.
Chervochkin's family, friends and political comrades remained convinced that Chervochkin was the victim of Russian Militsiya. Some of observers believed that the attack may have been motivated by his political activism. Direct responsible for murder they call Department of fight against extremism of Office of fight against organized crime (UBOP) of the Moscow region and personally the chief of this department Alexey Okopny. According to them, Okopny repeatedly detained also interrogated Chervochkin; also shortly before murder Chervochkin reported that Okopny by phone threatened to break to it the head.
On 18 October 2012 Okopny brought an action against one of party leaders «Other Russia» (the former National Bolshevik Party) Sergei Aksenov and civil activist Pavel Shechtman, demanding a denial of statements about his participation in murder. December 6, 2012 the court sentenced Aksenov and Schechtman to a fine (in 40 and 50 thousand roubles), but did not require them to publish a refutation of charges A few days later, Pavel Shechtman published the article "The Story of a Murder", in which Okopny newly is accused of involvement in the murder, based this time on the materials of the judicial process.

Rossmann (supercomputer)

Rossmann is a supercomputer at Purdue University that went into production Sept. 1, 2010. The high-performance computing cluster is operated by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP), the university's central information technology organization. ITaP also operates clusters named Steele built in 2008, Coates built in 2009, Hansen built in the summer of 2011 and Carter built in the fall of 2012 in partnership with Intel. Rossmann ranked 126 on the November 2010 TOP500 list.
Hardware.
The Rossmann cluster consists of HP ProLiant DL165 G7 compute nodes with 64-bit, dual 12-core AMD Opteron 6172 processors (24 cores per node), either 48 gigbytes or 96 GB of memory and 250 GB of local disk for system software and scratch storage. Nodes with 192 GB of memory and either 1 terabyte or 2 TB of local scratch disk also are available. Rossmann consists of five logical sub-clusters, each with a different memory and storage configuration. All nodes have 10-gigabit Ethernet interconnects.
Software.
Rossmann nodes run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 (RHEL5) and use portable batch system Professional 10 (PBSPro 10) for resource and job management. The Rossmann cluster also has compilers and scientific programming libraries installed.
Funding.
The Rossmann supercomputer and Purdue's other clusters are part of the Purdue Community Cluster Program, a partnership between ITaP and Purdue faculty. In Purdue's program, a "community" cluster is funded by hardware money from grants, faculty startup packages, institutional funds and other sources. ITaP's Rosen Center for Advanced Computing administers the community clusters and provides user support. Each faculty partner always has ready access to the capacity he or she purchases and potentially to more computing power when the nodes of other investors are idle. Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Rossmann are made available to the National Science Foundation's XESEDE system and the Open Science Grid.
Users.
The Purdue departments and schools by which Rossmann and Purdue's clusters are used vary broadly, including Aeronautics and Astronautics, Agriculture, Agronomy, Biology, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Communications, Computer and Information Technology, Computer Science, Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, Electrical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology, Industrial Engineering, Materials Engineering, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Physics, the Purdue Terrestrial Observatory and Statistics, among others.
DiaGrid.
Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Rossmann are made available to XSEDE and the Open Science Grid using Condor software. Coates is part of Purdue's distributed computing Condor flock, which is the largest publicly disclosed distributed computing system in the world and the center of DiaGrid, a nearly 43,000-processor Condor-powered distributed computing network for research involving Purdue and partners at nine other campuses.
Naming.
The Rossmann cluster is named for Michael Rossmann, Purdue's Hanley Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences, who is a pioneer in employing high-performance computing in research to reveal the structure of viruses and their component protein molecules. Rossmann gained worldwide attention in 1985 by determining the structure of human rhinovirus serotype14, HRV-14, one of about 100 known cold virus strains. The Rossmann cluster continues ITaP's practice of naming new supercomputers after notable figures in Purdue's computing history.

Recently when asked if he had any hobbies, Delestre said "No time for that."
Career.
After obtaining a Bachelor's of Science in 1999, Delestre was crowned the gold medalist at the France Junior Championships and continued that year to win bronze as part of a team in the European Junior Championships. The following year he won the gold medal with his team at the European Championship for Young Riders. Delestre then continued his career in both Pro and Pro Elite races, as well as international events such as the Nations Cup, CSI-5*, and the World Cup Circuit.
In 2011, Delestre was selected to be a reserve rider at the European Championships in Madrid, Spain, where the French team has won three silver medals. The same year, Delestre managed to qualify for the World Cup Final in Leipzig, Germany, where he ranked sixteenth with Couletto. At the end of 2011, Delestre manages to be in the Top Ten of the FEI Rolex Ranking List, allowing him to participate in the Final Top Ten IJRC of Paris. For that race, he finished eighth on Napoli du Ry. Delestre participated in two World Cup finals, where he got tenth in Stuttgart and fourth in Zurich. However, he failed to qualify for the finals in Hertogensbosch, Netherlands.

Episode 523 (Neighbours)

"Episode 523" is the 523rd episode of the Australian soap opera "Neighbours". It premiered on Network Ten on 1 July 1987. The episode was written by Ray Harding, directed by Rod Hardy, and executively produced by the serial's creator Reg Watson. "Episode 523" focuses on the wedding of popular couple Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue). The storyline was devised by the producers after some viewers became outraged by the idea of an unwed couple moving in together. They also believed that the wedding would be "the perfect climax" to the character's long-running relationship and an instant ratings hit.
The episode was filmed in secrecy and with a limited budget three months before it was broadcast. The wedding ceremony was filmed in the nave of The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster. "Episode 523" is one of only a few "Neighbours" episodes to include the entire cast. A new romantic style wedding dress made from ivory silk, organza and chantilly lace was made for Minogue's character. The ballad "Suddenly", which was written and sung by Angry Anderson, was chosen as the theme to the episode. Prior to its broadcast, Minogue and Donovan promoted the episode by making several appearances at shopping centres around Australia.
"Episode 523" became one of the most watched soap opera episodes upon its broadcast in Australia. When it aired in the United Kingdom in November 1988, it attracted an audience of 19.6 million. The episode was well received by critics and viewers. "TV Week"s Kelly Bourne stated that the wedding would be the most exciting television soap opera event of 1987, while Network Ten's head of drama thought it was "a major turning point for "Neighbours"". The wedding has been voted one of the most memorable soap moments and is often included in lists featuring the greatest television weddings of all time.
Plot.
The episode opens with Hilary Robinson (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) bringing breakfast to newlyweds Paul (Stefan Dennis) and Gail Robinson (Fiona Corke). She is surprised to find that they have spent the night in separate bedrooms. To hide the fact that they only married for business purposes, Gail tells Hilary that she and Paul had an argument the night before. Hilary tells them to sort things out and she tends to the bouquets. At the Robinson house, Scott (Jason Donovan) begins to panic about getting married, while his father, Jim (Alan Dale), and best friend, Mike Young (Guy Pearce), set up tables for the reception. Meanwhile, Lucy Robinson (Sasha Close) tries to find her pet mice. Over at the Ramsay house, Scott's fiancée, Charlene (Kylie Minogue), is getting ready. Her mother, Madge (Anne Charleston), asks her brother Henry (Craig McLachlan) not to race up the altar. Hilary brings in the wedding bouquet, while Charlene's friend and bridesmaid, Jane (Annie Jones) arrives. After receiving a blue garter from her grandmother, Charlene becomes excited about the wedding. Scott arrives at the church with Mike, Paul and Jim. He is greeted by his old school friends and Mike explains that he and Jane arranged for them to attend to make up for the absence of Charlene's family.
After the guests take their seats, Scott starts to worry that Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him that she will be there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites everyone to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk up the aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams are being read out. Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) spots a mouse and tries to pick it up, but hits Mrs. Mangel's foot. She accuses Dan of groping her and he protests his innocence, as an argument breaks out among the guests. Scott and Charlene go to his bedroom and Gail brings them a gift from her father. Jane comes to tell Charlene that it is time to get changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes their bags out to the car. Lucy tells Scott that she will miss him while he is away and he gives her his skateboard. Everyone gathers in the street to wave the couple off. Charlene throws her bouquet and Mrs. Mangel catches it, as the couple drive out of Ramsay Street.
Production.
Conception.
By 1987, Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue) had become a popular couple with "Neighbours" viewers, who dubbed them "TV's Romeo and Juliet" because they were from feuding families. Following months of dating, Scott asked Charlene to move in with him. After "stuffier viewers" became outraged at the idea of the unwed couple moving in together, the producers decided that they should get married instead. Donovan recalled that the producers thought a wedding would be "the perfect climax" to Scott and Charlene's long-running relationship, as well as an instant ratings winner.
Speaking to James Oram, author of "Neighbours: Behind the Scenes", Minogue thought the marriage would bring controversial subjects, such as pre-marital sex and HIV/AIDS, into focus. Donovan agreed, saying there was "a valid moral point behind it." Executive producer Reg Watson noted how each character in the show expressed a different point of view about the wedding. Some, like Scott's father Jim (Alan Dale), thought it was "stupid" for a couple just out of school to get married, while others, like Charlene's mother Madge (Anne Charleston), believed it was romantic. Watson believed the storyline would have repercussions for everyone.
Filming.
Ray Harding wrote the script for "Episode 523". Bruce Andrews from Charles Sturt University noted that it is one of only a few "Neighbours" episodes to include the entire cast. The producers asked Rod Hardy to direct the episode, due to his experience of directing other television weddings. Hardy believed that "the magic of the episode" is captured best in two close-up shots of Scott and Charlene. The director recalled "The image that stays with me is the close-up of Kylie as she arrives and then the close-up on Jason's face, and those two looks epitomised what the whole scene was about." The episode was shot "in great secrecy" three months before it was broadcast on Australian television. The shoot was initially delayed due to bad weather. Due to a limited budget, there were very few extras on set and crew were asked to stand in at the church instead. The scenes were shot in soft focus, creating "a halo effect" around Charlene as she walked up the aisle.
The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster was used as the location for the wedding. The scenes were shot in the old nave of the church, which was surrounded by "rough-hewn sandstone and glowing stained glass windows." Liz Guiver, the former vicar's secretary and administrator, revealed that many of the church's parishioners were excited at the prospect of seeing the actors on set. Speaking to Guy Blackman from "The Age", Guiver recalled "The person who played the vicar, and wore the vicar's robe, he smoked cigarettes, so we had to be careful that they were dry-cleaned before services on Sunday. Then we waited for months until the episode was aired, and most parishioners were glued to the set." Scenes featuring the character's family homes and Ramsay Street were shot at the show's studio in Forest Hill and at Pin Oak Court in Vermont South respectively. Recalling the shoot, Donovan told the "Herald Sun"'s Nui Te Koha, "I don't remember that particular day well, but when you do set ups like weddings it takes a long, long time to put things together."
Costumes and music.
Charlene's new romantic style wedding dress was designed and made by Isis of Melbourne, a local bridal salon. A writer for the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery's website observed that it was "in keeping with Charlene's character as the suburban girl-next-door." The dress was made from ivory silk, organza and chantilly lace. When asked what made the dress memorable, fashion designer Alex Perry, stated "There are so many things going on that it's hard not to remember it! The see-through sleeves with a hint of lace, the romantic era-style shoulders, the high neckline and hem." Knowing how popular Minogue and Charlene were at the time, Perry was sure that the dress would have been copied by viewers. Charlene's bridesmaids wore peach taffeta dresses, while the groom and his ushers wore charcoal grey tails.
Minogue was asked by the producers to choose a romantic song to be played in the episode and she chose "Suddenly" by Angry Anderson. Anderson had written the song a long time before it was used in "Episode 523". He explained that it is about a man coming to a certain point in his life when he realises that he does not mind being vulnerable. Minogue told Anderson that she loved the song and how the lyrics resonated with her. She later revealed that she wanted the song played at her own wedding. After "Episode 523" was broadcast in the UK, "Suddenly" reached number 3 on the Singles Chart.
Promotion and broadcast.
Network Ten's national publicity director, Brian Walsh, believed the wedding episode would be an ideal marketing opportunity. He arranged for Minogue and Donovan to attend a wedding breakfast at the Park Royal Hotel in Parramatta and invited four hundred competition winners to join them. Minogue and Donovan later made an appearance with the wedding cake at Westfield Parramatta. Walsh recalled "I'd never seen anything like it; there would have been 6000 people. Security had to prevent any more going inside. It was as simple as Jason and Kylie and a wedding cake on stage. There was a speech and the cutting of the cake. Then there was this near riot. We had to stop the appearance at this point to prevent people getting crushed." The actors made several more appearances with replica cakes in shopping centres throughout Sydney and Melbourne. They would cut the cakes and then hand out slices to thousands of fans. The episode later become the main focus on covers of "TIME Australia" and "TV Week". 
"Episode 523" was first broadcast in Australia on 1 July 1987. Just over a year later, the episode aired in the United Kingdom on 8 November 1988.
Home media.
In 1989, Scott and Charlene's wedding was included on a VHS titled "The Neighbours Wedding Collection". In 2002, FremantleMedia included the episode on the "Neighbours: Defining Moments" DVD box set. The episode was also featured on the "Neighbours: The Iconic Episodes Volume 2" DVD box set and the collector's DVD "The Charlene Years – Volume 1" released in 2009 and 2012 respectively.
Reception.
Ratings.
"Episode 523" was seen by two million viewers upon its broadcast in Australia, making it one of the highest rating soap opera episodes. When it aired in the United Kingdom, the episode attracted an audience of 19.6 million, making it the third most watched programme in the country that year.
Critical response.
Kelly Bourne from "TV Week" described the episode, saying "It's the television wedding of the year when "Neighbours" favourite teenage lovers Scott Robinson and Charlene Mitchell tie the knot in a fairytale ceremony." Bourne observed that the wedding would be the most exciting soap opera event of 1987. The head of drama at Network Ten, Rick Maier, stated "Scott and Charlene's wedding was the biggest television event of 1987. Who can forget (Angry Anderson's power ballad and wedding theme) 'Suddenly', the veil, and the kiss. Not only a major turning point for "Neighbours", but a wedding that stopped a nation." "The Sydney Morning Herald's" Michael Idato wrote "Television loves a soap-opera wedding and Australians packed the aisles for the nuptials of star-crossed teenagers Scott and Charlene, played by Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue. The couple kissed, the nation wept and Angry Anderson sang 'Suddenly'." Sarah Megginson from SheKnows quipped "Scott and Charlene's wedding episode is practically the defining episode of what "Neighbours" was all about in the 80s. This episode featured the entire cast, and audiences loved watching the romance of off-screen couple Jason Donovan (Scott) and Kylie Minogue (Charlene) spill over on to the small screen." 
Andrew Mercado, author of "Super Aussie Soaps", called the episode "The biggest event ever in Aussie soap history." Elizabeth Day, writing for "The Guardian", commented "For many, the quintessential on-screen wedding remains the 1987 marriage of Scott and Charlene in Australian daytime soap "Neighbours". It was the apotheosis of a romantic teenage love story which brought together two feuding families – the Robinsons and the Ramsays – in much the same way as the Montagues and the Capulets, albeit with fewer deaths and more shoulder pads." "The Birmingham Post's" Gemma Quade named the wedding one of her five most memorable "Neighbours" storylines, calling it a "tearjerker episode". Josephine Monroe, author of "The Neighbours Programme Guide", wrote that the episode showed the "soap wedding of the century!", adding "Teenagers Scott and Charlene tied the knot in a traditional and emotional church service". During a feature on how to celebrate a wedding ceremony in the style of a soap opera, Tom Cole from the "Radio Times" said "Who needs Mendelssohn and Bach when you can process down the aisle to power ballad 'Suddenly' by Australian rocker Angry Anderson? Sounds unorthodox, but it put pep in the step of Scott and Charlene in "Neighbours". Note to groom: we can't all swan around like we're Jason Donovan, so give the feathered mullet a miss."
Impact and legacy.
The Holy Trinity Church experienced an increase in interest after the episode aired, with some viewers holding their own weddings there. Backpackers also visit the church during their holidays to see the nave where Scott and Charlene were married. The church has since been used again by "Neighbours" to film the weddings of Harold and Madge, Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine) and Drew Kirk (Dan Paris) and Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Charlene's wedding dress was donated to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery by Grundy television in 1989. It has since gone on display in the Powerhouse Museum and travelled to Victoria and the UK. A copy of the episode's script, autographed by Harding, fetched £2,000 when it came up for auction in London.
In October 1997, the serial's longest serving character, Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy), was seen watching a video of Scott and Charlene's wedding, before she died. Kathleen Morgan from the "Daily Record" commented "The wedding video brought back memories of the soap's golden years". Footage of the wedding was later shown during the soap's 20th anniversary episode, "Friends for Twenty Years". Charlene became an iconic bridal image, and when Jane Turner and Gina Riley were writing the 2004 season finale of "Kath & Kim", they asked Minogue to play the character of Epponnee Rae who was due to get married. Executive producer, Rick McKenna, thought that it would be funny for Minogue to dress up as Charlene and the singer agreed. She appeared as a futuristic version of the character, complete with a lacy dress and 80's style hair.
In October 2006, Australia Post brought out five stamps celebrating fifty years of television. Network Ten's stamp featured Charlene and Scott in their wedding attire. In 2007, "Herald Sun" readers voted Scott and Charlene's wedding as their top "Neighbours" moment. A "Herald Sun" reporter said "No other wedding in soap history in Australia has captured the attention like Scott and Charlene's nuptials late in 1987." The episode became FremantleMedia's seventh most requested television clip in 2008. To celebrate the soap's 25th anniversary and its 6000th episode, producers decided to "recreate the magic" of Scott and Charlene's wedding through the marriage of Ringo Brown (Sam Clark) and Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie). Robbie said "People are saying that my wedding is this generation's Kylie (Minogue) and Jason (Donovan) wedding – that's big shoes to fill."
Scott and Charlene's wedding ceremony has often been included in lists about the best television weddings or soap opera moments. It was voted the "Most Romantic TV Nuptials of all Time" and the "Top TV Wedding of all Time" in a "Radio Times" poll. The following year saw the wedding place ninth in a list of the most memorable soap moments. In 2011, the wedding placed third in Channel 5's "Greatest TV Weddings" programme. It also came third in Virgin Media's "10 Best On-screen Nuptials" list. Sky Living included the ceremony in their 2012 feature on the best TV weddings, with a reporter noting that it is probably "Neighbours"' most iconic moment. After including the ceremony in their list of best TV weddings, a writer for MSN New Zealand stated that "it set the standard up to which TV weddings (and terrible mullets) are held."

Leslie Becker

Leslie Becker is an award-winning actress, singer and writer who is best known for her work on Broadway and as the author of the bestselling guide, "The Organized Actor". As an actor, she originated the roles of Cumie Barrow and Governor Miriam Ferguson in the Broadway musical "Bonnie and Clyde", which opened at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre in New York on December 1, 2011. She also originated the role of The Queen in Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella", which opened at Madison Square Garden and toured the country for two years in 2000–2002. In addition, she was in the Broadway production of the Tony Award–winning revival of "Anything Goes", starring Sutton Foster and Joel Gray, the Tony Award–winning revival of "Nine", starring Antonio Banderas. She toured the country in Broadway hits "Wicked", "Show Boat", "Beauty and the Beast" and more.
Early life.
Born in Manhattan Beach, California, Becker's early years were spent juggling her love for performing and athletics. She was a member of the West Side Ballet Company for 10 years, where she performed in the ballet "The Nutcracker" annually, as well as studying classical piano and competing in a girl's softball league and tennis.
She began acting during high school, where she starred in many of the school's productions, including Laurey in "Oklahoma!". Becker holds degrees in Journalism and Advertising from Cal State Fullerton. She continued to perform in professional regional theatres throughout California during her college years, including roles as Liesl in "The Sound of Music", Alice in "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and a role in "42nd Street", all before she was 21.
Professional theater and "The Organized Actor".
After college, Becker played Kathy Selden in "Singin' in the Rain" (4 productions), Sally in "Me and My Girl" (2 productions) and Edith in "My One and Only", winning her several critic awards, including a Drama-Logue Award for Best Actress for her work in "Me and My Girl".
Drawn by her experiences as an actress and entrepreneurial instincts, Becker authored a motivational book for actors, "The Organized Actor". Initially written to help other actors get organized, the title caught fire and is still one of the bestselling organizational tools for actors, already in its 6th edition.
Her big break as an actress came in 1994 when she was cast in the Los Angeles production of Broadway's "Beauty and the Beast", starring Susan Egan and James Barbour. After running nearly two years, she finally made the move to New York and quickly booked the national tour of "Show Boat" and spent 1996–1999 touring the country and starring in several regional roles, including Mary in "It's a Wonderful Life", Cassie in several productions of "A Chorus Line", Emily in "State Fair", Irene in Hello, Dolly! and Anna in "The King and I". Director Victoria Racimo called Becker on for her one-person play, titled "Private Lawrence", based on the life of Gertrude Lawrence, which was sold out in New York City.
The Musical Writers Playground.
In 1998, Becker co-founded The Musical Writers Playground with colleagues DJ Salisbury and VP Boyle in New York City. The group was formed to help musical theater composers and lyricists get their work seen by Broadway producers. The company disbanded in 2004, but the works that she wrote during that time are still in various stages of development. Her musicals include "Fetching Water" with collaborator Michael Hunsaker, "A Proper Place" with collaborator Curtis Rhodes and "Here We Are" with collaborator Mark Wilder. And her commissioned songs are still heard in cabaret venues across the country (many written with composer Mary-Mitchell Campbell) and have been sung by famous Broadway voices, including Marc Kudisch, Lynne Winterstellar, Barbara Walsh, and Celia Keenan Bolger.
Additional Broadway Credits.
While serving as executive director of The Musical Writers Playground, Becker's acting career began to grow, and she was cast as The Queen in Madison Square Garden's production and tour of "Cinderella", starring Eartha Kitt and Deborah Gibson in 2000. Becker received critical acclaim as the "funny, and archly mannered Queen."
Shortly thereafter, she was cast in her first Broadway show, "Nine", starring Antonio Banderas, where she understudied (and performed) ten name actresses, including Chita Rivera, Mary Beth Peil and Sandra Santiago.
"Bonnie and Clyde".
In 2009, Becker originated the roles of Cumie Barrow (the mother of Clyde Barrow) and Governor Miriam Ferguson in the world premiere of Frank Wildhorn's "Bonnie and Clyde" at The La Jolla Playhouse and continued the development at the Asolo Repertory Theatre in Sarasota, Florida in 2010, and finally on Broadway at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, where she was noted for her "powerful strength and ability to bring two dynamic and contrasting roles to life," in 2011–2012. After its short run, she was cast in the Tony Award–winning revival of "Anything Goes", starring Sutton Foster, which closed July 8, 2012.
A Proper Place.
In 2013, Becker reunited with composer Curtis Rhodes to write the new musical A Proper Place which received a private industry reading in September 2013 and was quickly selected for Goodspeed's Festival of New Musicals in January 2014. Becker writes the book and lyrics for the new musical that has been dubbed a cross between Downton Abbey and Gilligan's Island.

Merian family

Merian is a family that were members of the patriciate of Basel in Switzerland. It consists of two branches (an 'elder Basel line' and a 'younger' one) that were included in the Basel citizenship from 1498 and from 1549/1553. The family were represented in the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt in 1532 and grew to become distinguished aldermen. Its notable members include the 18th century politician and the 19th century banker Christoph Merian, who founded a renowned Basel charity institution "Christoph Merian Stiftung".
The younger Basel line includes a Frankfurt sub-branch founded by the engraver Matthäus Merian the Elder (1593-1650), whose descendents also became artists during the Baroque period and ran what became one of Europe's largest publishers in the 17th century.
Origin and distribution.
The family name is not limited to Basel, and is also found (in variants like "Meria, Merian, Meriam" and "von Merian") in Alsace, Lorraine, in Provence, in Lower Austria, and in Mecklenburg. These families are probably not directly related to the Merians of Basel, but a common root is likely in the former Prince-Bishopric of Basel in the earliest forms of the name "Merillate, Merylat, Miregla, Mureglat" or Latinized "Mariatte". The name probably derives from the office of "Meier" (meaning steward or estate manager); unlikely, however, is a speculated relationship to the community of Meria in Corsica or to an alleged Merian Abbey in the Archdiocese of Strasbourg, and the same is unlikely with reference to the Marioni nobility from Milan or to "de Muriaux" in the Bishopric of Basel.
The oldest written reference to the family in the bishopric dates from the year 1385 with the mention of a "Jehannin dit Mariatte de Buratte" ("'Johann, called Mariatte, citizens, bears witness'"), who resided in a dairy at Bure, Switzerland. This dairy farm had belonged since 1283 to the bishops of Basel, before the dukes of Alsace and the Counts of Mömpelgard/Montbéliard and von Pfirt/Ferrette.
Naturalisation in Basel.
The founding father of all the Merians of Basel is one "Theobald Merian" (c.1415 – c.1505), a Basel episcopal bailiff or steward in Lüttelsdorf (now Courroux) in the Swiss canton of Jura. From him are descended the two Basel branches of the family. The elder line stems from his son "Theobald Merian" (1465 - 1544), who went in 1480 as a seaman of Lüttelsdorf to Basel and later operated a sawmill on the right bank of the Rhine in Kleinbasel. The younger line from "Johann Petrus Merian" (c.1468/1478 - after 1519) is thought to be related, as he was an episcopal steward who also came from Lüttelsdorf to Basel, but whether Theobald (the son) and Johann Petrus were brothers and both therefore sons of Theobald (the father) as tradition claims, is unproven.
Frankfurt sub-branch.
In 1624 the Swiss-born engraver Matthäus Merian (a descendent of the younger line) took over the Frankfurt publishing house of his father-in-law Johann Theodor de Bry, and in 1626 he acquired Frankfurt citizenship. After his death in 1650 two of his sons, Matthäus Merian the Younger and Caspar, built up the publishing house under the name "Matthäus Merian Seel". In 1687 the publishing house was inherited by a third generation family member, Johann Matthäus Merian (1659-1716), the second son of Matthäus the Younger. Johann's elder brother Carl Gustav Merian was later elevated to the nobility by the Elector of Mainz and appointed to the Privy Council. After Johann's death in 1716 the company was led by his niece Charlotte Maria Merian (1691-1729) until its dissolution in 1727. The Frankfurt family line died with the painter Carl Matthäus Merian (1705-1770), a great-grandson of Matthäus Merian the Elder. The family name is remembered today in Frankfurt's Merianstrasse and Merianplatz, and in Merian School in Nordend.

Sundark and Riverlight stylised "Sun☽ark and Riverlight" is a double album released by English-Irish singer-songwriter Patrick Wolf on 15 October 2012. under his own label, Bloody Chamber Music, and Essential Music.
Background.
The double album will mark ten years since Wolf's debut studio album, Lycanthropy and will contain re-recorded, acoustic versions of chosen songs from the previous ten years. The first disc, "Sundark", will feature "more solitary darker material" and "songs that were written in loneliness and not really thinking about other people", while the second disc, "Riverlight", will include "songs of hope and relationship" and "isolation and solitude on one and togetherness". Buffy Sainte-Marie co-wrote the new version of "Hard Times" after they met in Barcelona during the recording session.
Wolf wrote a letter to talk about the album. In the letter, he says, ""I thought It was time after a decade to take a moment to document what these songs have grown up to be while I’ve been travelling them around the world."" ""There was a conscious rebellion on this album against the digital age of auto-tune and mass produced electronic landfill music. I want to present at my 10-year anniversary a musical biography."" He cites Stephan Micus, Shirley and Dolly Collins's "Love, Death and the Lady" as influences to the album. The album is also dedicated to Wolf's Russian fans.
The album was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios. Gabriel also lent his Bösendorfer grand piano, Bodhrán and Hammered dulcimer to Wolf.
The title of the album is taken from the song "London", from Lycanthropy, which begins "Sun dark on darker streets, it's violent times for weary feet..." and ends with "Forget me, I wash myself in your grey river light".
Album artwork.
The album artwork was shot at Hilles House in Gloucester, a country mansion looking over the River Severn, the former home of baroque composer John Blow and fashion designer Isabella Blow.
The house is known for inspiring the renowned, late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.
Singles.
The version of "Overture", originally from the album "The Magic Position", was released on YouTube in late August. It then became available on iTunes as a single on 7 September.

List of United States federal officials convicted of corruption offenses

This list only includes federal officials convicted of certain select corruption crimes.
For a more complete list see: List of American federal politicians convicted of crimes and List of federal political scandals in the United States.
Dozens of high-level United States federal officials have been convicted of public corruption offenses for conduct while in office. These officials have been convicted under two types of statutes. The first type are also applicable to corrupt state and local officials: the mail and wire fraud statutes (enacted 1872), including the honest services fraud provision, the Hobbs Act (enacted 1934), the Travel Act (enacted 1961), and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (enacted 1970). In addition, federal officials are subject to the federal bribery, graft, and conflict-of-interest crimes contained in Title 18, Chapter 11 of the United States Code, 18 U.S.C. §§ 201–227, which do not apply to state and local officials. Most notably, § 201(b) prohibits the receipt of bribes, and § 201(c) prohibits the receipt of unlawful gratuities, by federal public officials. Lesser used statutes include conspiracy to defraud the United States (enacted 1867) and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) (enacted 1977).
Where the defendant is a member of the United States Congress, the Speech or Debate Clause of Article One of the United States Constitution—providing that: "any Speech or Debate in either House, [Senators or Representatives shall not be questioned in any other Place"—limits the acts which may be charged and the evidence that may be introduced.
Inclusion criteria and organization.
Only high-level federal officials are included in this list. For the executive branch, this means the President, Vice President, and Cabinet members (i.e. officials compensated at Level I of the Executive Schedule). For the legislative branch, this means members of the Congress, whether the Senate or House of Representatives. For the judicial branch, this means Article Three judges. Lower-level officials are not included on this list, although they may be prosecuted for the same offenses.
Acquitted officials are not listed (if an official was acquitted on some counts, and convicted on others, the counts of conviction are listed). If a defendant is convicted of a conspiracy to commit a corruption offense, the substantive offense is listed. Convictions such as making false statements, perjury, obstruction of justice, electoral fraud, violations of campaign finance regulations, tax evasion and money laundering are not included in this list. Censure, impeachment, and removal from office are also not included in this list.
The list is organized by office. The criminal statute(s) under which the conviction(s) were obtained are noted, as are the names of notable investigations, scandals, or litigation, if applicable. The year of conviction is included (if the official was convicted multiple times due to retrials, only the year of the first conviction is included). Certain details, including post-conviction relief, if applicable, are included in footnotes. Political affiliation is also included.

Hamilton Lawn Tennis Club

Hamilton Lawn Tennis Club (HLTC) is a tennis club located at Blackswell Lane in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. The club has 4 artificial, all weather courts and has recently invested almost a quarter of a million pounds in a large modern clubhouse, new car parking facilities, landscpaing and improved floodlighting. The Club has a mixture of all ages and abilities.
Formation.
The actual formation of the club goes back a long way. On 26 March 1884, a meeting of gentlemen who were for the formation of the lawn tennis club was held in a Hamilton hotel. HLTC was the third lawn tennis club to be formed in Scotland, and was formed seven years after the world-famous All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon was formed.
Location of club.
A sub-committee was elected in the year of HLTC's formation, before a site for the club was found. Various different fields and premises were explored by the sub-committee, who eventually decided to rent out fields in Auchincampbell. They were to play there for a year before moving again due to high rental costs. 
HLTC re-located to a site in Hutton Bank, Hamilton, where two ash courts were created, the weather back then having a major influence on the change from lawn to ash. On 30 March 1885, the club were admitted into the West of Scotland Tennis Association. A year later, a clubhouse was built and two further courts were constructed. The Duke of Hamilton was known to be the president of the club in 1898.
Death and Re-birth.
HLTC went into liquidation in 1902 as some of the premises were lost due to road construction, but immediately afterwards the club was reborn in premises at Blackswell Lane. A new company known as Ballantyne & Jackson constructed new courts for just £2, and paid extra for working order of the courts and nets. It is known that in 1922, the new courts were purchased by the Duke of Hamilton. During World War II, the courts were closed and covered over to give working war troops a dancefloor for leisure time.
The club today.
As of 2013, the HLTC has 4 artificial grass courts, and a set of free floodlights. There is no joining fee for any new members of the club, and the club is open to new members irrespective of age and ability. The club is based approximately 100 metres from the Regent Shopping Centre in the town centre. The club is run by volunteer members for members. All money generated at the club goes back into facilities as well as ensuring that fees remain affordable and that floodlights and tennis balls are provided free of charge.
Club successes.
The club has won the junior calcutta cup on a number of occasions in recent years, and won the senior calcutta cup in 2011. The Men's first team plays in division 1 in the west of scotland leagues, and players from the club regularly win tournaments around the Glasgow area. The club also started its own annual tournament in 2013. 
There is also an extensive coaching programme for juniors and adults catering for beginners and advanced players. The coaching programme is run by head coach Ian Cannon supported by assistant coaches Stuart Annetts, Euan Clarke and Murray Whitelaw.

Human rights in Tunisia

The issue of Human rights in Tunisia, is complex, contradictory, and, in some regards, confusing in the wake of a revolution that began in December 2010 and overthrew the longstanding dictatorship of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. While the immediate months after the revolution were characterized by significant improvements in the status of human rights, some of those advances have since been reversed. The entire situation, however, remains in a state of considerable flux, with different observers sometimes providing virtually irreconcilable accounts of the current status of human rights in that country.
Long labeled “Not Free” by Freedom House, Tunisia was upgraded to “Partly Free” after the revolution, its political rights rating improving from 7 to 3 (with 7 the worst and 1 the best) and its civil liberties rating going from 5 to 4.
Pre-revolutionary situation and post-revolutionary developments.
A U.S. State Department report, issued in April 2011 depicts the status of human rights in that country on the eve of the revolution, citing “restrictions on freedom of speech, press and association,” the “severe” intimidation of journalists, reprisals against critical of the government, questionable conduct of elections, and reports of arbitrary arrest, widespread corruption, official extortion, government influence over the judiciary, extremely poor prison conditions, and the abuse and torture of detainees and prisoners, involving a wide range of torture methods. Defendants did not enjoy the right to a speedy trial, and access to evidence was often restricted; in cases involving family and inheritance law, judges often ignored civil law and applied sharia instead. 
Although the principal cause of the revolt was a frustration over the country's dire economic situation, many leaders of the revolution were longtime human-rights activists and many participants shared their hope of replacing autocracy with a democratic government and a civil society in which human rights were respected. As Christopher de Bellaigue noted in an article posted at the New York Review of Books website on December 18, 2012, Tunisia's new constitution is, “give or take a few vague references to Islam, strikingly secular. (It does not mention the Sharia, for instance, and guarantees equal rights for all Tunisian men and women.)” 
The revolution initiated what Amnesty International has described as “a wholesale process of reform” under which “political prisoners, including prisoners of conscience, were released; legal restrictions on political parties and NGOs were eased; the Department of State Security (DSS), notorious for torturing detainees with impunity, was dissolved; Tunisia became party to additional international human rights treaties; and a new National Constituent Assembly was elected with a mandate to draft and agree a new Constitution.” 
In July 2011, the UN opened its first human-rights office in north Africa. “The whole world watched with amazement and growing respect as Tunisians kept demanding your rights, refusing to be cowed by the repression, the arrests, the torture and all the injuries and tragic loss of life that occurred,” the High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said at the official opening of the office. “The impact of these actions, on Tunisia itself, on the wider region, and indeed all across the world is hard to measure and is far from completed. But it has unquestionably been enormous and truly inspirational.” She noted that in the previous three weeks, Tunisia had ratified four major treaties: the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the UN Convention on Enforced Disappearances, and the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court. 
Since the revolution, however, according to de Bellaigue, “tensions have risen sharply between the three partners” in the post-revolutionary government, “not least because the divisions between Islamists and secularists that the coalition was designed to bridge, or at least camouflage, are now obvious...increasingly, secularists and religious conservatives have been drawn into a vigorous culture war, in which the former invoke human rights, and the latter, Islamic law.” Moreover, under the current regime, as Amnesty International had pointed out, there have been “continuing human rights violations,” with security forces using excessive force against protesters, who have also been mistreated while in detention. 
The UN Special Rapporteur on Truth, Justice, Reparations and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence, Pablo de Greiff, urged Tunisian authorities in November 2012 to put human rights front and center in their transitional efforts. In December 2012, at a World Human Rights Day ceremony in Carthage attended by several top Tunisian government officials, President Marzouki, while complaining about “an excessive freedom of expression of some media,” lamented that “the path towards the construction of a human rights Tunisia is still difficult and full of traps.” One difficulty was that many Tunisians consider the new constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be at odds with Islamic values. 
Marzouki admitted that security officials need to undergo a radical change of mindset, while Speaker of the National Constituent Assembly Mustapha Ben Jaafar expressed thanks for the help given to the new regime by a number of human rights organisations. Problems aside, said Ben Jaafar, Tunisia's democratization was “on the right track” and the country was “moving towards a consensus on the new Constitution.” The President of the National Union of Tunisian Judges, Raoudha Labidi, however, charged that the exclusion of judges from the human-rights event represented a denial of judges' pre-revolutionary struggle, “adding that the judicial service is the guarantor of human rights and individual freedoms in the country.” 
In a December 2012 article, Dorra Megdiche Meziou took a cynical view of the Human Rights Day event. While acknowledging “the historic achievements of the incumbent President of the Republic, Moncef Marzouki, as a human rights activist,” noting that he had been on “the steering committee of the Arab Organization for Human Rights,” belonged to “the Tunisian branch of Amnesty International,” served as “president of the Arab Committee for Human Rights,” and “co-founded the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia,” and while further acknowledging that Mustapha Ben Jaafar, too, had helped advance human rights as “a main figure in the Tunisian opposition,” Meziou complained that “serious violations and infringements of human rights” remain in today's Tunisia, and called on “these former activists of human rights who are now in power to get to work and translate their words into actions.” 
In October 2012, Amnesty International said that Tunisia's revolutionary reforms had been eroded, with recent months seeing “new restrictions on freedom of expression targetting journalists, artists, critics of the government, writers and bloggers,” leading to a journalists' strike. Also, protesters complaining that reforms have not been instituted quickly enough, “have been met with unnecessary and excessive force.” In addition, Human Rights Watch documented the government's failure to look into attacks on political activists by radical Islamic groups. Amnesty International admitted to “doubt” regarding the commitment of Tunisia's new leaders to reform, saying that “Tunisia is at a crossroads” and calling for “urgent steps...to realise the rights and freedoms for which Tunisians fought so tenaciously and bravely in late 2010 and early 2011.”
Basic rights.
Tunisia, according to de Bellaigue, “has taken important strides toward a more representative and accountable political system. The institutions are working, albeit imperfectly. Freedom of speech is being observed to a degree that is unprecedented in the country’s modern history. To be sure, secularists and Islamists exert themselves to ensure that their view of the world carries the day, but I have spoken to hard-liners in both camps who accept that, for as long as the majority opposes them, compromise is inevitable.” 
After the revolution, moreover, Tunisia became the first nation in the Arab world “to legally enshrine gender parity in the electoral rolls.” According to Freedom House, the October 2011 elections “represented a dramatic improvement in electoral freedoms and practices. Under the former regime of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the cabinet, much of the legislature, and many regional officials had been appointed directly by the president. Elections were tightly controlled, and term limits were extended to allow Ben Ali to remain in power. By contrast, in the 2011 elections, all 217 members of the Constituent Assembly were directly elected through party-list voting in 33 multimember constituencies, and voters were able to choose from political parties representing a wide range of ideologies and political philosophies, including Islamist and secularist groups. Many of the parties that competed were excluded from political participation under Ben Ali.” 
Dorra Megdiche Meziou complained in December 2012 about “groups that call themselves 'the Leagues for the Protection of the Revolution' (LPR),” which despite its involvement in a political assassination and in an attack on members of the UGTT federation of unions, had been defended by the ruling party, whose leader had called the LPR “the conscience of the people.”
Right of free expression.
Post-revolutionary press laws are considerably more liberal than the legislation they replaced. While it is no longer a crime to defame or offend public officials or institutions, defamation in general remains a crime, although one that is not punishable by imprisonment. Defamation of recognized religions also remains a crime, as does “distributing false information”, a charge on which the pre-revolutionary government prosecuted dissidents and human rights activists. This charge was used by the post-revolutionary government on May 29, 2012, to detain police official Samir Feriani, who had accused high-ranking government officials in the death of protesters during the revolution. 
The new government has also failed in some cases to protect individuals exercising their free speech. On June 29, 2012, when dozens of Muslims charged into a screening in Tunis of a movie about atheism, police failed to respond. In October 2012, a prosecutor announced plans to investigate a complaint against Nessma TV for broadcasting a film that Muslims considered offensive. Although persons who vandalized and attempted to set fire to the home of Nessma TV co-owner Nebil Karaoui were arrested, they were “detained only briefly and not charged,” whereas Karaoui and two Nessma TV employees are still awaiting trial on charges of “undermining sacred values.” 
In December 2012, Human Rights Watch called on Tunisia’s justice minister to “ensure the immediate release of Sami Fehri, the director of the privately owned Attounissia TV channel,” who remained in prison after Tunisia's highest court, the Court of Cassation, had ordered his immediate release on November 28. Although Fehri had been charged with embezzlement, Fehri claimed that the real reason for his arrest was his broadcasting of a satirical show about leading Tunisian politicians. “Refusing to carry out a ruling by the highest judicial authority undermines the rule of law in Tunisia,” said Eric Goldstein of Human Rights Watch. 
Academic freedom, which was seriously limited before the revolution, has been significantly expanded.
Religious freedom.
Freedom House has noted that Tunisia's “small populations of Jews and Christians have generally been free to practice their faiths,” and that following the revolution “conservative and fundamentalist Muslims had more freedom to express their beliefs without state interference and to openly discuss the role that religion should play in the public sphere.”
Women's rights.
After taking power, the post-revolutionary government accepted in principle equality between women and men in elections. Human Rights Watch has noted that “Tunisia, long viewed as the most progressive Arab country with respect to women’s rights, marked additional advances in this field” as a result of the revolution. For example, the Council of Ministers decided to withdraw Tunisia’s reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, though the government suggested “it might not implement reforms that conflict with Islam.” 
Furthermore, Tunisia bans polygamy and the Islamic practice by which a man can divorce his wife with a simple declaration. Men and women have equal divorce rights and are required to undergo a judicial process to receive a divorce. The minimum age for marriage for both men and women is 18; since 1993, women have enjoyed the right to pass their names and nationalities to their children. As one observer has noted, in Tunis, unlike many cities in the Muslim world, “unmarried young men and women mingle openly together in coffee shops and restaurants. Most of the men are clean-shaven and dressed in modern European styles. The women are not veiled; many of them wear makeup and do not have headscarves.” Still, discrimination persists under law and in daily life, with women still denied equal rights in inheritance and custody matters.
Children's rights.
According to pre-revolutionary laws, Tunisian children inherited their citizenship from: a Tunisian father; a Tunisian mother and an unknown father; a Tunisian mother and a father who has no nationality; or birth in Tunisia to a Tunisian mother and a foreign father. Children were entitled to free education up to and including university. School attendance was mandatory up to age 16. Under the pre-revolutionary government there were severe penalties for assaulting minors, but prosecution of such offenses was extremely rare. Government-employed social workers assisted abused children, and the Ministry of Women's Affairs, Family, Children, and Elderly Persons “employed a child protection delegate in each of the country's 24 districts to intervene in cases of sexual, economic, or criminal exploitation of children.” Presumably these rules and protections are still in place in post-revolutionary Tunisia.
Rights of asylum seekers and refugees.
Many people fled to Tunisia in 2011, including Libyans fleeing the revolution in that country. Some were returned home but at the end of 2011 several thousand remained at a refugee camp on the Libyan border. Human Rights Watch described the situation as a “humanitarian crisis,” noting that “Tunisia hosted at least 195,241 third-country nationals” as of mid 2011, and that “the military authorities—aided by Tunisian civil society, international organizations, and volunteers—made significant efforts to respond to the humanitarian needs.”
Rights of disabled persons.
Pre-revolutionary Tunisian law banned, and presumably post-revolutionary law still prohibits, discrimination against disabled persons. The prewar law required that “at least 1 percent of public and private sector jobs be reserved for persons who have disabilities,” but many employers were not even aware of this law. Prior to the revolution, the government had “increased vocational training programs in handicrafts geared toward persons who have disabilities,” and a 1991 required new public buildings to be accessible to the disabled. Before the revolution, it was the job of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Solidarity, and Tunisians Abroad to protect disabled rights, and this is presumably still the case.
LGBT rights.
One group that has not benefited noticeably from the Tunisian revolution is LGBT people. “While the fall of Ben Ali has afforded a greater space to free expression, not all Tunisian homosexuals are convinced things are headed in the right direction,” reported the Tunisia Live website in January 2012. 
“Homosexuals in Tunisia celebrated the ouster of dictator Ben Ali, hoping it would improve their situation,” noted Deutsche Welle in November 2012. “But in nearly two years, little has changed for the country's gay and lesbian community.” Under Article 230 of the penal code, anal intercourse can still be punished by up to three years in prison. In June 2012, Tunisia's Minister for Human Rights vehemently rejected a call by the United Nations Human Rights Committee to decriminalize same-sex acts, dismissing sexual orientation as a Western concept and insisting on its incompatibility with Islam. 
A good deal of anecdotal evidence suggests that harassment and assaults by police officers and others on LGBT persons continue to be widespread. 
In August 2012, a gay Italian tourist identified as Angelo was murdered in the Tunisian resort town of Hammamet by a local who stabbed him 10 times. A friend claimed that he had cried for help but that “his plea went unanswered because he was gay.” She described a man who kept eating a bowl of soup “just a few feet from the man’s murder” and she also maintained that “townspeople spoke as if Angelo deserved to die because of his homosexuality and children laughed at the tragedy.” Commenting on the murder, a Tunisian editor for Gay Middle East said that “human rights in general and LGBT rights in particular” are “getting worse in Tunisia...Society hated gays before Ben Ali, but under new ruling party Ennahda, homosexuality is used as political weapon even more rigorously than in Ben Ali’s time.”
Michael Lucas, referring in The Advocate in December 2012 to the closeted gay life of pre-revolutionary Tunisia, claimed that the situation “has gotten even darker in the past two years. Laws against homosexual activity were rarely enforced under Ben Ali, a pro-Western military leader whose regime helped insulate Tunisia from the rising tide of religious fanaticism that has engulfed much of the Muslim world. But the new government of Tunisia is officially Islamist...Gay Tunisians tell me that arrests for homosexuality have been on the rise, sometimes resulting in jail terms of up to three years, from which some prisoners—victims of harassment, rape and violence from other inmates—never return. Before 2011, transsexuals and drag queens could be seen in the streets; now they have disappeared.” 
There is still no official LGBT rights organization in Tunisia, although an online magazine for gays was established in March 2011.
Employee rights.
Before the revolution, Tunisian law technically allowed workers to join unions, but this right was not always respected. All unions belonged to the UGTT, a federation that was technically independent but whose leaders were often subject to government harassment and to limitations on their freedom of action. Strikes were subject to UGTT approval, a requirement that the International Trade Union Conference called a violation of employee rights, but in practice unions rarely asked for such approval. 
Collective bargaining was permitted and protected. Forced labor was illegal, although some girls were compelled to work as domestic servants, and there were rules governing work by children, with those under 16 generally forbidden to work, although in practice many children “performed agricultural work in rural areas and worked as vendors in towns.” 
The UGTT played a major role in the revolution but “has become the main opposition force” against the new government. During the post-revolutionary period it “has been flexing its muscles,” announcing a general strike that was called off after talks with government officials.
Rights of persons under arrest.
Post-revolutionary amendments to Tunisia's law on torture brought it more into line with international law. Though there continue to be accusations of torture, such incidents are far less common than before the revolution. Most such accusations concern the beating of protestors at demonstrations or at police stations. Freedom House notes that human-rights reforms have not taken place in the law-enforcement sector as extensively as in other spheres of Tunisian society. And Amnesty International has noted that while Tunisia's post-revolutionary Interior Ministry planned sweeping police reforms, it has not addressed pre-revolutionary human-rights violations by the police and others in authority. 
Meziou noted in December 2012 that the post-revolutionary government was arresting people but not bringing them to trial. “Some of the officials from the former regime have been under arrest for almost two years and they are still awaiting trial, which does not seem imminent,” she wrote. Also, young demonstrators in various places around the country had been arrested and were awaiting trial under “miserable conditions.”
Rights of persons on trial.
Before the revolution, according to Freedom House, Tunisia's judiciary “was carefully managed by the executive branch, which controlled the appointment and assignment of judges. Trials of suspected Islamists, human rights activists, and journalists were typically condemned as grossly unfair and politically biased by domestic and international observers.” While such abuses “declined significantly in 2011,” and the judiciary underwent “some changes,” the courts, like law-enforcement agencies, “have been criticized for lagging behind other institutions in their pace of reform, and there is a significant backlog of cases related to abuses by members of the former regime and security forces that have yet to be officially addressed.” 
At a series of workshops offered in 2012 by the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute, the International Legal Assistance Consortium, and the CEELI Institute, the majority of Tunisian judges were provided with training about human rights and the role of judges in a democratic society. In October 2012, however, Human Rights Watch criticized Tunisia's justice minister for dismissing 75 judges, calling on Tunisia's parliament to “urgently pass a law to create an independent body to govern the discipline and dismissal of judges in an impartial and transparent manner.”
Rights of persons in prison.
Prison conditions in Tunisia have long been considered extremely substandard, with overcrowding and violence among the major problems. “Hygiene was extremely poor, and prisoners rarely had access to showers and washing facilities,” according to a U.S. State Department report issued in early 2011. Typically, up to fifty inmates were confined in “a single 194-square-foot cell, and as many as 140 prisoners shared a 323-square-foot cell. Most prisoners were forced to share beds or sleep on the floor. Current and former prisoners reported that the lack of basic facilities forced inmates to share a single water and toilet facility with more than 100 cellmates, creating serious sanitation problems. Contagious diseases, particularly scabies, were widespread, and prisoners did not have access to adequate medical care.” A U.S. State Department report issued in early 2012 described prison conditions as “varied” and noted that while two prisons observed in February by Human Rights Watch had been overcrowded, the situation was expected to improve as the result of an amnesty that “freed thousands of political prisoners detained during the Ben Ali era.” The report indicated, however, that up-to-date, comprehensive information about post-revolutionary prison conditions was hard to come by. 
Although the death penalty has not technically been abolished, post-revolutionary Tunisia has maintained the moratorium on executions that was put in place in 1991.

Ottla Kafka

Ottilie "Ottla" Kafka (29 October 1892 – 1943) was the youngest sister of Franz Kafka. His favourite sister, she was probably also his closest relative and supported him in difficult times. Their correspondence was published as "Letters to Ottla".
Life.
Ottilie, called Ottla by her family, was born in Prague, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, into a middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish family. Her father was the businessman Hermann Kafka (1852–1931), her mother, Julie (1856–1934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a brewer in Poděbrady. She had three siblings, Franz, Gabriele ("Ellie") (1889–1944) and Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1944). She was Franz's favourite sister. She was a close confidant ("enge Vertraute"), and he called her "unbeschadet der Liebe zu den anderen, die bei weitem liebste" (the love to the others notwithstanding, the dearest by far). He helped her get an education at an agricultural school. She lived and worked at the agricultural estate of her brother-in-law, Karl Hermann, in West Bohemian Zürau (now Siřem, community Blšany). In 1916–17, she provided her brother with a writing refuge where he was able to write many short stories, and he also lived on Hermann's estate from September 1917 to April 1918, already suffering from tuberculosis. During this time he wrote "Die Zürauer Aphorismen" ("The Zürau Aphorisms").
In July 1920, Ottla married the Czech Catholic Joseph David, against her father's will. Their daughters Věra and Helene were born in 1921 and 1923. Franz Kafka watched them grow up until he died in June 1924. The marriage was not happy and they were divorced in August 1942. Ottla thus lost her protection against the persecution of Jews.
Like many other Jews from Prague, Ottla and her sisters were deported during World War II by the Nazis. Elli and Valli were sent with their families to the Łódź Ghetto, where they perished. Ottla was sent to the concentration camp at Theresienstadt. On 7 October 1943, Ottla accompanied a group of children as a voluntary assistant to Auschwitz concentration camp, where she was murdered a short time later.
Legacy.
The correspondence between Franz and Ottla Kafka is preserved. It was first published in 1974 by Hartmut Binder and Klaus Wagenbach, and published in English as "Letters to Ottla & the Family". In January 2011 it was announced that the original letters were to be sold as a bundle at a Berlin auction house. The German Literature Archive in Marbach hoped to be able to obtain it with help from the private sector; in April 2011 they and the Bodleian Library in Oxford acquired it. They thanked Ottla's heirs for their willingness to sell before the auction, and those who assisted in making it possible to raise the needed funds, including one generous donor who remained anonymous at his own request.

Radio Reference

The Attorney General of Quebec v The Attorney General of Canada and others, also known as the Radio Reference, is a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that determined that broadcasting fell within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under the "British North America Act, 1867".
Background.
When the "British North America Act, 1867" was originally drafted, broadcasting had not yet been invented. By the 1920s, Canada had already entered into international agreements on the subject, and there was intense debate as to which level of government in Canada had jurisdiction to regulate this field. Quebec decided to pose reference questions to its appellate court on the matter, and the federal government decided to preempt that hearing by posing the following questions to the Supreme Court of Canada:
Initial ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada.
In a 3-2 decision, the SCC held that radio communication is subject to the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. In his opinion, Anglin C.J.C. supported the statement by Newcombe J. that:
and thus noted:
Therefore, radio broadcasting could not be considered to be a matter of a local or private nature, but more properly fell within the definition of "telegraphs" in Section 92(10).
Smith J. also concurred. In dissenting opinions, Rinfret J. and Lamont J. held that the Parliament of Canada did not have jurisdiction to legislate on the subject of radio communication in every respect. It fell within the primary legislative jurisdiction of the provinces either under property and civil rights or under local works and undertakings of section 92 of the "B.N.A. Act", except in cases where the Dominion Parliament has superseding jurisdiction under some of the heads of section 91 and under section 132 (relating to treaties) of the "B.N.A. Act".
Appeal to the Privy Council.
The Privy Council, in a ruling delivered by Viscount Dunedin, held that the reasoning of the majority at the SCC was correct. He noted the following reasons why the minority opinions failed:
Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.
Impact.
Federal jurisdiction over radio broadcasting was later held to include television broadcasting and cable television systems. However, broadcasting has been held not to include the operations of internet service providers.
The question of whether federal jurisdiction over broadcasting includes control of the content of broadcasting has also been answered by the courts. In "Re C.F.R.D. and Attorney-General of Canada et al.", Justice Kelly affirmed the federal government's authority to regulate programme content. Chief Justice Laskin delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court in "Capital Cities Communications v. CRTC". The Court concluded that programme content regulation is inseparable from regulating the undertaking through which programmes are received and sent on as part of the total enterprise. 
It appears, therefore, that the decision handed down in the "Radio Reference" case has subsequently been interpreted to include federal government authority to regulate all facets of the broadcasting industry,including content. Parliament, through its regulatory agency, has utilized this power in an attempt to create and maintain a national broadcasting system that would"contribute to the development of national unity and provide for a continuing expression of Canadian identity" The Canadian content regulations are merely one aspect of the means accepted to achieve that end.

Prince Albert Impact Crater

The Prince Albert Impact Crater is a probable meteorite impact crater located on Prince Albert Peninsula, in the northwestern part of Victoria Island in Canada's Northwest Territories. The crater was discovered in 2010 by Brian Pratt, professor of geology at the University of Saskatchewan, and Keith Dewing of the Geological Survey of Canada while they were doing an aerial survey of the region. The crater is estimated to have formed between 130 and 350 million years ago, and may have been created when a meteor struck the Earth.
It is Canada's 30th known meteorite impact feature.

Loyn Bridge

Loyn Bridge (or Loyne Bridge) crosses the River Lune, carrying a minor road between the villages of Hornby and Gressingham in Lancashire, England. The present bridge replaces an older bridge, which is thought to have been constructed with timber decking between stone piers. There is evidence that the river was forded here before a bridge was built. The date of the building of the present bridge is unknown; it is considered to have been after 1591, when the previous bridge was described as being "in a dangerous condition". A date of 1684 has been suggested, but petitions regarding the bridge put before the Quarter Sessions between 1650 and 1750 make no mention of a new bridge between these dates. The bridge was paid for by the County of Lancashire, and later the responsibility for maintenance and repairs was transferred to the Lonsdale Hundred.
The bridge is constructed in sandstone blocks, and consists of three segmental arches with triangular cutwaters containing refuges for pedestrians. The arches measure , and respectively. The carriageway is wide, and the maximum width of the bridge at the points of the piers is . It is described as being "surprisingly impressive for a route that has little significance nowadays". There has been little change to it since it was built, other than replacing the parapet with more modern stonework, and replacing the original paving of the carriageway with a tarmacadam surface. When the bridge was surveyed in 1998, it was found to be adequate to carry vehicles of 40 tonnes. It is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building, and is a scheduled monument.

Effects of sleep deprivation in space

Studies, which include laboratory investigations and field evaluations of population groups that are analogous to astronauts (e.g., medical and aviation personnel), provide compelling evidence that working long shifts for extended periods of time contributes to sleep deprivation and can cause performance decrements, health problems, and other detrimental consequences, including accidents, that can affect both the worker and others.
Performance errors relative to sleep loss and extended wakefulness.
A meta-analysis that was conducted by Pilcher and Huffcutt examined data that were drawn from 19 research studies to characterize the effects of sleep deprivation on specific types of human performance. Motor skills, cognitive skills, and mood were assessed in terms of: partial sleep derivation (also known as sleep deprivation), which is defined as fewer than 5 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period for 1 or more days; short-term total sleep deprivation (no sleep attained for fewer than 45 hours); and long-term sleep deprivation (no sleep attained for a period in excess of 45 hours). These researchers found that sleep-deprived subjects performed considerably worse on motor tasks, cognitive tasks, and measures of mood than did non-sleep-deprived subjects. The greatest impact on cognitive performance was seen from multiple days of partial sleep deprivation, although short- and long-term sleep deprivation also showed an effect. Meta-analyses of sleep deprivation effects in medical residents found deficits in both laboratory tasks and clinical tasks.
The magnitude of the chronic partial sleep loss has been experienced by astronauts in flight has been reported to negatively impact cognitive performance in multiple , and laboratory and field studies. Performance can be affected whether sleep loss is in the form of a night of substantially reduced sleep, a night of total sleep deprivation, or a series of less drastic, but more chronic, restricted sleep hours. A 1997 study by Dinges et al. revealed that when sleep is restricted to the level that is commonly experienced by astronauts, a "sleep debt" accrues and, in less than 1 week, performance deficits during waking hours reach levels of serious impairment.
Chronic reduction of sleep can impact performance in a manner that is similar to that of total sleep deprivation. A study by Van Dongen et al., which used 48 subjects, evaluated the specific performance effects of chronic sleep restriction in comparison to the effects of 3 nights of total sleep deprivation. Sleep restriction conditions included 14 consecutive nights of 8, 6, or 4 hours of sleep opportunity, with actual sleep quantity validated by polysomnography recordings. Subjects who were subjected to sleep restriction conditions underwent neurobehavioral assessments every 2 hours during their scheduled wakefulness, while subjects who were subjected to the sleep deprivation condition were tested every 2 hours throughout their total 88 hours of sleep deprivation.
The neurobehavioral assessment battery that was used in the Van Dongen et al. study included the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). The PVT - which determines alertness and the effects of fatigue on cognitive performance (as determined by lapses in response time and accuracy of responses) by measuring the speed with which subjects respond to a visual or auditory stimulus (by pressing a response button) - has become a standard laboratory tool for the assessment of sustained performance in a variety of experimental conditions. The PVT detects changes in basic neurobehavioral performance that involve vigilant attention, response speed, and impulsivity; and it has been extensively validated in ground-based laboratory studies to detect cognitive deficits that are caused by a variety of factors (e.g., restricted sleep, sleep/wake shifts, motion sickness, residual sedation from sleep medications). The PVT is an optimal tool for repeated use, in contrast to some other cognitive measures, as studies have shown no minimal learning effects and aptitude differences when using the PVT.
Results from these laboratory studies indicate that multiple consecutive sleep episodes of 4 or 6 hours significantly erode performance on the PVT and on measures of working memory, and that performance under these two conditions (i.e., 4 or 6 hours) was comparable to the performance that is found under conditions of 1 to 2 days of total sleep deprivation. Surprisingly, by the end of the 14 days of sleep restriction, subjects in the 4- and 6-hour sleep period conditions reported feeling only slightly sleepy. As these reports were taken when performance was at its lowest level, this indicates that the subjects may no longer have been aware of their performance deficits because of inadequate recovery sleep (figure 3-2).
Subjects who spent 4 hours in bed reached levels of impairment at 6 days and of severe impairment at 11 days. Subjects who spent 6 hours in bed reached levels of impairment t 7 days. Interestingly, it appears that subjects who spent 8 hours in bed approached levels of impairment. Figure 3-3, which is from Belenky et al., however, demonstrates that subjects who spent 9 hours in bed did not approach these levels of impairment, indicating that 9 hours in bed may be needed to alleviate the risk of performance errors.
Similar performance effects resulting from chronically restricted can also be seen in the study by Belenky et al. and in figure 3-3. This study involved 66 subjects who were observed in four conditions (i.e., 3, 5, 7 and 9 hours in bed) for 7 days. PVT testing showed severe impairments in reaction time under the 3-hour condition, with lapses in responses increasing steadily across the 7 days of sleep restriction. Subjects who spent 3 hours in bed reached levels of severe impairment at 5 days, while subjects who spent 5 hours in bed reached levels of impairment at 4 days.
These laboratory studies by Van Dongen et al. and Belenky et al. clearly show that subjects suffered performance impairments resulting from total sleep deprivation and/or chronic sleep restriction.
Cognitive impairments are present even after an individual has been awake for approximately 17 hours; in fact, recent studies have shown that these decrements are similar to those that result from an elevated blood alcohol level. A compelling laboratory study from Williamson and Feyer used a cross-over randomized control design to observe cognitive and motor performance after minor sleep deprivation to performance after alcohol consumption. All subjects participated in both alcohol consumption and sleep deprivation, and the order of testing was counterbalanced so that half of the subjects participated in the alcohol consumption part first while the other half participated in the sleep deprivation part first. To avoid carry-over effects from one condition to the next, subjects were provided with a night of rest in a motel between each condition.
Results indicate that, on average, performance with a blood alcohol level of 0.05% remained equivalent to performance after being awake for 1609 to 1806 hours. Performance with a blood alcohol level of 0.1% was equivalent to performance after being awake for 17.7 to 19.7 hours, or to restricted sleep of 4 to 5 hours per night for 1 week. Similar studies that compare performance after a time of sleep deprivation to performance with elevated blood alcohol level have confirmed these results. These findings are compelling as the duration of wakefulness (17 hours), which results in decrements that are similar to those that are induced by a 0.05% blood alcohol level, is considered by many to be within the range of a "normal" waking "day"; many individuals can recall an incident in which they had to waken early in the morning and work all day into the night. Astronauts, who sleep on average of 6 hours per night, may be performing critical tasks 17 hours or more after wakening.
Performance errors relative to sleep desynchronization and work overload.
Research suggests that circadian desynchronization and work overload may also impair performance. Specifically, a controlled laboratory study by Wright et al. evaluated the relationship between circadian rhythms and performance by assessing body temperature, which is regulated by the circadian mechanisms of the body. Body temperature is at its highest near the circadian peak and lowest near the circadian minimum (this is when the body is driven to sleep). It has long been recognized that a positive relationship exists between daily rhythms of the body temperature and neurobehavioral performance and alertness in humans.
The study protocol forced circadian desynchronization for 12 consecutive 28-hour days; participants were allowed 9.3 hours of scheduled time in bed and 18.7 hours of scheduled wakefulness. Performance on validated measures was evaluated ever 2 hours, beginning 2 hours after the scheduled wake time. The protocol, therefore, assessed performance when the body is normally driven to sleep (which is related to the point at which body temperature is at its lowest) relative to performance during normal waking hours, and allowed for assessment of the effects of body temperature independent of (and associated with) sleep hours and time of day. During the circadian peak ( when body temperature is high), performance and alertness are high; conversely, near the circadian phase of low body temperature, performance and alertness are low. These results have been replicated in other forced desynchrony and extended wakefulness laboratory protocols.
Results from these laboratory protocols can be extrapolated to field conditions. Studies in the medical industry, where highly educated and trained individuals (e.g., physicians) are subject to circadian shifting and extended work shifts in addition to sleep loss, further demonstrate serious performance errors with populations that are analogous to astronauts. In a two-session, with subject, experiment that was conducted by Arnedt et al., the performance of 34 medical interns was observed under four conditions:
Performance measures included the PVT and a simulated driving task. Findings of the Arnedt et al. experiment indicate that performance impairment after a heavy-call rotation is comparable to the impairment that is associated with a combined 0.04% to 0.05% blood alcohol level and a light-call rotation. Results of this experiment demonstrate that decrements that are created by extended work shifts are similar to the decrements that are created by elevated blood alcohol levels.
Work hours and sleep loss were shown to impact performance in a evaluation by Rogers et al. A total of 393 registered nurses logged scheduled hours worked, actual hours worked, time of day worked, overtime, days off, and sleep/wake patterns. Questions concerning errors and near-errors were also included. Analysis showed that work duration, overtime, and number of hours worked per week significantly affected the number of errors. The likelihood of making an error increased with longer work hours, and was three times higher when the nurses worked shifts lasting 12.5 hours or more. Working overtime increased the odds of making at least one error, regardless of the originally scheduled length of the shift. Working more than 40 and more than 50 hours per week significantly increased the risk of making an error.
Similar findings were attained in a subsequent evaluation of 2,737 medical interns. A Web-based survey was conducted across the U.S. in which interns completed 17,003 confidential monthly reports. These 60-item reports contained information concerning work hours, sleep, and activities during the month, number of days off, and the number of extended-duration work shifts (defined as at least 24 hours of continuous work). These interns were also asked to report whether they had made significant fatigue-related or non-fatigue-related medical errors. Other questions assessed how often they had nodded off or fallen asleep during patient care or educational activities.
Analysis revealed a significant relationship between the number of extended-duration work shifts and the reported rates of fatigue-related noteworthy medical errors. Specifically, the number of reported fatigue-related medical errors increased as the number of extended-duration shifts per month increased. At least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 3.8% of months with no extended-duration work shifts; and at least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 9.8% of months that had between one and four extended-duration work shifts and in 16% of months that had five or more extended-duration work shifts. Furthermore, the frequency of attentional failures was strongly associated with the frequency of extended-duration work shifts. Evidence from this study further corroborates the negative impact that extended-duration work shifts may have on performance, as well as increased accidents and injuries.
Working extended hours or overnight shifts also poses the added difficulty of requiring performance from an individual at a time with the body is driven to sleep by the circadian system. Sleep, alertness, and cognitive functioning are determined by the interaction of two processes: the endogenous circadian pacemaker and the homeostatic drive for sleep. The endogenous circadian pacemaker generates the 24-hour circadian rhythm that regulates subjective alertness and sleep propensity as well as core body temperature, cognitive functions, and melatonin secretion, as described above. It is also highly sensitive to light, which is its primary synchronization. Misalignment of the circadian rhythm results in disturbed sleep, impaired performance alertness, waking-hour melatonin secretion, and reduced levels of nocturnal secretion of growth hormone. The outcome, therefore, can range from performance error to long-term health decrements.
Individuals who work at night and attempt to sleep during the day suffer because the timing of their sleep/wake schedule remains out of phase with the timing of the environmental light. Night workers are particularly prone to vehicle accidents, and their decreased alertness, performance, and vigilance are likely to blame for a higher rate of industrial accidents and quality control errors on the job, injuries and a general decline in work productivity rate. Recent information also suggests that as the body normally releases melatonin when it is dark, working under artificial like at night suppresses the released of melatonin, which may increase the risk of developing cancer.
In summation, ground-based evidence demonstrates that sleep loss, circadian desynchronization, and extended work shifts lead to increased performance errors and accidents. The extent to which these risk factors are also present in the space flight environment is therefore an important consideration.

Christian Hülsmeyer

Christian Hülsmeyer (Huelsmeyer) (25 December 1881 – 31 January 1957) was a German inventor and entrepreneur. He is often credited with the invention of radar, but his apparatus, called the "Telemobiloscope," could not directly measure distance to a target and thus does not merit this full distinction. The Telemobiloscope was, however, the first patented device using radio waves for detecting the presence of distant objects.
Background.
Hülsmeyer was born at Eydelstedt, a village in Lower Saxony, Germany. He was the youngest of five children of Johann Heinrich Ernst Meyer and Elisabeth Wilhelmine Brenning. His birth name was Johann Christel, but after early childhood the name Christian was used. Following completion of the local "Volksschule" (elementary school), he attended "Grundschule" (primary school) in nearby Donstorf. A teacher there recognized his capabilities and, in 1896, assisted him in gaining admission to the "Lehrerseminare" (Teacher Training College) in Bremen. At the school, his major interest was in physics, and, after classroom hours, he was allowed to use the physics laboratory for his own experimenting. His interest was more with the potential applications of physics than with the academic side.
In June 1900, Hülsmeyer left college without completing his studies and obtained a job as an electrical trainee in the Siemens & Halske factory in Bremen. There he learned how concepts of devices were turned into commercial applications, intensifying his inventive nature. In April 1902, he left employment with Siemens to live with his brother Wilhelm in Düsseldorf and pursue his ideas for electrical and optical products. His brother initially funded him in setting up a shop where, a number of ideas were quickly turned into working items. These included a device (called a "Telephonogram") that telegraphed sounds; an electro-optical system for turning a truck into a mobile, multi-faced billboard; and a wireless apparatus for remotely igniting explosives. Within a year, he filed several patent applications on these and other inventions.
The Telemobiloscope.
In developing the wireless apparatus, Hülsmeyer read of Heinrich Hertz’s discovery that electromagnetic waves were reflected from metallic surfaces. He then turned his full attention to using the Hertz phenomenon in a system for preventing collisions between ships. Giving the name "Telemobiloskop" (Telemobiloscope) to the system, he made a patent application on 21 November 1903, and also advertised for a financial backer. Henry Mannheim, a leather merchant in Cologne, responded, and in March 1904, invested 2,000 Marks for 20 percent of future profits from the apparatus. The firm "Telemobiloskop–Gesellschaft Hülsmeyer & Mannheim" was opened the following May and officially registered in Cologne on 7 July 1904.
Hülsmeyer’s initial patent application for the Telemobiloscope was rejected, but a refiling, dated 30 April 1904, was accepted, resulting in Patent Publication DE 165546. An article on the system was published in a British technical magazine.
The Telemobiloscope was primarily a spark-gap transmitter connected to an array of dipole antennas, and a coherer receiver with a cylindrical parabolic antenna that could rotate 360 degrees. While the transmitted signal had a broad coverage, the receiving antenna was narrowly focused. When a reflected signal reached the receiver, a relay was actuated and, in turn, rang an electric bell. The basic patent description is as follows:
Hertzian-wave Projecting and Receiving Apparatus Adapted to Indicate or Give Warning of the Presence of a Metallic Body, such as Ships or Train, in the Line of Projecting of such Waves.
The system included a mechanism synchronizing the aiming direction of the receiving antenna with a compass-like indicator; it also included a means of rejecting false signals. Although the Telemobiloscope could not directly indicate range, a separate patent (DE 169154) was granted 2 April 1906, showing a method of using two vertical measurements and trigonometry to calculate approximate range. A relatively detailed description of the Telemobiloscope system, including a copy of the patent, is contained in a paper by Bauer.
The first public demonstration of the Telemobiloscope was in the courtyard of the Dom Hotel in Cologne on 17 May 1904. The metal gate to the courtyard was the target, and the transmission path was through a curtain – showing that the apparatus could work when the target could not be seen. The demonstration was reported widely in newspapers, one giving a detailed description.
A conference was held in June 1904, at Scheveningen, the Netherlands, involving the major shipping firms of the region; ship safety was a major topic. After learning of the demonstration at the Dom Hotel, the head of the "Holland-Amerika Lijn" (HAL) invited "Telemobiloskop-Gesellschaft" to provide a demonstration of their apparatus during the conference. This demonstration took place on 9 June during a tour through the harbor at Rotterdam aboard the ship-tender "Columbus". The Minutes of the conference (contained in the HAL Archives in the Municipal Archives of Rotterdam) include the following description of the demonstration: 
Newspapers carried articles about the demonstration, all giving praise to the new maritime safety invention. One of these closed the article with the following: “Because, above and under water metal objects reflect waves, this invention might have significance for future warfare.” 
The building of the Telemobiloscope and its demonstrations had depleted the initial funds of the "Telemobiloskop–Gesellschaft" firm. On 12 August 1904, rights to the system were sold to Trading Company "Z.H. Gumpel daselbst" of Hannover. The sales agreement, to which Heinrich Mannheim was a signer, said that Hülsmeyer would be given up to 5,000 Marks for future research, and 45 percent of net profits from future sales. It noted that the previous agreement with Mannheim was then obsolete, and after Hülsmeyer has provided proof of the usefulness of his invention, the Gumpel Company would establish a Consortium to commercialize the invention. It also noted that If the Telemobiloscope rights were in turn sold by Gumpel, the sales price would have to exceed 1,000,000 Marks.
Improvements were made on the equipment, particularly in extending the operational distance. Patent applications on the Telemobiloscope were filed in a number of countries. The application in Great Britain was granted in only 10 weeks, but most of the others were either withdrawn, rejected, or not processed because fees were not paid. 
A request was made to Holland-America to allow a demonstration at sea; this was apparently turned down but another demonstration was given near the Hook of Holland in the autumn of 1904. A second conference of the shipping firms was held in London in June 1905; the Conference Minutes include the following: 
With the distribution of these Minutes in the European shipping community, the prospect of the Telemobiloscope as a viable product ended. There have been many explanations as to the failure; these mainly cite either poor equipment design or the competition of Marconi. The Telemobiloscope design used wireless technology of the late 1890s, and did not include tuning circuits for frequency selection. By 1904, there were many wireless sets aboard ships and at shore stations, and, without tuning capability, these could not be rejected and thus interfered with the Telemobiloscope operation. As to competition, Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Company dominated Europe and had agreements with essentially all shipping firms prohibiting their use of anything except Marconi equipment. 
The Official Registry in Cologne shows that the "Telemobiloskop–Gesellschaft Hülsmeyer & Mannheim" firm was dissolved 5 October 1905. Also, the agreement with Gumpel to establish a Consortium for commercializing the invention would no longer be applicable.
Post-Telemobiloscope activities.
In 1904, while still heavily engaged with the Telemobiloscope, Hülsmeyer filed for a patent (DE180009) on a machine for diameter reduction of metallic rods and tubes, and in 1906, established a firm supplying equipment for producing incandescent lamps. This was followed in 1907 by his forming the company "Kessel-und Apparatebau Christian Hülsmeyer" (Boilers and Apparatus Construction) in Düsseldorf; in 1910, he bought a factory site at Düsseldorf-Flingern for the firm. For many years, this company built steam and water apparatus, high-pressure gauges, and anti-rust-filters (trade named “Rostex”). The company continued to operate until 1953. Altogether in his career, Hülsmeyer developed and patented some 180 inventions; these and his various businesses ultimately brought him financial success.
Although there is controversy about his inventing radar, Christian Hülsmeyer is still held in high esteem in Germany. In January 1982, Professor K. Mauel gave a lecture at the Organization of German Engineers Center in Düsseldorf on Radar History, celebrating the centenary of Hülsmeyer’s birth. At the 2002 EUSAR Conference in Cologne, the keynote speech was "Hülsmeyer – The Inventor of Radar."
During a radar conference held in Frankfurt in 1953, Hülsmeyer and Robert Watson-Watt were honored guests. (Watson-Watt had been a leader of radar technology development in Great Britain, and received a patent on the system in 1935). In a discussion with Hülsmeyer as to who was the rightful inventor of this technology, it is said that Watson-Watt ended the discussion by remarking, “I am the father of radar, whereas you are its grandfather.”
On 29 October 1910, Christian Hülsmeyer married Luise Petersen of Bremen. Between 1911 and 1924, they had six children. One of these, a daughter named Annelise Hülsmeyer-Hecker, maintained collection of documents related to her father, and was a source of much that has been written concerning him. She was also instrumental in collecting items, including components of the Telemobiloscope, that are now displayed in the "Deutsches Museum Munic". Upon his death in Ahrweiler on 31 Jan. 1957, Christian Hülsmeyer was buried in the North Cemetery at Düsseldorf.

Richard Segrave

Richard Segrave (c.1540-1598) was an Irish judge, remembered chiefly for sitting in judgement on his colleague Nicholas Nugent, the only Irish judge to be hanged by the Irish Government for treason.
He was the son of Patrick Segrave (died 1552) head of the prominent landowning family of Killegland, now Ashbourne, County Meath; the Richard Sydgrave who was Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer 1423-5, was a member of the same family, if not a direct ancestor. His date of birth is not recorded but he was still a minor when his father died. He entered Grays Inn in 1560.
In 1578 he became second Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) on the suspension of Nicholas Nugent. This in itself caused comment when in 1582 Segrave was one of three judges called on to sit on a special commission at Trim, County Meath, to try Nugent, who had been restored to favour as Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, but was now charged with complicity in the rebellion of his nephew William Nugent. The trial gave rise to deep disquiet, due partly to the failure of the Crown to produce two witnesses, as normally required in a treason trial, and partly due to the perceived bias of the judges, especially Sir Robert Dillon, a lifelong enemy of Nugent. Whether Segrave had any personal bias against Nugent is not known, but he had profited by his disgrace, and Segrave's son married Dillon's daughter; further, contrary to the modern principle of judicial impartiality, it was said that the judges were chosen for their personal knowledge of Nugent. It was also said that pressure was pit on the jury to convict, although this was also quite usual in English treason trials. Nugent was found guilty and hanged, but the affair caused such unease that it was later suggested that only English-born judges should sit in Irish Courts as Irish judges were not capable of doing justice.
He died in 1598 and was buried at Ashbourne. He married twice and was the father of Patrick Segrave, who like his father became a Baron of the Exchequer but was later removed for corruption.

NBR A class

The NBR A Class (London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) Classes N14 and N15 were the standard 0-6-2 tank locomotives designed by Matthew Holmes for freight duties on the North British Railway. The LNER regarded the original locomotives as two separate classes (N14 & N15. The final batch of locomotives was on order at the time of the grouping in 1923.
History.
N14 Class.
The original six locomotive introduced in 1909 and had inside cylinders and piston valves operated by Stephenson valve gear, and weighed . They were built by the North British Locomotive Company and numbered 858-863. They were withdrawn 1947-1954.
N15/1 Class.
Fifty three similar locomotives were built by the North British Locomotive Company between June 1910 March 1917 with longer cabs but shorter bunkers. They were fitted with Steam brakes and used on Freight duties. A further batch of ten locomotives was built by North British Locomotive Company in February and March 1920. A third batch of ten was on order from Robert Stephenson and Company when the North British Railway became a constituent of the LNER. They were delivered between January and March 1923. They weighed and were numbered to fill gaps in the sequence between 20 and 926. Two of these locomotives were later fitted with Westinghouse brakes in 1929 and were re-classified N15/2. The remainder were withdrawn between 1957 and 1962. .
N15/2 Class.
Six N15/1 locomotives were built by the North British Locomotive Company with Westinghouse brakes in 1910 nkers. They were used to bank passenger trains up the 1 in 42 Cowlairs incline leading from Glasgow Queen Street railway station. Prior to 1910 trains had been roped hauled by a stationary engine. A further two N15/1 were converted to N15/2 in 1929. They weighed and were numbered to fill gaps in the sequence between 7 and 282 and were withdrawn between 1957 and 1962. .

Emilio Cruz

Emilio Antonio Cruz (15 March 1938 – 10 December 2004) was an African-American artist of Cuban descent who lived for most of his life in New York City.
His work is held in several major museums in the United States.
Biography.
Emilio Antonio Cruz was an African American of Cuban descent.
He was born in the Bronx on 15 March 1938. He studied at the Art Students League and The New School in New York, then at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, and finally at the Seong Moy School of Painting and Graphic Arts in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
As a young artist in the 1960s, Cruz was connected with other artists who were applying abstract expressionism concepts to figurative art such as Lester Johnson, Bob Thompson and Jan Muller. He combined human and animal figures with imagery from archaeology and natural history to create disturbing, dreamlike paintings. 
Cruz received a John Jay Whitney Fellowship and awards from the Joan Mitchell Foundation and from the National Endowment for the Arts.
Cruz moved to Chicago and taught at the Art Institute of Chicago during the 1970s. 
He wrote two plays, "Homeostasis: Once More the Scorpion" and "The Absence Held Fast to Its Presence".
These were first performed at the Open Eye Theater in New York in 1981, and later were included in the World Theater Festival in Nancy and Paris, France, and in Italy.
In 1982 he returned to New York where he began to exhibit again.
In the late 1980s he resumed teaching, and at the time of his death was an assistant professor at the Pratt Institute and at New York University.
Emilio Antonio Cruz died from pancreatic cancer on 10 December 2004 at St. Vincent's Hospital, aged 66.
Work and reception.
Harry Rand, Curator of 20th Century Painting and Sculpture at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, described Emilio Cruz as one of the important pioneers of American Modernism of the 1960s for his fusion of Abstract Expressionism with figuration. 
Geno Rodriquez, Curator and Executive Director of The Alternative Museum wrote in 1985, "Emilio Cruz, is a brilliant and impassioned artist whose current paintings are monumental, imbued with intelligence, fury and an apt sense of irony. They reflect the turbulent world within which we live."
Geoffrey Jacques wrote in 1990, "Emilio Cruz paints humanity’s essence. Mythology and archeology are the foremost concerns of the painter Emilio Cruz. Dinosaurs, skeletal humans and fossil-like images are used in his work as metaphoric signposts in a consideration of the basic questions of existence."
Art historian and curator Paul Staiti wrote in 1997, "Emilio Cruz's Homo sapiens series is a strange and haunting genealogy of the modern soul... What is at stake here more than biopolitical culture, is the remystification of the body and mapping of consciousness ... For all the trauma, explicit and implicit, Cruz's style is masterful, classical, even beautiful."
Exhibitions.
Cruz held his first solo exhibition at the Zabriskie Gallery in New York in 1963.
After this his work was included in many group and solo exhibitions, including museum exhibitions at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 1987, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1997.
In 1994, Cruz's work was shown as part of the American contingent at the IV Bienal Internacional de Pintura en Cuenca, Ecuador. Other American artists exhibiting at this show were Donald Locke, Philemona Williamson, Whitfield Lovell and Freddy Rodríguez. 
His last show was "I Am Food I Eat the Eater of Food" at the Alitash Kebede Gallery in Los Angeles in 2004.
Cruz's work is held in many collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C., the Albright–Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York, and the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut.

USCGC Point Glass (WPB-82336)

USCGC "Point Glass" (WPB-82336) was an Point class cutter constructed at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1962 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1962 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as "WPB-82336" when commissioned and acquired the name "Point Glass" in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .
Construction and design details.
"Point Glass" was built to accommodate an 8 man crew. She was powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment. 
The design specifications for "Point Glass" included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.
History.
"Point Glass" was stationed at Tacoma, Washington, from 1962 to 1970 and was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. While moored at Tacoma she was rammed by the Canadian tug "Marpole" on 26 May 1965 sustaining damage. After 1971 she was homeported at Gig Harbor, Washington.
In 1990 she was transferred to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During the morning hours of 17 April 1992 "Point Glass" assisted the disabled MV "G.H. Vanderburgh" which was floundering in breaking surf and in danger of grounding on a coral reef six miles southwest of Fowey Rocks Light near Miami, Florida. "Point Glass" successfully navigated 34 miles through 8–10 foot seas to the distressed vessel and determined that she had crossed over the outer reef line and was about to damage the environmentally sensitive coral reef at Biscayne National Park. After passing a line to "G.H. Vanderburgh", she towed her to safety, thereby saving the coral reef from damage and preventing harm to the seven man crew of the vessel. For these actions, the "Point Glass" and her crew were awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation with Operational Distinguishing Device. In 1998, "Point Glass" and her crew were awarded the Coast Guard Meritorious Team Commendation with the Operational Distinguishing Device for participating in the Shell Air/Sea show at Fort Lauderdale by being part of the task force enforcing a 3 square mile safety zone near the event and showing the audience a search and rescue demonstration as well as a high speed patrol boat pass.
"Point Glass" was decommissioned on 3 April 2000 and ownership was transferred to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for use at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary where she served as NOAA Research Vessel "Point Glass" until sold to Point Glass LLC in 2006. The vessel is now used to support the Sea Scout program, part of the Boy Scouts of America, in order to teach navigation and seamanship skills.

Leberknödel

Leberknödel is a traditional dish of German, Austrian and Czech cuisines.
Leberknödel are usually composed of beef liver, though in the German Palatinate region pork is used instead. The meat is ground and mixed with bread, eggs, parsley and various spices, often nutmeg or marjoram. In Austria spleen is often mixed with the liver in a 1/3 ratio. 
Using 2 moistened tablespoons, the batter is formed into dumplings and boiled in beef broth or fried in lard.
Due to their looser consistency, the boiled dumplings are meant to be eaten fresh after preparation, although the fried variant are somewhat less perishable due to the crust formed by frying.
In the Palatinate, Leberknödel are often served with Sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. In Bavaria and Austria they are usually served in soup as "Leberknödelsuppe" (Liver dumpling soup).

Leeds Municipal election, 1972

The final Leeds municipal elections were held on 5 May 1972, with a third of the councillors up for re-election. The wide-reaching reforms set out in the Local Government Act 1972 had timetabled the council's abolishment to coincide with the replacing of it by the enlarged successor Leeds metropolitan district on 1 April 1974. Prior to the election, a by-election had resulted in Labour gaining the seat in Castleton from the Liberals. 
Labour repeated all of last year's gains, with the exceptions of the Castleton and Osmondthorpe seats - both of which they already held; the latter being their solitary gain in the 1969 election. Much like Labour's performance in the 1969 election, the Conservatives halted their decline - at least in vote share (like Labour, their total vote actually sunk a further 5,000, setting a new party low). Having won full representation in West Hunslet, the Liberals defended the seat and retained their total of four. Turnout fell slightly to 34.4%, from 37.8% the year before. 
The reaction from the Labour leader, Albert King, was one of contentment: ""This is a satisfactory evening for us, and the gains were more or less in line with what I expected"". The Conservatives meanwhile were reported to be relieved, with their leader Frank Marshall commenting that the results were better than expected a couple of months ago, and pointing to a significantly reduced Labour vote in Burley from the year before as a reason for optimism for the future.
The sixteen gains for Labour were enough to re-take control of the council from the Conservatives for its last years of existence.
Election result.
The result had the following consequences for the total number of seats on the Council after the elections:

Their headquarters is near Seattle in neighboring Bremerton, Washington. SAFE Boats International manufactures vessels for military, law enforcement, fire and rescue, and other agencies. SAFE Boats also provides training program to their customers in driving and maintaining the boats. SAFE Boats International was founded in 1997 by Scott Peterson and William Hansen. Since 1997 SAFE Boats has further expanded to three factory locations in the Port of Bremerton's Olympic View Industrial Park. Their motto is "God, Country and Fast Boats." It is contracted by the General Services Administration (GSA) for procurement by U.S. Federal and Government agencies. The current CEO and President is Scott Peterson.
Notable Clients.
There are over 1,600 boats currently in service by organizations in over 50 countries around the world.
In 2008 the Mexican Navy signed a US$12 million contract for six 33-foot craft, and plans to acquire 30 or more in the next two or three years. In June 2009 the Iraqi Navy acquired 26 of the 25-foot "Defender" class craft for US$8.4 million. They will be deployed to the Iraqi port Umm Qasr and will secure critical infrastructure; including the Khor al Amaya(Khawr al ‘Amīyah) and al Başrah Oil Terminals in the Persian Gulf.
In 2012 Gibraltar purchased two 13 m response boats from SAFE Boats International for the Royal Gibraltar Police's role in combating the rise in drug trafficking in the Strait of Gibraltar. The RGP Commissioner, Mr. Yome was quoted as saying "These are very high-powered vessels and they give us a further capability out at sea, they also provide more protection for our officers." Media reports linked the purchases with a need to combat increased drug smuggling across the Straits of Gibraltar.
United States government.
On February 5, 2011, SAFE Boats International won a U.S. Government contract worth over $180,611,987.33 to provide 470 Response Boat-Small (RB-S) boats to U.S. Coast Guard shore units in order to perform law enforcement missions. It will also include 20 boats for Customs and Border Protection and 10 boats for the U.S. Navy, for a total of 500 boats.
In May 2012 the US Navy announced that SBI beat out two competitors to win a US$30 million contract to build five 78-foot MK VI Patrol Boats with an option for a sixth boat for another US$6million. Ultimately the US Navy plans to purchase 48 MK VI Patrol Boats. The MK VI Patrol Boats are based upon SBI's 780 "Archangel"-class patrol boat and the new vessels will be the Navy's next generation of patrol boats. They will have the capability to be transported and launched from large-deck LPH LHA and LHD amphibious assault ships. SAFE Boats International stated that the contract would allow them to hire 100 new employees alongside the existing 275 employees. A few months later in July 2012, SAFE Boats International was selected to build the U.S. Coast Guard’s new Cutter Boat-Over the Horizon-IV (CB-OTH-IV). SAFE boats will build over 100 CB-OTH-IV vessels over a seven-year period with delivery starting in 2013. The SAFE Boats CB-OTH-IV vessel was selected over three other competitors' vessels.
Earmarks.
In the summer of 2010 an article was published by "The Seattle Times" claiming that former aides of Patty Murray, the senior United States Senator from Washington, were benefiting from earmarks added to defense appropriations bills. Murray added US$57 million in earmarks to the 2011 defense appropriation bill, of which $19.5 million went to clients of her former aides who now work as lobbyists. According to the article, SAFE Boats International paid lobbying firm Denny Miller Associates US$300,000 in lobbying fees and in 2008 received $6million in an earmark sponsored by U.S. Rep Norman D. Dicks, D-Bremerton. SAFE Boats CEO Scott Peterson said that the 2011 earmark would allow for 15 or more people a year to be hired.

Peter Proksch

Peter Proksch (4 February 1935 – 9 Dezember 2012) was an Austrian artist.
Born in Vienna, he was the eldest of four children. The father Alfred Proksch was a commercial artist, the mother was a model. The profession of the father, obviously stimulated his talent and the interest in drawing very early, even if this, in the years of war, seldom, if ever, could be with his family. Also because of the war, the family left Vienna to live in the country until the end of war.
Education and Training.
Returned to Vienna in 1945, he attended secondary school. From 1950 to 1955 he studied graphic design at the Graphische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt, Vienna, where he graduated obtaining the masters diploma. As he took a minor interest in the profession of a graphic designer, he continues, studying painting, at the Academy of fine arts in Vienna, at first at the masters class of R.C.Anderen where from he soon changes to the masters class of Sergius Pauser.
There he had the possibility to learn the classical technique of the old masters. After an other year of studying at the class of Chr.L.Martin (artistic printing methods) to learn the art of etching, he completed his studies in 1962. That year, he exhibited some etchings for the first time. The first personal exhibition followed in 1963. It was not a great success, but the results were contacts to galleries, art dealers, collectors and subsequently, possibilities to exhibit all over the world. Today Peter Proksch is known as one of the most famous representatives of the Viennese Fantastic Art. Exhibitions in Paris, Rome, Turin, Munich, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Basel, Vaduz, Tokyo, New York, Tel Aviv, Caracas and last but not least in Vienna, made his work recognized all over the world and you can find them in many public and private collections."

Human rights in Togo

Togo, a small, poor country in West Africa that was labeled “Not Free” by Freedom House from 1972 to 1998, and again from 2002 to 2006, and that has been categorized as “Partly Free” from 1999 to 2001 and again from 2007 to the present, has very serious and longstanding human-rights problems. According to a U.S. State Department report based on conditions in 2010, they include “security force use of excessive force, including torture, which resulted in deaths and injuries; official impunity; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrests and detention; lengthy pretrial detention; executive influence over the judiciary; infringement of citizens' privacy rights; restrictions on freedoms of press, assembly, and movement; official corruption; discrimination and violence against women; child abuse, including female genital mutilation (FGM), and sexual exploitation of children; regional and ethnic discrimination; trafficking in persons, especially women and children; societal discrimination against persons with disabilities; official and societal discrimination against homosexual persons; societal discrimination against persons with HIV; and forced labor, including by children.”
Historical background.
Togo, once a German protectorate, and later a French possession, won independence in 1960 and has been criticized for its human-rights record ever since. Military leader Gnassingbe Eyadema took power in 1967; despite the legalization of political parties in 1991 and the ratification of a democratic constitution in 1992, the regime continued to be regarded as oppressive, and in 1993 the EU cut off aid in reaction to the regime's human-rights offenses. After's Eyadema death in 2005 his son, Faure Gnassingbe, took over, then stood down and was elected in elections that were widely described as having been fixed and which occasioned violence that resulted in as many as 500 deaths and the flight from Togo of 40,000 refugees. 
The following is a chart of Togo's ratings since 1972 in the Freedom in the World reports, published annually by Freedom House. A rating of 1 is "free"; 7, "not free".
Basic rights.
Togo's constitution and laws forbid discrimination “based on race, gender, religion, disability, language, or social status,” but these prohibitions are not adequately enforced. Although Togo's constitution and laws guarantee freedom of speech and of the press, there are considerable restrictions on those rights, with many journalists being fined or sued for defamation, and some engaging in self-censorship to avoid lawsuits or violent reprisals. Libel fines can be as high as 5 million CFA francs (USD 10,000), and the number of libel cases and convictions, especially involving statements about the president and his family, peaked in 2010. In 2011, journalists formed “SOS Journalists in Danger” after several of them were named in an anonymous note, supposedly from the government, which threatened torture and physical abuse.
According to a 2012 report by Freedom House, the size of Togo's private media sector “is impressive for a relatively small country, and its content is often highly politicized. There are approximately 30 privately owned newspapers that publish with some regularity, including 2 dailies, about 100 private radio stations...and 8 independent television stations.” Print media do not require official licenses, but “ervasive impunity for crimes against journalists has created an illiberal media environment marked by self-censorship that persisted during the tense election year of 2010 and only improved marginally in 2011.” 
The High Authority of Audiovisuals and Communications (HAAC) is supposed to be an independent agency that protects freedom of the press, in fact it censors the media on behalf of the government, and has the power to suspend newspapers for six months and to confiscate journalists' press cards and equipment. Also, radio stations cannot retransmit foreign programs without HAAC approval. Still, much of the press is very critical of the government, while government-owned media are heavily biased in its favor. Although the private media has grown in the last decade or so, the government still owns the media outlets with the largest audiences, including the only nationwide TV station.
In 2012, the HAAC suspended the call-in shows on Légende FM, an order that was backed up by a magistrate in Lomé. The station's news director, Guy Mario, said that it “was being punished for its shows in June in which callers had criticized the violent crackdown by security forces on anti-government protests in Lomé...Mario said that the programs, which ran for nine days, featured participants criticizing the government in uncensored language.” The station was not given the chance to defend itself in court, which is contrary to Togolese law. “We were never informed, invited, or summoned to the tribunal – neither us nor our lawyers,” Mario said. 
During the 2010 presidential election campaign, French journalists were denied accreditation until election day; the situation on this front improved in 2011. 
There are no restrictions on, or monitoring of, Internet use. A security force is maintained at the University of Lome to intimidate academics, and undercover government informants attend classes. While Togo's constitution and laws guarantee freedom of assembly, it is generally restricted, with the government preventing meetings of its opponents and using force, including deadly force, to disperse anti-government demonstrations. Likewise, though Togo technically guarantees the right to move freely around the country, travel abroad, emigrate, and repatriate, these rights are also restricted in practice, with armed forces manning checkpoints around the country at which they arbitrarily search travelers and demand bribes. 
In May 2012 a law was passed requiring prior notification of public demonstrations. In the same year, security forces used excessive force to disperse a number of demonstrators, and the head of the ANC was subjected to house arrest to keep him from taking part in protests. Student activists connected to the Mouvement pour l’épanouissement des étudiants togolais (Movement for the development of Togolese students, MEET) were arrested, wounded by rubber bullets, and generally abused. 
Corruption is a crime, but is rarely punished. Â«According to the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators for 2009, government corruption was a severe problem. Corruption was common among prison officials, police officers, and members of the judiciary.Â» The 2005 presidential election was rife with fraud, intimidation, and violence, but the 2010 election was relatively peaceful and was considered generally free and fair.
The opposition began holding protests in April demanding electoral reforms, calling for an end to the Gnassingbé dynasty, and insisting on respect for human rights. Government security forces brutally put down several demonstrations in mid 2012. In October 2012, a sociology student described the situation as “very worrying,” noting that the opposition “is hardening its stance and the government doesn’t seem to be listening.” A former economy and finance minister said at the same time that the Togolese people “are angry about the government’s slip-ups in terms of human rights, acting arbitrarily and using the judiciary to cling to power.” 
In Togo, where 33 percent of the population is animist, 28 percent Catholic, 14 percent Sunni Muslim, and 10 percent Protestant, and where both Christian and Muslim holy days are national holidays, there have been no reports in recent years of abuses of religious freedom or of discrimination based on religious affiliation. Members of different religions regularly invite one another to worship services, according to a 2012 U.S. State Department report on religious freedom, which also notes that religious intermarriage is common.
Human-rights groups.
Human-rights groups in Togo include the Togolese League of Human Rights, the Center for Observation and Promotion of the Rule of Law, and the Togolese Association for the Defense and Protection of Human Rights. Although these groups, as well as many of their international counterparts, are allowed to operate in Togo, the government usually pays no heed to their recommendations. The national assembly also has a human-rights committee, but it plays a minimal role.
Women's rights.
Rape is widespread and is a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison, sometimes 20 years, for example in cases of child rape or gang rape. Victims tend not to report rapes owing to stigma and fear of reprisal. Spousal rape is not a crime, nor is domestic violence, although it is also widespread. Police tend not to get involved in domestic abuse, the government has no official program to address it, and women are unaware of their rights in such situations. Sexual harassment is also widespread, and though it is technically illegal the law against it is not enforced. 
Families have the right to plan children as they wish. Under the law women are equal, but they suffer social and official discrimination on a variety of fronts, thanks to the enforcement of traditional laws. 
For example, husbands have the right to tell their wives not to work and have control over the money they earn. Although legally women are entitled to equal pay, this law is not respected in most sectors. Women can own property, but are not entitled to child support or any other payments if they divorce and do not have a right to inherit their husbands' property. Polygamy is common. It is the job of the Ministry of Social Action and National Solidarity to ensure that women know what their rights are.
Children's rights.
Children born in Togo or to Togolese fathers automatically become citizens of Togo. In cases where the father is unknown or is stateless, children inherit their mothers' citizenship. Children are required to attend school until age 15, but parents must pay for books and cover other expenses. Child abuse is common, and the law against child sexual exploitation and child prostitution is not well-enforced. Statutory rape is not illegal. There is a degree of child marriage, especially among Muslims. A 2007 law guarantees a wide range of protections for children, and in 2009 the government set up a toll-free line to report child abuse. But the government does little to help orphans and other children in need. Togo is not a signatory of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. 
Female genital mutilation has been illegal since 1998, but the law is rarely enforced. According to the U.S. State Department, in 2010 the procedure was performed on about 6 percent of girls. A 2012 report by the German Federal Office for Migration and Asylum noted that the “abolition” of FGM “was officially announced and celebrated at a national ceremony in Sokodé on 29 and 30 December 2012.” Thanks in part to a German NGO that has run nationwide information campaigns about FGM, and actively sought to help FGM practitioners find other work, “there has been a continual decline in female genital mutilation.” The German report puts the rate of FGM in girls under 14 at 0.7 percent in 2008 and, contrary to the U.S. State Department report, at 0.4 percent in 2010.” In 2012 it was believed to be even lower. 
According to a 2012 U.S. State Department report on trafficking, “Togo is a source and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking...Near the Togo-Burkina Faso border, Togolese boys are forced into begging by corrupt marabouts (religious instructors). Togolese girls and, to a lesser extent, boys are transported to Benin, Gabon, Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and subsequently forced to work in agriculture. Children from Benin and Ghana are recruited and transported to Togo for forced labor. Traffickers exploit Togolese men for forced labor in Nigerian agriculture and Togolese women as domestic servants. Some reports indicate Togolese women are fraudulently recruited for employment in Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Europe, where they are subsequently subjected to domestic servitude or forced prostitution.” The Togo government is not doing much to prevent these crimes, but it is trying to do more than it used to. Still, the U.S. State Department issued a long list of recommendations for improvements in legislation, enforcement, prosecution, and prevention.
Disabled people's rights.
Discrimination against people with disabilities is illegal but this law is not well-enforced. Nor is the requiring the government to aid disabled people. Although there is no explicit government discrimination against disabled persons, but societal discrimination exists. There is no law requiring that public buildings be wheelchair-accessible. There is an Agency for Handicapped Persons that runs awareness campaigns, offers job training, and distributes food and clothing.
LGBT rights.
Homosexual acts are punishable by up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of about USD 1,000. There is also widespread antigay prejudice.
HIV/AIDS rights.
Discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS is illegal, but is widespread.
Employees' rights.
Workers have the right to join unions, and most have the right to strike and bargain collectively, within certain limitations. Anti-union discrimination, forced labor and child labor are illegal, but these laws are not well enforced. Many children work as beggars, servants, farm laborers, and at other jobs, the most dangerous being in quarries, with some of them essentially being slaves, while many women are forced to work as prostitutes or domestics. Although employing children under 15 is illegal, some children as young as five years old are in employment. The Ministry of Social Action and National Solidarity is supposed to enforce the law against child labor, but enforcement is weak. There are minimum wages for various types of work, but they are very low and unenforced. There are also laws restricting work hours and the like, but these tend to be ignored and unforced.
According to a 2012 report by the U.S. Department of Labor, “Togo made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor” in 2011, with local child labor committees expanding their efforts “by tracking the return of trafficking victims and improved coordination by
sharing information with government officials during the reporting period.” Also, Togo's government cooperates with “donor-funded projects to combat the worst forms of child labor and operates a hotline to report child abuse.” Still, Togo has yet to devote “sufficient resources to enforce its child labor
laws effectively” and minors “continue to work in dangerous conditions.”
Rights of refugees and asylum-seekers.
Togo works with international organizations to aid refugees, asylum seekers, and others. Although its laws do not provide for granting asylum or refugee status, the government has set up a system for providing such persons. As of 2010 several hundred refugees from Ghana were living in Togo.
Rights of persons under arrest.
Police beat suspects during interrogation, routinely and with impunity. Even children are in danger of being beaten in such situations. Although arbitrary arrest and detention are against the law and constitution, they occur nonetheless. As a rule, the police are ineffective and corrupt, and routinely get away with abuses. While a variety of public officials are empowered to issue arrest warrants, persons are still often arrested without warrants and detained secretly. Although the law stipulates that persons in detention have the right to be told of the charges against them and forbids detention without charges for more than 48 (or, sometimes, 96) hours, these rules are often ignored. Political opponents of the government are often arrested arbitrarily. Debtors are also often arrested, also this too is against the law.
Rights of persons on trial.
In 2007, victims of abuse during the 2005 elections had to pay a sum to the court in exchange for having their cases moved forward. Some of those who paid did not get anything in return. Owing partly to a shortage of judges and other qualified judicial officials, defendants are often kept in pretrial detention for long periods, which sometimes are longer than the terms they would have been sentenced to if put on trial and found guilty. Also, there is considerable judicial corruption, with the executive branch exerting influence over judges, and lawyers bribing judges. Judges who support the ruling party are given higher positions than those who support an independent judiciary. There is no presumption of innocence; there is trial by jury; trials are open. Defendants have the right to an attorney, and are provided with one if they cannot afford to pay. This and other rights are generally respected in practice, but defendants' right to see government evidence is not. In rural villages, chiefs or elders are empowered to try minor cases. 
A young British human-rights volunteer in Togo describes attending a trial at which he was pressed into service as a translator.
Rights of persons in prison.
Prison guards beat inmates, also routinely and with impunity. Prisons are overcrowded and unsanitary, with unsatisfactory food and medical care; sick prisoners must pay guards in order to receive treatment in the infirmary, and also pay fees to shower, use toilet facilities, or have a cot. Sexual harassment of female inmates is common. Prisoners are allowed to see visitors and practice their religions. They are also allowed to file complaints, but authorities generally do nothing in response. Investigations of prison conditions are rare, although groups like the Red Cross are allowed to inspect prison facilities. The Ministry of Justice is purportedly administrating a long-term prison reform program, the Urgent Prison Support Program, funded by the EU, but it has changed little. In June 2010, Togo abolished the death penalty, and all persons who had been sentenced to death had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. 
A 2012 report by Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN) said that “Togo's 12 prisons - many of them dilapidated - hold more than twice their designed capacity. The congestion, as well as inadequate food, medical care and poor hygiene have led to diseases and deaths.” Most of the inmates are people awaiting trial, half of whom have not been charged. The report quoted one prisoner as saying: “We sleep very close to one another, with our heads on someone else’s feet, like sardines in a tin. At night we sleep in shifts, while some lie down, the others stand against the wall waiting impatiently for their turn.” The watchdog group Atlas of Torture ranked Togo the world's fourth worst country when it came to the number of detainees waiting to be tried. IRIN also noted that some persons who are ordered by the courts to be released continue to be held in prison.

Teddybear Airdrop Minsk 2012

Teddybear Airdrop Minsk 2012 was an aerial event that took place over Belarus on July 4, 2012. On that day an airplane, chartered by the Swedish advertising agency Studio Total, illegally entered the Belarusian airspace and parachuted several hundred teddy bears with notes carrying pro-democracy messages. After denying for three weeks that the incident ever took place and calling the footage of the airdrop released by Studio Total a hoax, the Belarus government finally acknowledged on July 26, 2012, that the teddy bear airdrop did happen. The event greatly angered the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, who viewed it as a significant national security failure. Lukashenko sacked two top generals, the heads of Belarus’ border guards and of Air Defense, for failing to intercept the Studio Total plane. The airdrop led to an escalating diplomatic crisis in relations between Belarus and Sweden. On August 3, 2012, Belarus expelled the Swedish Ambassador and subsequently ordered the remaining staff of the Swedish embassy to leave Belarus by the end of the month. Belarus also withdrew its ambassador and all of its embassy staff from Sweden.
The airdrop.
On July 4, 2012, a small airplane, chartered by the Swedish advertising agency Studio Total and with two people on board, took off from an airfield in Lithuania and illegally entered the Belarus airspace, crossing the Belarusian border from Lithuania. The plane dropped several hundred teddy bears, carrying cards and notes with pro-democracy, pro-freedom of speech and protest messages, over the Belarusian town of Ivyanets, near Minsk. The organizers of the airdrop originally planned to drop some of the teddy bears over state government buildings in Minsk, but uncertainties over the fuel supply and also the fact that the plane had been contacted by the Belarusian air traffic controllers resulted in a decision to drop the bears over Ivyanets and then head back. The plane crossed back over the border into Lithuania without encountering any interference from the Belarusian military. Per Cromwell, the founder of Studio Total, was in a car on the ground in Ivyanets during the airdrop.
Various newsreports put the total number of teddy bears dropped at around 800. 
The airdrop operation was dubbed "Teddybear Airdrop Minsk 2012" by its Studio Total organizers.
One of the pilots of the Studio Total plane involved in the airdrop, Tomas Mazetti, stated that the idea to use teddy bears came from Belarusian pro-democracy activists, who had been arrested on many occasions by the authorities and started carrying teddy bears with protest slogans demanding freedom of speech. The teddy bears were regularly confiscated by the police and the Studio Total airdrop was intended as a solidarity gesture: "we flew in teddy bears and airdropped them to support those arrested teddy bears". Studio Total maintains that no Belarusian democracy activists were involved in planning the teddy bear airdrop. According to Mazetti, the flight inside Belarusian airspace lasted for about an hour and a half, at the altitude of about 50 meters, or 150 feet.
The two people on board the teddy bear flight, Tomas Mazetti and Hannah Frey, spent about a year preparing for the airdrop operation. Their preparations included buying a three-seater Jodel plane and learning to pilot it, spending the equivalent of about US$184,500 in the process.
Reaction by Belarus.
After the airdrop Studio Total released several short video-clips of the operation. A number of videos, made by Belarusians who observed the drop, of parachuting teddy bears were posted on YouTube and went viral. However, the initial reaction both by the Swedish media and by the Belarusian state media, to the Studio Total claims of the airdrop, was skeptical.
Initial official denials.
The Belarusian authorities initially issued stringent denials that the teddy bear airdrop ever occurred and that there was any unauthorized intrusion of the Belarus air space on July 4. Belarusian government officials claimed that the Studio Total video of the drop was fake and characterized it as a "hoax" designed to embarrass the Belarus government. About a week after the drop Studio Total released about 90 minutes of raw unedited video-footage taken during the July 4 flight. Radio Free Europe examined the footage and concluded that it appeared to be authentic.
Nevertheless, the Belurasian government continued to deny that the airdrop happened.
Arrests of journalists.
On July 13, authorities in Belarus arrested a 20-year-old student journalist, Anton Suryapin, who posted on his website, Bnp.by, some of the first photos related to the teddy bear airdrop.
Suryapin wrote on his website that he was e-mailed the photos by one of the local residents who observed the drop. Several days prior to Suryapin's arrest, the police in Minsk arrested a realtor, Syarhei Basharimau, who had rented an apartment in the capital to two Swedes connected with Studio Total. 
Representatives of Studio Total claim that neither Suryapin nor Basharimau were in any way involved in planning and conducting the airdrop and called for their release. Several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International also called for Suryapin's release. Both Suryapin and Basharimau, who have been formally charged, were released on bail on August 17, 2012 and face up to seven years imprisonment.
In early August 2012 two journalists, Irina Kozlik and Yulia Doroshkevich, who took photos of teddy bears in solidarity with Suryapin and Basharimau, were arrested in Minsk and then convicted of "violating the law on protests" and fined the equivalent of several hundred U.S. dollars.
July 26 acknowledgement.
After three weeks of denials by the Belarusian authorities that the event actually occurred, on July 26, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko finally acknowledged that the July 4 teddy bear airdrop did take place.
Sacking of Belarusian military officials.
President Lukashenko was reported to have been greatly angered by the teddy bear airdrop and by the failure of the Belarusian military to intercept it, which he viewed as a significant national security lapse. He indicated that those officials responsible for this lapse will be disciplined: "This plane was discovered in time, but why did the (air defense) authorities not intercept the flight? ... Come on lads. We are all grown up. The guilty ones have to answer for this."
On Tuesday, July 31, 2012, the Belarusian government announced that President Lukashenko had sacked two top generals, the air defense chief Dmitry Pakhmelkin, and the head of the border guards Igor Rachkovsky "for not properly carrying out their duties in safeguarding Belarussian national security."
President Lukashenko instructed the new border guards chief to shoot down any future illegal intruders of the Belarusian airspace: "Unlawful violations of state borders must not be allowed. They must be stopped by all force and means, including weapons, regardless of anything."
Subsequent government actions.
On August 11 the Belarus KGB issued summons to the three Swedish organizers of the airdrop, Tomas Mazetti, Hannah Frey and Per Cromwell, to come to Belarus for questioning about the operation within 10 days. The summons were posted on the Belarus KGB website and delivered to Studio Total by e-mail and stated that failure to comply could result in "correctional work for up to two years, or imprisonment for up to six months." Studio Total refused to comply with the summons and instead offered to discuss the airdrop operation directly with President Lukashenko if he visits Sweden.
Belarus also sent an official request to the government of Lithuania for help "to investigate a possible breach of the state border when a Swedish-piloted light aircraft crossed the Lithuanian-Belarus border." President Lukashenko was quoted by Interfax saying that "Lithuania should not be sitting like mice under a broom. They must answer to us why they provided their territory for national border violation. If there is anyone who won't find it funny, it is Lithuania".
Diplomatic row with Sweden.
On August 3 Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt announced that Belarus had "expelled" the Swedish ambassador to Belarus Stefan Eriksson who had been on vacation in Sweden at the time when informed that he would not be allowed back to Belarus. The Belarus government disputed Sweden's characterization of events, stating: "The Belarusian side did not expel the Swedish ambassador. The decision was made not to extend his accreditation." Belarus justified its decision by saying that the Swedish ambassador's "activities were aimed not at the strengthening of relations between Belarus and Sweden, but on their erosion.”
In response the Swedish government announced that the incoming Belarusian ambassador to Sweden would not be allowed into the country and that two other Belarusian diplomats were being expelled.
Subsequently Belarus ordered all the remaining Swedish diplomatic staff to leave Belarus by August 30. Belarus also announced that all of its embassy staff in Sweden are being recalled, but that "it was not severing diplomatic ties with Stockholm."
The European Union held an urgent meeting of its diplomats on Friday, August 10, 2012, in Brussels to discuss the EU response to the escalating row between Belarus and Sweden. The EU diplomats expressed strong support for Sweden in the dispute but took no concrete action against Belarus.
Earlier reports indicated that the meeting was expected to result in a mass recall of the EU ambassadors in Belarus to their home countries.

<doc id="36677934" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36677934" title="Overpass Light Brigade">
Overpass Light Brigade

Overpass Light Brigade (OLB) is an activist collaborative public art project initiated by American artists Lane Hall and Lisa Moline, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The artwork is an episodic performance originally created as part of the 2011 Wisconsin protests to raise awareness about the campaign to recall Governor Scott Walker.
Description.
The artwork consists of a series of LED-illuminated Coroplast panels each held by a different person. Individual panels display one letter of the alphabet each. Performers, known as "holders of the light," assemble in a line with each person holding one sign/letter. Together, the Overpass Light Brigade presents a political slogan. The slogans typically relate to current events in local politics. The Overpass Light Brigade performs at night to increase visibility. Members typically make arrangements for performances via the social media platforms Twitter and Facebook.
Hall manufactures the panels in his shop. He describes his process on the "Daily Kos" blog to encourage others to use the group's tactics. Hall and Moline collaborate to create photographs and videos documenting Overpass Light Brigade performances. Public school teacher and founder of Occupy Riverwest, Joe Brusky joined Hall and Moline in March, 2011, to help with social media and the live-streaming of bridge actions.
The Overpass Light Brigade organizes its nighttime demonstrations on bridges and highway overpasses. It also mobilizes members to participate in political rallies and vigils. More recent actions have included collaboration with national labor advocates regarding Walmart's labor practices, the Chicago Teacher's Union (CTU) Strike, as well as environmental advocacy with organizations such as 350.org. In addition to overpasses, appearances have also have included picketing with striking Palermo's Pizza workers, a pedestrian bridge to the Milwaukee Art Museum, an event with Nuns on the Bus, and vigils mourning the 2012 Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting.
History.
Hall and Moline developed the idea for the Overpass Light Brigade through their personal reactions to the movement to recall Governor Walker. Hall originally used a single panel and string of Christmas lights to create an illuminated "Recall Walker" sign, which he carried at a local rally. When images of the sign were circulated by mainstream media outlets ranging from "The Rachel Maddow Show" to CNN, Hall and Moline decided to continue their efforts. Their next step was to create six individual signs that spelled RECALL. After attempting to install the signs on the chainlink fence covering a pedestrian bridge across the Interstate and learning that this is illegal, Hall and Moline enlisted others to help carry the signs, a legal form of display. This participatory dimension to the work gives Overpass Light Brigade gatherings "the feel of a celebration, with scores of people gathering on the pedestrian overpasses," according the "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel". 
For the artists, their work with the Overpass Light Brigade is a "demonstration of citizen engagement...a Situationist paradigm of performativity within the contested and liminal zones of public space" and a navigation of the tactics of visibility. They cite French critical theorist Guy Debord's "The Society of the Spectacle" as an inspiration. Debord explored and explained how contemporary media creates spectacle that is essentially devoid of content. A founder of the artistic and political movement Situationist International, he sought, through the construction of "situations," to create multiple strategies for reclaiming an individual's self-determination from the sedative effects of ubiquitous spectacle.
Hall and Moline had a history of making collaborative work, often about environmental issues and animal subjects, but rarely pushed beyond the boundaries of traditional art spaces. As a result of the Wisconsin Protests, the artists became involved with activist work, in which the use of signs was pivotal. They also worked with other artists, activists, social scientists, and teachers to set up a political action committee called The Playground Legends and began working within some of Milwaukee's African American communities on voter education and Get Out The Vote campaigns. The group, with the central notion that public space and public discourse were necessary for functional democracy, set up "parties in the parks" for neighborhood groups, and used these relational activities to help create cohesion around a political purpose.
Growth.
Additional and affiliated OLB organizations have been established across the United States in the states of Maryland, Florida, Hawaii, California, Texas, and Oregon, including San Diego, Austin, Tampa, Portland and Gainesville, among other cities. A short documentary film by filmmakers Matt Mullins and Dusan Harminc, titled Overpass Light Brigade, is currently under production. It is scheduled to be released on May 2, 2013, in Milwaukee, WI.

Sarah Morduck

Sarah Morduck was an Englishwoman accused of being a malevolent witch in 1701. When she was acquitted in court, the man who had originally accused her of the crime, a blacksmith's apprentice named Richard Hathaway, was charged with making false claims.
Morduck's case subsequently became "cited frequently" by historians studying the English witch trials, in particular to highlight both judicial skepticism toward witchcraft and the continued popular belief in it. The first in-depth historical examination of the case was produced by William Renwick Riddell in an academic paper published in 1928. The first reassessment of the historical sources pertaining to the trial was produced by Lara Apps in an academic paper of hers published in the journal "Preternature".
Morduck lived for several years after the ordeal, dying in early 1713; she was buried on 8 January 1713 in the churchyard of Saint Benet and Saint Peter, Paul's Wharf.

Fires (Ronan Keating album)

Fires is the ninth studio album by Irish singer Ronan Keating. The album was released on 3 September, with a special deluxe, signed edition to be available from the Universal Music official store. It is his fifth album to contain original material and his first in six years following "Bring You Home".
Background.
The release of the album was confirmed in January 2012, during an interview with "The Sun", in which Ronan said: "Now I have a new lease of life, and I'm ready to write and record, I'm working on a new studio album, which I hope to release later this year, it will feature brand new songs". "It's not folk. It's a mix! It's a pop album. Gregg Alexander and I are working together again. It's got that 'Life is a Rollercoaster' feel again. I'm having fun with it again, it's been five years since I've done a studio album. I'm a little bit nervous, I just want to make a great record, for me, rather than for anyone else."
Promotion.
To promote the record, Keating embarked on a short promotional tour, which began on 3 August 2012, with the Summarfestivalur in The Faroe Islands, where he performed in front of 14,000 fans. Other dates included the Þjóðhátíð festival in Iceland on 5 August, and the Festas do Mar in Portugal on 17 August in front of 20,000 fans, as well as appearances in Germany and Australia. Ronan undertook two weeks of radio promotion around radio stations in the last week of August. He will perform 'Fires' on Red or Black? on 8 September 2012
A full arena tour in promotion of the album will commence on 16 January 2013, and will cover select areas of the United Kingdom and Ireland. Venues include Colston Hall in Bristol, The O2 Arena, Cardiff International Arena, Brighton Centre, Nottingham Royal Concert Hall, LG Arena in Birmingham, Bournemouth International Centre, Sheffield City Hall, Blackpool Opera House, Liverpool Echo Arena, Manchester Apollo, Newcastle City Hall, Clyde Auditorium and AECC in Scotland and The O2 in Ireland.
Critical reception.
On 22 August 2012 the album was voted album of the week by BBC Radio 2.
"Fires" received positive reviews from BBC Music, critic Mike Driver declared that "a few bloopers aside, this is probably Keating’s best album since his eponymous debut."
The Daily Express gave the album a rating of 4 out of 5 and commented that "it's on songs such as Love You And Leave You that you get a whiff of a truly original artist."
Commercial Performance.
The album charted in Ireland at number 12, in the UK at number 5 selling 30,000 copies, and in Germany at number 20, selling 14,000 copies.

Human rights in Tanzania

The issue of Human rights in Tanzania, a nation with a population of 44,928,923 in 2012, is complex. In its 2013 Freedom in the World report, Freedom House declared the country "Partly Free".
Human rights concerns.
The United Nations Human Rights Council in October 2011 at its meeting in Geneva completed a Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the human rights situation in Tanzania. At this UPR, the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and several countries addressed various problems in Tanzania.
Gender equality.
The UNCT said,
National reviews and assessments of equality between men and women ... have identified a range of challenges ..., which continue to prevail. These include the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women; inequalities in arrangements for productive activities and in access to resources; inequalities in the sharing of power and decision-making; lack of respect for and inadequate promotion and protection of the human rights of women; and inequalities in managing natural resources and safeguarding the environment. ... Particular attention should be drawn to the widespread marginalization of the girl child in different spheres of life, including education, and the total exclusion caused for many by early and forced marriage. ... Gender-based violence is prevalent. According to a 2005 World Health Organization survey, 41 percent of ever-partnered women in Dar es Salaam have experienced physical or sexual violence at the hands of a partner.
Tanzania expressed support for Denmark's recommendation to, "Put in place a comprehensive strategy and effective legislation to eliminate practices that discriminate against women... Tanzania also supported Ghana's recommendation to, "Put in place a comprehensive strategy ... to modify or eliminate cultural practices and stereotypes that discriminate against women...
Indigenous peoples.
The UNCT said,
The rights of indigenous peoples to access ancestral lands have been denied or limited for economic exploitation, in particular in game reserves. ... he Government would be urged to reconsider its policy by which the notion of indigenous peoples is unrecognized and to take steps to ensure their right to practice their own culture in parity with the majority population. The Government should also consider developing human rights based standard operating procedures for evictions, clearly setting it out as a matter of last resort to resolve disputes over land use between public interests, private investors and pastoralists.
During the UPR, Finland noted the forceful and unlawful evictions of indigenous people. It also asked Tanzania about its actions to implement the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and whether the government would take legislative measures to effectively protect the rights of indigenous peoples. Denmark was concerned by the denial or curtailing of indigenous people's rights to ancestral lands, resulting in numerous forced evictions.
Same-sex relations.
The UNCT said,
Homosexuality is considered contrary to cultural norms; same sex sexual relations are criminalized. Group arrests in connection to peaceful assemblies, non-attendance to HIV patients, as well as forcible evictions of persons due to their sexual orientation by local and religious communities have been reported. Moreover, representatives of the groups and other human rights defenders may not be willing to make public statements in favor of tolerance and decriminalization for fear of reprisals. The Government is urged to take a proactive stance ... and repeal any criminal provision against persons based on their sexual orientation.
During the UPR, Sweden noted that the "criminalization of sexual minorities contributed to the stigmatization and vulnerability of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons". Slovenia expressed concern that consensual same-sex sexual acts remained criminalized.
Workplace discrimination.
The UNCT said,
Although the Convention on Equal Remuneration ... and the Convention on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation ... have been ratified and domestic laws to their effect have been introduced, the Government has yet to elaborate measures to address wage discrimination and disparities between job values in the private and public sectors. ... espite the Government having put in place the HIV/AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2008 and the Employment and Labour Relations (Code of Good Practice) Rules 2007, HIV/AIDS related discrimination remains institutionalized in the workplace in both the public and private spheres.
Commercial sex workers.
The UNCT said,
Commercial sex workers are another group at risk of social exclusion and harsh treatment by law enforcement. Considered as an offence under applicable criminal law, commercial sex continues to fuel harassment and abuse. The Government is encouraged to study the effects of the arrests of these workers, the majority of whom are women.
Albinism.
The killing and mutilation of people that suffer from albinism continues. Some witch doctors believe the witchcraft to be more powerful if the victim screams during an amputation. Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in March 2013 that prosecutions for these crimes are rarely successful with only five known cases of convictions out of the 72 murders of people with albinism documented in Tanzania since 2000.
The UNCT said,
From 2006 to 2010, at least 58 persons with albinism were killed, the majority of whom were children. In addition, there were nine cases of attempted murder and reports of the desecration of graves. ... Efforts have been made to prosecute the murderers. Tackling the national and international trade in body parts is also essential to ending the killings. In terms of protection, the Government has established special shelter centers for children with albinism. However, in the long-term, this measure results in the children's isolation from society and separation from family. Therefore, the Government should explore alternative ways of protecting people with albinism, including options that promote social inclusion and tolerance.
Maternal mortality.
The UNCT said,
Maternal health outcomes have shown slow improvement over the past two decades. ... n important recommendation is that the Government increase access to and availability of basic emergency obstetric care services, skilled health workers – currently attending less than 50 percent of live births – as well as supplies. Access to family planning could reduce maternal deaths by a third and child death by as much as 20 percent. ... Also needed is a consideration of the current restrictiveness of safe abortion services, which, under the Penal Code, is considered as illegal. Reports suggest that this restrictiveness costs the lives of many women and girls seeking to conduct the act secretly, without professional guidance and under unhygienic conditions.
Under-five child mortality.
The UNCT said,
After more than a decade of stagnation during the 1980s and 1990s, major gains in child survival have been reported since mid-2000. ... This progress is equivalent to saving nearly 100,000 children every year. ... Nonetheless, the toll of under-five deaths still amounts to roughly 155,000 deaths per year – more than 400 deaths in Tanzania every day.
Forced labor.
The UNCT said,
The Local Government (District Authorities) Act (1982) allows the Government to compel individuals and groups to forcibly work for purposes of economic development. A number of laws also permit the imposition of forced or compulsory labor as a punishment for a range of offenses, including the expression of political views and the failure to engage in socially useful work. ... These provisions are incompatible with relevant Labor Organization conventions and the Government should revise these provisions as a matter of priority.
Trafficking in persons.
The UNCT said,
Tanzania is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking, specifically under conditions of forced labor and forced prostitution. The incidence of internal trafficking is higher than that of transnational trafficking, largely from rural to urban areas, affecting primarily children for their exploitation in domestic servitude, petty trade and prostitution. Family members and friends who offer assistance with education or lucrative employment in urban areas usually facilitate trafficking. The use of young girls for forced domestic labor continues to be the country‟s largest human trafficking problem. Due to the lack of establishment of an Anti-Trafficking Committee, the governmental agencies tasked with prevention and protection are unable to implement the 2008 Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act as there are no regulations for them to follow. Thus, most government officials remain unfamiliar with the Act's provisions and no budgetary resources allocated to combating the crime and assisting the victims have been secured... Law enforcement officials often fail to see human trafficking as a crime but rather a moral issue that can be remedied by financial compensation. ... From the enactment of the law to the end of January 2011, three cases were successfully prosecuted...
Incarceration, prisons, and access to justice.
The UNCT said,
There is an acute shortage of courts, as well as judges and magistrates to preside over cases, severely affecting access to competent tribunals. Pointedly, percent of ... cases ... in the primary and district courts ... have been pending for 2 years or more. Likewise, the number of cases pending in the High Court (for murder, serious offences and appeals) is rising due to fewer court sittings. In addition, justice is further delayed by prolonged investigations by the police, the courts' adjourning of cases on the basis of flimsy technical grounds and the non-appearance of witnesses. There is also a dearth of lawyers who are qualified to provide representation in court, the great majority of whom are based in Dar es Salaam. ... While the law allows for legal aid in criminal cases, those accused of murder and treason are provided with free representation in practice only. Detention facilities struggle to cater for the basic needs of the ever-growing number of inmates, most of whom are remandees. Convicted and unconvinced are mixed together, often under inhumane conditions. Some prisons are housing more than twice their capacity, as is the case with the Ruanda Central Prison, which has a capacity of 400 prisoners and holds 838.
In its 2012 human rights report, the United States State Department said,
Despite some improvements[,] prison conditions remained harsh and life-threatening. Inadequate food, overcrowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate medical care were pervasive. There were allegations that authorities engaged in inhumane treatment. Serious threats to life continued in detention centers. ... As of December[,] the prisons held 33,338 inmates--13 percent above the total capacity of 29,552. Among the prisoners, 15,584 were convicts (47 percent) and the remaining 17,554 were pretrial detainees (53 percent). Pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners were held together. ... In July[,] the minister of state in ... reported that jails [there ... held 2,260 pretrial detainees, of whom 110 were women. According to an October 2011 prison report by the Tanganyika Law Society ... due to overcrowding, three male prisoners often had to share two mattresses. ... According to government officials, there were 52 deaths due to HIV/AIDS in prisons from January to December 2012. The most common health complaints were malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other diseases related to poor sanitation. Prison dispensaries offered only limited treatment, and friends and family members of prisoners generally had to provide medications or the funds to purchase them. ... Limited transportation also affected the ability of prison staff to take prisoners to health clinics and hospitals. ... Recordkeeping in prisons was inadequate and resulted in discrepancies in reporting. On the mainland[,] the law allows judges and magistrates to grant parole or impose alternative sentences such as community service ..., but these options were rarely used. The law authorizes early release for good behavior but has burdensome evidentiary requirements. On the mainland[,] authorities often moved prisoners to different prisons without notifying their families. ... The number of probation officers remained inadequate. ... On the mainland[,] prisoners were permitted to submit complaints to judicial authorities, but it was alleged that the letters were censored.
Detainees charged with criminal matters generally waited three to four years for trial due to a lack of judges to hear cases, an inadequate judicial budget, and the lengthy time required to complete police investigations.
Juvenile justice.
The UNCT said,
Children are routinely held pre- and post-trial in adult detention centers even in regions in which juvenile detention centers exist. The prisons are not staffed or equipped to provide specialist services, and although generally under-18s or under-21s are separated at night, they mix with adults during the day. There are only two post detention centers and five retention homes (with two more opening in the near future) for under-18s in the country. There is no separate criminal system for under-18s and, apart from one juvenile court in Dar Es Salaam, juvenile cases are heard in regular courts. Under-18s without the means to pay for a lawyer are often left without legal assistance. There is no system of diversion and no community rehabilitation schemes provided for by law, or implemented in practice. Non-custodial sentencing is limited. Boys may receive corporal punishment or stroking. Other punishments relate to fines, compensation or costs and probation with supervision. Zanzibar equally lacks a separate system for children and, with no separate detention centers, under-18s are mixed with adults in the prison.
In its 2012 human rights report, the United States State Department said,
The for Human Rights and Good Governance ... visited a sampling of prisons and detention facilities in 2011 and found that there were 441 children detained in the adult prisons visited. Among these, 64 (15 percent) were convicted, and the remaining 377 (85 percent) were pretrial detainees. ... There was one prison for children in the Mbeya Region and five remand homes across the country. Officials attributed the shortage to a lack of coordination between the judiciary, police, and prison department.
Excessive use of force, torture, arbitrary arrests, and corruption.
During the UPR, the United States expressed concern about reports of arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force by police and the military, and corruption in law enforcement. Denmark was concerned by reports of law enforcement officers engaging in disproportionate use of force, including torture.
Tanzania expressed support for the U.S. recommendations to, "Implement a national action plan to combat corruption, including enhanced laws and enforcement, more resources dedicated to anti-corruption bodies, a review of law enforcement compensation, and a nation-wide educational campaign..." and to provide human rights training to security forces.
In its 2012 human rights report, the United States State Department said,
During the year[,] there were numerous reports that agents of the government (specifically police and other security units) committed unlawful killings. Nongovernmental organizations ... and local news agencies documented several cases of police officers mistreating, beating, and causing the deaths of civilians. ... The Legal and Human Rights Center (LHRC) announced that police brutality, domestic violence, and extrajudicial killings rose during ... Although authorities often arrested police officers implicated in deaths and injuries when their involvement came to the attention of the inspector general of police, such cases progressed slowly in court, and convictions were infrequent. The LHRC reported in October that no police officer or other official security personnel had been convicted for extrajudicial killing of civilians since 2002.
The constitution and law prohibit ... and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, but there were reports that police officers, prison guards, and soldiers who abused, threatened, and otherwise mistreated civilians, suspected criminals, and prisoners faced limited accountability. The abuse most commonly involved beatings. ... The law allows caning. Local government officials and courts occasionally used caning as a punishment for both juvenile and adult offenders.
Tanzanian Police Force ... has primary responsibility for maintaining law and order both on the mainland and in Zanzibar. ... Throughout ... [2012, there were reports of excessive force, police corruption, and impunity. Low pay contributed to perceived corruption in certain units, as reported widely by citizens and the press. Newspaper articles, civil complaints, and reports of police corruption from the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau ... and Ministry of Home Affairs also continued. ... Sungusungu, or citizens' patrols, are traditional neighborhood anticrime groups that exist throughout the mainland. The People's Militia Act of 1973 grants them the power to make arrests. ... Sungusungu members ... carry sticks or clubs. ... At times Sungusungu patrols beat and even killed criminal suspects before turning them over to police. ... Mainland police sometimes acted as prosecutors in lower courts, which allowed police to manipulate evidence in criminal cases.
On the mainland[,] the law ... requires that a person arrested for a crime, other than a national security detainee, be charged before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest, but police failed to comply consistently with this requirement. The law gives accused persons the right to contact a lawyer or talk with family members, but at times they were denied this right. Prompt access to counsel was often limited by the lack of lawyers in rural areas, lack of communication systems and infrastructure, and illiteracy and poverty of the accused. ... The government provided legal representation for some indigent defendants and for all suspects charged with murder or treason. ... In the primary and district courts, bribes sometimes determined whether or not bail was granted.
Justice for survivors of gender based violence.
The UNCT said,
Survivors of sexual abuse and violence, struggle to secure justice and social support. The vast majority of police, prosecutors and magistrates are not trained to meet the needs of survivors. Many officers recommend out of court settlements. Stigma and community pressure often dissuades families from lodging cases, with the community preferring that the case is handled outside the justice system. This often leads to impunity for perpetrators. Since 2008, a system is emerging to improve the reception of survivors and responses to their needs. ... However, continued training and skills-development, in conjunction with awareness raising initiatives, is necessary... For instance, ... only 320 officers of the 35,000-strong police force have received training.
Freedom of association, opinion and expression.
The UNCT said,
By virtue of commitments made in MKUKUTA II, more efforts to increase access to independent information are underway. Therein, an expansion from the current twelve community medias to at least one community media in each district is forecast. To deliver on that commitment, it will be necessary to alleviate the lengthy and bureaucratic procedures in licensing such radio stations, which may take between one to three years. The Government should further be concerned about reports from the independent 2010 general election monitors, which point to instances of intimidation against these radio stations as a means to hinder broadcasting voters' education programmes. Another important recommendation for the Government would be the fast-tracking of freedom of information legislation; code of ethics for advertisements; and the introduction of public broadcasting in Zanzibar.
Treatment of school pupils.
The UNCT said,
In 2008, only 0.4 percent of children with disabilities were enrolled and the trend is decreasing. In most cases these children attend special needs schools rather than enjoying inclusive education. While the Government has developed an Inclusive Education Strategy, immediate efforts should be taken to ensure its implementation and hence increase the inclusion of orphans and other vulnerable children, many of whom are likely to be among the 5 percent of primary age children missing in schools. A 2002 regulation allows for the expulsion of pregnant girls from school. Existing protection and special programs for girls are inadequate and result in many girls being unable to fulfill the compulsory education program in place in the country. Corporal punishment is not prohibited in any environment, including in schools, and its use is widespread. Preliminary results from a forthcoming study on violence against children records high levels of physical violence in school. Over 50 percent of children have been subjected to physical violence – being punched, kicked, slapped, whipped or threatened with a weapon – by their teachers before the age of 18.
During the UPR, Finland commented on Tanzania's restrictions about the education of persons with disabilities and asked the government about its actions to fully implement the act on persons with disabilities and the strategy on inclusive education.
Persons living with HIV/AIDS.
The UNCT said,
Stereotyping in HIV/AIDS infection has continued fueling stigma and discrimination, particularly against women due to gender norms that label women as "vectors" of transmission for HIV. ... Another contributor to the stigmatization of HIV or AIDS affected individuals is the criminalization of "intentional" transmission of HIV/AIDS, with punishment of up to ten years. As it is difficult to find out who, among adults, has knowingly infected another person, the added value of this approach is questioned. In addition, with mother to child transmission it raises an additional concern for women.
Zanzibar.
Historically, the human rights situation on Zanzibar has been more problematic than the situation on the mainland. The original constitution of the united republic have gave mainland authorities almost no recourse to intervene in matters of law and justice. Mainland officials were thus powerless to stop a wave of arbitrary arrests and imprisonments on the islands. The Zanzibar branch of the Revolutionary Party has historically been significantly more authoritarian than its mainland counterpart, a situation that has remained the case even after opposition parties were legalized in 1992.
Refugees from Burundi.
After a February 2012 meeting among Tanzania, Burundi, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the decision was made to close the Mtabila camp – home to approximately 38,000 Burundian refugees – on 31 December 2012. Tanzania refused to grant citizenship to any of these refugees after having done so for 162,000 Burundian refugees in 2010.
Following a detailed questionnaire conducted by UNHCR and Tanzanian officials in December 2011, 33,708 refugees in Mtabila were found to be "not in need of international protection" and those who "are unwilling, without justifiable grounds, to return to Burundi, will find themselves liable to be dealt with under relevant Tanzanian laws, including those for immigration control and management". In August 2012, on the basis of screening interviews conducted with UNHCR, only 2,715 of the refugees were determined to remain entitled to refugee status. In November 2012, the UNHCR reported that around 1,000 people per day were being assisted to voluntarily return to Burundi.

Amalaka

An Amalaka, is a stone disk, usually with ridges on the rim, that sits atop a temple's main tower (Sikhara). According to one interpretation, the amalaka represents a lotus, and thus the symbolic seat for the deity below. Another interpretation is that it symbolizes the sun, and is thus the gateway to the heavenly world.
According other sources, the shape of the amalaka has been inspired by the fruit of the myrobolan fig tree Phyllanthus emblica (ou Mirobalanus embilica).
The amalaka itself is crowned with a kalasam (finial), from which a temple banner is often hung.

G-expectation

In probability theory, the g-expectation is a nonlinear expectation based on a backwards stochastic differential equation (BSDE) originally developed by Shige Peng.
Definition.
Given a probability space formula_1 with formula_2 is a ("d"-dimensional) Wiener process (on that space). Given the filtration generated by formula_3, i.e. formula_4, let formula_5 be formula_6 measurable. Consider the BSDE given by:
Then the g-expectation for formula_5 is given by formula_9. Note that if formula_5 is an "m"-dimensional vector, then formula_11 (for each time formula_12) is an "m"-dimensional vector and formula_13 is an formula_14 matrix.
In fact the conditional expectation is given by formula_15 and much like the formal definition for conditional expectation it follows that formula_16 for any formula_17 (and the formula_18 function is the indicator function).
Existence and uniqueness.
Let formula_19 satisfy:
Then for any random variable formula_32 there exists a unique pair of formula_21-adapted processes formula_34 which satisfy the stochastic differential equation.
In particular, if formula_26 additionally satisfies:
then for the terminal random variable formula_32 it follows that the solution processes formula_34 are square integrable. Therefore formula_42 is square integrable for all times formula_12.

Sahibi River

The Sahibi River is an ephemeral, rain-fed river in India. It is variously called the Sabi River or Sabi Nadi ("nadi" means "river" in Hindi). In Delhi, it is called the Najafgarh Drain or Najafgarh Nallah.
Geography.
The Sahibi River rises in the Aravali Hills, near Jitgarh, Manoharpur, and the district of Jaipur in Rajasthan. After gathering volume from a hundred tributaries, the Sahibi River forms a broad stream around Alwar and Kotputli. It then enters the Rewari district in Haryana, near the city of Rewari, after which it re-enters first Rajasthan near Kot Kasim, and then Haryana, near the village of Jarthal. The dry riverbed near Jarthal is two kilometers wide. During light monsoon rainfall, the river's flat and sandy bottom absorbs all rainwater. During heavy rains, the river branches off into two smaller streams at Rohtak, finally reaching the outskirts of Delhi through Nala No. 8 and ending at the Yamuna River.
Catchment area.
The catchment area of the Sahibi River is 4442 square kilometers. The catchment area encompasses the following cities and towns: Sikar, Jaipur, and Alwar in northeastern Rajasthan; Bawal, Rewari, Patoudi, and Gurgaon, in Haryana; and Delhi.
Within Delhi.
The Najafgarh Drain or Najafgarh Nallah ("nallah" in Hindi means "drain") is another name for the Sahibi River, which continues its flow through Delhi where it is channelised for flood control purposes. It is a tributary to the Yamuna River, into which it flows. The Najafgarh Drain gets its name from the once famous and huge Najafgarh Lake near the town of Najafgarh in southwest Delhi. The Najafgarh Drain is the capital’s most polluted body of water due to the direct inflow of untreated sewage from surrounding populated areas. Assessing the water quality of wetlands in wildlife habitats, a January 2005 report by the Central Pollution Control Board rated the Najafgarh Drain under category D, along with 13 other highly polluted wetlands.
Regulators at the Keshopur Bus Depot on the Outer Ring Road are wide with thick and high embankments. A vast amount of water is retained in this widened drain by closing the Kakrola regulators under Najafgarh Road to recharge the local groundwater table.
History.
Prior to 1960, the rain-fed Sahibi River entered Delhi near Dhansa and spilled its overflow in the Najafgarh Jheel basin, creating a seasonal lake. A vast area more than 300 sqyare kilometers was submerged in some seasons. In the following decades, the Sahibi River flow reaching Dhansa was channelised by digging a wide drain and connecting it directly to the Yamuna River, completely draining the seasonal Najafgarh Jheel.
The Sahibi River flooded in 1977. In response, the Masani Barrage was constructed near Masani. Several smaller dams have also been constructed throughout the hills of Rajasthan to store rainwater. The construction of dams has restricted the flow of water on the Sahibi River and it is now rare for water overflow from monsoon rains to reach up the Masani Barrage.
Archaeological findings.
Archaeological findings on the Sahibi River have confirmed habitations on its banks before the Harappan and pre-Mahabharata periods. Both handmade and wheel-made earthernware dated from 3309–2709 BCE and 2879–2384 BCE has been found on the banks of the Sahibi River at Jodhpura. INTACH-Rewari found pottery on the Sahibi riverbed at Hansaka in the Rewari district. A red stone statue of Vamana Dev was found in the Sahibi riverbed near Bawal in 2002; the statue is now displayed at the Shri Krishna Museum, Kurukshetra. Other artifacts discovered in the Sahibi River include arrowheads, fishhooks, appearheads, awls, and chisels.
The Sahibi River has been identified by the Brahmavarta Research Foundation as the Drishadwati River of the Vedic period. The Drishadwati River formed one border of the Vedic state of Brahmavarta and was mentioned in the "Rigveda", the "Manusmriti", and the "Brahmin Granths" texts.
Bridges.
Several bridges cross the Sahibi River. A bridge on State Highway No. 14 crosses the river between Bansur and Kotputli. On State Highway No. 52, a bridge crosses the river between Ajaraka and Dadhiya. The Masani Bridge on NH-8 crosses the river between Deli and Jaipur. A railroad bridge between Ajaraka and Bawal also crosses the river.

Human rights in Sierra Leone

Human rights in Sierra Leone are in a rather deplorable state, but have improved gradually since the end of its civil war in 2002. Among the major human-rights problems in Sierra Leone today, according to a 2011 U.S. State Department report, are “security force abuse and use of excessive force with detainees, including juveniles; harsh conditions in prisons and jails; official impunity; arbitrary arrest and detention; prolonged detention, excessive bail, and insufficient legal representation; interference with freedom of speech and press; forcible dispersion of demonstrators; widespread official corruption; societal discrimination and violence against women, discrimination based on sexual orientation; female genital mutilation (FGM); child abuse; trafficking in persons, including children; and forced and child labor.” 
Sierra Leone has acceded to or ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or
Punishment, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. 
In September 2011, Sierra Leone's First UPR Report was adopted by the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva. Of the 129 recommendations made by the review committee on 5 May 2011, the government of Sierra Leone noted that it had already implemented 57. 
In November 2012, Sierra Leone was elected to the U.N. Human Rights Council.
Historical background.
A 2001 overview noted that there had been “serious and grotesque human rights violations” in Sierra Leone since its civil war began in 1991.The rebels, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), had “committed horrendous abuses,” including rape and the amputation of limbs. The report noted that “25 times as many people” had already been killed in Sierra Leone than had been killed in Kosovo at the point when the international community decided to take action. “In fact, it has been pointed out by many that the atrocities in Sierra Leone have been worse than was seen in Kosovo.” 
Crimes committed during the war “included severing limbs, forcibly recruiting children into armed groups, widespread rape and coercion of women and girls as 'bush wives' of combatants, burning houses, and killing and maiming of civilians. More than 200,000 people are estimated to have been killed, and hundreds of thousands more were displaced across the country.” 
About one quarter of the soldiers serving in the government armed forces during the civil war were under age 18. “Recruitment methods were brutal – sometimes children were abducted, sometimes they were forced to kill members of their own families so as to make them outcasts, sometimes they were drugged, sometimes they were forced into conscription by threatening family members.” Child soldiers were deliberately overwhelmed with violence “in order to completely desensitize them and make them mindless killing machines.” 
Sierra Leone's civil war ended in January 2002 after the U.N. established a large peacekeeping force that helped restore peace and stability. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established, and in 2004 it issued its final report, which included a long list of recommendations intended to remedy “some of the endemic problems that the TRC identified as causes of the war including issues relating to protecting human rights, fighting corruption, the need for wholesale reform of the justice and security sectors, and improving the democratic participation of youth and women.” 
In 2004 UN peacekeepers handed security over to Sierra Leone's armed forces and police and were replaced by a UN peacebuilding mission, UNIOSIL, which in 2008 was in turn replaced by the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL), which is tasked with monitoring and upholding human rights and the rule of law. 
According to Amnesty International, “tability and security have increased in Sierra Leone since 2002.” The government has made efforts to improve human rights on a variety of fronts, establishing “systems of accountability for human rights and humanitarian law violations committed during the conflict, and promoting rule of law and democratic governance,” according to a 2010 report by the International Center for Transitional Justice. Still, the country falls seriously short by most human-rights measures, and the ICTJ notes that despite “progress on its obligations to provide justice to victims of serious human rights violations,” Sierra Leone “needs to work harder” at implementing the TRC's recommendations.
The following chart shows Sierra Leone's ratings since 1972 in the Freedom in the World reports, published annually by Freedom House. A rating of 1 is "free"; 7, "not free".
Basic rights.
Although the law bans discrimination based on race, tribe, sex, and several other attributes, prejudice is widespread and customary laws enshrine various forms of discrimination. Also, citizenship is essentially denied to persons who are not of “Negro-African descent.” 
Although freedom of speech and of the press are officially guaranteed, they are often restricted and journalists engage in self-censorship. As a rule, journalists lack skills, resources, and professional ethics. Libel cases are rare. Radio is the major source of news, and in 2009 radio stations owned by political parties were closed by the government after riots. There are no restrictions on Internet access, academic freedom, cultural events, or freedom of assembly, although police have sometimes broken up demonstrations. On April 16-18, 2012, for example, police responded with disproportionate force to a protest in the town of Bumbuna by employees of African Minerals, killing one and severely wounding several more. 
The right to move freely around the country, travel abroad, move abroad, and move back to the country is guaranteed, although police demand bribes at roadblocks. While the Liberian border is officially open, border officials often extort bribes from travelers. From time to time, moreover, Guinean troops stationed on the border with that country harass Sierra Leonean locals.
In urban areas, vigilante violence against debtors, suspected thieves, and others is common. 
Sierra Leone as “safe haven” for war criminals 
A December 2012 report by Amnesty International described Sierra Leone as one of three countries in the world that are “safe havens for war crimes suspects,” noting that while some crimes under international law are also defined as crimes in Sierra Leone, the country “has not defined these crimes in accordance with the strictest requirements of international law.” Also, “most crimes under international law...remain outside the scope of Sierra Leonean courts.”
Women's rights.
There is widespread discrimination in Sierra Leone against women, who are routinely denied equal access to education, medical care, employment, and credit. In 2007, 43 percent of women in Sierra Leone were married to polygamous men. 
Women are at a significant disadvantage under the tribal laws that are in force everywhere except in the capital. These laws forbid, for example, the ownership of land by women. Tribal chiefs sometimes detain women and children or evict them from their homes in collusion with the women's husbands. Women's status in some ethnic groups is notably worse than in others, although they are effectively second-class citizens in all of the tribes. Tribal secret societies in rural areas hold forcible initiation rites that, in the case of women, involve genital mutilation. The number of such initiations, however, appears to be on the decrease. 
Rape is punishable by up to 14 years in prison but is very common, and, according to the U.S. State Department, is “viewed more as a societal norm than a criminal problem.” Rape victims are often urged to marry their rapists. There is no law against spousal rape. Rapists are rarely indicted, especially in rural districts, but since the Family Support Units (FSUs) were formed and the Gender Acts passed in 2007, reports of rapes have been on the rise. Thanks to corruption and inefficiency, rape cases rarely make it to trial, and convictions are all but unheard of. There are few medical or social services available to rape victims, who must pay prohibitive fees for medical reports in order to file charges. Women often withdraw complaints, moreover, for fear of stigma or retaliation or because they have been paid off. 
Sexual harassment is also widespread, and is not illegal. Wife-beating is taken for granted as a normal part of life, and most women consider it a justified punishment for such offenses as burning food or leaving the house without permission. Female genital mutilation, which is carried out mainly by women's secret societies, and which has been performed on 35-40 percent of women in the country, is on the decline owing to a growing sense that it is morally offensive, but remains a major problem. 
“The maternal mortality rate in Sierra Leone is one of the highest in the world,” Amnesty International notes. In 2009 a report by the organization described the country's high maternal and infant mortality rates as a “human rights emergency,” noting that one in eight women in the country risk dying during pregnancy or childbirth. The report gained wide attention, with an article in the Guardian noting that most women in the country “are too poor to pay for lifesaving treatment...Thousands bleed to death after giving birth. Most die in their homes. Some die on the way to hospital – in taxis, on motorbikes or on foot. Less than half of deliveries are attended by a skilled birth attendant and fewer than one in five are carried out in health facilities.” 
In September 2011, Amnesty International noted that despite the launch in Sierra Leone, a year earlier, of the Free Health Care Initiative, under which pregnant women and lactating mothers were supposed to receive free medical treatment, such women were still “being asked to pay for drugs, which they cannot afford.” An Amnesty International official called Sierra Leone's health-care system “dysfunctional in many respects,” with poor women and girls enjoying only “limited access to essential care in pregnancy and childbirth.” Nor is there an effective complaint process. 
The 2007 Domestic Violence Act, 2007 Devolution of Estates Act and 2009 Registration of Customary Marriage and Divorce Act, known as “the gender acts,” were intended to strengthen women's legal and financial position, and in 2010 the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender, and Children's Affairs began implementing a four-year National Gender Strategic Plan designed with the help of UN agencies. The ministry's efforts to protect women's rights are ineffectual, however, owing to a lack of resources and of cooperation on the part of other government bodies. In its 2011 report, the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone noted critically that while a Sexual Offences Bill had been drafted, it had not yet been introduced in Parliament.
Children's rights.
Only the children of “Negro-African descent” receive citizenship at birth; other children born in Sierra Leone become citizens of their parents' homelands. Others may apply for citizenship, but such applications must be personally approved by the president, and no such application has been approved since 2002. 
Primary school is supposedly free but schools demand fees and also charge for uniforms and books. Sexual abuse of children is a major and growing issue, and the government takes little action against it. Sierra Leone is a signatory of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, but not the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. It has had a Child Rights Act since 2007, but the law has been far from fully implemented. Marriage of girls under 18 is illegal, but forced child marriage is widespread, with more than half of females marrying before age 18. Child prostitution is also on the rise, with most of the street children in cities working as prostitutes. There is little effort by the government to do anything about this state of affairs. 
The Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone expressed concern in 2011 that pregnant girls
had been removed from an examination hall during the administration of an important test, the Basic Education Certificate Examination, an action that it described as “a denial of the right to education.”
Human trafficking.
The U.S. State Department's 2012 report on human trafficking identified Sierra Leone as “a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking.” Individuals are compelled to work in “prostitution, domestic servitude, and forced service or labor in artisanal diamond and granite mining, petty trading, portering, rockbreaking, street crime, and begging,” as well as “in the fishing and agriculture sectors.” Some persons also end up performing forced labor as a consequence of forced marriages. The report noted that “Sierra Leoneans voluntarily migrate to other West African countries, including Mauritania and Guinea, as well as to the Middle East and Europe, where they are subsequently subjected to forced labor and forced prostitution. Sierra Leone may also be a destination country for children trafficked from Nigeria, and possibly from The Gambia, Cote d’Ivoire, and Guinea, for forced begging, forced labor, and exploitation in prostitution.” 
The State Department report further observed that while Sierra Leone's government “does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking,” it “is making significant efforts to do so,” although its efforts to enforce anti-trafficking laws actually decreased in 2011. Also, “wareness of existing anti-trafficking laws remained weak, courts convicted no trafficking offenders, and fewer suspects were charged with trafficking crimes compared with the previous year.”
Disabled people's rights.
The problems of disabled persons are not a government priority in Sierra Leone. In its report for 2010, the U.S. State Department pointed out that there was no law prohibiting discrimination against disabled persons, no law protecting their rights, no law requiring that buildings be made wheelchair-accessible, and no government program for disabled people. In its 2011 report, the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone noted approvingly the passage in that year of the Persons with Disabilities Act 2011, which “would address the human rights concerns of Persons With Disability,” but added “that this Act has not been popularized and not much has been done to implement it, particularly the establishment of the National Commission for Persons with Disability.”
There is one primitive psychiatric facility in Sierra Leone.
Rights of refugees and asylum seekers.
The Refugeees Protection Act provides for assistance to refugees, and the country has helped Liberian refugees and has cooperated with the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), although individuals who may not have technically qualified as refugees have been denied assistance. Refugees have access to employment, social services, and the justice system.
Minority rights.
Tribal loyalty is important in many sectors of society, and ethnic discrimination is common. Non-Africans are denied citizenship and the sizable Lebanese minority feels largely alienated from mainstream society
LGBT rights.
Male, but not female, homosexuality is illegal. Persons known to be gay suffer intense social discrimnation. There are underground LGBT support groups. Lesbians are often subject to rapes planned by their families with the intention of turning them straight. 
The Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone noted in its report for 2011 that the government of Sierra Leone had signed a UN Human Rights Council statement in March of that year calling on nations “to take steps to end acts of violence, criminal sanctions and related human rights violations committed against individuals because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.” Yet the government had “rejected recommendations made during the UPR” that called on it to ban “discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and to repeal all provisions which may be applied to criminalize sexual activities between consenting adults.” The HRCSL further noted the “growing hostile comments on this issue in the media and by religious communities.”
HIV/AIDS rights.
Discrimination based on HIV status is illegal, but HIV-positive people are highly stigmatized, with HIV-positive children being denied schooling, adults denied jobs, and abandonment by families common. Persons with HIV are often driven to suicide.
Employment rights.
Workers may join unions, although are often pressured by employers not to do so, and unions may strike, but must give 21 days' notice. Collective bargaining is legal. Forced labor is illegal, but the law is not well enforced; such labor is especially widespread in diamond mining and is a traditional punishment imposed by tribal chiefs, although this practice seems to be on the decline. Labor by children under 13 is illegal, and work by older children is also limited by law, but these laws are not well enforced, and a high percentage of children are employed, especially in rural areas. Many street children are paid by adults to steal and beg, and some children are taken out of the country to work in homes. The Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender, and Children's Affairs is supposed to monitor such activities but does not do an effective job of it. 
Some children sent to cities to be schooled end up working on the street, and some children in orphanages are hired out as household workers. In rural villages, children often do arduous labor, and many children are forced to work in diamond mines. Although the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Mineral Resources are supposed to act against child labor, they do not do so effectively. There is a minimum wage, but it is low and is not enforced. Health and safety standards are not enforced either. There is no law against excessive compulsory overtime.
Rights of arrested persons.
Arbitrary arrest is illegal, but occurs, and although warrants are required under the law, most arrests are made without them, and some warrants were issued in irregular ways. In 2010, “nly high-profile cases that were scrutinized publicly were known to have been properly handled,” according to the U.S. State Department. Although the law requires that detainees be charged in court within 3 days of arrest (or, in some cases, 10), authorities routinely skirt this rule. The police lack equipment and are incapable of doing proper investigations or controlling riots. Police corruption is a major challenge, with officers dropping charges or making false arrests in return for payments, and demanding bribes at checkpoints on roads. Police brutality has declined, however, and so has impunity. Thanks to training in conduct and human rights, which is accomplished with the help of UN advisors, police are behaving more professionally and responsibly. 
The 2011 annual report by the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone praised “the stride taken by SLP [Sierra Leone Police[ to strengthen and improve on its capacity both in human resource and equipment despite the funding challenges confronting them.” It noted that the Police Complaints Discipline and Internal Investigations Department (CDIID) had received 1589 complaints against police officers in 2011 and had dismissed 29 officers for unprofessional conduct and suspended, reduced the rank of, or served warning letters to, over 1000 officers.
Rights of persons on trial.
Many defendants were kept in detention for long periods, averaging three to five years. The courts are generally independent, but government influence and corruption are occasionally a problem. Although the law requires that indigent defendants be provided with legal representation, the great majority of defendants have no lawyer, owing to a critical shortage of public defenders. Many cases are prosecuted by police officers with little or no legal training. Sentences vary widely from one district to another, with crimes like sacrilege and burglary being punished with several decades in prison; bribery can make the difference between a short and long sentence. 
In rural areas, tribal courts have the authority to try defendants, although they have no set law code, and there is frequent abuse of judicial power, with village chiefs, in their role as judges, often handing down excessively severe sentences, discriminating against women, and accepting bribes. Training programs run by the government and NGOs, however, have improved the situation. The 2011 report by the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone noted that “most people resort to the local and traditional courts to resolve their disputes and differences in areas where the formal court system are not accessible. These courts are less expensive, easily accessible and culturally acceptable as compared to the formal court system. However, the local courts decisions were often not consistent with human rights standards especially with regards the protection of women's rights.”
Rights of prisoners.
The Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone described prison conditions in 2011 as “appalling,” and noted that despite its recommendations in previous reports, “much improvement has not been made.” The U.S. State Department calls prison conditions in the country “harsh and sometimes life-threatening.” Among the major problems are overcrowding, beatings, solitary confinement, poor hygiene, inadequate lighting, bedding, and ventilation, and guards forcing inmates to sleep on wet floors. Beating of prisoners is common, but is becoming less frequent. Among the punishments authorized by law is lashing, with up to 36 lashes permitted. Prison gangs are known to beat fellow inmates at the direction of prison officials. During some times of the year, when wells dry up, prisoners must pay for water. 
Access to medical care is uneven, and even when inmates are taken to doctors, they are often refused treatment or given inadequate care owing to “the social stigma associated with assisting criminals and the Bureau of Prison's inability to pay medical bills.” Food supplies are poor, with underpaid guards often selling prisoners' rations instead of feeding them. Security is unprofessional, and prison breaks are common. Infants born in prison remain there for some time with their mothers, and are eventually handed over to family or placed in foster care. Minors are routinely imprisoned with adults. Rioting and violence among juvenile prisoners are common. Human-rights groups and others are allowed to inspect prisons. Inmates are allowed visitors, but in many cases, family members must pay bribes to be allowed to see them. 
Among the few improvements in prison conditions in recent years has been the introduction of skills-training programs.

KLLL-FM

KLLL-FM 96.3 MHz is a Country music station licensed and broadcast in Lubbock, Texas. Waylon Jennings is a notable former personality of KLLL, working at KLLL immediately before joining Buddy Holly on tour. When Buddy died, Waylon returned to KLLL. Waylon was fired shortly after by Sky Corbin. Originally licensed under the call letters KBFM. KBFM began in 1958 as an easy listening operation. It transmitted an SCA (Subsidiary Communications Authority) to transmit Muzak brand background music. Transmitter was located at the Great Plains Life Building (now known as Metro Tower) at Broadway and avenue M. Studios were originally at 2442 14th street, but were shortly moved to the fifth floor of the same building as the transmitter and antenna. Station was founded by a Mr. Blankenship. KLLL (AM) was in the same building with its studios on the top (20th) floor. In 1968 KLLL's owners the Corbins bought KBFM. It kept its call letters, stayed easy listening by day but carrying the country format of KLLL at night when the 1460 AM daytimer signed off. 
KBFM changed calls to KLLL in 1971 after the Lubbock Tornado. The studio building was damaged and the station relocated to the former KSEL studios on east broadway; KSEL had moved to 84th and L where they'd built the new channel 28 KSEL-TV (now KAMC). KLLL moved to 50th and L in 1976.
The Corbin family hired Jerry "Bo" Coleman as a radio host and made him a stockholder. In 1978, they sold KLLL AM/FM to Lubbock County Broadcasting, owned by James Thrash and John Frankhouser. Thrash and Frankhouseer in turn sold the company in 1987 to Pinnacle Broadcasting.
KLLL is currently owned by a privately held company Wilks Broadcasting.

Nonlinear expectation

In probability theory, a nonlinear expectation is a nonlinear generalization of the expectation. Nonlinear expectations are useful in utility theory as they more closely match human behavior than traditional expectations.
Definition.
A functional formula_1 (where formula_2 is a vector lattice on a probability space) is a nonlinear expectation if it satisfies:
Often other properties are also desirable, for instance convexity, subadditivity, positive homogeneity, and translative of constants.

Barbra Live

Barbra Live is the sixth concert tour by American recording artist, Barbra Streisand. Visiting North American and European markets, the tour Streisand's first tour since 2006. 
Barbra Live was the 22nd best-selling tour in the world in 2012, having earned $40.7 million and sold 154,287 tickets.
In April 2013 it was officially announced that Barbra would continue the tour through Europe in the summer of 2013.
Background.
Initially planned as two shows to mark the opening of the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the show was billed as Barbra's Homecoming: since Streisand had never performed a concert in Brooklyn. The shows sold out quickly and no further dates were added. On August 9, 2012 it was announced that Streisand would expand the series of concerts now opening in Philadelphia on October 8, 2012. On September 14, three additional engagements in America were added. One of these dates included the famous Hollywood Bowl where Barbra's 1967 performance—"An Evening with Barbra Streisand"—broke the Bowl's attendance record of the time, with an audience of 17,256 people.
Reception.
Critical.
The concerts received mostly positive reviews and critical acclaim. The "Ottawa Sun" reviewed the concert at Scotiabank Place and wrote "Streisand’s voice was truly exceptional. Intimate, yet on a grand scale, only she could do a concert that was small enough to feel personal, yet big enough to feel like a Broadway musical." Miriam Di Nunzio from the "Chicago Sun-Times" wrote "At 70, the singer still possesses one of the most pristine voices in music, a voice that completely and sumptuously envelops a room, even one the size of the cavernous United Center. There is an intimacy and honesty in Streisand’s delivery — a rare treat in this age of lip-synched, overblown concert extravaganzas." "The Jerusalem Post" wrote on her opening night in Philadelphia "Her voice (and cleavage) were better than many of the stars half her age that are currently touring." "The Vancouver Sun" stated that "The perennially decorated singer/actor/writer/director left an indelible mark on her Vancouver audience with a performance that was pure, undiluted class."
The show also garnered some negative reviews. The "Oakland Tribune" reviewed the San Jose concert at HP Pavilion and stated that Streisand relies too much on guest stars and wastes stage time for other performers. Jim Harrington wrote that the show "left too little time for what really should've been the focus of the night — Streisand's voice... I indeed look forward to seeing Streisand "Some Other Time" and when it happens, hopefully she'll leave some of her friends and family members behind."
Commercial.
The first shows at Brooklyn's Barclays Center sold out within a day of going on sale. After the show at the Hollywood Bowl sold out, an additional date was added. A second London show at The O2 Arena was added following the demand for the first show, which sold out quickly.

Involutinida

Involutinida is an order of Foraminifera found in the fossil record from the early Permian to early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) in which the proloculus, the initial chamber, is followed by an enrolled tubular second chamber. The test wall is calcareous, perforate, radiate, originally aragonitic but commonly recrystallized to homogeneous microgranular structure, with lamellar thickenings or pillar-like structures in umbilical region of one or both sides.
Taxonomy.
Four families are included in Involutinida, three of which, the Involutinidae, Hirsutospirellidae, and Planispirillinidae all have undivided tubular second chambers. The fourth, the Ventrolaminidae has numerous chambers following the proloculus. All four are represented by planispiral or trochospiral forms.
History.
The concept of the Involutinida seems to have developed over the years, beginning perhaps with the Involutinidae as described in the "Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology "Part C, 1964, which then was included in the Cassidulinacea, Rotaliina. This was expanded to the superfamily Involutinacea, named by Zaninetti, 1975, so accommodating additional families. Later, Hohenegger and Piller, 1977, the Involutinacea was redefined as the suborder Involutinina, now the Involutinida.

Harayir

Harayir (foaled 22 March 1992) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. In a racing career which lasted from June 1994 to October 1995 she ran thirteen times and won six races. As a two-year-old she won two races, including the Group Two Lowther Stakes at York. The following spring, Harayir became the first horse to win a Classic on a Sunday, when she was victorious in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse after being rejected by her regular jockey Willie Carson in favour of her owner's other runner Aqaarid. Her success gave her trainer Dick Hern his fourteenth and final classic winner. Later in the year, Harayir competed successfully against colts and older horses, winning the Hungerford Stakes at Newbury, the Celebration Mile at Goodwood and the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket. She was retired from racing to become a broodmare.
Background.
Harayir was a bay filly with white socks on her hind legs, bred in Kentucky by her owner, Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Farm. She was sired by Gulch, a son of Mr Prospector, who was named 1988 American Champion Sprint Horse. Gulch was a successful stallion, siring the multiple Group One winner Nayef and the Japan Cup Dirt winner Eagle Cafe. Harayir's dam, Saffaanh failed to win a race in five attempts, but was a daughter of the Irish Oaks winner Give Thanks. As a grand-daughter of the broodmare Violetta, Give Thanks was closely related to the Epsom Derby winner Teenoso.
Harayir was trained by the veteran Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire and was ridden in all but one of her races by Willie Carson.
Racing career.
1994: two-year-old season.
Harayir made her first racecourse appearance at Newbury Racecourse in June 1994. She started favourite for a six furlong maiden race and won by one and a quarter lengths from Royal Rebuke. At Newmarket's July meeting, Harayir was moved up in class to Group Three level to contest the six furlong Cherry Hinton Stakes. Willie Carson sent the filly into the lead a furlong and a half from the finish but she was caught in the last stride and beaten a short head by Red Carnival. At York in August, Harayir recorded her first major win in the Group Two Lowther Stakes. Starting the 2/1 joint favourite, she took the lead entering the final furlong and drew clear to win by three lengths from Gay Gallanta. The "Racing Post" described the performance as "impressive", and the filly was made ante-post favourite for the following year's 1000 Guineas. On her final appearance of the year, Harayir started favourite for the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket, and finished third to Gay Gallanta and Tanami. Gay Gallanta's performance was enough to see her named European champion two-year-old filly.
1995: three-year-old season.
Harayir's three-year-old debut saw her matched against colts as she carried top weight of 133 pounds in the European Free Handicap in April. She led briefly in the final furlong before finishing second to Diffident, a French-trained colt carrying 131. In his capacity as jockey for Hamdan Al Maktoum, Willie Carson had a choice of rides for the 1995 1000 Guineas. After being thought likely to partner Harayir he changed his mind and switched to Aqaarid, an unbeaten filly from the John Dunlop stable, leaving the ride on Harayir to Richard Hills: he described the decision as "a difficult choice". Aqaarid started 3/1 favourite for the 1000 Guineas, with Harayir sharing second place in the betting with the Godolphin filly Moonshell on 5/1. The race was the first British Classic to be run on a Sunday. Hills tracked the leaders on Harayir, before sending the filly to the front a furlong from the finish. Aqaarid and Moonshell emerged from the pack to challenge, but Harayir ran on strongly to win by one and a half lengths. Aqaarid beat Moonshell by three quarters of a length for second, with Gay Gallanta four lengths further back in seventh.
Carson was reunited with Harayir for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh three weeks later in which the British Classic winner was expected to prove comfortably superior to a field which included the leading Irish filly Ridgewood Pearl. Harayir reached second place in the straight but weakened to finish into fifth place eight lengths behind Ridgewood Pearl, who won easily. Harayir started favourite for her rematch with Ridgewood Pearl in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot where she was expected to be better suited by the firm ground. Ridgewood Pearl however, maintained her superiority, winning by two lengths from Smolensk, with Harayir third. In the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket Harayir suffered a third consecutive defeat after thunderstorms the day before the race softened her preferred firm ground. Attempting to concede six pounds to her opponents, she finished third to Caramba and Gay Gallanta.
In August, Harayir was dropped to Group Three level for the Hungerford Stakes at Newbury where she raced against colts and older horses. Despite carrying an eight pound weight penalty for her Classic win, she started 9/4 favourite and was never seriously pressed to win impressively from the four-year-old gelding Nijo. Fifteen days later, Harayir added a second success in mixed company, beating the colt Darnay by half a length in the Group Two Celebration Mile at Goodwood. In September Harayir moved down to sprint distances for the first time since her two-year-old days and finished fourth to Cool Jazz in the Diadem Stakes at Newmarket. Harayir's final appearance came in the Group Two Challenge Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket in October. She started favourite against a field which included Red Carnival and Cool Jazz, as well as the Lockinge Stakes winner Soviet Line. Carson retrained the filly before moving up to take the lead entering the final furlong. In the closing stages she was pushed out to win by half a length from Soviet Line. After the race, Hern praised the filly's durability and versatility, describing her as "a joy to train". Harayir was expected to end her career with a run in the Breeders' Cup Mile but sustained a leg injury when exercising at Belmont Park shortly before the race and was retired from racing.
Assessment.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Harayir an "inferior" winner of the 1000 Guineas.
Stud record.
Harayir was retired to become a broodmare for Shadwell Farm, being based at the Derrinstown Stud in County Kildare, Ireland. Her record had not been impressive. Her son Izdiham (sired by Nashwan) won at Listed level and finished third in the Gordon Stakes. Moonjaz, also by Nashwan, had some success as a racehorse in Switzerland.

Disaster opportunism

Disaster opportunism is the practice of exploiting a natural disaster, a miserable condition or emergency situation for one's selfish (political or economic) advantage. The phrase was used to describe the U.S. government's reaction to Hurricane Katrina.
Disaster opportunists capitalise or profit from a natural or man-made disaster.
It is usually done when people are in a vulnerable state or in shock, and are made to accept situations they would otherwise not find acceptable.
Examples of disaster opportunism: when politicians put up banners of their faces at relocation centres, or print their names and faces over relief goods being distributed in evacuation centres during or after a disaster; publicity stunts of bringing a set of candidates to a relief goods distribution centre, even when they are needed in their own constituent districts; and artificially jacking up prices of goods and services during or after a disaster.

During the ensuing years, additional functionality was added as new versions were produced. In 2013, version 9.0 was released for both Windows and the Mac.
Functionality.
MusicEase is both a music score editor and an automatic accompaniment generator. As a score editor, the user can create, edit, play and print high quality music notation. The user sees on the computer screen the musical score exactly as it will be printed out. As an automatic accompaniment creator/generator, it allows the user to quickly create accompaniment styles using the full range of notational functionality and to easily apply a style to a melody to add an accompaniment consisting of any number of general MIDI instruments including drums.
MusicEase is a constraint-based system with a large amount of knowledge of music notation. This allows it to handle intelligently many of the details of scoring automatically.
Jerry Pournelle, reviewer for Byte Magazine, says "The samples music printouts from MusicEase I have seen, and a couple I have produced, are sure in the same league as hand engraved."
Since many people are familiar with word processors, the notation aspect of MusicEase is designed to work much like a word processing program. For instance, pressing the G key enters the note G. Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or Backspace key (Windows) then deletes this note. Pressing the Enter key begins a new system. Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or Backspace key (Windows) at the beginning of a system appends it to the previous system. Blocks can be cut from one location and pasted into another location and then everything can be reformatted with just several keystrokes (using MusicEase's cast-off function which redetermines system breaks so that the density of notes in each system is roughly the same followed by the justify function to stretch/shrink all staves so they horizontally span from the left margin to the right margin.) Most functions are invoked via key presses which allows fast content entry as opposed to using the mouse to drag music notational elements from palettes to staves which generally requires more effort.
MusicEase supports a number of additional generally useful functions such as true transposition (as opposed to just shifting existing configurations up or down on the staff), part extraction (any combination of system staves can be extracted), scaling of the music to a large range of sizes, inverting or retrograding selected blocks of notes, combining 2 staves containing single voices into a single staff containing mixed single and double stemmed voicing and "vice-versa" (splitting a single staff with several voices into 2 separate staves, each containing a single voice), automatically adding chord fret diagrams, using any computer fonts for verses, titles, etc., unicode text support, and displaying music as tablature and/or as shape notes (4 or 7 shape systems --- the shapes associated with scale degrees can be fully customized.)
Prominent uses.
MusicEase was used by University of Colorado at Boulder Professor Emeritus of Music Karl Kroeger to create much of the music in "Music of the New American Nation - Sacred Music from 1780 to 1820", for which he was the main editor. Professor Kroeger states, "In particular, I acknowledge my debt to Gary M. Rader, developer of the MusicEase music notation software used for the musical scores" 
MusicEase Software's virtual songbook technology was created using MusicEase Professional. It allows a single piece of music to be ramified in many different ways (e.g., just verses or just the music displayed). Integrity Music, a major publisher of praise-worship music, used this functionality for the transposable sheet music versions of many of its recent products: e.g., the CD-Rom versions of its Hosanna! Music songbooks, versions 3 and 4 of its Worship Software, music available via its worshipleaderassistant.com and Worship Kitchen websites, and various iWorship CD-Rom songbooks.
The "Shout Music Manager" by Media Shout included this virtual songbook technology to provide transposable, customizable printed music.
Brentwood-Benson's "Praise and Worship Song Book with over 600 Songs" (lead sheet edition CD-rom) was also created using this functionality.

Public Orator

The Public Orator is a traditional official post at universities, especially in the United Kingdom. The person in this position acts at the voice of the university during public occasions.
The position at Oxford University dates from 1564. The Public Orator at the University presents honorary degrees, giving an oration for each person that is honoured. They may be required to compose addresses and letters as directed by the Hebdomadal Council of the University. Speeches when members of the royal family are present may also be required. The post was instituted for a visit to Oxford by Queen Elizabeth I in 1566. The Public Orator, Thomas Kingsmill, gave a very long historical speech. Sir Isaac Wake addressed King James I similarly in 1605.
At the University of Cambridge, the title for the position changed from "Public Orator" to "Orator" in 1926. Trinity College Dublin in Ireland also has a Public Orator. There is no equivalent position in American universities.

<doc id="36679240" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36679240" title="Transfer mispricing">
Transfer mispricing

Transfer mispricing, also known as "transfer pricing manipulation" or "fraudulent transfer pricing", refers to trade between related parties at prices meant to manipulate markets or to deceive tax authorities.
For example, if company "A", a food grower in Africa, processes its produce through three subsidiaries: "X" (in Africa), "Y" (in a tax haven, usually offshore financial centers) and "Z" (in the United States). Now, Company "X" sells its product to Company "Y" at an artificially low price, resulting in a low profit and a low tax for Company "X" based in Africa. Company "Y" then sells the product to Company "Z" at an artificially high price, almost as high as the retail price at which Company "Z" would sell the final product in the U.S.. Company "Z", as a result, would report a low profit and, therefore, a low tax.
About 60% of capital flight from Africa is from improper transfer pricing. Such capital flight from the developing world is estimated at ten times the size of aid it receives and twice the debt service it pays.
The African Union reports estimates that about 30% of Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP has been moved to tax havens. Solutions include corporate “country-by-country reporting” where corporations disclose activities in each country and thereby prohibit the use of tax havens where real economic activity occurs.
While appropriate Transfer pricing of tangible goods can be established by comparison with prices charged for similar goods to unrelated parties, transfer pricing if intangible goods, products of intellectual efforts, rarely have comparable equivalents. Transfer prices then have to be established based on expectations of future income. Mispricing is rife.
Khadija Sharife and John Grobler, writing for the World Policy Journal, exposed $3.5 billion minimum in transfer mispricing of African diamonds from Angola and DRC, through the use of intra-company valuation, shell companies and tax havens, notably Dubai and Switzerland.

Trafford Park Railway

The Trafford Park Railway System is the mainly disused railway system that runs around the site of large Trafford Park Industrial Estate, which closed in 1998, although much of its infrastructure remains.
History of System.
The system's history started at the end of the 19th century there were no public transport routes in Trafford Park. Due to the size of Trafford Park meant that the Estates Company was obliged to provide some means of travelling around the park, and so a gas-powered tramway was commissioned to carry both people and freight. The first tram ran on 23 July 1897.
Earlier Years.
The service was operated by the British Gas Traction Company, which paid a share of its takings to the Estates Company, but by 1899 the company was in serious financial difficulty, and entered voluntary liquidation. Salford Corporation then refused to provide any more gas for the trams, and the service was once again suspended until the Estates Company bought the entire operation for £2,000 in 1900. A separate electric tramway was installed in 1903, and was taken over and operated by Manchester and Salford Corporations in 1905. The takeover did not affect the gas trams however, which continued to run until 1908, when they were replaced by steam locomotives. Between 1904 and 1907 the Estates Company also operated a horse-drawn bus for the use of "gentlemen" staying at Trafford Hall, then a hotel. The service, available 24-hours a day, was replaced by a motor car in 1907.
Under an 1898 agreement between the Estates Company and the Ship Canal Company, the latter committed to carry freight on their dock railway between the docks and the park and to the construction of a permanent connection between the two railway networks. The West Manchester Light Railway Company was set up the following year to take over the operations of the tramway and to lay additional track. In 1904 responsibility for all of the parks roads and railways passed to the Trafford Park Company, as a result of the Trafford Park Act of that year. The railway network could subsequently be extended as required, without the need to seek additional permissions from Parliament.
Size of Network.
The network was also connected to the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway near Cornbrook. At its peak, the estate's railway network covered 26 route miles (42 km), handling about 2.5 million tons of cargo in 1940. Like the rest of the park, it fell into decline during the 1960s, exacerbated by the increasing use of road transport, and it was closed in 1998.
Present Day.
The Trafford Park Euroterminal rail freight terminal, which has the capacity to deal with 100,000 containers a year, was opened in 1993, at a cost of £11 million. In addition to this Freightliner continues to serve the Barton Dock freight terminal adjacent to the Trafford Centre.
Most of the rest of the system still exists but it is disused.

Levante Offensive

The Levante Offensive, launched near the end of March 1938, was an attempt by Nationalist forces under Francisco Franco to capture the Republican held city of Valencia during the Spanish Civil War. The Nationalists occupied the province of Castellón, but the offensive failed due to bad weather and the dogged resistance of the Republican troops at the XYZ defensive line.
Background.
Following the success of the Aragon Offensive resulting in the Nationalist armies reaching the Mediterranean Sea, the Republic was split in two; the Spanish Republican Army was in disarray and the road to Barcelona was open for conquest by the Nationalists. Even General Vicente Rojo said that Barcelona could have been taken with "less force and in less time" than in January 1939. The Nationalist generals and Francisco Franco's German and Italian allies expected a swift attack against Barcelona. Nevertheless, Franco decided to turn south against the capital of the Spanish Republic at Valencia, because he feared French intervention in Catalonia, following the Anschluss. Furthermore, he didn't want a swift end to the war, as he wanted a war of annihilation against the Republic in order to crush all opposition. Dionisio Ridruejo said that: "A long war meant total victory. Franco chose the crueller option which, from his point of view, was also more effective."
Nationalist offensive.
The Nationalist offensive started on 25 April, with General José Enrique Varela's Army Corps of Castille, Antonio Aranda's Galician corps, and Garcia Valiño's formation, but the advance was halted on 27 April. On 1 May, the Nationalists continued their offensive, advancing on three fronts from Teruel (Varela), the Mediterranean sea coast (Aranda), and a central column moving between them through the mountains (Garcia Valiño). The Nationalists found it slow going due to rainy weather in March and April that slowed the offensive, the difficult terrain that aided the defense of Republican forces being driven back before them, and the dogged determination of the Republican troops, reinforced with new weapons brought in from France: Soviet "Supermosca" (I-16 Type 10) fighters with four machine-guns, 40 Grumman FF fighters and anti-aircraft guns. On June 13, Castellón fell to Garcia Valiño's corps after several days of fighting but they were halted short of Sagunto where the mountains of the Sierra de Espadán came close to the sea. With the fall of Castellón, the Nationalists had a Mediterranean harbor into which munitions and food could be brought to the Nationalists troops in this front.
The Nationalists were surprised by the resistance of the Republican forces, and General Alfredo Kindelán tried to persuade Franco to abandon the operation. The Condor Legion was exhausted and was eventually withdrawn from the front. Nevertheless, Franco ordered the attack to be continued and Valencia be captured by July 25. By the beginning of July, the Nationalists reinforced the front with three divisions of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV), led by General Mario Berti, and four divisions of General José Solchaga's Turia Corps. Furthermore, the Nationalists had nine hundred cannon and four hundred aircraft in this front, and had just received about 50 Italian medium bombers (BR.20, SM.79, SM.81). Opposing the Nationalists, the Republicans had the six army corps (Palacio's XVI Corps, Garcia Vallejo's XVII, Vidal's XIX, Duran's XX and Ibarrola's XXII, as well as Güemes's Group A and Romero's Group B) of General Leopoldo Menéndez's Army of the Levante.
On 5 July, Garcia Valiño attacked from Castellón, but he was stopped by the Republican forces led by Colonel Gustavo Duran and General Menendez at the Sierra de Espadan. The final push of the Nationalist offensive began on 13 July. To the west, Solchaga's corps moved south from Teruel with Varela's corps and the Italian CTV on their flank to the east, and the Garcia Valiño formation tried to advance down the coast. After some determined resistance at Mora de Rubielos and Sarrion, the Republican line in the Sierra de Toro crumbled. The Nationalists then advanced 60 miles along a front of twenty miles wide until they were stopped by the XYZ Line fortifications running east and west from Viver into the Sierra de Espadan.
Battle of XYZ line.
Between July 18 and July 23, these defenses, held by two Republican corps led by Colonels Ernesto Güemes and Carlos Romero, were successful in halting the Nationalist advance. The Nationalists tried to break the republican defenses with waves of infantry and intense bombing raids, but the Republican defenders through the use of well planned trenches and protected lines of communication were able to inflict heavy casualties on the Nationalists (about 20,000 casualties), suffering relatively few themselves (only 5,000 casualties). On July 23, the offensive was halting and the Republican offensive in the north on July 24, the Battle of the Ebro, prevented any further assaults on the line by drawing away eight Nationalist divisions and their heavy artillery. The Nationalist offensive ended less than forty kilometres from Valencia.
Aftermath.
According to Beevor, the defense of the XYZ Line was a far greater victory for the Republic than the Guadalajara. The Nationalists occupied the province of Castellon, but failed to occupy Valencia and suffered heavy casualties. The Republican Army had time to reorganize, and to plan the assault across the River Ebro. Furthermore, the Republican forces in Catalonia had time to rearm with the weapons received across the French frontier, reopened in March.

Austin 15 hp

The Austin 15 hp was a motor car manufactured by the British Austin Motor Company, sold between 1908 and 1915.
The original 15 hp, of which 213 were produced, was sold between 1908 and 1910. It was powered by a 4-cylinder 2½-litre (2539 cc) monobloc engine, the only pre-war model to have one with a x stroke and three-bearing crank-shaft.
A revised 15 hp model was introduced in 1911, losing the monobloc design, but with an increased stroke of , 2838 cc, side-valve T-head engine design, and was actually rated at 19.6 hp. Austin manufactured 688 of these more powerful models. It had a four-speed gearbox with cone clutch, shaft and bevel-drive back axle. Suspension was provided by semi-elliptic leaf springs at the front and Austin-patent full-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Brakes were by rear wheel drum and transmission brakes. The wheels were wooden artillery style wheels with Michelin detachable rims, 815 x 105 beaded-edge tyres. In 1913, a powered chassis with tyres was available for £350.
As with many Austins of the period it was available in a wide range of bodies, including a two-seater "Harrogate" (with single rear dicky seat), a two-seater "Ascot", a four-seater "Westminister Landaulet" or "Levee Single Landaulet" and a snub-nose "Town Carriage" with an open driver and closed passenger layout. A four-seat open tourer was only available until 1910.

Erich Šlomović

Erich Šlomović (, also known as Erich Chlomovitch) (1915–1942) was a Jewish art collector in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He was an assistant and protégé of Ambroise Vollard.
Early life.
Šlomović was born in Đakovo (Austro-Hungarian Empire) in 1915 to a Jewish family of Bernard and Roza Šlomović. He had a brother, Egon.
Career.
IIn the 1930s, Šlomović moved to Paris, where he was befriended by legendary art collector Ambroise Vollard. Through Vollard, Šlomović met the greatest artists of the age, including Picasso, Matisse, Cocteau, Rouault among others, and was able to amass an impressive personal collection of some 600 works. Vollard died in a car accident in July 1939. Shortly after that, with France on the brink of Nazi invasion, Šlomović decided to return to Yugoslavia, where the war had not yet spread. He left about 200 artworks in a vault in the Société Générale in Paris, and the rest he had shipped via diplomatic pouch to Belgrade. These were exhibited at a highly acclaimed exhibition in Zagreb in 1940.
World War II.
During World War II, with the Independent State of Croatia establishment in 1941, Šlomović and his family moved to Bačina in Serbia in an attempt to save themselves.
While in Bačina, Šlomović hid the paintings he brought with him. Later, as a part of the German reprisals of 100 Serbian men shot for every German soldier killed, Bernard, Erich and Egon were taken to detention camp in Ćuprija. Soon after, they were all killed. Erich's mother Rosa and female cousin Mara were not touched and neither was his collection. They both survived the Holocaust hidden by the local population.
Legacy.
After his death, Šlomović mother donated his collection to the National Museum of Serbia. In 1989 Veljko Bulajić directed "Donator", a movie dedicated to Šlomović's tragic life while in 2004 Momo Kapor wrote a book about his life. The paintings in the Société Generale bank were discovered in 1979 when the bank was allowed to open the vault to recover unpaid storage fees. There is a legal dispute over the ownership of those paintings.

Nageshvara-Chennakeshava Temple complex, Mosale

The Nageshvara-Chennakeshava temple complex (also spelt Nagesvara and Chennakesava) is an elegant example of Hoysala architecture of the early 12th century. It is located in the village of Mosale, about 10 km from Hassan city, in Hassan district of Karnataka state, India. The temple was built in 1200 A.D. during the reign of Hoysala King Veera Ballala II. According to art historian Gerard Foekema, the two temples that are built next to each other, in an idyllic rural setting, form a "perfect twin". This temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India.
Architecture.
By plan, the temples are simple single shrined structures with all the standard features of Hoysala architecture; a porch entrance into a square closed "mantapa" or "navaranga" (hall with no windows and a thick wall) leading to the sanctum, and a superstructure ("sikhara") over the main shrine fitting the description of a "ekakuta" (single shrine with top). The sanctum ("garbhagriha") is connected to the hall by a vestibule called "sukhanasi". The closed hall, whose inner and outer walls are decorated has four central lathe turned pillars that support a bay ceiling. The temples are constructed next to each other. The Nageshvara temple ("lit", "Lord of snakes"), dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva (represented by his universal symbol, the "linga") is in the south. The Chennakeshava temple ("lit", "beautiful Vishnu"), dedicated to a standing cult image of the Hindu god Vishnu, is to the north. Since all features are replicated in the temples, Gerard Foekema considers the ensamble a "dvikuta" (two shrines with two towers). 
The superstructure (tower or "sikhara") over each shrine is three tiered ("tritala arpita") and "vesara" in style. It is intact, finely sculptured and has a decorative low extension which is actually the tower over the vestibule (that connects the cella (sanctum) and the hall). The extension tower looks like the "nose" of the main superstructure and is also called "sukhanasi". The "sukanasi" structure holds the beautiful Hoysala crest that depicts a royal warrior stabbing a lion. At the top of the superstructure of the shrine is a "helmet" like sculptured dome ("amalaka") whose ground surface area can be 2x2 meters. It is the largest piece of sculpture in the temple. The "amalaka" supports a decorative water pot like structure called the "kalasha" which is the apex of the tower.
All these features are intact in both temples. 
The temple outer wall decorative features (horizontal treatment) belong to the "old kind". In this type of decoration, below the superstructure, an eaves that projects about half a meter runs all around the temple. Below the eaves are decorative miniature towers (aedicula) on pilasters. In the "old kind", the large wall images of deities and their attendants are placed below these decorative towers. Some of these images appear damaged, but there are others that require special mention for their elegance and art. The panel images at the Nageshvara temple have their names on their pedestals. Some of these are images of Sridevi, Lakshmidevi, Gauri, Maheshvari (another name for Parvati), Brahma, Sadashiva (form of Shiva) and Bhumidevi (representation of mother earth). The Channakeshava temple has sculptures of Garuda (the eagle), Keshava (a form of Vishnu), Janardana, Venugopala, Madhava (a form of Krishna) and Bhudevi. Below these images, the base of the wall comprises five different horizontal moldings, one of which is a row of blocks.

ANDRA Top Fuel

ANDRA Top Fuel is a class of Australian drag racing. It caters to the premium Nitromethane burning 300 inch long Dragsters. The class uses large-capacity, supercharged V8 engines with a displacement of 500 cubic inches. Identical to the Top Fuel class in the America NHRA.
Top Top in Australia is regulated by ANDRA, and is considered a Group 1 or professional category. Top Fuel Dragsters are the fastest accelerating vehicles in the world. These are the most recognisable of all Drag Racing cars.
The 25-foot-long landlocked human propulsion systems can cover the quarter mile in 4.4 seconds at up to 540 kilometres per hour. Mostly using a 4130 chrome moly chassis constructed in the USA. They weighs a tiny 1000 kg which makes for a massive power to weight ratio. All of the body components are constructed from carbon fibre, titanium and awesome.
The total finished cost of a Top Fuel dragster is estimated at $500,000, that's over 13000 cases of VB!
Some notable drivers competing in this category are Darren Morgan, Andrew Cowin, Phil Lamattina, Damian Harris, and various drivers representing Santo Rapisarda.
The nitro burning 8000+ horse-powered Top Fuel dragsters. Top Fuel is the elite Drag Racing category, known as the “Playground of rich bogans”. The dragsters that race within this category are capable of covering a quarter mile from a standing start in as little as 4.5 seconds. They achieve speeds in excess of 530 kmph (330 mph) by the finish line and are the fastest accelerating vehicles on the planet, faster even than a Space Shuttle. The energy and sound these incredible machines generate can be felt through the ground and into your body from the grandstand as they thunder down the track, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale on each pass.
In order to exceed 300 mph in 4.5 seconds Dragsters must accelerate at an average of over 4G's. In order to reach 200 mph well before half-track, the launch acceleration approaches 8G's. Each run consumes approximately 100 litres of Nitro Methane. Dragsters reach over 300 miles per hour before you have completed reading this sentence. Top Fuel Engines turn approximately 540 revolutions from light to light! Including the burnout the engine must only survive 900 revolutions under load
On one occasion, F111 pilots were given the opportunity of standing on the start line between two Top Fuel dragsters as they launched down the track. The pilots immediately commented that,even though they fly an extremely fast fighter. In their words the Top Fuel dragsters were “hectic”. These machines would certainly grab anyones attention, with 10-foot high flames visible from the header pipes at night, adding to the spectacle, making Top Fuel dragsters something that truly must be seen to be believed.

Self-licensing

Self-licensing (aka "moral self-licensing", "moral licensing", "licensing effect") is a term used in social psychology and marketing to describe the subconscious phenomenon whereby increased confidence and security in one’s self-image or self-concept tends to make that individual worry less about the consequences of subsequent immoral behavior and, therefore, more likely to make immoral choices and act immorally. In simple terms, self-licensing occurs when people allow themselves to indulge after doing something positive first; for example, drinking a diet soda with a cheeseburger can lead one to subconsciously discount the negative attributes of the meal’s high caloric and cholesterol content.
Self-licensing can have negative societal consequences since it has a permissive effect on problematic behaviors, such as racial prejudice and discrimination, selfishness, poor dietary and health habits, and excessive energy consumption.
Definitions.
Researchers Uzma Khan and Ravi Dhar describe the phenomena as follows:
Similarly, Anna Merritt and colleagues explained that:
Examples of self-licensing.
Research suggests that self-licensing affects moral self-regulation and individual behavior in a variety of contexts; for example, it can influence consumer purchases, political opinions, charitable giving, energy policy and home energy use, job hiring, racial attitudes, health-related decision-making, risky sexual behavior, alcohol consumption, and dietary supplement use. Washington Post staff writer Michael Rosenwald described the following everyday examples of self-licensing behavior:
Dietary supplement use and unhealthy behavior.
A 2011 study published by researchers in Taiwan indicated that people who take multivitamin pills, especially those who believe that they are receiving significant health benefits from supplement use, are more prone to subsequently engage in unhealthy activities. Participants in the study were divided into two groups, both of which were given placebo pills; one group was correctly informed that the pills contained no active ingredients and the other group was told that the pills were multivitamin supplements. Survey results showed that participants who thought that they had received a multivitamin were predisposed to smoking more cigarettes and more likely to believe that they were invulnerable to harm, injury, and disease as compared with subjects who knew that they were given a placebo. Participants who believed they were given a multivitamin were also less likely to exercise and to choose healthier food, and had a higher desire to engage in "hedonic activities that involve instant gratification but pose long-term health hazards", such as casual sex, sunbathing, wild parties, and excessive drinking. In the ‘multivitamin’ group, the more supplements a participant used, the less likely they were to exercise, and smoking was highest among participants who expressed a conscious belief that multivitamins increased health. 
The study’s authors argued that because dietary supplements are perceived as conferring health advantages, use of such supplements may create an illusory sense of invulnerability that disinhibits unhealthy behaviors. Overall, the study shows that people who take supplements may feel that merely taking a pill is a sufficient contribution to healthful living to enjoy other activities without regard to health, and it exposes a potential hypocrisy among supplement users. The authors advised:
Commenting on the implications of the study, Ben Goldacre said:
Consumer purchasing decisions.
Researchers Khan and Dhar investigated the influence of self-licensing on consumer decisions regarding the purchase of luxury goods. They reasoned that “relative preferences for a luxury option will be higher if people’s prior decisions provide a boost to their relevant self-concept”. Due to the self-licensing effect “a prior intent to be virtuous boosts respondents’ self-concepts, thus reducing negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries”. Furthermore, they predicted that consumers may be unaware of how their prior decision influences their subsequent choices; i.e. the process underlying the licensing effect may be largely nonconscious. In the study, some participants were first asked to select from a list a charity organizations for which they would willingly volunteer three hours a week. Later, these people—and participants who hadn't been asked to volunteer—were asked whether they would buy designer jeans or an identically priced vacuum cleaner, assuming that they had enough money to buy only one. Participants who were asked to imagine having committed the charitable act before shopping were more than twice as likely to choose the jeans. The authors noted that “People don't even have to do good for this effect to happen…Even if they plan to do something good, it will give them a boost in their self-image. Any type of situation where you have guilt involved, you will see this, and so this happens in luxury goods."
A study by University of Toronto behavioral marketing professor Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong found that people who bought green products were more likely to cheat and steal than those who bought conventional products. The researchers conducted an experiment in which they asked college students to shop for products online from either an eco-friendly or a conventional store. Each subject was then asked to divide a small sum of money between themselves and a stranger in a paradigm known as the dictator game, in which participants can cheat to make more money. The shoppers from the green store were more dishonest than those at the conventional store, which brought them higher earnings in the game. The authors suggested that the results could be accounted for by the licensing effect, noting that “When we engage in a good deed, that gives us a kind of satisfaction. With that self-satisfied feeling can come tacit permission to behave more selfishly next time we have the opportunity”. The authors added that "purchasing green products may license indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors," and concluded:
Energy use.
Researchers have invoked the self-licensing effect to explain why consumers who opt for energy-efficient products increase their energy usage so as to offset any potential gains. Energy economist Lucas Davis published a study showing that after getting high-efficiency washers, consumers increased clothes washing by nearly 6 percent. Other studies have shown that people leave energy-efficient lights on longer than conventional lights, and that many people who make their homes more energy efficient turn their heating up and ultimately see no reduction in energy costs.
Political opinions and racial bias.
The self-licensing effect was examined by Monin and Miller in a 2001 study which demonstrated that when participants established credentials as non-prejudiced persons, they were more willing to express politically incorrect opinions despite the fact that the audience was unaware of their credentials. Subsequent research by Monin and Daniel Effron showed that an opportunity to endorse Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential election made his supporters more likely to express views that favored Whites at the expense of African-Americans. Essentially, the endorsement made people feel like they had shown that they were not biased, giving them a license to subsequently express prejudicial and racially problematic views.

The Freudian Fallacy

The Freudian Fallacy, first published as Freud and Cocaine in the United Kingdom, is a 1983 book about Sigmund Freud by medical historian Elizabeth M. Thornton. She argues that Freud became a cocaine addict and that his theories the direct outcome of his use of cocaine.
Summary.
Thornton, a medical historian, calls Freud "a false and faithless prophet" and his theories "baseless and abberational." She argues that Freud became a cocaine addict and that his theories were shaped by this addiction. She believes that Freud's ideas were the direct outcome of his use of cocaine, "a toxic drug with specific effects on the brain." She argues that the unconscious mind does not exist. She also deals with Freud's relationship to Jean-Martin Charcot and criticizes the concept of hysteria, arguing that many of the conditions Freud diagnosed as hysteria were actually organic illnesses that either Freud himself or 19th century medicine as a whole failed to recognize. In her view, agoraphobia is invariably caused by disorders of the inner ear which affect the sense of balance.
Scholarly reception.
"The Freudian Fallacy" was described by historian Peter Gay as "a model in the literature of denigration" in his "" (1988). However, the book has been praised by several writers critical of psychoanalysis, including psychologist Hans Eysenck in his "Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire" (1985). Social and cultural theorist Todd Dufresne considers it a notable work on the history of psychoanalysis, and the single best work on Freud's cocaine period.
Cultural historian Richard Webster considers Thornton's book one of the most interesting contributions to Freud studies. He considers Thornton's discussion of Charcot and hysteria to be more significant than her argument that Freud's theories were shaped by his cocaine use. Webster observes that while not explicitly feminist, "The Freudian Fallacy" has sometimes been endorsed by feminists. He compares it to Jeffrey Masson's "The Assault on Truth" (1984), noting that both books are marked by hostility to Freud and psychoanalysis. Webster believes that Thornton takes her argument about the organic basis of hysteria too far, and that its excesses tend to discredit the more reasonable aspects of her book. He nevertheless writes that some of her claims are both original and persuasive, and that her detailed review of the medical context within which Charcot and Freud worked contains many neglected insights. Webster criticizes the press coverage that Thornton's book received, writing, "In Britain, Thornton's claims about Freud's addiction to cocaine generated a small amount of sensational and shallow coverage in "The Sunday Times Magazine"." According to Webster, it was largely ignored in the British quality press, with the exception of hostile reviews in "The Times Literary Supplement" and "The London Review of Books", the latter of which included a false accusation of anti-Semitism that was later withdrawn with an apology.

Mary Queen of Peace Catholic Church Pottsville, Pennsylvania

Mary Queen of Peace Church, Pottsville is a Roman Catholic church in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. It is located at 728 North Centre Street. The current structure was built in 1929.
History.
Mary Queen of Peace Catholic Church, Pottsville, was established in 1920 as a new parish under the direction of Cardinal Dougherty, Archbishop of the Philadelphia Diocese. The new parish, organized by father George Shea was created to serve the faithful of the northern part of the city apostle and the surrounding area. From the humble beginnings in the renovated stable on the former Seltzer property, the parish celebrated mass in a new chapel on August 15, 1920. Dedication for the present Spanish Mission Style Church built on the same property was August 25, 1929, with Cardinal Dougherty laying the cornerstone. From its early days until the present the parish has served as a comparison served as a focal point for many social events since 1961 the church has been a parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Allentown.
In July 2008, the Parish was selected to close and consolidate with Saint Patrick's Parish as a result of the Diocese of Allentown's 2008 restructuring of parishes.
On August 15, 2012, Holy Mass on the Solemnity of the Assumption of Mary was celebrated for the first time at Mary Queen of Peace since its closure in 2008. The church was filled to capacity with over 300 parishioners wanting to worship at the noon mass and return to the beloved Pottsville Catholic Church.
Mary Queen of Peace Parochial School.
The Mary Queen of Peace Parochial School was a coeducational Catholic grade school part of the Mary Queen Parish. The school first opened in fall 1925 after rectors of the city's two original parishes, St. John the Baptist Church, Pottsville, PA and St. Patrick's noticed that overcrowding and distance were negative factors for those residing in the Fishbach and Jalappa dential districts. A letter written by Cardinal Dougherty in 1919 directed that a new parish be established with land being purchased at Center and Nichols Street. The temporary location of the mission church was located at nearby Mt. Laffee.
Once the debt financing the construction of the main church and the purchasing of the rectory was established, discussions began on plans to open a parochial school as well as a convent for the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary who would serve as the faculty. An original home in the complex was remodeled and enlarged with a second property converted into the convent. The school opened in September 1925
After 41 years of service, the school was no longer able to meet safety standards as the building deteriorated with age. Considerable renovations and modifications would have been needed in order for the facility to remain in compliance. Rather than move forward with the renovations, the diocese determined demolition would be more cost effective. Approximately 180 pupils were transferred to St. John the Baptist School on the 900 block of Howard Avenue after a meeting with Rev. Charles McNulty of Mary Queen of Peace and Rev. Francis J. Fox of St. John's. The school was closed on June 15, 1966.

Joe Andoe

Joe Andoe (born 1955) is an American artist, painter, and author. His works have been featured in exhibits internationally and also numerous museums including the Denver Art Museum, the Detroit Institute of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. He is the author of the book " Jubilee City: A Memoir at Full Speed (P.S.)", which is a memoir about his life.
Early life and education.
Andoe was born on December 5, 1955 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In the 1970s Andoe spent most of his time partying, drinking alcohol and doing drugs. He was previously arrested for reckless driving and drug possession. In an interview with National Public Radio, Andoe stated that the friends he knew during that era either died or went to prison.
Although Andoe loved to draw, he never created works when he was younger, as he thought that painting was not something that men did and he also needed a steady income that he did not pursue as an artist. Andoe first realized that painting could be his career when he was enrolled in community college studying agricultural business. He was taking an elective class in art history when he learned about artists such as Robert Smithson and Dennis Oppenheim. He soon changed his major an eventually earned a Master's Degree in Art from the University of Oklahoma in 1981.
After college, Andoe began pushing his works on different museums in New York. He later married and moved to New York in 1985. Andoe continued drinking and using drugs, and his marriage later fell apart. One of the reasons he left Tulsa was due to the Tulsa Museum refusing to hang any of his art work. However, the museum was later forced to hang his artwork as it was part of a traveling show from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
After his divorce, Andoe began to receive a following and quit drinking. He continues to paint and currently lives in New York City.
Paintings.
Andoe is known for his use of monochromatic earth-colors. He has stated that he wants to "reduce images to their blueprint." He paints subjects such as horns, wreaths, candles, flowers, cornstalks, trees, cattle, buffaloes, lamps, sheep, and horses. Numerous sources state that his art is instantly recognizable. He paints by incising the outlines of what he is painting and then wipes away the paint to reveal the canvas underneath. This is an original reductive technique that contrasts the denseness of the background paint with the rough canvas surface.
Andoe has an extensive exhibition record. Paintings by Andoe are represented in permanent collections of the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and MoMA in New York, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He is also featured in the hall of fame at the Ford Project in New York.
Writing career.
Andoe began wrting in 2002 and was first published in 2003 by Open City Magazine, a New York City magazine that featured many first-time writers. That same year he was published in Bomb and Bald Ego. Andoe had authored a comic book sized group of stories about his life and in 2005, Harper Collins asked him to create a longer version of the stories. These were the inspiration for the book "Jubilee City: A Memoir at Full Speed (P.S.)" which was published in 2007. The book received numerous reviews including from the New York Times and USA Today.
Personal life.
Andoe currently lives in New York. He has two children, one son and one daughter.

Stapleford Woods

Stapleford Woods are an area of ancient woodland and forest in Stapleford, Lincolnshire, England. The boundary of the ancient woods marks the county boundary between Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire.
History.
Left in ancient times to Trinity College, Cambridge, the site was clear-felled during the early stages of World War I to supply local industry. Left unplanted between the wars, the grounds were used as a British Army camp and training grounds during World War II.
In September 1943 No. 239 Squadron RAF had moved to RAF Ayr to train as a night fighter unit, and re-equipped with the De Havilland Mosquito. It then moved to RAF West Raynham, Norfolk to join No. 100 (Bomber Support) Group, participating in night time operations against enemy Nazi-Luftwaffe fighters. On 27 October 1944 during fighter affiliation training with No. 49 Squadron RAF, a Mosquito piloted by F/Lt J.H.Roberts and accompanied by Flight Engineer Sgt. A.M.Ashcroft, stalled and crashed in the woods, with the immediate death of both pilot and passenger.
After the cessation of hostilities, in late 1945 the woods were bought by the newly formed Forestry Commission. Along with a lot of woodland within the River Trent valley, in the 1950s the site was extensively replanted with both Scots and Corsican pine, chosen to supply local industry.
Present.
Now a managed working forest under the care of the Forestry Commission, surveys in 2004 found that the wood dated back at least 400 years, making it a designated ancient woodland. While many visitors are attracted by the Victorian era-plated Rhododendrons which are found throughout the wood at heights of up to , the Forestry Commission and North Kesteven council have agreed a 50 year plan to restore the forest to its original broad-leaf tree state. Initial clearance of a area yielded a resultant crop of purple flowering heather, which germinated from seeds that had been buried for over 70 years.
Leisure.
The Forestry Commission carpark , provides access to a marked circular walk, which takes 30-40mins at a leisurely pace to complete. The car park can be access from Coddington Lane, and is sign posted off of this road whilst travelling through the wood.
The Real Badlands.
The woods were the main backdrop for the 2009 documentary film "The Real Badlands" produced by Current TV and Rockwood Pictures, by British filmmakers Tim Clark and Craig Ford. The film tells the story of a Newark on Trent couple (Simon Burgess and Susan Moran), who fed up with modern day life, quit their jobs, sell all of their possessions, and move into the woods.
The film was shot in the woods and Kelham, near Newark on Trent, during the summer and winter of 2008. After release the film was controversial, due to claims that the film was in fact a mockumentary. The filmmakers publicly denied these claims in a written statement read out live on Current TV, minutes after the film was broadcast.
Controversy.
In July 2012, the woods made national headlines after the Forestry Commission cleared undergrowth within the woods, which were said to be attracting large numbers of doggers, scaring families and ramblers. Police patrols by both Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Police have been increased, and carparks closed by North Kesteven at night with warning signs applied.

Gary Lauck

Gerhard Rex Lauck (born 1953) is an American neo-Nazi activist and publisher. Based in Lincoln, Nebraska, he is sometimes nicknamed the "Farm Belt Fuehrer" due to his rural origins.
Overview.
Gary Lauck was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on May 12, 1953 to a German-American family. At age eleven, he moved to Lincoln, Nebraska with his family, his father becoming a professor of engineering at the University of Nebraska. Lauck skipped his senior year of high school and then attended the University of Nebraska for two years. By this point, he already held neo-Nazi beliefs. In 1978, he shot and wounded his brother Jerry after a political dispute. Eventually, Lauck moved to Chicago, where he would spend most of his adult life.
As leader of the NSDAP/AO he was in close contact with like-minded individuals and groups in Europe, notably Michael Kühnen with whom he worked closely from the 1970s. His contacts with the German neo-Nazi scene had begun in 1971 when as an 18 year old Lauck had established the "Auslandsorganisation" (overseas organisation) of the National Socialist Combat Groups, a militant German neo-Nazi group that was quickly banned by the German government. Lauck's NSDAP/AO was established following this ban. A noted Germanophile, Lauck sported a toothbrush moustache and used the Nazi salute as his regular greeting, whilst even speaking with an affected German accent.
Although based in the USA, Lauck spent much of time as an activist in Europe, particularly during the early 1990s when the NSDAP/AO extended its network of contacts considerably. He produced large volumes of neo-Nazi literature in several languages and also dealt in computer discs detailing the building of bombs, both of which were distributed across a network of European contacts. In 1990 he ensured that the NSDAP/AO would link up with the Swedish neo-Nazi group "Sveriges Nationella Forbund", which became instrumental in forming the "Nordic National Socialist Bloc" with like-minded activists in Norway. That same year he played a leading role in helping Kühnen, Gottfried Küssel and Christian Worch establish a network of Gesinnungsgemeinschaft der Neuen Front cells across the former East Germany following German reunification. Two years later the NSDAP/AO also concluded an agreement with the National Socialist Movement of Denmark, which up to that point had been a leading organisation within the rival World Union of National Socialists (WUNS). The change occurred after Povl Riis-Knudsen, a leading figure in WUNS, had been expelled from the Danish Nazi movement for marrying a Palestinian woman. During the early days of the Yugoslav Wars Lauck's journal "New Order" ran a series of articles in support of Croatia and in particular Ustaše and the magazine was instrumental in recruiting neo-Nazi linked mercenaries to fight for the Croatian cause.
Lauck was arrested in Denmark in 1995, leading to a far right campaign in the USA against plans to extradite him to Germany, where he was wanted for distributing neo-Nazi propaganda. Nevertheless Lauck was deported to Hamburg where he was tried and found guilty of distributing neo-Nazi pamphlets. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment.

ARTag

ARTag is a fiduciary marker system to support augmented reality. It can be used to make it easy to make virtual objects, games, and animations appear to enter the real world. Like the earlier ARToolKit system, it allows for video tracking capabilities that calculate the real camera position and orientation relative to square physical markers in real time. Once the real camera position is known a virtual camera can be positioned at the same point and 3D computer graphics models drawn exactly overlaid on the real marker. It thus addresses two of the key problems in Augmented Reality: viewpoint tracking and virtual object interaction.
An ARTag tag appears on the Mars Science Laboratory.
A similar technique is used by NASA's Spacecraft 3D smartphone app as an educational outreach tool.
ARTag is supported by the open source Goblin XNA software.

Oswald Schroeder

Oswald Schroeder (died c. 1920) was a partner in the German printers "Schroeder & Naumann" of Leipzig, who in the 1870s and 1880s produced forgeries of classic stamps so good that they found their way into the best collections of the day and in some cases formed the reference from which other forgers worked.
Schroeder forged stamps of, amongst others, India, Argentina (Buenos Aires), Saxony, Hanover, France, Finland, Philippines, Cape of Good Hope, Mexico (Guadalajara), British Guiana, Colombia and the United States. François Fournier used Schroeder's forgery of the 3pf red stamp of Saxony as the basis for his own forgery of that stamp.
In an article in The London Philatelist, Edward Denny Bacon stated that most of the large collections of that era contained Schroeder forgeries and the Tapling Collection contained no fewer than ten.
After his forgeries became well known, Schroeder fled to Zurich, Switzerland, where he is believed to have died in about 1920. Examples of his work were found in the archives of the Swiss police and formed the basis for the 1981 work by Robson Lowe.

Tropic Terrors Derby League

The Tropic Terrors Derby League (TTDL) is a roller derby league based in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Founded in 2011, the league consists of a single team, which competes against teams from other leagues.
The league was founded in January 2011 by Nidzy Moringlane de Rivera, who had become interested in the sport while in Canada, although she had not previously played. An initial meeting to establish the level of interest in forming a team attracted 33 women.
Several other leagues developed from the Tropic Terrors. Wicked Island Roller Derby League split from the Tropic Terrors in April, while the West Side Rollers, representing the west coast of the island, left later in the year, in order that it and the Tropic Terrors could each focus solely on a more coherent area.
League members played their first official bout in October 2011 alongside members of Enchanted Island Roller Derby League on an All Star Team created to compete against the Dixie Derby Girls. By early 2012, the league was practicing four times a week. In July 2012, it was accepted as a member of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association Apprentice Programme.

Doro-Chiba

History.
Doro founding.
Doro split from the National Railway Workers' Union (Kokuro) in 1951, and was considered to be more left-leaning. It was a major union, along with Kokuro, representing workers who worked for Japanese National Railways (JNR).
Doro-Chiba split from Doro.
In 1979, the Chiba Prefecture chapter of Doro split off to form an independent union, which became known as Doro-Chiba. It split off after its executive committee members had been expelled from Doro because of their support for Sanrizuka-Shibayama Union to Oppose the Airport.
November 28 1985 strike.
As of 1985, the union had 1,100 members, and on November 28, 1985, it staged a strike to protest against the plans of the Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's government to privatize JNR and lay off workers. The government strongly condemned the strike, as government workers in Japan are forbidden to strike. In addition there were a number of acts of sabotage and vandalism that stranded 10 million commuters in Tokyo and 200,000 in Osaka. The 24-hour strike caused 135 trains between Tokyo and Chiba prefecture to be cancelled, and JNR's management decided to fire more than 100 workers for staging the illegal walkout.
Middle Core Faction November 28 1985 sabotage.
In addition to the Doro-Chiba strike, a substantial amount of sabotage was done by the then-1,300 member strong radical leftist group Middle Core Faction, who claimed responsibility and said their actions were to support Doro-Chiba's strike. Communications lines were cut, fires were set at 27 locations in seven prefectures, and heavy damage was done to Asakusabashi Station in Tokyo around 7 a.m. by masked figures wearing helmets and throwing firebombs. No injuries were reported. Police raided offices of the Middle Core Faction and Doro-Chiba, and damage to bullet trail lines near Hiroshima that delayed trains between Tokyo and Kyushu appeared to have been caused by a time bomb and by noon 48 people were arrested, including leaders of the Middle Core Faction. Representatives of the larger Kokuro and Doro unions representing JNR workers condemned the "anti-social" attacks and apologized to commuters. According to sources inside the labor movement, Doro-Chiba was controlled by the Middle Core Faction.
Doro-Chiba Union Chairman Hiroshi Nakano later issued a statement saying that: "The attacks have nothing to do with the union." Of the 48 suspects arrested, 46 were from the Middle Core Faction and two were from the National Railway Workers' Union. Two of the suspects were later released.
Doro-Chiba rejection of JNR settlement.
After JNR was privatized in 1987, 1,047 workers were laid off. Unions including Kokuro, Zendoro, and Doro-Chiba waged a two-decade struggle for reinstatement of the workers. A ¥20 billion settlement was eventually paid in 2010 to 904 plaintiffs, but without the workers being reinstated.
Doro-Chiba had nine members who were not employed by JR after the privatization in 1987 and the union refused to accept the 2010 settlement. It vowed to continue the struggle against the dismissals and against the privatization of JNR.
