Peterson-Dumesnil House

The Peterson-Dumesnil House is a Victorian-Italianate house in the Crescent Hill neighborhood of Louisville, Kentucky, USA. Of the remaining large country estates built by Louisvillians in the late 19th century to the east of the city, it is the closest to Downtown Louisville, and primarily for that reason, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.
History.
The house was built on a lot in 1869 or 1870. In the post-Civil-War period, wealthy Louisvillians began to build country houses near the city, where they would spend weekends or summers, and eventually live as faster transportation to the city became available. It was originally one of several similar villa-style houses built on large lots on the south side of Frankfort Avenue, overlooking the valley through which Grinstead Drive now runs. Most as close to Downtown as the Peterson-Dumesnil house were demolished to make way for suburban residential development on small lots in the early 20th century. By 1974, only one other old estate remained in Crescent Hill, and it was irrepairibly damaged by the tornado that hit Louisville that year.
Joseph Peterson, a wealthy Louisville tobacco merchant, built the house. He was known for his contributions to Louisville architecture, as his 1889 obituary reads, he "built many of the handsome and best structures which adorn our streets". The house is believed to have been designed by local architect Henry Whitestone.
Peterson's granddaughter, Eliza Dumesnil, inherited the house and lived in it until her death in 1948. The Louisville Board of Education then purchased it and operated it as a private club for teachers, the only one of its kind in the United States, but this practice was abandoned and in 1982 the board declared it surplus, and sold the house to the Peterson-Dumesnil House Foundation.
The house is home to the Crescent Hill Community Council in the Louisville Historical League and is rented out for events such as weddings.
Architecture.
The Peterson House was built after the Civil War, circa 1869-70, in the asymmetrical Italian villa style. It is built of brick on a limestone foundation, painted white, and is two stories tall. The only major alteration to the structure is a new front porch, built sometime after 1898.
The house's Italianate facade is common in mansions of the period, and the exterior is also marked by a large cupola.

Minuscule 206 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), α 365 (Soden), is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament, partly on parchment, partly on paper (like codex 69). Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 15th century.
It has marginalia.
Formerly it was assigned by 214a and 270p. Scrivener labelled it by 182a.
Description.
The codex contains the text of the Acts of the Apostles, Pauline epistles, and Catholic epistles on 397 leaves (size ), with some lacunae (Acts 1:1-12:3; 13:5-15(?); 2 John-Jude). The text is written in 1 column per page, 20 lines per page. The order of books: Acts of the Apostles, Catholic epistles, and Pauline epistles.
It has some additional matter, like Journeys of Paul (as Minuscule 102, 216, 256, 468, 614, 665, 909, 912). 
The text is divided according to the ("chapters"), whose numbers are given at the margin.
It contains Prolegomena, tables of the ("tables of contents") before each book, lectionary markings at the margin, Synaxarion, and Menologion, and subscriptions at the end of each book.
2 John, 3 John, and Epistle Jude were supplied in the 14th century.
Text.
The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Caesarean text-type in the Catholic epistles and the Byzantine text-type in rest of the books of the codex. Aland placed it in Category III in the Catholic epistles, and in Category V in rest of books.
In the Pauline epistles text is close to the codices 429, 522, 1891, and 2815.
In 2 Timothy 2:14 it reads Χριστου ("of Christ") for θεοῦ ("of God") along with 429, 1758.
History.
The manuscript was brought by Carlyle from a Greek island to England (along with minuscule 470). 
It was examined and described by Scrivener. 
Formerly it was assigned by 214a and 270p. In 1908 C. R. Gregory gave number 206 for it.
Formerly it was housed at the Lambeth Palace. It is currently housed at the Antiquariat Christi (1182), in London.

Adoration of the Magi (Velázquez)

The Adoration of the Magi is a 1619 Baroque painting by the Spanish artist Diego Velázquez now held in the Museo del Prado. It shows three kings presenting gifts to the Christ child: Melchoir, who kneels in the foreground; Balthazar, who stands behind him wearing a red cape and a lace collar; and Caspar, who appears between the other two. An unidentified young man who stands behind Balthazar is looking on. Kneeling near the Virgin's left shoulder is Saint Joseph. The size and format of the painting indicate that it was made for an altarpiece.
History.
The earliest record of this painting is from about 1764, when it was in the Jesuit Novitiate of San Luis, Seville. It was given by Ferdinand VII to the Museo del Prado in 1819.

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder associated with problems of movement, memory, and the autonomic nervous system. It is related to the disease fragile X syndrome, although FXTAS is a clinically distinct syndrome. In fragile X syndrome (FXS),the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene, FMR1, is silenced; in FXTAS FMR1 is overexpressed and interferes with brain function.
Both FXS and FXTAS are caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in FMR1. This CGG repeat expansion is smaller in FXTAS: the disease only occurs in individuals with a Fragile X premutation. It most often occurs in men, but can present in women. There is no cure for FXTAS, but several of the symptoms can be managed with medication.
Symptoms.
The physical symptoms of FXTAS include an intention tremor, ataxia, and parkinsonism. This includes small, shuffling steps, muscle rigidity and slowed speech, as well as neuropathic symptoms. As the disease progresses to the more advanced stages, an individual with FXTAS is also at risk of autonomic dysfunction: hypertension, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and impotence. 
An individual with FXTAS may also exhibit the following symptoms: a decrease in cognition, which includes diminishing short-term memory and executive function skills, declining math and spelling abilities and decision-making abilities. FXTAS may also result in changes in personality, due to alterations of the limbic area in the brain. This includes increased irritability, angry outbursts, and impulsive behaviour
Prognosis and Medical Management.
The progression of symptoms varies widely between each case of FXTAS; the onset of symptoms may be gradual, with progression of the disease spanning multiple years or decades. Alternatively, symptoms may progress rapidly. 
The medical management of FXTAS aims to reduce the level of disability and minimize symptoms. Presently, there are many gaps in the research on the management of FXTAS, as the disorder was first described in the literature in 2001. There is no treatment modality aimed at reversing the pathogenesis of FXTAS. However, there are a variety of drug therapies that are being utilized in the management of FXTAS symptoms, although there is a lack of randomized control trials assessing the efficacy these therapies and support is limited to anecdotal evidence. Therefore many of the treatments are based on what has been helpful in disorders with similar clinical presentations

Soybean aphid

The soybean aphid ("Aphis glycines" Matsumura) is an insect pest of soybean ("Glycine max" (L.) Merr.) that is exotic to North America. The soybean aphid is native to Asia. It has been described as a common pest of soybeans in China and as an occasional pest of soybeans in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. The soybean aphid was first documented in North America in Wisconsin in July 2000. Ragsdale "et al." (2004) noted that the soybean aphid probably arrived in North America earlier than 2000, but remained undetected for a period of time. Venette and Ragsdale (2004) suggested that Japan probably served as the point of origin for the soybean aphid’s North American invasion. By 2003, the soybean aphid had been documented in Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Together, these states accounted for 89% of the of soybean planted in the United States in 2007.
Life history.
The soybean aphid possesses a heteroecious holocyclic life cycle, which means the insect alternates hosts and undergoes sexual reproduction for at least part of its life cycle. Soybean aphids overwinter as eggs on their primary hosts, buckthorn ("Rhamnus" spp.). Eggs can be located near buds or within crevices of branches. With a mean supercooling point of , eggs are well-adapted for surviving cold winters.
In two studies, the quantity of overwintering eggs had a strong positive correlation with the severity of soybean aphid outbreaks in the following spring.
Eggs begin to hatch into fundatrices when temperatures in the spring reach . Colonization of buckthorn by soybean aphids in the spring can lead to curling of leaves and twigs. Near the blooming stage of buckthorn, fundatrices reproduce parthenogenetically to give viviparous birth to alatae. These winged soybean aphids begin the spring migration to their secondary host, soybean. Soybean aphids go through approximately 15 generations on soybean, all of which are primarily composed of apterous females produced through viviparous parthenogenesis. Each generation passes through 4 instars and can range from 2 to 16 days in length, with lower temperatures increasing development and decreasing generation time.
Feeding by soybean aphids injures soybean by interfering with photosynthetic pathways—more specifically, biological mechanisms responsible for restoring chlorophyll to a low energy state are impaired. This restoration process is known as quenching and is important for plants to execute light reactions properly. Reduction in photosynthetic capacity of soybean may occur before plants begin to display symptoms of injury.
Infestation of soybean aphids on soybean can be classified into three stages. The first stage occurs when alatae migrate to soybean in late May and early June. During this stage, small colonies of soybean aphids appear patchy, occurring on single plants scattered throughout a field. In these early colonies, soybean aphids are typically grouped on tender, young leaves of soybean plants. As the infested plant ages, soybean aphids remain on leaves near the top of the plant. Studies have demonstrated a positive correlation exists between upper leaf nitrogen content of soybean and the occurrence of soybean aphids. Damage to a soybean plant during this initial stage is a result of stylet-feeding and can include curling and stunting of leaves and twigs, physiological delays, and underdevelopment of root tissue. However, the relatively low densities of soybean aphids during this stage have been found to have minimal impacts on soybean yield.
The second stage, or pre-peak stage, can begin as early as late June and is characterized by dramatic increases in densities of soybean aphids. As colonies expand and temperatures increase, soybean aphids move toward lower portions of the soybean plant. The optimal temperature for soybean aphid development occurs between 25 and 30 °C, and exposure to prolonged temperatures of decrease survival rates and fecundity of soybean aphids. Extremely high population growth rates can be achieved under optimal conditions, with a colony doubling in size in as few as 1.3 days.
The final stage of infestation by soybean aphids on soybean, or peak stage, begins in mid- to late July and is characterized by very high densities of soybean aphids. As populations grow during this stage, plant damage may become severe. Heavy infestations of soybean aphids may cause plant stunting, distorted foliage, premature defoliation, stunted stems and leaves, reduced branch, pod, and seed numbers, lower seed weight, and underdevelopment of root tissue. Yield losses as high as 50 to 70% have been documented as a result of prolonged exposure to high densities of soybean aphids.
When populations of soybean aphids increase, a need arises for apterae to produce alate offspring to seek out new hosts. This can be due to both deteriorating host plant quality and crowding effects. Crowding of nymphal apterae will not cause them to develop into alate adults. Crowding effects on alatae can induce alate offspring production as well, although alatae are not as sensitive to crowding as apterae. Soybean plants are prevented from becoming super-saturated by emigration of soybean aphids through alate production, which serves to maintain an equilibrium density of soybean aphids. Decreased body size and lowered fecundity can be induced in soybean aphids when populations reach very high densities.
As host plant quality begins to deteriorate in late August and early September, soybean aphids take on a paler color and experience decreased growth and reproductive rates. High densities of soybean aphids during these late plant stages have less of a significant negative impact on soybean yield. During this period of declining temperatures and decreasing rainfall, soybean plants undergo senescence gradually from bottom to top, causing an upward movement of soybean aphids to higher plant tissue.
After going through approximately 15 generations on soybean, soybean aphids begin to transition back to their primary host, buckthorn. A generation of winged females, gynoparae, develop on soybean and leave for buckthorn when mature. Simultaneously, an apterous population of soybean aphids remains on soybean to produce alate male sexual morphs. Factors that positively affect the production of gynoparae and male alatae include declining host plant quality, shortened day length, and lowered temperatures.
While on buckthorn, gynoparae produce a generation of apterous female sexual morphs (oviparae) that mate with male alatae to produce overwintering eggs. As buckthorn experiences increased feeding pressure by oviparae, volatile emissions from the plant are significantly decreased, possibly serving as a defense mechanism to inhibit further colonization by soybean aphids. Male alatae locate oviparae on buckthorn through two sex pheromones commonly found in aphid species, (1"R",4a"S",7"S",7a"R")-nepetalactol and (4a"S",7"S",7a"R")-nepetalactone, that are emitted by oviparae in a species-specific combination. After mating on buckthorn, oviparae deposit their eggs on the plant. Ragsdale "et al." (2004) proposed that movement from soybean to buckthorn may produce a bottleneck effect that inhibits the ability of soybean aphids to overwinter in great numbers.
Host plant biology.
More than 100 species of "Rhamnus" exist worldwide, and most of these species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. "Rhamnus" species are plentiful in North America. Two confirmed "Rhamnus" species that support overwintering of soybean aphids in North America are common buckthorn ("Rhamnus cathartica") of exotic origin and alderleaf buckthorn ("Rhamnus alnifolia") of native origin. Another widespread "Rhamnus" species of exotic origin in North America is alder buckthorn ("Rhamnus frangula"); however, neither mature oviparae nor eggs have been documented on this potential host.
In an experiment to determine alternate primary hosts for soybean aphids, only members of the genus "Rhamnus" were able to support development of soybean aphids. In Asia, where the soybean aphid is native, dominant primary hosts include Japanese buckthorn ("Rhamnus japonica") and Dahurian buckthorn ("Rhamnus davurica"). One study indicated certain plant species may play a role in bridging colonization of soybean from buckthorn. One such species that is readily available in early spring is red clover ("Trifolium pratense"). An experiment further reinforced this relationship by demonstrating that soybean aphids can develop on red clover in a laboratory setting.
The most common secondary host in both Asia and North America for soybean aphids is soybean. Soybean has been cultivated in Asia for 4,000 to 5,000 years and in the United States since 1904. Du "et al." (1994) demonstrated that the primary method by which soybean aphids locate soybean is through olfactory chemical signaling. Interference by non-host odors diminished the ability of soybean aphids to locate and colonize soybean.
Deleterious effects of soybean aphids on soybean can be highly variable and are influenced by factors like soybean aphid density, plant stage, plant density, and temperature. In addition, soil nutrient conditions within a soybean field may play some role in the development of infestations of soybean aphids. For example, in a laboratory experiment, soybean aphids that fed on potassium-deficient soybean experienced increased fecundity and survivorship. Field experiments failed to corroborate this finding. Myers "et al." (2005a) hypothesized that potassium-stress in the laboratory may lead to increased nitrogen availability for soybean aphids. Yield data taken from this experiment showed that potassium-stress in conjunction with infestation by soybean aphids caused significant yield loss.
Specificity for soybean aphids to feed on soybean has been demonstrated by Han and Yan (1995) in an experiment utilizing an electrical penetration graph. While no difference in the amount of time spent probing between soybean and other non-host plants was observed, the ingestion of phloem by soybean aphids was either greatly reduced or did not happen at all on non-host plants. Nevertheless, some alternate secondary hosts have been observed for soybean aphids. The most widespread of these alternate secondary hosts is wild soybean ("Glycine soja"), which has been known to support colonies of soybean aphids in Asia. In Korea and the Philippines, kudzu ("Pueraria montana") and tropical kudzu ("Pueraria javanica") have been described as alternate secondary hosts, respectively.
Virus transmission.
Soybean aphids may indirectly affect plant health through viral transmission. Viruses spread by soybean aphids are typically vectored non-persistently, which allows for disease transmission in the first moments of stylet penetration. Non-persistent transmission does not limit viruses vectored by soybean aphids to soybean, but rather to any plant that alate soybean aphids contact and probe with their stylets for a brief period of time. Unlike stationary apterae, only alatae have been shown to transmit viruses between plants. Incidence of non-persistently transmitted viruses has been shown to increase when flight activity of the vector is high, leading to the belief that the risk of virus transmission by soybean aphids may increase during times of high dispersal, such as the end of the peak stage.
In China, the most important virus vectored by the soybean aphid is "Soybean mosaic virus", which can cause yield loss and decreased seed quality. This virus is also found in North America and has been demonstrated as being vectored by the soybean aphid in field studies. In addition to "Soybean mosaic virus", the soybean aphid is capable of transmitting "Soybean stunt virus", "Soybean dwarf virus", "Abaca mosaic virus", "Alfalfa mosaic virus", "Beet mosaic virus", "Tobacco vein-banding virus", "Tobacco ringspot virus", "Bean yellow mosaic virus", "Mungbean mosaic virus", "Peanut mottle virus", "Peanut stripe poty virus", and "Peanut mosaic virus".
Host plant resistance.
Several varieties of soybean have demonstrated resistance to the soybean aphid. Resistance may be conferred by antibiosis, antixenosis, or tolerance. In some instances, such as with the soybean cultivars 'Dowling', 'Jackson', and 'Palmetto', resistance to the soybean aphid results from a combination of both antibiosis and antixenosis. In the 'Dowling' cultivar, resistance is conferred by a single dominant gene ("Rag"1). Soybean plants that are resistant to the soybean aphid can cause both reduced fecundity and longevity in soybean aphids. In the case of antibiosis, certain life stages of the soybean aphid may be more susceptible than others. For example, nymphs have higher rates of metabolism than other life stages, ingest more phloem, and are thus exposed to larger quantities of antibiotic compounds. Expression of antibiotic factors in resistant soybean plants that negatively affect soybean aphids has been shown to remain constant throughout the growing season, remaining unaffected by the physiological maturity of the plant. Colonization of resistant soybean cultivars can vary between years depending upon the level of infestation, with resistant plants showing lower levels of resistance in years with significant levels of soybean aphid infestation. Physical characteristics of soybean, such as dense pubescence, have thus far proven incapable of reducing colonization by soybean aphids.
Natural enemies.
In Asia, the soybean aphid experiences pressure from over 30 species of predators, 8 species of parasitoids, and some fungal pathogens. In Indonesia, where the soybean aphid is considered an occasional pest, evidence indicates the use of insecticides to control soybean aphids may not always be necessary due to suppression of the insect to subeconomic densities by natural enemies alone. In North America, the dominant natural enemies in soybean are generalist predators. Exclusion cage experiments have provided evidence that predators can play an important role in suppression of the soybean aphid. Impacts from predators include both the ability to suppress colony establishment early in the season as well as respond to increased densities of soybean aphids late in the season.
One of the most important predators of soybean aphids in North America is the insidious flower bug ("Orius insidiosus" (Say)). The insidious flower bug has its greatest impact on early to mid-season populations of soybean aphids and is often able to keep soybean aphid densities low. Fox "et al." (2004) hypothesized that the impact from this predator early in the season could be attributed to small plant size and sparse canopies, which aid the insidious flower bug by reducing foraging time and decreasing the number of places soybean aphids can hide (i.e., enemy-free space). In addition, synomones released by soybean after being colonized by soybean aphids may aid the insidious flower bug in host location. When populations of soybean aphids reach very high densities, top-down pressure exerted by the insidious flower bug may fail to suppress colony growth of soybean aphids.
Another group of predators that plays a key role in suppression of populations of soybean aphids in North America is lady beetles (Coccinellidae spp.). Some prevalent species in soybean include the twospotted lady beetle ("Adalia bipunctata" L.), the sevenspotted lady beetle ("Coccinella septempunctata" L.), the spotted lady beetle ("Coleomegilla maculata" De Geer), the polished lady beetle ("Cycloneda munda" (Say)), the multicolored Asian lady beetle ("Harmonia axyridis" (Pallas)), the convergent lady beetle ("Hippodamia convergens" Guérin-Méneville), and the thirteen spotted lady beetle ("Hippodamia tredecimpunctata" L.).
Evidence suggests that populations of lady beetles can respond to increases in populations of soybean aphids in soybean. In addition, increases in populations of lady beetles have the ability to inhibit colony growth of soybean aphids throughout the growing season. As generalist predators, lady beetles are able to feed on alternate prey when soybean aphids are at low densities. Other characteristics of lady beetles that are advantageous in times of soybean aphid scarcity include developmental delays of certain life stages, decreased body weights, and reduced clutch sizes. One of the most competitive lady beetles in North America, the multicolored Asian lady beetle, is of exotic origin. When soybean aphids are plentiful, an adult multicolored Asian lady beetle has the capacity to consume 160 soybean aphids per day.
Other foliar-foraging predators that are present North American soybean fields that may play a role in suppression of soybean aphid populations include green lacewings ("Chrysoperla" spp.), brown lacewings ("Hemerobius" spp.), damsel bugs ("Nabis" spp.), big eyed bugs ("Geocoris" spp.), spined soldier bugs ("Podisus maculiventris" (Say)), hover flies (Syrphidae spp.), and the aphid midge ("Aphidoletes aphidimyza" (Rondani)). Another group of predators that are present in soybean fields is ground beetles (Carabidae spp.); however, field experiments have shown limited to no impact from these predators on populations of soybean aphids due to the fact that ground beetles rarely scale soybean plants for prey. While parasitoids of the soybean aphid have a large impact on colonies in Asia—"Lysiphlebia japonica" (Ashmead) can have a soybean aphid parasitism rate as high as 52.6% in China—parasitoids are thought to exert only minimal pressure on soybean aphids in North America.
Management.
The use of insecticides to control populations of soybean aphids in soybean is the most effective management tactic in North America. Insecticides available to soybean producers for controlling soybean aphids include both foliar-applied treatments and seed-applied treatments. Although seed-applied treatments have proven to be a convenient delivery method for insect control, studies have experienced inconsistent results regarding their efficacy against the soybean aphid. Management decisions should be made with an understanding of soybean aphid life history and sound scouting practices rooted in the principles of integrated pest management.
The current economic threshold for soybean aphids states that an insecticide application is warranted when soybean aphid densities reach 250 soybean aphids per plant, 80% of sampled plants are infested, the population is currently increasing, and few natural enemies are observed in the field. This recommendation is only valid from the R1 (beginning bloom) to R5 (beginning seed) growth stages and is based on an economic injury level of 674 soybean aphids per plant. Due to the clumped spatial distribution of soybean aphids, Onstad "et al." (2005) recommend that 50 plants should be sampled within a field to attain an accurate representation of densities of soybean aphids. Soybean producers can choose from a variety of foliar insecticides from the carbamate, pyrethroid, and organophosphate chemical families to control soybean aphids.
Evidence indicates that foliar insecticide applications can reduce symptoms associated with soybean aphid infestations, including curled leaves, shortened stems, stunted plants, and premature defoliation. Foliar insecticide applications can also prevent yield loss associated with high densities of soybean aphids. However, some risks are associated with the use of foliar insecticide applications, especially if integrated pest management principles are abandoned. A single, well-timed application may not sufficiently control soybean aphids and prevent yield loss, especially if large quantities of soybean aphids are surviving on lower leaves. Foliar insecticide applications can work detrimentally if nontarget effects are experienced, such as the unintended death of beneficial natural enemies.

I'm Your Captain (Closer to Home)

"I'm Your Captain (Closer to Home)" is an epic 1970 song written by American musician Mark Farner and recorded by Grand Funk Railroad as the closing track to their album "Closer to Home". Ten minutes in duration, it is the band's longest studio recording. One of the group's best-known songs, it is composed as two distinct but closely related movements. Its title has been rendered in various ways across many different Grand Funk albums, including "I'm Your Captain", "I'm Your Captain/Closer to Home", "Closer to Home/I'm Your Captain", "Closer to Home (I'm Your Captain)", and "Closer to Home".
The song conveys the pleas of a captain on a troubled sea voyage and facing a mutiny from his crew. Its use of an orchestra during the long repeated refrains of the closing movement served to differentiate it from much of Grand Funk's work. Several interpretations of the song have been given; most revolve around the Vietnam War, and "I'm Your Captain" is popular among veterans of that conflict. The record was a modest hit single when first released, but achieved greater airplay on progressive rock radio stations. It has become a classic rock staple and has appeared on several audience-selected lists as one of the best rock songs of all time.
Writing and recording.
The song is composed in the compound binary form that was most popular, and used for several well-known songs, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The first movement opens with an electric guitar riff from Farner, which aspiring young guitarists of the time learned to imitate. This soon changes into a strummed acoustic guitar paired with a distinctive lead bass line from Mel Schacher, set against a steady drumbeat from Don Brewer accompanied with occasional wah wah guitar flourishes. The chord changes go from D to G to G6/C.
The story ostensibly deals with a ship's captain on a troubled voyage and facing a mutiny from his crew. Farner's vocal of the pleading lyric begins:
The music has a bass break and then drops down to half time before resuming at its normal tempo. The protagonist's plight becomes worse, with the captain's pleas continuing while the unhappy crew members are approaching the point of murder.
At the 4½-minute mark the song switches to the second movement, which begins with the sounds of waves and gulls. The captain's voice is tinged with a sense of hopeless longing, perhaps even indicating that it is his ghost now singing:
Again the bass line carries the music, with now a flute line accompanying it. Soon the strings from the orchestra, make their entrance, featuring violins, violas, cellos, and basses. The second movement starts at a fairly slow tempo, before speeding up somewhat into its repeats. The significant chord progression in this part is from C to B♭add9. The movement's single lyric repeats over and over as a mantra, in the style of Van Morrison. Around the 7-minute mark a full orchestra appears to accompany the band to the gradually fading conclusion.
Unusually for him, Farner wrote the lyric of the song first, with the words coming to him in the middle of the night after saying prayers for inspiration to write something meaningful. The chord changes to "I'm Your Captain" came to him the following morning between sips of coffee, and the following day he took it to the band. They immediately liked it, but after a while had no ending for the second movement. They came upon the idea of using an orchestra, and hired Tommy Baker, an arranger and trumpet player who was working on the Cleveland television series "Upbeat". He suggested they extend the ending so that his orchestral score would have space to develop in, and producer Terry Knight brought in the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra to record it. The band members never heard the full version until Knight played it for them back in hometown Flint, Michigan. Farner nearly cried when he heard it, and Brewer has said "We were just like, 'Wow!'"
Reception.
Released as a single with the title "Closer To Home", it was modestly successful in early fall 1970, reaching number 22 on the U.S. pop singles chart as the group's first top 40 hit single. It was far more successful on progressive rock radio stations, such as those in New York, where its length and epic feel were an asset and where it became a mainstay that appealed to a broad spectrum of rock fans outside Grand Funk's immediate listener base. Its airplay helped the album reach the Top 10 of the U.S. albums chart within a month of its release.
Decades later, "I'm Your Captain" remains a staple of many classic rock radio stations. It is considered to be the standout track on the "Closer to Home" album and by both Farner and others to be his best work as a songwriter. And with its melodic strengths and dramatic feel it is often considered one of the best rock songs of all time; in 1988, the listeners of legendary New York rock station WNEW-FM ranked it the 71st best song of all time, while twenty years later in 2008, New York classic rock station Q104.3's listeners still ranked it the 112th best song of all time.
Grand Funk Railroad were consistently despised by the rock critic establishment, and "I'm Your Captain" got some of the same treatment. In the 1979 "Rolling Stone Record Guide", critic Dave Marsh relented only slightly by writing, "Wretched was the word to describe Grand Funk's music. Although the group occasionally achieve an interesting song—'I'm Your Captain' was about the best of the early ones ..."
Themes and interpretations.
Over the years many interpretations have been posed by listeners of "I'm Your Captain", including the literal one of mutiny on a voyage, but also ones involving drug addiction and ones by those who see resonance in Homer's "Odyssey" and themes of returning home, such as college students returning from a long semester. Authors have seen the song as an "epic of paranoia and disease" and as a tale of a man who had lost control of his life in a fashion strong enough to invoke childhood nightmares. It has been used as the subtitle for a chapter of a novel dealing with war and addictions. Comparisons have been made to Walt Whitman's poem "O Captain! My Captain!" in its use of the rank to mean Abraham Lincoln.
Farner himself does not explicitly state what the song is about, and indeed prefers that listeners be able to use their own imaginations when listening to songs in general. But the most common interpretations and resonances of "I'm Your Captain" revolve around the Vietnam War. VH1's "Behind the Music" said the song "became a subtle anti-war anthem". Lee Andresen, author of "Battle Notes: Music of the Vietnam War", sees it as portraying President Richard Nixon as "captain" of the United States, losing popular support for continuing the war. Fellow Flint native Michael Moore remembers hearing it on the radio the day he went to his draft board (where he would file as a conscientious objector), and hoping the "I'm getting closer to my home" refrains would never end, as he felt America was his home and not Vietnam.
The song found a following too among American personnel in Vietnam, in part because the band's working-class Flint origins were similar to those of many Americans serving in the war. It resonated with them as they tried to stay alive while waiting for the time when they could get closer to home, and then when they were finally returning from the war. It remains quite popular among Vietnam veterans and Farner has played it at several veterans' benefits. Farner visited and performed at The Wall in November 2007, on the 25th anniversary of the memorial's dedication. He later said, "The gig was a great spiritual and emotional experience. The 'Nam vets I had the privilege to speak to were so gracious and personal with me, as if we were relatives getting back together after a long time apart. As you could imagine, it was really hard for me to sing 'I'm Your Captain' because there was a softball stuck in my throat and I couldn't swallow it!" In 2010, Farner sang the song accompanying himself on acoustic guitar at the Vietnam Veterans of America's National Leadership Conference, where he received the organization's President's Award for Excellence in the Arts.
Later appearances.
The song has been included on many Grand Funk live albums and compilations since it first appeared, including 1971's ', 1975's "Caught in the Act", 1991's "Capitol Collectors Series", 1997's "Bosnia", ', 2002's "Classic Masters", a bonus track on the 2002 CD reissue of 1971's "E Pluribus Funk", the archival "", and 2006's "Greatest Hits".
The song has been a staple of Farner concert performances in the decades since its recording, with the younger generation of concert-goers still knowing all the words. It received standing ovations when Farner played it as part of the third edition of Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band in 1995, and a similar reaction greeted it during the 1996 reunion tour of Grand Funk Railroad.
The song has been recorded by the German power metal band Helloween as a track on their 1995 CD single "Sole Survivor". Perhaps the most unusual 'performance' of it was an improvised one with altered lyrics by an American Airlines pilot over a plane's PA system while awaiting permission to leave the gate. This performance too drew much applause.
American radio personality Mark Thompson said in 1999 that the song "will be played for the rest of time." Producer Terry Knight said in 2003 of the song, "I'm humbled by my part in that piece of history. 'Closer to Home' will never die, it'll be around forever." Farner said in 2007, "It’s just one of those songs. It fit. Everything about it worked for that time and it still works today."

The Farmers' Lunch

"The Farmers' Lunch" ("Almuerzo de campesinos") is one of the earliest paintings by the Spanish artist Diego Velázquez. Painted in oil on canvas in 1618, it combines a still life of food and drink with a depiction of three comic farmers, whose physiognomy the artist studies closely. The composition shows a younger man gesturing with his right hand to reinforce the story coming from his half-open lips, and an older man listening attentively while holding his cup up to a woman so she can refill it with wine. The still life includes fish, bread, a carrot, a lemon, and a copper vessel.
"The Farmer's Lunch" is nearly identical to another painting by Velázquez, "The Lunch" (ca. 1617).

Teklogix

Teklogix (more fully, Teklogix International Inc.) was created in 1967 by Lawrence Cragg together with a small group of engineers.The company focused on mini computer applications. It designed and built complete systems based upon DEC's PDP-8 computer, DEC's logic modules and purpose built logic. Many of the company's projects involved control of material handling systems and this led to the development of radio linked terminals for installation on fork lift trucks complete with multiplexers to interface to a variety of main frame computer systems.
In September 2000 Teklogix was acquired by U.K.-based Psion PLC, and became Psion Teklogix Inc.
The Founders.
The founders are: Rod Coutts, Lawrie Cragg, Al Vanderburgh, Cliff Bernard and Pete Halsall. Lawrie Cragg ran the company as President for the first nine years of its life.
The group met while working at Ferranti International's Canadian division, Ferranti-Packard Electronics. The engineers worked on projects related to FP6000 (Ferranti-Packard 6000, which became the ICL 1900), ReserVec, Back Up Interceptor Control (BUIC) for the United States Military, as well as Ferranti-Packard's drum memory systems. The group left Ferranti-Packard and formed Teklogix.
History.
1967 - on September 20, Teklogix was formed by a group of 5 engineers. The first contract came from I. P. Sharp Associates (another Ferranti offspring) that involved the interface of a DEC PDP-8 computer to an X-ray spectrometer. The system controlled reagent feeders in a copper and zinc floatation mill. The objective was to analyze the mine head (i.e. what was coming out of the mine) using on-line X-ray spectroscopy and, then, using mathematical algorithms developed by University of Toronto, add the appropriate amounts of reagent to optimize mineral recovery.
1972 - Teklogix was awarded a contract from Canada Post to control a tilt-tray mail sorter system. The company went on to be a primary supplier of sortation and conveyor control systems for the next decade.
1980 - Teklogix introduced wireless real-time data collection solutions.
1981 - Company is awarded a contract with U.S. Defense General Supply Agency (DGSC) to develop a real-time on-board pick information system for 37 Raymond pick vehicles.

The triplets, all boys with blond hair, live in Sweden and have light hearted misadventures. The series of books were first created in the 1920s in Sweden and then printed in English in the United States from the 1930s. A 1936 New York Times review of the book "Snipp Snapp Snurr and the Yellow Sled" cited the Snipp, Snapp, Snurr series as "popular with the little children".
The series of books continued until about 1960. Lindman also produced a series of books about triplet girls names Flicka Ricka and Dicka. Some of Lindman's stories were included in a series of compilations called "The Best of Children's Books".

Battle of Buin

The Battle of Buin was fought on January 6, 1839, during the Chilean second expedition of the War of the Confederation. The Restoring Army rearguard led by General Manuel Bulnes successfully held the bridge over the Buin River in the North Peruvian territory from the attack of the Confederacy Army commanded by Marshal Andres de Santa Cruz, yet retreated to San Miguel leaving the field before Santa Cruz could engage him again. 
Both countries consider this action as a victory. In Chile, a regiment was named "Buin" 1st Line Regiment on 1851, in commemoration of the soldiers who fought and died in this encounter. This Unit still preserves its name.
Prologue.
South America had been in turmoil since the War of the Confederation broke out on 1837. Chile, feeling threatened by Andres de Santa Cruz' growing influence in the continent and his intentions to create a Peru-Bolivian Confederacy, declared war on 1837. Chile sent an expedition under Manuel Blanco Encalada, but the latter failed in his task, and surrounded and outnumbered at Arequipa was forced to sign the "Treaty of Paucarpata" on November 17, compromising to resume trade relations with the Confederacy. This treaty was widely rejected by the Chilean government and public opinion, so a new expedition was sent, led this time by General Manuel Bulnes Prieto, a veteran from revolutionary wars during Jose Joaquin Prieto's Presidency.
Restoring Army.
The army assembled by Chile for the second expedition was formed by seven infantry battalions, two cavalry regiments, plus six artillery pieces; having a nominal strength of 5,400 men.
Confederate Army.
Santa Cruz' army was strong in about 6,000 men divided into four Corps, made up by Peruvians and Bolivians, all veterans of internal wars in their respective countries.
Preliminary moves.
The Restoring Army lands at Ancon on August 7, 1838. Bulnes believed that Orbegoso had abandoned the Confederacy, but the latter refused to authorize Bulnes' forces disembark. This tense situation led to a confrontation and a subsequent engagement at Portada de Guias on August 21, where Bulnes obtains his first victory in this campaign and enters in Peru's capital city. Four days later, Peruvian Marshal Agustin Gamarra is appointed as a provisional President of Peru. 
This caused Santa Cruz to march over Lima. In the ensuing combat of Matucana, Bulnes results triumphant again. This setback diminishes Santa Cruz' army morale. Before these events, General Brown had defeated the bulk of the Argentinean Army at the Battle of Montenegro on June 24, 1838. On November 12, General Heredia is assassinated, ending the participation of Argentina in the war. 
With the army decimated by deceases, the lack of discipline of the newly added Peruvian troops under Agustin Gamarra, and surrounded and beset by "montoneros", a council decides to leave Lima on November 8. General Moran enters Lima the very next day. 
The restoring plan consists in to leave Lima and move north, trying to avoid a direct confrontation with outnumbering Santa Cruz' army. Once arrived to Huacho on the 13, the sick and the wounded are sent to Trujillo and Piura, along with the poor trained Peruvian soldiers, while the rest of the army are to occupy the Huaylas Corridor, where the chances of gaining tactical advantages are stronger. During this march, a detachment of the Restoring Army under Juan Colipi contain a major confederate force at Llaclla on December 18 
On January 5, Bulnes is almost surprised at Huaraz, retreating from the town but forced to detain on the northern edge of the Buin River and present battle.
The battle.
Since a storm broke out before the battle, the Buin became impossible to cross in any point but by the bridge over there. Thus, this bridge became the strategic goal for both armies.
Battle formations.
Bulnes deployed Colonel Valenzuela's Carampangue Battalion on the centre, with Gomez' Valdivia Battalion on the right flank and Garcia's Portales Battalion on the left. The skirmishers of the first unit were to guard the bridge over the river and to keep it from falling on confederate hands
Santa Cruz formed his army over the road, with Moran's division on the rear with the rest of the army; all the skirmishers were set on a nearby height and two cannons under Colonel Pareja were aiming the bridge.
The beginning.
With this positioning, the battle broke out at 15:30 hrs. When Gomez began to form his unit over the shore, Pareja opened fire upon the restoring centre. With both armies separated by the river, Santa Cruz' efforts logically focused on the bridge, but he was contained. This sector of the battlefield witnessed heavy action since the bridge was the key of victory for both sides. Also a detachment of soldiers, exhausted for the march were cut by a group of confederate troops trying to surrender them. Hence, the Portales advanced to defend them, successfully taking the company out of their difficult situation. 
After an intense infantry and artillery fire, Santa Cruz ordered Moran and Guilarte to engage the enemy from different directions. General Guarda with his light division assaulted the bridge, but his column was caught by the Chilean infantry fire, falling Guarda severely wounded and forcing him to retreat. Whilst, Moran frontally charged the Carampangue Battalion, while Guilarte forwarded against Garcia's position on the restoring right flank. Then, Moran's division advanced over the bridge as well, but he was rejected too. 
Around the bridge the fight was pretty vicious. A detachment from all the restoring units were defending the position under Lt. Colipi, who being surrounded charged repeatedly against their enemy. The Bolivian Captain Juan Jose Perez with a company of the Cazadores Nº 2 Battalion, threw himself with a few soldiers to the river trying to cross it, but almost all of his men drowned. Also, a few soldiers could reach the other shore under the command of Captain Leuper, but was forced to retreat, resuming the fire from both sides of the river.
The fight continued with an intense infantry cross fire, but nobody could obtain any advantages. Meanwhile, Bulnes' vanguard undid its advance trying to reach the battle in time. Vidaurre-Leal's Valparaiso Battalion was the first one to get to the battlefield, arriving on the afternoon. Fore seeking the proximity of both armies and the arrival of his vanguard would force a general battle, Bulnes ordered Valenzuela to move to the rear, and ordered Vidaurre-Leal to advance to the front line, taking the place of the Valdivia Battalion, which exhausted all of its ammunition. 
The confederate army was rejected once again and forced to return to Huauyan. When the Colchagua Battalion arrived, it couldn't engage because after the confederates retreated, Lieutenant Juan Colipi destroyed the bridge, following an order existing since Huacho to destroy anything that could help the advance of the confederate army.
With the bridge cut, both armies limited to fire upon each other from their respective positions. Having his vanguard Commander injured, Santa Cruz could not take advantage of this new positioning. He also did not allow Moran to attack the restoring troops when they were crossing the creek.
Afterwards, the storm broke out again. When it stopped around 20:00 hrs, a confederate column crossed the river to scout the position, but Bulnes had already left towards San Miguel.
Aftermath.
Bulnes lost almost 300 men between dead and wounded, while Santa Cruz had almost 70 casualties. This battle had no decisive effects on the war development. Both commanders continued their respective plans, Bulnes moving north avoiding an engagement were the superior number of Santa Cruz' army were determinant, and Santa Cruz trying to chase down Bulnes and force him into a decisive battle. This situation continued until January 20, when at Yungay Bulnes defeated decisively the confederate army, vanquishing the Peru Bolivian Confederacy forever.

Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery

In 1992 the Canadian government declared a moratorium on the Northern Cod fishery, which for the past 500 years had largely shaped the lives and communities of Canada's eastern coast. The interplay between fishing societies and the resources which they depend on is obvious to almost any observer: fisheries transform the ecosystem, which pushes the fishery and society to adapt. In 1992 summer, when the Northern Cod biomass fell to 1% of its earlier level, Canada's federal government saw that this relationship had been pushed to breaking point, and they declared a moratorium, ending the region's 500-year run with the Northern Cod.
Causes of the collapse.
Academics have highlighted these three contributing factors in the eventual collapse of the cod fishery.
Technological.
A major factor that contributed to the depletion of the cod stocks off the shores of Newfoundland included the introduction and proliferation of equipment and technology that increased the volume of landed fish. For centuries local fishermen used technology that limited the volume of their catch, the area they fished, and let them target specific species and ages of fish. From the 1950s onwards, as was common in all industries at the time, new technology was introduced that allowed fishermen to trawl a larger area, fish to a deeper depth and for a longer time. By the 1960s, powerful trawlers equipped with radar, electronic navigation systems and sonar allowed crews to pursue fish with unparalleled success, and Canadian catches peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
These new technologies adversely affected the Northern Cod population in two important ways: by increasing the area and depth that was fished, the cod were being depleted until the surviving fish could not replenish the stock lost each year; and secondly, the trawlers caught enormous amounts of non-commercial fish, which were economically unimportant but very important ecologically: incidental catch undermines the whole ecosystem, depleting stocks of important predator and prey species. With the Northern Cod, significant amounts of capelin – an important prey species for the cod – were caught as bycatch, further undermining the survival of the remaining cod stock.
Ecological uncertainty.
Another factor important to consider in understanding the fishery's collapse is uncertainty in assessing the cod as a resource. Management of a resource is an extremely complex task, with a multitude of interests, perspectives, and sources of information to take into account; when knowledge regarding the resource is limited, or clouded by imprecision, the task of managing it becomes even more difficult. The management of fisheries is associated with an especially high degree of uncertainty due to problems inherent in the nature of the resource. Newfoundland's cod fisheries were no exception: an imperfect understanding of the ocean ecosystem; technical and environmental challenges associated with observation techniques, which led to incomplete data on the resource (the cod); and the naturally high levels of variability in the population due to dynamic environmental factors (such as ocean temperature) combined to make it arduous to discern the effects of exploitation. Unfortunately, this led to predictions about the cod stock that were mired in uncertainty, making it more difficult for the government to choose the appropriate course of action.
Socioeconomic.
In addition to ecological considerations, decisions regarding the future of the fisheries were also influenced by social and economic factors. Throughout Atlantic Canada, however most pronounced in Newfoundland, the cod fishery was a source of social and cultural identity. For many families, it also represented their livelihood: most families were connected either directly or indirectly with the fishery as fishers, fish plant workers, fish sellers, fish transporters, or as employees in related businesses. Additionally, many companies, both foreign and domestic, as well as individuals, had invested heavily in the boats, equipment and the infrastructure of the fishery, and therefore felt it was in their best interest to maintain an open-access policy to the ocean and its resources. What this alludes to is the unfortunate paradox that often accompanies open-access resources and is known by most as the Tragedy of the Commons: what is in the individual's best interest is not always in the best interest of a society at whole. In the case of Newfoundland and the Northern Cod fishery this meant that from the perspective of the individual participating in the fishing industry, maximizing their catch was in their best interest; however when the government failed to intervene – due largely to the highly sensitive nature of the political discourse created by the expansive group of stakeholders – the ecosystem was brought past its threshold and collapsed, leaving everyone worse-off.
When the government finally acted, it was too late. The 1992 moratorium was at first meant to last two years, hoping that the Northern Cod population would recover, and along with it the fishery. The damage done to Newfoundland's coastal ecosystem proved irreversible. Even after twenty years, the Northern Cod population has not rebounded and the cod fishery remains closed.
Impact of the collapse on Newfoundland.
The collapse of the Northern Cod fishery marked a profound change in the ecological, economic and socio-cultural structure of Atlantic Canada. The moratorium in 1992 marked the largest industrial closure in Canadian history, and it was expressed most acutely in Newfoundland, whose continental shelf lay under the region most heavily fished. Over 35,000 fishers and plant workers from over 400 coastal communities became unemployed. In response to dire warnings of social and economic consequences, the federal government intervened, initially providing income assistance through the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program, and later through the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy, which included money specifically for the retraining of those workers displaced by the closing of the fishery. Newfoundland has since experienced a dramatic environmental, industrial, economic, and social restructuring, including considerable outmigration, but also increased economic diversification, an increased emphasis on education, and the emergence of a thriving invertebrates fishing industry (as the predatory groundfish population declined, snow crab and northern shrimp proliferated, providing the basis for a new industry that is roughly equivalent in economic value as the cod fishery it replaced).
Inspired by the Grand Banks cod fishery collapse, the Marine Stewardship Council was founded in 1997 to set global standards for sustainable fishing.
Present recovery status.
In November 2006, Fisheries and Oceans Canada released an article suggesting that the unexpectedly slow recovery of the cod stock is due to inadequate food supplies, cooling of the North Atlantic, and a poor genetic stock due to the overfishing of larger cod. During the summer of 2011, a study was announced to show that recovery of East Coast cod stocks around Nova Scotia showed promises of recovery, despite earlier thoughts of complete collapse. It was found that initial stages of recovery began around 2005, though more time and studies were needed to study the long-term stability of the stock increase. In addition in 2010 a study by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization found that stocks in Grand Banks near Newfoundland & Labrador had recovered by 69% since 2007, though that number only equates to 10% of the original stock.
In a letter to "Nature" in 2011, a team of Canadian scientists reported that cod in the Scotian Shelf ecosystem off Canada are showing signs of recovery. Brian Petrie, a member of the team, said "Cod is about a third of the way to full recovery, and haddock is already back to historical biomass levels".
Despite such positive reports, cod landings have continued to decline since 2009 according to Fisheries and Oceans Canada statistics through 2012. This decline appears to be continuing through 2013.

Decree-Law 15/93

The Decree-Law 15/93 of January 22 () is a Portuguese drug control law implementing the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.
It classifies substances into six categories, Table () I through Table VI. Tables I and II are each further broken down into classes: A, B, and C. 
This law was also the first that created the crime of money laundering in Portuguese law.
The introduction of the law, which is primarily aimed at controlling drug trafficking, says that although the use of drugs is socially censurable, that "does not prevent drug addicts from being seen in the first place as persons who are in need of medical assistance" who should receive care. Thus, "drug consumers are presently legally punishable in an almost symbolic fashion" that encourages treatment.
While drug use is illegal in Portugal, the law's introduction notes of occasional drug users: "it is necessary above all to avoid them being labelled, marginalised, pushed into an impasse or towards avenues whose only way out is drugs." However, the Portuguese government condemned the Dutch pragmatic policy, well known for its absence of user punishment.
Drug trafficking is punished with very harsh sentences; in the most severe cases, it can be punished by 10 years to 25 years of imprisonment.
Table III.
Table III includes special preparations which may include limited amounts of any of the controlled drugs listed under Tables I and II.
Table V and VI.
Tables V and VI comprise precursor substances (and salts thereof) which may be used to manufacture drugs listed under Tables I and II.

Christ Crucified (Velázquez)

Christ Crucified is a painting of 1632 by Diego Velázquez depicting the Crucifixion of Jesus. The work, painted in oil on canvas, measures 249 x 170 cm and is owned by the Museo del Prado.
During his stay in Rome, Velazquez made various nude studies he used in later paintings, such as "Apollo at the Forge of Vulcan" (1630) and "Joseph's Tunic" (1630). Art critics assert that the nude study for this painting is exceptional and masterly in its fusion of serenity, dignity and nobility. It is a frontal nude on the scale of life, without the support of narrative scene.
Description.
Velazquez followed the accepted iconography in the 17th century. His master, Francisco Pacheco, a big supporter of classicist painting, painted the crucified Christ using the same iconography later adopted by Velazquez: four nails, feet together and supported against a little wooden brace, in a classic contrapposto posture. Both arms draw a subtle curve, instead of forming a triangle. The purity cloth is painted rather small, thus showing the nude body as much as possible. The head shows a narrow halo, as if it came from the figure itself; the face is posed on the chest, showing just enough of his characteristics. The long, straight hair, covers a great part of the face, perhaps anticipating the death, already inflicted as shown by the wound on the right side. It lacks the characteristic dramatic qualities of Baroque painting. 
History.
Because of lack of information, the date of the painting is unknown. Nevertheless, historians believe the work was made after his return from Italy, probably between 1631 and 1632. The influence of Classicist painting is shown by the calm posture of the body, the idealized face and the leaning head. On the other hand, the Caravaggism influence can be seen in the strong Chiaroscuro between the background and the body, and in the strong, artificial lightning over the cross.
It was most likely a commission for the San Plácido Convent sacristy. The painting was among the impounded items of Manuel Godoy, but was returned to María Teresa de Borbón, 15th Countess of Chinchón. After her death, the painting was passed on to his brother-in-law, the Duke of San Fernando de Quiroga, who gave it to King Fernando VII. The king then sent the painting to the Museo del Prado.
Legacy.
The spirituality and mystery of this painting has inspired much religious writing, notably the poem "El Cristo de Velázquez" by the Spanish writer and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno.

Mira Rostova

Mira Rostova (April 10, 1909 – January 28, 2009) was a Russian-born American actress turned acting teacher, best known for her own variation of method acting that she used in coaching of Montgomery Clift. Her other acting students included Armand Assante, Alec Baldwin, Peter Gallagher, Jessica Lange, Zohra Lampert, Jerry Orbach and Madonna (who attended approximately half a dozen class sessions, working on scenes from Tennessee Williams' "Summer and Smoke" and Isherwood's "I Am a Camera"). 
She was born on April 10, 1909 with the surname Rosovskaya in Saint Petersburg, Russia. She fled to Switzerland after the Russian Revolution and then Hamburg, Germany, where she began acting. She also acted in Vienna. She moved to France after the rise of the Nazi party, and made it to the United States by way of England. In the U.S., she abbreviated her surname to Rostova.
Rostova had been taken in on a scholarship by Robert Lewis. She was cast as a fake witch doctor in "Mexican Mural", an experimental play directed by Lewis, when she first met Clift, who also appeared in the play. Gradually, Rostova would play an increasing role in his acting career, discussing for hours the roles he should accept and the way he should act in these roles. Patricia Bosworth, Clift's biographer, described how Rostova had been hired on the payroll as Clift's coach while he was starring in films including "A Place in the Sun" and "The Heiress". 
Rostova was a fixture in his dressing room by 1945, when Clift had a lead role in "You Touched Me!", a play by Tennessee Williams and Donald Windham. Clift became frustrated living at home with his mother and Rostova moved him into her apartment, while she moved out and found another place to live. During the filming of Alfred Hitchcock's 1953 film "I Confess", Rostova stood behind a pillar and Clift would look over for her approval. During the filming of the 1949 drama "The Heiress", co-star Olivia de Havilland said that Clift would look in the opposite direction. 
While other notable acting teachers such as Uta Hagen and Lee Strasberg would also act themselves, Rostova made few appearances of her own on stage or film, though she did perform the role of Nina in her own translation of Anton Chekhov's "The Seagull", which she staged Off Broadway with Clift in 1954. Reviewer Brooks Atkinson in "The New York Times" called it an "interesting performance" of "an incomparably beautiful play", saying that "Rostova as Nina is handicapped by a heavy accent. She is further handicapped by a florid style alien to the whole spirit of Chekhov", though he called Clift's performance as Constantin "beautifully expressed without any foolish pathology".
Elia Kazan kicked her off the set of the 1960 film "Wild River" after a single day of filming. In Richard Schickel's 2005 biography of Kazan, he describes how she positioned herself behind the director during filming and would nod or shake her head as Clift was acting, but Kazan was unwilling to have her as a co-director.
Death.
Rostova died at age 99 on January 28, 2009 in a Manhattan nursing home, three months shy of her 100th birthday. There were no known survivors.

Murray Takes It to the Next Level

"Murray Takes It To The Next Level" is the fourth episode of the second season of the HBO comedy series "Flight of the Conchords". This episode first aired in the United States on February 8, 2009.
Plot synopsis.
Murray tries to elevate Bret and Jemaine on his friendship graph, bringing his questioning pal Jim in on the plan. Mel demands an apology from Bret for inappropriate behavior that she dreamed about.
Plot.
At a band meeting, Murray (Rhys Darby) invites Jemaine (Jemaine Clement) and Bret (Bret McKenzie) to take it to the "next level" on his friendship graph -- to go beyond their current status as "work mates" and surpass the status of "colleagues" (such as Greg (Frank Wood)) to become "friends." Murray also alludes to his "best friend" Jim (Jim Gaffigan) many times. After attempting activities together such as watching a movie, making a fort and "having a sleep," Bret and Jemaine rise up the graph to attain the status of friends. Murray deems it time they meet the elusive Jim, and invites the three to a barbecue, where Jim meets (and endlessly questions) Bret and Jemaine.
Telephoning them later to ask if they want to hang out, Jim is affronted when Bret relays Jemaine's statement that Jim is a "dick." A series of further mishaps, such as turning Murray's desk into a table tennis table, sees Bret and Jemaine relegated down the graph, ending up below their original status of "work mates," as "strangers." Murray says he will see them at the next band meeting, although they will "not know each other." He then introduces himself and departs with Jim (whose endless questioning suits Murray fine).
Meanwhile, Mel (Kristen Schaal) finds Bret and Jemaine and thanks Bret for something he did in her dream last night. Later, however, she reproaches Bret for something else (unmentioned, but which disgusts and horrifies Jemaine) that he did in her next dream. Mel demands that Bret apologizes for his dream behavior, but it continues, and at Murray's martial arts club, Bret and Jemaine receive minor injuries from the furious Mel and Jim, respectively.
Songs.
The following songs appear in this episode:
"Dreams".
Sung by Mel (Kristen Schaal), "Dreams" is a wistful imagining of what life might be like if the world were more like Mel's dreams. Not unexpectedly, the accompanying video reveals that her dreams are dominated by images of Bret and Jemaine.
"Friends".
"Friends", is an a capella song sung by Bret, Jemaine, Murray, and Jim (Jim Gaffigan), describes the sorts of things friends do for each other.
Filming location.
The scene where Mel meets Bret and Jemaine on their bicycles and she begins singing "Like In My Dreams" was filmed on the corner of South 6th Street and Berry Street near the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn.
Portions of the song "Friends" were filmed at a bowling alley called The Gutter in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Cultural references.
Murray offers to show them the film "The World's Fastest Indian" (2005), a movie about the life of New Zealand motorcycle builder and racer Burt Munro.

Stagecoach Gold

Stagecoach Gold is a sub-brand used by various Stagecoach bus subsidiaries in the United Kingdom.
History.
The Goldline brand was introduced to try and win more middle class motorists to bus services. It was initially trialled in two areas, Perth and Warwick from November 2007, both on routes which has received kick-start funding from the government to help establish the routes. Perth's route 7 used £300,000 of its own money to demonstrate the idea to politicians.
Goldline routes have a luxury specification. Buses have hand stitched leather seats, metallic paint, special flooring and free WiFi. Drivers wear special uniform and there is a Goldline customer charter.
In February 2009 the service was expanded to Aldershot and in September 2009 to Cheltenham and Gloucester on route 94. At this stage the brand name changed from "Goldline" to "Stagecoach Gold", as well as the introduction of a new livery with brighter swoops added, as opposed to the previous gold and blue only livery. The reason behind the name change was that Translink had the rights to the "Goldline" name, using it on their Ulsterbus coach services, and Stagecoach had to pay Translink a royalty.
In 2010, the Stagecoach Gold brand was extended to services run by Scottish Citylink, where Stagecoach have a 35% shareholding, where the Glasgow to Aberdeen and Glasgow to Inverness services were designated as Citylink Gold.

Conservation communities

What is a conservation community?
A conservation community is a group of individuals and families living in a community who are committed to saving large parcels of land from ecological degradation. This land can be forested land, agricultural land, ranch land, or any other type of land that needs protecting from high-impact development.
Conservation communities are models of sustainable community development, a new approach to development which provides alternatives to conventional forms of development. They are adaptable to the needs of different regions and they use small-scale residential development to fund conservation, eliminating the need to depend on funding from private donors or governments. This land development model is important to the environmental movements towards sustainable development, Green homebuilding, local food security, and responsible management of natural resources.
Some of the tools used to create conservation communities are conservation covenants, ecoforestry covenants, and other forms of covenant registered to the title of the land. Covenants are a legal contract used to protect the integrity of land. Covenants help protect the ecological health of watersheds (which are damaged by increased development), maintain long-term access to natural resources and associated value-added opportunities, protect native plant and animal species, and prevent climate change impacts of intense development practices. Conservation communities are developed under a standard of performance that not only minimizes their ecological footprint on the Earth but also ensures that the development improves (or at the very least does not diminish) the existing ecological system’s performance.
The planning basis for the residential community focuses around maintaining and enhancing the ecological integrity of the land. The community, therefore, sits on the least sensitive part of the land from an ecological point of view, and is often built using low-impact infrastructure such as LEED-targeted housing.
The economy.
Conservation communities can also offer the opportunity for other eco-compatible uses such as sustainable resource extraction, value-added manufacturing opportunities, organic horticulture, live/work enterprises, ecotourism, recreational and ecological educational opportunities.
Conservation communities can create sustainable employment opportunities for those living in the communities as well as the surrounding region. Ecotourism promotes environmental protection and support for the well-being of local community members by bringing visitors into the conservation community for educational and recreational purposes.
Community.
Conservation communities can be designed to strengthen the connections between neighbors and communities. Kim Davis, of the Vancouver Sun newspaper notes that "while hardship, economic or otherwise, is not something most people desire, let alone seek, adversity does have a way of inspiring collaboration, creativity and innovation."

HSBC El Salvador

Banco HSBC Salvadoreño, S.A., established in 1885, is the third largest bank in the country. It has some 65 branches, 1,800 employees and $1.5 billion in assets.
History.
In 1891, the bank, merged with the branch there of London Bank of Central America under the name Banco Salvadoreño (Bancosal). The bank came to an agreement with Banco Internacional de El Salvador, which had a 25-year monopoly on note issuance, so that it too could issue notes. The government of El Salvador nationalized the bank in 1980 as part of a blanket nationalization of financial institutions, but privatized the bank in 1993.
In November 2006, HSBC acquired Grupo Banistmo (Banistmo), a Panamanian banking group that owned Panama's leading bank, Primer Banco del Istmo, and 106 other branches in Costa Rica, Honduras, Colombia and Nicaragua, as well as 56.2% of the holding company that owned Bancosal. The next year, HSBC extended two tender offers to acquire the remaining shares in the bank. The bank changed its name to Banco HSBC Salvadoreño and then to HSBC El Salvador.
HSBC sold its operations in El Salvador to Davivienda in 2012.

Sablatnig P.III

__NOTOC__
The Sablatnig P.III was an airliner produced in Germany in the early 1920s. 
Development.
A contemporary account identifies the P.III as Germany's first aircraft purpose-designed as a commercial passenger plane. It was a high-wing, strut-braced monoplane of conventional design powered by a single engine in the nose (either a 200-hp Benz, or a 260-hp Maybach). Later the British 258-hp Armstrong Siddeley Puma engine was the usual power plant. The crew of two, a pilot and a navigator or mechanic, were accommodated in separate open cockpits in tandem. These were behind the enclosed six seat passenger cabin in the center of the fuselage. Passengers entered the cabin through a door directly from the ground, rather than having to climb over the side of the aircraft, or up a ladder. The P.III's cabin offered passengers the comfort of an expensive automobile. The structure was of wood throughout, with the fuselage skinned in plywood. The wings and horizontal stabiliser folded for storage or rail transport, and indeed, P.IIIs carried their own tent as a portable hangar.
Operational history.
This aircraft was one of the few approved as a civilian, not military type by the ILÜK ("Interallierte Luftfahrt-Überwachungs-Kommission", Inter-allied Aviation Control Commission) for production in Germany after World War I. However under the Treaty of Versailles all aircraft production was forbidden in Germany for a period of six months during the year 1920, and all existing aircraft, both military and civilian, and including aircraft built after the end of World War I, had to be either handed over to the Allied military or destroyed. As a result Sablatnig ceased building aircraft. Apparently the existing P.IIIs were either hidden or smuggled out of Germany.
17 Sablatnig P.IIIs were registered in Germany in and after 1921. Fritz Sablatnig, the owner of the Sablatnig company, estimated total production at 30 to 40 examples, including 12 made in Estonia by Dwigatel. 
The P.III entered service with a number of airlines in Germany and other countries, including Lloyd Luftverkehr Sablatnig, Deutsche Luft Hansa, Danish Air Express, Aeronaut, as well as with the Swiss Air Force.

Malle Babbe

Malle Babbe is a painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals, painted between 1633 and 1635 and now in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. The painting has also been titled as "Hille Bobbe" or the "Witch of Haarlem". The painting is now often identified with a specific individual from Haarlem, named Malle Babbe, who may have suffered from mental illness. However, it has also been considered a tronie, or genre painting in a portrait format, not intended to be a portrait of a specific individual, even if a model had been used. The painting has been an object of artistic admiration from at least 1869, when Gustave Courbet made a copy while it was on view in Munich.

The painting measures 75 × 64 cm and shows the face of a smiling woman, sitting at the corner of a table, apparently talking or laughing at someone or something to the right of the canvas. With her right hand, the woman is gripping a pewter beer mug with an opened lid. An owl sits on the woman’s left shoulder. The clothing of the woman is simple and corresponds with the mode around 1630 in Haarlem. Her face is animated in an almost manic grimace. The very free handling of paint is typical of Hals' style, and not very different from that on his more formal commissioned portraits.
Name.
The painting was for a long time mislabeled as "Hille Bobbe" ("The Witch of Haarlem") though the inscription on the back of the picture frame reads "Malle Babbe van Haerlem … Frns Hals" (Malle Babbe of Haarlem).
Under the witch interpretation, the owl was considered a possible familiar. However the subject matter of Frans Hals in his other paintings would suggest that the painting is probably of a pub scene, in which case the owl would reflect the Dutch proverb, "drunk as an owl." 
The Real Malle Babbe.
Research in the Netherlands municipality of Haarlem showed that a real Malle Babbe actually existed. She was included in a list of residents of the local hospital called Het Dolhuys, situated outside the city walls, which served people who were dangerous to themselves or to society, as well as a hospice for travellers arriving after the city gates had closed. Around 1642, Pieter Hals, a son of Frans Hals, was also in this hospice. Hals and this Malle Babbe had probably already met by this time, as she was a known personality in Haarlem, although none other of her biographical details survive. In Dutch the adjective "Malle" signifies "loony" and that it is not uncommon to see painters or writers depict this type of village figure. In this type of depiction one can find a record of unbalanced figures of society as belonging to the scenery of every day life, or the artist may enjoy exploring the thin line between sanity and lunacy.
Other paintings.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City is in possession of a similar painting. It is not clear who the creator of this painting is. In the past it was also attributed to Frans Hals, but it is now thought to be the work of one of his pupils.
Song.
In the Netherlands, Malle Babbe is also the subject of a well-known eponymous song, written by Boudewijn de Groot and Lennaert Nijgh and performed in 1973 by Rob de Nijs.

Outwell

Outwell is a village and a civil parish in the English county of Norfolk The village is west of Norwich, south-west of King's Lynn and north of London. The nearest town is Wisbech which is north west of the village. The Village is on the route of the A1101 Bury St. Edmunds to Long Sutton road. The nearest railway station is at Downham Market for the Fen Line which runs between King's Lynn and Cambridge. The nearest airport is Norwich International Airport. The parish of Outwell in the 2001 census, has a population of 1,880. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk.
Description.
The village and parish of Outwell is located on the western edge of the county of Norfolk which borders Cambridgeshire. Up until 1990 Outwell parish was split with half in Norfolk and half in Cambridgeshire with the boundary falling along the old course of the River Nene. The boundary also cut straight through the middle of the village. In 1935 the part of Outwell which was in Cambridgeshire was reduced in size to enlarge the nearby village of Emneth. Outwell parish today is part of the King's Lynn and West Norfolk local government district.
Drains.
The village and parish is traversed with many drainage channels which characterize this part of Fenland Norfolk. The eastern corner of the parish is cut north to south by the Middle Level main Drain.Crossing the parish from east to west is the drain called Well Creek. The north and eastern parts of the parish consist of arable and pasture fields, the eastern area referred to as Walsingham Fens and the north area as Well Moors. On the edges of the village there is a small amount of woodland near Birdbeck Field and to the south and at Church Field to the east of the village.
Name.
It is thought that the name "Outwell" is derived from "old English" and derives from the fact that it is a later settlement or extension of nearby village of Upwell, and suggests that the village of Outwell was established during the Saxon period.
History.
"Outwell" has an entry in the Domesday Book of 1085. In the great book Outwell is recorded by the name of "Utwella" and "Wtwella". The parish was in the custody William de Warenne. The survey also records 16 bordars with lands worth 5s. as belonging to Saint Benedict's abbey in Ramsey.
Drainage and Flooding.
In the Middle Ages the River Nene determined the entail layout of "Outwell". Since that time, the Landscape of the whole district has consequently been much altered by the construction of several large drains which run through the parish. In the 17th century "Popham's Eau" was cut to provide a conduit for the waters of the old "River Nene" into the River Great Ouse at "Salter's Lode". This was followed by many alterations and new drains being dug. In May 1862 one sixth of the Parish of "Outwell" was inundated with water when the Middle Level Drain burst through its banks. It took three years before the area had fully recovered from the flood. Also constructed across the parish was the Wisbech Canal, now disused, which followed the course of the "Well Stream" as far as Outwell church and then struck across in a southeasterly direction to join "Popham's Eau" at "Nordelph".
One consequence of all the drains and watercourse around this part of the Fens is the sport of Fen skating. During the cold winters of the 1820s and 1830s there were a number of fenmen who made a name for themselves as skaters. They included James May of Upwell
Beaupré Hall.
Beaupré Hall was a large 16th century manor house on the outskirts of Outwell, built by the Beaupre family, who also financed the many catholic chapels on the church at Outwell. It was later lived in by Robert Bell during the reign of Elizabeth I. In decline since the Victorian era, during World War II, the hall was commandeered by the RAF and later used for holiday housing. From this point the Hall fell into a state of further disrepair until its demolition in 1966.

Cambridge Highlands

Cambridge Highlands also known as "Area 12", is a neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts bounded by the railroad tracks on the north and east, the Belmont town line on the west, and Fresh Pond on the south. In 2005 it had a population of 673 residents living in 281 households, and the average household income was $56,500.
The street grid is internally disconnected, and the railroads and pond block access north, east, and south. The only through roads are the east-west Concord Avenue and north-south Alewife Brook Parkway. Public transit access includes Alewife Station across the railroad tracks, and buses on Concord Avenue connecting to Harvard Square.
The area is largely industrial-commercial, with the Fresh Pond Mall, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Dunkin' Donuts, Trader Joe's, CVS Pharmacy, and other stores on Alewife Brook Parkway. The mall includes Whole Foods Market, PetSmart, TJMaxx, McDonald's, Staples, and a movie theatre. Also in the neighborhood are BBN Technologies, E Ink Corporation, an office of the Social Security Administration, a Best Western hotel, the Olympia Fencing Center,[http://www.olympiafencingcenter.com] and a large NSTAR electrical substation. A Joyce Chen restaurant, now closed, was previously in the neighborhood.
Near the Belmont line, a few streets in the neighborhood are mainly residential. There are also a few isolated houses on Concord Avenue and a senior living center overlooking Fresh Pond; condominiums have gone up on Wheeler Street. In 2011, a developer purchased 70 Fawcett Street (owned by Level 3 Communications until 2003) and is in the process of constructing a 428-unit residential complex.
Blair Pond, on the western edge of Cambridge Highlands, is part of Alewife Brook Reservation, which continues north of the Fitchburg Line.
History.
Originally, the area was merely swampland between Spy Pond and Fresh Pond, drained by Alewife Brook. What is now Concord Avenue was laid out sometime between 1805 and 1812 as the eastern part of the Cambridge and Concord Turnpike, proceeding directly from the new West Boston Bridge to the center of Concord, Massachusetts.
The Fitchburg Railroad opened in 1843, with stations on both sides of the wetlands (Blanchard Road and Brickworks). A spur to serve freight customers was constructed before the rest of the local street grid, explaining some of the unusual present-day property lines. It ran diagonally from northeast (near the bend in Fawcett Street) to southwest (terminating near customers on Concord Ave at Smith Place). As of 2013, abandoned sidings can still be found south of the Fitchburg main line, which presently carries MBTA Commuter Rail service as the Fitchburg Line (though with no stops in Cambridge Highlands). The Watertown Branch Railroad began construction in 1847, diverging from the Fitchburg main line east of present-day New Street. It skirts Fresh Pond to the east, and provided passenger service to Waltham until 1938. Freight service continued until 2007 or 2009; the railroad was officially abandoned in 2011 and is being turned into a rail trail in segments. The curve of the Watertown Branch defines the rear boundary of the Fresh Pond Mall and the curve of the industrial buildings on New Street.
By 1903, there were still sparse development improvements other than the railroads, Concord Avenue, and a few nearby industrial buildings. The neighborhood was urbanized into a largely industrial area in the 1900s.

Fairway Market

Fairway Market is an American grocery chain. Founded in the 1930s, it is one of the United States' highest grossing food retailers per square foot with 14 million customers per year. Fairway has had significant store expansion in the New York area, with 14 locations in the tri-state area including 14 food markets and 3 wine and spirit shops.
The flagship store still occupies the original Broadway location at West 74th Street, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, with larger locations in Harlem; the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn; Paramus, New Jersey; Plainview, Long Island; Pelham Manor, New York; Stamford, Connecticut; and Woodland Park, New Jersey. In 2011, Fairway expanded even further with two more locations: one on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, which opened July 20th, and the other in Douglaston, Queens, which opened on November 16th. In 2012, Fairway Market opened three more locations: in Woodland Park, New Jersey on June 6; Westbury, Long Island on August 22; and Kips Bay in midtown Manhattan in late December. In 2013, Fairway Market opened a location in Chelsea, Manhattan and another in Nanuet, New York. The company currently employs about 5,000 people.
Sterling Investment Partners, a private equity firm in Westport, Connecticut, bought a controlling stake in Fairway Market in January 2007 and committed to substantially expanding the chain in the Greater New York metropolitan area. Sterling made a $150 million capital investment in Fairway and has thus far committed to over $100 million for Fairway’s expansion, enabling the enterprise to grow rapidly and generating 2,100 new jobs in the tri-state area within the ensuing 3 1/2 years. 
In 2011, the chain had revenues of $550 million. It was spun off in an IPO on April 17, 2013, trading under its parent Fairway Group Holdings on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol FWM.
Stores.
The original Fairway Market, at West 74th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side, was a modest produce shop. By 1997, it had expanded. A café serves sandwiches, burgers, and breakfast, and becomes a steakhouse by night. In September of 2012, a shopper's video of mice and/or rats walking on open bins of olives and in at least one other part of the store went viral.
In 1995, Fairway's Harlem store opened in a significantly larger space. This store has a 10,000-square-foot (930 m) enclosed space, the "Cold Room", which contains the store's meats, seafood, dairy products, and beer. Silver coats hang nearby for customers who wish to keep warm while browsing the freezer.
In 2001, the company opened its first store outside the city, in the Long Island community of Plainview. In 2006, it opened its fourth store, in Red Hook, Brooklyn.
Fairway's fifth store opened on March 25, 2009, in the Fashion Center shopping mall in suburban Paramus, New Jersey, its first store west of the Hudson River.
Growth and expansion.
On April 14, 2010, Fairway opened a new branch in the Westchester County village of Pelham Manor, directly across The Bronx border. This became Fairway's third location in the New York City suburbs and sixth overall. The company signed a lease on a site formerly occupied by Kmart.
Fairway’s seventh location opened in November 2010 in Stamford, Connecticut and employs over 500 people. The Stamford store is the largest one to date at over 80,000 square feet.
With the Pelham Manor opening, Fairway expanded its offering to its customers with their first Wine and Spirit superstore adjacent to the market. Their second wine and spirit superstore is adjacent to the Stamford market; it is . the newest is beside Fairway Market, Woodland Park; it includes a temperature controlled room for high-end wines, a tasting bar, and a staff of specialists and sommeliers.
In 2011, Fairway opened two new locations, one on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on 86th Street, between 2nd and 3rd Avenues, and one in Douglaston, Queens, generating more than 1,000 additional new jobs in the tri-state region.
In June 2012, Fairway opened its tenth food store and third Wine and Spirits Store in Woodland Park, New Jersey. Fairway Market opened a 68,000-square-foot store in the Roosevelt Raceway Center in Westbury in August, 2012. The store brought about 500 new jobs to the community. In December 2012, Fairway opened the Kips Bay location on East 30th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan. 
Fairway Market opened their 13th store in Chelsea, in Manhattan, on July 24th, 2013.
Fairway opened their 14th store in Nanuet, New York, at the The Shops at Nanuet mall on October 10th, 2013.
Fairway Market will open a 53,000 square foot store in the DSW Plaza at 4000 Middle Country Road in Lake Grove Long Island, New York in Spring 2014. This store will be the first Fairway Market location in Suffolk County on Long Island and the 15th food store in the tri-state New York, New Jersey and Connecticut region. 
In Fall 2014, Fairway will open a 52,242 square foot grocery in Manhattan’s TriBeCa neighborhood, on two stories at 255 Greenwich St. (at Murray St). It will be the first Fairway location in Lower Manhattan and the 16th Fairway food store.
Fairway Market will be the anchor food tenant in Hudson Yards, the new real estate development on Manhattan's West Side. It is scheduled to open in 2015. The Hudson Yards location would be the eighth Fairway supermarket in the city. The brand new 45,000 square foot supermarket will take up the ground floor retail space in the project's South Tower at 30th Street and Tenth Avenue.
Cheesemonger.
In 1976, Fairway Market’s Master Cheesemonger and Master Buyer, Steve Jenkins, was the first American cheesemonger inducted into France’s centuries-old Guilde des Fromager, Confrerie de Saint-Uguzon, which is The French master cheesemongers’ guild in Dijon, and today he is a prud’homme, the guild’s highest status. In 1982, he became the first American to be inducted into France’s master cheesemonger guild, the Taste-Fromage. In 1995, Jenkins was also dubbed “The city’s premier authority on cheese” by "New York" magazine in its “The 100 Smartest New Yorkers” special issue. Then in 1996, he published the book "Cheese Primer", which has since been honored with a prestigious James Beard Award. In 2004, Jenkins was named one of the most important people who shaped the specialty food industry by "The Gourmet Retailer". In 2008, Jenkins also received the American Cheese Society’s Lifetime Achievement Award. In that same year, he published his second book, "The Food Life: Inside the World of Food with the Grocer Extraordinaire at Fairway". In addition, he’s a contributing writer for Fairway Market’s blog "On Our Plate" and for the "Olive Oil Times". 
Jenkins is often interviewed by the media, and he and Fairway Market were featured during a History Channel "Modern Marvels" documentary on cheese. Other media appearances have included PBS with Jacques Pepin, CBS’s "Sunday Morning", the "Rachael Ray Show", and "The Splendid Table" on NPR with Lynne Rossetto Kasper.
Community involvement.
Fairway Market becomes active in and supports the communities in the areas where it opens its stores. Its stores regularly donate thousands of pounds of food annually. Every year, Fairway Market partners with local food banks, such as Food Bank For New York City, for their Check-Out Hunger fundraising initiatives. 
Fairway also has a history of giving during the holidays. In 2010, it donated more than 20,000 nutritious holiday meals to the Food Bank for Westchester. And for Thanksgiving 2011, Fairway Market donated more than 2,500 turkeys. 
Additionally, Fairway Market has had a longstanding commitment to firefighters, and in the months following 9/11, adopted local firehouses, supplying them with food throughout the rescue and recovery and clean-up efforts. Fairway also hosts annual Firefighter Food Face-Off events where firefighters can compete against one another in a grilling competition where the winning team wins a gift card to shop at Fairway for their firehouse. Fairway also hosts a Shopping Night in honor of the winning firefighters where a percentage of proceeds are donated to a charity of their choice. 
Fairway Market hosts Shopping Nights like these for other organizations, too, such as the one it hosted in October 2011 for St. Luke’s LifeWorks, in Connecticut, during which 25 percent of all sales were donated to this social service non-profit agency that aids the homeless in Lower Fairfield County. 
Fairway Market rushed to help during Superstorm Sandy, keeping its stores open and delivering food and cleaning supplies to people in need. Fairway Market donated $30,000 to ReStore Red Hook, a non-profit group dedicated to the recovery of small businesses forced to close after Sandy ravaged the neighborhood in October. 
Fairway Market was the Hospitality Partner at Macy's 37(th) Annual Fourth of July Fireworks Show on July 4, 2013. Thousands of guests invited by Macy's enjoyed dinner, drinks and dessert provided by Fairway, and watched the fireworks display from a prime location on the Westside of Manhattan. 
Thanksgiving.
Every year during Thanksgiving, Fairway has made it a tradition to give a happy holiday to those less fortunate. In all of its locations, Fairway donates food to shelters and food banks so that people who can’t afford a good Thanksgiving dinner can get one for free. Along with turkeys, Fairways typically gives the usual holiday fixings, including stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, etc. Last year, just from its Uptown store, Fairway donated over 650 turkeys throughout the city.
Environmental Commitment.
Along with Fairway’s Red Hook store's being awarded the U.S. government’s ENERGY STAR CHP Award for its conservation efforts, Fairway Market’s stores are using Energy Star qualified fixtures and equipment. The lighting in the stores is energy efficient, and the heat generated by Fairway’s refrigeration and freezer units is reclaimed to heat the stores’ aisles and hot water. Fairway also uses waste-to-water technology as part of its waste decomposition system to eliminate the hauling of solids to landfills. And most of the products shipped to Fairway use 100% recyclable corrugated materials and nearly all are stacked on 100% recycled pallets. Plus, cleaning and maintenance supplies that are DfE certified, which is the EPA’s Design for the Environment program, are used in part at the stores and its facilities, and they’re purchased in concentrated form to not use and waste excess packaging. Lastly, Fairway’s Stamford store is in a LEED-certified (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) building.

Doña Antonia de Ipeñarrieta y Galdós and Her Son Don Luis

Doña Antonia de Ipeñarrieta y Galdós and Her Son Don Luis is a 1634 portrait by Diego Velázquez, now in the Prado Museum. 
Doña Antonia and her son Luis are shown standing, captured in an elegant melancholy. The woman uses the chair to support herself, to emphasize her social status in the Court, where she had the right to sit. According to different studies of the canvas, it is believed that the child's figure could have been added afterwards.
In this portrait, Velázquez begins to reinterpret long strokes influenced by Juan Pantoja de la Cruz, giving more expression and delicacy, expressing her natural and easy manner, and capturing a golden light with inexplicable technique. In any case, the experts consider the portrait of her husband to be superior.
History.
The portrait belonged to the family depicted in the painting until the year 1905, in which, its proprietor at the time, Doña María del Pilar Azlor de Aragón y Guillamas, XV Duchess of Villahermosa, the seventh grandchild of the woman in the portrait, bequeathed the painting and its partner, which belonged to the second husband of Doña Antonia, Don Diego del Corral y Arellano, by the same artist, painted years before, to the Prado Museum of Madrid.
In 1989 the painting was a part of an exposition on Velázquez which occurred in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
Persons shown.
Antonia de Ipeñarrieta.
Of noble ancestry, Doña Antonia de Ipeñarrieta was the daughter of Cristóbal and Antonia, born in Villareal de Urrechu, in the Guipúzcoa (País Vasco) province, where her family owned a large palace located on the side of the Irimo mountain. She was the lady-in-waiting of the Queen Isabella II of Spain, and servant of the house of Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias; she died in Madrid in 1634.
She was first married to Don García Pérez de Araciel, knight of the Order of Santiago, professor of law in the University of Salamanca and attorney general of the Council of Castile, who died in 1624. Once she became a widow, she got married again in Madrid in 1627 to Don Diego del Corral y Arellano, professor of law in the University of Salamanca, attorney of the Real Audiencia y Chancillería de Valladolid (1608), attorney and advisor of the Consejo de Hacienda (1612 y 1622), attorney and advisor of the Supremo de Justicia (1616 y 1618), knight of the Order of Santiago (1622), and of the Council of Castile (1629).
Luis del Corral y Arellano.
The third child of Doña Antonia and her second husband, Don Diego, Luis was born in Madrid and was baptized under the name of Luis Vicente. He did not follow the family tradition of law and service of the Monarchy of Spain, and lived away from the court, residing in the cities of Madrid and Baeza, married to a cousin of his father, whom he did not succeed.

Sarah Britten

Sarah Jane Britten (born 31 August 1974) is a South African writer, blogger, lipstick artist and communication strategist.
Early life and career.
Britten attended Bryanston Primary School and Redhill High School in Johannesburg and studied Drama at Wits University, where she completed a BA(Hons) in Dramatic Art in 1996, a MA in Communication Studies in 1997 and a PhD in Applied English Language Studies in 2005. At university she explored her interests in national identity and humour with a Masters Research Report on South African humour, focussing on the Madam & Eve comic strip, and her PhD thesis "One Nation, One Beer: The Mythology of the New South Africa in Advertising".
She worked in journalism and advertising prior to becoming a freelance communication strategist.
Writing.
Britten has authored two youth novels and three non-fiction books on local insults. In 2012 she wrote "... insults are also markers of collective identity. This is why I started collecting South African insults back in 2004: I wanted to understand what makes us who we are, and insults are one prism through which to view the national self ...".
She regularly contributes to "Thought Leader", a news and opinion website run by the "Mail & Guardian" newspaper.
She wrote the chapter "How Not to Emigrate" in "Should I stay or should I go? To live in or leave South Africa", having returned to South Africa after emigrating to Australia in 2008. In the editor's introduction to the book, Tim Richman writes: "Many of the contributions in this book are deeply personal; such is the nature of the topic. For Sarah Britten, there was no other way to approach her traumatic and disastrous emigration experience, one that ultimately destroyed her marriage. Or, as she suggests, perhaps it extended it beyond its sell-by date. Sarah is candid, open, honest, raw – uncomfortably at times. But hers is a necessary and hugely revealing piece, clarifying both the extent of the life-hold that emigration can exert on individuals and families, as well as the stresses it can generate." At the time, she wrote about her emigration experience on her "Thought Leader" blog which she named "Gondwanaland" after the ancient southerly supercontinent that included Africa, Australia and Antarctica among other present-day landmasses.
Lipstick art.
Britten paints cityscapes and other subjects, namely still life, bulls and bears (stock market trend symbols), dogs, cats, horses, sharks, crocodiles, rhinos, Nguni cattle and dung beetles, with lipstick. Her art is influenced by "Zoo City", a science fiction novel by South African author Lauren Beukes. On her art website, she says: "Set in Hillbrow, the zoo city of the title, it features characters mysteriously attached to animal familiars as a form of punishment. Zoo City is riotous, chaotic and completely crazy and I loved the way it brought to life the animal energy that lurks just beneath the surface of the city. After reading the book, I started experimenting with placing animals in cityscapes, both the kind that are found in cities (dogs and cats) and those that exist in Johannesburg only as metaphors – sharks and crocodiles, for example. I’ve used a limited palette of black, grey and red to evoke the dystopian atmosphere of the city, its grey grittiness a contrast to throbbing red life. The Zoo City series led to my experiments with Ngunis, which have taken me in a more colourful direction." The first public exhibition of her lipstick art, named "Pulse of the City" and inspired by a Land Rover marketing campaign, was held at "Velo" gallery café in Braamfontein in July 2012.

John Fraser (footballer born 1936)

John Fraser is a retired Scottish association football player, who played primarily as an outside right for Hibernian in the late 1950s and early 1960s. After a brief spell with Stenhousemuir, Fraser returned to Hibs as a coach, a position he held for 10 years under three different managers.
Fraser signed for Hibs in 1954, but was initially a part-time player while he completed his national service. He had the unenviable task of covering for and eventually replacing Gordon Smith, who Fraser idolised. Fraser played in the 1958 Scottish Cup Final and some of Hibs' famous European nights in the early 1960s, including a friendly match win against Real Madrid and a Fairs Cup win against Barcelona.
After spending a few years as a player-coach in Hibs' reserve team, Fraser briefly played for Stenhousemuir, before returning to Hibs as a coach. Bob Shankly brought him back initially, and Willie MacFarlane then offered Fraser a full-time coaching position. Fraser continued in this position under Eddie Turnbull, as Hibs enjoyed one of the most successful periods in their history in the early 1970s.

Sylvenstein Dam

Sylvenstein Dam is an earthen embankment dam in the Isar valley, in the alpine part of Upper Bavaria, Germany which impounds the Sylvenstein Reservoir ().
Several hydropower plants were built in the tributary of the upper Isar river in the 1920s, for example at the Achensee and Lake Walchen Power Plant. Therefore, the river ran nearly dry during the dry season. This mainly affected the town of Bad Tölz. A reservoir was established to ensure a minimum level of water in the river. During the dry season a volumetric flow of 4 cubic metres per second is released to prevent the Isar from running dry. Additionally, the reservoir provides flood control for the Isar river between Bad Tölz and Munich.
The dam is 44 metres high and has a length of 180 metres. It was built between 1954 and 1959. From 1959 on, the water was also used to drive a hydropower plant of 3.2 MW. The plant was upgraded in 2000 with new turbines to generate 3.8 MW.
During the 2005 European floods, because the maximum capacity of the reservoir was reached, more water than normal had to be released into the Isar river, but the flooding would have been more severe if the Sylvenstein Dam had not been present.

The Jester Barbarroja

The Jester Barbarroja ("El bufón Barbarroja") is an oil on canvas portrait by Diego Velázquez of Cristóbal de Castañeda y Pernia, nicknamed Barbarroja in his role as a jester at the court of Philip IV of Spain from 1633 to 1649. The painting is now in the Museo del Prado; it was in the Palacio del Buen Retiro in Madrid in 1701 and from 1816 to 1827 it was in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando.
The composition's subject also served Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, for whom he played Barbarroja (the Turkish pirate defeated by Don John of Austria at the Battle of Lepanto) in comic plays. He was later banished from the court, to Seville, by the Duke of Olivares for a reply he gave the king when asked whether there were olives in the Segovian town of Balsain - to this, the jester punningly replied "Sir, neither olives nor Olivares".

Blackburn Pellet

The Blackburn Pellet was a single-engined, single-seater biplane flying boat designed as a contender for the 1923 Schneider Trophy competition. It was destroyed whilst taking off for the trials of the contest. 
Development.
The 1923 Schneider Trophy competition was held in Great Britain and Blackburn decided to submit a contestant. A flying boat (the Supermarine Sea Lion III) had won the contest the year before, and in addition, Blackburn had the elegant hull of the unfinished N.1B fleet escort bomber in store since 1918. A small flying boat therefore seemed the right approach. Only the hull and possibly the wingtip floats of the N.1B were used in the Pellet; the rest of the aircraft was new.
The hull was a two-step design using the Linton Hope construction method. This used a system of circular formers separated by stringers and covered with a double layer of 0.125 in (3.2 mm) mahogany strips, the second at right angles to the first. This allowed the construction of smooth curved surfaces. The Pellet was a single-bay biplane without stagger and was often described as a sesquiplane because the lower wing was not only of smaller span but also of smaller chord. The lower wing was mounted on the top of the fuselage and carried wingtip floats mounted directly below the N-type interplane struts. There was another pair of these struts between fuselage and upper wing supporting the engine, which was mounted tractor-wise above the upper wing surface in a neat, streamlined nacelle. The engine, a 450 hp (340 kW) Napier Lion was cooled with radiators fitted flush in the lower surface of the upper wing. The pilot sat in front of the airscrew. At the rear of the aircraft, the braced tailplane was mounted about halfway up the single fin. 
Operational history.
The intention was to have the Pellet flying a month before the race, but the aircraft sank at its first launch on 23 July 1923. It next flew on 26 September 1923, a day before the race. Inevitably, this flight revealed some problems, chiefly of trim and cooling, and that night, a new radiator and propeller were fitted. It set off in the morning to the trials, but on the take-off run, baulked by a small boat, the aircraft began porpoising and was wrecked. Happily, the pilot, R.W.Kenworthy escaped unhurt.

Sursum Corda (group)

The “Sursum Corda” is a poorly investigated Italian student movement. It seems to have its origins in the Italian youth organisations from the first years of the 20th century such as the “battaglioni studenteschi” founded in 1906 (or so) in Milan. The model were the German Burschenschaften.
Organized with irredentist purposes before 1914, they can be considered one of the precursors of fascist organizations in Italy.
Their Fiuman member was Nino Host Venturi, According to Host Venturi, he already in 1913 organised a "Battaglione studenti volontari “Sursum Corda”" in Brescia with students and expats from Austria-Hungary. They trained during weekends in the surrounding hills with the support from Italian regular army officers.
In spring 1919 they had already a battalion-strength formation in Trieste.
Nino Host Venturi kept the contacts with Gabriele D'Annunzio and organised his arrival in Fiume.
Leo Negrelli from Trieste was another affiliate of the “Sursum Corda.”

MK One

MK One was a British fashion retailer.
History.
Beginnings as Mark One.
The company was founded by in the 1980s by Mark Brafman, Les Lucy and Alan Simons as Mark One, and became a discount womenswear retailer. In February 1996 Mark One was bought from administration by billionaire Philip Green, owner of BHS. Shami Ahmed had also made a failed bid for the company in 1996. In the 2000s, a change to the firm's logo saw the firm's name begin to be commonly spelt as "MK One". In 2003 Green sold most of stake in MK One, whilst keeping 10%, to Elaine McPherson, the managing director, and David Thompson, the finance director.
Sale to Baugur.
In November 2004, the 177 store MK One chain was bought by the Icelandic group Baugur for £55 million (this included £11 million worth of debts); in February 2009 Baugur itself entered the equivalent of administration. Les Johnston became chief executive, and Andy Hall became finance director. Johnston and Hall took a 20% stake in the chain, while Baugur, had a 41% shareholding. The banks Landsbanki and Barclays provided debt, taking 36% of Mk One. Arev, a consulting firm, took 3%. McPherson and Thompson left the group. Baugur had planned to expand to chain to around 450 stores. In 2007 the company made losses of £17.4 million.
Sale to Hilco, administration and sale to Brafman.
In May 2008, a majority stake in the 170 store company was sold to Hilco, a restructuring specialist. Three weeks later in May, Hilco appointed Deloitte as administrators, to find a buyer for MK One. The company was sold from administration back to Mark Brafman, its founder, via Jet Star Retail. Bali Singh took over as boss when Brafman left in October, and Singh tried to acquire more funds to allow the business to continue. One of the company's suppliers, which had not been paid, started the bankruptcy proceedings. Around 60 of the stores were closed.
Administration and sale to Internacionale Retail.
Deloitte continued to act for MK One’s original lenders, but was forced to place MK One into administration with Leonard Curtis. On 20 November, the 125 store chain entered administration, putting 1,400 jobs at risk. Leonard Curtis said that there had been a number of expressions of interest for the company.
On 25 November, 80 stores were sold by administrators (Neil Bennett of Leonard Curtis) to Internacionale Retail. 45 stores closed, but around 800 jobs saved. The Indian textiles group S Kumars Nationwide purchased Glasgow-based Internacionale earlier in 2008. The head office in Acton, west London, was closed. By May 2009 all Mk One stores that were purchased by Internacionale had been rebranded under that firm's name.

No. 11 Group RAAF

No. 11 Group was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) group formed at Morotai in the last weeks of World War II to command the RAAF's garrison units in the region. The group was established at the end of July 1945, but was not yet fully active when the war ended on 14 August. It remained active at Morotai until being disbanded at the end of March 1946.
History.
No. 11 Group was established at Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies on 16 July 1945 to free the Australian First Tactical Air Force from garrison duties after most of its combat elements had moved forward from bases in Morotai and near New Guinea to islands off Borneo to support the Borneo Campaign. No. 11 Group's commanding officer was Air Commodore Raymond Brownell, who had previously been Air Officer Commanding, Western Area.
No. 11 Group took over administrative control of all RAAF units on Morotai on 30 July. The group's initial area of responsibility was all Dutch territory north of latitude 7 degrees south and east of longitude 108 degrees east, British North Borneo and Sarawak. The principal RAAF airfields in these areas were at Hollandia, Biak, Middelburg, Morotai, Labuan and Tarakan.
The group had three main responsibilities:
No. 11 Group was to be formed from elements of the RAAF's Northern Command and the First Tactical Air Force. It was planned that the group would initially consist of its headquarters and No. 79, No. 452, No. 457 and No. 120 squadrons, all of which were equipped with fighter aircraft. On 30 July No. 80 Wing's headquarters was absorbed into No. 11 Group, with most of its personnel being transferred into the newly formed group. No. 11 Telecommunications Unit was also formed on 1 August to provide communications services for the group.
The war ended before No. 11 Group was fully formed and assumed its full responsibilities, and its combat operations were limited to small strikes against Japanese positions on Halmahera. No. 79 Squadron attacked Halmahera with its Spitfire fighters on 30 and 31 July. These attacks were followed up by a larger attack on 4 August in which No. 11 Group commanded an attack on Halmahera which involved twelve B-24 Liberator heavy bombers from the United States Thirteenth Air Force and six No. 79 Squadron Spitfires. No. 79 Squadron continued daily operations against Halmahera until the end of the war. No. 11 Group also directed operations conducted by No. 82 Wing on an unofficial basis in the last days of the war.
No. 11 Group celebrated Christmas 1945 with a formal dinner. It was disbanded at Morotai on 31 March 1946.

The Jester Don Diego de Acedo

The Jester Don Diego de Acedo is one of a series of portraits of jesters at the court of Philip IV of Spain by Diego Velázquez. Its subject is the dwarf Don Diego de Acedo, known as "el Primo" (the Cousin). The 1645 oil painting is currently housed at the Prado Museum. The work measures 106 cm high and 83 cm wide.
Velázquez painted a series of portraits of dwarfs and jesters of the court of Philip IV, depicted with realism and respect. The portraits were intended to be displayed in the king's hunting lodge, the Torre de la Parada.
Don Diego de Acedo was a figure of fun whose physical deformity provided entertainment for the court. As with another subject, Don Sebastian de Morra, Velázquez pictured de Acedo's whole body seated on the ground.
Don Diego de Acedo is pictured looking at the observer. Dressed in black, he is reading a book, which is the traditional representation of a gentleman. The size of the tome in his lap emphasizes the dwarf's smallness. The eyes, high forehead and attitude of the model conveys a sense of his intelligence. 
At his feet lay a pile of books with an inkwell and feather. The bottom is possibly unfinished, as a foggy landscape can be seen.

The 1991-92 New York Islanders season was the 20th season in the franchise's history. Denis Potvin's number 5 and Mike Bossy's number 22 were retired by the franchise.
Regular season.
Pat LaFontaine, frustrated with his situation on Long Island, turned down a four year, $6 million contract offer and refused to report to the Islanders for the start of the 1991–92 NHL season. Three weeks into the season, on 25 October 1991, LaFontaine was traded, along with teammate Randy Wood, to the Buffalo Sabres for four players, including former first overall pick Pierre Turgeon.
Also in October, Captain Brent Sutter is traded to the Chicago Blackhawks. Forward Patrick Flatley is named team captain.
Although they finished last in the NHL in penalty-killing percentage (76.50%), the Islanders had a good power-play unit, finishing 3rd in the NHL with 22.12% (75 for 339).

Thomas J. Duffy

Thomas J. Duffy is a designer/craftsman whose present work is the conceptualization and creation of curved doors using lasers. Duffy has also crafted one-of-a-kind cabinets, chairs, and other furniture. For many years, Duffy also made St. Lawrence River rowing skiffs. One of his furniture works is in the permanent collection of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He has exhibited at numerous galleries and other venues. "The New York Times" described him as “One of this country’s leading cabinet and chair makers..." 
Biography.
Since his beginnings in the mid-1970s, Duffy’s work has evolved substantially. His early creations focused on the execution of fine cabinetry using only non-powered hand tools. He now applies laser and computer technology to the meticulous design and construction of radius entry doors. The course of Duffy’s woodworking follows the arc illuminated in “From Hand Ax to Laser” by John Purcell. Purcell’s book outlines the evolution of the use of energy through history. Duffy began in the mid-1970s in Ogdensburg, NY as a self-employed furniture maker. He originally limited himself voluntarily and exclusively to the use of hand tools and intentionally avoided power tools. Focusing on the art of fine furniture and architectural woodworking, and determined to make a living from his art and craft, he came to incorporate power tools into his work. From 2002 to the present he has been combining hand craftsmanship with laser and computer technology at his shop in Cambridge, NY (“Laser-Crafts”). He now focuses primarily on building curved doors.
Shows and Works.
Thomas J. Duffy’s art has appeared in exhibits in New York City, Boston, Canada, and at the Frederic Remington Art Museum in Ogdensburg, NY. “Holly Veneer and Inlay Bench” is in the permanent collection of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts’ exhibit, “American Decorative Arts.” Another work, “Wall Piece,” became part of a Christie’s benefit auction for the New York City Opera in 1990. That same year, Duffy created a featured piece for the Empire State Crafts Alliance fund-raiser. The piece, called “Chair Within a Chair,” was on display at the Heller Gallery in SOHO, New York City. During that weekend, Duffy also exhibited a folding screen at Saks Fifth Avenue. In both the chair and the screen Duffy applied the pentimento technique. He exhibited in “American Concern for Artistry and Craftsmanship,” a temporary show at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City in 1980. He presented “Curly Maple Chair” to the U.S. Ambassador to Canada in May 1981. The chair is now a part of the Embassy’s permanent collection in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In December 1979 a one-man show at the Frederic Remington Art Museum in Ogdensburg, NY, spotlighted 50 pieces by Duffy as well as numerous photographs of his work.
Publications and Appearances.
Duffy appeared on the Public Broadcasting System’s (PBS) program, “American Woodshop,” in February 1997, when he described how he builds curved panels for his radius entry doors. He has lectured at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, CA, the Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle, WA, the Peter’s Valley Crafts School of New Jersey, and the Brookfield Craft Center in Brookfield, CT.
His work has been featured in the Boston Herald Sunday Magazine, Period Homes Magazine, Fine Woodworking Magazine, and in the first three volumes of the Fine Woodworking Design Book. "House Beautiful," "The New York Times," and the "AIA Journal" have also profiled Duffy and his work.
National Recognition.
National recognition of Duffy’s woodworking dates back more than 20 years. Michael Varese wrote the following in The New York Times:
“Thomas Duffy of Ogdensburg, N.Y., one of this country's leading cabinet and chair makers working with figured maple along traditional lines, searches for the wood using the ‘window’ method. Armed with a hatchet and a can of tree-wound paint he moves among the maples, removing 3 or 4 square inches of bark to a depth exposing the inner growths. Mr. Duffy says the telltale sign of bird's-eye maple is a swirling disordered surface, bumpy and sometimes pitted. Curly maple will reveal itself as an end view of a slice through a wave or ripple running parallel to the ground. Distinctive patterns are usually found in maples in densely wooded sites.” 
Radius Doors.
Duffy’s current endeavor is the curved door. “Normal” flat doors continue and complete a flat plane (the wall). But a radius entry door, or any other radius or curved door, usually continues a curved wall. A curved door is best visualized as one section of a large cylinder. 
Radius doors must be built with extreme care in order to precisely match the curve of the walls they will be embedded in - thus the assistance of laser technology. Duffy uses a Kern CO2 laser to cut patterns that he either creates himself or receives from a client. With the 100 watts of energy generated by the laser, he focuses on a point the size of a pinhead, allowing for intricate cuts in sometimes delicate materials, and for a degree of precision not afforded him by the use of regular power tools. Almost all varieties of wood lend themselves to laser-work.
The final product may be a hinged or “swing” door, a pocket door that will slide into a wall when opened, or a door that slides along the face of a wall. 
Duffy has created curved doors for the Prettyman Courthouse in Washington, D.C. and for residences throughout the U.S., with commissions recently in New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles.

Circuito del Montenero

The Montenero Circuit, official name: Circuito del Montenero or sometimes referred to simply as "the Livorno Circuit", was a Grand Prix motor racing road course located at the southern outskirts of Livorno, a city on the mediterranean coast of the Tuscany region in Italy. The venue was best known as the home for the annual Circuito Montenero - Coppa Ciano and the 1937 Italian Grand Prix.
The circuit was created in 1921 at the initiative of Paolo Fabbrini, owner of the newspaper "Corriere di Livorno" to host local sports car races. On September 25 the same year, the first "Coppa Montenero" was held on a 18.5 km long public roads circuit, starting at the seafront "Rotunda" (Parco Bartolini) in the Ardenza district of Livorno, stretching up into the hills of Montenero, climbing to about 300 meters above sea level before returning down to the start/finish line. The circuit was long, with dangerous sections and extremely hard on both man and machine but considered a huge success, attracting interest from regional motoring clubs and the automobile industry alike.
In 1927, Livorno-born politician Costanzo Ciano donated the first "Coppa Ciano" trophy, starting one of the most prestigious Grand Prix racing series to endure for the next 12 years. Like many other circuits of the era, Montenero had to change its layout several times over the years to accommodate the growing demands of racing technology. The last major Circuito Montenero - Coppa Ciano Grand Prix in 1939 also marks the end of the great road course era. Safety concerns, increasingly unmanageable circuit demands among other factors left shorter, purpose-built race tracks as the only viable alternative for future Grand Prix venues. One last "Coppa Montenero" was held in 1947 in an attempt to revive the circuit but proved to be financially unsuccessful. A minor sports car race in 1953 was the last event before the track was closed down for good.
Circuit history.
(*) The mountain section of the circuit was dropped from 1936 to 1947
Notes.
"Inconsistencies and discrepancies in Grand Prix era race numbering were often due to political conflicts between regional municipalities and national sanctioning bodies. (example: Grand Prix de la Marne vs Grand Prix de Reims vs Grand Prix de l'ACF"

The 2nd Race of Champions was a non-Championship motor race, run to Formula One rules, held on 12 March 1967 at Brands Hatch circuit in Kent, UK. The race was run over two heats of 10 laps of the circuit, then a final of 40 laps, and was won overall by Dan Gurney in an Eagle Mk1. 
The grid positions for the first heat were decided by a qualifying session, and the grid for the second heat was determined by the finishing order of the first heat. Similarly, the finishing order for the second heat decided the grid order for the final, although some positions were apparently changed.
Gurney won both heats and the final, taking fastest lap in both heats. The fastest lap of the final was driven by Jack Brabham, although it was slower than Gurney's laps in the heats.

Saor Raidió Chonamara

Saor Raidió Chonamara (Free Radio Connemara) was an Irish language pirate radio station that was formed out of frustration over the lack of Gaelic-language media by the civil rights movement Gluaiseacht Cearta Sibhialta. The station started broadcasting on Easter Sunday 1970 to considerable press coverage, gaining notoriety in the process. It was even featured in the "Irish Independent". Because these transmissions throughout the Gaeltacht were illegal (RTÉ had the monopoly at the time), the station continued in total secrecy with the transmitter and studio being transported by Honda 50 to stay one step ahead of the law.
The station's considerable success was enough to force the Irish Government to establish RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta in response, proving that there was a need for a station.

Alta Telegraph Company

The Alta Telegraph Company was a telegraph company which operated in the mid-19th century within the state of California prior to the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph. It was incorporated in the early 1850s. Its first line was constructed during 1854, stretching from Sacramento to Marysville and extending up into the foothills of the adjacent Sierra Nevada mountains. In subsequent years, a line was constructed between Sacramento and Benicia. From Benicia, a branch line was extended to Vallejo and the US Navy yard at Mare Island.
Telegraph Road.
In April 1859, a cable was run across the Carquinez Strait between Benicia and Martinez, and a connecting line constructed from Martinez to Oakland over the Berkeley Hills (then called the Contra Costa Range). It was this line which gave rise to the name "Telegraph Road" for the thoroughfare which the line followed down the western slope of the hills, which later became Telegraph Avenue in Oakland and Berkeley.
Lawsuit.
From Oakland, the Alta Telegraph Company laid a cable under San Francisco Bay to San Francisco, but the cable failed to work. An alternate route was then used, extending around the southern end of the bay via San Jose. This route, however, was already used by the competing California State Telegraph Company under a special act of the State of California. The California State Telegraph Company successfully sued the Alta Telegraph Company for infringing on what they considered a monopoly grant. The suit was upheld by the California Supreme Court.
Mergers.
Soon after the lawsuit, the Alta Telegraph Company decided to merge into the California State Telegraph Company, which itself was eventually incorporated into the nationwide Western Union.

St. Gabriel's Roman Catholic Church (Bronx, New York)

St. Gabriel's Roman Catholic Church is a parish located in the Riverdale section of The Bronx, New York. The parish was created in 1939 by Francis Spellman, then the Archbishop of New York, as the successor to the St. Gabriel’s Church on East 37th Street in Manhattan, which was razed in 1937 to accommodate the construction of the Queens-Midtown tunnel. The pews, altars and statues of the original church were relocated to the new structure, and many of the church’s Irish-American congregants also moved to the Bronx to be near their parish. The Right Reverend Francis W. Walsh, pastor of the Church of the Assumption in Peekskill, New York, and president of the College of New Rochelle, was named pastor – a post he held until his retirement in 1969.
The St. Gabriel's complex encompasses a church, elementary school and rectory. In 2004, St. Gabriel’s was at the center of a zoning debate when a real estate developer unsuccessfully attempted to pay $7.2 million to build a new church and rectory and to renovate the church's school in exchange for the sale of air rights to build a 30-story condominium on the site of the rectory.

2008–09 York University Strike

The 2008–09 York University Strike was a strike by CUPE Local 3903, the union representing contract professors, teaching assistants, and graduate assistants at York University. The strike began on November 6, 2008 and concluded on January 29, 2009 when the provincial parliament legislated the union back to work. The strike lasted for 85 days, making it the longest faculty strike in Canadian University history. However though, 5000 students, including the Schulich School of Business and the Osgoode Hall Law School, were able to return to school a week prior to the end of the strike due to a deal struck by the union and the university. Whether it be returning to school a week in advance or amongst the vast majority, students and professors all return with strong resentment. Much of the criticism focused on York University President Mamdouh Shoukri's poor handling of the dispute.
The Union went on strike due to a variety of institutional grievances, including job security for contract professors, elimination of the Non-Academic Student Code of Conduct, creation of whistleblower protection, and fund indexation. On January 20, 2009, CUPE 3903 defeated a forced ratification vote that would have ended the strike. On January 24, Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty announced a rare Sunday recall of the provincial legislature in order to pass back-to-work legislation mandating an immediate end to the strike. On January 29, the York University Labour Disputes Resolution Act was passed in the provincial parliament on a count of 42–8 ending the strike.
Past labour disruptions at York University.
York University has a history of faculty/TA strikes. In 1997, there was a faculty strike by YUFA that lasted seven weeks. At the time, this was the second longest strike in Canadian University history. Key issues in the strike included retirement, funding, and institutional governance. In 2001, TAs and contract faculty went on strike for 11 weeks, when the university broke its own record. The central issue in the 2001 disruption were the administration's proposed attempts to remove tuition indexation language.

Herbert Reynolds

Michael Elder Rourke (14 July 186726 August 1933), who assumed the pen name Herbert Reynolds in 1913, was an Irish-American lyricist.
Reynolds wrote the lyrics to Jerome Kern's first big hit, "They Didn't Believe Me", interpolated into the 1914 American version of "The Girl from Utah", produced by Charles Frohman. The show had a successful run of 140 performances at the Knickerbocker Theatre, opening on August 14, 1914. Frohman had hired the young Kern to write five new songs for the score together with Reynolds to strengthen what he felt was a weak first act. Julia Sanderson and Donald Brian starred in the production. 
He shared the lyric writing with P. G. Wodehouse in "Miss Springtime" (1916), with additional music by Kern. 
Reynolds went on to collaborate with Kern and several other lyricists in the Broadway musical "Very Good Eddie" with a book by Guy Bolton and Philip Bartholomae, and again in "Rock-a-Bye Baby" (1918).

A-Side.
Whilst most Gay dad Tracks were written with the band work together Joy! originates from a recording created by Cliff Jones ten years as a student at Durham University. The finished track combines Krautrockmetronomic beats, a fluid bass line and scruffy Guitar riffs with a plethora of synth effects ultimately ending with a gospel recital of the lyric "Goodbye my darling I'm ready to die". In a Sound on Sound interview, lead singer Cliff Jones described the song as sounding "like a record that was made 10 minutes in the future".

The State of Law Coalition ( "I'tilāf Dawlat al-Qānūn") also known as Rule of Law Coalition is an Iraqi political coalition formed for the Iraqi governorate elections, 2009 by Prime Minister of Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki and his Islamic Dawa Party.

Bodymoor Heath Training Ground

Bodymoor Heath Training Ground is Aston Villa Football Club's training ground, at Bodymoor Heath in the North Warwickshire district of Warwickshire, England.
The site was purchased from a farmer by the then Aston Villa Chairman Doug Ellis in the early 1970s.
The ground is situated near Fazeley, in the Tame Valley, by the side of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, a short distance from Drayton Manor Theme Park and Middleton Hall. It lies close to The Belfry Golf Club, Middleton Lakes RSPB reserve and Kingsbury Water Park, just a few hundred metres from the M42 link to Tamworth and Birmingham.
Many of the past and present Aston Villa players have taken up residence in the area, one of the more rural parts of the Midlands, enabling them speedy travel to training sessions.
Redevelopment.
Although Bodymoor Heath was state-of-the-art in the 1970s, well advanced from the previous training facility in Trinity Road, Aston, by the late 1990s the facilities had started to look dated. This prompted then-Villa manager John Gregory to criticise Ellis, stating that he believed he was "stuck in a time warp", citing the Chairman's reluctance to invest.
Planning permission has also been a significant problem in the club's intent to modernise both the training facilities and the ground itself, and it wasn't until November 2005 that Ellis and Aston Villa plc announced an £8 million redevelopment of Bodymoor in two phases which, it was said, would bring the now antiquated facilities up to the standard of the best in the world. Before the team's largely disappointing 2005-06 Premier League performance, Ellis had revealed that the club had budgeted for 10th-12th place. However, they finishing 16th, and as a result the development came to halt, having already been scaled down from its original plans.
Once Randy Lerner purchased the club in September 2006, the club announced that work on the redevelopment of Bodymoor Heath would continue but with revisions and upgrades of the original plans resulting in a doubling of the initial proposed costs . The new training ground, designed by HB Architects, was officially unveiled on 6 May 2007, with the Aston Villa squad moving in for the 2007-08 Season.

North Hills Village Shopping Center

North Hills Village Shopping Center is a retail complex on McKnight Road in Ross Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, owned by J.J. Gumberg Co. since 1986. It was opened as a strip mall in 1957, with Gimbels as its center piece anchor tenant. It was enclosed in 1976 before reverting to a strip mall in 1996.
In 1984, Gimbels department store, which had been in the complex for 27 years and was the largest store there, announced it would move into Ross Park Mall, then under construction, when its lease expired in 1986. Merchants expressed confidence that the mall would survive the loss although it might become a discount mall. It was confirmed in July 1987 that it would become a "value-orientated center" with four anchor stores: Burlington Coat Factory, Hills Department Stores, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. 
In 1996, renovation began on the south end of the mall to return it to a strip mall with large speciality stores that had entrances that opened directly onto the parking lot while the northern end of the mall was to remain enclosed; the mall would then have a total of of retail space. Further work took place to return the mall to a strip mall in 2005 with the mall's center court becoming part of a larger Burlington Coat Factory store. The size of the mall was then of gross leasable area with the anchor stores being Burlington Coat Factory, Kohl's, Shop 'n Save, Best Buy and Staples. Other stores in the mall included Taco Bell, Applebee's, Duro Cleaners and Millennium Oriental Buffet and 10 smaller stores. A new Target store was built in 2006 on the site vacated by Burlington Coat Factory.

Helen Zahavi (born 1966) is an English novelist and screenwriter born and educated in London. Her father came to Britain with the Polish Army during the Second World War and her mother's parents came from Odessa. Before becoming a writer Zahavi worked as a Russian translator, and has spent several years living in Paris.
Her first novel, "Dirty Weekend" (1991), caused a media storm on publication, and critical reaction was extreme and polarised. A half-page article in "The Sunday Times" questioning the book's morality and the author's sanity set the tone for much of the press comment that followed. The book was attacked by Salman Rushdie, defended by Naomi Wolf, and analysed at length in both the broadsheet and popular press. Despite initial media hostility, the book went on to be a bestseller in the UK and Europe. 
"Dirty Weekend" has been translated into thirteen languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Czech and Korean. It was shortlisted for the Whitbread First Novel Award and adapted into a film by Michael Winner, the director of "Death Wish". Zahavi has a screen credit as co-writer and appeared with Winner on an edition of the Channel 4 discussion programme "After Dark" alongside, among others, the father of the so-called Yorkshire Ripper.
She has written three further novels, "True Romance" (1994) "Donna and the Fatman" (1998), and "Brighton Boy" (2013) which have been widely reviewed and translated.

Quarter-to-date

Quarter-to-date (QTD) is a period starting at the beginning of the current quarter and ending at the current date. Quarter-to-date is used in many contexts, mainly for recording results of an activity in the time between a date (exclusive, since this day may not yet be "complete") and the beginning of either the calendar or fiscal quarter.
In the context of finance, QTD is often provided in financial statements detailing the performance of a business entity. Providing current QTD results, as well as QTD results for one or more past quarters as of the same date, allows owners, managers, investors, and other stakeholders to compare the company's current performance to that of past periods.
QTD describes the return so far this quarter. For example: the quarter to date (quarter) return for the stock is 8%. This means from the beginning of the current quarter until the current date, stock has appreciated by 8%.
Comparing QTD measures can be misleading if not much of the quarter has occurred, or the date is not clear. QTD measures are more sensitive to early changes than late changes.

Howard R. Barr

Howard R. Barr (1910–2002) was a prominent twentieth-century architect in Austin, Texas. He received his degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1934. Upon graduation, he worked in the University architect’s office, where his first project was the design of housing units for the new U.T. observatory in West Texas. 
In 1939 he began the private practice of architecture but, with the U.S. entry into the World War, he became associated with Brown Shipbuilding Co. in the design of the shipyard and the construction of ships in Houston. Commissioned in the U.S. Naval Reserve in November 1942, he served in active duty for three years and later took inactive duty retirement with the rank of Lt. Commander. 
Upon his return to civilian life he re-opened his architectural office but shortly joined the firm of Giesecke, Kuehne and Brooks, Max Brooks being his former classmate and close friend. After Mr. Giesecke’s death in 1950, the firm of Kuehne, Brooks and Barr was formed and it—and its successor firms of Brooks and Barr and Brooks, Barr, Graeber & White (BBGW)—became one of Austin’s largest and best-known firms of its time. In addition to serving for five years as consulting architects for the University of Texas System, the firm—either singly or in joint venture with other firms—designed such buildings as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum in Austin, the U.S. Embassy office building in Mexico City, the United States Department of Labor headquarters in Washington, DC, the U.S. Federal Office and Post Office Building in Austin, the University of Texas Medical School in Houston and in San Antonio, the Alan Shivers State Office Building in Austin, and research and medical facilities throughout the U.S. and in Panama and Puerto Rico. (Some of the architectural drawings for Brooks, Barr, Graeber, and White's buildings are archived in the Austin History Center, Austin, Texas.)
One of the firm's projects was to design the original complex of buildings at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Space Center for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) when even the scientists who were to develop the moon shots did not know what type of building they would need.
In 1972, BBGW merged with Houston architects and engineers to form Diversified Design Disciplines, or 3D/International, and began a period of major planning of buildings and towns in Saudi Arabia and the Arab Emirates. Its most challenging project was the design of a summer palace for the King of Saudi Arabia.
In 1978 he retired from 3D/I and began a private consulting practice. Later he joined his son Alan Barr’s architectural firm, White, Dolce and Barr, as a resident consultant, where he maintained his office until his death. Most of his consulting was pro bono work for his church, charitable organizations, and friends.
Howard was always active in professional and community affairs. While at the University, he was elected to Tau Sigma Delta, the national honorary architectural fraternity. He was a member and president of both the Austin Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the Texas Society of Architects (TSA); served on the national Board of the AIA, received the TSA Medal for Lifetime Achievement, and was elected to Fellowship in the AIA. He served as architect member of the Texas State Board of Plumbing Examiners, member of the City of Austin Parks and Recreation Board, the Board of the Austin Chamber of Commerce, and the Austin Cerebral Palsy Center. He was a long-time member of the Austin Kiwanis Club and served as its president. In 1980 he became a member of the Advisory Council of the Lifetime Learning Institute of Austin and served as its director for four years. He was always an active member of the University United Methodist Church and served on many of its boards and committees.

<doc id="21428987" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21428987" title="Taiping Heavenly Kingdom">
Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom () was an oppositional state in China from 1851 to 1864, established by Hóng Xiùquán, the leader of the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864). Its capital was at Tianjing (),which is present-day Nanjing.
A convert to Christianity, Hong Xiuquan led an army that controlled some parts of southern China, with about 30 million people. The rebel Kingdom announced social reforms and the replacement of the powers of Confucianism, Buddhism and Chinese folk religion by his form of Christianity, holding that Hong Xiuquan was the second Son of God and the younger Brother of Jesus. The Taiping areas were besieged by Qing forces throughout most of the rebellion. The Qing government defeated the rebellion with the eventual aid of French and British forces.
History of the Taiping Rebellion.
Origins of the Rebellion.
In the mid-19th century, China under the Qīng Dynasty suffered a series of natural disasters, economic problems, and defeats at the hands of the Western powers; in particular, the humiliating defeat in 1842 by the United Kingdom in the First Opium War. The war disrupted shipping patterns and threw many out of work. It was these disaffected who flocked to join the charismatic visionary Hóng Xiùquán.
Missionaries working with native Chinese speakers published a series of introductory Christian tracts, one of which Hong came across, though he apparently did not read at first. After Hong failed to pass the examinations that would have made him one of the elite, he had a delirious dream or a vision in which he was greeted by a golden-haired, bearded man who presented him with a sword, and a younger man whom he addressed as "Elder Brother." For six more years Hong worked in the village as a tutor, then failed the exams a fourth time before opening the tracts again. He then realized the meaning of his dream: he was the younger brother of Jesus and had met Jehovah. He now felt it was his duty to spread Christianity and overthrow the foreign rule of the Qing. He was joined by Yáng Xiùqīng, a former charcoal and firewood salesman of Guăngxī, who claimed to be able to act as a voice of God to direct the people and gain political power. 
Fēng Yúnshān formed the Society of God Worshippers (), in Guăngxī province after a missionary journey there in 1844 to spread Hong's ideas. In 1847 Hong become the leader of the secret society. The sect's power grew in the late 1840s, initially suppressing groups of bandits and pirates, but persecution by Qing authorities spurred the movement into a guerrilla rebellion and then into civil war.
Establishment of the Kingdom.
The Taiping Rebellion began in 1851 in Guangxi Province. After minor clashes, the violence escalated into the Jintian Uprising in February 1851, in which a ten thousand-strong rebel army routed and defeated a smaller Qing force. On February 11, 1851 (the 11th day of the 1st lunar month), incidentally Hong Xiuquan's birthday, Hong declared himself "Heavenly King" () of a new dynasty, the "Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace". 
Capital at Tianjing (Nanjing).
In 1853 the Taiping forces captured Nanjing, making it their capital and renaming it "Tianjing", "Heavenly Capital". Hong built his Palace of Heavenly King there by converting the Office of the Viceroy of Liangjiang.
At its height, the Heavenly Kingdom controlled south China, centered on the fertile Yangtze river valley. Control of the river meant that the Taipings could easily supply their capital. From there, the Taipings sent armies west into the upper reaches of the Yangtze, and north to capture the Imperial capital of Beijing. The attempt to take Beijing failed.
Internal conflict.
In 1853 Hong withdrew from active control of policies and administration, ruling exclusively by written proclamations often in religious language. Hong disagreed with Yang in certain matters of policy and became increasingly suspicious of Yang's ambitions, his extensive network of spies, and his declarations when "speaking as God". Yang and his family were put to death by Hong's followers in 1856, followed by the killing of troops loyal to Yang.
With their leader largely out of the picture, Taiping delegates tried to widen their popular support with the Chinese middle classes and forge alliances with European powers, but failed on both counts. The Europeans decided to stay neutral. Inside China, the rebellion faced resistance from the traditionalist middle class because of their hostility to Chinese customs and Confucian values. The land-owning upper class, unsettled by the Taipings' peasant mannerisms and their policy of strict separation of the sexes, even for married couples, sided with the Imperial forces and their Western allies.
In 1859 Hong Rengan, a cousin of Hong, joined the Taiping in Nanjing, and was given considerable power by Hong. He developed an ambitious plan to expand the Kingdom's boundaries. In 1860 the Taiping were successful in taking Hangzhou and Suzhou to the east (See also: Second rout of the Army Group Jiangnan), but failed to take Shanghai, which marked the beginning of the decline of the Kingdom.
The fall of the Kingdom.
An attempt to take Shanghai in August 1860 was initially successful but finally repulsed by a force of Chinese troops and European officers under the command of Frederick Townsend Ward. This army would later become the "Ever Victorious Army", led by "Chinese" Gordon, and would be instrumental in the defeat of the Taiping rebels. Imperial forces were reorganized under the command of Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang, and the Imperial reconquest began in earnest. By early 1864 Imperial control in most areas was well established.
Hong declared that God would defend Nanjing, but in June 1864, with Imperial forces approaching, he died of food poisoning as the result of eating wild vegetables as the city began to run out of food. He was sick for twenty days before the Imperial forces could take the city. Only a few days after his death the Imperial forces took the city. His body was buried and was later exhumed by the conquering Zeng to verify his death, and cremated. Hong's ashes were later blasted out of a cannon in order to ensure that his remains have no resting place as eternal punishment for the uprising.
Four months before the fall of the Heavenly Kingdom of Taiping, Hong Xiuquan abdicated in favour of Hong Tianguifu, his eldest son, fifteen years old. Hong Tianguifu was unable to do anything to restore the Kingdom, so the Kingdom was quickly destroyed when Nanjing fell in July 1864 to the Imperial armies after vicious street-by-street fighting. Most of the so-called princes were executed by Qing Imperials in Jinling Town (), Nanjing.
Although the fall of Nanjing in 1864 marked the destruction of the Taiping regime, the fight was not yet over. There were still several hundreds Taiping rebel troops continuing the fight. It would take seven years to finally put down all remnants of the Taiping Rebellion. In August 1871 the last Taiping rebel army, led by Shi Dakai's commander, General Li Fuzhong (), was completely wiped out by the Imperial forces in the border region of Hunan, Guizhou and Guangxi.
The Heavenly Kingdom's policies.
Within the land that it controlled, the Taiping Heavenly Army established a theocratic and highly militarized rule.
Theology.
The movement's founder, Hong Xiuquan, had tried and failed to earn his "shengyuan" civil service degree numerous times. After one such failure in 1836, Hong overheard a Chinese Protestant missionary (Liang Fa) preaching and took home some Chinese translations of Bible tracts which had been translated by Robert Morrison, including a pamphlet titled "Good Words for Exhorting the Age" by Liang Fa. "Hong and his cousin were both baptized in accordance with Liang's directions. The missionary was probably Edwin Stevens of New England, who operated illegally in China. In 1843, after Hong's final failure at the exams, he had what some regard as a nervous breakdown and others as a mystical revelation, connecting his in-depth readings of the Christian tracts to strange dreams he had been having for the past six years. In his dreams, a bearded man with golden hair and a black robe called himself Jehovah, gave him a sword, and taught him to slay demons beside a younger man whom Hong addressed as "Elder Brother".
Hong Xiuquan came to believe that the figures in his dreams were God the Father and Jesus Christ the Son, and that they were revealing his destiny as a slayer of demons and the leader of a new Heavenly Kingdom on Earth. The demons were later interpreted by him to be the Qing and false religions.
Hong developed a literalist understanding of the Bible, producing a set of his own annotations. He rejected the doctrine of the Trinity, saying "God is the Father and embodies myriads of phenomena; Christ is the Son, who was manifest in the body... The Wind of the Holy Spirit, God, is also a Son... God is one who gives shapes to things, molds things into forms, who created heaven and created earth, who begins and ends all things, yet has no beginning or end himself..." and "God and the Savior are one."
Currency.
In its first year, the Heavenly Kingdom minted coins that were 23 mm to 26 mm in diameter, weighing around 4.1 g. The kingdom's name was inscribed on the obverse and "Holy Treasure" () on the reverse. The kingdom also issued paper notes, at least one of which is on the internet (dated 1861).

Ranked below the "King of Heaven" Hong Xiuquan, the territory was divided among provincial rulers called kings or princes; initially there were fivethe Kings of the Four Quarters and the King of the "Yi" ("flanks"). Of the original rulers, the West King and South King were killed in combat in 1852. The East King was murdered by the North King during a "coup d'état" in 1856, and the North King himself was subsequently killed. The kings' names were:

Intelligent word recognition

Intelligent Word Recognition, or IWR, is the recognition of unconstrained handwritten words. IWR recognizes entire handwritten words or phrases instead of character-by-character, like its predecessor, Optical Character Recognition (OCR). IWR technology matches handwritten or printed words to a user-defined dictionary, significantly reducing character errors encountered in typical character-based recognition engines. 
New technology on the market utilizes IWR, OCR, and ICR together, which opens many doors for the processing of documents, either constrained (hand printed or machine printed) or unconstrained (freeform cursive). IWR also eliminates a large percentage of the manual data entry of handwritten documents that, in the past, could only be keyed by a human, creating an automated workflow.
When cursive handwriting is in play, for each word analyzed, the system breaks down the words into a sequence of graphemes, or subparts of letters. These various curves, shapes and lines make up letters and IWR considers these various shape and groupings in order to calculate a confidence value associated with the word in question.
IWR is not meant to replace ICR and OCR engines which work well with printed data; however, IWR reduces the number of character errors associated with these engines, and it is ideal for processing real-world documents that contain mostly freeform, hard-to-recognize data, inherently unsuitable for them.

1974 Nigerien coup d'état

The 1974 Nigerien coup d'état was a largely bloodless military insurrection which overthrew the first postcolonial government of the West African nation of Niger. The government that followed, while plagued by coup attempts of its own, survived until 1991. 
On 15 April 1974, Lieutenant-Colonel Seyni Kountché led a military coup that ended the fourteen-year rule of Niger's first President, Hamani Diori. Diori was imprisoned until 1980 and remained under house arrest. The military coup began at 1 AM on the morning of 15 April, with all but a handful of units quickly declaring for the coup leaders. The personal guard of President Hamani Diori, the all-Tuareg "Guarde Republicain" was the only unit to resist, under the orders of Diori's wife Senia. She and an unknown number of Guardsmen were killed at the presidential palace after dawn on 15 April.
The Sahel drought of 1968-1972 had aggravated existing tensions in the single party government of the ruling PPN. Widespread civil disorder followed allegations that some government ministers were misappropriating stocks of food aid and accused Diori of consolidating power. Diori limited cabinet appointments to fellow Djerma, family members, and close friends. In addition, he acquired new powers by declaring himself the minister of foreign and defense affairs.
Kountché's first official acts were to suspend the Constitution, dissolve the National Assembly, ban all political parties, and release political prisoners. A Supreme Military Council (CMS) was established on 17 April 1974 with Kountché as president. Its stated mandate was to distribute food aid fairly and to restore morality to public life. A consultative National Council for Development (CND) replaced the National Assembly. Although political parties were outlawed, opposition activists who were exiled during Diori's regime were allowed to return to Niger.
While a period of relative prosperity, the military government of the period allowed little free expression and engaged in arbitrary imprisonment and killing. The first presidential elections took place in 1993 (33 years after independence), and the first municipal elections only took place in 2007.

Pachypleurosaurus

Pachypleurosaurus (meaning 'thick rib lizard') is a genus of pachypleurosaurian that lived during the Triassic Period. It was a basal sauropterygian, and had a long neck. The type species is "P. edwardsi".
This aquatic animal was a nothosaur, an early relative of the plesiosaurs and placodonts. In contrast to the highly modified paddles of plesiosaurs, pachypleurosaurs had hands and feet that were still very similar to those of land-dwelling tetrapods. It is likely that undulations of its backbone provided the main propulsive force for swimming. Like other nothosaurs, "Pachypleurosaurus" was a marine animal that probably lived on fish or small invertebrates.

Lovely Lane Methodist Church

Lovely Lane United Methodist Church, formerly known as First Methodist Episcopal Church, is a historic United Methodist church located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It was designed by renowned architect Stanford White (1853–1906) in 1884, built in the Romanesque Revival style. It is patterned after the early churches and basilicas in Ravenna, Italy. The exterior is constructed of a gray ashlar granite with limited ornamentation. It features a square bell tower patterned after the campanile of the 12th-century church of Santa Maria, Abbey of Pomposa, near Ravenna. The pulpit is a reproduction of the one at St. Apollinaris, in Ravenna.
As the continuation of the former Lovely Lane Chapel or Meeting House, the scene of the Christmas Conference, it is also known as the Mother Church of American Methodism. (The site of the original chapel was abandoned in 1786, being replaced (first) by the Merchants Club and by the present-day Baltimore International College.)
Charles L. Carson was supervising architect for Stanford White in construction of the church. Lovely Lane Methodist Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Rescue Water Craft Background History
The United States paved the way for using personal watercraft for rescues and patrols. In water rescue applications, they are referred to as 'rescue water craft' (RWC). This began in the late 1970s through the efforts of Kawasaki Motors Corporation U.S.A. The origin of water rescue using PWC's is attributed to these founding fathers: Brad Southworth and Ronny Kling. Former Vietnam Veterans and racers whom were asked by Chuck Koontz to provide a rescue application using stand up Jet Skis for the United States Jet Ski Association, which later became the International Jet Sports Boating Association. In 1985 Brad and Ronny began using the 'Fun Tech Wedge' on stand ups, a plastic form that fit around the circumference of the craft making it a more stable rescue platform. From the Fun Tech Wedge, backboards, litters, modified paddle, body boards, and lines taken to victims were utilized as transport devices. In the late 1980s rescue board designs adapted to the changing hull designs when two to three seater craft became available. This became common use for extrication of patients. 
The first agencies to receive Jet Skis were Long Beach and Huntington Beach City Lifeguard departments in California. Brad Southworth and Steve Strickland were hired by Kawasaki on a 'Tropical Tan Tour' to go to lifeguard agencies on the East and West coasts for the purpose of using them on their beaches. Few agencies during this time applied the stands ups to actual rescue safety applications, but the product was given exposure at local beaches to the public. 
The pioneering agencies who have the longest standing tradition of PWC in the United States are Kill Devil Hills Lifeguard Beach Service from North Carolina on the Outer Banks and Taft-Nelson-Delake (TND) Volunteer Fire Rescue Squad out of Lincoln City, Oregon, USA. Both began in the late 1970s and have the distinction of the origins of our PWC rescue heritage. TND incorporated into 'North Lincoln Fire and Rescue' and both agencies are still using Personal Water Craft in 2010 for operations, over 30 years. In the late 1980s the feasibility of using Jet Skis for rescues began to take on interest from lifeguards and law enforcement. In 1989 Shawn Alladio began teaching under the name 'Watercraft Awareness Safety Program', after a 10-year development of training concepts and to preserve local riding areas in Southern California. Due to the rapid growth of PWC, her professional development was launched as the product sales increased. This program was eventually named K38 Water Safety. In 1990, the Personal Watercraft Industry Association created the 'Wave Rangers' program to expose law enforcement to these boats in the United States, this lasted a few seasons.
In 2008 Shawn Alladio was invited onto the PWCoffshore.com point-to-point personal water craft endurance race team competing on long distance races called offshore powerboat racing under American Power Boat Association sanctioning. Shawn's first buoy race was in 1980, she has celebrated 30 years of PWC competition, focusing on Offshore and Endurance events, training racers and safety teams for these events. Shawn has competed in offshore PWC racing events ranging from 1,6000 miles to 60 miles since 1989. Such as the LB2CAT a long standing race event from Long Beach, California to Catalina Island, Avalon and back to Long Beach, and the Mark Hahn 300 a 300-mile memorial endurance race. Personal Water Craft racing incorporates many different disciplines, such as Closed Course, Obstacle, Sprints, Ovals, Offshore, Endurance, Raids, Slalom, Gran Prix, and Enduros.
In 2011, K38 partnered with the Phoenix Patriot Foundation to create the Phoenix 500 Races and the Purple Heart Patriots PWC Challenge which includes Military personnel who have received the Purple Heart in Afghanistan or Iraq. These Military personnel operate Kawasaki Jet Ski watercraft in offshore and endurance race events. The PPF directly supports severely wounded veterans enabling them to fully recover, reintegrate and remain engaged in serving America.
Shawn Alladio and K38 Water Safety received the 2005 National Water Safety Congress and National Safe Boating Council Nation Awards for reducing/preventing drowning's across the United States.
The IJSBA 2006 International Jet Sports Boating Association Hall of fame inaugural induction included Shawn Alladio as one of the original 25 recipients for her dedication to the sport.
"National Water Safety Congress Award

In 1999, Shawn received the Regional Award for her efforts in education to reduce drownings and educational efforts for the personal watercraft boating community."
In 2006, Shawn Alladio from K38 was awarded a Special Commendation for relief work in the aftermath of 2005 Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans from the Higgins and Langley Memorial Awards for flood and swiftwater rescue. K38 supported 8 California urban search and rescue and rescue teams with human evacuations recovering over 2,500 persons. K38 was noted for animal rescue efforts using Jet Skis.
K38 awards
In 2009, the City of Mission Viejo in California awarded Shawn a certificate of heroism for her actions on I-5 freeway. Shawn received 1st and 2nd degree burns to her hands and stomach. Masahito Matasuura received 3rd degree burns, resulting in numerous surgeries. He recovered from the extent of his burns covering over 30% of his body.

Protosiren

Protosiren (taxonomic family Protosirenidae) is an extinct early genus of the order Sirenia. "Protosiren" existed throughout the Lutetian and Bartonian stages of the Middle Eocene. Its geographic distribution was intercontinental: fossils have been found in the United States (North Carolina), Egypt, France, Hungary, India, and Pakistan. Like the extant sirenians (manatee and dugong), "Protosiren" is thought to have fed on sea grasses as well as freshwater plants. Unlike extant sirenians, "Protosiren" had hind limbs. Although the limbs were well-developed, they were small and the sacroiliac joint was weak. Consequently, "Protosiren" is thought to have been mainly aquatic.
It rarely ventured on land.

Christmas Special (TV special)

Christmas Special is the sixth episode and the first holiday special on the part documentary and part rock-mockumentary musical comedy series "The Naked Brothers Band," which was created by Polly Draper. The premise of "Christmas Special" is that Nat has the holiday blues since Rosalina's letters from abroad have a steadily decreasing number of X's and O's. He has to find his spirit back in time before a benefit that is hosted by Whoopi Goldberg.
Plot.
If Nat doesn't find something to give him the Christmas spirit, it could ruin a benefit the band is holding for "Save the Children", which is hosted by Whoopi Goldberg. Meanwhile, Alex is in a competition with the adorable Timmerman Brothers to create the world's worst online Christmas video. 
Later on during the "Save the Children" benefit, Nat bumps into a Leon Williams (Leon G. Thomas III) who he told him about his love problem. He replied, "Hey man, you can't mess your love with X's". Whoopi Goldberg makes an announcement and introduces Leon Williams who talks about how he and his family is poor—he and his family have lived without a roof over their head, have gone without food, but never lost hope. During Leon's speech, Nat gets his Christmas spirit back and writes a song called "Yes We Can", which he sings with Natasha Bedinfield and Leon Williams to end the benefit. After the benefit, Nat sends Rosalina an email postcard with three X's and when Rosalina replies, she replies with three X's. It puts Nat in a good mood.
Production.
In real life, Nat Wolff was inspired by president Barack Obama, while he was running for office, to re-compose the song "Yes We Can". Nat got to speak with Obama's two daughters on the phone. Nat Wolff's mom and the series' creator Polly Draper wrote this episode based around his song. Polly got Whoopi Goldberg to be in it, since Whoopi Goldberg and Sherri Shepherd interviewed the band after they performed "I'm Out" on ABC's "The View" that was on February 2008. "Save The Children" is a real charity, which on the end of the ending credits of the show gave you information about contacting them.

Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival of Greater Philadelphia

The annual Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival of Greater Philadelphia is a spring celebration commemorating Japan’s 1926 gift of 1,600 flowering trees to the City of Philadelphia as a gesture of goodwill. The festival is a series of events spread over two months, with the centerpiece culture fair celebration “Sakura Sunday” taking place in Fairmount Park at the site of the historic cherry blossom tree plantings.
History.
In honor of the 150th anniversary of American independence and as a gesture of goodwill, the Japanese government donated 1,600 cherry trees and other flowering trees to the City of Philadelphia in 1926. 
In 1998, continuing the legacy of the original gift of trees, the Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia made a 10-year pledge to plant 1,000 new cherry blossom trees in Philadelphia. About 250 people attended a dinner at Fairmount Park’s Memorial Hall to help fund the costs of buying and planting the first 100 of Philadelphia’s new cherry trees. Following that, there was a tree planting ceremony to celebrate the installation of the new cherry trees. 
The cherry tree planting and fundraising continued for a few years at the same modest level, staying mostly within the Japanese and Japanese-American community in Philadelphia. The celebrations were lively but intimate, as the cherry tree planting project had not yet entered the public’s awareness. 
As the number of cherry blossom trees grew and the tree planting project began to attract more attention, Philadelphia started to become recognized a suitable venue for a Japanese style celebration of spring. In 2003, Subaru of America, Inc., located just across the river in Cherry Hill, NJ, increased its support of the cherry tree planting project with title sponsorship, and the Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival of Greater Philadelphia was born. Two days of events expanded to one full week, and grew again in 2005 to two whole weeks of Japanese cultural festivities. 
Having completed the ten-year goal of 1,000 tree plantings in 2007, the Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia created a new 5-year plan to bring cherry blossom trees to 10 community parks throughout the City of Philadelphia. The Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival of Greater Philadelphia, now featuring more than 45 events attended by over 20,000 people, continues as a means of supporting the ongoing tree planting project, and moreover honoring and celebrating the Japanese government’s 1926 gift of goodwill and springtime festivity.
Events.
The Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival of Greater Philadelphia now features over 45 events inspired by the food, drink, dance, music, art, and culture of Japan. 
The Annual Gala is the fundraiser for the festival, with proceeds supporting the planting and maintenance of Philadelphia’s cherry blossom trees. 
Sakura Sunday, an outdoor Japanese cultural fair that takes place at the Horticulture Center in Fairmount Park, is the festival’s largest event. Family and friends come together under the blossoms to experience performances, meet visitors from Japan, and watch the Festival tree planting ceremony.

Rongotai College

Rongotai College is a state single-sex boys secondary school located in the eponymous south-eastern suburb of Wellington, New Zealand. Serving Years 9 to 13 (ages 13 to 18), the school has a roll of 602 students as of April 2013.
About 40 per cent of the students are of European heritage, 20 per cent identify as Pasifika, 15 per cent Maori and there are various Middle Eastern, Asian and African students.
A highlight for the school is the annual McEvedy Shield athletics event.
Location.
The school stands on the isthmus separating Lyall Bay and Cook Strait to the south from Evans Bay on Wellington Harbour to the north. It thus has the sea on two sides, and this gives it a particularly bracing microclimate, with gusty winds from the north and, in winter, icy blasts from the south. It is bounded to the east by Wellington Airport. Wellington's city centre is a few kilometres to the north-west.
History.
Rongotai College was opened in 1928 with Mr Fritz Martyn Renner as its first headmaster and a teaching staff of seven. It was started as an "overspill" for Wellington College, which was overstretched, and Rongotai became the new school for Wellington boys in the eastern suburbs.
Rongotai College originally accepted enrolments from students of intermediate school age. However, when Evans Bay Intermediate School opened its doors in 1964, the school became purely a secondary school, catering for young men in what are now called years 9 to 13.
The Assembly Hall, known as the Renner Hall, was opened in 1968 and is named after the founding headmaster.
Houses.
The four houses at Rongotai College are named after the school's first four headmasters:

Stu Foord

Stu Foord (born September 23, 1985 in Regina, Saskatchewan) is a Canadian football running back for the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League. He was originally signed by the Saskatchewan Roughriders as an undrafted free agent in 2008. Before joining the Roughriders, Foord played five years for the Regina Thunder of the Prairie Football Conference.
Football career.
Amateur.
Foord played high school football for Thom Collegiate in Regina. After finishing his high school career, he played junior football for the Regina Thunder of the Prairie Football Conference. Foord was invited to the Saskatchewan Roughriders training camp after the 2006 season, but was cut due to a combination of on-field performance and off-field issues. He returned to play for the Thunder during the 2007 season, where he was ranked among the PFC's top five in all-purpose yards, kick return yards, punt return yards, rushing, receiving and punt returns. Foord was named the Thunder's most valuable player after his last two seasons with the club.
Professional.
After the 2007 season, Foord received another invitation to the Roughriders' training camp. After a much improved performance, on and off the field, he was placed on the team's waived / injured list, but was signed to the team's 42 man roster after an injury to Chris Szarka. He made his debut with the Roughriders during Week 2 of the 2008 CFL season, against the BC Lions. Foord was named the CFL's Canadian Player of the Week on September 24, 2008 for his performance against the BC Lions. He scored a touchdown on his first ever rushing attempt in the CFL, and also had a receiving touchdown later in the game. Of his rushing touchdown, Foord said "I knew that I would be so jacked up that if anything was there, I was going to take it. I did that and now I can say my first touch was a touchdown." Foord finished the 2008 season with three touchdowns (two rushing and one receiving).
During the 2009 CFL season, Foord dressed for every Roughrider game, including the West Final and the Grey Cup. He was one of the team's backup running backs, and also saw time on special teams, including returning kickoffs. Foord scored a single rushing touchdown during the 2009 season. In the offseason, Foord signed a new contract with the Roughriders.
On February 16, 2012, Foord signed with the BC Lions as a free agent.
Personal life.
Foord lives in Regina year round. During the off-season, he trains with former Roughrider Dan Farthing. Foord was planning to continue his football career and education at either the University of Regina or the University of Manitoba if he was unable to make the jump to the professional ranks after his junior football eligibility was exhausted. During the offseason, prior to the 2010 CFL season, Foord vacationed in Mexico and learned to surf.

Rob Bagg

Rob Bagg (born February 3, 1985 in Kingston, Ontario) is a Canadian football wide receiver for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League.
High School.
Bagg attended Frontenac Secondary School in Kingston, Ontario from 1999 to 2003. After running for the cross-country team in grades 9 and 10, new to the sport of football at age 16, Bagg joined the Frontenac Falcons Senior Football Team in his grade 11 year. Sporting the school's garnet and grey colours, Bagg helped the team to win not only their division finals (EOSSA), but also the Provincial finals (OFSAA) at the National Capital Bowl in the then 'Sky Dome', now the Rogers Centre in both of his senior years.
College career.
In 2003, Bagg attended Queen's University, joining the school's football team that same year. In 2005, he played in six games, recording 17 catches for 166 yards as well as returning seven punts for 157 yards and six kickoffs for 67 yards. In 2006, Bagg played in all eight games and ranked 12th in the country in receiving yards, recording 30 receptions for 565 yards and four touchdowns. He was also featured more on special teams, returning 58 punts for 412 yards and 13 kickoffs for 328 yards.
After the 2006 season concluded, Bagg went undrafted in the 2007 CFL Draft. He was high on the Saskatchewan Roughriders list, but with only two draft picks and already selecting receiver David McKoy, they did not draft him. Instead, he signed with the team shortly after the draft and attended the 2007 training camp with the Roughriders. After making the roster, he declined the position in order to return to the Gaels for a fifth season. The Roughriders would win the Grey Cup that year.
For the Golden Gaels' 2007 season, Bagg led the team in receiving, and was fifth in the country, playing in seven games with 36 catches for 804 yards and six touchdowns. That includes a 341-yard receiving game against the Toronto Varsity Blues where he also caught three touchdown passes. This single game performance is the second most receiving yards in a game in CIS history, behind former Queen's recevier James MacLean. Being the team's top receiver, he saw less time on special teams, returning 13 punts for 192 yards and six kickoffs for 130 yards.
Professional career.
Saskatchewan Roughriders.
On January 23, 2008, Bagg signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, the team that had expressed interest in him before the 2007 season. After again making the active roster out of training camp, Bagg dressed as a receiver for 16 games in 2008. After a plethora of injuries at the receiver position, Bagg was pressed into service during the Banjo Bowl versus the Winnipeg Blue Bombers where he recorded his first CFL reception and finished the game with six catches for 52 yards in the Roughriders' comeback win. He had an explosive game against Montreal where he had six catches for 146 yards, including a 72-yard reception, and was named the CFL’s Canadian Player of the Week. He finished the regular season with 22 catches for 371 yards. His debut season was peculiarly marked by his bad luck near the end zone. Bagg was stopped at the three-, two-, and one-yard lines after making catches, stopping just short of his first CFL touchdowns. He also had two catches for 18 yards in the Roughriders' West Semi-Final loss to the BC Lions.
With the Roughriders electing not to re-sign Corey Grant for the 2009 season, Bagg took over the wideside wide receiver spot he vacated. Bagg had a decent start to the season until he had a 120 yard receiving game against the BC Lions where he caught his first and second career CFL touchdowns, after meeting futility in 2008. After an injury to Weston Dressler in week 15, Bagg started at slotback the next week and shortside wide receiver the two weeks following, before finishing the season at his familiar wideside spot. Showcasing his versatility, he had another 100-yard receiving game against BC while at the shortside receiver position with a season-high 124 yards and a touchdown. Finishing the season with 59 catches for 807 yards and five touchdowns, Bagg was named the Roughriders' nominee for Most Outstanding Canadian after his breakout year. Additionally, Bagg led the offense with six defensive tackles and had two special teams tackles and a forced fumble. In the West Final game, Bagg had three catches for 73 yards and a touchdown, while in the loss to Montreal in the 2009 Grey Cup, he recorded three receptions for 27 yards and one carry for 13 yards. In the 2010 season, in a game against the Calgary Stampeders Bagg had a season-ending injury, which also kept him out of all of the 2011 season. Just as it appeared as though Bagg was going to return to the Riders for the 2011 CFL season he re-injured his left ACL in off-season training, which caused him to miss the entire 2011 season. After recovering from injuring his left knee twice Bagg worked his way back into the lineup for the 2012 CFL season. However, he tore his right knee in Week 3 and had to once again miss the rest of a season due to surgery.
Bagg returned to the Riders lineup for the 2013 CFL season and earned Canadian Player of the Week honors for Week 4. In Week 3, Bagg had his first CFL touchdown since 2010, and in Week 4 had a 2 touchdown performance. However, in Week 8 against the Alouettes, Bagg injured his knee while blocking downfield on a running play. The extent of his knee injury was diagnosed as a 'knee sprain', he returned to the active roster after missing four games. By the close of the 2013 season Bagg played in 16 games of the regular season, recording 34 catches for 430 yards with 4 receiving touchdowns.
After the end of the season, Bagg signed a contract extension with the Roughriders, promising to keep him in Saskatchewan through the 2015 season.

2006 Kulgam massacre

2006 Kulgam massacre was the killing of nine Nepalese and Bihari labourers and a Muslim Kashmiri Indian Army soldier by Hizbul Mujahideen militants in a broad daylight near Yaripora in Kulgam area of Anantnag district in Kashmir on 12 June 2006. 
Background.
The labourers had come to Kashmir from Siliguri as they had heard that wages were good. They were hired to build a wall around a house in Hangalbuch. On the morning of the massacre it had been raining and they took an early break for lunch. A local Muslim Abdullah Teli was cooking lunch for them.
The Attack.
The seven unidentified gunmen wearing combat fatigues, kidnapped Mushtaq Ahmed Sheikh a newly recruited soldier of Rashtriya Rifles and thirteen Nepali and Bihari labourers. Later they tortured and beheaded Sheikh. The labourers were lined up and asked to undress. One of them Mahammad Naimuddin was identified as a Muslim and asked to step aside. Then the labourers were fired on indiscriminately leading to the death of nine of them. "I begged them not to do it," said Teli, breaking down as he recounts what happened in the minutes before the massacre. "I told them that these were simple working men who had done no wrong. But they just wouldn't listen. They marched out all those men, and a little while later, I heard the shots."
The aftermath.
300 Muslims of Kulgam witnessed the funerals. None of the prominent politicians were present. The police claimed that the Hizbul Mujahideen was believed to be responsible for the attack. However in 2007 Australian government in declaring Lashkar-e-Taiba a Terrorist organisation also attributed this massacre jointly to it.

St. John's Episcopal Church (Baltimore, Maryland)

St. John's Episcopal Church is a historic Episcopal church located on Old York Road (off Greenmount Avenue and 31st Street) in the former village of Huntingdon (now the community of Waverly in northeast Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The congregation is often referred to as St. John's of Huntingdon Episcopal Church. It is a Gothic Revival structure built originally in 1847. A bell tower was added in 1849. The church was rebuilt on the original walls and foundation after an 1858 fire. In 1878 additions to the rebuilt structure were made to the transepts and chancel. It is constructed of stone with granite and wood trim and Early English in style. This church building was consecrated in 1860. Also on the property is a cemetery.
St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
History.
The congregation of Saint John's Church - part of the Episcopal (or, Anglican) Church - has worshiped together on the same site since 1843. At that time the area now known as the Waverly and Charles Villages - the neighbourhood in northeastern Baltimore city ministered to by Saint John's Church - was actually the small village of Huntingdon, Maryland, a collection of about seventeen great estates and houses, and the more modest homes of a new and emerging middle class. (The estate names around Huntingdon village are synonymous with old Baltimore families: Montebello, Clover Hill, Homewood, Guilford, Greenmount, Abbottston (Gilman-Cate) and Homestead.)
The original village of "Huntingdon", which extended from Huntingdon Avenue (in the present day neighborhood of Remington) on the west to the Harford Road on the east; from Huntingdon Avenue (now 25th Street) on the south to Boundary Avenue (42nd Street) in the north, was annexed from Baltimore County to Baltimore City in 1888 and the post office was renamed Waverly, after Sir Walter Scott's 'Waverley' novels. The residential and commercial community of Peabody Heights (later renamed Charles Village in the 1960s) was created out of this area to the west in the 1870s, while the residential area of Waverly with its commercial district centering on Greenmount Avenue (southern city end of York Road and 33rd Street was in the east. Also to the northwest is the community of Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello which has a redevelopment umbrella organization combining various local neighborhood associations for cooperative efforts with offices centered at Baltimore City College. Also to the west is the redeveloped campus of the old Eastern High School, a distinctive landmark since 1938, now with offices for the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions since the 1990s.
In November 1843, the Reverend W. A. Hewitt was sent to the village of Huntingdon by Bishop Whittingham of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland at the request of one Mr Thomas Hart who wished to have some of his grandchildren baptised without making the journey to the parish church, Saint Paul's, in Baltimore. The bishop was eager to establish new congregations in Maryland which would embody the ideals of the Oxford Movement (which evolved from the Tractarian Movement), a spiritual-renewal movement making itself strongly felt throughout the Anglican Church in England and elsewhere. Saint John's Church was born with those baptisms and that spiritual renewal.
The first services were held in an old American Revolutionary War barracks located some thirty yards southwest of the present church building; on 10 July 1844, Saint John's Church was legally incorporated as a diocesan mission church within the bounds of Saint Paul's parish, and by 1845 it was an independent congregation. The congregation laid the cornerstone for its first church in April 1846 and saw its consecration by Bishop Whittingham on 11 November 1847. It was determined that the church should be a "free" church - there were to be no pew rents, ever.
For the first two years the rector returned his stipend to the treasurer as his offering toward the building expenses (he also installed the furnace at his own expense, ensuring the warm devotion and gratitude of his flock). However, in 15 May 1858, just eleven years after its consecration, this lovely new building was gutted by fire and burned to the ground.
The congregation was poorer, but undaunted, and the cornerstone of a new building, the present church, was laid on 11 September 1858 by the parish's faithful father in God, Bishop Whittingham. The first service in this building was held on 22 May 1859, and its consecration was on All Saints' Day, 1 November 1860. The congregation prospered, as did its parishioners, and a Parish House (1866) and a Rectory (1868) were added, all in matching "gothick" style.
The church, and for the most part the other buildings, were built according to the principles of the Cambridge(England) Ecclesiological Society, which devoted itself to the revival of the Gothic style in architecture and all the appurtenances appropriate to the style and dignity of that setting. The Oxford Movement brought with it a matching revival of dignity and ceremonial in the worship of the church, and the interior decoration reflected this influence.
The original church on this site, patterned after Saint Michael's, Longstanton, in England, was a pure example of English "country gothick," and this design involved a long nave, lancet windows, thick low medieval walls, and a high, steep-pitched roof. There was a south porch and relatively small sanctuary at the east end.
The present building preserved most of those features, and was enlarged in 1875, adding transepts (to create the classic cruciform shape evident today), a baptistry (the present Lady Chapel), sacristy, enlarged sanctuary, and a glorious bell tower and spire. The interior decoration was finally completed in 1895 in the same Victorian Gothic revival style.
After several "modernisations" of the decor, neglect, and eventual whitewash(!), the restoration of much of the original decoration was begun in 1983-85 by the Reverend R. Douglas Pitt, the eleventh rector. This work was resumed in 1994 under the Reverend Jesse L. A. Parker, twelfth rector, and continues as of this writing.

Weston Dressler

Weston Dressler (born June 14, 1985) is a professional American football Wide Receiver for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League. Dressler played for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League from 2008 to 2013. He was signed by the Roughriders as a street free agent in 2008. He played college football at the University of North Dakota.
Early years.
Dressler was born in Bismarck, North Dakota to Rick and Val Dressler. He attended Bismarck High School. At Bismarck he was a three time all-state and all-conference selection and in 2003 was named North Dakota Gatorade High School Player of the Year. On March 23, 2009, his Bismarck high school retired his jersey (#2).
He has two brothers, Travis and Ryan. His younger brother, Ryan, played wide receiver at The University of North Dakota from 2006-2010.
College career.
As a senior he caught 75 passes for 1,274 receiving yards while being named to the North Central Conference's all-star team for the fourth season in a row. After four seasons at the University of North Dakota, Dressler set 19 school records.
Professional career.
Saskatchewan Roughriders.
Dressler went undrafted in the 2008 NFL Draft and signed as a street free agent with the Saskatchewan Roughriders on May 13, 2008. After the Roughriders named their final cuts, Dressler was one of five rookies to make the final team. After two games with the Roughriders he led the league with 13 punt returns for 185 yards. However his receiving yards had been accidentally omitted by the CFL's statistical package. On July 14, Dressler suffered a hamstring injury that forced him out of the lineup. Towards the end of the season, Dressler was being considered as the leading candidate for the CFL West's nomination for rookie of the year. As of October 18, Dressler had 46 catches for 928 yards with five touchdowns including six 100+ yard games. On November 5, it became official and Dressler was nominated for rookie of the year. Dressler later won the award over Hamilton's Prechae Rodriguez. Dressler finished the season with a team-leading 1,123 yards receiving (11th overall) and 2,219 combined yards (3rd overall). At the end of the 2008 season, he was voted the most popular player by the fans. 
Ensuring that there would be no sophomore slump, Weston Dressler had the most receiving yards in a game in his young career catching seven passes for 154 yards against the BC Lions in the home opener. Because of his value as a receiver, the Roughrider coaching staff pulled him from the kick return game and only used him in critical situations on special teams. Ken Miller, the Saskatchewan head coach, and Paul LaPolice, the offensive coordinator, used many different formations in order to get Dressler the ball, from the slot back position, to wideout, to handoffs. On August 21, 2009, against the Montreal Alouettes, Dressler caught eight passes for 179 yards, his most yards gained in a single game to date. On Oct. 10, 2009, Dressler's season would come to a close as he sustained a sprained right ankle and fractured right fibula in the closing minutes of a win over the Toronto Argonauts, halting his receiving yardage total under 1000 yards.
In 2013, Dressler was a CFL All Star and won the 101st Grey Cup. On January 30, 2014, Dressler was released from the Saskatchewan Roughriders so he could sign with a National Football League team.
Kansas City Chiefs.
On February 5, 2014, Dressler signed a Future Free Agent contract with the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs.

James Barry, 1st Baron Barry of Santry

James Barry, 1st Baron Barry of Santry PC (Ire) (1603–1673) was an Irish lawyer, judge and peer.
Early life.
Barry was the son of Richard Barry and Anne Cusack, daughter of James Cusack of Rathgar. His father and grandfather were wealthy merchants of Dublin, his grandfather James Barry having been Sheriff of Dublin City, and his father Lord Mayor of Dublin and representative in the Irish House of Commons for Dublin. He married Catharine Parsons (daughter of Sir William Parsons and Elizabeth Lany), by whom he had four sons and four daughters.
He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, on 27 April 1621 with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). He gained a Master of Arts (M.A.) from Trinity College, Dublin, in June 1624.
Career.
He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 11 July 1621. In 1628 he served as a barrister, and he was Recorder of Dublin. Other appointments included Prime Sergeant, 6 October 1629. He was admitted to King's Inn, 15 April 1630, (he served twice as its Treasurer) and was Member of Parliament for Lismore in 1634.
He became second Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland), 5 August 1634, through the influence of Lord Wentworth. He published in 1637, at the request of Lord Wentworth, to whom he dedicated it, "The Case of Tenures upon the Commission of Defective Titles, argued by all the Judges of Ireland, with the Resolution and the Reasons of their Resolution". In 1640 he what influence he had, but in vain, with Sir James Ware and other members of the Irish House of Commons, to prevent their sending a committee of their body to England to impeach the Earl of Strafford, as Wentworth now was.
He was chairman of the Royalist Convention, 7 July 1659. This met at Dublin in defiance of the government. It voted the unconditional Restoration of Charles II. In November 1660, " in consideration of his many good services to Charles I and his eminent loyalty to Charles II", he became Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland, and Privy Counsellor. He was appointed a commissioner to execute the King's Declaration which ultimately led to the Act of Settlement 1662. He was accused, rather obscurely, of being " a cold friend" to the Declaration, and this, as well as his increasing infirmity, was one of the "material objections" which led to his being rejected as Speaker of the Irish House of Lords. However he did sit on the Lords Committee to consider the state of the Irish coinage.
As Treasurer and Council member of the King's Inns he was accused of being dilatory and inefficient, perhaps as a result of the "infirmity" referred to.
Ennoblement.
He was created 1st Baron Barry of Santry, County Dublin on 18 February 1661. His residence was at Santry. His portrait is the oldest now in the possession of the King's Inns.
Death.
He died on 9 February 1673 and was buried on 14 February 1673 in St. Mary's Chapel, Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin.

Old Bend High School

The Old Bend High School is a historic school building in Bend, Oregon, in the United States. Opened in 1925, the building served as a public high school for 31 years and a junior high school for an additional 22 years before being transitioned in 1979 into its current role as the administrative headquarters for the Bend-La Pine School District.
Because of its unique architecture and history, the Old Bend High School is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
Bend's first schoolhouse was opened in 1887. It was located in an abandoned cabin near the Deschutes River in what is now Drake Park. That schoolhouse was replaced in 1904 by a three-story wood-frame school building located at the north end of Bend's downtown area, near where the Deschutes County Court House is located today. The first high school curriculum was developed that same year, by Ruth Reid, who was the Bend School District’s first principal.
In 1913, the people of Bend passed a school bond issue that provided $23,000 for the purchase of property and the construction of a modern public school. The result was the three-story Reid School finished in 1914. The new school accommodated 241 students from first grade through high school. Because the Great Northern and Union Pacific railroads had opened routes into Central Oregon in 1911, the community was growing rapidly. As a result, 42 of the 241 children who attended the Reid School in 1914 were new students. 
In 1917, a new eight-room brick high school was built in downtown Bend. In its first year, the high school enrollment was 115 students. As the number of students continued to grow, the classrooms became overcrowded. By 1920, the high school had overflowed into sixteen temporary classrooms located in several downtown buildings including two cellars.
In 1923, the Bend school board established a building committee to develop plans for a new high school. Based on recommendations from the building committee, the school board accept the Bend Amateur Athletic Club building (also listed on the National Register of Historic Places) from the Bend Holding Company to use as the high school gymnasium. In January 1924, a new unified high school district was approved by Bend voters. A month later, voters in the unified school district approved a $209,000 bond issue for the construction of a new high school building adjacent to the Bend Amateur Athletic Club facility. Construction began in the fall of 1924, and was finished in time to open on 7 September 1925. There were 69 seniors in the school’s first graduating class in May 1926.
By 1952, the enrollment was approaching 1,000. However, the building continued to house Bend’s high school until 1956 when a new high school was opened. A year later, the old high school building became Cascade Junior High. It served as a junior high school for 22 years. In 1979, the junior high students moved to a new building, and the old facility was converted into administrative offices for the Bend-La Pine School District. Since 1979, the old Bend High School building has housed school district offices plus several kindergarten classrooms. 
Because of the school's unique architecture and its importance to the history of Bend, the Bend High School building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Today, a historic marker near the building’s main entrance reminds visitor of the school’s heritage.
Structure.
The old Bend High School is a neoclassical Beaux Arts style building designed by Hugh A. Thompson, Bend's first resident architect. Ed Brosterhous was the general contractor who supervised the school's construction. It was built at the south end of a parcel in downtown Bend. The site is bordered by Wall Street on the northwest, Louisiana Avenue on the northeast, Bond Street on the southeast, and the Bend Amateur Athletic Club property on the southwest. The main entrance faces Louisiana Avenue, with concrete walkways leading across the front lawn to the school’s main entrance. There are a number of large Ponderosa pine trees that shade the grounds. Play ground equipment for the children attending kindergarten in the building, give the area a park-like atmosphere. 
The old high school is a two-story structure with a high basement. The building has a U-shaped footprint measuring by . The walls are brick, built over a foundation course of stone masonry above a concrete basement. The front facade is well balanced with high windows from end to end and a wide stairway leading to the main portico entrance on the first floor. The main entrance is dominated by three round-head archways supported by wide brick columns resting on a cut stone foundation. The main wall of the building behind the portico is embellished with sculptured cut-stone and Doric-style stone caps.
The building has four other entrances, one on the east and west sides and two on the building's south side. The east and west sides match the building’s front façade with brick parapet walls and two stories of high windows plus a row of smaller window along the foundation to allow light into the basement rooms. The back side of the building has much less stone work and very little architectural decoration. However, the high windows continue around the entire building.

Blackbird Raum

Blackbird Raum is a folk punk band from Santa Cruz, California, formed in 2004. They are well known for their frantic live shows and anarchist politics. They have toured Europe, the Continental US and Alaska.
2004-2007: Formation and Demos.
Blackbird Raum was formed in 2004 by banjoist C.P.N and accordionist Zack while wilderness squatting in Santa Cruz, Ca. The band was haphazard at first, playing gigs and busking with a band randomly composed of other squatters living in an around Santa Cruz. Initially the band was not a success, and they made their first dollar from a man on a date who paid them to leave. During this period, they wrote some of the songs that are considered their classic material, including "Honey in the Hair" and "Coal". They also recorded a demo. After some frustrations with chaotic nature of the lineup, C.P.N left Santa Cruz for a year to play in other projects, when he returned he and Zack agreed to try the band again and a lineup was cemented with the addition of K.C. on washboard, David on washtub bass and Mars on musical saw and mandolin. They quickly wrote new material and recorded what was to be their first album: Purse-Seine, named after the poem by Robinson Jeffers.
2007-2010: Swidden.
The band were very unsatisfied with Purse-Seine and sought to quickly correct their mistakes. The result was a new album, Swidden. They went through a period of heavy touring, doing a full U.S. tour along with several others. Two years later they followed up with Under the Starling Host. During the release of UTSH, the band members set up a small collectively run anarchist record label called Black Powder to support other radical folk projects, including the Hail Seizures. After the release of UTSH the band took a hiatus for a few years, playing few gigs. After the 2011 release of the Hail Seizures/Blackbird Raum split 7" K.C. left the band.
2012-Present: False Weavers.
In 2012 Blackbird Raum regrouped, replacing K.C. on washboard with Allen Degenerate and signing to Silver Sprocket Bicycle Club for the release of False Weavers. Recorded at John Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone studio, the album marked a change in sound, with psychedelic touches the band has attributed to their love of Chumbawamba and Crass. Five months of touring in the US and Europe followed.
Lyrical and ideological influences.
Blackbird raum's lyrics tend to paint a bleak picture of modern society, focusing on issues like the destruction of the environment, mental Illness, and class warfare. They have described themselves as eco-anarchists.
In an interview with the The Sunday Times of Malta, banjo player C.P.N. had this to say about their political views:
The lyrics and song names often contain references to historical events, ancient myths and cultural icons:
Blackbird Raum makes use of epigraphs from many poets and writers. Among them are William Blake, George R. Stewart, Sir Thomas Mallory, Gary Snyder, Kenneth Rexroth and Black Elk.

Surtshellir

Surtshellir is a lava cave located in western Iceland, around 60 km from the settlement of Borgarnes. Approximately a mile in length, it is the longest such cave in the country. While mentioned in the medieval historical-geographical work "Landnámabók", Eggert Ólafsson was the first to give a thorough documentation of the cave in his 1750 travels of the region. It is named after the fire giant Surtr, a prominent figure in Norse mythology, who is prophesied to one day engulf the world in the fire of his flaming sword.
Being of volcanic origin, the walls of the interior are composed of vitrified layers of magma and basalt. The roof of the cave is about 10 metres high at the highest point, and the tunnels are around 15m broad at their greatest width. The floor is covered in a perpetual sheeting of ice and fallen fragments of solidified lava, and large ice speleothems are common within the cave. The height of the roof is highly variable throughout the cave, and at the latter extremities is only 2–4 m.
In the 10th century, the cave and the passages that lead out from the main cavern were used as hideouts for outcasts and bandits who would steal livestock from the farmers and shepherds living in the area. Evidence of their existence has been found in the form of the bones of sheep and oxen eaten for food in several of the tunnels; one of the same tunnels had also been fitted with a human-made door.
The cave itself has long been a source of superstition for the Icelanders inhabiting the nearby mountains. Eggert Ólafsson recalled having been warned by locals of the ghosts that were said to dwell within and was assured that his party would be killed by them if they were to enter. Surtr himself was said to have once lived within the cave and, being a fire giant, to have been the cause of the cave's creation.
Surtshellir is in close proximity to another lava cave, Stefánshellir, with which it forms a complex referred to as the Surtshellir-Stefánshellir system.

<doc id="21429479" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21429479" title="Arsenic toxicity">
Arsenic toxicity

Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons. Arsenic disrupts ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system organ failure (see arsenic poisoning) probably from necrotic cell death, not apoptosis. A post mortem reveals brick red colored mucosa, due to severe hemorrhage. Although arsenic causes toxicity, it can also play a protective role.
Exposure.
The oxides of arsenic are the most common threat since arsenite and arsenate salts are the most toxic. These forms are components of geologic formations and are extracted into the ground water. Thus although arsenic poisoning can be related to human activities such as mining and ore smelting, the most serious problems are natural, resulting from water wells drilled into aquifers that have high concentrations of arsenic. "Inorganic arsenic" (arsenate and arsenite salts) are more harmful than organic arsenic exposure.
Organic arsenic is 500 times less harmful than inorganic arsenic, and is a minor problem compared to the groundwater situation which affects many millions of people. Seafood is a common source of the less toxic organic arsenic in the form of arsenobetaine. The arsenic reported in 2012 in fruit juice and rice by "Consumer Reports" was primarily inorganic arsenic. Persistent ingestion of arsenic is linked with a broad variety of neurologic, cardiovascular, dermatologic, and carcinogenic effects; including peripheral neuropathy, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, melanosis, keratosis, and impairment of liver function.
Kinetics.
The two forms of inorganic arsenic, reduced (trivalent As (III)) and oxidized (pentavalent As(V)), can be absorbed, and accumulated in tissues and body fluids. In the liver, the metabolism of arsenic involves enzymatic and non-enzymatic methylation, the most frequently excreted metabolite (≥ 90%) in the urine of mammals is dimethylarsinic acid(or Cacodylic acid) (DMA(V)). Dimethylarsenic acid is also known as Agent Blue and was used as herbicide in the American war in the South-East Asian country of Viet Nam.
In humans inorganic arsenic is reduced nonenzymatically from pentoxide to trioxide, using glutathione (GSH) or it is mediated by enzymes. Reduction of arsenic pentoxide to arsenic trioxide increases its toxicity and bio availability, Methylation occurs through methyltransferase enzymes. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) may serve as methyl donor. Various pathways are used, the principal route being dependent on the current environment of the cell. Resulting metabolites are monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)) and dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)).
Methylation had been regarded as a detoxification process, but reduction from +5 As to +3 As may be considered as a bioactivation instead. Another suggestion is that methylation might be a detoxification if "As intermediates are not permitted to accumulate" because the pentavalent organoarsenics have a lower affinity to thiol groups than inorganic pentavalent arsenics. Gebel (2002) stated that methylation is a detoxification through accelerated excretion. With regard to carcinogenicity it has been suggested that methylation should be regarded as a toxification.
Arsenic, especially +3 As, binds to single, but with higher affinity to vicinal sulfhydryl groups, thus reacts with a variety of proteins and inhibits their activity. It was also proposed that binding of arsenite at nonessential sites might contribute to detoxification. Arsenite inhibits members of the disulfide oxidoreductase family like glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase.
The remaining unbound arsenic (≤ 10%) accumulates in cells, which over time may lead to skin, bladder, kidney, liver, lung, and prostate cancers. Other forms of arsenic toxicity in humans have been observed in blood, bone marrow, cardiac, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, gonadal, kidney, liver, pancreatic, and skin tissues.
Mechanism.
Arsenite inhibits not only the formation of Acetyl-CoA but also the enzyme succinic dehydrogenase. Arsenate can replace phosphate in many reactions. It is able to form Glc-6-Arsenate in vitro; therefore it has been argued that hexokinase could be inhibited. (Eventually this may be a mechanism leading to muscle weakness in chronic arsenic poisoning.) In the glyceraldehyde-3-P-dehydrogenase reaction arsenate attacks the enzyme-bound thioester. The formed 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate is unstable and hydrolyzes spontaneously. Thus, ATP formation in Glycolysis is inhibited while bypassing the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction. (Moreover, the formation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes might be affected, followed by a higher oxygen affinity of hemoglobin and subsequently enhanced cyanosis) As shown by Gresser (1981), submitochondrial particles synthesize Adenosine-5’-diphosphate-arsenate from ADP and arsenate in presence of succinate. Thus, by a variety of mechanisms arsenate leads to an impairment of cell respiration and subsequently diminished ATP formation. This is consistent with observed ATP depletion of exposed cells and histopathological findings of mitochondrial and cell swelling, glycogen depletion in liver cells and fatty change in liver, heart and kidney.
Experiments demonstrated enhanced arterial thrombosis in a rat animal model, elevations of serotonin levels, thromboxane A and adhesion proteins in platelets, while human platelets showed similar responses. The effect on vascular endothelium may eventually be mediated by the arsenic-induced formation of nitric oxide.
It was demonstrated that +3 As concentrations substantially lower than concentrations required for inhibition of the lysosomal protease cathepsin L in B cell line TA3 were sufficient to trigger apoptosis in the same B cell line, while the latter could be a mechanism mediating immunosuppressive effects.
Carcinogenicity.
It is still a matter of debate whether DNA repair inhibition or alterations in the status of DNA methylation are responsible for the carcinogenic potential of As. As vicinal sulfhydryl groups are frequently found in DNA-binding proteins, transcription factors and DNA-repair proteins, interaction of arsenic with these molecules appears to be likely.
However, in vitro, most purified DNA repair enzymes are rather insensitive to arsenic, but in cell culture, As produces a dose-dependent decrease of DNA ligase activity. This might indicate that inhibition of DNA repair is an indirect effect due to changes in cellular redox levels or altered signal transduction and consequent gene expression. In spite of its carcinogenicity, the potential of arsenic to induce point mutations is weak. If administered with point mutagens it enhances the frequency of mutations in a synergistic way.
Its comutagenic effects may be explained by interference with base and nucleotide excision repair, eventually through interaction with zinc finger structures. DMA showed to effectuate DNA single stand breaks resulting from inhibition of repair enzymes at levels of 5 to 100 mM in human epithelial type II cells.
+3 MMA and +3 DMA were also shown to be directly genotoxic by effectuating scissions in supercoiled ΦX174 DNA. Increased arsenic exposure is associated with an increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and sister-chromatid exchanges. An explanation for chromosomal aberrations is the sensitivity of the protein tubulin and the mitotic spindle to arsenic. Histological observations confirm effects on cellular integrity, shape and locomotion.
+3 DMA is able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reaction with molecular oxygen. Resulting metabolites are the dimethylarsenic radical and the dimethylarsenic peroxyl radical.
Both +5 DMA and +3 DMA were shown to release iron from horse spleen as well as from human liver ferritin if ascorbic acid was administered simultaneously. Thus, formation of ROS can be promoted.
Moreover, arsenic could cause oxidative stress by depleting the cell’s antioxidants, especially the ones containing thiol groups. The accumulation of ROS like the cited above and hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxides causes aberrant gene expression at low concentrations and lesions of lipids, proteins and DNA in higher concentrations which eventually lead to cellular death.
In a rat animal model, urine levels of 8-hydroxy-2’-desoxyguanosine (as a biomarker of ROS DNA damage) were measured after treatment with DMA. In comparison to control levels, they turned out to be significantly increased. This theory is further supported by a cross-sectional study which found elevated mean serum lipid peroxides (LPO) in the As exposed individuals which correlated with blood levels of inorganic arsenic and methylated metabolites and inversely correlated with nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) levels in whole blood. Another study found an association of As levels in whole blood with the level of reactive oxidants in plasma and an inverse relationship with plasma antioxidants. A finding of the latter study indicates that methylation might in fact be a detoxification pathway with regard to oxidative stress: the results showed that the lower the As methylation capacity was, the lower the level of plasma antioxidant capacity. As reviewed by Kitchin (2001), the oxidative stress theory provides an explanation for the preferred tumor sites connected with arsenic exposure. Considering that a high partial pressure of oxygen is present in lungs and +3 DMA is excreted in gaseous state via the lungs this seems to be a plausible mechanism for special vulnerability. The fact that DMA is produced by methylation in the liver, excreted via the kidneys and latter on stored in the bladder accounts for the other tumor localizations.
Regarding DNA methylation, some studies suggest interaction of As with methyltransferases which leads to an inactivation of tumor suppressor genes through hypermethylation, others state that hypomethylation might occur due to a lack of SAM resulting in aberrant gene activation. An experiment by Zhong et al. (2001) with arsenite-exposed human lung A549, kidney UOK123, UOK109 and UOK121 cells isolated eight different DNA fragments by methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed PCR. It turned out that six of the fragments were hyper- and two of them were hypomethylated. Higher levels of DNA methltransferase mRNA and enzyme activity were found.
Kitchin (2001) proposed a model of altered growth factors which lead to cell proliferation and thus to carcinogenesis. From observations, it is known that chronic low-dose arsenic poisoning can lead to increased tolerance to its acute toxicity. MRP1-overexpressing lung tumor GLC4/Sb30 cells poorly accumulate arsenite and arsenate. This is mediated through MRP-1 dependent efflux. The efflux requires GSH, but no As-GSH complex formation.
Although many mechanisms have been proposed, no definite model can be given for the mechanisms of chronic arsenic poisoning. The prevailing events of toxicity and carcinogenicity might be quite tissue-specific. Current consensus on the mode of carcinogenesis is that it acts primarily as a tumor promoter. Its co-carcinogenicity has been demonstrated in several models. However, the finding of several studies that chronically arsenic-exposed Andean populations (as most extremely exposed to UV-light) do not develop skin cancer with chronic arsenic exposure, is puzzling.
Heat shock response.
Another aspect is the similarity of arsenic effects to the heat shock response. Short-term arsenic exposure has effects on signal transduction inducing heat shock proteins with masses of 27,60,70,72,90,110 kDa as well as metallotionein, ubiquitin, mitogen-activated kinases, extracellular regulated kinase [ERK, c-jun terminal kinases and p38.
Via JNK and p38 it activates c-fos, c-jun and egr-1 which are usually activated by growth factors and cytokines The effects are largely dependent on the dosing regime and may be as well inversed.
As shown by some experiments reviewed by Del Razo (2001), ROS induced by low levels of inorganic arsenic increase the transcription and the activity of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) and the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (maybe enhanced by elevated MAPK levels), which results in c-fos/c-jun activation, over-secretion of pro-inflammatory and growth promoting cytokines stimulating cell proliferation. Germolec et al. (1996) found an increased cytokine expression and cell proliferation in skin biopsies from individuals chronically exposed to arsenic-contaminated drinking water.
Increased AP-1 and NF-κB obviously also result in an up-regulation of mdm2 protein, which decreases p53 protein levels. Thus, taking into account p53’s function, a lack of it could cause a faster accumulation of mutations contributing to carcinogenesis. However, high levels of inorganic arsenic inhibit NF-κB activation and cell proliferation. An experiment of Hu et al. (2002) demonstrated increased binding activity of AP-1 and NF-κB after acute (24 h) exposure to +3 sodium arsenite, whereas long-term exposure (10–12 weeks) yielded the opposite result. The authors conclude that the former may be interpreted as a defense response while the latter could lead to carcinogenesis. As the contradicting findings and connected mechanistic hypotheses indicate, there is a difference in acute and chronic effects of arsenic on signal transduction which is not clearly understood yet.
Oxidative stress.
Studies have demonstrated that the oxidative stress generated by arsenic may disrupt the signal transduction pathways of the nuclear transcriptional factors PPAR’s, AP-1, and NF-κB, as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-α. The interference of oxidative stress with signal transduction pathways may affect physiological processes associated with cell growth, metabolic syndrome X, glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, and diabetes-2. Recent scientific evidence has elucidated the physiological roles of the PPAR’s in the ω- hydroxylation of fatty acids and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-κB and AP-1), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, -6, -8, -12, and TNF-α), cell4 adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase, proinflammatory nitric oxide (NO), and anti-apoptotic factors.
Epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between chronic consumption of drinking water contaminated with arsenic and the incidence of Type 2-diabetes. The human liver after exposure to therapeutic drugs may exhibit hepatic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. However, the literature provides insufficient scientific evidence to show cause and effect between arsenic and the onset of diabetes mellitus Type 2.

Taylor's Chapel

Taylor's Chapel is a historic chapel located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is a Greek Revival style chapel located in a quarter acre fenced-in plot, which also includes a graveyard, within Mount Pleasant Park in northeast Baltimore. The structure is a small, mid-19th-century country church, built of stone, covered with stucco, painted white, and has a gable roof. The interior features frescoes on the walls and ceiling, attributed by tradition to the Italian-American painter Constantino Brumidi. The frescoes are "trompe l’oeil" paintings of classical architectural detailing, including pilasters, panels, coffering, and ornaments. It has remained completely unaltered since its construction in 1853. It was built as a Methodist chapel by the Taylor family on their Mt. Pleasant plantation. In 1925 the City of Baltimore purchased the chapel and burial ground, but the site has remained under the direction of a Board of Trustees from St. John's Methodist Church of Hamilton.
Taylor's Chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The latest major version, 2.0.0, was released in April 2012 and includes many substantial improvements over 1.x.
Overview.
Adhearsion is an entirely independent framework, including application and code generators and a plugin system. Today Adhearsion works with the Asterisk telephony engine, as well as with Tropo's PRISM through the open source Rayo protocol and requires Ruby 1.9.2 or higher.
The framework allows developers to create stand-alone voice applications, or add voice functionality to existing applications or systems using a modern dynamic programming language, Ruby, as opposed to requiring the use of VXML or CCXML. Adhearsion provides a set of classes and facilities that enables a developer to work with voice with little knowledge of the voice development domain.
Since both Adhearsion and all of its dependencies are open source, developers have the ability to develop sophisticated voice applications without significant up front costs that have been the historical norm in telephony development.
The current members that make up the core team are Jason Goecke, Ben Klang and Ben Langfeld.

Welcome to Hard Times (novel)

Welcome to Hard Times is the debut 1960 novel by American author E.L. Doctorow. It is about a small settlement in the Dakota Territory that is named Hard Times. After a reckless drifter comes into Hard Times and terrorizes the town with rape, murder and arson, the survivors lead an effort to rebuild. A major theme throughout the short novel is the relationship of the characters and evil, represented by their fear of the Bad Man from Bodie.
A review by the "New York Times" relates the book to Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness":
Perhaps the primary theme of the novel is that evil can only be resisted psychically: when the rational controls that order man's existence slacken, destruction comes. Conrad said it best in "Heart of Darkness," but Mr. Doctorow has said it impressively. His book is taut and dramatic, exciting and successfully symbolic.

Electrik Red

Electrik Red is a dance-pop girl group comprising Kyndra "Binkie" Reevey, Lesley Lewis, Naomi Allen and Sarah Rosete. The members began their individual careers as back-up dancers in New York City and Toronto. The group formed in 2005 and signed with Def Jam Recordings in 2008. Their music is mainly written and produced by songwriter The-Dream and his production partner Tricky Stewart.
Music career.
Electrik Red is made up of two sets of childhood friends, Reevey and Lewis from New York City and Allen and Rosete from Toronto. While working as back-up dancers for Usher in his 2004 "Confessions" tour, Reevey and Lewis asked Rosete if she wanted to be a part of their girl group. Rosete agreed to join, but requested that they meet her best friend, Allen, who they "fell in love with" and invited to join as well. The group moved to Los Angeles, where they began working with different producers, including Shannon "Slam" Lawrence and Rodney Jerkins. The quartet officially convened as Electrik Red in 2005. 
The four group members continued to work as professional dancers, individually appearing in videos for Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Akon, Ludacris, Chris Brown and in the film "Dreamgirls". After individually performing as dancers and models, they appeared together in Ciara's video for "Like a Boy". In late 2007, Allen and Rosete were cast in the video for The-Dream's single "Shawty Is a 10". Shakir Stewart, then the Executive Vice President of Def Jam Recordings, organized an audition for the group with label chairman L. A. Reid, and the group was signed to Def Jam on February 23, 2008. Shakir Stewart then organized a meeting for the group with The-Dream and Tricky Stewart, who cosigned Electrik Red to their Def Jam-affiliated label, Radio Killa. The-Dream and Tricky Stewart then became the group's executive producers for their debut album "", which was released on May 26, 2009. The group explained the album title as a "play on the stereotype of what a lady is supposed to be, how she is supposed to act and what she is supposed to say. We're bringing a new age woman to the world." The group wanted to show that it was "okay to be different". 
"How to Be a Lady: Volume 1" has spawned three singles, "Drink in My Cup", "So Good", and a remix of "So Good" featuring Lil Wayne. Music videos were filmed for "Drink in My Cup" and "Friend Lover," with both directed by Marc Klasfeld. Another video was shot with Lil Wayne for the "So Good" remix.
2010–2011.
As of early 2010, Electrik Red is recording their second album with guests and producers including Joi Starr, R. City (Pussycat Dolls), Midi Mafia (Fantasia) and others. The group premiered a new track at the E World Awards in Atlanta, GA on January 27, 2010 entitled, "I'm That Chick". On February 3, 2010 a 2-minute teaser sample of the track was released via YouTube and about a month later, the full track was released via the Twitter account of group member Lesley Lewis. On July 1, 2010 Binkie confirmed that the album would have a new sound, and that it would be the second part of the "How to Be a Lady" volumes.
2011–2012.
On January 22, 2011 Electrik Red announced an upcoming European tour via Twitter. On Valentine's Day February 14, 2011, Lesley premiered a one minute teaser sample "Bra's and Panties" via YouTube.
Later Lesley confirmed the label would not allow them to release "Bra & Panties".
The group then released "Africa (Put Cha Money On It)" which received positive reviews from fans.
Near the end of 2011 Electrik Red remade the song "That's My Bitch" by rappers Jay-Z & Kanye West.
2012 – present.
Since the debut of their first album, Electrik Red has been in the studio working on their second album which has an unknown release date.

Jay Rock

Johnny Reed McKinzie, Jr. (born March 31, 1986), better known by his stage name Jay Rock, is an American rapper from Watts, Los Angeles, California. Jay Rock grew up in Watts, known for its low income, gang, and drug infested streets. Rock ultimately chose to take rapping over street life after Anthony Tiffith, CEO of independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment, found Rock in 2005 and signed him to his label after hearing a verse of his. In 2007, Rock, alongside Top Dawg, secured a recording contract with Warner Bros. and later Asylum Records, but after both mergers fell through, the label linked up with Strange Music, after Tech N9ne, Missouri-based rapper and founder of the label, met with them and offered Rock a record deal.
Since 2006, Rock has released several mixtapes and is perhaps best known for his 2008 commercial debut single "All My Life (In the Ghetto)", which features Lil Wayne and will.i.am. Rock is also known for being a member of hip hop supergroup Black Hippy, alongside his label-mates and fellow West Coast rappers Kendrick Lamar, Schoolboy Q and Ab-Soul. In 2011, after signing his joint-venture deal with Strange Music, Rock's often-delayed and long-awaited debut studio album "Follow Me Home", was released. The album included "All My Life (In the Ghetto)", and a second single titled "Hood Gone Love It", featuring his Black Hippy cohort Kendrick Lamar.

Rock's mixtape "Tales From the Hood 2" went to iTunes on March 28, 2010 and his mixtape "From the Hood to the Cover of XXL" was released to iTunes on July 24, 2010. He also toured with 50 Cent, and other rappers on "The Invitation Tour". Around the same time he left Warner Bros. due to them delaying his album. Jay Rock then signed with indie record label Strange Music in the Fall of 2010, on a multi-album deal after leaving from Warner Bros. Jay Rock then went on tour with Tech N9ne, E-40, Glasses Malone, Kutt Calhoun and Kendrick Lamar on the "Independent Grind National Tour".

2012-present: Second studio album.
During 2012, Rock also toured with the rest of Black Hippy and Stalley, on BET's Music Matters Tour.

He was featured on the song "Money Trees", for which his verse was highly acclaimed. He also performed "Money Trees" with Lamar at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards, along with appearing in the TDE Cypher.

Dibble Iceberg Tongue

Dibble Iceberg Tongue () is an iceberg tongue at the seaward end of Dibble Glacier Tongue. The names Dibble Glacier and Dibble Glacier Tongue were applied by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in 1955, concurrent with G.D. Blodgett's delineation of the features from aerial photographs taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946–47). The offshore segment of these two related features was photographed by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions in 1956 and 1959, and the Antarctic Names Committee of Australia subsequently recommended that it be named Dibble Iceberg Tongue. US-ACAN has approved the latter name only for the portion lying seaward of Dibble Glacier Tongue.

Chiawana's campus features its own athletic facilities, which include a lighted football/soccer field surfaced with FieldTurf, negating the need to use Edgar Brown Memorial Stadium on the other end of town. The school's gymnasium was used by both Chiawana and Pasco High School for the 2009–10 school year, as the main gymnasium at Pasco High had an unanticipated roof replacement.
Athletics.
Chiawana competes in athletics in WIAA Class 4A in Yakima Valley District V, and are members of the Mid-Columbia Conference.
On December 7th, 2013, Chiawana won their first state football title in school history. Led by former Pasco High School football coach Steve Graff, the Riverhawks defeated the Camas Papermakers at the Tacoma Dome 27-26 in an amazing comeback victory. Chiawana, down 13 points with just under one minute remaining in the 4th quarter, scored 14 points in 55 seconds to secure the state title.

Boggsville, Colorado

Boggsville is a former settlement in Bent County, Colorado, USA near the Purgatoire River about above the Purgatoire's confluence with the Arkansas River. It was established in 1866. The surviving structures are among the earliest examples of Territorial architecture in Colorado. Boggsville was the last home of frontiersman Kit Carson before his death in 1868 at Fort Lyon. The U.S. Post Office at Las Animas (ZIP Code 81054) now serves Boggsville postal addresses.
Boggville lies along Highway 101 about 2 miles south of Las Animas.
History.
The village was a stagecoach station on the Purgatory Branch of the Santa Fe Trail. With the establishment of Bent County in 1870 Boggsville became the county seat. The town was named for Thomas O. Boggs (b. 1824, an Indian trader from the Indian Territory and cattle dealer. In 1846 Boggs married 14-year-old Rumalda Luna Bent, the stepdaughter of Charles Bent, first American governor of New Mexico, who was an heiress to land grants in Colorado. In 1866 Boggs built an adobe house on the grant. The next year John Wesley Prowers built a two-story 14-room house at Boggsville that functioned as a house, a school, a stagecoach station and after 1870 as the Bent County seat.
In 1867 the citizens of Boggsville dug the Tarbox Ditch from the Purgatoire to about of irrigated land. The ditch was the first such irrigation project in southeastern Colorado.
In 1873 the county seat was relocated to Las Animas City. At that time Boggsville had 97 voting citizens. The same year, the town was bypassed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the Kansas Pacific Railroad. Prowers moved to West Las Animas and became a cattle rancher and politician. Boggs, who was the first sheriff of Bent County and who was elected to the territorial legislature in 1871, moved to Springer, New Mexico in 1877 after his wife's land grants were contested. After the departure of Prowers and Boggs the property was sold, becoming the San Patricio Ranch of under the Lee family.
Description.
The Boggsville site is at the center of a large farm, of which were donated to the Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County containing the Boggs and Prowers houses, which are the only remaining historic structures. There had been at one time thirteen permanent buildings in the village, one of which was the home of Kit Carson from December 1867 until Carson's death in May 1868. The Carson House was destroyed in a 1921 flood.
The Boggs House has been unoccupied since 1975. It is U-shaped, but was originally L-shaped. The one story adobe structure combines features of Territorial architecture and Greek Revival characteristics. The Prowers House was last inhabited in the 1950s The rectangular house was partly collapsed by the 1980s, with portions removed as early as the 1920s. The Powers House is adobe, with interior woodwork brought to the site from St. Louis. There are a further five outbuildings associated with the Boggs House.
The Boggs and Prowers houses have been restored by the Pioneer Historical Society of Bent County, and the site is open to the public. Boggsville was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 24, 1986.

Background.
China Beijing Equity Exchange was established in 1994 and now conducts more than 50% of equity transfer, M&A and reconstruction operations in China. CBEX is the sole institution for the transfer of ownership of state-owned enterprises, selected by the Beijing Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and also one of the first trial equity transaction institutions authorized by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) for the transfer of ownership of state-owned enterprises owned by the Central Government. This implies that the largest and most profitable Chinese State-owned companies must necessarily be privatized through CBEX or one the remaining two Equity Exchanges authorised to this purpose. It is the first choice of distributing center for state equity transfer information in China, and owns plenty of resources on transfer of state-owned equities. The Investment and Financing Promotion Center of Zhongguancun Science & Technology Park, jointly established by CBEX and the Zhongguancun Science & Technology Park Administration is an important platform for investment and financing of high-tech enterprises in the Zhongguancun Science & Technology Park, and has accumulated a large number of investment and financing projects of high-tech enterprises. The Financing Asset Supermarket, jointly established by CBEX together with China Huarong Asset Management Corporation, China Orient Asset Management Corporation, China Cinda Asset Management Corporation and China Great Wall Asset Management Corporation, has collected financing assets. Meanwhile, CBEX has established co-operative relationships with equity exchange institutes in 24 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities through the establishment of agencies, forming a nationwide-wide service network for equity exchanges which can disseminate information on equity exchange projects all over the country.
Quite differently from any other Equity Exchange in China, CBEX has developed a unique cross-border expertise and has carried out a large number of deals with foreign investors. CBEX has entered into co-operation agreements with Nasdaq, the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Zurich Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Reuters and Sunbelt.
Mission.
CBEX completed 4,151 transactions in 2008 for a combined value in excess of 10 billion Euros. 
CBEX is operative in Italy through the equity exchange platform CMEX (China Milan Equity Exchange).

Alexander Saroukhan

Alexander Saroukhan (, ; born October 1, 1898 in Russia died in Cairo, Egypt in 1977) was an Egyptian-Armenian cartoonist / caricaturist whose drawings have appeared in a number of Arabic and international newspapers and magazines. He is considered one of the best and most famous caricaturists in the Arab world.
Early life.
In 1908 at age ten, he moved to Turkey where he studied languages. With his brother Levon Saroukhan, he published a weekly magazine. Later on Saroukhan worked as a translator of the Russian, Turkish and English languages in the British army. At the same time, his caricatures were published in Armenian newspapers and magazines, and notably in the satiric paper "Javroush". 
In 1922 he left Turkey to Europe and studied at the Brussel's Graphic Art Academy where he excelled and finished his studies in 2 years instead of the usual 4.
Career.
In 1924, Saroukhan left for Egypt with more than 125 pieces of his art work. His drawings were published in a satiric magazine called "Armenian Cinema".
Saroukhan presented some of his works at an exhibition in Cairo and then in Alexandria in Egypt. Through these exhibition, he met an Egyptian journalist Mohamed El-Tabii. Cooperating with each other, the two became the most important and influential journalists in Egypt for 20 years. Saroukhan worked as a caricaturist for the widely circulated "Rose el-Yusuf" paper where El-Tabii was editor. Saroukhan's first drawing that appeared on the cover of the magazine was that of Rose el-Yusuf in March 1928. From then on, Saroukhan became known as a ‘political' caricaturist.
His fame was also established through his character "El Masri Efendi" (meaning Egyptian Efendi, المصري أقندي in Arabic). However, because of a dispute between Rose (aka Fatima) el-Yusuf and Mohamad el-Tabii, Saroukhan left the magazine and joined the staff of another Egyptian well-known paper called "Akher Sa'a" (Last Hour) which el-Tabii published until 1946.
When Mohamed El-Tabii sold "Akher Saa" to "Akhbar El Yom" (Today's News in Arabic), Saroukhan moved to the new newspaper and worked for it until his death in 1977.
He established an Egyptian French-language humour magazine "La Caravane" in 1942 until its closing in 1945. He also contributed to Egypt's foreign language press, with cartoons in "La Presse Egyptienne", "Image" and Armenian daily Arev. He had many exhibitions in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Romania.
Publications.
Among Saroukhan's publications is "This War" in which he warned of the coming of World War Two. It is considered to be his finest book as it defined his talents to discover humor in criticism.
The Saroukhan style was prominent, independent and famous as he drew more than 20,000 different caricatures – political, social or humorous. Other publications include "The Political Year 1938", a collection of political caricatures, a book in Armenian on the art of caricature, five satirical plays in Armenian, "Our Seven Deadly Sins", and an article "How I Came to Egypt."
He also drew for republications of Armenian humorist Hagop Baronian classic "The Honorable Beggars" ("Medzabadiv Muratsganner" in Armenian) and Armenian humorist Yervant Odian classic "Comrade Panchoonie" ("Enger Pantchouni" in Armenian).

Sanggung

Sanggung was an official title of the senior 5th rank (正五品; "Jong 5 pum"), the highest attainable for "gungnyeo", a lady-in-waiting during the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. Female officers with the title were assigned to govern the inner affairs of the palace. When a regular nain served for more than 15 years, she would be awarded with an ornamental hairpin for a sanggung. Therefore, a newly appointed sanggung was usually 35–45 years old. A court lady at the rank of sanggung was treated well enough to live in her own house with servants.
The title first appears in Goryeosa ("History of Goryeo"), a complied book about the Goryeo period. In the chapter of the book titled "Baekgwanji" (百官志), regarding all official titles, there were posts named "sanggung" (尙宮, managing the palace), "sangchim" (尙寢, managing bedding), "sangsik" (尙食 managing food), and another "sangchim" (尙針, managing sewing) during the reign of King Hyeonjong. The book also has another record that Lady Han was appointed as "sanggung" in March 1031, the 22nd year of the king's reign. These records prove that the "sanggung" system had existed since the Goryeo period.
As a system on "naemyeongbu" (內命婦) which refers to women at court with a rank including queen and lady-in-waiting was revised since the foundation of the Joseon Dynasty, female officers with the title, "sanggung" began to manage inner affairs of the court in general as the highest position of the "gunggwan" (literally a palace officer). The "naemyeongbu" was largely divided into "naegwan" (literally "internal offices") and "gunggwan" according to "Gyeongguk daejeon". The former refers to a king's concubines or a crown prince's consort while "gunggwan" are female officers with a rank.
The social status of "sanggung" generally belonged to the "yangin" (common people) class, distinguished from "naegwan" in policy.

WAGR H class (diesel)

The H class are a class of diesel locomotives built by English Electric, Rocklea for the Western Australian Government Railways in 1964/65.
History.
To assist with the conversion of the 657 kilometre Eastern Goldfields Railway from Perth to Kalgoorlie to standard gauge, five locomotives were purchased from built English Electric. After being shipped by sea from Rocklea, they were hauled on narrow gauge to Upper Swan with the first entering service in January 1965.
After the completion of the gauge conversion project they began to haul local freight and infrastructure trains. In October 1992 one was scrapped with the other used as shunters at Forrestfield until withdrawn in 1996. All were sold in 1997 to SCT Logistics for use as shunters at Dynon, Islington and Kewdale.

Palatinate-Sulzbach

Palatinate-Sulzbach was the name of two separate states of the Holy Roman Empire located in modern Amberg-Sulzbach, Bavaria, Germany, ruled by a branch of the House of Wittelsbach.
Palatinate-Sulzbach (1569 - 1604).
Palatinate-Sulzbach was partitioned from Palatinate-Zweibrücken upon the death of Wolfgang, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken in 1569. His will provided that Palatinate-Sulzbach should be created out of Palatinate-Zweibrücken and ruled by his younger son Otto Henry. Otto Henry died in 1604 without any heirs so Palatinate-Sulzbach passed to Palatinate-Neuburg.
Palatinate-Sulzbach (1614 - 1742).
In 1614 Palatinate-Sulzbach was partitioned from Palatinate-Neuburg following the death of Count Palatine Philip Louis for his son Augustus. It consisted of two noncontiguous areas separated by the Electorate of Bavaria. It was bordered on the west by the territory of the Imperial city of Nuremberg and on the east by the Kingdom of Bohemia.
Augustus' successor Christian Augustus was a tolerant ruler who allowed his subjects to choose their religious denomination, introduced the simultaneum, allowed Jews to live in Sulzbach in 1666, and established an important printing industry. It became clear during the reigns of his successors that Palatinate-Sulzbach would inherit the Electorate of the Palatinate following the death of Charles III Philip, but this would only occur in 1742 for Charles Theodore.

1897 VFL finals series

The Victorian Football League's 1897 finals series determined the top four final positions of the 1897 VFL season. It began on the weekend of August 21, 1897 and ended on the weekend of September 3, 1897. Essendon were crowned the 1897 VFL premiers, finishing the finals series on top of the mini-ladder.
Finals system.
The VFL had several proposed finals systems leading up to the 1897 finals series. The system which was ultimately used was not decided until 17 August 1897, three days after the finals were scheduled to have begun under another system; the change was possible only because the first week of finals, scheduled for 14 August 1897, had been postponed due to inclement weather.
Ultimately, the clubs agreed to a system comprising a round-robin amongst the top four, with the provision for a play-off match for the premiership depending on the results of that round-robin. The finals system was as follows:
The takings for the first week of the finals were donated to charity; the remaining takings were divided amongst the league.
A point of contention was the venue for the finals matches; the venues were originally to be drawn by lot, but in early August, the league decided to fix the venues in advance, and in doing so did not schedule a final at Geelong's home ground of Corio Oval, which offered much lower gate takings than the four venues in Melbourne where the matches were scheduled (the MCG, Brunswick Street Oval, the Lake Oval and the East Melbourne Cricket Ground). This decision was later reversed after Geelong (who had won the minor premiership) lodged an official complaint with the league, and when the finals system was determined on August 17th, Geelong was scheduled to host its match in the first week.
Week One.
First Round Final (Collingwood vs Melbourne).
Collingwood narrowly defeated Melbourne in probably the finest game of the season. Collingwood's formed had vastly improved, although the Melbourne side was sadly depleted through injuries.
Week Two.
Second Round Final (Essendon vs Collingwood).
Essendon played brilliantly to account for Collingwood, kicking five goals five to three points in the final term. Essendon became the only unbeaten team after round two.
Second Round Final (Geelong vs Melbourne).
Geelong finished the stronger to down Melbourne; a goal by James near the end winning the game for them. The loss eliminated Melbourne from premiership contention.
Week Three.
Third Round Final (Essendon vs Melbourne).
Entering this game, Essendon could clinch the premiership with a victory, while Melbourne was already eliminated from premiership contention. In the low-scoring encounter, Melbourne hit the post three times and a goal by Essendon player Waugh was disallowed after the bell. Edgar Croft scored the only goal of the match after marking a skewed kick in the forward pocket.
Third Round Final (Geelong vs Collingwood).
Entering this game, it was known that if lost to in the other match (played at the same time), then the winner of this match would face in a playoff the following week to decide the premiership. Geelong's brilliant first-quarter burst meant Collingwood's chances of making it back into the match were near impossible. However in a thrilling match, Geelong ran out winners by less than a goal.

<doc id="21430607" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21430607" title="Giliap">
Giliap

Giliap is a 1975 Swedish drama film directed by Roy Andersson, starring Thommy Berggren as a man who takes a job as a waiter at a run-down hotel. It was a financial and critical failure, and it led to Andersson's not making another feature film for 25 years. Andersson has admitted that the film contains flaws, and he claims that the main reason for them was that he was not completely in control of the production, and therefore he had to compromise in several scenes. He has also suggested that the audience was not ready for the film, expecting it to be more similar to his previous film "A Swedish Love Story": "I think they didn't understand what I was doing. Later, when Kubrick came out with "Barry Lyndon", people accepted that - it's the same mood. But these things take time." The film is notable for its stylised settings, resembling what would later be seen in a more refined form in Andersson's "Songs from the Second Floor" and "You, the Living".
Plot.
A man arrives in a Swedish small town to work as a waiter at the run-down Hotel Busarewski (a play on the Swedish word "buse" - "crook"). He is installed in a small room, and soon begins to serve customers under the supervision of a strict, wheelchair-using manager suffering from an exaggerated self image.
The man befriends two co-workers: the talkative Gustav "The Count" Svensson and the beautiful waitress Anna. Anna says that she is only there working temporarily, just like the man himself, and that she will soon move on to work at a seaside hotel.
After work one day Anna takes the man to her borrowed apartment and tries to persuade him to go away with her somewhere. She tries to hug him but he is reluctant and returns to his room. There The Count visits him and reveals a plan he has that would bring them both lots of money. But in order to realize it they will first have to free a friend of The Count who happens to be in jail. The Count gives the man the code name "Giliap" to use during the operation.
Later Anna tries to have a talk with Giliap about feelings. She thinks he is mysterious, but Giliap claims that his secret is that he doesn't have any secrets. Anna says that she fears that he is going to take all her feelings and then just disappear.
The rescue operation for The Count's friend fails because of poor preparation and ends in confusion. After fleeing, The Count becomes seriously ill, and lying in his bed surrounded by colleagues he asks for Anna - who is at first reluctant but eventually appears, to The Count's satisfaction.
Later Giliap has bought a flower bouquet for Anna, but arriving at her apartment he is greeted by The Count who tells him she has left for that seaside hotel. Giliap goes there, finds her and embraces her. She starts to cry and they share dinner in a room she is sharing with another girl working at the same hotel.
The Count arrives at the seaside hotel and asks for whiskey. In the morning Anna once again tries to persuade Giliap to go away with her, before leaving for work. Outside she runs into The Count, who shows her lots of money, but she dismisses him. He then brings out a gun and shoots her.
Giliap and Anna's roommate walk out and find the money shattered all over the beach and start to collect it, before discovering Anna's body in the sand. Afterwards Anna's friends leaves on a train, leaving Giliap alone.
Reception.
The reviews were very negative with almost no exception, calling it pretentious, old fashioned and reactionary on the level of a high school student caught up in French films from the 30s. Sverker Andréason wrote in "Chaplin": "These people are evasively walking around each other, saying curious things of the type 'we are destruction people' and 'we live like migratory birds' and in the end I get the impression that Roy Andersson has got his whole philosophy of life from some film club that has gone through the dark French pre-war cinema with him, you know the one in which Jean Gabin always got shot right on the final step towards liberation."
After the initial reviews the film however gained some recognition, both in Sweden and abroad. In "Expressen" Lars Forssell, a member of the Swedish Academy, urged for everybody to go and see it, arguing that this film should be viewed the same way as a poem collection by Göran Sonnevi should be read, and further comparing the atmosphere to the poetry of Gustaf Fröding.
In popular culture.
In Killinggänget's 1996 comedy series Percy tårar one of the sketches involves an archetypical Swedish cinéaste, speaking unfavourably about Ingmar Bergman's "Fanny and Alexander" and claiming "Giliap" to be the only decent Swedish film from the last 25 years.

<doc id="21430675" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21430675" title="Gregorian mission">
Gregorian mission

The Gregorian mission (or Augustinian mission) was sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 596 AD to convert Britain's Anglo-Saxons. Headed by Augustine of Canterbury, by the death of the last missionary in 635 the mission had established Christianity in southern Britain. Along with the Irish and Frankish missions it converted other parts of Britain as well and influenced the Hiberno-Scottish missions to Continental Europe.
By the time the Roman Empire recalled its legions from the province of Britannia in 410, parts of the island had already been settled by pagan Germanic tribes who, later in the century, appear to have taken control of Kent and other coastal regions. In the late 6th century Pope Gregory sent a group of missionaries to Kent to convert Æthelberht, King of Kent, whose wife, Bertha of Kent, was a Frankish princess and practising Christian. Augustine was the prior of Gregory's own monastery in Rome and Gregory prepared the way for the mission by soliciting aid from the Frankish rulers along Augustine's route.
In 597 the forty missionaries arrived in Kent and were permitted by Æthelberht to preach freely in his capital of Canterbury. Soon the missionaries wrote to Gregory telling him of their success and that conversions were taking place. The exact date of Æthelberht's conversion is unknown but it occurred before 601. A second group of monks and clergy was dispatched in 601 bearing books and other items for the new foundation. Gregory intended Augustine to be the metropolitan archbishop of the southern part of the British Isles, and gave him power over the clergy of the native Britons, but in a series of meetings with Augustine the long-established Celtic bishops refused to acknowledge his authority.
Before Æthelberht's death in 616 a number of other bishoprics had been established but after that date, a pagan backlash set in and the see, or bishopric, of London was abandoned. Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburg, married Edwin, the king of the Northumbrians, and by 627 Paulinus, the bishop who accompanied her north, had converted Edwin and a number of other Northumbrians. When Edwin died, in about 633, his widow and Paulinus were forced to flee to Kent. Although the missionaries could not remain in all of the places they had evangelised, by the time the last of them died in 653, they had established Christianity in Kent and the surrounding countryside and contributed a Roman tradition to the practice of Christianity in Britain.
Background.
By the 4th century the Roman province of Britannia was converted to Christianity and had even produced its own heretic in Pelagius. Britain sent three bishops to the Synod of Arles in 314, and a Gaulish bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters. Lead baptismal basins and other artefacts bearing Christian symbols testify to a growing Christian presence at least until about 360.
After the Roman legions withdrew from Britannia in 410 the natives of Great Britain were left to defend themselves, and non-Christian Angles, Saxons, and Jutes—generally referred to collectively as Anglo-Saxons—settled the southern parts of the island. Though most of Britain remained Christian, isolation from Rome bred a number of distinct practices—Celtic Christianity—including emphasis on monasteries instead of bishoprics, differences in calculation of the date of Easter, and a modified clerical tonsure. Evidence for the continued existence of Christianity in eastern Britain at this time includes the survival of the cult of Saint Alban and the occurrence of "eccles"—from the Latin for "church"—in place names. There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxon newcomers.
The Anglo-Saxon invasions coincided with the disappearance of most remnants of Roman civilisation in the areas held by the Anglo-Saxons, including the economic and religious structures. Whether this was a result of the Angles themselves, as the early medieval writer Gildas argued, or mere coincidence is unclear. The archaeological evidence suggests much variation in the way that the tribes established themselves in Britain concurrently with the decline of urban Roman culture in Britain. The net effect was that when Augustine arrived in 597 the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms had little continuity with the preceding Roman civilisation. In the words of the historian John Blair, "Augustine of Canterbury began his mission with an almost clean slate."
Sources.
Most of the information available on the Gregorian mission comes from the medieval writer Bede, especially his "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum", or "Ecclesiastical History of the English People". For this work Bede solicited help and information from many people including his contemporary abbot at Canterbury as well as a future Archbishop of Canterbury, Nothhelm, who forwarded Bede copies of papal letters and documents from Rome. Other sources are biographies of Pope Gregory, including one written in Northern England around 700 as well as a 9th-century life by a Roman writer. The early "Life of Gregory" is generally believed to have been based on oral traditions brought to northern England from either Canterbury or Rome, and was completed at Whitby Abbey between 704 and 714. This view has been challenged by the historian Alan Thacker, who argues that the "Life" derives from earlier written works; Thacker suggests that much of the information it contains comes from a work written in Rome shortly after Gregory's death. Gregory's entry in the "Liber Pontificalis" is short and of little use, but he himself was a writer whose work sheds light on the mission. In addition, over 850 of Gregory's letters survive. A few later writings, such as letters from Boniface, an 8th-century Anglo-Saxon missionary, and royal letters to the papacy from the late 8th century, add additional detail. Some of these letters, however, are only preserved in Bede's work.
Bede represented the native British church as wicked and sinful. In order to explain why Britain was conquered by the Anglo-Saxons, he drew on the polemic of Gildas and developed it further in his own works. Although he found some native British clergy worthy of praise he nevertheless condemned them for their failure to convert the invaders and for their resistance to Roman ecclesiastical authority. This bias may have resulted in his understating British missionary activity. Bede was from the north of England, and this may have led to a bias towards events near his own lands. Bede was writing over a hundred years after the events he was recording with little contemporary information on the actual conversion efforts. Nor did Bede completely divorce his account of the missionaries from his own early 8th-century concerns.
Although a few hagiographies, or saints' biographies, about native British saints survive from the period of the mission, none describes native Christians as active missionaries amongst the Anglo-Saxons. Most of the information about the British church at this time is concerned with the western regions of the island of Great Britain and does not deal with the Gregorian missionaries. Other sources of information include Bede's chronologies, the set of laws issued by Æthelberht in Kent, and the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", which was compiled in the late 9th century.
Gregory the Great and his motivations.
Immediate background.
In 595, when Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission to the Anglo-Saxons, the Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Æthelberht. He had married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588, and perhaps earlier than 560. Bertha was the daughter of Charibert I, one of the Merovingian kings of the Franks. As one of the conditions of her marriage she had brought a bishop named Liudhard with her to Kent as her chaplain. They restored a church in Canterbury that dated to Roman times, possibly the present-day St Martin's Church. Æthelberht was at that time a pagan but he allowed his wife freedom of worship. Liudhard does not appear to have made many converts among the Anglo-Saxons, and if not for the discovery of a gold coin, the Liudhard medalet, bearing the inscription "Leudardus Eps" ("Eps" is an abbreviation of "Episcopus", the Latin word for bishop) his existence may have been doubted. One of Bertha's biographers states that, influenced by his wife, Æthelberht requested Pope Gregory to send missionaries. The historian Ian Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.
Motivations.
Most historians take the view that Gregory initiated the mission, although exactly why remains unclear. A famous story recorded by Bede, an 8th-century monk who wrote a history of the British Church, relates that Gregory saw fair-haired Anglo-Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people. Supposedly Gregory inquired about the identity of the slaves, and was told that they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels. The earliest version of this story is from an anonymous "Life of Gregory" written at Whitby Abbey about 705. Bede, as well as the Whitby "Life of Gregory", records that Gregory himself had attempted to go on a missionary journey to Britain before becoming pope. In 595 Gregory wrote to one of the papal estate managers in southern Gaul, asking that he buy English slave boys in order that they might be educated in monasteries. Some historians have seen this as a sign that Gregory was already planning the mission to Britain at that time, and that he intended to send the slaves as missionaries, although the letter is also open to other interpretations.
The historian N. J. Higham speculates that Gregory had originally intended to send the British slave boys as missionaries, until in 596 he received news that Liudhard had died, thus opening the way for more serious missionary activity. Higham argues that it was the lack of any bishop in Britain which allowed Gregory to send Augustine, with orders to be consecrated as a bishop if needed. Another consideration was that cooperation would be more easily obtained from the Frankish royal courts if they no longer had their own bishop and agent in place.
Higham theorises that Gregory believed that the end of the world was imminent, and that he was destined to be a major part of God's plan for the apocalypse. His belief was rooted in the idea that the world would go through six ages, and that he was living at the end of the sixth age, a notion that may have played a part in Gregory's decision to dispatch the mission. Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work together for the conversion of non-Christians within their territories. He urged the conversion of the heretical Arians in Italy and elsewhere, as well as the conversion of Jews. Also pagans in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica were the subject of letters to officials, urging their conversion.
Some scholars suggest that Gregory's main motivation was to increase the number of Christians; others wonder if more political matters such as extending the primacy of the papacy to additional provinces and the recruitment of new Christians looking to Rome for leadership were also involved. Such considerations may have also played a part, as influencing the emerging power of the Kentish Kingdom under Æthelberht could have had some bearing on the choice of location. Also, the mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards. At the time of the mission Britain was the only part of the former Roman Empire which remained in pagan hands and the historian Eric John argues that Gregory desired to bring the last remaining pagan area of the old empire back under Christian control.
Practical considerations.
The choice of Kent and Æthelberht was almost certainly dictated by a number of factors, including that Æthelberht had allowed his Christian wife to worship freely. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established,and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Another reason for the mission was the growing power of the Kentish kingdom. Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium, or overlordship, south of the River Humber. Lastly, the proximity of Kent to the Franks allowed for support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish Church and not merely as a spiritual adviser to the queen. Archaeological remains support the notion that there were cultural influences from Francia in England at that time.
Preparations.
In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, prior of Gregory's own monastery of St Andrew in Rome, to head the mission to Kent. Gregory selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish kings. The pope wrote to a number of Frankish bishops on Augustine's behalf, introducing the mission and asking that Augustine and his companions be made welcome. Copies of letters to some of these bishops survive in Rome. The pope wrote to King Theuderic II of Burgundy and to King Theudebert II of Austrasia, as well as their grandmother Brunhilda of Austrasia, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King Chlothar II of Neustria for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and were asked to allow some Frankish priests to accompany the mission. By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to ensure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which enjoyed the evident support of his wife's relatives and people. The Franks at that time were attempting to extend their influence in Kent, and assisting Augustine's mission furthered that goal. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.
Arrival and first efforts.
Composition and arrival.
The mission consisted of about forty missionaries, some of whom were monks. Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted by the nature of the task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return, which Gregory refused, and instead sending Augustine back with letters to encourage the missionaries to persevere. Another reason for the pause may have been the receipt of news of the death of King Childebert II, who had been expected to help the missionaries; Augustine may have returned to Rome to secure new instructions and letters of introduction, as well as to update Gregory on the new political situation in Gaul. Most likely, they halted in the Rhone valley. Gregory also took the opportunity to name Augustine as abbot of the mission. Augustine then returned to the rest of the missionaries, with new instructions, probably including orders to seek consecration as a bishop on the Continent if the conditions in Kent warranted it.
In 597 the mission landed in Kent, and it quickly achieved some initial success: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury, where they used the church of St. Martin's for services, and this church became the seat of the bishopric. Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion, but it probably took place in 597.
Process of conversion.
In the early medieval period, large-scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and large numbers of converts are recorded within a year of the mission's arrival in Kent. By 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism. A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler Thomas Elmham, gives the date of the king's conversion as Whit Sunday, or 2 June 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, but there is no other evidence for it. A letter of Gregory's to Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598 mentions the number of converts made, but does not mention any baptism of the king in 597, although it is clear that by 601 he had been converted. The royal baptism probably took place at Canterbury but Bede does not mention the location.
Why Æthelberht chose to convert to Christianity is uncertain. Bede suggests that the king converted strictly for religious reasons, but most modern historians see other motives behind Æthelberht's decision. Certainly, given Kent's close contacts with Gaul, it is possible that Æthelberht sought baptism in order to smooth his relations with the Merovingian kingdoms, or to align himself with one of the factions then contending in Gaul. Another consideration may have been that new methods of administration often followed conversion, whether directly from the newly introduced church or indirectly from other Christian kingdoms.
Evidence from Bede suggests that, although Æthelberht encouraged conversion, he could not compel his subjects to become Christians. The historian R. A. Markus feels that this was due to a strong pagan presence in the kingdom that forced the king to rely on indirect means including royal patronage and friendship to secure conversions. For Markus this is demonstrated by the way in which Bede describes the king's conversion efforts which, when a subject converted, were to "rejoice at their conversion" and to "hold believers in greater affection".
Instructions and missionaries from Rome.
After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success along with questions about the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum", this section of the "History" is usually known as the "Libellus responsionum". Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on some issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass. Other than the trip by Laurence, little is known of the activities of the missionaries in the period from their arrival until 601. Gregory mentions the mass conversions, and there is mention of Augustine working miracles that helped win converts, but there is little evidence of specific events.
According to Bede, further missionaries were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a pallium for Augustine, gifts of sacred vessels, vestments, relics, and books. The pallium was the symbol of metropolitan status, and signified that Augustine was in union with the Roman papacy. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain twelve suffragan bishops as soon as possible, and to send a bishop to York. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitan sees, one at York and one at London, with twelve suffragan bishops under each archbishop. Augustine was also instructed to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury, which never happened, perhaps because London was not part of Æthelberht's domain. Also, London remained a stronghold of paganism, as events after the death of Æthelberht revealed. London at that time was part of the Kingdom of Essex, which was ruled by Æthelberht's nephew Sæbert of Essex, who converted to Christianity in 604. The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after Æthelberht's death that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see, contradicting Bede's version of events. The choice of London as Gregory's proposed southern archbishopric was probably due to his understanding of how Britain was administered under the Romans, when London was the principal city of the province.
Along with the letter to Augustine, the returning missionaries brought a letter to Æthelberht that urged the king to act like the Roman Emperor Constantine I and force the conversion of his followers to Christianity. The king was also urged to destroy all pagan shrines. However, Gregory also wrote a letter to Mellitus, the "Epistola ad Mellitum" of July 601, in which the pope took a different tack in regards to pagan shrines, suggesting that they be cleansed of idols and converted to Christian use rather than destroyed; the pope compared the Anglo-Saxons to the ancient Israelites, a recurring theme in Gregory's writings. He also suggested that the Anglo-Saxons build small huts much like those built during the Jewish festival of Sukkot, to be used during the annual autumn slaughter festivals so as to gradually change the Anglo-Saxon pagan festivals into Christian ones.
The historian R. A. Markus suggests that the reason for the conflicting advice is that the letter to Æthelberht was written first, and sent off with the returning missionaries. Markus argues that the pope, after thinking further about the circumstances of the mission in Britain, then sent a follow-up letter, the "Epistolae ad Mellitum", to Mellitus, then "en route" to Canterbury, which contained new instructions. Markus sees this as a turning point in missionary history, in that forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view that the "Epistola" represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht has been challenged by George Demacopoulos who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the king in spiritual matters, while the "Epistola" was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other. Flora Spiegel, a writer on Anglo-Saxon literature, suggests that the theme of comparing the Anglo-Saxons to the Israelites was part of a conversion strategy involving gradual steps, including an explicitly proto-Jewish one between paganism and Christianity. Spiegel sees this as an extension of Gregory's view of Judaism as halfway between Christianity and paganism. Thus, Gregory felt that first the Anglo-Saxons must be brought up to the equivalent of Jewish practices, then after that stage was reached they could be brought completely up to Christian practices.
Church building.
Bede relates that after the mission's arrival in Kent and conversion of the king, they were allowed to restore and rebuild old Roman churches for their use. One such was Christ Church, Canterbury, which became Augustine's cathedral church. Archaeological evidence for other Roman churches having been rebuilt is slight, but the church of St Pancras in Canterbury has a Roman building at its core, although it is unclear whether that older building was a church during the Roman era. Another possible site is Lullingstone, in Kent, where a religious site dating to 300 was found underneath an abandoned church.
Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the monastery of Saints Peter and Paul, which later became St Augustine's Abbey, on land donated by the king. This foundation has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it Augustine introduced the Rule of St. Benedict into England, but there is no evidence that the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation.
Efforts in the south.
Relations with the British Christians.
Gregory had ordered that the native British bishops were to be governed by Augustine, and consequently Augustine arranged a meeting with some of the native clergy some time between 602 and 604. The meeting took place at a tree later given the name "Augustine's Oak", probably around the present-day boundary between Somerset and Gloucestershire. Augustine apparently argued that the British church should give up any of its customs not in accordance with Roman practices, including the dating of Easter. He also urged them to help with the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons.
After some discussion, the local bishops stated that they needed to consult with their own people before agreeing to Augustine's requests, and left the meeting. Bede relates that a group of native bishops consulted an old hermit who said they should obey Augustine if, when they next met with him, Augustine rose when he greeted the natives. But if Augustine failed to stand up when they arrived for the second meeting, they should not submit. When Augustine failed to rise to greet the second delegation of British bishops at the next meeting, Bede says the native bishops refused to submit to Augustine. Bede then has Augustine proclaim a prophecy that because of lack of missionary effort towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British church, the native church would suffer at the hands of the Anglo-Saxons. This prophecy was seen as fulfilled when Æthelfrith of Northumbria supposedly killed 1200 native monks at the Battle of Chester. Bede uses the story of Augustine's two meetings with two groups of British bishops as an example of how the native clergy refused to cooperate with the Gregorian mission. Later, Aldhelm, the abbot of Malmesbury, writing in the later part of the 7th century, claimed that the native clerks would not eat with the missionaries, nor would they perform Christian ceremonies with them. Laurence, Augustine's successor, writing to the Irish bishops during his tenure of Canterbury, also stated that an Irish bishop, Dagan, would not share meals with the missionaries.
One probable reason for the British clergy's refusal to cooperate with the Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands at the time of the mission. The British were unwilling to preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have been unwilling to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have been unwilling to do.
Most of the information on the Gregorian mission comes from Bede's narrative, and this reliance on one source necessarily leaves the picture of native missionary efforts skewed. First, Bede's information is mainly from the north and the east of Britain. The western areas, where the native clergy was strongest, was an area little covered by Bede's informants. In addition, although Bede presents the native church as one entity, in reality the native British were divided into a number of small political units, which makes Bede's generalisations suspect. The historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the "Libellus" points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism, but also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity. Besides the text of the "Libellus" contained within Bede's work, other versions of the letter circulated, some of which included a question omitted from Bede's version. Wood argues that the question, which dealt with the cult of a native Christian saint, is only understandable if this cult impacted Augustine's mission, which would imply that Augustine had more relations with the local Christians than those related by Bede.
Spread of bishoprics and church affairs.
In 604, another bishopric was founded, this time at Rochester, where Justus was consecrated as bishop. The king of Essex was converted in the same year, allowing another see to be established at London, with Mellitus as bishop. Rædwald, the king of the East Angles, also was converted, but no see was established in his territory. Rædwald had been converted while visiting Æthelberht in Kent, but when he returned to his own court he worshiped pagan gods as well as the Christian god. Bede relates that Rædwald's backsliding was because of his still-pagan wife, but the historian S. D. Church sees political implications of overlordship behind the vacillation about conversion. When Augustine died in 604, Laurence, another missionary, succeeded him as archbishop.
The historian N. J. Higham suggests that a synod, or ecclesiastical conference to discuss church affairs and rules, was held at London during the early years of the mission, possibly shortly after 603. Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon native who became a missionary to the continental Saxons, mentions such a synod being held at London. Boniface says that the synod legislated on marriage, which he discussed with Pope Gregory III in 742. Higham argues that because Augustine had asked for clarifications on the subject of marriage from Gregory the Great, it is likely that he could have held a synod to deliberate on the issue. Nicholas Brooks, another historian, is not so sure that there was such a synod, but does not completely rule out the possibility. He suggests it might have been that Boniface was influenced by a recent reading of Bede's work.
The rise of Æthelfrith of Northumbria in the north of Britain limited Æthelbertht's ability to expand his kingdom as well as limiting the spread of Christianity. Æthelfrith took over Deira about 604, adding it to his own realm of Bernicia. However, the Frankish kings in Gaul were increasingly involved in internal power struggles, leaving Æthelbertht free to continue to promote Christianity within his own lands. The Kentish Church sent Justus, then Bishop of Rochester, and Peter, the abbot of Sts Peter and Paul Abbey in Canterbury, to the Council of Paris in 614, probably with Æthelbertht's support. Æthelbertht also promulgated a code of laws, which was probably influenced by the missionaries.
Pagan reactions.
A pagan reaction set in following Æthelbert's death in 616; Mellitus was expelled from London never to return, and Justus was expelled from Rochester, although he eventually managed to return after spending some time with Mellitus in Gaul. Bede relates a story that Laurence was preparing to join Mellitus and Justus in Francia when he had a dream in which Saint Peter appeared and whipped Laurence as a rebuke for his plans to leave his mission. When Laurence woke whip marks had miraculously appeared on his body. He showed these to the new Kentish king, who promptly was converted and recalled the exiled bishops.
The historian N. J. Higham sees political factors at work in the expulsion of Mellitus, as it was Sæberht's sons who banished Mellitus. Bede said that the sons had never been converted, and after Æthelberht's death they attempted to force Mellitus to give them the Eucharist without ever becoming Christians, seeing the Eucharist as magical. Although Bede does not give details of any political factors surrounding the event, it is likely that by expelling Mellitus the sons were demonstrating their independence from Kent, and repudiating the overlordship that Æthelberht had exercised over the East Saxons. There is no evidence that Christians among the East Saxons were mistreated or oppressed after Mellitus' departure.
Æthelberht was succeeded in Kent by his son Eadbald. Bede states that after Æthelberht's death Eadbald refused to be baptised and married his stepmother, an act forbidden by the teachings of the Roman Church. Although Bede's account makes Laurence's miraculous flogging the trigger for Eadbald's baptism, this completely ignores the political and diplomatic problems facing Eadbald. There are also chronological problems with Bede's narrative, as surviving papal letters contradict Bede's account. Historians differ on the exact date of Eadbald's conversion. D. P. Kirby argues that papal letters imply that Eadbald was converted during the time that Justus was Archbishop of Canterbury, which was after Laurence's death, and long after the death of Æthelberht. Henry Mayr-Harting accepts the Bedan chronology as correct, and feels that Eadbald was baptised soon after his father's death. Higham agrees with Kirby that Eadbald did not convert immediately, contending that the king supported Christianity but did not convert for at least eight years after his father's death.
Spread of Christianity to Northumbria.
The spread of Christianity in the north of Britain gained ground when Edwin of Northumbria married Æthelburg, a daughter of Æthelbert, and agreed to allow her to continue to worship as a Christian. He also agreed to allow Paulinus of York to accompany her as a bishop, and for Paulinus to preach to the court. By 627, Paulinus had converted Edwin, and on Easter, 627, Edwin was baptised. Many others were baptised after the king's conversion. The exact date when Paulinus went north is unclear; some historians argue for 625, the traditional date, whereas others believe that it was closer to 619. Higham argues that the marriage alliance was part of an attempt by Eadbald, brother of the bride, to capitalise on the death of Rædwald in about 624, in an attempt to regain the overkingship his father had once enjoyed. According to Higham, Rædwald's death also removed one of the political factors keeping Eadbald from converting, and Higham dates Eadbald's baptism to the time that his sister was sent to Northumbria. Although Bede's account gives all the initiative to Edwin, it is likely that Eadbald also was active in seeking such an alliance. Edwin's position in the north also was helped by Rædwald's death, and Edwin seems to have held some authority over other kingdoms until his death.
Paulinus was active not only in Deira, which was Edwin's powerbase, but also in Bernicia and Lindsey. Edwin planned to set up a northern archbishopric at York, following Gregory the Great's plan for two archdioceses in Britain. Both Edwin and Eadbald sent to Rome to request a pallium for Paulinus, which was sent in July 634. Many of the East Angles, whose king, Eorpwald appears to have converted to Christianity, were also converted by the missionaries. Following Edwin's death in battle, in either 633 or 634, Paulinus returned to Kent with Edwin's widow and daughter. Only one member of Paulinus' group stayed behind, James the Deacon. After Justus' departure from Northumbria, a new king, Oswald, invited missionaries from the Irish monastery of Iona, who worked to convert the kingdom.
About the time that Edwin died in 633, a member of the East Anglian royal family, Sigeberht, returned to Britain after his conversion while in exile in Francia. He asked Honorius, one of the Gregorian missionaries who was then Archbishop of Canterbury, to send him a bishop, and Honorius sent Felix of Burgundy, who was already a consecrated bishop; Felix succeeded in converting the East Angles.
Other aspects.
The Gregorian missionaries focused their efforts in areas where Roman settlement had been concentrated. It is possible that Gregory, when he sent the missionaries, was attempting to restore a form of Roman civilisation to England, modelling the church's organisation after that of the church in Francia at that time. Another aspect of the mission was how little of it was based on monasticism. One monastery was established at Canterbury, which later became St Augustine's Abbey, but although Augustine and some of his missionaries had been monks, they do not appear to have lived as monks at Canterbury. Instead, they lived more as secular clergy serving a cathedral church, and it appears likely that the sees established at Rochester and London were organised along similar lines. The Gaulish and Italian churches were organised around cities and the territories controlled by those cities. Pastoral services were centralised, and churches were built in the larger villages of the cities' territorial rule. The seat of the bishopric was established in the city and all churches belonged to the diocese, staffed by the bishop's clergy.
Most modern historians have noted how the Gregorian missionaries come across in Bede's account as colourless and boring, compared to the Irish missionaries in Northumbria, and this is related directly to the way Bede gathered his information. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting argues that in addition, most of the Gregorian missionaries were concerned with the Roman virtue of "gravitas", or personal dignity not given to emotional displays, and this would have limited the colourful stories available about them.
One reason for the mission's success was that it worked by example. Also important was Gregory's flexibility and willingness to allow the missionaries to adjust their liturgies and behaviour. Another reason was the willingness of Æthelberht to be baptised by a non-Frank. The king would have been wary of allowing the Frankish bishop Liudhard to convert him, as that might open Kent up to Frankish claims of overlordship. But being converted by an agent of the distant Roman pontiff was not only safer, it allowed the added prestige of accepting baptism from the central source of the Latin Church. As the Roman Church was considered part of the Roman Empire in Constantinople, this also would gain Æthelberht acknowledgement from the emperor. Other historians have attributed the success of the mission to the substantial resources Gregory invested in its success; he sent over forty missionaries in the first group, with more joining them later, a quite significant number.
Legacy.
The last of Gregory's missionaries, Archbishop Honorius, died on 30 September 653. He was succeeded as archbishop by Deusdedit, a native Englishman.
Pagan practices.
The missionaries were forced to proceed slowly, and could not do much about eliminating pagan practices, or destroying temples or other sacred sites, unlike the missionary efforts that had taken place in Gaul under St Martin. There was little fighting or bloodshed during the mission. Paganism was still practised in Kent until the 630s, and it was not declared illegal until 640. Although Honorius sent Felix to the East Angles, it appears that most of the impetus for conversion came from the East Anglian king.
With the Gregorian missionaries, a third strand of Christian practice was added to the British Isles, to combine with the Gaulish and the Hiberno-British strands already present. Although it is often suggested that the Gregorian missionaries introduced the Rule of Saint Benedict into England, there is no supporting evidence. The early archbishops at Canterbury claimed supremacy over all the bishops in the British Isles, but their claim was not acknowledged by most of the rest of the bishops. The Gregorian missionaries appear to have played no part in the conversion of the West Saxons, who were converted by a missionary sent directly by Pope Honorius I. Neither did they have much lasting influence in Northumbria, where after Edwin's death the conversion of the Northumbrians was achieved by missionaries from Iona, not Canterbury.
Papal aspects.
An important by-product of the Gregorian mission was the close relationship it fostered between the Anglo-Saxon Church and the Roman Church. Although Gregory had intended for the southern archiepiscopal see to be located at London, that never happened. A later tradition, dating from 797, when an attempt was made to move the archbishopric from Canterbury to London by King Coenwulf of Mercia, stated that on the death of Augustine, the "wise men" of the Anglo-Saxons met and decided that the see should remain at Canterbury, for that was where Augustine had preached. The idea that an archbishop needed a pallium in order to exercise his archiepiscopal authority derives from the Gregorian mission, which established the custom at Canterbury from where it was spread to the Continent by later Anglo-Saxon missionaries such as Willibrord and Boniface. The close ties between the Anglo-Saxon church and Rome were strengthened later in the 7th century when Theodore of Tarsus was appointed to Canterbury by the papacy.
The mission was part of a movement by Gregory to turn away from the East, and look to the Western parts of the old Roman Empire. After Gregory, a number of his successors as pope continued in the same vein, and maintained papal support for the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. The missionary efforts of Augustine and his companions, along with those of the Hiberno-Scottish missionaries, were the model for the later Anglo-Saxon missionaries to Germany. The historian R. A. Markus suggests that the Gregorian mission was a turning point in papal missionary strategy, marking the beginnings of a policy of persuasion rather than coercion.
Cults of the saints.
Another effect of the mission was the promotion of the cult of Pope Gregory the Great by the Northumbrians amongst others; the first "Life" of Gregory is from Whitby Abbey in Northumbria. Gregory was not popular in Rome, and it was not until Bede's "Ecclesisastical History" began to circulate that Gregory's cult also took root there. Gregory, in Bede's work, is the driving force behind the Gregorian mission, and Augustine and the other missionaries are portrayed as depending on him for advice and help in their endeavours. Bede also gives a leading role in the conversion of Northumbria to Gregorian missionaries, especially in his "Chronica Maiora", in which no mention is made of any Irish missionaries. By putting Gregory at the centre of the mission, even though he did not take part in it, Bede helped to spread the cult of Gregory, who not only became one of the major saints in Anglo-Saxon England, but continued to overshadow Augustine even in the afterlife; an Anglo-Saxon church council of 747 ordered that Augustine should always be mentioned in the liturgy right after Gregory.
A number of the missionaries were considered saints, including Augustine, who became another cult figure; the monastery he founded in Canterbury was eventually rededicated to him. Honorius, James the Deacon, Justus, Lawrence, Mellitus, Paulinus, and Peter, were also considered saints, along with Æthelberht, of whom Bede said that he continued to protect his people even after death.
Art, architecture, and music.
A few objects at Canterbury have traditionally been linked with the mission, including the 6th-century St Augustine Gospels produced in Italy, now held at Cambridge as Corpus Christi College MS 286. There is a record of an illuminated and imported "Bible of St Gregory", now lost, at Canterbury in the 7th century. Thomas of Elmham, in the late 15th century, described a number of other books held at that time by St Augustine's Abbey, believed to have been gifts to the abbey from Augustine. In particular, Thomas recorded a psalter as being associated with Augustine, which the antiquary John Leland saw at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s, but it has since disappeared.
Augustine built a church at his foundation of Sts Peter and Paul Abbey at Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's Abbey. This church was destroyed after the Norman Conquest to make way for a new abbey church. The mission also established Augustine's cathedral at Canterbury, which became Christ Church Priory. This church has not survived, and it is unclear if the church that was destroyed in 1067 and described by the medieval writer Eadmer as Augustine's church, was built by Augustine. Another medieval chronicler, Florence of Worcester, claimed that the priory was destroyed in 1011, and Eadmer himself had contradictory stories about the events of 1011, in one place claiming that the church was destroyed by fire and in another claiming only that it was looted. A cathedral was also established in Rochester; although the building was destroyed in 676, the bishopric continued in existence. Other church buildings were erected by the missionaries in London, York, and possibly Lincoln, although none of them survive.
The missionaries introduced a musical form of chant into Britain, similar to that used in Rome during the mass. During the 7th and 8th centuries Canterbury was renowned for the excellence of its clergy's chanting, and sent singing masters to instruct others, including two to Wilfrid, who became Bishop of York. Putta, the first Bishop of Rochester, had a reputation for his skill at chanting, which he was said to have learned from the Gregorian missionaries. One of them, James the Deacon, taught chanting in Northumbria after Paulinus returned to Kent; Bede noted that James was accomplished in the singing of the chants.
Legal codes and documents.
The historian Ann Williams has argued that the missionaries' familiarity with the Roman law, recently codified by the Emperor Justinian in the "Corpus Iuris Civilis" promulgated in 534, were an influence on the English kings promulgating their own law codes. Bede specifically calls Æthelberht's code a "code of law after the Roman manner". Another influence, also introduced by the missionaries, on the early English law codes was the Old Testament legal codes. Williams sees the issuing of legal codes as not just laws but also as statements of royal authority, showing that the kings were not just warlords but also lawgivers and capable of securing peace and justice in their kingdoms. It has also been suggested that the missionaries contributed to the development of the charter in England, for the earliest surviving charters show not just Celtic and Frankish influences but also Roman touches. Williams argues that it is possible that Augustine introduced the charter into Kent.

Peel's Acts

Peel's Acts (as they are commonly known) were Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. They consolidated provisions from a large number of earlier statutes which were then repealed. Their purpose was to simplify the criminal law. The term refers to the Home Secretary who sponsored them, Sir Robert Peel. There were two separate sets of broadly identical Acts for England and Ireland respectively.
The Acts were the product of a failed attempt to codify the criminal law. They were replaced by the criminal law consolidation Acts 1861.
List.
The first four Acts on this list consolidated 316 Acts, representing almost four-fifths of all offences.
