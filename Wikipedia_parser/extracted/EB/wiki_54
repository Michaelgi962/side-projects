Black Gold Stakes

The Black Gold Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race run over a distance of six furlongs on the main track at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans, Louisiana.
Open to three-year-old Thoroughbred horses of either gender, it takes place in February of the year and offers a purse of $60,000.
The Black Gold Stakes is named for Black Gold who won the 1924 Louisiana Derby as well as that year's Kentucky Derby, one of only two horses ever to do so. Black Gold was buried in the Fairgrounds infield near Pan Zareta, one of the great racing mares. It is now a tradition for the winning jockey of the Black Gold to place a wreath of flowers on Black Gold's grave.

William Binnington Boyce

William Binnington Boyce (9 November 1804 – 8 March 1889) was an English-born philologist and clergyman, active in Australia.
Early life.
Boyce was born at Beverley, Yorkshire, England, is mother's family were Wesleyans. Boyce studied commerce at Kingston upon Hull. He entered the Wesleyan ministry and in 1830 was sent to Buntingvale, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa with instructions to compile a grammar of the Kaffir language. He did this while working as a missionary and published it in 1834 under the title of "A Grammar of the Kafir Language" (Spelt with one "f" in the first edition). A second edition, "A Grammar of the Kaffir Language" expanded and improved with "Vocabulary and Exercises" by William J. Davis, was published in 1844, and a third in 1863. Boyce was recalled to England in 1843, serving at a church at Bolton, Lancashire for two years.
Australia.
Boyce was then sent to Australia as general superintendent of the Wesleyan missions. He arrived at Sydney in January 1846, carried on his work vigorously, and was elected president of the first Wesleyan conference held in Australia. In August 1847 he edited and published the weekly "Gleaner". He published in 1849 "A Brief Grammar of Modern Geography, For the Use of Schools". In 1850 he was appointed one of the original sixteen members of the senate of the University of Sydney and took a special interest in the formation of the university library. Brusque at times, he had little time for 'unthinking parrots who repeat without understanding the dogmas and sayings of the popularities of the day'. In 1859 Boyce resigned and went to England to become one of the general secretaries of foreign missions. He edited in 1874 a "Memoir of the Rev. William Shaw", and in the same year appeared "Statistics of Protestant Missionary Societies, 1872-3".
Boyce returned to Sydney in 1871 and took up church work again. He was a busy man, often doing much lecturing during the week and preaching three times on a Sunday. He also found time to do considerable literary work and brought out two important books, "The Higher Criticism and the Bible" (1881), and an "Introduction to the Study of History" (1884).
Late life and legacy.
Early in 1885, at a dinner party in Sydney, he met J. A. Froude, who was much attracted to him ("Oceania", p. 195). Working until the end, with his mind in full vigour, Boyce died suddenly at Glebe, Sydney on 8 March 1889 and was buried in the Wesleyan section of Rookwood cemetery. He was married twice (1) to a daughter of James Bowden and (2) to a daughter of the Hon. George Allen and was survived by four daughters by the first marriage. He presented two thousand volumes from his own library to the Wesleyan Theological Institution at Stanmore.
Boyce's "Grammar of the Kaffir Language" had special value as it formed the basis on which much of the study of other South African languages was built. His volume on "The Higher Criticism and the Bible", and his "Introduction to the Study of History", were both excellent books of their period, and his organizing power was shown in his bringing the Wesleyan Church in Australia to the state when it could free itself from requiring help from the missionary society in England.
A grandson, William Ralph Boyce Gibson (1869-1935), was professor of mental and moral philosophy at the university of Melbourne from 1911 to 1934 and was the author of several philosophical works. He was succeeded by his son, Alexander Boyce Gibson, born in 1900. A distant relative, born in 1994, Adam D. Binnington is currently a lecturer of Spanish in the town of Scarborough.

Inughuit

The Inughuit (also spelled Inuhuit), historically Arctic Highlanders, are a Greenlandic Inuit people. Also known as Polar Eskimos, they are the northernmost group of Inuit, and the world's northernmost people, living in Greenland. They are 1% of the population of Greenland.
Language.
The Inughuit speak the Inuktun language, also known as North Greenlandic, Thule Inuit, or Polar Eskimo. It is a dialect of the Greenlandic Inuktitut language, an Eskimo-Aleut language, which is the national language of Greenland. 
In the official Greenlandic language, Inuktun is called Avanersuarmiutut.
Population.
Before 1880, their population was estimated to be between 100 and 200 people. From 1880 to 1930, they were estimated to number 250. In 1980, their estimated population was 700, and it rose to 800 in 2010.
European contact.
The Inughuit were first contacted by Europeans in 1818, when John Ross led an expedition into their territory. Ross dubbed them "Arctic Highlanders". 
In 1908 and 1909, the Inughuit were instrumental in assisting both Frederick Cook and Robert Peary on their claimed conquests of the North Pole. 
Dane Erik Holtved was the first university-trained ethnologist to study the Inughuit.
Settlements.
Inughuit people live north of the Arctic circle on the west coast of Greenland, between 75°—80° N and 58°–74° W. The northernmost settlement was at the village of Etah (at 78° 19' N), but it was abandoned due to the extremely harsh conditions there. The northernmost constant settlement is now Hiurapaluk.
Pituffik, also known as Dundas or Thule to Europeans, was the chief settlement of the Inughuit until 1953 when it was displaced by the United States' Thule Air Base, with its residents relocated to Qaanaaq. Established in 1953, Qaanaaq is the largest Inughuit settlement.
The Inughuit have brought a claim in Danish and international courts against the United States, which they won, but as the United States does not recognize these courts, there is little chance of compensation.

WZMJ

WZMJ is an variety adult hits radio station licensed to Batesburg, South Carolina and is located within the Columbia, South Carolina DMA. Lake Murray Communications, LLC is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 93.1 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 2.1 kW. 
History.
The station signed on the air on August 5, 1965 as WBLR-FM, the sister station to WBLR 1430 AM, located in Batesburg-Leesville. At the time, WBLR-FM was located on 92.1 FM and had featured a middle of the road (MOR) format.
In 1979, in order to accommodate a class/power increase for WTWE/Manning, WWBD/Bamberg was moved from 92.7 to 92.1, which required WBLR-FM to move from 92.1 to 95.3. As a result, WBLR-FM became WKWQ when it moved. 
In the beginning WKWQ had featured a country music format, but changed to album rock as "K-95 Rock" in 1986 and started to target nearby Columbia. However, it did not have an adequate signal to compete with the others stations in town. In 1988, the station changed again to urban contemporary as "Hot 95" in an attempt to compete with urban powerhouse WWDM, but failed. During this period, the tower was moved closer to Columbia, but the signal problems remained.
WKWQ moved from 95.3 to 93.1 in early 1991. The station was re-launched as K-93, but was still handicapped by a smaller signal as well as underfunded ownership. The station eventually went to satellite programming using Satellite Music Network's "The Touch" Adult Urban Contemporary format and was paired with sister station WKSO (now known as WHXT) located in Orangeburg.
This arrangement lasted until 1999 when WKWQ broke off from the simulcast with WKSO and flipped to Urban Oldies as "Majik 93.1", taking the new call letters of WZMJ. Unfortunately, Majic 93.1 never took off due to a weak signal as well as strong competition from Jammin' Oldies outlet WSCQ (now known as WVOC-FM), which launched a few months later. In 2000, the format was changed to Beach Music. 
The station, as well as sister urban contemporary outlet, WHXT was sold in 2003 to Inner City Broadcasting. 
Shortly after the sale, the station changed format to Young Country as 93.1 The Hound. Although it was designed as a flanker to protect sister station WWDM from Clear Channel Communications's country outlet WCOS-FM from being #1 in the ratings, 93.1 The Hound managed to gain a small audience. However, in 2005, after the sign-on of Double O Radio's New Country outlet WWNU, sister AM's WOIC ESPN Radio format moved to WZMJ, while WOIC was re-launched as an Air America Radio outlet.
On July 27, 2012, Lake Murray Communications, LLC took ownership of the station from YMF Media LLC (which had purchased the station from Inner City Broadcasting) and changed it to its current variety adult hits format, branded as "Z93 The Lake". 
The format features a wide variety of classic hits, classic rock & roll, oldies, Motown, and current adult contemporary hits. 
The Z93 music format was created by Mike Willis, a 40-year radio veteran, station owner & President/CEO of Lake Murray Communications, LLC. According to Willis, "The format is a product of my early broadcasting and radio station influences, such as WBBQ Augusta, GA; WKZQ Myrtle Beach; WLS Chicago; WABC & WNBC NYC; WLAC Nashville; and WOWO Ft. Wayne, Indiana.
93.1 WZMJ-FM is the Midlands home of Clemson University Athletics and airs local athletics of multiple high schools throughout Lexington County and Lake Murray (South Carolina)

Active for over 60 years, the 96th Bombardment Wing was a component organization of Strategic Air Command's deterrent force during the Cold War, as a strategic bombardment wing.
History.
World War II.
Constituted as 96th Bombardment Group (Heavy) on 28 January 1942. Activated on 15 July 1942. Trained with B-17's and also served as an operational training unit. Moved to RAF Grafton Underwood England, April–May 1943, for duty with Eighth Air Force. The group was assigned to the 45th Combat Bombardment Wing of the 3d Bombardment Division. Its tail code was Square-C. The group consisted of the following squadrons:
This group commenced combat operations on 14 May but, as it was assigned to the 45th Wing with a general base area in north Essex, the 96th moved east at the end of May to RAF Andrews Field. The 96th appears to have only carried out one mission while based at Andrews Field. On 29 May 1943 they took part in a raid on Rennes naval storage depot from which one B-17 failed to return. The group was moved to RAF Snetterton Heath on 12 June 1943 in a general exchange of bases with B-26 Marauder groups.
As the most conveniently reached station from 3rd Division Headquarters at Elveden Hall, Snetterton Heath units often led to major operations carrying commanding generals. General Curtis LeMay led the famous Regensburg shuttle mission to North Africa flying out of this base, and received a Distinguished Unit Citation for withstanding severe assaults by enemy fighters. The 96th also led the 3rd Division on the famous Schweinfurt mission of 14 October 1943. In addition, the 93d attacked shipyards, harbours, railway yards, aerodromes, oil refineries, aircraft factories, and other industrial targets in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.
The 96th received another DUC for leading the 45th Bomb Wing a great distance through heavy clouds and intense anti-aircraft fire to raid important aircraft component factories in Poland on 9 April 1944. Other significant targets included airfields at Bordeaux and Augsburg; marshalling yards at Kiel, Hamm, Brunswick, and Gdynia; aircraft factories at Chemnitz, Hanover, and Diósgyőr; oil refineries at Merseburg and Brux, and chemical works in Wiesbaden, Ludwigshafen, and Neunkirchen.
In addition to strategic operations, missions of the 96th BG included bombing coastal defences, railway bridges, gun emplacements, and field batteries in the battle area prior to and during the invasion of Normandy in June 1944; attacking enemy positions in support of the breakthrough at Saint-Lô in July 1944; aiding the campaign in France in August by striking roads and road junctions, and by dropping supplies to the Maquis; and attacking, during the early months of 1945, the communications supplying German armies on the western front.
After V-E Day, the group was scheduled for occupation duties in Germany however plans were revised and the 96th BG flew food to the Netherlands and hauled redeployed personnel to French Morocco, Ireland, France, and Germany. In November 1945 its aircraft were flown back to the United States, and its squadrons were inactivated. The ground personnel left Snetterton Heath in early December, arriving at Camp Kilmer New Jersey.
The 96th Bomb Group was inactivated on 20 December 1945.
Cold War.
The 96th Bomb Group was activated in the Reserves on 29 May 1947 at Gunter AFB, Alabama. Conducted routine training activities. Inactivated on 27 July 1949.
Established again on 6 November 1953 at Altus AFB, Oklahoma, as the 96th Bombardment Wing, Medium. It was activated 8 November. Wing headquarters and most of the wing components were not manned until March 1954; those components were controlled by the 96th Air Base Group, whose commander served additional duty as the 96th's wing commander. The wing soon received KC-97 Stratotankers and began air refueling operations in March 1954.
Began receiving new B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers in April 1955, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. Began bombardment training in April 1955 in support of SAC's global commitments. Deployed to Andersen AFB Guam, January–April 1957. Upon activation, the Wing was bestowed the lineage, legacy and honors of the USAAF World War II 96th Bomb Group.
Transferred to Dyess AFB, Texas on 8 September 1957. During the period from 1959 to 1963 the wing was commanded by Colonel Burton C. Andrus.
Controlled the 4th Strategic Support Squadron, a strategic airlift squadron, September 1959 – March 1961, and the 578th Strategic Missile Squadron, an Atlas F missile squadron, July 1961 – March 1965. The first Atlas missile went on alert in April 1962. The Atlas was phased out in March 1965.
In the early 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence, and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. In 1963, its three squadrons of B-47s (338th, 339th, 413th Bomb Squadrons) were replaced by one squadron (337th Bomb Squadron) of B-52s. The 96th received B-52Cs from the 99th Bomb Wing from Roswell, New Mexico . It was redesignated the 96th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, in March 1969. In the six months interval between 1969 and 1972, the wing personnel, and aircraft, deployed to the. Far East in support of the War in Vietnam. During most of this time, the 96BW also supported airborne nuclear alert missions over the North Pole in the "Cold War."
From 1980, the wing's 917th Air Refueling Squadron KC-135A aircraft regularly deployed to Europe, Alaska, and the Pacific to support SAC tanker task force requirements.
The 337th Bomb Squadron became the first squadron to operate the B-1B Lancer, after the arrival of the first aircraft in June 1985. In addition, the 338th Combat Crew Training Squadron (CCTS) received B-1Bs in June 1992. In October 1986, B-1Bs assumed SAC Cold War alert duties for the first time.
Wing 917th ARS KC-135 tankers provided refueling support to units involved in the invasion of Panama, December 1989. Ferried personnel and equipment to Andersen AFB, Guam for further movement to Southwest Asia, in August 1990. In December 1990 all remaining tanker aircraft and crews, except those on alert duty, were sent to Incirlik AB Turkey in support of Operation Desert Storm.
Post Cold War.
On 1 September 1991, the wing was redesignated as the 96th Wing and implemented the objective wing concept. It was relieved from assignment to SAC and assigned to Air Combat Command on 1 June 1992. Also on 1 June 1992, the 917 ARS acquired KC-135Qs in conjunction with the drawdown of tanker operations at Beale AFB, California.
In accordance with the realignment of tanker squadrons to Air Mobility Command, the 917 ARS was reassigned to the 43d Operations Group at Malmstrom AFB, Montana on 30 September 1993.
On 1 October 1993 the 96th Wing inactivated, replaced by the 7th Wing (7 WG), which was moved without personnel or equipment due to the BRAC transfer of Carswell AFB, Texas to the U.S. Navy and its redesignation as Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth/Carswell Field. The B-1Bs of the 337th BS were reassigned to the 7 WG, and the 337h BS was reorganized and absorbed the B-1s of the inactivating 338 Crew Training Squadron as part of the new wing.
The 96th Air Base Wing stood up as a non-flying organization on 15 March 1994. It assumed the mission of supporting the Air Armament Center and associate units at Eglin AFB, Florida.
2012 Air Force Material Command 5 Center Restructuring.
The wing was redesignated as the 96th Test Wing (merging the 96th Air Base Wing and the 46th Test Wing together), as part of the 2012 Air Force Material Command Restructuring. It is the test and evaluation unit for Air Force air-delivered weapons, navigation and guidance systems, Command and Control systems and Air Force Special Operations Command systems. 
The wing provides expert evaluation and validation of the performance of systems throughout the design, development, acquisition, and sustainment process to ensure the warfighter has technologically superior, reliable, maintainable, sustainable and safe systems. The 96th TW performs developmental test and evaluation across the complete system life cycle for a wide variety of customers including: Air Force Systems Program Offices, the Air Force Research Laboratory, logistics and product centers; major commands; other DoD services and U.S. government agencies (Department of Transportation, NASA, etc.); foreign military sales; and private industry. 
Additionally the wing commander serves as the installation commander, supporting Team Eglin with traditional military services as well as all the services of a small city, including civil engineering, personnel, logistics, communications, computer, medical, security, and all other host services. The Wing provides a myriad of base operating support functions like material resources, mobility requirements, and meeting the needs of Eglin personnel. 
There are seven distinct groups in the wing (see groups below), the Air Force Seek Eagle Office and more than 30 squadrons and divisions.

Magnetic trap (atoms)

A magnetic trap is an apparatus which uses a magnetic field gradient to trap neutral particles with magnetic moments. Although such traps have been employed for many purposes in physics research, they are best known as the last stage in cooling atoms to achieve Bose–Einstein condensation. The magnetic trap (as a way of trapping very cold atoms) was first proposed by David E. Pritchard.
Operating principle.
Many atoms have a magnetic moment; their energy shifts in a magnetic field according to the formula
According to the principles of quantum mechanics the magnetic moment of an atom will be quantized; that is, it will take on one of certain discrete values. If the atom is placed in a strong magnetic field, its magnetic moment will be aligned with the field. If a number of atoms are placed in the same field, they will be distributed over the various allowed values of magnetic quantum number for that atom.
If a magnetic field gradient is superimposed on the uniform field, those atoms whose magnetic moments are aligned with the field will have lower energies in a higher field. Like a ball rolling down a hill, these atoms will tend to occupy locations with higher fields and are known as "high-field-seeking" atoms. Conversely, those atoms with magnetic moments aligned opposite the field will have higher energies in a higher field, tend to occupy locations with lower fields, and are called "low-field-seeking" atoms.
It is impossible to produce a local maximum of the magnetic-field magnitude in free space; however, a local minimum may be produced. This minimum can trap atoms which are low-field-seeking if they do not have enough kinetic energy to escape the minimum. Typically, magnetic traps have relatively shallow field minima and are only able to trap atoms whose kinetic energies correspond to temperatures of a fraction of a kelvin. The field minima required for magnetic trapping can be produced in a variety of ways. These include permanent magnet traps, Ioffe configuration traps, QUIC traps and others.
Microchip atom trap.
The minimum magnitude of the magnetic field can be realized with the "atom microchip".
One of the first microchip atomic traps is shown on the right. The Z-shaped conductor (actually the golden Z-shaped strip painted on the Si surface) is placed into the uniform magnetic field (the field's source is not shown in the figure). Only atoms with positive spin-field energy were trapped. To prevent the mixing of spin states, the external magnetic field was inclined in the plane of the chip, providing the adiabatic rotation of the spin at the movement of the atom. In the first approximation, magnitude (but not orientation) of the magnetic field is responsible for effective energy of the trapped atom. The chip shown is 2 cm x 2 cm; this size was chosen for ease in manufacture. In principle, the size of such microchip traps can be drastically reduced. An array of such traps can be manufactured with conventional lithographic methods; such an array is considered a prototype of a q-bit memory cell for the quantum computer. Ways of transferring atoms and/or q-bits between traps are under development; the adiabatic optical (with off-resonant frequencies) and/or the electrical control (with additional electrodes) is assumed.
Applications in Bose–Einstein condensation.
Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) requires conditions of very high density and very low temperature in a gas of atoms. Laser cooling in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) is typically used to cool atoms down to the microkelvin range. However, laser cooling is limited by the momentum recoils an atom receives from single photons. Achieving BEC requires cooling the atoms beyond the limits of laser cooling, which means the lasers used in the MOT must be turned off and a new method of trapping devised. Magnetic traps have been used to hold very cold atoms, while evaporative cooling has reduced the temperature of the atoms enough to reach BEC.

Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif

An immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM), is a conserved sequence of amino acids (S/I/V/LxYxxI/V/L) that is found in the cytoplasmic tails of many inhibitory receptors of the immune system. After ITIM-possessing inhibitory receptors interact with their ligand, their ITIM motif becomes phosphorylated by enzymes of the Src kinases, allowing them to recruit other enzymes such as the phosphotyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, or the inositol-phosphatase called SHIP. These phosphatases decrease the activation of molecules involved in cell signaling. A list of human candidate ITIM-containing proteins has been generated by proteome-wide scans.

Sciences Library (Brown University)

The Sciences Library, nicknamed the "SciLi", at Brown University is a high-rise building in Providence, Rhode Island built in 1971. At , it is tied with One Citizens Plaza as the 13th-tallest building in the city. The building houses Brown University's primary on-campus collections that support study and research in the fields of Medicine, Psychology, Neural Science, Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science, and Pure and Applied Mathematics. SciLi is also the home of the Science Center, the Map Collection, the Interlibrary Loan office, and the Friedman Study Center. SciLi is one of five on campus libraries which comprise the University Library.
Completed in the Brutalist architectural style, the building is Brown University's primary science library. The school had been faced with the desire for vigorous expansion but had little real estate available, and the high-rise library was the school's solution.
Clashing with late 19th century and early 20th century colonial revival houses and abutting street-level shopping on Thayer Street, the Science Library is often seen as an imposing and obtrusive addition to College Hill. Architectural historian McKenzie Woodward condemns the building as "overwhelm everything around it", even comparing it to a Soviet-era Panelák when viewed from its "all-too-many distant viewing perspectives".
A 100 foot radio tower, erected in 1972, was removed from the building in 2005.
Friedman Study Center.
In 2006, the first and second floors and the basement of the Sciences Library underwent extensive renovations and were transformed into the Susan P. and Richard A. Friedman Study Center. The center includes a variety of seating, a cafe on the first floor, new computer clusters, and collaborative study rooms. This renovation was designed by Architecture Research Office, and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates.
Science Center.
In 2010, the third floor was renovated to create the "Science Center", a facility that supports teaching and learning in the sciences. The Center houses academic mentoring and support programs and serves as the campus clearinghouse for information about research and fellowship opportunities at Brown and around the world.

Francis Bertie Boyce

Francis Bertie Boyce (6 April 1844 – 27 May 1931) was an Australian clergyman and social reformer.
Early life.
Boyce was the son of Francis Boyce, an accountant, and his wife Frances, "née" Dunsford. He was born at Tiverton, Devonshire, England and was brought by his parents to Australia in the "Earl of Charlemont" and, after being shipwrecked off Barwon Heads, Victoria, arrived at Sydney in August 1853. Boyce was educated at St James Grammar School and at a private school kept by James Keane, and, his father having died in January 1858, entered the service of the Union Bank of Australia in the following December, and was with the bank for eight years.
Clerical career.
Boyce decided to enter the Church of England and went to Moore Theological College, Liverpool, at the beginning of 1867, was ordained deacon in December 1868 by Bishop Barker and priest on 19 December 1869. His first parish was George's Plains near Bathurst, New South Wales, followed by Molong in 1873 and Orange from 1875. Boyce was a hard-working and enthusiastic country clergyman, he travelled many miles on horseback to reach his people; he also raised money to build churches where no church had been before. The church built at Orange cost £7000, had accommodation for 600 people, and few seats were vacant when Boyce was holding the service. In April 1882 he went to Pyrmont, an industrial area, and in 1884 to St Paul's, Redfern. He remained there for 46 years, was elected a canon of St Andrew's cathedral in December 1899, and in 1910 was appointed archdeacon of West Sydney.
St Paul's, Redfern, when Boyce went to it was socially a mixed parish. In George- and Pitt-streets there were many wealthy people, while on the western side of the railway line there was a dense population and part of it was a slum area. Boyce had for some time shown much interest in the temperance question and was active in fights for local option and the earlier closing of hotels. When the New South Wales Alliance was founded in 1882 he was the first secretary and afterwards was its president for over 20 years. He published a volume titled "The Drink Problem in Australia" (1893), and later brought out other publications on religious and temperance questions. He was much distressed by the poverty of some parts of his parish and especially the position of men and women too old to work. He believed in old-age pensions, and on 9 September 1895 wrote to the "Sydney Daily Telegraph" advocating the appointment of a committee to inquire into and report on this question. Early in 1896 he called a meeting to form a pensions league. J. C. Neild had also been advocating the granting of pensions in parliament, and eventually a committee was appointed which recommended that pensions should be paid out of the public revenue. Boyce worked hard to keep the question before the public, but it was not until the end of the 19th century that pensions became law. The first pensions were paid on 1 July 1901.
Boyce was an ardent Imperialist, and when the question of having an Empire Day was raised in 1902 he supported the suggestion with enthusiasm. He was spokesman of a deputation which waited on Sir Edmund Barton, the prime minister, and he continued his efforts for it until it was founded on 24 May 1905. Boyce was first president of the British Empire League in Australia in 1901 and also in 1909-11.
Late life.
At meetings of the synod of the diocese of Sydney, Boyce took an important part, and he continued active work in his parish until extreme old age. He resigned his arch-deaconry in 1930 and died at Blackheath, New South Wales on 27 May 1931. He was married twice; firstly to Caroline, daughter of William Stewart, who died in 1918, and secondly to Mrs Ethel Burton, who survived him, with two sons by the first marriage. The elder son, Francis Stewart Boyce (1872-1940), became a KC in 1924 and a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1932.
Honours.
Mount Boyce is named in honour of Venerable Archdeacon Boyce.
Memorials to Boyce were placed in the Sydney and Bathurst cathedrals and his portrait by Julian Ashton was presented to the National Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1917. His memoirs were published posthumously in 1934 as "Four-Score Years and Seven."

Predictive value of tests

Predictive value of tests is the probability of a target condition (for example a disease) given by the result of a test, often in regard to medical tests.
A conversion of continuous values into binary values can be performed, such as designating a pregnancy test as "positive" above a certain cutoff value, but this confers a loss of information and generally results in less accurate predictive values.

347th Rescue Group

The United States Air Force's 347th Rescue Group is an active combat search and rescue unit assigned to the 23d Wing at Moody AFB, Georgia.
Mission.
The 347th Rescue Group directs flying and maintenance of the one of two USAF active-duty Groups dedicated to Combat Search and Rescue. Responsible for training/readiness of 1,100 personnel, including a pararescue squadron, two flying squadrons (Lockheed HC-130/HH-60 Pave Hawk), and an operations support squadron. Deploys worldwide in support of National Command Authority takings. Provides operational support for AETC tenant group (T-38 Talon/T-6 Texan II).
History.
Operational history.
World War II.
Constituted as the 347th Fighter Group on 29 September 1942. Activated in New Caledonia on 3 October 1942. Detachments of the group, which was assigned to Thirteenth Air Force in January 1943, were sent to Guadalcanal, where they used Bell P-39 and P-400 Airacobra aircraft to fly protective patrols, support ground forces, and attack Japanese shipping.
Operational squadrons of the 347th FG were the 67th, 68th, 70th and 339th Fighter Squadrons.
When the Allied campaign to recover the central and northern Solomon Islands began in February 1943, the detachments, still operating from Guadalcanal and using Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and P-39 Airacobras, escorted bombers and attacked enemy bases on New Georgia, the Russell Islands and Bougainville.
It was P-38Gs of the 339th Fighter Squadron which, on 18 April 1943, flew the mission which resulted in the death of Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Only their aircraft possessed the range to intercept and engage. Pilots were informed that they were intercepting an "important high officer," although they were not aware of who their actual target was.
On the morning of 18 April, despite urgings by local commanders to cancel the trip for fear of ambush, Yamamoto's planes left Rabaul as scheduled. Shortly after, eighteen specially fitted P-38s took off from Guadalcanal. They wave-hopped most of the 430 miles to the rendezvous point, maintaining radio silence throughout. At 09:34 Tokyo time, the two flights met and a dogfight ensued between the P-38s and the six Zeroes escorting Yamamoto.
1st Lt. Rex T. Barber engaged the first of the two Japanese bombers, which turned out to be Yamamoto's plane. He sprayed the plane with gunfire until it began to spew smoke from its left engine. Barber turned away to attack the other bomber as Yamamoto's plane crashed into the jungle. Afterwards, another pilot, Capt Thomas George Lanphier, Jr., claimed he had shot down the lead bomber, which led to a decades-old controversy until a team inspected the crash site to determine direction of the bullet impacts. Most historians now credit Barber with the claim.
One US pilot—1st Lt. Raymond K. Hine—was killed in action.
Headquarters moved up from New Caledonia at the end of 1943; and the following month the group moved from Guadalcanal to Stirling Island to support ground forces on Bougainville, assist in neutralizing enemy bases at Rabaul, and fly patrol and search missions in the northern Solomons.
The 347th was reassigned to New Guinea in August 1944, and equipped completely with P-38G's. Escorted bombers to oil refineries on Borneo; bombed and strafed airfields and installations on Ceram, Amboina, Boeroe, Celebes, and Halmahera. Received a Distinguished Unit Citation for a series of long-range bombing and strafing raids, conducted through intense flak and fighter defense, on the airfield and shipping at Makassar, Celebes, in November 1944.
Moved to the Philippines in February 1945. Supported landings on Mindanao in March 1945: bombed and strafed enemy installations and supported Australian forces on Borneo, attacked Japanese positions in northern Luzon, and flew escort missions to the Asiatic mainland.
The 347th Fighter Group was reassigned back to the United States in December 1945, and inactivated on 1 January 1946.
Cold War.
Occupied Japan.
The unit was redesignated as the 347th Fighter Wing (All Weather) and reactivated in Japan on 20 February 1947 as part of Far East Air Forces 315th Composite Wing to perform air defense duties. The wing was assembled from three former Northrop F-61B Black Widow night fighter squadrons, the 6th, 418th and 421st. The squadrons were redesignated the 339th, 4th and 68th squadrons, respectively. In August 1948, their designations were changed to Fighter (All Weather) Squadron to more closely identify their mission.
The 4th Fighter (All Weather) Squadron was deployed and attached to the 51st Fighter Group at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa.
The useful life of the F-61 was extended due to the Air Force's problems in fielding a jet-powered night/all weather fighter. The Curtiss XP-87/XF-87 Blackhawk was the planned replacement, however problems in development led the Black Widow to be replaced by another propeller-driven fighter, the North American F-82F/G Twin Mustang.
The Twin Mustangs started to arrive during mid-1949 and 1950. The 347th was the last active duty USAF unit to fly the Black Widow, the 339th FS retiring its last F-61 in May 1950, missing the Korean War by only a month.
Korean War.
As the war in Korea began, on 24 June 1950 the 347th Fighter Wing was inactivated and the 347th Fighter Group's Twin Mustang squadrons were transferred to South Korea. They were the only fighter aircraft available with the range to cover the entire Korean peninsula.
The 339th Squadron was attached to the 8th Fighter Wing at Kimpo Airfield, near Seoul South Korea to stem the North Korean advance. The 68th Fighter (AW) Squadron was based at Itazuke, Japan. The 4th (AW) Squadron was reaassigned to the provisional 6302d Air Base Group and provided air defense of Japan and the Ryukyu Islands.
The 347th Fighter Group provided fighter cover for the C-54 and C-47 transports flying in and out of Kimpo Airfield. On 27 June 1950, an F-82G (46–383) of the 68th Fighter (AW) Squadron flown by Lieut. William (Skeeter) Hudson (pilot) and Lieut. Carl Fraser (radar operator) shot down a North Korean Yak-7U (possibly a misidentified Yak-11). This was the first air-to-air kill of the Korean War, and, incidentally, the first aerial victory by the newly formed United States Air Force.
It is believed that Lt. Hudson was flying an F-82G named "Bucket of Bolts" (46–601) instead of his usual aircraft on that historic day. Later that same day, an F-82G (46–392) flown by Major James Little of the 339th Fighter (AW) Squadron of the 347th Fighter Group shot down a North Korean Yak-9. Records are unreliable, and some experts maintain that Major Little actually was the first to kill.
The 339th and 68th Fighter (AW) Squadrons served in South Korea until December 1950, being attached to the 8th FBW, the 35th FIW and 51st FIW. As more jets, especially the all-weather Lockheed F-94 Starfire, became available the F-82s were deligated to ground attack missions before eventually being withdrawn from the Korean Theater, modified, and reassigned to bomber escort duties at Ladd AFB, Alaska. With their F-82's reassigned to Alaska, the 347th Fighter Group was inactivated and stood down.
Japan.
The 347th Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at Yokota Air Base, Japan in December 1967 as part of Fifth Air Force. In Japan, the wing performed tactical fighter training missions, aerial reconnaissance and contingency operations. Its operational squadrons were the following:
The 35th, 36th and 80th TFS were equipped with the McDonnell-Douglas F-4C Phantom IIs and flew tactical fighter training missions. The 556th flew various electronic warfare and special operations sorties of a classified nature. The 34th TFS was in a deployed status to the 388th TFW, Korat RTAFB, Thailand. 347th F-4C aircrews would rotate TDY to and from the 34th TFS. Squadron transferred permanently to the 388th TFW, March 1971.
In 1971 the US and Japan agreed that all combat squadrons based at Yokota were to be reassigned and Yokota became a non-flying station hosted by the 475th Air Base Wing. 35th TFS aircraft were transferred to 67th TFS/18th TFW, Kadena Air Base Okinawa. The 36th and 80th TFS aircraft were transferred to 3d TFW, Kusan AB, South Korea. The 554th TRS's B-57s were reassigned to the 363d TRW at Shaw AFB, South Carolina. The C-130s were retained at Yokota and reassigned to the incoming 475th Air Base Wing.
The 347th TFW was inactivated in place in May 1971 prior to reassignment to the United States.
Mountain Home AFB.
The 347th was reactivated and reequipped with factory-fresh General Dynamics F-111F Aardvarks, replacing the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing as host unit at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho in May 1971. Operational squadrons of the wing were:
The 4589th/4590th TFS were provisional units, pending the transfer of the 389th and 390th TFSs from the 12th and 366th TFWs in Southeast Asia. All three squadrons adopted the MO tail code under the common wing concept in June 1972.
The 347th had a short stay at Mountain Home, conducting F-111F training until October 1972, when it was replaced by the 366th TFW which moved from Takhli RTAFB, Thailand to Mountain Home. Upon its arrival, the 366th absorbed all the people and equipment of the 347th.
Takhli RTAFB.
On 30 July 1973 the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, inheriting two squadrons of F-111As from the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing, which ended its TDY at Takhli from Nellis AFB, Nevada. These were:
For a brief two-week period the 347th flew combat operations into Cambodia until 15 August, when the last wartime mission of the Vietnam Era was flown for final mission of Constant Guard. After the ceasefire, the wing was maintained in a combat-ready status for possible contingency actions.
During January 1974 the Secretary of Defense announced a realignment of Thailand resources, with the final pullout of air resources by the end of 1976. In June 1974, two F-111s from the 347th TFW flew from Takhli to Osan Air Base South Korea and conducted live weapons demonstrations for Republic of Korea and US officials at Nightmare Range.
Takhli RTAFB was returned to the Royal Thai Air Force in July 1974, with the 347th inactivating in place.
Korat RTAFB.
With the return of Takhli to the Royal Thai Air Force, the two F-111 squadrons (428th, 429th TFS) of the 347th were transferred to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base. The 347th TFW was activated in place on 12 July 1974.
At Korat, the 347th performed training readiness missions. It participated in the recovery of the SS Mayaguez, an American merchant ship, from the Khmer Rouge Cambodians, 13–14 May 1975.
On 30 June 1975, the two F-111A squadrons were inactivated. The aircraft were sent to the 422d Fighter Weapon Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The 347th TFW was reassigned to Moody AFB, Georgia.
Moody AFB.
On 1 December 1975 the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at Moody AFB, Georgia as a tactical fighter wing under Tactical Air Command. Operational fighter squadrons at Moody were:
The 347th flew the McDonnell-Douglas F-4E until 1988, upgrading to the Block 15 General Dynamics F-16A/B. In 1990 the wing upgraded again to the Block 40 F-16C/D. Moody won the Commander-in-Chief's Installation Excellence Award for 1991, and the 1994 Verne Orr Award, which is presented by the Air Force Association to the unit that most effectively uses human resources to accomplish its mission. In June 1997, the 347th TFW was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for the eighth time in its illustrious history.
On 1 October 1991, the 347th TFW was redesignated the 347th Fighter Wing. On 1 June 1992 the 347th FW was assigned to the newly activated Air Combat Command.
As a result of the August 1992 destruction of Homestead AFB Florida by Hurricane Andrew, the 31st Fighter Wing's 307th and 308th Fighter Squadrons were initially evacuated to Moody AFB prior to the hurricane making landfall. With Homstead unusable for an extended period after the hurricane, on 20 November the squadrons were permanently assigned to the 347th TFW. On 1 April 1994, the 308th FS was moved without personnel or equipment to the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke AFB, Arizona, replacing the 311th FS. The squadrons Block 40 F-16s were sent to USAFE.
On 1 July 1994, the Air Force redesignated the 347th Fighter Wing to the 347th Wing, a force projection, air/land composite wing. Squadrons of the 347th Wing were:
The 307th FS was inactivated on 31 August 1995 when F-16 operations at Moody were reduced in size.
On 1 April 1997 the 347th Wing added a search-and-rescue component with the addition of the 41st Rescue Squadron with HH-60G helicopters and the 71st Rescue Squadron with specialized HC-130P aircraft from Patrick AFB, Florida. To make room for these squadrons, the 52d Airlift Squadron was inactivated, with its C-130s being transferred to the 71st RQS.
The F-16s of the 347th began to be transferred out as the "Composite Wing" concept ended at Moody. The 70th FS was inactivated on 30 June 2000. The 69th FS was inactivated on 2 February 2001, and the 68th FS was inactivated on 1 April. The F-16s were transferred to various active-duty, reserve and Air National Guard squadrons both in the CONUS as well as overseas.
On 1 May 2001, the 347th Wing stood down as a composite wing and stood up as the 347th Rescue Wing, becoming the Air Force's only active-duty combat search and rescue wing. The 347th RQW was transferred from ACC to the Air Force Special Operations Command on 1 October 2003.

<doc id="9783546" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9783546" title="Village Free School">
Village Free School

The Village Free School (VFS) is a non-profit 501(c)3 private school located in Portland, Oregon, United States. The school opened its doors to students in the fall of 2003. The school offers enrollment to students ages 5–18. The educational philosophy at the Village Free School is based upon the idea that if children are given freedom and access to resources, they will learn. Students at VFS choose what they want to learn and how they want to spend their time.
Admissions are designed so that many ages are represented, and enrollment in each age group is limited. Off-campus learning is encouraged and facilitated by staff at the free school.
Families.
Parents are integral to the mission of VFS, so the school honors the primary attachments of youth with their families and values the dignity and worth of students, staff, families, and volunteers alike. Many different kinds of families find homes here, and families with nontraditional backgrounds are welcome. The school does its best to support, share, and learn from all the people who come to the Village.
Broader community.
VFS shares what they learn about active youth participation and self-determination with educators and advocates around the world. During the summers of 2007 and 2008, students, parents, and staff attended the AERO Conference on Alternative Education in New York. This allowed those from the Village to share what they've learned with other free and democratic schools, offered students hands-on leadership and speaking opportunities, and allowed the school to learn.
Advisers.
The school has adult advisers who assist youth with accessing resources, and encourage students to ask questions, explore, and play as their intellectual, social, emotional, and physical health are nurtured. Staff believe that when kids learn the art of problem solving in a holistic way, their skills can be applied to any subject.
Physical space.
VFS offers vibrant and interactive spaces to study, play, and share. Students are not coerced into following a schedule dictated by standardized curriculum or testing. However, there is a daily rhythm to help students know when and where opportunities are being offered.
History.
The Village Free School started in 2005 after three years of planning by a group of folks who mostly learned about each other from fliers posted at co-ops. Surprisingly, few of these initial school-starters were parents; they were people who wanted to give kids a shot at freedom and democracy, with the hope of creating a natural love for learning.
Non-profit.
The Village Free School is non-profit, and thus relies upon donations and sponsorships to cover the costs related to running the program. 
Accreditation.
The Village Free School has chosen not to seek accreditation through the State of Oregon, as it did not want to be held to any state standards that would interfere with the educational approach. Since each student's education plan at the school is highly individualized, lack of state accreditation is not seen as a barrier. College is a perfectly reasonable option for those who want to attend, and the school will support those students in their efforts. (The school also supports the efforts of youth who are on different life paths.)

Route 286 (Delaware–Maryland)

Delaware Route 286 (DE 286) and Maryland Route 286 (MD 286) is a , two-lane roadway in New Castle County, Delaware, and Cecil County, Maryland. The route begins as MD 286 at George Street, which is one of the segments of unsigned MD 537C, and heads east within Chesapeake City to the Delaware state line. Here, the road becomes DE 286 and continues east to DE 15 near Summit Bridge. The road roughly parallels the south side of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal through and passes through development in Chesapeake City and rural areas.
It is called 2nd Street in Chesapeake City, Bethel Road between Chesapeake City and the Delaware border, and Bethel Church Road within Delaware. MD 286 was constructed around 1930. The roadway in Delaware was paved in the 1930s. MD 286 originally served the lost community of Bethel near the state line, but was rerouted to the Delaware state line in the early 1960s due to expansion of the canal. DE 286 was designated in the 1990s.
Route description.
MD 286 runs between MD 537C in Chesapeake City and the Delaware border along 2nd Street through Chesapeake City and Bethel Road east of Chesapeake City. MD 286 has an annual average daily traffic count (AADT) of 1,380 vehicles. DE 286 runs from the Maryland border east to DE 15 along Bethel Church Road. DE 286 has an AADT of 3,519 vehicles. Neither route is part of the National Highway System.
Maryland.
MD 286 begins at an intersection with George Street (unsigned MD 537C) on the south side of Chesapeake City. The state highway heads east as two-lane 2nd Street through the South Chesapeake City Historic District. At Bohemia Avenue, MD 286 becomes Bethel Road and curves around the Back Creek Mooring Basin. After crossing Back Creek, the state highway makes a right-angle turn at the entrance to the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Museum. MD 286 leaves the town limits of Chesapeake City and passes through a forested area along the south boundary of the Canal Wildlife Management Area. Shortly after the intersection with Bethel Cemetery Road, the old alignment of MD 286, the state highway reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line.
Delaware.
DE 286 begins at the Maryland border and continues east on two-lane, undivided Bethel Church Road through farmland. A short distance later, the road runs between residential developments. The road then passes between homes to the north and rural areas to the south before becoming lined with farms on both sides. DE 286 reaches its eastern terminus at DE 15, which heads south on Choptank Road and east on Bethel Church Road, at a roundabout.
History.
MD 286 originally connected Chesapeake City with Bethel, a small community on the south side of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal just west of the state line. The state highway was paved from George Street, which is the original alignment of U.S. Route 213 (US 213, now MD 213), east along Bethel Road and then north along what is now Bethel Cemetery Road in 1930. MD 286 was disconnected from US 213 when the Chesapeake City Bridge was completed in 1948 and George Street was designated MD 537C. In 1954, the United States Congress approved for the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to be widened to and the depth increased to . The canal was expanded as it was not big enough to accommodate large ships and there were frequent collisions between ships and bridges. The community of Bethel was evacuated shortly before the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal was expanded in the 1960s. Most of the buildings in the community, including the church, were demolished. As a result of the canal expansion, MD 286 was removed from Bethel Cemetery Road and extended east to the state line in 1961. Bethel Cemetery Road presently leads to a dead end at the canal where Bethel once existed.
By 1920, what is now DE 286 existed as an unimproved county road. The road in Delaware was paved by 1936 and served as part of the route between Summit Bridge and Chesapeake City. Bethel Church Road from the state line east to DE 15 was designated DE 286 around 1994, extending the number from MD 286.

List of St. Louis Cardinals seasons

The St. Louis Cardinals, a professional baseball franchise based in St. Louis, Missouri, compete in the National League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). Founded in 1882 as a charter member of the American Association (AA), the team was originally named the Brown Stockings before it was shortened to Browns the next season. The team moved to the National League in 1892 when the AA folded. The club changed its name to the Perfectos for one season in 1899 and adopted the Cardinals name in 1900. The St. Louis Cardinals are tied with the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates as the third-oldest continuously-operated baseball team. In that time, the team has won 19 National League pennants and 11 World Series championships (most in the National League and second only to the New York Yankees, who have won 27). They also won four American Association pennants and one pre-World Series championship that Major League Baseball does not consider official.
The Cardinals have enjoyed six periods of continued success during their history. The first period occurred during the 1880s when the team won four consecutive American Association pennants from 1885–1888 while known as the Browns. The Cardinals next enjoyed success from 1926–1934 when they played in five World Series, winning three. During World War II the Cardinals won four NL pennants in five years from 1942–1946, including three World Series championships. During the 1960s the Cardinals won two World Series and played in another. In the 1980s the Cardinals played in three World Series, winning in 1982. Most recently, the Cardinals have made the playoffs nine times, winning seven NL Central titles and qualifying as a wild-card entrant in 2000, 2011 and 2012, winning the World Series in 2006 and 2011.
The only extended period of failure the Cardinals have experienced began when they joined the National League in 1892. The Cardinals played only five winning seasons in thirty years while finishing last seven times from their entrance to the NL until 1921. However, the Cardinals have remarkably avoided such failure since then as they have not finished in last place in the National League since 1918, by far the longest streak in the NL. The Cardinals failed to reach the World Series in the 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s, but were regularly a competitive team in each of these decades.

Arc Angels

Arc Angels are a blues rock band formed in Austin, Texas in the early 1990s. The band was composed of guitarist and singers Doyle Bramhall II and Charlie Sexton and two former members of Stevie Ray Vaughan's band Double Trouble, drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon. The 'Arc' in the band's name came from the Austin Rehearsal Complex where the band first started jamming.
History.
Their 1992 debut album, "Arc Angels", met with critical approval and reached No. 127 on the "Billboard" chart. Arc Angels made their network television debut on the NBC show, "Late Night with David Letterman", on June 9, 1992, performing "Living In A Dream". They performed on the show again on January 6, 1993, this time playing "Too Many Ways to Fall".
Bramhall's heroin addiction and internal friction caused the breakup of the band in 1993. The Arc Angels broke up in October of that year, concluding their run with a series of farewell concerts at Austin's Backyard outdoor venue. Beginning in 2002, the Arc Angels reunited for occasional live performances.
In recent years, Bramhall has played guitar in Eric Clapton's band and toured with Roger Waters. Charlie Sexton has toured with Bob Dylan. Meanwhile, Layton and Shannon have recorded three albums with the Texas soul quintet Storyville. They have also backed such artists as Buddy Guy, Kenny Wayne Shepherd and John Mayer.
In March 2009, the members of Arc Angels, minus Shannon, announced that they would be reuniting, releasing a live album and DVD of concert footage/audio taken during 2005, touring extensively and beginning work on their second album. The album/DVD "Living in a Dream" was released in 2009, containing live renditions of previously released Arc Angels songs, new songs performed live and two new studio tracks. The launch of their tour was at Austin's annual South by Southwest Festival. Although the band never officially broke up again, members pursued solo projects and there have been no talks about future Arc Angels releases or concerts to this date.

Western mastiff bat

The western mastiff bat (Eumops perotis), also known as the western bonneted bat, the greater mastiff bat, or the greater bonneted bat, is a member of the free-tailed bat family, Molossidae. It is found in the Western United States, Mexico and South America, and is the largest bat native to North America. The subspecies "Eumops perotis californicus" is a species of concern as identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The range of this subspecies is principally southwest desert regions of the United States, along the border with Mexico; however, the range extends as far north on the Pacific coast to Alameda County, California.
Description.
The western mastiff bat has a body length of and a wingspan of over . It has chocolate brown fur and thirty teeth. The body mass of this species can range from .
Behavior.
The western mastiff bat needs at least of open space under its roosting spot for takeoff. Its echolocationary squeaks, which are inaudible to humans in most bats, can be heard from up to away. During the day they form colonies of less than 100. Unlike most North American bats, they do not undergo either migration or prolonged hibernation, but are periodically active all winter.
Diet.
It feeds on insects, up to 80% of which are moths. It will often drop down and forage on the ground with its tail sticking up.

Murtogh O'Brien-Arra

Murtogh O'Brien (born c.1545) was an Anglican bishop of Killaloe, in County Clare, Ireland. 
He was a 17th generation descendant of Brian Boru, in the branch of the clan O'Brien known as O'Brien-Arra, from County Tipperary. His seat was St. Flannan's Cathedral in Killaloe, which was actually built by his 10-Great Grandfather, Donal Ó Briain, King of Thomond, King of Munster, in the later 12th century. It is named for Saint Flannan Uí Thoirdhealbhaigh, son of Toirdhealbhach Uí Bloid, a direct ancestor of Bishop O'Brien. 
Murtogh was born to Roman Catholic parents, Turlogh Ó Briain and Máire Ó Cearbhaill. He was educated in England at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and became an Anglican priest. On May 15, 1570, he was appointed Protestant Bishop of Killaloe by Elizabeth I; however, he was not conescrated until six years later. 
Even before his appointment, because of his family's position of power in the kingdom of Thomond, O'Brien received all of the profits from that see. O'Brien ruled his diocese for 36 years before voluntarily retiring in 1612. He married Slaney O'Brien, of Clan O'Brien, Inchiquin branch. She was the daughter of Murrough O'Brien, Baron of Inchiquin. They were known to have two sons; Turlogh O'Brien and John O'Brien. O'Brien died on April 30, 1613 in Killaloe.

This gives more interest to the students so that they can remember lessons better. Teachers of this school try to use scientific and efficient methods to make knowledge easier to understand and memorize. This makes the qualification and the results be more and more promising. Most of the teachers are also friendly and academically well-trained, so the stress of schoolwork on students can be reduced. A large number of Tran Dai Nghia high school students can speak English fluently, as a result of the school's focus on foreign language. Aside from English, high school students majoring in D-block subjects are also taught French or German. In addition, classes of grade 10, 11 and 12 are ranged in to specializing classes such as English majoring class, Math majoring class, Literature majoring class, Chemistry majoring class and Physics majoring class. There are also triple-subjected classes: Math-Chemistry-Physics and Math-Literature-English classes. A growing number of scholarships are won by students, which provide opportunities of further study abroad. 
Indoors and outdoors activities.
The school is a semi-boarding one in which students stay from 7:00 am to 4:10 pm or 5:00 pm, depending the number of classes.
Classes are broken into 4 periods for grade-6,7,8 students and 5 periods for the rest in the morning. Lunch time is thus various: grade-6,7,8 students are supposed to have lunch at 10:20, whilst grade-9,10,11,12 ones at 11:15. In the afternoon, classes start at 1:15 and usually last until 4:10, sometimes 5:00. On Saturday, students in selection teams gather to take extra classes on the subject they major. After that, they can go home or attend some outdoor activities.
Basketball, badminton, volleyball, chess and soccer classes are also carried out after school, which is widely popular to students who want to improve their physical and mental condition. Half-court basketball is also regularly played after school between students.
There are a lot of contests and competitions so every student can show their abilities and be more energetic and flexible in life:

Trefftz method

In mathematics, the Trefftz method is a method for the numerical solution of partial differential equations named after the German mathematician Erich Trefftz (1888–1937). It falls within the class of finite element methods.
Introduction.
The hybrid Trefftz finite-element method has been considerably advanced since its introduction about 30 years ago. The conventional method of finite element analysis involves converting the differential equation that governs the problem into a variational functional from which element nodal properties – known as field variables – can be found. This can be solved by substituting in approximate solutions to the differential equation and generating the finite element stiffness matrix which is combined with all the elements in the continuum to obtain the global stiffness matrix. Application of the relevant boundary conditions to this global matrix, and the subsequent solution of the field variables rounds off the mathematical process, following which numerical computations can be used to solve real life engineering problems.
An important aspect of solving the functional requires us to find solutions which satisfy the given boundary conditions and satisfy inter-element continuity since we define independently the properties over each element domain.
The hybrid Trefftz method differs from the conventional finite element method in the assumed displacement fields and the formulation of the variational functional. In contrast to the conventional method (based on the Rayleigh-Ritz mathematical technique) the Trefftz method (based on the Trefftz mathematical technique) assumes the displacement field is composed of two independent components; the intra-element displacement field which satisfies the governing differential equation and is used to approximate the variation of potential within the element domain, and the conforming frame field which specifically satisfies the inter-element continuity condition, defined on the boundary of the element. The frame field here is the same as that used in the conventional finite element method but defined strictly on the boundary of the element – hence the use of the term “hybrid” in the method’s nomenclature. The variational functional must thus include additional terms to account for boundary conditions, since the assumed solution field only satisfies the governing differential equation.
Advantages over conventional finite element method.
The main advantages of the hybrid Trefftz method over the conventional method are:
Applications.
Since its mainstream introduction some 30 years ago, this modified finite element method has become increasingly popular to applications such as elasticity, Kirchhoff plates, thick plates, general three-dimensional solid mechanics, antisymmetric solid mechanics, potential problems, shells, elastodynamic problems, geometrically nonlinear plate bending, and transient heat conduction analysis among various others. It is currently being applied to steady, non-turbulent, incompressible, Newtonian fluid flow applications through ongoing research at the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT) at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, Australia. The hybrid Trefftz method is also being applied to some fields, e.g. computational modeling of hydrated soft tissues or water-saturated porous media, through ongoing research project at the Technical University of Lisbon, Instituto Superior Técnico in Portugal.

Yukiko Kada

She was first elected in 2006, defeating incumbent governor Yoshitsugu Kunimatsu. She became the first female governor of Shiga and only the fifth female governor in Japanese history. She then enjoyed a landslide re-election victory in 2010. Behind her popular campaign slogan "mottainai" (translating roughly to "Don't Waste"), Gov. Kada captured 420,000 votes, which was the largest total of any in the history of Shiga Prefecture's gubernatorial elections. She was supported by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and led the Tomorrow Party of Japan (TPJ), which was founded shortly before the 2012 general election. The TPJ performed poorly in the election and all of its diet members except for Tomoko Abe left the party shortly afterwards, leading to the loss of its status as a national party. National party status in Japan requires five sitting diet members.
After the Shiga prefectural assembly passed a resolution requesting Kada to stop doubling as governor and the head of the TPJ, she resigned as head of the party on January 4, 2013.

Yoficator

Yoficator () is a computer program or extension for a text editor that restores the Cyrillic letter Yo ‹› in Russian texts in places where the letter Ye ‹› was used instead. The majority of newspapers and publishers use Ye in all contexts, assuming that an educated reader can distinguish which letter is meant. This creates a large number of homographs (but not homophones), and this is the problem the yoficator is intended to fix.
The problem of choice between Ye and Yo in spelling can be fairly complex and requires a deep analysis of the context. Therefore yoficators capable of completely solving this problem automatically do not yet exist. The existing yoficators rely on specially created databases of Russian words containing the letter Yo, and either replace Ye by Yo only in indisputable cases (""incomplete"" or ""quick yofication"") or work interactively leaving the choice to the user in uncertain cases (as, for example, the choice between "" — "everyone" and "" — "everything"). 
The term "yoficator" is also used to mean "one who yoficates", or, in the broad sense of the word, "a supporter of using the letter Yo".

Rufus Isaacs (game theorist)

Rufus Philip Isaacs (1914–1981) was a game theorist especially prominent in the 1950s and 1960s with his work on differential games.
Biography.
Isaacs was born on 11 June 1914 in New York City. He worked for the RAND Corporation from 1948 until winter 1954/1955. His investigation stemmed from classic pursuit-evasion type zero-sum dynamic two player games such as the Princess and monster game. In 1942, He married Rose Barcov, and they had two daughters.
His work in pure mathematics included working with monodiffric functions, fractional order mappings, graph theory, analytic functions, and number theory. In graph theory he constructed the first two infinite families of snarks. In applied mathematics, he worked with aerodynamics, elasticity, optimization, and differential games, which he is most known for. He received his bachelors from MIT in 1936, and received his MA and PhD from Columbia University in 1942 and 1942 respectively. His first post after the war ended was at Notre Dame, but he left in 1947 due to salary issues. While at RAND, much of his work was classified, and thus remained unknown until the publication of his classic text on differential games a decade after leaving RAND. His career after RAND was spent largely in the defense and avionics industries. While at RAND, he worked with researchers including Richard E. Bellman, Leonard D. Berkovitz, David H. Blackwell, John M. Danskin, Melvin Dresher, Wendell H. Fleming, Irving L. Glicksberg, Oliver A. Gross, Samuel Karlin, John W. Milnor, John F. Nash, and Lloyd S. Shapley. His work has significant influence on mathemtical optimization including fundamental concepts such as dynamic programming (Richard E. Bellman) and the Pontryagin maximum principle (Breitner 2005) which are widely used in economics and many other fields.

Eta Cephei

Eta Cephei (η Cep, η Cephei) is a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Cepheus. It shares the name Al Kidr with θ Cep, although the meaning of this name is unknown. This star, along with α Cep (Alderamin) and β Cep (Alfirk), were identified as Al Kawākib al Firḳ (الكوكب الفرق), meaning "the Stars of The Flock" by Ulug Beg. With an apparent visual magnitude of 3.4, this is a third magnitude star that, according to the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, is readily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements put it at a distance of from Earth.
In Chinese, (), meaning "Celestial Hook", refers to an asterism consisting of η Cephei, 4 Cephei, HD 194298, θ Cephei, α Cephei, ξ Cephei, 26 Cephei, ι Cephei and ο Cephei. Consequently, η Cephei itself is known as (, .).
Eta Cephei is a subgiant star with a stellar classification of K0 IV, which indicates it is exhausting the supply of hydrogen at its core and is in the process of evolving into a giant star. With 1.6 times the Sun's mass, at an age of 2.5 billion years it has reached a radius four times larger than the Sun and a luminosity ten times greater. It is radiating this energy from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 4,950 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star. Eta Cephei has a high proper motion across the celestial sphere and a large peculiar velocity of .
Hunt for substellar objects.
According to Nelson & Angel (1998), Eta Cephei would show two significant periodicities of 164 days and 10 years respectively, hinting at the possible presence of one or more jovian planets in orbit around the subgiant. The authors have set an upper limit of 0.64 Jupiter masses for the putative inner planet and 1.2 Jupiter masses for the putative outer one. Also Campbell et al. (1988) inferred the existence of planetary objects or even brown dwarfs less massive than 16.3 Jupiter masses.
However, more recent studies have not yet confirmed the existence of any substellar companion around Eta Cephei. McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the presence of one or more planets with masses between 0.13 and 2.4 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 AU.

WSDS

WSDS is a radio station in Superior Charter Township, Michigan, that broadcasts at 1480 kHz. Known as "La Explosiva," WSDS carries an all-Spanish schedule featuring contemporary music from a wide variety of genres, most notably Regional Mexican but also including romantica, Spanish rock, salsa, Hurban, and reggaeton. The station prides itself on being the only 24-hour Spanish-language radio station on traditional analog radio serving the Detroit area (although WYCD-FM features a Spanish Contemporary format called "Muevete" on one of its HD side channels). WSDS previously had a classic country music format until its sale to Birach Broadcasting from Koch Broadcasting.
WSDS began broadcasting in 1963 as WYSI (Ypsilanti), airing a Top 40 format; by 1966, the station had switched to country music format. In 1968, WSDS adopted a new strategy of focusing on the western suburbs of Detroit, using the slogan "We Serve Detroit's Suburbs" and sending its broadcasting van to events in the area; this focus faded away by 1980. By the early 2000s, "Suds" was still playing country music but had become a classic country station out of necessity, since major record labels were no longer supplying the station with current product. Weekends included specialty programming in Chinese and Spanish, as well as some classic rock and roll oldies.
"La Explosiva" was born in July 2001 when Alex Resendez and Rafael Barrios, two local Mexican-American radio personalities, leased time on WSDS for three hours of Regional Mexican music programming weekly. By 2005, the station, by then sold to ethnic broadcaster Sima Birach, was airing five hours of "La Explosiva" programming six days a week, and in June of that year, "La Explosiva" became a 24-hour format over WSDS. 
As of February 2011, the format was simulcasted to WWCS in Pittsburgh but on January 1st, 2012 the format changed to Fox Sports Radio. [http://www.pbrtv.com/blog/entry_1500.php]
In April 2012, Birach sold WSDS, pending FCC approval, to Vazquez Broadcasting. The sale was consummated on July 1, 2013, at a price of $1.45 million.

PlayStation Store

The PlayStation Store is an online virtual market available to users of Sony's PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Portable game consoles via the PlayStation Network. The store offers a range of downloadable content both for purchase and available free of charge. Available content includes full games, add-on content, playable demos, themes and game and movie trailers. The service is accessible through an icon on the XMB on the PS3 and PSP, its own column on the PS4 and an icon on the LiveArea on the PS Vita, in addition to consoles, the service is also available online via the Sony Entertainment Network official website. As of September 24, 2009, there have been over 600 million downloads from the PlayStation Store worldwide.
The PlayStation Store is updated with new content each Tuesday in North America, and each Wednesday in PAL regions. In May 2010, this was changed from Thursdays to allow PSP games to be released digitally, closer to the time they are released to retail.
The PlayStation Store was unavailable worldwide due to the PlayStation Network outage in April 2011. The service has been fully restored in Sony's American and European markets since June 2, 2011.
Access.
PSN Master Account.
A "master" PlayStation Network account is required to access the PlayStation Store. A log of all previously purchased items, known as "Download List", records each PlayStation Store account's complete download activity. A guest user can use their master account's Download List to download free content or to purchase content on another console, however, a single account can only be used on up to two consoles. This was previously five, but as of November 2011, Sony reduced this to two. The most recent firmware must be installed on the console in order to access the PlayStation Store.
Each master account is associated with an online virtual "wallet" to which funds can be added. This wallet is then debited when a purchase is made from the store. Money can be added to the wallet through different systems of payment, although some of these are not available in all countries.
Currency.
All purchases on the PlayStation Store are made in the user's local currency using a 'wallet' system whereby funds are added to the wallet – either in set denominations or an amount dictated by the price of the current transaction – then debited from the account's wallet when the user makes a purchase, funds added to the PS Store are non-refundable. Unlike Microsoft's Xbox Games Store as well as Nintendo's Wii Shop Channel and Nintendo DSi Shop, the PlayStation Store used local currencies from launch whereas Microsoft and Nintendo relied on their own proprietary currency (Microsoft Points and Nintendo Points, respectively) early on but have since moved to a local currency payment system prior to the launch of their respective eighth generation systems: Xbox One and Wii U.
The user can add funds to their wallet in a number of ways, the most common of which is by credit or debit card. Users in many regions can also purchase PlayStation Network Cards or Tickets in set denominations from retailers including supermarkets or video game stores. These funds are redeemed on the PlayStation Store when the user enters the unique 12-digit code found on the card into the PlayStation Store. Nintendo themselves later adopted this currency system for their succeeding eShop. The Store's account however is region locked and generally only accepts credit card that is billed in and PlayStation Network Cards purchased from the same country selected during the registration process, which cannot be changed afterwards.
As of the July 3rd, the UK users of the store can top up their wallet via a mobile phone, with the user paying for the funds through their phone bill.
In Japan, users may use the Edy e-money system. With a USB IC card reader/writer called PaSoRi, users can add funds to their wallet by swiping a smart card across the device.
PlayStation Store for PS3.
The PlayStation Store was launched on the PlayStation 3 on November 11, 2006 and is accessible via an icon under the PlayStation Network category of the XMB. There are four different versions of the PlayStation Store: Asia, Europe (including Oceania and the Middle East), Japan, and North America (including Latin America). Content may vary per country. There is no PlayStation Store in China.
Qore and FirstPlay.
"Qore" (pronounced like "core"), presented by the PlayStation Network, announced on June 3, 2008 by SCEA, was a subscription-based interactive online magazine for the PlayStation Network, which launched on the PlayStation Store in North America on June 5, 2008. The service ended in 2012 due to budget considerations and the restructuring of PlayStation brand priorities.
"FirstPlay" (previously known as "Official PlayStation Magazine HD" or "OPMHD") is an electronic magazine similar to Qore, produced by Future Publishing. Released in April 2010, it is available to PlayStation 3 users via the PlayStation Store in the UK. Like Qore, "FirstPlay" offers exclusive videos, demos and downloads. but is released weekly instead of monthly.
Multitasking.
As of March 22, 2007, background downloading became possible while watching a video stored on the HDD, listening to music, looking at photos, using the web browser and playing PS1, or offline PS3 games. Officially 16 downloads can be queued up at a time. The status of the downloads can only be checked on the XMB under the "Network" category. If the messaging service is enabled, a pop-up message will appear in the top right corner of the screen to notify the user that a download is finished.
Connectivity with PlayStation Vita.
Cross-platform content such as emulated PlayStation games, PS Vita games and demos, and minis, can be transferred from the PlayStation 3 to the PS Vita via a wired connection.
Connectivity with PlayStation Portable.
Some cross-platform store content such as emulated PlayStation games and demos can be transferred from the PlayStation 3 to the PlayStation Portable's Memory Stick via a USB connection.
After the installation of firmware version 5.00 released on October 15, 2008, the PlayStation Store can be accessed directly from the PSP without the need to use a PC or PS3 as an intermediary. It is accessible under the "PlayStation Network" category on the PSP's XMB. However, users who do not have any method for connecting wirelessly can still use the PlayStation Store on the PC using Media Go.
Redesigns.
Following feedback from a large number of PlayStation Network users, a redesigned version of the PlayStation Store was launched on April 15, 2008 via a firmware update. The new design was OS based rather than the previous Store's web based design enabling the Store to process information more quickly. 
A minor update to the store was released during Sony's E3 2009 press conference. This update makes the top page rotate pictures (including their links) regularly, and changes the navigation sounds.
A major redesign of the PlayStation Store was announced in September 2012, bringing with it a revised navigation structure and new search system. The new store has been developed to bring game and video content together and make it easier for users to find what they are looking for. Content will be integrated into each game's listing, rather than separate categories for items like add-ons, themes, and other downloadable content. The latest design is much less focused on text, and incorporates high-resolution artwork and smooth animations for featured content. The new redesign launched in Europe on October 22, 2012. Shortly after it was launched in the United Kingdom, the Store interface was reverted to the old design due to issues such as long load times and slow navigation, while other countries in Europe retained the new interface despite these issues. The redesign was released in North America on November 2, 2012.
PlayStation Store for PS Vita.
The PlayStation Store was launched on the PlayStation Vita on December 17, 2011 and is accessible via an icon on the LiveArea. There are four different versions of the PlayStation Store: Asia, Europe (including Oceania and the Middle East), Japan, and North America. Content may vary per country. There are no PlayStation Stores in China and Latin America.
PlayStation Store for PSP.
At the PlayStation Store's initial launch, PSP owners could only access the PSP section of the store by means of a PS3 connection. This meant that only PSP owners who also had a PS3 could access PSone games and other content available exclusively on the PlayStation Network. However, the PSP-oriented "PlayStation Store (PC)" launched in Asia on September 20, 2007 at the Tokyo Game Show and was accessible through supported internet browsers on Windows PCs. The PC store became available for the U.S. and Europe on November 20, 2007.
A year later on October 15, 2008, System Software 5.00 was released for the PSP. For the first time PSP owners could also access the store directly on their PSP consoles. Two weeks later on October 28, 2008, the PC store was relaunched, this time being able to be accessed via PSP Media Manager 3. Like with the PS3, PSP and PSone games downloaded from the PlayStation Store can only be used on up to 2 separate PSPs activated on the account the content was purchased by.
Media Go.
During E3 2009, Sony announced the release of "Media Go", a Windows application used to access, download and install games and software to a connected PSP, as well as Sony Walkman devices and Sony Ericsson cell phones. The software can also be used to manage and transfer other media such as music, videos and photos stored on the PSP and other compatible devices. Files are transferred to the PSP via a USB connection and saved onto a flash memory card (or internal flash storage on the PSPgo). The software was initially offered as an alternative to the already-existing PSP Media Manager (and the various other "Media Manager" applications for Sony devices) and can also be used to manage and transfer other media such as music, videos and photos stored on the PSP and other compatible devices. However, Sony soon completely replaced the "Media Manager" family of software with Media Go. It is only compatible with 32-bit versions of Windows XP and both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7.
PlayStation Network Downloader.
A DRM tool called the "PlayStation Network Downloader" is also required to download content from the PlayStation Store onto a PC. When downloading store content, an *.xpd file is first downloaded onto the user's computer and then opened by the PlayStation Network Downloader, which downloads the content directly to a PSP connected via a USB cable. This 'DRM' tool prevents the user from directly saving store contents onto their PC and illegally distributing the content. Currently, this software is also only compatible with certain Microsoft Windows operating systems.
PlayStation Store for PS4.
The PlayStation 4 version of the PlayStation Store was released on November 15th 2013 along with the console in North America, and on November 29th in most of Europe with the console two weeks following the North American launch. The PS4 version of the PS Store uses the same overall design and interface to its predecessor, the PlayStation 3's store, however, the color scheme has been altered to match that of the console's theme, changing from black to blue. Currently, the PlayStation 4's version of the Store is fairly limited in terms of games, as the console has recently launched and few games have been released. The movies section of the store, on the other hand, features all the movies available on the other PS platforms.
PlayStation Store for PC.
In January 2013, the PlayStation Store was made available via an Internet browser. Users can purchase content for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation Portable via the online store, then download it via their respective devices.
Availability.
PlayStation Store is currently only available in selected countries:

66th Air Base Wing

The 66th Air Base Wing (66 ABW) is an inactive United States Air Force unit. It was last assigned to the Air Force Materiel Command Electronic Systems Center, stationed at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts. It was inactivated on 30 September 2010.
History.
On 15 November 1952, the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was established at Shaw AFB, South Carolina, replacing the federalized Air National Guard 118 Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. The wing was activated on 1 January 1953. The 66th TRW commanded the functions of both the support groups as well as the flying 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Group and the squadrons assigned to it. The wing and squadrons trained at Shaw prior to deployment to NATO. The squadrons formed and activated were:
On 25 June 1953 the 66th TRW departed Shaw, being reassigned to Sembach Air Base West Germany. Just prior to the wing's deployment to NATO, the 303d TRS was reequipped with RF-80As.
Sembach Air Base.
Major General B. C. Struther, commander of Twelfth Air Force, welcomed the wing upon its arrival in Europe. The Wing Commander landed at 1509 hours in a T-33, bringing the remainder of the wing’s aircraft with him: 32 RF-80 Shooting Stars and 4 additional T-33s.
At Sembach, the 66th TRW had three operational squadrons: the 30th, 302d and 303d TRS. The 30th TRS flew the RB-26's, while the 302d and 303d flew the RF-80A.
On 30 November 1954, the 30th TRS received the first Martin RB-57A Canberras to replaced its World War II vintage RB-26s. However, engine malfunctions, structural deficiencies and lack of supporting equipment and parts plagued the RB-57A, and the wing soon began to replace them with RB-66s. In August 1955, the 302d and 303d TRS started to receive the Republic RF-84F Thunderflash.
On 1 January 1957 a fourth squadron, the 19th TRS was transferred from the 47th Bombardment Wing at RAF Sculthorpe to the 66th TRW. The 47th TRS flew the RB-45C Tornado, however the squadron remained at Sculthrope and did not physically transfer its assets to Sembach. At Sculthorpe, the 19th TRS transitioned to the Douglas RB-66 Destroyer aircraft.
As 1957 progressed USAFE HQ decided to reorganise its tactical reconnaissance assets. Both the 66th TRW and the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base were flying dissimilar types of aircraft: the RF-84F and the RB-66. This was counterproductive not only in terms of operational efficiency, but also in terms of maintenance and supply. On 6 December 1957 HQ, USAFE transferred the 19th and 30th TRS and their RB-66's to the 10th TRW. In return the 32d and 38th Tactical Fighter Squadrons at Phalsbourg AB, France were transferred from the 10th TRW which made the 66th TRW a four-squadron RF-84 wing. However due to space restrictions at Sembach, the 32d and 38th would remain in France, as a separate detachment of the 66th.
The 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was inactivated on 8 December 1957 when the group was considered redundant as part of the Air Force tri-deputate reorganization. All of its flying squadrons were assigned directly to the wing.
In January 1958, it was announced that the 66th TRW would transition to the McDonnell RF-101C Voodoo. However the poor flying weather of the German winter was causing an excessive amount of operational delays due to the inclement weather. The 66th was directed to utilise Nouasseur AB, Morocco to its limits in detachments of USAFE aircraft. At Nouasseur all training missions were accomplished as required. The very favourable North African weather provided the ideal environment in which new pilots could be transitioned on to the squadron aircraft in the minimum of time. In addition, the 66th TRW used Nouasseur to transition all its pilots onto the RF-101C aircraft.
In July 1958, following the inactivation of the 38th Bombardment Wing, the 66th TRW, was reassigned from Sembach to Laon-Couvron Air Base, France. This move was in accordance with USAFEs plan to realign the posture of various bases in anticipation of the 66th's pending aircraft conversion to the RF-101. Another reason for the move to France was the unsuitability of Sembach's runway, which was barely adequate for the RF-84, but absolutely unsuitable for the higher performance RF-101 aircraft
Laon Air Base.
On 10 July 1958, 66th TRW Wing Headquarters was transferred to Laon, however its flying squadrons (32d, 38th, 302d and 303d) were located at Phalsbourg AB until considerable runway improvements, in particular the preparation of runway overruns could be made at Laon.
Just prior to the move to France, in a public relations exercise, the 66th TRW engaged in some large-scale oblique photo coverage of all towns and cities within a 30-mile radius of Laon. The processed photos were presented to the various town and city officials as a means of introducing the newcomers to the community.
In early 1959 it was announced that the RF-84 equipped 302d and 303d TRS were to be inactivated and their places in the 66th taken by the RF-101-equipped 17th and 18th TRS from Shaw AFB, South Carolina. These two units arrived at Laon in May 1959, with the 302d and 303d inactivated on 20 June. All the RF-84s were ferried to the IRAN facility at Naples for eventual distribution to NATO forces.
In January 1959 the announcement was made that the 32d and 38th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons were to receive the McDonnell RF-101C "Voodoo". Many of the pilots of the 302d and 303d squadrons were transferred to the new Voodoo squadrons. These moves made the 66th TRW a four-squadron RF-101C wing.
Routine training operations were flown from Laon for over seven years. On 7 March 1966, French President Gen Charles De Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATO's military structure but not leave the political organization. He gave NATO forces one year (until 1 April 1967) to depart France.
However there was no space available in Germany to relocate the 66th TRW, so it was decided by HQ, USAF that the Strategic Air Command's standby base at RAF Upper Heyford, England, would be transferred to USAFE and the 66th TRW would be relocated to the UK from Laon AB.
The relocation of the 66th TFW was completed by November 1966. On 17 March 1967, the remaining USAF equipment and personnel were transferred out of Laon and the base was turned over to the French government.
RAF Upper Heyford.
After two years at Upper Heyford, in 1968 it was announced that the 66th TRW was to convert to the McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom II in the following year. On 27 March 1969, the first two Phantoms flew into Upper Heyford. and the 66th became a mixed reconnaissance force. The RF-101C's were assigned to the 18th TRS and were limited to the daylight role. The RF-4C's were assigned to the 17th TRS and were capable of an all weather day and night operation.
The advent of the RF-4C gave the 66th TRW a longer arm in terms of target access. In the event of a ‘hot’ war the longer reach of the wing’s aircraft would have made many previously inaccessible targets behind the iron curtain easily acquired from the bases in West Germany to which they would have been deployed.
The Phantoms did not stay for long, however, as in January 1970 the inactivation of the 66th TRW commenced. On 10 December 1969, Detachment 1, 20th Tactical Fighter Wing was established at RAF Upper Heyford as part of congressional budget cutbacks; a USAFE-wide base realignment/consolidation of units, as the 20th's base at RAF Wethersfield had a limited potential for development and was awkwardly close to the expanding London Stansted Airport. The relocation also served the need to reorganize the USAFE base structure after the French withdrawal from NATO and the eviction of non-French military forces from French soil.
As part of the budget reductions and to consolidate all of the wing's elements at a larger facility, the 20th Tactical Fighter Wing was relocated from RAF Wethersfield to Upper Heyford, replacing and absorbing the 66th TRW. The RF-4Cs of the 17th TRS were reassigned to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing at Zweibrücken Air Base in West Germany, and the RF-101Cs of the 18th TRS were reassigned to the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina.
Some support elements of the inactivated 66th TRW, primarily Civil Engineering, were reassigned to Wethersfield, being designated the 66th Combat Support Group. The group was again redesignated 66th Combat Support Squadron (CSS) and became the host unit at the station.
The 66th CSS performed whatever duties were necessary to keep the base in a usable, operational state. It was inactivated in 1976 when the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at RAF Alconbury assumed caretaker responsibilities at Wethersfield.
66th Electronic Combat Wing.
On 1 June 1985, the 66th was reactivated again at Sembach AB, West Germany as the 66th Electronic Combat Wing. The 66th ECW trained (43d ECS) Lockheed EC-130 Hercules aircrews at Sembach in the Compass Call mission; administratively controlled (42d ECS) General Dynamics/Grumman EF-111A Raven aircrews based at RAF Upper Heyford, England, and acted as a command and control coordination function for the 52nd FW F-4G & F-16C/D Wild Weasel SAM suppression (SEAD) mission. The 66th provided tactical and electronic combat operations during Operation Desert Storm.
The 66th ECW was inactivated on 31 March 1992
Modern era.
In 1994, the 66th Air Base Wing was designated as the host unit at Hanscom AFB, MA. It was a non-flying wing with a mission to support the numerous organizations assigned to the base.
The 66th ABW supported the Electronic Systems Center and provides host base services to over 3,000 active duty, Reserve and National Guard military personnel and DoD civilians who work and live at Hanscom Air Force Base. Additionally, the 66 ABW supports over 100,000 retired military personnel, annuitants and spouses living in the seven-state New England area.
On 26 March 2010 the wing commander, Colonel David “Iron” Orr, was relieved of his position by Lieutenant General Ted Bowlds, commander of the Electronic Systems Center. Bowlds found that Orr had held an unprofessional relationship with a subordinate female lieutenant colonel and had exhibited undue favoritism to the officer with regards to a promotion recommendation.
In 2010, ESC reverted to an organization of program offices and the 38th Engineering Installation Wing (by then a group) was reassigned. New Air Force standards caused the 66th Air Base Wing, because of its size to be inactivated and replaced by the 66th Air Base Group on 30 September.

Po Pimp

"Po Pimp" is the debut single by Do or Die, it served as the lead single from their debut album, "Picture This". The song was produced by The Legendary Traxster and featured a guest verse from fellow Chicago rapper Twista and vocals from R&B singer Johnny P.
Background.
"Po Pimp" was originally released independently in the group's native Chicago. The song became a local hit and caught the attention of prominent Houston-based hip hop label Rap-a-Lot Records, who signed the trio to a record deal. Rap-a-Lot then released "Po Pimp" nationwide in the summer of 1996 and it quickly became a breakthrough hit for the trio. It peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 on October 19 and also reached No. 1 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. By the end of 1996, "Po Pimp" had become one of the most popular and best selling singles of the year, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the single gold for sales of over 500,000 copies and it made it to Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 Singles of 1996 at No. 91.
This song, later, had 4 sequels: "Still Po Pimpin" from "Headz Or Tailz", "Sex Appeal" from "Back 2 Tha Game" and "Do U?" from "Pimpin Ain't Dead", the 4th sequel is on "Category F5" by Twista called "Yo Body"

<doc id="9783883" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9783883" title="Vars, Ontario">
Vars, Ontario

Vars is a small village in eastern Ontario, Canada, located within the municipal boundaries of Ottawa. The current population (2004) is approximately 1000 people, up about 250 people from 2000
Facilities.
Vars has a French elementary school called St-Guillaume, two churches (one Anglican and one Roman Catholic), and an outdoor skating rink located in the "Alcide Trudeau Park". There are few businesses, but there is a corner store, a pizzeria and other small businesses. The town's fire station, Ottawa Fire Service's Station 73, was relocated and rebuilt in 2007 and is now located at the south end of Frank Kenny Road. The local softball teams for children and teenagers, the Vars Vipers and the Vars Vikings, are sponsored by local businesses.
History.
The Bearbrook area was first colonized in 1824. By 1836 a small settlement began to form. The brook originally got its name from the plentiful amount of bears that foraged on acorns produced from the large quantities of oaks found alongside its sides. Mr. Dunning set up a sawmill operation that used logs that had been channelled down through Bear Brook, and which continued on eastward to the South Nation River, the Ottawa river and finally to the St. Lawrence Seaway. Bear Brook now flows with less than half the water it did when settlers first arrived. By the time the mill was set up the town consisted of a hotel, many stores and approximately 200 people in which the vast majority were francophone. In 1881, a train station was built and the area was named Bearbrook Station which would help transport logs towards the St. Lawrence. In 1886, the community reached a large enough population to gain a post office which lightened the work load for Jack Young who had previously brought the mail in by horse and by snowshoe in winter.
Bearbrook Station was difficult to distinguish from the nearby community of Bearbrook; therefore, it was renamed. There are two stories for how Vars actually got its name. The first, is that with the building of the new post office, the people of Bearbrook Station decided to name the community after the four people who brought the post office to the area: Mc(V)eigh, (A)rmstrong, (R)onan, and (S)mith. The second story is that the town was given the name by a retired priest from Embrun, Abbé C. Guillame, in memory of the village of Vars, Hautes-Alpes, in France.
In 1915, permanent sidewalks were built in the main community area. In 1931, the village streets were lit up by street lights, one year earlier than the neighbouring village of Cumberland.

Hotel Dieu Hospital (Kingston, Ontario)

Hotel Dieu Hospital is a hospital in Kingston, Ontario. It is affiliated with Queen's University, and is a partner within Kingston's university hospitals, delivering health care, conducting research and training the health care professionals. 
History.
In 1841 the Catholic bishop of Kingston, Remigius Gaulin, asked the Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph (RHSJ) of Montreal to send a group of sisters to establish a Catholic Hospital in his city to provide care for the poor Irish Catholic immigrants in the city. The RHSJs, however, were unable to find suitable buildings for their hospital until 1845. On September 2, 1845, Mother Amable Bourbonniere along with Sisters Huguette Claire Latour, Emilie Barbarie, and Louise Davignon, accompanied by their benefactress, Miss Josephine Perras and Mr. Laframboise, a friend of the community, arrived in Kingston. They stayed with the Kingston Notre Dame Sisters for two days, and then moved into their hospital, located in a small limestone building, now 229 Brock St., on September 4, 1845. The Kingston RHSJs saw their first patient on September 7th. By the end of October, they had refurbished and moved into their monastery, located at 233 Brock St., allowing them to have a men's ward on the main floor of the Hospital and a women's ward on the second floor. 
In 1892, the hospital was moved to its present location on Sydenham Street, which formerly housed Regiopolis College. In 1846 Alexander Macdonell (bishop) established Regiopolis College, which offered academic and theological training to Roman Catholic youth. The original building is now part of the Hotel Dieu Hospital. 
The main wing of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the Jeanne Mance Wing, completed in 1984, is named for a woman sent by the RHSJ to New France in 1641. Jeanne Mance, a lay woman, was given the responsibility of founding a hospital and caring for the sick in New France. In 1642, she arrived in what is now Montreal and founded the first Hotel Dieu Hospital in 1645.
Services.
Urgent Care Walk In Clinic.
It is the urgent care centre for Kingston. All patients who are ambulatory and who are experiencing minor illness or injuries that that cannot wait for a family doctor are directed to attend this clinic. The clinic is open from 8 am – 8 pm, 365 days/year.

<doc id="9783914" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9783914" title="GeneCalling">
GeneCalling

GeneCalling is a mRNA profiling technology finding increased use in the field of genomics and invented by Dr. Jonathan M. Rothberg and developed by "CuraGen" Corporation. This genomics technique rapidly identifies candidate genes for use in drug discovery and development. Differences between gene expression in healthy tissues and disease or drug responsive tissues are examined and compared in this technology. Novel genes in any organism - most commonly humans, animals, plants and pathogens - as well as known ones, can be detected by this open expression system.
History.
On February 17, 1999 "CuraGen" was granted a patent covering its open architecture system of gene expression technology. The patent was entitled "Method and Apparatus for Identifying, Classifying, or Qualifying DNA Sequences in a Sample Without Sequencing," and covered the newly developed GeneCalling process. While most methods of analyzing gene expression to this point were closed systems such as ChIP, the open nature of this system was groundbreaking in its provision of greater flexibility through analysis of gene expression without prior sequence information as well as the ability to compare these results to a sequence database.
Methodology of GeneCalling.
The steps and methodology involved in GeneCalling are illustrated in figure 1. First, mRNAs are isolated from a given sample and processed into fragments for analysis. This usually involves the synthesis and subdivision of double-stranded cDNAs from polyA RNA. Distinct sets of restriction enzymes can then be used to digest sets of the divided cDNAs and resulting fragments ligated to labelled adapters to be amplified by PCR. PCR products are then purified and subjected to gel electrophoresis on a mounted platform employing stationary laser excitation and a multi-colour charge-coupled device imaging system. A fluorescent label at the 5' end of one of the PCR primers allows for visualization of the PCR fragments, and the cDNAs are subjected to several isolated and identical restriction digests to generate a merged profile based on peak height and variance. The merged digestion profiles from the cDNA preparations are then compared to locate differentially expressed fragments (such as between normal tissue and diseased or drug responsive tissue); these profiles are compared by means of various internet-ready databases such as GeneScape.
Advantages and Benefits.
The GeneCalling process is robust and efficient. It is well validated and requires only minimal sized samples. Furthermore, it is widespread in its scope, identifying nearly all genes in a given area of research. Beyond this, it identifies subtle changes in gene expression while maintaining reproducibility. Because it is an open expression system, no prior knowledge of sequence information is required, and the ability to share information obtained through databases allows for a complete analysis of gene and protein function.
Means of Discovery.
According to "CuraGen", GeneCalling permits scientists and researchers to make advances and breakthroughs by the following means:
• Systematically identify new and infrequently expressed genes - In the development of new therapies, such genes may serve as potential targets.
• Identify genes important in disease and drug response - With the identification of novel genes, measurement of gene activity in the context of disease or drug response can be performed and compared.
• Comparison of newly identified genes across a number of species by use of comparative genomics - A better understanding of gene function can be obtained through a comparison across model organisms and other species.
• Clarification of gene pathways - Newly identified genes are associated with specific proteins and biological pathways.
• Differentiate small changes in gene expression - A biological response to drug treatment involves critical early stage genes that can be identified.
• Information sharing - GeneCalling data can link to various databases and allow for the updating of gene lists.
Relevance/Function.
Several peer reviewed journals have published articles with results from GeneCalling applications in human cells as well as other systems. This technique is also finding relevant application in several emerging fields of genomics including pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics, and pharmacogenetics. GeneCalling applications have led to: identification of markers of efficacy and toxicity for pharmaceutical compounds, the location of human versions of differentially expressed genes, identification of genetic variations (cSNPs), evaluation of numerous drug candidates, and discovery of potential novel therapeutics.

1995 Rijeka bombing

The 1995 Rijeka bombing occurred on 20 October 1995 in Rijeka, Croatia, when an Islamic terrorist organization attempted to destroy a police station by driving a car with a bomb into the wall of the building. Twenty-seven employees in the police station and two bystanders on the street were injured, although the only person killed was the attacker.
Cause.
In the last days of the Bosnian War, Bosnian Croat military forces (the Croatian Defense Council, HVO) captured Talaat Fouad Qasim when he attempted to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina. Qasim, an important member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, was soon transferred to Egypt with the active help of Croatia. Because of that and because Croatia had de facto controlled the Croatian Defence Council, the military organization which had captured Talaat Fouad Qasim, a decision was made to commit a terrorist attack in Croatia.
The attack.
At 11:21 a.m. Central European Time, a Fiat 131 Mirafiori entered the parking lot of the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County police headquarters. Due to the 90-degree turn needed to enter the lot, the vehicle moved slowly. Near the entrance, the driver did not park in the parking spaces for civilians, but instead started to accelerate towards the wall at the end of the parking lot. Due to the low security measures, this incident was not noticed before the attack itself took place. After 15-20 meters, passing 8-10 available parking spaces in the small lot, the Fiat crashed into the stairs leading to the police station and exploded. The time of explosion was recorded as 11:22 a.m. local time (10:22 AM UTC). Subsequently, a police investigation found out the car was loaded with of highly-explosive TNT. The police also found a part of a Canadian passport inside the remains of the attacker's car. The next day, representatives of the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya terrorist organization from Egypt claimed responsibility for the attack, requesting extradition of Qasim.
Due to an error made by the attackers, the bombing did not cause fatalities, aside from the suicide bomber himself. The police headquarters is located on a higher ground than the parking lot itself, requiring the stairs in the first place. The other apparent miscalculation involved the size of the parking lot, where the Fiat 131 had neither the space and velocity, nor the horsepower, to climb the stairs and destroy the police station wall. As a result, the police station failed to collapse and only 29 injuries were recorded (including two unaware bystanders). The bomb also carved a large crater in the ground, battering nearby buildings and destroying vehicles.
Aftermath.
With the help of the CIA, officials examined the video footage of the attack. American and Croatian investigative sources came to the conclusion that Hassan al-Sharif Mahmud Saad had organized this attack. Saad had come to live in Bosnia only that year; previously, he had been living in Italy. Soon after the attack, Bosnian officials discovered that Saad was planning a new terrorist attack, against NATO forces, which was to happen in December 1995. A few days after that attack failed, he was killed in central Bosnia in a firefight with Croatian Defense Council forces.

UFO (satellite)

The Ultra High Frequency Follow-On (UFO) system is a United States Department of Defense (DOD) program sponsored and operated by the U.S. Navy to provide communications for airborne, ship, submarine and ground forces. The UFO constellation replaced the U.S. DOD Fleet Satellite Communications System (FLTSATCOM) constellation and will consist of eleven satellites. The ground terminal segment consists of equipment and resident personnel at existing satellite communication stations. The spacecraft are controlled by the Naval Satellite Operations Center (NAVSOC) located at the Naval Base Ventura County, Point Mugu, CA.
The UHF satellites will primarily serve tactical users. UFO provides almost twice as many channels as FLTSATCOM and has about 10 percent more power per channel. The EHF package on satellites four through eleven have an Earth coverage beam and a steerable five-degree spot beam that enhances its tactical use. The EHF capability also allows the UFO network to connect to the strategic Milstar system. Satellites eight, nine and ten also carry a Global Broadcast System in the Ka-Band.
First launch of the UFO took place on 25 March 1993, with constellation completion dependent on replacement needs for the aging FLTSATCOM constellation. The Atlas II is the current launch vehicle of choice; however, space shuttle compatibility will exist. The UFO bus and payload weigh 2,300 pounds (1.04 tonne). The solar array spans 60.5 feet (18.4 m) and produce 2,500 watts at the end of the planned 14-year lifetime.
The UHF system supports stationary and mobile users including manportable, ships, submarines, aircraft and other mobile terminals. The UFO Follow-on system is schedule for replacement by the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS).

WallStreet Tower Omaha

The WallStreet Tower Omaha was a planned 32-story, condominium project that would have become Omaha, Nebraska's third-tallest building upon completion. The building was to be built on the site of the former Union Pacific headquarters, located at 14th and Dodge Street. Prices for a unit were to range from $195,000 to $620,000. The project was expected to be completed by fall 2009 and called for the erection of a 32-floor building with 192 condominiums. The proposal was then reduced to 96 condos while maintaining the same number of floors, before plans were scrapped all together. Hyatt had committed to using 153 rooms on six floors for a Hyatt Place brand hotel. Hyatt instead constructed a stand-alone, nine-story "Hyatt Place" in the Old Market. For aesthetic purposes, the city of Omaha made the developer fill in the failed construction site before the 2011 College World Series, which was the first year the series began being hosted downtown in TD Ameritrade Park.

Monument to the Heroes of the Military Engineers' Army

The Monument to the Heroes of the Military Engineers' Army (; often called "Leul" - "the Lion") in Bucharest, Romania is dedicated to the heroism and sacrifice of the military engineers who fought in the Romanian Army during World War I, of whom nearly a thousand were killed in action and many more wounded.
Unveiled in June 1929, it is located at the intersection of Bulevardul Geniului and Bulevardul Iuliu Maniu, across the street from Cotroceni Palace. One of Bucharest's most recognisable monuments, it was financed entirely through donations from veteran officers of the Military Engineers' Army and executed by Spiridon Georgescu.
Set into the pyramidal base are bronze reliefs depicting the engineers in action. Four life-sized bronze statues represent troops from the Military Engineers' Army — a sapper, a pontoon bridge builder, a Signal Corps engineer and a Căile Ferate Române soldier.
But the monument's chief component is a statue of a lion, which stands atop the pedestal. With his front paws he tramples upon the barrel of a cannon (upon which sits a "Pickelhaube"); a flag flows downward. The lion symbolises the endurance, daring and bravery shown by Romanian troops between 1916 and 1918, especially at the dramatic battles during the summer of 1917 — Mărăşti, Oituz and Mărăşeşti.
Carved into the pedestal in relief is the inscription, ""Spuneți generațiilor viitoare că noi am făcut suprema jertfă pe câmpurile de bătaie pentru întregirea neamului"" - "Tell succeeding generations that we made the supreme sacrifice on the fields of battle for the union of the people". A medallion on the steps at the bottom reads, "EROILOR DIN ARMA GENIULUI 1916-1919" - "To the heroes of the Military Engineers' Army 1916-1919".

In 1954, Philips Analytical introduced the PW1520 XRF spectrometer, forming the basis for commercial X-ray fluorescence products for elemental analysis. That same year, Philips introduced the PW1050 goniometer (θ-2θ geometry) for both diffraction and fluorescence products. The PW1050 goniometer remains at the heart of many diffractometers still in use today. In 1972 the headquarters and system development were relocated from Eindhoven to Almelo. Over the next several decades, Philips expanded their product line under the Philips Analytical brand before the division's sale to Spectris in 2002. Prior to the Spectris acquisition, PANalytical sold their photoluminescence mapping product line based in Waterloo, Canada to Accent Optical Technologies.
The PANalytical organization is set up covering the following regions: Asia Pacific (HQ in Singapore), AMEC (HQ in Westborough, MA, USA) and EMEA (HQ in Almelo, The Netherlands). The company's current product line includes diffraction and fluorescence systems (energy- and wavelength dispersive) for materials science applications and process control.

Ermengol VII, Count of Urgell

Ermengol VII (or Armengol VII) (died 1184) was the Count of Urgell from 1154 to his death. He was called "el de Valencia".
The son of Ermengol VI and his first wife, Arsenda of Cabrera, in 1157, Ermengol VII married Dulce, daughter of Roger III of Foix and Jimena de Osona, who acted as his regent during his absences in Castile. Without any possibility of expansion into surrounding territory, Ermengol was attracted to the Castilian possessions that he inherited from his grandmother. Thus, a major part of his reign was spent in the vassalage of Ferdinand II of León, to whom he was majordomo and tenant of many castles in Extremadura.
Around 1166, he founded the canons of Bellpuig de les Avellanes. In 1163, he granted a charter to the people of Agramunt and in 1174 to Balaguer. In 1164, he coined his own comital currency in Agramunt.
He died at Requena and left Urgell to his son Ermengol VIII. He also left a daughter, Marquesa, who married Ponç II of Cabrera in 1194.

Fleet Satellite Communications System

FLTSATCOM (also FLTSAT) was a satellite communication system of the U.S. Navy which was used for UHF radio communications between ships, submarines, airplanes and ground stations of the Navy.
Most of the transponders on these satellites were simple repeaters with no authentication or control over what they retransmitted. This characteristic led to a subculture of radio pirates in Brazil using modified ham radio equipment to use the satellites without authorization.
Altogether eight satellites were launched from 1978 to 1989 by Atlas-Centaur rockets into geostationary orbit. The system became operational in 1981. The satellites were manufactured by TRW. The solar arrays of the satellites had a span of over 13.2 m. A special characteristic was an UHF transmit antenna reflector 4.9 m in diameter. The satellites had 12 transponders, which worked in the UHF range from 240 - 400 megahertz. Additionally FLTSATCOM 7 and 8 had an experimental EHF transponder built by Lincoln Laboratory intended to test the MILSTAR ground terminals. The first seven satellites had a launch mass of 1884 kg and the remaining two were 2310 kg, with the additional mass due to the EHF payload module.
The fifth satellite reached geosynchronous orbit, but was unusable due to damage to the solar arrays and antennas. The failure was attributed to explosive delamination of the fiberglass honeycomb fairing during flight. The inside wall of the fairing extensively damaged one of the solar arrays, and bent the transmit antenna mast which prevented the antenna from deploying fully. 
Flight 7 was launched out of sequence after a launch failure of a Delta mission carrying the GOES-G weather satellite grounded the entire US launch fleet weeks prior to the scheduled launch of F-6. By the time the Delta mishap investigation concluded there was no risk to the Atlas-Centaur system, F-7 was ready to launch and the system managers elected to swap missions to avoid delaying EHF system testing.
Flight 6 was destroyed in one of the US space program's more notorious accidents. The Atlas-Centaur was launched on March 26, 1987 into a pouring Florida thunderstorm. At about 30 seconds into the flight, the Atlas was struck by lightning and the resulting static discharge sent an erroneous signal to the guidance computer, causing it to pitch over and break apart from structural stress. The booster exploded and showered burning debris onto LC-36B, which was barely visible through the heavy rain. As a result of this easily preventable disaster, NASA issued strict weather guidelines for all launches.
In the late 1990s, FLTSATCOM satellites were gradually replaced by the UFO satellites. FLTSAT flights 7 and 8 continue to provide UHF communications.

The Entertainment at Althorp

The Entertainment at Althorp, or The Althorp Entertainment, is an early Jacobean era literary work, written by Ben Jonson. It is also known by the alternative title The Satyr. The work marked a major development in Jonson's career, as the first of many entertainments and masques that he would write for the Stuart Court.
The entertainment was designed to welcome the members of the new royal family to England during their progress from Edinburgh to London. It was performed on 25 June 1603, before the new queen consort, Anne of Denmark, and her son Prince Henry, at Althorp, the Northamptonshire estate of the Spencer family. (The then-head of the family, Sir Robert Spencer, was created 1st Baron Spencer of Wormleighton less than a month later, on 21 July 1603.) The main speaker in the entertainment is a satyr, yielding the alternative title, and the cast includes fairies and elves — a blending of figures from both classical and native English folklore that Jonson would employ in future works as well (see, for example, "The Fortunate Isles and Their Union" of 1625). The new queen is personified as Queen Mab.
Under its full title, "A Particular Entertainment of the Queen and Prince their Highness at Althorp," the work was entered into the Stationers' Register on 19 March 1604, and was published later that year in a quarto that also included Jonson's "The Coronation Triumph." The quarto was printed by Valentine Simmes for the bookseller Edward Blount. The entertainment was reprinted in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616, and was thereafter included in the collected works.
Jonson's attempt to win royal favor during the previous reign had not succeeded: his play "Cynthia's Revels" was poorly received when acted at Court in 1601, and he gained no preferment from Queen Elizabeth. Jonson fared much better in the new reign: he wrote several entertainments in the early Jacobean era, and in 1605 his first Court masque, "The Masque of Blackness," was staged at Whitehall Palace. From then till "Chloridia" in 1631, Jonson was the most regularly employed masque writer for the Stuarts. He produced a major segment of his total literary output for their court, and received a large share of his income from those works.

The new Bishop of Hyderabad was consecrated March 25, 2000 by Archbishop Simeon Anthony Pereira of Karachi in the presence of the papal nuncio to Pakistan. An apostolic letter from Pope John Paul II was read before the ordination.
He was one of the 6 delegates from the Pakistani Church participating in the Asia Mission Congress in Chang Mai, Thailand from October 18–22, 2006.
The Bishop has been at the forefront of encouraging pastoral work that is revolutionizing attitudes towards women. The Diocese pastoral teams have changed the way that people think, and uplifted the status of women – women were seen as chattel, they had never sent girls to school as they didn’t see the value in educating them, but now they send them to school as well.

Mount Saint Joseph Academy (Buffalo, New York)

Mount Saint Joseph Academy (MSJA) was a Roman Catholic school located in Buffalo, New York. It closed at the end of the 2009–10 school year.
History.
Mount Saint Joseph Academy was founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1891 as a K–12 boarding school for girls. In the 1970s MSJA began admitting boys, becoming a coeducational institution. In 1987, the high school portion of MSJA was closed due to declining enrollment. This did not solve MSJA's financial difficulties, and in 2005 the Sisters of St. Joseph announced that they would be closing the school. Parents, however, organized the Committee to Save M.S.J.A., and successfully reestablished MSJA as an independent Catholic school offering classes for pre-K to eighth grade students. For the 2007–8 school year, MSJA moved from the Canisius College campus to the former site of Central Presbyterian Church (Buffalo, New York) at 15 Jewett Parkway (northwest corner of Jewett Ave. and Main Street). Mounting operational difficulties and continuing declines in enrollment—from 125 students at the time of the move in 2007–8 to 88 students in 2009-10—led to closure of the school after the 2009-10 school year.
The final site of MSJA was in Buffalo's Parkside Neighborhood, a short walk from Frank Lloyd Wright's historic Darwin Martin House, and less than a half-mile from Frederick Law Olmsted's Delaware Park.

<doc id="9784211" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9784211" title="Goblins in modern fiction">
Goblins in modern fiction

Two major branches of goblins exist in popular fiction, including fantasy settings. Alongside J. R. R. Tolkien's descriptions of Orcs, the older branch is inherently evil and malicious, with varying coloring and generally matted and filthy hair. This type of goblin appears in "Dungeons & Dragons". The distinctive green-skinned, hairless, capricious, and generally amoral (rather than absolutely evil) goblins created for "Warhammer" are direct progenitors of goblins in more modern games, such as those in the Warcraft Universe or "".
"Spider-Man".
"Main Articles: Green Goblin, Hobgoblin (comics), Harry Osborn, Normie Osborn, Spider-Man (2002 film) & Spider-Man 3"
There are many villains in the Spider-Man notably Green Goblin, Hobgoblin, New Goblin, etc. Green Goblin and New Goblin already appeared in two films.
"Artemis Fowl Book Series".
Goblins are fairies that are considered very stupid by other races. They are able to conjure fireballs (as Foaly points out, giving this power to such unintelligent creatures amounts to one of evolution's nasty tricks) and their skin is fireproof. Goblins are lucky if they can make friends, as they cannot cooperate with others. A group of them create the B'wa Kell, a triad group that smuggles batteries for weaponry and started a rebellion that nearly destroyed Haven, the capital of the fairy people.
"Final Fantasy".
In the "Final Fantasy" series of RPGs, goblins are synonymous with imps. In the earlier episodes of the series, they typically appear as the weakest enemy in the game. They are depicted as being small and skinny with browinish skin and pointy ears and nearly always wearing a stocking cap, owing more in appearance to a Scottish redcap than a Tolkien-style goblin. They also occasionally appear as a low level summoned creature. In "Final Fantasy XI", they appear as one of the more intelligent species of "Beastmen", occasionally living as merchants in cities and interacting with the people there. The more hostile Goblins are also known as some of the most annoying enemies in the game, frequently appearing at high levels in popular leveling zones, much to the chagrin of campers who must constantly avoid them.
"Everquest".
In the MMORPG "Everquest 2", goblins are portrayed as largely mischievous, primitive, fairly foolish creatures. Small and green, with large pointy ears and yellow eyes, they tend to look and sound as silly as they act. "Gigglegibber" Goblins run a series of gambling games throughout "Norrath". Upon visiting their hideout during the 'Frostfell' season (Christmas 2005 special quest) it is revealed that in addition to this gambling game they are also attempting to - unsuccessfully - forge gold coins, and yet they have no intention spending any of this money, they simply wish to 'have' it. Most of their schemes are harmless, though often illegal. Not all goblins of "Norrath" are so benign, however, with some being evil, and even falling under the control of external dark magic.
"Harry Potter".
Goblins in "Harry Potter" are short, ugly creatures. Unlike many other depictions of goblins, they do not seem to be stupid, but rather sly. Goblins tend to like money, and in fact run Gringotts, the Wizard bank. They are also known to be very good at making magical objects, similar to dwarves in other traditions, and can recognise true goblin made items. The morality of goblins has not been explored in detail; while they do not seem evil in nature, they are often sly, cruel and troublesome, and have staged numerous rebellions throughout Wizarding history, often as a result of persecution, like other non-human creatures they are banned from carrying a wand. They believe the true owner of an item is the maker, not the buyer, and are dangerous to cross.
"Mabinogi".
In the MMORPG Mabinogi, there is a non-playable (except in events) race known as goblins. They are not an evil race by nature, but most seen in the course of the story and game are controlled by the evil magic of the Fomors. There are a small few that are communicable, though.
"Magic: the Gathering".
In the collectible trading card game, "", goblins are a very popular and potent creature type. They tend to be red aligned creatures that come in large numbers, love rocks and have little to no sense of self-preservation. Most have low power and toughness. They are often a source of humour within the game (for example, the flavour text of the spell Shock reads "I love lightning! It’s my best invention since the rock", attributed to the goblin weaponsmith Toggo). Their popularity and effectiveness is such that they have received more attention at the cost of other red flavoured creatures, such as dwarves and orcs.
Though there is one generally accepted form of Goblin (see above) there have been many other breeds featured in the game; examples include the brutish , intelligent , mischievous , mechanically inclined , and sensationalist goblins of . In Shards of Alara, goblins are ratlike creatures so frequently devoured by the dragons and other monsters of their homeland of Jund that they consider it their religious duty to be eaten. In the Zendikar expansion, the goblins, like many of the other races, are treasure hunters. In and Return to Ravnica, goblins are a significant minority of the population of the city-plane, and are found in a wide range of jobs and settings, including itinerant warriors and muscle for the chaotic Gruul and Rakdos clans and low-level wizards and wizards' assistants for the Izzet League.
"Palladium".
In the Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game, goblins are a race of faeries who have lost much of their native magic. Only a few, known as Cobblers, retain any magic. The vast majority of goblins are stupid, cruel, and lazy thieves.
"Ragnarok Online".
In the Ragnarok Online world, goblins wield different masks and have different elemental alignments among them (but they retain their Demi-Human race condition). Each mask can be dropped by a different one when they are killed, but Archer, Panzer and Steamrider Goblins do not drop any.
"RuneScape".
In the MMORPG "RuneScape", most of the goblins that the humans of RuneScape are familiar with are those goblins that cover the surface of the world. They worship a war god named Bandos but goblins call him "Big High War God". There are few places goblins cannot be found, but there are also few goblins that could not be described as stupid. The Dorgeshuun tribe of goblins are the notable exception to this, as they have been separated from the main goblin race since the times of the God wars. The Dorgeshuun have since then been hiding themselves away in their underground city, Dorgesh-Kaan. 
Were it not for their remarkable stupidity, the common goblins of the surface could cause extreme problems for the human civilisations. The Dorgeshuun, who are nowhere close to as stupid or inclined to bickering as normal goblins, are opposed to violence of all forms. They do not trust humans, though, and it is a rare human that has seen their mines or had anything approaching a decent conversation with them. The H.A.M (Humans Against Monsters) cult seem to target the goblins more than others. However, one plan to flood the underground city beneath Lumbridge castle failed, and the leader, Sigmund, is later on killed.
"The Elder Scrolls".
Throughout the franchise, including the 2006 "Oblivion", goblins have been used as an NPC class of monsters. The goblins featured in Oblivion are semisentient, diminutive pale greenskined barbarians. They range in power from the weak and cowardly "peon" goblins to the mighty goblin warlords. Also found in game are several goblin "tribes." Each tribe has a totem, and will go to war with other tribes to take their totem, or to reclaim their own. Goblins who are members of a tribe will attack goblins of other tribes, but will ignore non-tribal goblins.
In the "Tribunal" expansion for "The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind," it was revealed that High Elves used goblins to build slave armies. The Neravarine fought one such army in the sewers of Mournhold.
"The Grey Griffin" books.
In The Revenge of the Shadow King, the first book in The Grey Griffin books, goblins are dark faeries who make up the Shadow Kings Armies. They are divided into sub-species, the most dangerous being the Slayer Goblin.
"Warcraft".
In the Warcraft Universe, goblins are a green-skinned, diminutive, crafty race; known for their occasionally explosive, but usually effective engineering. They also tend to be a neutral party between the Alliance and Horde factions of Azeroth. Motivated almost entirely by greed, it is very likely that the only reason goblins remain neutral in the ongoing conflict is that if they chose a side, they would be unable to profit from the other. In , a faction of goblins independent from the ones already present in the game will become a playable race on the Horde.
Goblins are usually merchants, but there were two playable neutral goblin heroes in The Frozen Throne, the expansion to Warcraft III.

2MAX

2MAX FM is a community radio station based in Narrabri, NSW, Australia. The station has been broadcasting for over 15 years to the regional area after being granted a full-time licence in 2000.
2MAX FM can be heard in Narrabri, Wee Waa, Coonabaraban, Gunnedah, Moree and throughout the Narrabri Shire, broadcasting 10 KWatts from the top of Mount Dowe.
Mission statement.
"To involve, and be involved within, our community to provide excellent service and programmes"
Codes of Practice.
The station is subject to the Community Broadcasting Codes of Practice, as updated in 2009. The station was investigated for reported failure to allow Community Participation in Operations and Decision making. No breaches were found.
Programming.
The majority of music played on the station is country, however there is a variety of genres including Folk, Rock & Pop, Classical, 50's 60's 70's 80' & 90's and Christian/Religious. This is what the community surveyed wants to hear. The station provides an easy to access outlet for Australian music artists.
The majority of presenters are over 55 and are volunteers.
A Program committee governs the programmes that are put to air. Community radio is focussed on giving people a local voice, especially those who would not normally get access to the airtime.
This may include ethnic language programs, programs for the print handicapped, programming for gay and lesbian members, Youth programs or niche music. In rural areas such as Narrabri, this is made much more difficult, as censorship and conservatism is the norm.
A recent addition to programming is the "Max FM Mornings" program. Between the hours of 9am-12noon presents information on the local community, including Bush Bargains, school news, Narrabri Shire Council Report by the Mayor, a local weeds report, and a What's On In Our Shire report.
History.
2MAX FM began life as an aspirant community radio station known as Narrabri Shire Community Radio (NSCR). A small group of locals wanted a local radio station, and had discovered that there were community licences available. A public meeting was held, and a steering committee was formed.
The first test broadcast was from the Old Shire Council building, running at approx. 5 watts from a small antenna hung out the office window! The test broadcaster lasted a week, but was largely ignored by the Narrabri community.
A series of test broadcasts continued during the 90's. Another community aspirant group raised its head in the late 90's forcing NSCR into frequency sharing on a turn about basis.
The lack of financial support from the local community was exacerbated by this. Many business houses took wait and see approach.
The full-time licence was finally granted in 2000 - when then President Terry Hogan received the phone call, he was amazed at the lack of celebration. It was simply business as usual in Narrabri. The launching of MAX FM, coupled with a far more aggressive sales team lead to some limited acceptance by the local community.
A focus on the oldest members of the community seemed to be the right niche for MAX FM, with income, membership and technical growth was substantial.
Income.
The station earns income from memberships, sponsorships, fundraising, and grants, which totals approximately $140,000 per year.

Youth politics

Youth politics is a category of issues which distinctly involve, affect or otherwise impact youth.
History.
USA.
With roots in the early youth activism of the Newsboys and Mother Jones' child labor protests at the turn of the 20th century, youth politics were first identified in American politics with the formation of the American Youth Congress in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 60s organizations such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Students for a Democratic Society were closely associated with youth politics, despite the broad social statements of documents including the liberal Port Huron Statement and the conservative Sharon Statement and leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.. Other late-period figures associated with youth politics include Tom Hayden, Marian Wright Edelman and Bill Clinton.
Europe.
Youth politics have an extensive history in Europe, as well. Free German Youth was founded in 1936 as a communist alternative to the Nazi Youth movement.
In the UK there is a strong youth politics movement, consisting primarily of the British Youth Council, the UK Youth Parliament and the Scottish Youth Parliament. Although they have no direct power, the young people in these organisations have a close working relationship with Members of Parliament and are fairly influential, albeit ineffectual at bringing about direct change or tangible objectives.
Globally.
Other continents have experienced a variety of youth politics and political movements.
Mexico:
In the recent Mexico’s presidential election another manifestation of how the youth take the politics in the actual world were see, the students movement called “Yo soy 132” made a very notable change in how the elections developed, showing proofs of the electoral fraud they thought will happen, they changed the percentage of acceptation of the PRI candidate, Enrique Peña Nieto and they achieved to decrease it around 12 percentage points between the highest poll results for the candidate and the final results of the elections.
Present.
Between the influence of mainstream media and politicians, youth politics in the United States has been illegitimated and deprioritized. Organizations such as National Youth Rights Association and The Freechild Project continue to advocate and educate for issues that affect young people specifically, while other organizations, including Youth Service America and Advocates for Youth work for issues that affect youth directly. The children's rights movement is widely credited with keeping youth politics on the national radar, while other fledgling movements such as youth voice and youth participation have yet to gain the spotlight.Even with the efforts of these organizations, many college students do not see politics as an important part of their lives. Only 33% of college freshman think being knowledgeable about politics to be important. Data collected in by the National Center for Education Statistics found that overall young Americans care more about entertainment and sports than political and foreign news. Despite these statistics there is a positive outlook on youth involvement in the future because of the 2008 election when President Barack Obama ran.

Canada's National History Society

Canada's National History Society is a Canadian Winnipeg-based charitable organization founded in 1994 by the Hudson's Bay Company for the purpose of promoting greater popular interest in Canadian history principally through its publishing activities and outreach and recognition programs. The Society receives a core grant from the Hudson's Bay Company History Foundation annually, but operates as an independent entity. Its operating budget averages $2.7 million a year, and its largest share of revenues comes from its membership who in addition to subscribing to their magazines also contribute charitable donations. 66% of total annual revenues come from individual subscriptions and donations. 
Its flagship product is "Canada's History" magazine (until 2010 known as "The Beaver: Canada's History Magazine"). Produced 6 times a year with a current paid subscriber/membership base of 44,000. In addition, the History Society launched "Kayak: Canada's History Magazine for Kids" in 2003 which now published quarterly in English and in French as an insert to Quebec children's magazine Les Editions Les Debrouillards. Paid circulation for the English edition is just under 6,000. 
The History Society has published three books: For The Love of History (Random House 2005) An anthology of the collected works of the first decade of Pierre Berton Award recipients; Those Earlier Hills (Heritage House 2007) A collection of R.M. Patterson's articles appearing in The Beaver magazine; and 100 Photos That Changed Canada (2009)celebrating Canada's most memorable photographs. 
In addition to its publishing projects, the History Society produces Canada's History Awards, a national celebration of the country's top history honours including the Governor General’s Awards for Excellence in Teaching Canadian History and the Pierre Berton Award for achievement in popular history. In 2008, the History Society established the National Forum on Canadian History as part of the annual Awards events as an opportunity to bring students, teachers, historians, museum specials, and history organizations together to discuss ways to improve formal and informal history education in Canada.
From 2007-2009 it partnered with Hbc to administer the Hbc Local History Grants Program which provided modest support to small community-based history projects. Today the History Society continues to support local history organizations through the Canada's History Awards program as well as its website's news and travel services.
Canada's History Awards.
National honours included in awards program include:
Pierre Berton Award.
Established in 1994, the Pierre Berton Award is presented annually by the Society for distinguished achievement in presenting Canadian history in an informative and engaging manner. Canadian writer and historian Pierre Berton was the first recipient and agreed to lend his name to future awards. The award honours those who have introduced Canadian characters and events of the past to the national and international public.

Christian Samuel Weiss

Christian Samuel Weiss (February 26, 1780 – October 1, 1856) was a German mineralogist born in Leipzig. 
Following graduation, he worked as a physics instructor in Leipzig from 1803 until 1808. and in the meantime, conducted geological studies of mountain formations in Tyrol, Switzerland and France (1806–08). In 1810 he became a professor of mineralogy at the University of Berlin, where in 1818/19 and 1832/33, he served as university rector. He died near Eger in Bohemia.
Weiss is credited for creating parameters of modern crystallography, and was instrumental in making it a branch of mathematical science. He stressed the significance of direction in crystals, considering crystallographic axes to be a possible basis for classification of crystals. He is credited for introducing the categorization schema of crystal systems, and has a basic law of crystallography named after him called the "Weiss zone law".

Ventura Intercity Service Transit Authority

Ventura Intercity Service Transit Authority, or VISTA is a 
public transit agency providing bus service in Ventura County, California.
It is intended to provide an intercity bus service between Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo, Thousand Oaks,
Moorpark, Santa Paula, and Fillmore 
History.
Before VISTA was formed in 1994, the County of Ventura provided rudimentary
intercity bus service. One line ran along US 101 with stops in Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo,
Thousand Oaks, and Westlake Village. Another service linked Thousand Oaks and Moorpark via SR 23.
The City of Fillmore sponsored a few trips between Fillmore and Ventura along SR 126
Because of the limited nature of these services, the Ventura County Transportation Commission
proposed a comprehensive intercity bus system. 
Service on four core lines (Highway 101, Highway 126, East County and a "Central" route serving
Camarillo, Camarillo State Mental Hospital, Point Mugu and Oxnard) started in July 1994. Over time these
routes have been adjusted according to ridership. With the closing of Camarillo State Hospital, and
the repurposing of the hospital grounds as a California State University campus, the Central route
was cancelled, and two new campus shuttle routes implemented. In 1998, service was extended to 
Warner Center in Los Angeles County, and in 2001, service was extended to 
Santa Barbara.
The VISTA bus service is operated by a private company under contract to the VCTC. Due to the
length of the routes, over-the-road coaches are used.
Routes.
Highway 101.
Provides service along the length of US 101 in Ventura County, originating at the Pacific View Mall,
and stopping at various places in Oxnard, Camarillo, and Thousand Oaks.
Highway 126.
This route also originates at the Pacific View Mall in Ventura, and operates along SR 126 to 
Saticoy, Santa Paula and Fillmore.
East County.
VISTA East County route operates in the SR 23 corridor between Westlake Village,
Thousand Oaks, and Moorpark.
Conejo Connection.
Four round trips, two in the morning and two in the afternoon, connect Oxnard, Camarillo, and Thousand Oaks with 
the Warner Center Transit Hub and other stops at Warner Center, a business and residential complex in the western San Fernando Valley, in Los Angeles County. At the transit hub, riders may connect with the Metro Orange Line and other transit services from a variety of agencies, providing access to many points in Los Angeles County.
Coastal Express.
This route connects Ventura with Carpinteria and Santa Barbara. Peak hour trips also
serve Goleta and the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Mooney Aviation Company

The Mooney Aviation Company, Inc. (MAC) (formerly the Mooney Aircraft Company) is a Chinese-owned manufacturer of single-engined general aviation aircraft based in Kerrville, Texas, United States. 
The company has gone bankrupt and changed ownership several times. Among its achievements were the first pressurized single-engined, piston-powered aircraft (M22 Mustang), production of the fastest civilian single-engined, piston-powered aircraft in the world (M20TN Acclaim Type S), the first production aircraft to achieve on ) (M20J 201) and the fastest transcontinental flight in a single-engined, piston-powered production aircraft (M20K 231). All Mooney aircraft have the signature vertical stabilizer with its vertical leading edge and swept trailing edge that gives the illusion of being forward-swept.
History.
Mooney Aircraft Corporation was started in 1929 by Albert and Arthur Mooney with funding from the Bridgeport Machine Company of Wichita, Kansas. Mooney Aircraft went bankrupt in 1930. The Mooney brothers worked for other aircraft companies from then through World War II. In 1946, Albert started Mooney Aircraft, Inc. with Charles "Pappy" Yankey in Kerrville, Texas. The next year Arthur joined the company. 
The first aircraft produced by the new Mooney company was the small, single-seat, Mooney Mite M-18. It was designed to appeal to the thousands of fighter pilots leaving military service (some thought the Mooney Mite looked so much like the Messerschmitt Bf 109 that they called it the "Texas Messerschmitt".
The Mooney Mite established some of the design concepts still used by Mooney today. The model Mooney M20 entered production in 1955 and outwardly resembled a scaled-up Mite. Mooney is still producing variants of the M20 today.
In 1953, before funds were put in place for production of the M20, Mooney's financial backer, Charles Yankey, died of a stroke. In 1955, Albert Mooney sold his stock in the company to Harold Rachal and Norman Hoffman, then left the company to work for Lockheed Corporation. Shortly after, Arthur left Mooney to work for Lockheed, too.
In 1965, the company became the U.S. distributor for Mitsubishi aircraft and began selling the Mooney MU-2 operating as Mooney-Mitsubishi Aircraft Inc. In 1967, Mooney acquired production rights to the Ercoupe from Alon Aircraft Company and produced a slightly updated version as the Mooney M10 Cadet. The M10 became the final Ercoupe variant, and production ended in 1970.
Mooney went bankrupt again in early 1969 and was sold to American Electronics Labs, then to Butler Aviation, which ended operations in 1971. For about three years, Mooney failed to produce any aircraft. In 1973, Republic Steel Corporation acquired the rights and tooling for Mooney and resumed production in 1974. The company continued aggressive product development, working on yet another pressurized single-engined aircraft to compete with the Cessna 210. The turboprop Mooney "301" eventually became the TBM700 and is now produced by Socata Aircraft. Engineer, Roy LoPresti was hired as chief of research and development to update the M20, developing the efficient Mooney 201. In a 1979 interview, LoPresti noted that Mooney did not have the resources to develop radical new composite construction aircraft as did other manufacturers, and would focus on evolutionary development of conventional aircraft.
In 1984, Mooney merged with the French distribution firm Alexander Couvelaire. In July 2001, Mooney was the victim of yet another bankruptcy and the company was acquired by Advanced Aerodynamics and Structures, Inc. (AASI) in 2002. AASI resurrected Mooney under the name Mooney Aircraft Company, Inc., a division of Mooney Aerospace Group, Ltd.
In 2004, MASG (AASI) sold off the Mooney assets to Allen Holding Finance in May, and filed for bankruptcy on June 10. In December 2004, MASG restructured and reacquired Mooney Aircraft Company from Allen Holding Finance.
In November, 2004, Gretchen L. Jahn joined Mooney, becoming the first woman recruited to be CEO of a U.S. aircraft manufacturer. Jahn served for two years as a turnaround specialist, rebuilding Mooney's sales and dealer network, and after-sales service activities. She also oversaw the development and introduction of the M20TN Acclaim and the Garmin G1000-equipped Ovation2 GX and Bravo GX. In June, 2005, Mooney added a second shift and 50 new workers to boost production. 
On April 4, 2006, Mooney Airplane Company announced the release of the M20TN Acclaim at the 2006 Sun 'N Fun fly-in at Lakeland, Florida. The M20TN also features the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit, four heated, leather captains chairs with lumbar support, a range in excess of 1,650 nm (400 miles greater than the Bravo GX), and a top speed of which is also faster than the Ovation 2. At the time of its introduction, the Acclaim was the fastest single-engined, piston-powered production aircraft in the world.
Mooney was a publicly traded company after emerging from bankruptcy under symbol MNYG (OTC BB) until October, 2006, when Mooney Aerospace Group arranged financing to buy out public shareholders.
In the fall 2007, Mooney announced the arrival of its newest model, the M20TN Acclaim Type S. The Acclaim Type S adds to the Acclaim's top speed, up to . Mooney achieved this performance gain through aerodynamic tweaks to the Acclaim's airframe.
2008 production halt.
On 16 June 2008, Mooney announced it would lay off 60 employees and cut production from eight aircraft per month to five. Mooney CEO Dennis Ferguson said:
The reasons for the cutbacks and layoffs cited by the company include the weak US economy and the high price of fuel inhibiting sales.
On 5 November 2008, the company announced it was halting all production and had laid off 229 of its 320 employees, due to an excess unsold inventory of aircraft as a result of the late-2000s recession. Virtually all the laid-off employees were on the production line. The company said all other operations would continue and all customer support and existing customer orders would be filled.
In carrying out the layoffs, the company did not comply with the notification requirements of Texas law. In a statement Mooney said:
In a third round of layoffs in December 2008, the company let go an additional 40 workers, leaving only about 50 employees at work. The company had 25 unsold aircraft at its factory in December 2008.
2010s.
In April 2010, after 18 months with no aircraft production, the backlog of unsold aircraft was cleared and the company announced it intended to resume aircraft production in the near future, subject to the market gaining "a little more momentum".
On 19 November 2010, Mooney started a new round of layoffs, intending to reduce company staff from 53 to less than ten employees by 1 January 2011. The remaining staff will be employed maintaining the company's physical facilities, its type and production certificates and providing parts and technical support to aircraft owners. The company is continuing negotiations with potential investors to allow production to resume. Company Chief Financial Officer Barry Hodkin stated, "We are not shutting down. However, we cannot continue to subsidize the company at the level we have in the recent past. We have been in discussions with potential investors for more than 18 months and will continue to work with them. If things change, then the scope of this layoff could change".
By August 2013 the company was still not producing new aircraft, but was continuing to support the existing fleet with parts. The company still indicated that a return to production of complete aircraft was contemplated, depending on new investment being found.
On 8 October 2013, it was announced that the company had been purchased by Soaring America Corporation, a new California-based company headed by President Cheng Yuan (Jerry Chen) of Taiwan, for an undisclosed amount. Chen heads a group of Chinese investors that some reports indicate include the Meijing Group, a Chinese real estate developer. Chen indicated that his priorities included resuming production of the Acclaim and the Ovation, while continuing to supply parts for the existing fleet. Chen stated that the company would remain in Kerrville, Texas and concentrate on suppling new aircraft for the Chinese market. Paul Bertorelli, AVweb's Editorial Director, Aviation Publications, questioned whether the outdated and expensive-to-produce Mooney models, that use engines burning avgas, can succeed in the Chinese market.
With the injection of capital from its new Chinese owners the company restarted production on 26 February 2014, starting with the completion of five previously incomplete airframes already on the assembly line. In April 2014 at Sun n Fun the company announced a US$50M investment, including the construction of a Mooney museum in Kerrville to be run by a new nonprofit organization. With production underway 85 employees were at work with the workforce forecast to expand to 140y the end of 2014. CEO Chen stated that the company would deliver six aircraft in 2014 and 30 in 2015.

Mattia Bortoloni

Mattia Bortoloni (31 March 1696 – 1750) was an Italian painter of the Rococo period, mainly active in the area of Bergamo and Venice.
Biography.
He was born in the town of San Bellino in the Polesine region of the Province of Rovigo. He trained with Antonio Balestra of Verona. Bortoloni painted the 104-panel fresco cycle at Villa Cornaro, a Palladian villa in Piombino Dese near Padua. He also painted a ceiling in the Ca' Rezzonico. Other examples of Bortoloni's work are displayed at various monuments in the Veneto and Lombardy, including the parish churches at Castelgugielmo and Fratta Polesine, and in the ceilings at the Church of San Nicolò da Tolentino (presbytery, c. 1730) and the palazzo Ca' Vendramin Calergi. Along with Giuseppe Galli Bibiena (of the Galli Bibiena family of artists) and Felice Biella, in 1746–48, Bortoloni helped complete ceiling frescoes in the Vicoforte Sanctuary.
In Venice, he painted "Glory of St Cajetan" for the ceiling of the choir of the Theatine church of San Nicola Tolentini. He painted a "Madonna and Saints" for the Hospital of SS. Pietro e Paolo in Venice.
In Bergamo, he worked alongside the Milanese stucco-artist, Riva Palazzi, to decorate the ceiling of the choir, presbytery with figures and decoration. In Brescia, he painted a medallion for the Gallery in the house of Signori Barbisoni. In Ferrara, he painted a "Glory of St Thomas Aquinas" for the Cathedral and a canvas of Saints Cosma e Damiano for the Oratory of the Speziali.
In Turin, he painted for the half-dome of the apse of the church of the La Consolata. In the same church, in the third chapel on the right, he painted a fresco of St Bernard, alongside the stucco work of Felice Biella. In Mondovi, he painted in the church of the Sanctuary of the Madonna di Vico.
In Milan, in the church of San Vittore al Corpo he painted a lateral panel for the chapel of the Blessed Bernardo Tolomei. From Milan, he moved to Bergamo, where he was commissioned to paint the ceiling of the church of Santi Bartolomeo e Stefano and had made designs to paint the four quadrants of the world, as Pozzi had done for the church of Sant'Ignazio in Rome, when he developed a sudden fever and died after two days on June 9, 1750.

Ermengol VI, Count of Urgell

Ermengol (or Armengol) VI (1096–1154), called "el de Castilla", was the Count of Urgell from 1102 to his death. He was the son and successor of Ermengol V and María Pérez.
He was born in Valladolid, whence his nickname comes. During his minority, he was under the regency of his grandfather, Pedro Ansúrez, lord of Valladolid, but the real power lay in the hands of Guerau II of Cabrera and Raymond Berenguer III of Barcelona. With their help, the young count conquered Balaguer in 1106 and made it his capital.
Armengol collaborated with Alfonso the Battler in the 1118 capture of Zaragoza and in the expedition of Alfonso VII the Emperor against Almería in 1147. He had good relations with the House of Barcelona and he accompanied Raymond Berengar IV's to Provence in 1144. In 1149, he assisted Raymond Berengar in the conquest and repopulation of Lleida, which was thenceforward a city of his dominion. Ermengol died in Castile.
In 1129, Ermengol married Arsenda de Cabrera, daughter of the viscount Ponç of Àger. Besides his successor, Ermengol VII, he had two daughters with her: Sibylla, who married Ramon Folch, viscount of Cardona, and Stephanie, who married Arnau Mir of Pallars Jussà.
In 1135, Ermengol married a second time to Elvira, daughter of Rodrigo of Lara and Sancha of Castile. To this union were born Galceran de Sales and Mary, lady of Almenara.

Trichophyton rubrum

Trichophyton rubrum is a fungus that is the most common cause of athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. This fungus was first described by Malmsten in 1845. 
The growth rate of "Trichophyton" colonies in the lab can be slow to rather quick. Their texture is waxy, smooth and even to cottony. From the top, the color is white to bright yellowish beige or red violet. Reverse is pale, yellowish, brown, or reddish-brown. Although Trichophyton rubrum is the most common of the dermatophytes causing fingernail fungus infections, there are others. "Trichophyton interdigitale" is the second most common source of fungal nail infections from the dermatophyte group. (Used to be called Trichophyton mentagrophytes var interdigitale - new guidelines now state that a fungus can only be called T mentagrophytes if it is isolated from an animal - the human variant is T. interdigitale)
Identification.
Positive, selective diagnosis of "T. rubrum" is difficult as many members of the genus react similarly with test reagents. The Mycology Unit at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital uses a dermatophyte identification scheme comprising 6 different media to help identify and differentiate the various species and strains of "Trichophyton". The media in this scheme are Littman Oxgall agar, Lactritmel agar, Sabouraud's agar with 5% NaCl, 1% Peptone agar, Trichophyton agar No. 1, and hydrolysis of urea.

<doc id="9784400" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9784400" title="Simple API for Grid Applications">
Simple API for Grid Applications

The Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA) is a family of related standards specified by the Open Grid Forum to define an application programming interface (API) for common distributed computing functionality.
Overview.
The SAGA specification for distributed computing originally consisted of a single document, GFD.90, which was released in 2009.
The SAGA API does not strive to replace Globus or similar grid computing middleware systems, and does not target middleware developers, but application developers with no background on grid computing. Such developers typically wish to devote their time to their own goals and minimize the time spent coding infrastructure functionality. The API insulates application developers from middleware.
The specification of services, and the protocols to interact with them, is out of the scope of SAGA. Rather, the API seeks to hide the detail of any service infrastructures that may or may not be used to implement the functionality that the application developer needs. The API aligns, however, with all middleware standards within Open Grid Forum (OGF).
The SAGA API defined a mechanism to specify additional API "packages" which expand its scope. The SAGA Core API itself defines a number of packages: job management, file management, replica management, remote procedure calls, and streams. SAGA covers the most important and frequently used distributed functionality and is supported and available on every major grid systems - XSEDE, EGI and FutureGrid. SAGA not only supports a wide range of distributed programming and coordination models but is also easily extensible to support new and emerging middleware.
Standardization.
The SAGA API is standardised in the SAGA Working Group the Open Grid Forum. Based on a set of use cases
the SAGA Core API specification defines a set of general API principles (the 'SAGA Look and Feel', and a set of API packages which render commonly used Grid programming patterns (job management, file management and access, replica management etc.) The SAGA Core specification also defines how additional API packages are to be defined, and how they relate to the Core API, and to its 'Look and Feel'. Based on that, a number of API extensions have been defined, and are in various states of the standardisation process.
All SAGA specifications are defined in (a flavor of) IDL, and thus object oriented, but language neutral. Different language bindings exist (Java, C++, Python), but are, at this point, not standardised. Nevertheless, different implementations of these language bindings have a relatively coherent API definition (in particular, the different Java implementations share the same abstract API interface classes).
The 'Look and Feel' part of the SAGA Core API specification covers the following areas:
Architecture.
SAGA is designed as an object oriented interface. It encapsulates related functionality in a set of objects, that are grouped in functional namespaces, which are called "packages" in SAGA. The SAGA core implementation defines the following packages:
The overall architecture of SAGA follows the adaptor pattern, a software design pattern which is used for translating one interface into another. In SAGA it translates the calls from the API packages to the interfaces of the underlying middleware. The SAGA run-time system uses late binding to decide at run-time which plug-in ("middleware adaptor") to load and bind.
Supported middleware.
The following table lists the distributed middleware systems that are currently supported by SAGA. The column labeled "Adaptor Suite" names the collection (release package) of the (set of) middleware adaptors that provides support for the middleware system.
Implementations.
Since the SAGA interface definitions are not bound to any specific programming language, several implementations of the SAGA 
standards exist in different programming languages. Apart from the implementation language, they differ from each other in their completeness in terms of standard coverage, as well as in their support for distributed middleware.
SAGA C++.
SAGA C++ was the first complete implementation of the SAGA Core specification, written in C++. Currently the C++ implementation is not under active development.
SAGA-Bliss (Python).
SAGA-Bliss (originally called just Bliss, an acronym that stands for "BLiss IS Saga") is a light-weight Python package that implements parts of the OFD GFD.90 interface specification and provides plug-ins for different distributed middleware systems and services. SAGA-Bliss implements the most commonly used features of GFD.90 based upon extensive use-case analysis, and focuses on usability and simple deployment in real-world heterogeneous distributed computing environments and application scenarios. SAGA-Bliss currently implements the job and the file management core APIs as well as the resource management API extension. SAGA-Bliss provides plug-ins for different distributed middleware systems and services, including support for the PBS, Sun Grid Engine, SSH, SFTP, SRM and Eucalyptus. SAGA-Bliss can be used to develop distributed applications and frameworks that run on distributed cyber-infrastructure including XSEDE, LONI and FutureGrid, other clouds and local clusters.
JavaSAGA.
JavaSAGA is a Java implementation of SAGA. This status of JavaSAGA remains uncertain.
jSAGA.
jSAGA is another Java implementation of the SAGA Core specification. jSAGA is currently under active development.
DESHL.
The DESHL (DEISA Services for Heterogeneous management Layer), provides functionality for submission and management of computational jobs within DEISA. DESHL is implemented as a set of command-line tools on-top of a SAGA-inspired API implemented in Java. On the back-end, it interfaces with HiLA, a generic grid access client library, which is part of the UNICORE system.
Examples.
Job submission.
A typical task in a distributed application is to submit a "job" to a local or remote distributed resource manager. SAGA provides a high-level API called the "job package" for this. The following two simple examples show how the SAGA job package API can be used to submit a Message Passing Interface (MPI) job to a remote Globus GRAM resource manager. 
C++:
Python:
Grants.
The work related to the SAGA Project is funded by the following grants:NSF-CHE 1125332 (CDI), NSF-EPS 1003897 (LaSIGMA), NSF-OCI 1007115 (ExTENCI). Previous grants include: NSF-OCI 0710874 (HPCOPS), NIH grant number P20RR016456 and UK EPSRC grant number GR/D0766171/1 via OMII-UK

Mount Saint Joseph Academy (Boston, Massachusetts)

The school will provide students with a global perspective and a project-based and personalized educational program that seeks to enhance their analytical and critical thinking skills. The school will also feature a multi-cultural learning environment and vibrant theology and campus ministry programs that will ensure the moral formation of all students in the social justice and ethical teachings of the Catholic Church.
Saint Joseph Preparatory High School will form relationships with a range of community organizations, including neighboring Boston College and its Lynch School of Education, and Regis College of Weston.
History.
Founded and sponsored by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Boston, Mount Saint Joseph Academy promotes academic excellence, cultivates respect for all people, fosters unity and reconciliation, and educates young women for compassionate leadership and service.
When the Brothers of St. Joseph settled in Boston in 1873, they were eager to continue their educational ministry begun in Brooklyn, NY, and in 1884 under the leadership of Mother Mary Regis and Msgr. Magennis, they were able to purchase and remodel the Fresh Pond Hotel in Cambridge, converting the property into an academy for young ladies, known as Mount Saint Joseph Academy. 
Mount Saint Joseph Academy, a boarding school for elementary and high school girls, opened on September 7, 1885. The Academy was founded by the Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Boston, to educate and prepare students with a sound secular education combined with Catholic religious instruction.
1800s.
When the school opened its doors, eleven students attended. These young ladies were taught by Mother Regis and three other sisters, S. Mary Agnes, S. Mary Genevieve and S. St. James. On June 29, 1886, the Mount held its first commencement exercises, graduating three students. 
In May 1891, the Academy was forced to relocate. The City of Cambridge reclaimed the land at Fresh Pond by public domain, and the school moved to its present site in Brighton, Massachusetts in 1892. The formal opening and dedication of the new Academy in Brighton was held on the Feast of St. Joseph, March 19, 1892. Since that date, the Mount has continued to grow. 
The faculty, which initially consisted of just four Sisters of Saint Joseph, has expanded to include professional members of religious congregations and lay people. For the past one hundred seventeen years, the Sisters of Saint Joseph along with many dedicated lay women and men, have remained faithful to that mission of its founders, "to cultivate the intellect and make a special training of the heart."
1900s.
The classroom building, which opened in 1913, originally served girls from grades one through twelve, and had dormitories and private rooms for the seniors on the fifth floor, while on the fourth floor were two large rooms for elementary students. Large classrooms, an auditorium, music rooms, two science laboratories, dining and day student locker areas characterized this neoclassic structure. As the enrollment of the day students expanded, dormitories were converted into classrooms. In the early 1950s, the elementary school was closed, and by the end of that decade, all boarding was discontinued. Since that time, Mount Saint Joseph Academy has served as a day high school for young women in grades nine through twelve. 
During the next several decades, as the school continued to grow, physical and program changes were made to serve the needs of the students. In 1964, the gymnasium and the cafeteria were built. In the 1980s, the science laboratory and the guidance facilities were restructured. In 1983, the Congregation separately incorporated Mount Saint Joseph Academy. A Board of Trustees was composed of nine lay persons together with six Sisters of Saint Joseph. 
In the early 1980s, the religious identity of the student population become more diverse. In response to this change, the services offered by Campus Ministry were expanded to enrich students in their spiritual development and to maintain the Catholic identity of Mount Saint Joseph Academy. As part of the Academy's mission to foster its students' spiritual development, the chapel in the Motherhouse continues to be used for religious celebrations and important selected school events. 
In the 1990s, a computer classroom was added to the school. Several years later, additional improvements to the computer room included Internet access and the installation of Internet connections throughout the school. As recently as 1998, the science laboratory was renovated. Further additions to the school in the 1990s included the installation of tennis courts and a softball field.
Trinity Catholic history.
In October 2009, the school celebrated its 115th anniversary with a fundraising event that highlighted the school's history, accomplishments, and current and former students. All of the proceeds went to the funding of scholarships for future students. The event featured many prominent community guests including the former mayor of Newton, David Cohen, the Newton Community Chorus, and the current Boston College head hockey coach, Jerry York, who gave a speech. Other speakers included current students and faculty.

Julius Conus

Julius Conus (, "Yúlij Eduárdovič Konyús"; 1 February 1869 3 January, 1942; better known by the above French name, sometimes rendered Jules or Julien) was a Russian Empire and Soviet violinist and composer.
Conus was born in Moscow on to a distinguished musical family of French extraction who had migrated to Russia at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. His father was the piano teacher , and his brothers were the composer and music teacher Georgi Conus and pianist Lev Conus. All three studied at Moscow Conservatory under Sergei Taneyev and Anton Arensky, and all three stayed on to teach there.
In 1888 he won the Gold Medal at the Moscow Conservatory. He then studied in Paris, where he played the violin in the Opera orchestra and was a virtuoso in his own right for several years. In 1891, he became a concertmaster in New York City. From 1893 to 1901, he taught violin at the Moscow Conservatory and formed a close friendship with Sergei Rachmaninoff. One of his notable students was violinist, composer, and conductor Alexander Chuhaldin. He also gave concerts, both as a soloist and as a chamber musician, appearing sometimes in a Trio or other ensemble with Rachmaninoff to play the latter's works. (Rachmaninoff dedicated his Two Pieces for Violin and Piano, op. 6, to Julius, and the two men remained close friends throughout their lives.)
Conus had two sons, Serge and Boris. (Boris married Rachmaninoff's daughter Tatiana in 1932, and together they had a son the following year.) After the October Revolution, Conus moved to Paris in 1919 with his brother Lev, and began to teach at the Russian Conservatory there in 1921. However as the Nazi threat spread across Europe, Lev emigrated to the US in 1935, and in 1939 Julius returned to Russia. Julius Conus died in Moscow, at Melenki on 3 January 1942.
Besides pedagogical works, Conus was known for his adeptness at long-lined melody, as shown particularly in his Violin Concerto in E minor which he premiered in Moscow in 1898 when he was 29 years old. An effective showpiece, it became a repertoire staple in Russia and was long popular with audiences, although it was dismissed by critics. Conus, a violinist himself, wrote no other major work, although he did produce several shorter pieces for violin, which are mostly unplayed today.
In the early 1900s Fritz Kreisler championed the concerto, giving its first performance in London (1904). However it was Jascha Heifetz who was to become the Concerto's true champion. He included it in his worldwide concert repertoire, and from 1920 played it many times in Carnegie Hall. He also recorded it with the RCA Symphony Orchestra under Izler Solomon in 1952.

The Association of Co-educational Schools (ACS) is a group of six independent Christian schools in Victoria, Australia. The Association was formed in 1997. The 6 schools involved all share very similar beliefs in regard to life, beliefs and educating secondary ages children. The ACS only caters for students from years 7-12.
Sport.
The ACS does not run a Saturday sport program like some independent schools in Victoria do. Instead matches are held after school with Years 7&8 competing on Tuesday, Years 10,11&12 competing on Wednesday and Year 9 competing on Thursday. After school ACS sport is compulsory for all students who attend ACS schools. Training is also held after school on a different day of the week to the respective students match.
Each year there is a swimming, athletics and cross country running competition that is optional. St. Michael's Grammar School, St. Kilda have been particularly successful at winning these in recent years with Westbourne Grammar School, Truganina being the arch-rivals.
2012 ACS Athletics Carnival.
In 2012 the ACS Athletics carnival was cancelled mid-way through due to severe thunderstorms, rain, hail and numerous injuries. The carnival was never rescheduled to another date

<doc id="9784471" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9784471" title="Alpha secretase">
Alpha secretase

Alpha secretases are a family of proteolytic enzymes that cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) in its transmembrane region. Specifically, alpha secretases cleave within the fragment that gives rise to the Alzheimer's disease-associated peptide amyloid beta when APP is instead processed by beta secretase and gamma secretase. The alpha-secretase pathway is the predominant APP processing pathway. Thus, alpha-secretase cleavage precludes amyloid beta formation and is considered to be part of the non-amyloidogenic pathway in APP processing. Alpha secretases are members of the ADAM ('a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain') family, which are expressed on the surfaces of cells and anchored in the cell membrane. Several such proteins, notably ADAM10, have been identified as possessing alpha-secretase activity. Upon cleavage by alpha secretases, APP releases its extracellular domain - a fragment known as APPsα - into the extracellular environment in a process known as "ectodomain shedding". 
ADAM10 consists of two protein domains, a disintegrin domain and a prodomain; however, only the prodomain is required for APP processing. Other ADAM proteins, ADAM17 (also called TACE, "tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme"), ADAM9, and ADAM19 have also been identified as alpha secretases; extracellular expression of mutant ADAM9 (also known as MDC9 or meltrin gamma) lacking the membrane anchor domain has been suggested as one of many possible means of Alzheimer's prevention and treatment exploiting the alpha secretase pathway. Two distinct modalities of alpha-secretase activity have been observed in cells; constitutive activity occurs mainly at the cell surface and is independent of regulatory mechanisms inside the cell, while regulated activity occurs mainly in the golgi and is dependent on the activity of protein kinase C. Alpha-secretase activity in the golgi is thought to compete directly with the beta-secretase pathway for APP substrates during membrane protein maturation. Cell-surface cleavage by alpha secretase is very rapid after APP reaches the cell surface.
The activity of alpha secretases has been implicated in the regulation of learning and memory formation. Release of the APPsα ectodomain has neurotrophic effects that counteract apoptotic signaling and promote synapse formation, processes that are upregulated when ADAM10 is overexpressed. Alpha secretase activity has also been observed to be upregulated in response to the signaling peptide PACAP.
Related alpha-secretases, including ADAM10, have also been implicated in similar maturation events for other transmembrane proteins such as MHC class I proteins. Recent evidence suggests that some such proteins are first processed to ectodomains by alpha secretases and subsequently cleaved by another Alzheimer's-associated protease complex, gamma secretase in its presenilin-complexed form. The Notch pathway bears many similarities to APP processing and is also regulated in part by ADAM10.

KSCZ-LP

KSCZ-LP was a low power broadcast television station in San Benito County, California that broadcast on analog channel 42. The station was operated by Venture Technologies Group, LLC. Although the station is currently silent, it is still licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
History.
Signing on as K42DT, the station had been owned by the Trinity Broadcasting Network. By 2002 the station was under the ownership of Venture Technologies Group, which it continues to be owned.
From 2002, the station became silent, and was granted a temporary authority license the following year by the FCC. In May 2006 the station owners moved the station's location from Coalinga Ridge in Coalinga, California to a transmitter site on Mt. San Benito, and changed the station's city of license to Greenfield, California.
KSCZ went silent at 4pm on Sunday, March 18, 2007 by Brian Holton of Venture Technology Group, licensee. Pending resolution of an FCC filing against it by Marty Jackson of Monterey, California, it may return to the air serving Santa Cruz, California. 
On October 11, 2007, KSCZ-LP was granted an original construction permit for a digital companion channel by the FCC under the callsign of KSCZ-LD. The digital station is expected to broadcast digitally on channel 20 from a transmitter site in Fremont Peak, from where other Salinas and Monterey-area broadcasters transmit.
Programming.
It is unknown what programming the station previously broadcast, though it is assumed to have broadcast Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) network programming under TBN ownership. It also broadcast a moving test pattern consisting of a repeating hour showing ships sailing under the Golden Gate Bridge, as viewed from the Marin Headlands. Video for this test pattern was shot by 2006 Venture employee Frank Martin. Music on the audio playing during this 'test pattern' was original compositions from Steve Salani of orchestra.net. This 'test pattern' repeating hour broadcast continuously from sign on at the Mt. San Benito site on May 18, 2006 until sign off by Brian Holton..
Technical information.
KSCZ-LP TV channel 42 is located at the American Tower Site on Mt. San Benito in San Benito County, California. Mt. San Benito is located near the historic mining town of New Idria, a posted Cinnabar mine closed due to mercury pollution. New Idria has been a superfund toxic waste cleanup site since 1974.
KSCZ-LP could be viewed in northern Central California, broadcasting from Mt. San Benito between Interstate 5 and Highway 101. The station used a 1 kW NTSC transmitter with directional parabolic antennas directed at the community of Greenfield, California with an effective radiated power of 70KW. 
The frequency shift keying of the morse code version of the call letters KSCZ-LP could be heard by tuning towards channel 43 in Clovis, California.

Mount Saint Joseph Academy (Flourtown, Pennsylvania)

Mount Saint Joseph Academy, commonly called The Mount, in Flourtown, Pennsylvania is a Philadelphia-area all-female, catholic, college preparatory school. It was founded in 1858 by the Sisters of Saint Joseph. The academy was originally located in Philadelphia on the grounds of what is now Chestnut Hill College. Originally a boarding school, the academy began accepting day students in 1911. In 1928, this all girls high school was the first Catholic school to be approved by the Middle States Association accrediting agency. In response to the growth of the school and evolving educational needs, the Mount moved in 1961 to its present site, just outside the community of Chestnut Hill near Philadelphia. Since relocation to the new campus, the school has grown significantly. 
Academic Program.
After beginning with 20 students in 1858, the Mount has a present day student body of 560. A private day school for girls in grades nine through twelve, the Mount offers a college preparatory education in a Catholic context. 
The Mount adopted intensive (block) scheduling in 2001. Students now take three or four credits per term (instead of six or seven) for a total of seven or eight credits per school year. Each class period is 80 minutes long and traditional year-long courses last for 16 weeks (September to January or January to June).
Facilities.
The school building, which was constructed during the 1960s, offers classrooms, a cafeteria, 600 seat auditorium, gymnasium, chapel, and choir room.
In 1997 a new wing was completed, featuring a library/media center with computer, telecommunications and video capabilities; six classrooms; a computer/writing center, a guidance suite, and faculty areas which allow space for interdisciplinary projects and class preparations.
In 2003 the art and theater rooms were renovated with additional space to become a painting and drawing room; a computer classroom with 25 computer graphics systems; separate rooms for ceramics and a kiln; and a classroom for theater arts. At the same time, the gym locker area was renovated to include a new locker room, a health class area, and a fitness center. On the campus grounds are an enclosed courtyard and playing fields. In the Fall 2004 a track field surrounding a soccer field was completed, along with two new softball fields. 
Notable Alumnae.
Rose Hemingway (née Szczesniak) - performer starring in the 2011 Broadway musical revival of “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" opposite Daniel Radcliffe.

Charles P. Hall

Charles Philip Hall (December 12, 1886 - January 26, 1953) was an American General most notable for being the commander of the U.S. Army's XI Corps during World War II and the principal commander during the Battle of Bataan to liberate the Philippines from Japanese forces.
Early career and World War I.
Hall was born in Sardis, Mississippi and attended the University of Mississippi from 1905 to 1907. He then entered the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and was commissioned in 1911 as a second lieutenant of infantry. He served with the 20th Infantry Regiment until 1914, when he became an instructor in mathematics at West Point. In August 1917, he transferred to the 23rd Infantry Regiment, and then went to France for World War I. In March 1918, he became the adjutant of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. He served at Verdun, Chateau Thierry, at Soissons in the Marne Offensive, in the St. Mihiel sector, and at Champagne in the Aisne Offensive.
Hall received the Army Distinguished Service Cross, second to the Medal of Honor, for extraordinary heroism in action at Vierzy, France on July 18, 1918. His citation read: "At a critical time in the battle, when information was difficult to obtain, Lieutenant Colonel Hall, Brigade Adjutant, volunteered to report on the fighting in Vierzy, which was then in the hands of the enemy. Accompanying a group of French tanks, he entered the town under intense fire; and, during the advance, went forward through machine-gun fire and carried to safety a wounded man. He assisted materially in maintaining organization among the troops and established a first aid station at which many wounded were cared for, returning later to Brigade Headquarters with valuable information." 
In addition, Hall was awarded three silver star medals for gallantry. He also received the French Croix de Guerre for bravery on October 4, 1918, as well as the Legion of Honor.
Between the wars.
After service with the Army of Occupation until August 1919, Hall returned to the United States with the 2nd Division, remaining as brigade and then division adjutant until 1922. He served on the Infantry Board from 1922 to 1923, and was then a student at the Infantry School. From 1924 to 1925, he attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, where he was a distinguished graduate. He then served as an instructor at the Infantry School until 1929, when he entered the Army War College.
After graduation from the Army War College in 1930, he spent two years in the Philippines. He then returned to Fort Benning as an instructor at the Infantry School from 1932 to 1937. From 1937 to 1940, he was Director of Ground Arms, Air Corps Tactical School, Maxwell Field, Alabama. In 1940, he took command of the 11th Infantry Regiment.
World War II to retirement.
In 1941-42, he served with the 3rd Infantry Division as assistant division commander and briefly as division commanding general. He then commanded the 93rd Infantry Division from May to October 1942.
In October 1942, he took command of the XI Corps. He led the corps in combat in New Guinea and on Morotai. The corps then fought at Leyte and on Luzon in the Philippine Campaign, most notably in the Battle of Bataan. In September 1945, the corps landed at Yokohama for the initial occupation of Japan. Hall relinquished command of the corps on March 15, 1946.
From March 1946 to December 1948, he served as the Director of Organization and Training on the War Department General Staff (from 1947 the Department of the Army). He retired on December 31, 1948 and was placed on the retired list as a lieutenant general on January 1, 1949. He died on January 26, 1953 in San Antonio, Texas, and was buried in the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery.

Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport is an airport in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. The airport is south of the city.
In November 2007, Skywest Airlines attempted a three times weekly direct service from Kalgoorlie to Melbourne, which failed due to lack of patronage. This service was reinstated once weekly, departing on a Friday and returning on a Sunday. The airport handled 259,958 passengers in the year ending 30 June 2011 making it the 21st busiest airport in Australia. Early in 2010 they were re-introduced by Skywest Airlines. QantasLink also started flights between Kalgoorlie and Adelaide due to the lack of services between the goldfields and the eastern states of Australia. Kalgoorlie Airport is a major hub for fly-in fly-out service due to the mining boom in the region. Kalgoorlie Airport is also a hub for the Goldfields Air Services which offers chartering and flight lessons, along with the Royal Flying Doctors Service which uses Kalgoorlie as a hub due the lack of medical assistance for people in the region, transporting major injuries from Kalgoorlie to Perth.
Kalgoorlie Airport has a single terminal which was recently upgraded. The airport is served by two airlines. Following its takeover of Skywest in 2013, Virgin Australia Regional Airlines uses Kalgoorlie as a stop over for its Melbourne routes, whilst Qantas has always had a much stronger appearance in the airport. The airport also used to serve Ansett Australia before they went bankrupt.

James French (murderer)

James D. French (ca. 1936 – 10 August 1966) was an American criminal who was the last person executed under Oklahoma's death penalty laws prior to "Furman v. Georgia", which suspended capital punishment in the United States from 1972 until 1976. He was also the only prisoner executed in the United States that year. Already in prison for life, but allegedly afraid to commit suicide, French murdered his cellmate, apparently to compel the state to execute him.
French has been attributed with famous last words before his death by electric chair: "How's this for your headline? 'French Fries'".
This was the last execution by electric chair in the United States before "Furman v. Georgia"; after the moratorium on capital punishment was lifted, the first electrocution was John Spenkelink in 1979 in Florida.

Valentine Simmes

Valentine Simmes (fl. 1585 – 1622) was an Elizabethan era and Jacobean era printer; he did business in London, "on Adling Hill near Bainard's Castle at the sign of the White Swan." Simmes has a reputation as one of the better printers of his generation, and was responsible for several quartos of Shakespeare's plays. Early texts of Shakespeare's works.
Nothing is known of Simmes's early life or personal history. He was active as a printer starting in 1585. 
Shakespeare.
In an eight-year period from 1597 through 1604, Simmes printed nine Shakespearean quartos for various London stationers or booksellers.
For the bookseller Andrew Wise, Simmes printed:
For Wise and William Aspley, Simmes printed:
For Thomas Millington, Simmes printed:
For Nicholas Ling and John Trundell, Simmes printed:
For Matthew Law, Simmes printed:
Also for Nicholas Ling, Simmes printed Q3 of "The Taming of a Shrew" (1607), the alternative version of Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew." (Scholars dispute the exact nature of the relationship between the two versions.) And for Thomas Pavier, Simmes printed Q1 of "Sir John Oldcastle" (1600), a play of the Shakespeare Apocrypha. For "the Widow Newman," Simmes printed the second, 1607 edition of Lawrence Twine's "The Pattern of Painful Adventures," one of the sources for Shakespeare's "Pericles, Prince of Tyre."
Other drama.
Simmes also printed a range of other significant texts in English Renaissance theatre, including:
— among other works. In Simmes's era, the specialties of printer and bookseller/publisher were usually practiced separately, though some individuals, like William Jaggard, functioned in both. Simmes normally kept to the printshop side of the business, though he did occasionally publish too, as with the first quartos of George Chapman's "Humorous Day's Mirth" and Thomas Dekker's "Shoemaker's Holiday." 
Other works.
Best known for his printing of plays, Simmes worked on non-dramatic projects as well; he printed "Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum" (1611) for the bookseller Richard Bonian — a volume of poems by Emilia Lanyer, it was one of the very rare books by a woman published in that era. For John Clapham's "The History of Great Britain" (1606), he was both printer and publisher.
Reputation.
While Simmes is recognized as among the best printers of his generation, a cynic might complain that this is not saying much — that it merely identifies Simmes as the best of a bad lot. Simmes, or his compositors, allowed 69 typographical errors in "Richard II," Q1; when they printed Q2 they corrected 14 of these typos, but added 123 new ones.
Apart from his reputation for quality, Simmes "was constantly in trouble for printing unauthorized works, and in 1622 was forbidden to work as a master printer."

John Alexander (tenor)

John Alexander (October 21, 1923 – December 8, 1990) was an American operatic tenor who had a substantial career during the 1950s through the 1980s. He had a longstanding relationship with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, singing with that company every year between 1961 and 1987 for a total of 379 performances. He also periodically performed at the New York City Opera during his career and was a frequent presence at the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company during the late 1950s and 1960s. Although he spent most of his career in New York City, Alexander occasionally traveled to perform as a guest artist with many of the world's leading opera houses, both in the United States and Europe. He was also an active concert singer throughout his career.
While most of Alexander's career was spent in lyric roles from the Italian and French repertory, Alexander had enough heft in his voice to successfully tackle some of the lighter Heldentenor roles of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss. Aside from a handful of these roles, however, his repertoire at the Metropolitan did not include heavier parts. Rather, he was known there for an expansive lyric repertoire that encompassed the works of Mozart, Puccini, Verdi, and Donizetti among others. His signature roles included Alfredo in "La traviata", Arbace in "Idomeneo", Belmonte in "Die Entführung aus dem Serail", the Duke of Mantua in "Rigoletto", Edgardo from "Lucia di Lammermoor", Ferrando in "Così fan tutte", Hoffman in "Les contes d'Hoffmann", Lieutenant B. F. Pinkerton in "Madama Butterfly", Rodolfo in "La bohème", and the title roles in "Don Carlos" and "Faust".
Early life and career.
Alexander was born and raised in Meridian, Mississippi. He attended the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, earning a Bachelors of Music in Vocal Performance. Many years later, while still working regularly for the Metropolitan Opera, he returned to the conservatory as a member of the voice faculty. 
In 1951 Alexander moved to New York City to begin studying voice further under Robert Weede and with the intent of pursuing a performance career. That same year he auditioned for and was accepted as a member of the Charles Wagner Opera Company, a touring company which traveled throughout North America. He traveled widely with the company during the Fall of 1951, notably portraying Alfredo in Giuseppe Verdi's "La traviata" opposite a young Beverly Sills as Violetta. In the spring of 1952 he made his first appearance with at an actual opera house as the title hero in Charles Gounod's "Faust" with Cincinnati Opera. The following fall he once again traveled with the Charles Wagner Opera Company, this time singing Don José in Bizet's "Carmen" opposite Sill's Micaëla. Over the next five years he appeared in several houses throughout the United States including the Baltimore Opera Company and the Houston Grand Opera. 
In 1957 Alexander made his debut with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company as Lieutenant Pinkerton in Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" opposite Dorothy Kirsten as Cio-Cio San. That same year he made his first appearance with the New York City Opera singing the role of Alfredo. The following year he returned to the New York City Opera to portray the role of Henry Morosus for the United States premiere of Richard Strauss's "Die schweigsame Frau". He continued to perform periodically at the New York City Opera up through the 1970s, notably excelling as Walther in Wagner's "Die Meistersinger" and as Bacchus in Richard Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos". 
On February 10, 1958, Alexander portrayed the role of Rodolfo opposite Elaine Malbin's Mimì in Giacomo Puccini's "La bohème" for the very first opera performance given by the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company. He returned several more times for performances with that company, including portrayals of Vicomte Camille de Jolidon in "Die lustige Witwe" (1958), Lieutenant Pinkerton (1959, 1962, 1963), Sir Edgardo di Ravenswood in "Lucia di Lammermoor" (1960, 1961), Ferrando in "Così fan tutte" (1960), Alfredo (1961, 1963, 1972), Faust (1967), Gennaro in "Lucrezia Borgia" (1969), and Roberto, conte di Leicester in "Maria Stuarda" (1974).
Later life and career.
In 1961 Alexander joined the roster of the Metropolitan Opera where he sang regularly for the next 26 years. He made his first appearance on the Met stage as Ferrando in "Così fan tutte" on December 19, 1961 with Teresa Stich-Randall as Fiordiligi, Rosalind Elias as Dorabella, Theodor Uppman as Guglielmo, Roberta Peters as Despina, and Frank Guarrera as Don Alfonso. His other roles at the Met included Alfredo, Anatol in Barber's "Vanessa", Arbace, Belmonte, Don Carlos, Cassio in "Otello", Cavaradossi in "Tosca", Des Grieux in "Manon", Des Grieux in "Manon Lescaut", the Duke of Mantua, Edgardo, Eisenstein in "Die Fledermaus", Elvino in "La Sonnambula", Faust, Goffredo in "Rinaldo", Grigory in "Boris Godunov", Fernando in "La favorita", Hoffmann, the Italian Singer in "Der Rosenkavalier", Kodanda in Menotti's "The Last Savage", Lensky in "Eugene Onegin", Lionel in "Martha", the title role in "Lohengrin", Maurizio in "Adriana Lecouvreur", Narraboth in Strauss's "Salome", Pinkerton, Pollione in "Norma", Riccardo in "Un ballo in maschera", Rodolfo in "La bohème", Rodolfo in "Luisa Miller", Roland in "Esclarmonde", Tamino in "The Magic Flute", Tito in "La clemenza di Tito", Tonio in "La Fille du Régiment", and Walther von Stolzing in "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" among others.
During his long and distinguished career at the Met, Alexander sang opposite many famous artists, including the Met debuts of Renata Scotto (Pinkerton to her Butterfly), Montserrat Caballé (Faust to her Marguerite) and, in the same night as Caballé, Sherrill Milnes' (who portrayed Valentin). His last performance at the Met was on October 5, 1987 portraying Bacchus opposite Jessye Norman's Ariadne in "Ariadne auf Naxos".
Although Alexander worked mostly out of New York City he did occasionally travel to perform in other opera houses. In 1967 he made his debut with the San Francisco Opera as Julien in Gustave Charpentier's "Louise". He returned to that company a few more times during his career, singing Rodolfo (1969), Pollione (1972), and Hoffmann (1987). Also in 1967, Alexander sang the role of Paul in Korngold's "Die tote Stadt" for his first performance with the Vienna Volksoper. The following year he sang the role of Rodolfo in "La bohème" at the Vienna State Opera. In 1970 he made his Royal Opera House at Covent Garden debut as Pollione and in 1973 he sang for the first time with the Opera Company of Boston as the title role in Verdi's "Don Carlos". In 1975 he made his first appearance with the Opera Company of Philadelphia as Calaf in "Turandot" opposite Elinor Ross in the title role. He also performed in a few roles with the Berlin State Opera, the Bavarian State Opera, and the Cincinnati Opera. 
Alexander's relatively few performances outside of New York City was a conscious choice on his part. He chose to not travel in favor of having a stable life with his wife Sue and their daughter, Cindy. The family made their home on Long Island during the late 1950s through the early 1970s. At this point, Alexander joined the voice faculty at his alma mater in Cincinnati, Ohio. The family then relocated to Cincinnati while maintaining an apartment on the West Side of Manhattan for Alexander to use when he was in town for rehearsals and performances at the Met. 
In 1990 Alexander died suddenly of a heart attack at the Temple Theater in Meridian, Mississippi, the city where he was born. He was 67 years of age, and still actively performing and teaching at the time of his death.
Recordings.
Alexander may be seen on such videos as Mozart's "Idomeneo" (also starring Luciano Pavarotti, in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's production, 1982) and Donizetti's "Roberto Devereux" (with Beverly Sills and Susanne Marsee, in Tito Capobianco's production, 1975). His discography includes recordings of Bellini's "Norma" (with Dame Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne, 1964) and Donizetti's "Anna Bolena" (opposite Elena Souliotis, 1968–69). Additionally, VAI has released his 1967 performance, in New Orleans, of Massenet's "Manon", with Caballé and Louis Quilico.

Parable of the Invisible Gardener

The Parable of the Invisible Gardener is a tale told by John Wisdom. It was later developed in the university debate, by Antony Flew who made a few changes such as changing the gardeners to explorers. It is often used to illustrate the perceived differences between assertions based on faith and assertions based on scientific evidence, and the problems associated with unfalsifiable beliefs. The main point of the parable is that religious believers do not allow anybody to "falsify" their assertions, instead they simply change their beliefs to suit the questioner. This is why for Flew religious believers cause God to "Die the death of a thousand qualifications". The tale runs as follows:
"Two people return to their long neglected garden and find, among the weeds, that a few of the old plants are surprisingly vigorous. One says to the other, 'It must be that a gardener has been coming and doing something about these weeds.' The other disagrees and an argument ensues. They pitch their tents and set a watch. No gardener is ever seen. The believer wonders if there is an invisible gardener, so they patrol with bloodhounds but the bloodhounds never give a cry. Yet the believer remains unconvinced, and insists that the gardener is invisible, has no scent and gives no sound. The skeptic doesn't agree, and asks how a so-called invisible, intangible, elusive gardener differs from an imaginary gardener, or even no gardener at all."
In the later additions of Flew, there is the addition of infra-red, and cameras and the garden/clearing is surrounded by an electrified fence. The gardener therefore must not only be undetectable, but intangible.

Linda West

Linda West is a Canadian administrator, activist and politician. She is perhaps best known as an advocate for increased private health provision within Canada's public health system. She has been a candidate for the Conservative Party of Canada and the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba.
Private life and career.
West has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Laurentian University and a Master of Business Administration specializing in Health Care from the University of Toronto. She also holds a Ph.D. from Washington International University, an institution that is licensed but not accredited by any educational oversight body in Canada or the United States of America. West's Ph.D. credentials became a source of controversy during the 2006 federal election.
West was executive director of the James Bay General Hospital from 1992 to 1995, and of the Winnipeg River Health District from 1995 to 1997. From 1997 to 2000, she was executive director of labour relations for Manitoba Health. She has also been a health policy consultant for the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba, and has taught nursing and business at the University of Manitoba. West is the author of a book entitled, "Trends and Issues in Health Care". 
In 2003, West helped organize a conference in Winnipeg, Manitoba on the role of women in politics. She received a Women of Distinction Award from the Winnipeg YMCA-YWCA in 2004, and was later chosen as the local director of Equal Voice, a group that promotes the increased participation of women in political life. In 2006, she helped organize a rebuilding effort in New Orleans for Habitat For Humanity.
In July 2007, West was hired as executive director for employment services in the Regina Qu’Appelle Health Region's Human Resources Department. She was named acting vice-president of Human Resources in August of the same year, and became vice-president in December. West left employment with the Regina Qu’Appelle Health Region on 21 February 2008. West also became vice-president of Human Resources with a recruitment agency that provides Canadian placements to migrant workers from the Philippines, in 2007. She argued in 2008 that Canada needs overseas recruitment to counter a domestic labour shortage. 
Views on health delivery.
West has written several articles calling for Manitoba and Canada to develop new strategic plans for health care delivery. She believes that the Canada Health Act. West has written favourably of France and Sweden's combined public-private models, and has criticized the delivery system of the United States of America.
West and provincial Health Minister Dave Chomiak engaged in a public controversy over health care strategies in late 2001 and early 2002. In the same period, West argued that Manitobans should pay health-care premiums instead of paying for health expenses through general taxation.
Activist and political candidate.
West first ran for public office in the 2003 provincial election, as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party. She initially sought the party's nomination for Riel, but lost to former Member of the Legislative Assembly Shirley Render at a nomination meeting in late 2002. During the nomination contest, one PC insider suggested that West's views on private health care would be a liability for the party. 
West subsequently convened a public meeting on Manitoba's physician shortage, which was held at Winnipeg's Transcona Inn in early 2003. During the question and answer session, she announced that she was considering a candidacy in the division of Radission. The political overtones of this meeting were noted in a newspaper report, though West denied that it had been called for political purposes. She won the Radisson nomination, but lost to New Democratic Party candidate Bidhu Jha in the general election. 
West returned to writing opinion pieces on Canada's health-care system after the election. She reiterated her support for publicly funded private clinics, and criticized the provincial government's approach to the issue. She was also a vocal opponent of Winnipeg Mayor Glen Murray's tax policies, which she spoke against at several public meetings. 
The Manitoba Nurses' Union criticized West in late 2003, after she led a group of her own fourth-year undergraduate students in a rally outside the provincial legislature supporting an on-the-job training program. The students received 10% of their grade for participating in the rally, leading a union official to charge that West was manipulating the course for partisan ends. She denied this, and said that her students were taught to review both sides of the issue.
West was a supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada at the federal level, and supported its merger with the more right-wing Canadian Alliance to create the Conservative Party of Canada in 2003. She ran for the new party in the 2006 federal election, and finished second against New Democratic Party incumbent Bill Blaikie in Elmwood—Transcona.
West challenged Bidhu Jha a second time in the 2007 provincial election, initially centering her campaign around local opposition to a hog-processing plant planned for construction in the Radisson area. The NDP government withdrew its support for the project during the election, and indicated that the plant would not be built. Some NDP insiders nevertheless expressed concern that their early support for the unpopular project had made the seat vulnerable. On election day, however, Jha defeated West by an increased margin.

Cost Plus, Inc.

Cost Plus World Market is a chain of specialty/import retail stores, selling home furniture, decor, curtains, rugs, gifts, apparel, coffee, wine, craft beer, as well as several international food products. The brand's name originated from the initial concept, since abandoned, of selling items for "cost plus 10%". Its current headquarters are located in Oakland, California, in the Jack London District. The company has been a subsidiary of Bed Bath & Beyond since being acquired in 2012.
History.
Cost Plus opened its first store at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, California in 1958. Founder William Amthor discovered San Franciscans loved imported discount retail merchandise, when he sold some extra rattan furniture. Amthor operated a small family-owned furniture store in San Francisco at the time, but instead of displaying the rattan furniture in his store, he rented of warehouse space in the Fisherman's Wharf area of San Francisco. The rattan furniture sold quickly, convincing Amthor to start importing merchandise as a new business. He opened his first store devoted exclusively to imported merchandise later in 1958 and began importing wicker by the shipload.
After the success of this store, they quickly spread across the Bay Area and later into other states. There are currently 263 stores spread across 30 states.
In the 1990s, "Cost Plus" shifted the branding of its stores to either Cost Plus World Market or to simply World Market in markets new to the brand (generally in the Eastern or Southern regions of the USA). In 1996, Cost Plus World Market went public and began trading on the NASDAQ stock market.
In February 2006, Cost Plus reported quarterly earnings of $125 million, with $367 million in revenue for the 4th fiscal quarter of 2006. Their annual earnings were $280 million with over $800 million in revenue.
Cost Plus was acquired by Bed Bath & Beyond in 2012.
In 2014, Cost Plus World Market launched an online crowdsourcing-model marketplace called Craft by World Market. The website will post items for one month at a time, and sell only products that have a certain number of pre-orders to ensure enough customers will buy them.

Sevai is called santhakai in the western parts of Tamil Nadu; it is called "shavige" in Kannada. People also loosely use the terms idiappam and semiya (vermicelli) for Sevai, even though these foods are different from Sevai in several aspects. In Tamil, these are written சந்தகை, சந்தவம், சந்தவை.
Foods prepared with Sevai.
Shyavige can be made into a breakfast dish in Karnataka when cooked with vegetables and tempered with spices with a dash of lemon juice or a sweet dish called Payasam when cooked in milk with cardamom or other select spices and sugar. In the Malnad region of Karnataka rice shyaavige may be served with chicken curry. The other variants made with Ragi or Jowar are served plain with accompaniments like sweetened coconut milk and various edible powders that include powdered chickpea and sesame. In Tamil Nadu santhakai is often flavoured with lemon, tamarind, tomato, coconut, curd etc. and is usually eaten warm. Popular accompaniments for plain sevai are sweetened coconut milk, banana sugar and ghee, more-kuzhambu, several vegetable kormas and mutton, chicken, or fish korma.

Anna Bay, New South Wales

Anna Bay is the name of a suburb, a town and a bay in the Port Stephens local government area in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. The suburb and town are immediately adjacent to the north-eastern end of Stockton Beach and the town provides one of the major entry points to the beach here. Both were named after the bay of the same name which is now located in the adjacent suburb of One Mile.
During World War II Stockton Beach was heavily fortified against a possible amphibious assault by Imperial Japanese forces and a line of tank traps was installed to prevent entry to the local area through the town. Many of the tank traps were removed after the war and now feature significantly around the car parking areas at the beach.

Custom Floor

Custom Floor is an underground indie rock band that was formed in 1991 in San Diego, California by Garry Davis, Phil Esbenshade. and Miki Vuckovich. Although Garry and Phil were former pro skateboarders, Custom Floor was never a skate rock band, instead displaying a heavy Sonic Youth influence. They've described their music as, "a large dose of guitar, bass and drums-based rock all big banged out into a wide array of minor notes, ringing octaves, heavy distortion, hovering harmonics, cymbal crashes, drum splashes and big-britches bass throb."
History.
Custom Floor released their first seven-inch record on Goldenrod Records in late 1991, and started playing frequent live shows throughout Southern California in 1992-'93. The first Custom Floor LP, "Clear Day", was released in December 1993 on their own Analog Sound Recordings label, and was supported with a full U.S. tour in Summer 1994—the second half of which was spent opening for fellow San Diegans Drive Like Jehu.
After the original Custom Floor line-up fizzled out in late 1992, numerous other San Diego musicians enjoyed brief stints in the band with leader Garry Davis in the mid-to-late '90s, including Tod Swank (bass), Brent Fellows (bass), Adam Willard of Rocket From The Crypt (drums), Michelle Slater (bass), Chris Squire (bass), Rafter Roberts (drums) and Matt Crane (drums). Garry released an experimental Custom Floor seven-inch called "The Handsome Young Airforce Lieutenant" with Adam Willard in 1995, then teamed up with Matt Crane and Chris Squire to record the band's second full-length CD, "From a Body", in 1997. 
A hiatus of several years then ensued, after which Garry and Matt recorded the band's third full-length, "A Distant Dull", in 2005. Custom Floor still exists today as a studio recording entity only, having played their last live show in 2000. Garry and Matt also occasionally play free improvisation and spontaneous rock music with various side musicians under the offshoot name Carpet Floor, who released four CDs—Majestic, Hovering Pillows, Mass Ejection and Blow Out—on August 2, 2007.

History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe

The presence of German-speaking populations in Central and Eastern Europe is rooted in centuries of history, with the settling in northeastern Europe of Germanic peoples predating even the founding of the Roman Empire. The presence of the independent German states in the region (particularly Prussia), and later the German Empire but also in other multi-ethnic countries, such as Austria-Hungary, Poland, Imperial Russia, etc., demonstrates the extent and duration of German-speaking settlements. In the German language, the German populations in these parts of Europe are commonly referred to as "Volksdeutsche". The number of ethnic Germans in Central and Eastern Europe dropped dramatically as the result of the German flight and expulsion from Central and Eastern Europe. However, there are still a substantial number of ethnic Germans in the countries that are now Germany and Austria's neighbors to the east—Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Slovenia. In addition, there are or have been significant populations in such areas as Estonia, Latvia, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan. 
Early Middle Ages settlement area.
In the early Middle Ages, Charlemagne had subdued a variety of Germanic peoples in Central Europe dwelling in an area roughly bordered by the Alps in the South, the Vosges Mountains in the West, the North Sea and Elbe River in the North and the Saale River in the East. These inhomogeneous Germanic peoples comprised several tribes and groups who either formed, stayed or migrated into this area during the Migration Period. After the Carolingian Empire was divided, these people found themselves in the eastern part, known as East Francia or "Regnum Teutonicum", and over time became known as Germans. The area was divided into the stem duchies of Swabia (Alamannia), Franconia, Saxony and Bavaria (including Carinthia). Later, the Holy Roman Empire would be constituted largely, but not exclusively of these regions.
Medieval settlements (Ostsiedlung).
The medieval German "Ostsiedlung" (literally "Settlement in the East"), also known as the "German eastward expansion" or "East colonization" refers to the expansion of German culture, language, states, and settlements to vast regions of Northeastern, East Central and Eastern Europe, previously inhabited since the Great Migrations by Balts, Romanians, Hungarians and, since about the 6th century, the Slavs. The affected territory stretched roughly from modern Estonia in the North to modern Slovenia in the South. 
Population growth during the High Middle Ages stimulated the movement of peoples from the Rhenish, Flemish, and Saxon territories of the Holy Roman Empire eastwards into the less-populated Baltic region and Poland. These movements were supported by the German nobility, the Slavic kings and dukes, and the medieval Church. The majority of this settlement was peaceful, although it sometimes took place at the expense of Slavs and pagan Balts (see Northern Crusades). "Ostsiedlung" accelerated along the Baltic with the advent of the Teutonic Order. Likewise, in Styria and Carinthia, German communities took form in areas inhabited by Slovenes. 
In the middle of the 14th century, the settling progress slowed as a result of the Black Death; in addition, the most arable and promising regions were largely occupied. Local Slavic leaders in late Medieval Pomerania and Silesia continued inviting German settlers to their territories. 
In the outcome, all previously Wendish territory were settled by a German majority and the Wends were almost completely assimilated. In areas further east, substantial German minorities were established, which either kept their customs or were assimilated by the host population. The density of villages and towns increased dramatically. German town law was introduced to most towns of the area, regardless of the percentage of German inhabitants.
Areas settled during Ostsiedlung.
The following areas saw German settlement during the Ostsiedlung:
German-run enterprises resulting in German settlements.
Hanseatic League.
Between the 13th and 17th centuries, trade in the Baltic Sea and Eastern Central Europe became dominated by Germans through the Hanseatic League (). The league was a Low-German-speaking military alliance of trading guilds that established and maintained a trade monopoly over the Baltic and to a certain extent the North Sea. Hanseatic towns and trade stations usually hosted relatively large German populations, with merchant dynasties being the wealthiest and political dominant fractions.
Teutonic Knights.
From the second half of the 13th century to the 15th century, the crusading Teutonic Knights ruled Prussia through their monastic state. As a consequence, German settlement accelerated along the southeastern coast of the Baltic Sea. These areas, centered around Gdansk (Danzig) and Königsberg, remained one of the largest closed German settlement area outside the Holy Roman Empire and would only be included in the German Empire as East and West Prussia in 1871.
17th to 19th century settlements.
Thirty Years' War aftermath.
When the Thirty Years' War devastated Central Europe, many areas were completely deserted, others suffered severe population drops. These areas were in part resettled by Germans from areas hit less. Some of the deserted villages, however, were not repopulated - that is why the Middle Ages' density of settlements was higher than today's.
Poland.
In the 16th and 17th centuries, settlers from the Netherlands and Friesland, often of Mennonite faith, founded villages in Royal Prussia, along the Vistula River and its tributaries, and in Kujawy, Mazovia and Wielkopolska. The law under which these villages were organized was called the Dutch or "Olęder" law; such villages were called "Holendry" or "Olędry." The inhabitants of such villages were called Olędrzy, regardless of their ethnicity. In fact, the vast majority of Olęder villages in Poland were settled by ethnic Germans, usually Lutherans, who spoke the Low German dialect called Plautdietsch.
Danube Swabians of Hungary and the Balkans.
With the decline of the Ottoman Empire, German settlers were called into devastated areas of Hungary, by then comprising a larger area than today, in the late 17th century. The Danube Swabians settled in Swabian Turkey and other areas, more settlers were called in even throughout the 18th century, in part to secure Hungary's frontier with the Ottomans. The Banat Swabians and Satu Mare Swabians are examples of Danube Swabian settlers from the 18th century. 
An influx of Danube Swabians also occurred toward the adriatic coast in what would later become Yugoslavia.
Settlers from Salzkammergut were called into Transsylvania to repopulate areas devastated by the wars with the Turks. They became known as Transylvanian Landler.
Russian Empire.
Since 1762, Russia called in German settlers. Some settled the Volga area northwest of Kazakhstan and therefore became known as Volga Germans. Others settled toward the coast of the Black Sea (Black Sea Germans, including Bessarabia Germans, Dobrujan Germans and Crimea Germans) and the Caucasus area (Caucasus Germans). These settlements occurred throughout the late 18th and the 19th centuries. 
In the late 19th century, many Vistula Germans (or Olędrzy) immigrated to Volhynia, as did descendants of early Mennonite settlers, whose ancestors had lived in West Prussia since the Ostsiedlung. Prussia imposed heavy taxes due to their pacifist beliefs. In Russia, they became hence known as Russian Mennonites.
According to the 1926 (1939) census, there were 1,238,000 (1,424,000) Germans living in the Soviet Union, respectively.
Turkey.
Since the 1840s, Germans moved to Turkey who by then had become an ally of the German Empire. Those settling in the Istanbul area became known as Bosporus Germans.
1871-1914.
By the 19th century, every city of even modest size as far east as Russia had a German quarter and a Jewish quarter. Travellers along any road would pass through, for example, a German village, then a Czech village, then a Polish village, etc., depending on the region.
Certain parts of Eastern Europe, especially those close to the border of Germany contained areas in which ethnic Germans constituted a majority.
German Empire and European nationalism.
The latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century saw the rise of nationalism in Europe. Previously, a country consisted largely of whatever peoples lived on the land that was under the dominion of a particular ruler. Thus, as principalities and kingdoms grew through conquest and marriage, a ruler could wind up with peoples of many different ethnicities under his dominion.
The concept of nationalism was based on the idea of a "people" who shared a common bond through race, religion, language and culture. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each "people" had a right to its own nation. Thus, much of European history in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of "one people, one nation". 
In 1871, the German Empire was founded, partly as a German nation-state. This is closely associated with chancellor Otto von Bismarck. While the empire included German settled Prussian regions formerly outside of its predecessors, it also included areas with Danish, Kashub and other minorities. In some areas, such as the Province of Posen or the southern part of Upper Silesia, the majority of the population were Poles. On the other hand, ethnic German Austria remained outside the empire, and so did many German-settled or mixed regions of Eastern and Central Europe. Most German settled regions of South Central and Southeastern Europe were instead included in the multi-ethnic Habsburg monarchy of Austria-Hungary.
Ostflucht.
Starting in the late 19th century, an inner-Prussian migration took place from the very rural eastern to the prospering urban western provinces of Prussia (notably to the Ruhr area and Cologne), a phenomenon termed Ostflucht. As a consequence, these migrations increased the percentage of the Polish population in Posen and West Prussia. Driven by nationalist intentions, the Prussian state established a Settlement Commission as countermeasure, that was to settle more Germans in these regions. In total 21,886 families (154,704 people) out of planned 40,000 were settled by the end of its existence.
The history of the forced expulsions of the Polish population is further explored in the Expulsion of Poles by Germany.
1914-1939.
World War I.
By World War I, there were isolated groups of Germans as far southeast as the Bosporus (Turkey), Georgia, and Azerbaijan. After the war, Germany's and Austria-Hungary's loss of territory meant that more Germans than ever were minorities in various countries, the treatment they received varied from country to country, and they were, in places subject to resentful persecution from former enemies of Germany. Perceptions of this persecution filtered back into Germany, where reports were exploited and amplified by the Nazi party as part of their drive to national popularity as savior of the German people.
The advance of allied German Empire and Habsburg monarchy forces into the Russian Empire's territory triggered actions of flight, evacuation and deportation of the population living in or near the combat zone. Russian Germans became subject to severe measures because of their ethnicity, including forced resettlement and deportation to Russia's East, ban of German language from public life (including books and newspapers), and denial of economical means (jobs and land property) based on "liquidation laws" issued since 1915; also Germans (as well as the rest of the population) were hit by "burned soil" tactics of the retreating Russians. About 300,000 Russian Germans became subject to deportations to Siberia and the Bashkir steppe, of those 70,000-200,000 were Germans from Volhynia, 20,000 were Germans from Podolia, 10,000 were Germans from the Kiev area, and another 11,000 were Germans from the Chernihiv area.
From Russian areas controlled by the German, Austrian and Hungarian forces, large scale resettlements of Germans to these areas were organized by "Fürsorgeverein" ("Welfare Union"), resettling 60,000 Russian Germans, and "Deutsche Arbeiterzentrale" ("German Workers' Bureau"), resettling 25,000-40,000 Russian Germans. Two thirds of these persons were resettled to East Prussia, most of the remaining in the northeastern provinces of Prussia and Mecklenburg.
Danzig and the Polish corridor.
When Poland regained its independence after World War I, the Poles hoped to regain the city of Danzig to provide the free access to the sea which they had been promised by the Allies on the basis of Woodrow Wilson's "Fourteen Points". However, since the population of the city was predominantly German, it was not placed under Polish sovereignty, but became the Free City of Danzig, an independent quasi-state under the auspices of the League of Nations, governed by its German residents but with its external affairs largely under Polish control. The Free City had its own constitution, national anthem, parliament ("Volkstag"), and government ("Senat"). It issued its own stamps and currency, bearing the legend ""Freie Stadt Danzig"" and symbols of the city's maritime orientation and history.
From the Polish Corridor, many ethnic Germans were forced to leave throughout the 1920s and 1930s, while Poles settled in the region building the sea port city Gdynia (Gdingen) next to Danzig. 
The vast majority of Danzig's population favoured eventual return to Germany. In the early 1930s the Nazi Party capitalized on these pro-German sentiments, and in 1933 garnered 38 percent of vote for the Danzig "Volkstag". Thereafter, the Nazis under the Bavaria-born Gauleiter Albert Forster achieved dominance in the city government - which, nominally, was still overseen by the League of Nations' High Commissioner.
Nazi demands, at their minimum, would have seen the return of Danzig to Germany and a one kilometer, state-controlled route for easier access across the Polish Corridor, from Pomerania to Danzig (and from there to East Prussia). Originally, the Poles had rejected this proposal, but later appeared willing to negotiate (as did the British) by August. By this time, however, Hitler had Soviet backing and had decided to attack Poland. Germany feigned an interest in diplomacy (delaying the "Case White" deadline twice), to try to drive a wedge between Britain and Poland.
Nazi claims to "Lebensraum" and resettlements of Germans before the war.
In the 19th century, the rise of romantic nationalism in Germany had led to the concepts of Pan-Germanism and Drang nach Osten, which in part gave rise to the concept of Lebensraum.
German nationalists used the existence of large German minorities in other countries as a basis for territorial claims. Many of the propaganda themes of the Nazi regime against Czechoslovakia and Poland claimed that the ethnic Germans ("Volksdeutsche") in those territories were persecuted. There were many incidents of persecution of Germans in the interwar period, including the French invasion of Germany proper in the 1920s. The German state was weak until 1933 and could not even protect itself under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The status of ethnic Germans, and the lack of contiguity of German majority lands resulted in numerous repatriation pacts whereby the German authorities would organize population transfers (especially the Nazi-Soviet population transfers arranged between Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, and others with Benito Mussolini's Italy) so that both Germany and the other country would increase their homogeneity. 
However, these population transfers were considered but a drop in the pond, and the "Heim ins Reich" rhetoric over the continued disjoint status of enclaves such as Danzig and Königsberg was an agitating factor in the politics leading up to World War II, and is considered by many to be among the major causes of Nazi aggressiveness and thus the war. Adolf Hitler used these issues as a pretext for waging wars of aggression against Czechoslovakia and Poland.
Nazi settlement concepts during World War II (1939–45).
The status of ethnic Germans, and the lack of contiguity resulted in numerous repatriation pacts whereby the German authorities would organize population transfers (especially the Nazi–Soviet population transfers arranged between Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, and others with Benito Mussolini's Italy) so that both Germany and the other country would increase their "ethnic homogeneity".
Resettlement of Germans from the Baltic States and Bessarabia.
German populations affected by the population exchanges were primarily the Baltic Germans and Bessarabia Germans and others who were forced to resettle west of the Curzon Line. The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact had defined "spheres of interest", assigning the states between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to either one of those. 
Except for Memelland, the Baltic states were assigned to the Soviet Union, and Germany started pulling out the Volksdeutsche population after reaching respective agreements with Estonia and Latvia in October 1939. The Baltic Germans were to be resettled in occupied Poland and compensated for their losses with confiscated property at their new settlements. Though resettlement was voluntary, most Germans followed the call because they feared repression once the Soviets would move in. Eventually, this actually happened to the ones who stayed. The Baltic Germans were moved to Germany's northeastern port cities by ship. Poles were expelled from West Prussia to make space available for resettlement, but due to quarrels with the Gauleiter Albert Forster, resettlement stalled and further "repatriants" were moved to Posen.
Resettlement of Germans from Italy.
On October 6, 1939, Hitler announced a resettlement program for the German-speaking population of the Italian province of South Tyrol. With an initial thought to resettle the population in occupied Poland or the Crimea, they were actually moved to places in nearby Austria and Bavaria. Also affected were German speakers from other areas in northern Italy, like the Kanaltal and Grödnertal valleys. Resettlement stopped with the collapse of Mussolini's regime and the subsequent occupation of Italy by Nazi Germany.
German "Volksdeutsche" in Nazi-occupied Europe.
The actions of Germany ultimately had extremely negative consequences for most ethnic Germans in Central and Eastern Europe (termed Volksdeutsche to distinguish them from Germans from within the Third Reich, the Reichsdeutsche), who often fought on the side of the Nazi regime - some were drafted, others volunteered or worked through the paramilitary organisations such as Selbstschutz, which supported the German invasion of Poland and murdered tens of thousands of Poles. In places such as Yugoslavia, Germans were drafted by their country of residence, served loyally, and were even held as POWs by the Nazis, and yet later found themselves drafted again, this time by the Nazis after their takeover. Because it was technically not permissible to draft non-citizens, many ethnic Germans ended up being (oxymoronically) forcibly volunteered for the Waffen-SS. In general, those closest to Nazi Germany were the most involved in fighting for her, but the Germans in remote places like the Caucasus were likewise accused of collaboration.
German exodus after Nazi Germany's defeat.
The 20th century wars annihilated most Eastern and East Central European German settlements, and the remaining sparse pockets of settlement were subject to emigration to Germany in the late 20th century for economical reasons.
Evacuation, and flight of Germans during the end of World War II.
By late 1944, after the Soviet success of the Belorussian Offensive in August 1944, the Eastern Front became relatively stable. Romania and Bulgaria had been forced to surrender and declare war on Germany. The Germans had lost Budapest and most of the rest of Hungary. The plains of Poland were now open to the Soviet Red Army. Starting on January 12, 1945, the Red Army began the Vistula–Oder Offensive which was followed a day later by the start of the Red Army's East Prussian Offensive.
German populations in Eastern Europe took flight from the advancing Red Army, resulting in a great population shift. After the final Soviet offensives began in January, 1945, hundreds of thousands of German refugees, many of whom had fled to Danzig by foot from East Prussia (see evacuation of East Prussia), tried to escape through the city's port in a large-scale evacuation that employed hundreds of German cargo and passenger ships. Some of the ships were sunk by the Soviets, including the "Wilhelm Gustloff", after an evacuation was attempted at neighboring Gdynia. In the process, tens of thousands of refugees were killed. 
Cities such as Danzig also endured heavy Western Allied and Soviet bombardment. Those who survived and could not escape encountered the Red Army. On 30 March 1945, the Soviets captured the city and left it in ruins.[http://www.gdansk.pl/en/article.php?category=453&article=926&history=453:]
The Yalta Conference.
As it became evident that the Allies were going to defeat Nazi Germany decisively, the question arose as to how to redraw the borders of Eastern European countries after the war. In the context of those decisions, the problem arose of what to do about ethnic minorities within the redrawn borders.
The final decision to move Poland's boundary westward was made by the US, Britain and the Soviets at the Yalta Conference, shortly before the end of the war. The precise location of the border was left open; the western Allies also accepted in general the principle of the Oder River as the future western border of Poland and of population transfer as the way to prevent future border disputes. The open question was whether the border should follow the eastern or western Neisse rivers, and whether Stettin, the traditional seaport of Berlin, should remain German or be included in Poland. The western Allies sought to place the border on the eastern Neisse, but Stalin insisted that the border should be on the western Neisse. 
The Potsdam Conference.
At the Potsdam Conference the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union placed the German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line (Poland referred to by the Polish communist government as the "Western Territories" or "Recovered Territories") as formally under Polish administrative control. It was anticipated that a final peace treaty would follow shortly and either confirm this border or determine whatever alterations might be agreed upon. 
The final agreements in effect compensated Poland for 187,000 km² located east of the Curzon Line with 112,000 km² of former German territories. The northerneastern third of East Prussia was directly annexed by the Soviet Union and remains part of Russia to this day.
It was also decided that all Germans remaining in the new and old Polish territory should be expelled, to prevent any claims of minority rights. Among the provisions of the Potsdam Conference was a section that provided for the "orderly transfer of German populations". The specific wording of this section was as follows:
Expulsion of Germans after World War II.
The expulsion of Germans after World War II refers to the forced migration and ethnic cleansing of German nationals ("Reichsdeutsche") and ethnic Germans ("Volksdeutsche)" from the former eastern territories of Germany, former Sudetenland and other areas across Europe in the first five years after World War II. 
It was the largest of a number of expulsions in various Central and Eastern European countries affecting a number of nationalities. The Big Three had agreed on a policy of expulsions, and the Soviet Union implemented the policy with American and British acquiescence. The policy had been agreed on by the Allies as part of the reconfiguration of postwar Europe.
As the Red Army advanced towards Germany at the end of World War II, a considerable exodus of German refugees began from the areas near the front lines. Many Germans fled their areas of residence under vague and haphazardly implemented evacuation orders of the Nazi German government in 1943, 1944, and in early 1945, or based on their own decisions to leave in 1945 to 1948. Others remained and were later forced to leave by local authorities. Census figures in 1950 place the total number of ethnic Germans still living in Eastern Europe at approximately 2.6 million, about 12 percent of the pre-war total.
The majority of the flights and expulsions occurred in Czechoslovakia, Poland and the European Soviet Union. Others occurred in territories of northern Yugoslavia (predominantly in the Vojvodina region), and other regions of Central and Eastern Europe. 
The total number of the Germans expelled after the war will remain unknown, but was estimated by various scientific approaches. Most of the past research provided a combined estimate of 13.5-16.5 million people, including those that were evacuated by German authorities, fled or were killed during the war. However, recent research places the number at above 12 million, including all those who fled during the war or migrated later, forcibly or otherwise, to both the Western and Eastern zones of Germany and to Austria. 
Recent analyses have led some historians to conclude that the actual number of deaths attributable to the flight and expulsions was in the range of 500,000 to 1.1 million. The earlier higher figures, up to 3.2 million, typically include all war-related deaths of ethnic Germans between 1939–45, including those who served in the German armed forces.
When Romania signed a peace treaty with the Soviets in 1944, the German military began withdrawing the Transylvanian Saxons from Transylvania; this operation was most thorough with the Saxons of the Nösnerland. Around 100,000 Germans fled before the Soviet Red Army, but Romania did not conduct the expulsion of Germans as did neighboring countries at war's end. However, more than 80,000 Saxons were arrested by the Soviet Army and sent to labour camps in Siberia for alleged cooperation with Germany.
Most of those belonging to the Yugoslavian-German minority were interned at camps and eventually expelled from the country. The majority went to Austria and West Germany. However, there were a number of people who stayed, because they were married to local partners. These people and their descendants were no longer officially considered a part of the German population.
Recent history.
Expelled Germans in postwar Germany.
After World War II many expellees (German: "Heimatvertriebene") from the land east of the Oder-Neisse found refuge in both West Germany and East Germany. Refugees who had fled voluntarily but were later refused to return are often not distinguished from those who were forcibly deported, just as people born to German parents that moved into areas under German occupation either on their own or as Nazi colonists. 
In a document signed 50 years ago the "Heimatvertriebene" organisations have also recognized the plight of the different groups of people living in today's Poland who were by force resettled there. The Heimatvertriebene are just one of the groups of millions of other people, from many different countries, who all found refuge in today's Germany. 
Some of the expellees are active in politics and belong to the political right-wing. Many others do not belong to any organizations, but they continue to maintain what they call a lawful right to their homeland. The vast majority pledged to work peacefully towards that goal while rebuilding post-war Germany and Europe. 
The expellees are still highly active in German politics, and are one of the major political factions of the nation, with still around 2 million members. The president of their organization is as of 2004 still a member of the national parliament.
Although expellees (in German Heimatvertriebene) and their descendants were active in West German politics, the prevailing political climate within West Germany was that of atonement for Nazi actions. However, the CDU governments have shown considerable support for the expellees and German civilian victims.
Polish–German relations.
Relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany have generally been cordial since 1991.
Status of the German minority in Poland.
The remaining German minority in Poland (152,897 people according to the 2002 census) has minority rights on the basis of the Polish–German treaty and minority law. German parties are not subject to the 5% threshold during the Sejm elections so Germans are able to obtain two seats. There are German speakers throughout Poland, but only the voivodeship of Opole/Oppeln has a larger concentration.
Finalization of the Polish–German border.
For decades, the CDU-controlled German government considered the Oder–Neisse line to be completely unacceptable. Even the Social Democrats of the SPD initially refused to accept the Oder–Neisse line. The 1991 Polish–German border agreement finalized the Oder–Neisse line as the Polish–German border. The agreement gave to minority groups in both countries several rights, such as the right to use national surnames, speak their native languages, and attend schools and churches of their choice. These rights had been denied previously on the basis that the individual had already chosen the country in which they wanted to live.
Restricting sale of property to foreigners.
In November 2005 "Der Spiegel" published a poll from the Allensbach Institute which estimated that 61% of Poles believed Germans would try to get back territories that were formerly under German control or demand compensation.
There are also some worries among Poles that rich descendants of the expelled Germans would buy the land the Polish state confiscated in 1945. It is believed that this may result in large price increases, since the current Polish land price is relatively low. This led to Polish restrictions on the sale of property to foreigners, including Germans: special permission is needed. This policy is comparable to similar restrictions on the Baltic Åland Islands. These restrictions will be lifted 12 years after the 2004 accession of Poland to the European Union, i.e. on May 1, 2016. The restrictions are weak, they are not valid for companies and certain types of properties.
The attempts by German organisations to build a Centre Against Expulsions dedicated to German people's suffering during World War II has led Polish politicians and activists to propose a Center for Martyrology of Polish Nation (called also Center for the Memory of Suffering of the Polish Nation) that would document the systematical oppression conducted on Polish people by German state during World War II and which would serve to educate German people about atrocities their state and regime conducted on their neighbours. However, this proposal was attacked and rejected by German politicians.
German minority in the Czech Republic.
There are about 40,000 Germans remaining in the Czech Republic. Their number has been consistently decreasing since World War II. According to the 2001 census there remain 13 municipalities and settlements in the Czech Republic with more than 10% Germans.
The situation in Slovakia was different from that in the Czech lands, in that the number of Germans was considerably lower and that the Germans from Slovakia were almost completely evacuated to German states as the Soviet army was moving west through Slovakia, and only the fraction of them that returned to Slovakia after the end of the war was deported together with the Germans from the Czech lands.
The Czech Republic has introduced a law in 2002 that guarantees the use of native minority languages (incl. German) as official languages in municipalities where autochthonous linguistic groups make up at least 10% of the population. Besides the use in dealings with officials and in courts the law also allows for bilingual signage and guarantees education in the native language.
Czech–German relations.
On 28 December 1989, Václav Havel, at that time a candidate for president of Czechoslovakia (he was elected one day later), suggested that Czechoslovakia should apologize for the expulsion of ethnic Germans after World War II. Most of other politicians of the country did not agree, and there was also no reply from leaders of Sudeten German organizations. Later, the German President Richard von Weizsäcker answered this by apologizing to Czechoslovakia during his visit to Prague on March 1990 after Václav Havel repeated his apology characterizing the expulsion as "the mistakes and sins of our fathers". However, the Beneš decrees continue to remain in force in Czechoslovakia.
In Czech–German relations, the topic has been effectively closed by the
Czech–German declaration of 1997. One principle of the declaration was that parties will not burden their relations with political and legal issues which stem from the past. 
However, some expelled Sudeten Germans or their descendants are demanding return of their former property, which was confiscated after the war. Several such cases have been taken to Czech courts. As confiscated estates usually have new inhabitants, some of whom have lived there for more than 50 years, attempts to return to a pre-war state may cause fear. The topic comes to life occasionally in Czech politics. Like in Poland, worries and restrictions concerning land purchases exist in the Czech Republic. According to a survey by the Allensbach Institut in November 2005, 38% of Czechs believe Germans want to regain territory they lost or will demand compensation.
German minority in Hungary.
Today the German minority in Hungary have minority rights, organisations, schools and local councils but spontaneous assimilation is well under way. Many of the deportees visited their old homes after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1990. In 2001, 62 105 people declared to be German and 88 209 people had affinity with cultural values, traditions of the German nationality.[http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/eng/volumes/18/tables/load1_31.html
German minority in Romania.
Numerous Romanian Germans have emigrated to Germany, especially after 1989, and are represented by the Landsmannschaft der Siebenbürger Sachsen in Deutschland. Due to this emigration from Romania the population of Germans in Romania is dwindling (359,109 in 1977 and only 60,088 in 2002). 
The Germans (Transylvanian Saxons, Banat Swabians, Sathmar Swabians, Bukovina Germans, Transylvanian Landler, Zipser Germans, and Regat Germans) remaining in Romania are represented by the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania.

Pierre-Marie Théas

Pierre-Marie Théas (born September 14, 1894 in Barzun, Pyrénées-Atlantiques-died on April 3, 1977,aged 82) was a French Roman Catholic bishop. Ordained a priest in 1920, he became Bishop of Montauban, in 1940, and later served as Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes. A significant figure in Catholic resistance to Nazism in France, he was recognised as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem for his efforts to protect Jews from the Nazi Holocaust.
Biography.
He was ordained on September 16, 1920 as a priest. He was consecrated as the Bishop of Montauban, France, on July 26, 1940. He was present at the last days of Spanish President Manuel Azaña, and offered support to his widow.
Resistance to Nazism.
When the Archbishop of Toulouse, Jules-Géraud Saliège, lead a powerful denunciation of the mistreatment of Jews in 1942, Théas joined other French bishops in denouncing the roundup of Jews for deportation to Nazi death camps. He wrote a pastoral letter condemning the Nazi deportation of Jews in the summer of 1942 in which he said: "I give voice to the outraged protest of Christian conscience and I proclaim… that all men, whatever their race or religion, have the right to be respected by individuals and by states." For his attempts to prevent the Jewish deportations and persecutions he was later honoured as "Righteous Among The Nations" by Yad Vashem.
The protest of the bishops is seen by various historians as a turning point in the formerly passive response of the Catholic Church in France. Marie-Rose Gineste transported a pastoral letter from Bishop Théas of Montauban by bicycle to forty parishes, denouncing the uprooting of men and women "treated as wild animals", and the French Resistance smuggled the text to London, where it was broadcast to France by the BBC, reaching tens of thousands of homes.
Théas continued to oppose the Nazi policies culminating in a fiery sermon in his cathedral in which he condemned the "Cruel and inhuman treatment of one of our fellow men" in 1944. He was arrested the night after the sermon by the Gestapo. He was sent to a concentration camp where he spent 10 weeks and then was released and returned to his parish.
Post-war.
After the war he was installed as the Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes on February 17, 1947 and retired on February 12, 1970.
He was most noted for his belief in Liberation Theology. He has been credited as saying:
He died on April 3, 1977.

Hooda made his Bollywood debut with Mira Nair's "Monsoon Wedding" in 2001. However, after a good performance in the film he waited four years for a second project: Ram Gopal Varma's "D" (2005), which earned him critical acclaim. After "D" Hooda worked on a series of unsuccessful projects until he featured in Milan Luthria's "Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai" (2010), which proved to be a turning point in his career. He was subsequently noted for his performances in "Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster" (2011) "Jannat 2" "Jism 2"(2012)and the most recent "Highway"
In addition to acting in film and theatre, Hooda regularly participates professionally in equestrian sports such as polo and show jumping. He is a social activist and a blogger. He's one of the celebrities quite active on the online social circuit through his verified facebook account www.facebook.com/TheLightOfWar
Early life and background.
Hooda was born Randeep Singh Hooda on 20 August 1976, in Rohtak, Haryana, to Dr. Ranbir Hooda (a surgeon) and Asha Hooda (a social worker). He also has an elder sister, Dr. Anjali Hooda Sangwan, a US-Trained Obesity Medicine Specialist and a younger brother, Sandeep Hooda, a Software Engineer working in Singapore.
Hooda belongs to a Jat family, As a child Hooda studied at the Motilal Nehru School of Sports (MNSS), a boarding school in Rai, Sonepat, Haryana. He was involved in swimming and equestrian sports (including tent pegging and show jumping) winning medals at the national level. Hooda later developed an interest in theatre and participated in school productions, directing one. In an interview with Rediff.com, he said that he loved appearing in front of people. However, his family wanted him to be a doctor and he was transferred to Delhi Public School, R. K. Puram in New Delhi. Hooda described the transition from an environment where he was popular to one in which he was unknown as "difficult". Instead of acting in school productions, he became mischievous to fit in with the other boys in his hostel. He later recalled, "If anybody had to skip school, leave school, get drinks, get their exam papers done by someone else, I was the guy who arranged all that ... I was a bit short-tempered and a bit frustrated in school so all that contributed the attitude."
After completing his schooling, Hooda moved to Melbourne in 1995 and received a bachelor's degree in marketing and a master's degree in business management and human resource management. During that period, he worked in a Chinese restaurant, a car-wash, waited tables and drove a taxi for two years. In 2000, Hooda returned to India and worked in the marketing department of an airline. He subsequently started modelling and working in amateur theatre in Delhi. While rehearsing for his first play he received a call from director Mira Nair, who wanted him to audition for a part.
Film career.
2001–09: Debut and struggle.
Hooda made his acting debut in Mira Nair's "Monsoon Wedding" (2001), playing a non-resident Indian from Australia. Although the film was a critical and commercial success, he waited four years for a second project. In the meanwhile, Hooda worked in theatre and did television commercials to support himself financially. He also attended (and assisted) an imagination and improvisation workshop conducted by Naseeruddin Shah at the National School of Drama in New Delhi.
In 2005 Hooda was cast as the male lead in Ram Gopal Varma's gritty gangster film "D", allegedly based on the life of Dawood Ibrahim. His performance in the film received positive reviews; Taran Adarsh wrote, "D wouldn't be what it is without Randeep. He changes his expressions like a chameleon changes colors and that's where he scores." After "D", Hooda appeared in a series of critically and commercially unsuccessful films such as "Darna Zaroori Hai" (2006), "Risk" (2007), "Ru Ba Ru" (2008), "Rang Rasiya" (2008), "Mere Khwabon Mein Jo Aaye" (2009), "Karma Aur Holi" (2009) and "Love Khichdi" (2009).
2010–present: Breakthrough.
In 2010 Hooda appeared in Milan Luthria's "Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai", a period action drama depicting the rise of organised crime in Mumbai. Co-starring alongside Ajay Devgan, Emraan Hashmi, Kangna Ranaut and Prachi Desai, Hooda played ACP Agnel Wilson. His performance in the film was appreciated by critics, and proved to be a turning point in his career. Sudish Kamath of "The Hindu" wrote, "In the few scenes he gets, Randeep chews the scenery around him with his Bachchan-like presence, his baritone firing away dialogue as if he were born to play this role." Komal Nahta described him as a "revelation". The film was a critical and commercial success, earning over in India. Hooda later attributed his success to this film: "Things have really changed for me professionally because before "Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai" I did take a hiatus from acting, but that film brought me back in a big way. Now other directors and production houses look at me as an actor who can carry bigger parts and a longer screen presence."
The following year, Hooda featured in Tigmanshu Dhulia's romantic thriller "Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster" with Jimmy Shergill and Mahie Gill. The film (and his portrayal of a gangster who falls in love with a married woman while working as her driver) earned rave reviews from critics. In an interview with "Digital Spy", Hooda said "My inspiration for this character went back to my roots in Haryana, to the time I grew up and people I observed. My uncles were drivers and I thought of those times and people around me." Nikhat Kazmi of "The Times of India" called him "absolutely mesmerising"; Garauv Malani wrote, "Randeep Hooda plays the best character of his career so far and gets immense scope to show his performance prowess. The passion, obsession, emotions and expressions he brings to his character is simply outstanding."
Hooda's first film in 2012 was Kunal Deshmukh's crime thriller "Jannat 2", a sequel to "Jannat" (2008). While the film received mixed reviews from critics, Hooda was praised for his performance. Taran Adarsh wrote, "the actor delivers yet another knockout performance. He dominates in several sequences, making you realize that if given an opportunity, the guy can steal the thunder from the best of actors." Sonia Chopra of Sify said, "Randeep Hooda is the best thing about the film." It was a commercial success, with a domestic revenue of over . Hooda's next appearance was in Pooja Bhatt's erotic thriller "Jism 2" opposite Sunny Leone. The film, and Hooda's performance, received mixed reviews from critics. Lisa Tsering of "The Hollywood Reporter" said that Hooda "smolders to the best of his ability in the role of a violent criminal" Rajeev Masand wrote, "The usually dependable Hooda, goes a little overboard with all the feeling; alternating clunkily between melancholic and hyper, Hooda constructs a wildly implausible character that inspires most of the unintended laughs in this film." "Jism 2" was a moderate commercial success, earning in India.
Hooda's final film of the year was Madhur Bhandarkar's drama "Heroine", starring Kareena Kapoor, in which he played cricketer Angad Paul. Before the start of principal photography, Arunoday Singh was chosen for the role but was dropped for unknown reasons. Media reports began speculating about several actors (such as Ranbir Kapoor, Imran Khan and Prateik Babbar), although Bhandarkar later confirmed that he selected Hooda after seeing his performance in "Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster" (2011). The film received mixed to negative reviews, but Hooda's performance was appreciated by the critics. Kanika Sikka of "Daily News and Analysis" wrote, "Randeep, as usual does justice to his role." The film was eventually declared a below-average grosser due to its poor performance at the domestic and international box offices.
In 2013, Hooda starred opposite Aditi Rao Hydari and Sara Loren in Vishesh Bhatt's "Murder 3", an official remake of the 2011 Colombian thriller "The Hidden Face". The film and his portrayal of Vikram (a fashion and wildlife photographer) garnered mixed to negative feedback from critics. A review from "Mint" said that Hooda "is hundreds of shades below his ability to enact a character." The film earned a worldwide gross of in ten days, and was an average grosser.
As of March 2013, Hooda featured in the anthology film "Bombay Talkies" (in the segment directed by Karan Johar) alongside Rani Mukerji and Saqib Saleem.
He has been signed for several other projects, including Vishram Sawant’s "Shooter", "John Day", "Fanne Khan", Rensil D’Silva’s "Ungli", Pooja Bhatt's "Bad", Imtiaz Ali's "Highway" and Sajid Nadiadwala's "Kick".
Other ventures.
Theatre.
Hooda has been associated with theatre since the beginning of his acting career, and is an active member of Naseeruddin Shah's Motley Theatre Troupe. In an interview with "Daily News and Analysis", he recalled "My first stint with theatre was in school, where I was asked to wear a lion mask and roar for several minutes. My parents came to see me with a lot of expectations and sadly, they couldn’t even recognise me on stage because of the mask." During his years in the film industry, Hooda has continued to participate in a number of theatrical productions. He said, "Juggling between the two and films does get difficult, but I don’t see myself ever give up theatre. It’s got a deeper connect with who I really am. So, if films give you the wings to fly, theatre is a reality check, it keeps you grounded. Films can give you the satisfaction of feeling like a hero, but theatre gives you the real satisfaction of being an actor." Hooda has appeared in "Kali Shalwar Aur Kuchchh Kahaniyan" (a play based on Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories), "To Teach His Own" and "Arms and The Man". He described the latter as a typical George Bernard Shaw play: "It is complete with elements to entertain an audience. It delves into true love, heroism and some confused relationships that are pretty baffling even in the current social structure." Hooda made his theatrical debut as a writer, adapting Lee Blessing’s "A Walk in the Woods" in an Indian context. Naseerudin Shah appeared, and Ratna Pathak directed the play.
Equestrian sports.
Hooda is the only Bollywood actor who regularly participates in professional equestrian sports, including polo and show jumping. He was coached by Colonel SS Ahalawat and Brigadier Bishnoi in show-jumping and dressage. Hooda described riding as his "passion": "My first stint with horses happened when I was in class eight at the Motilal Nehru School of Sports in Haryana, but thereafter I didn't ride horses for 17 years." He keeps six horses at the Mahalaxmi Racecourse in Mumbai. In an interview with "Deccan Herald", he explained "Jats take to horses like fish to water. My taking to polo in big way was only natural. Today, polo is not just restricted to the royalty and the Indian Army, many companies and firms too patronise the sport. The superb synchronisation between man and his horse, the amazing speed, the brute power with the backdrop of green arena makes polo the most exclusive and glorious sport of all requiring mental and physical strength. Even if you do not get the chance to play, there is every chance of being able to watch the sport as an observer—which is almost as good as playing. There is something extremely satisfying about watching men on their horses as they pursue the ball with their sticks with skill and adroitness." In December 2008, Hooda underwent surgery after suffering a severe ankle injury in a fall from his horse during a polo match in Mumbai. The following year, he won a silver medal at an open dressage event organised by the Equestrian Federation of India in Delhi. Hooda has also won medals at equestrian events in Mumbai and Delhi, where he participated with riders from the Indian Army.
Column-writing and blog.
In 2009 Hooda was a guest contributor to the "In The Script" column, published by "Asian Correspondent". His article, entitled "Racism against Indians in Australia..." discussed the violence against Indians in Australia controversy. Hooda shared his experience of living in Australia, during which he was subjected to racial discrimination, and how he handled the situation: "My experiences were not in my mind incidents of racial discrimination but more a challenge of individual assertion of mental and physical superiority." In conclusion, he wrote "The point is to get tough inside out, play a sport apart from cricket, have heart and stand up in unity and say “we’ll not take shit”. All it needs is a few pioneers and I’m proud to say that I tried will continue to do so and I hope a few others do that too." In 2011, Hooda began a blog in the "Hindustan Times" to interact with his fans and share his experiences.
Social activism.
In September 2010 Hooda and Jackky Bhagnani walked the ramp in a charity show for Khushi, Kapil Dev's NGO to improve poor communities in rural and urban areas of India. The following year, Hooda raised public awareness of chronic hunger in India. He presented a video to the cast and crew of "Jism 2", who shared it on their social-media accounts. In December 2012 Hooda participated in an anti-suicide initiative with Imtiaz Ali, Rahul Bose, Mahesh Bhupati and Nishikant Kamath, speaking to local students and parents. Hooda, who had failed Class 12, told the children not to give up. He said, "Don't accept defeat. Fight back adversities. Failure is a myth. Every experience is a just fodder for the future. Suicide doesn't solve the problem, It ends you."
Image and personal life.
Apart from his reputation as an intense actor, Hooda is also considered one of the most attractive celebrities in India due to his rugged good looks. In 2010, he ranked 21st in "The Times of India"s annual list of the 50 most desirable men of 2009. In 2011, a global online survey conducted by Internet Movie Database (IMDb) ranked him seventh on its list of the "20 sexiest men in the world". Although surprised and grateful, Hooda maintained that he is not swayed by such labels: "I want people to know me for my body of work, than just my body [...] Being sexy can always just be an added advantage, not the be-all and end-all for an actor." During an interview with "Mid Day", Hooda said that during his early years in the industry people saw him as an "explosive Jat boy" and had a calculated approach to him due to his attitude. He added, "Now, I'm a bit more careful. I've changed the way I express myself."
Having lived in a hostel from a young age, Hooda said "I've always had a good time, it's something that gives me my spirit and fuels my spirit as well. Now I want my parents to live with me, I want to enjoy their company more." Speaking about his parents (who live in Faridabad, Haryana), Hooda said that he shares a great relationship with them and their openness to everything has helped him in life. He considers Naseerudin Shah as his "mentor, friend and confidant": "He’s an inspiration and somebody who has helped nurtured me as an actor not necessarily my career but my craft. He’s also the one who opened my eyes to the world of acting."
Hooda was in a relationship with former Miss Universe and actress Sushmita Sen from 2004 to 2006. He later said that ending their relationship changed his career. "The break-up was the best thing that happened to me and I realised that I gave it too much time in my life. It freed my energy to do things for myself." Hooda owns a stray dog named Candy who, he says, energises his life. Hooda was dating Neetu Chandra since 2009 & separated later.

Philippine Supreme Council elections, 1897

On November 1, 1897, the Republic of Biak-na-Bato was established in the cave of Biak-na-Bato, San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan. A special election was called for the new Supreme Council to oversee the newly established government on November 2, 1897 in the Philippines. 
Pact of Biak-na-Bato.
On December 14, 1897, the Pact of Biak-na-Bato was signed. Under the pact, Aguinaldo agreed to end hostilities and to exile himself and the revolutionary leadership, in exchange for amnesty and cash 'indemnities' in the amount of 800,000 pesos. Aguinaldo took the money offered and, along with 34 other leaders of the rebellion, exiled himself in Hong Kong. The following were the officers of the Supreme Council that oversaw the pact. Emilio Aguinaldo was President and Mariano Trias, the Vice President. Other officials included Antonio Montenegro for Foreign Affairs, Isabelo Artacho for the Interior, Baldomero Aguinaldo for the Treasury, and Emiliano Riego de Dios for War.
However, thousands of other Katipuneros continued to fight the Revolution against Spain for a sovereign nation. Unlike Aguinaldo who came from a privileged background, the bulk of these fighters were peasants and workers who were not willing to settle for 'indemnities.'

Fullerton Cove is a rural suburb of the Port Stephens local government area in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia, located just north of Fern Bay and adjacent to Fullerton Cove, from which the suburb gets its name. At the 2011 census the population of Fullerton Cove was 300.
Like Fern Bay Fullerton Cove lies to the west of the Tasman Sea. Although the entire coastline is part of Stockton Beach there is no public access to the beach from Fullerton Cove. The only access in the suburb is via a private track, which is off-limits to the public, in a large sand mining development at the end of Coxs Lane. Sand tracks in this area provide best access to the wreck of the , a 53,000 tonne Norwegian bulk carrier that ran aground during a major storm on 26 May 1974 and which has since become an icon and landmark for the local area as well as being a popular destination for off-road enthusiasts driving along Stockton Beach.

East Kimberley Regional Airport

Officially known and signposted as East Kimberley Regional Airport , it is more commonly referred to locally as Kununurra Airport an airport in Kununurra, Western Australia. The airport is west of the town. Heavy wet seasons often result in this area being cut off from essential outside services and deliveries. The airport is a crucial piece of infrastructure which enables people and goods to enter or leave from the region and especially supports tourism and economic development.
In 2012, a major expansion of the airport was completed and opened to the public. Costing about AUD$8.68 Million, it effectively doubled the size of the facility. This now includes a dedicated arrivals hall with baggage carousel, enlarged check-in area and improved security for the enlarged departure lounge.
Airlines and destinations.
Charter airlines.
Due to the long distances involved in traveling across the Kimberley region, several air-tours are offered by various charter airlines not based in Kununurra, hopping across the north-west of Australia. Occasionally connecting some major eastern Australian cities directly with Kununurra and with some bus tour companies too, to avoid lengthy transfers in Darwin or Perth.
Statistics.
Kununurra Airport was ranked 47th in Australia for the number of revenue passengers served in financial year 2010-2011.

Thebleedingalarm

Thebleedingalarm is a band originally from Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada which formed in the summer of 2003. They disbanded in the summer of 2007.
History.
Thebleedingalarm, based out of Kelowna, British Columbia, quickly became a favourite band in the local music scene, often playing with contemporaries Stutterfly and Cry of the Afflicted.
The band released their first full-length album, "Beauty in Destruction" in 2005, and were soon after signed by Immortal Records.
After the first release of 'Beauty in Destruction', the band frequently toured throughout Western Canada until March 2006, when TheBleedingAlarm was invited to play Austin Texas' SouthbySouthwest Festival. Following SouthbySouthwest, TheBleedingAlarm was set to tour with band 'Six'. The tour started in Laguna Beach California, and was set to end in North Carolina. During the beginning of the Tour Six dropped off and left TheBleedingAlarm to headline the rest of the dates.
In April 2006 after a series of disagreements during the band's first American tour, TheBleedingAlarm had a band meeting in which they addressed singer Charles Furney's inconsistent singing. Charles had already been talking with good friend Jordan Chase to start the band Secret and Whisper. The meeting reportedly ended well, but the next morning Furney told the band he was hopping on a bus home, feeling that he had been mistreated.
Later that afternoon Jens, Kevin, Paul and Thomas parted ways with Charles. With the band deciding to end their tour and drive to New Jersey, and Charles heading back to Kelowna.
Once the band arrived in New Jersey they quickly recruited their friend, singer Scott Rainone from Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Rainone was still in High School but was encouraged from both friends and teachers alike to pursue this endeavour. Scott Flew out to New Jersey to meet up with the band and start rehearsing. The other members were very happy with Rainone, and they quickly got on to a cross-Canada tour with Warcon Enterprises artist Adair. The tour started in Vancouver British Columbia and ended in Windsor Ontario.
The band was very excited about their new singer, and decided to make Scott their permanent replacement for Charles.
"Beauty In Destruction" was re-released on June 13, 2006 to mainly positive reviews. The re-released album only receiving changes to its artwork. The band held their CD release party in New Jersey at the legendary 'Vintage Vinyl' Record Store. Later that night while meeting with the band and their Manager Sylvia Cunha, Drummer Thomas Karanasos unexpectedly stated that he would be quitting the band due to personal reasons.
After Thomas' departure, friend Ryan Miller filled in on drums for the band for 2 shows in New Jersey, before being replaced by Kenrick Joshua Jr.
Soon after Williams joined TheBleedingAlarm they appeared twice on the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, playing in Vancouver and Calgary.
In August 2006, TBA shot a video in Kamloops British Columbia for their Single 'Sorrow's The Seas of my Heart'. The video was then put on Fuse On-demand, and has received a small amount of rotation on Canada's 'Much Music'.
After completing one tour Kenrick Joshua Jr. left the group.
This brought in long time friend, drummer Tim Morgan. Tim was asked to join the band in his first semester of the 12th grade. Tim agreed, and completed his high school diploma while on tour.
TheBleedingAlarm was now made up of Jens Madsen(Lead Guitar), Scott Rainon(Vocals), Kevin Moore(Rhythm Guitar), Paul Madsen(Bass) and Tim Morgan(Drums). They toured through the fall of 2006 and stopped for the year in early December. It was during this break that Rhythm Guitarist Kevin Moore decided that he would be quiting the band. Rumors began to circulate that TheBleedingAlarm had broken up, but quickly ceased with the addition of guitarist Chris Colon. The band rehearsed extensively with Colon, and in February 2007 began touring with fellow Immortal Records band A Change of Pace and Tooth and Nail Recording Artist The Classic Crime.
The band has seen numerous member changes throughout its lifetime, with Jens Madsen being the only remaining original member.
Having not toured since April 2007, thebleedingalarm has gone on indefinite hiatus.

Workplace

The workplace is the physical location where someone works. Such a place can range from a home office to a large office building or factory. The workplace is one of the most important social spaces other than the home, constituting "a central concept for several entities: the worker and his/her family, the employing organization, the customers of the organization, and the society as a whole". The development of new communication technologies have led to the development of the virtual workplace, a workplace that is not located in any one physical space.

Bois-des-Filion, Quebec

Bois-des-Filion is an off-island suburb of Montreal, located in Quebec, Canada, to the north of Montreal.
Historically, hundreds of families annually traveled to this region seasonally to experience the magnificent maple forests; however the tourist industry is currently a minor source of income for the city.
The primary language spoken by its citizens is French, and the primary source of employment is general manufacturing.
Origin of the name.
The name "Filion" is derived from the surname of Antoine Feuillon, a local carpenter who could neither read nor write, and thus was unable to correct any errors in the spelling of his name as the first records were kept. Antoine Feuillion was the son of Michel Feuillon, a captain of the musketeers during the reign of the "Sun King", Louis XIV before his immigration to the colony of Quebec.
This town is named "Bois" des Filion because of the beautiful maple woods bordering it — "le bois" being French for "the woods". When the city was newly founded, one had to follow a path through these woods and ford a small river to enter the city.
History.
This small town has a rich cultural history rooted in the legend of the lords, Celoron de Blainville and Lepage of Holy-Claire. Below are some important dates.

Ilgachuz Range

The Ilgachuz Range is a name given to an extinct shield volcano in British Columbia, Canada. It is not a mountain range in the normal sense, because it was formed as a single volcano that has been eroded for the past 5 million years. It lies on the Chilcotin Plateau, located some north-northwest of Vancouver and 30 km north of Anahim Lake. The highest peak of the range is Far Mountain. The range supports a unique grassland ecosystem. This type of grassland has not been seen anywhere else in central and southern British Columbia. The climate is cool and dry; typical of higher elevations of the Interior Plateau.
The long West Road River rises in the Ilgachuz Range and flows east to its confluence with the Fraser River between Prince George and Quesnel. It drains an area of approximately 12,000 km2, and dropping over 900 m before joining with the Fraser.
Geology and history.
Origins.
The Ilgachuz Range began erupting about 5 million years ago and has grown steadily since then. Like all of the Anahim volcanoes, the Ilgachuz Range has its origins in the Anahim hotspot—a plume of magma rising from the Earth's mantle in central British Columbia. The hotspot remains in a fixed position, while the North American Plate drifts over it at a rate of 2 to 3.3 centimetres per year. The upwelling of the hot magma creates volcanoes, and each individual volcano erupts for a few million years before the movement of the plate carries it away from the rising magma. However, where hotspots occur under continental crust, basaltic magma is trapped in the less dense continental crust, which is heated and melts to form rhyolites. These rhyolites can be quite hot and form violent eruptions, despite their low water content.
The hotspot has existed for at least 13 million years, and the Anahim Volcanic Belt stretches almost away from the hotspot. More recently, the hotspot has formed the Itcha Range and Nazko Cone, a cinder cone east of the Ilgachuz Range and the youngest Anahim volcano. The Ilgachuz Range is the largest of these, although the Rainbow Range is the largest of all volcanoes in the Anahim Volcanic Belt.
First Nations.
The first recorded ascent of the Ilgachuz Range was by the South Carrier and Chilcotin tribes. They have lived in the area for hundreds of years, travelling when necessary to hunt and trap animals such as beaver, caribou, moose, and to gather plants and roots. Fishing camps were also established in the area.
The Ilgachuz Range is, or was, an important source of obsidian for the South Carrier and Chilcotin tribes. Obsidian was greatly desired because very sharp arrowheads and cutting knives could be made from it. Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, creating razorlike edges. It was also used for jewelry. Anahim obsidian was traded extensively throughout the BC Interior and up and down the Coast from Bella Coola. Red ochre used in paint and decoration was also obtained from this area.
Structure.
The Ilgachuz Range is the second largest shield volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt which includes other immediately nearby ranges, the Rainbow Range and Itcha Range. It stands at above sea level - slightly shorter than its neighbor, Rainbow Range. It has a diameter of . The Ilgachuz Range was created by two chemically separate magmatic periods; an early complex series of trachyte and rhyolite eruptions, and late extrusion of a sequence of basaltic lava flows. Evacuation of the volcano's magma chamber resulted in the failure of one or more centrally located calderas. It is divided into Precaldera, Dome Forming, Intra Caldera and Shield Forming assembages.
The Precaldera Assemblage is best exposed on the east side of Pipe Organ Mountain where it contains a bedded pile over 300 m thick of weakly consolidated, moderately to extremely different, pyroclastics, flows and deposits of uncertain origin. Colours range from mottled green to grey, yellow, ochre, red and white. A green tuffbreccia composed of pumice fragments, feldspar crystals and minor debris is recognizable in several areas. 
The Dome Forming Assemblages include most of the rhyolite domes, related flows and the Ilgachuz Comendite. The northerly domes are subcircular talus mounds of plate sized pieces of light to dark grey, slightly porphyritic, flowbanded rhyolite with minor obsidian. Massive to banded chalcedony blobs and veinlets are related with these domes. The southern domes are somewhat different in nature, comprising intrusive and extrusive phases of cream colored porphyries. The Sax Dome contains an upper portion of cream coloured, aphanitic to fine quartz porphyry felsite with abnormal green glass filled fractures, and a lower unit of microsyenite with red and green glassy zenocrysts.
The Intra Caldera Assemblage is best exposed on the north edge of the caldera. The lower unit, indicative of caldera formation, is an epiclastic boulder-landslide deposit, roughly bedded and dipping into the caldera. Similar material, grading up into finer debris flows and possibly lahars, has been uncertainly known in the gap between Phacelia Peak and Calliope Mountain suggesting this area is the southern edge of the caldera. Alternatively, largely unsorted breccia and debris deposits exist on the ridge north of Saxifraga Peak, possibly indicating the main, or a subsidiary, caldera edge.
The Shield Forming Assemblage contains a series of basalt and minor comendite eruptions, and is best exposed on Far Mountain and Mount Scot. The basalts issued from fissure vents primarily located peripheral to the calderas. Brick red cinder deposits are considered to be a late phase of this assemblage.
Provincial Park.
Surrounding and including the range is Itcha Ilgachuz Provincial Park, a 112,000 hectare park of unique landscape in the West Chilcotin Uplands while the Rainbow Range lies partly in the Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park. The park includes volcanic landforms, alpine environments, and forest sites scattered with wetlands.
Itcha Ilgachuz Provincial Park is extremely remote and unroaded; the closest communities are Anahim Lake, Alexis Creek, Nimpo Lake, Redstone, and Nazko. The closest major centre is Quesnel, located approximately 200 km east of the park.
Subsidiary peaks.

Seventeenth Summer

Seventeenth Summer is a novel written by Maureen Daly and published in 1942. Daly was born in Ireland but grew up in Wisconsin. Before writing "Seventeenth Summer" she wrote a short story entitled "Sixteen". Daly began writing the novel when she was 17. After graduation from high school Daly attended Rosary College in River Forest, Illinois. She wrote all of her life as well as her three sisters. Maureen Daly died in 2006.
Plot summary.
Seventeenth Summer is a book about a 17-year-old girl named Angeline "Angie" Morrow. It takes place in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Angie gets asked out on her first date by the local high school's basketball star, Jack Duluth, 18. They fall in love but soon the summer will end, for Angie has to go to college in Chicago, and Jack is going back to his home in Oklahoma to help his uncle with the bakery business. Jack falls in love with Angie, but Angie never says that she loves him back, so the question is, does she? The novel ends with Angie leaving for college and the two have a heartfelt goodbye.
Themes.
The main theme of course is the love of Jack and Angie. The growth of the love is represented by the growth of plants in the novel. At the beginning of the summer Daly describes everything as lush and green. By the time Jack and Angie's last day comes around the frost is coming in to kill the tomatoes. The love has a distinct beginning at the start of summer and a distinct death at the end of summer.
There is also a theme of propriety in the novel. While Jack introduces Angie to a crowd that is inconsistent with the one she was raised in, she is still able to maintain her sense of propriety. She never turns into a Jane Rady. In contrast Lorraine does not keep her sense of propriety and because of this is embarrassed to be with her own family. First on the Fourth of July, then when she sees Angie and Jack out on a date, and finally when she leaves for school early.
Literary significance and criticism.
Some critics claim that "the modern period of young adult literature is often said to have begun with Seventeenth Summer". Daly is a teen writing for teens and her work influenced other writers to write specifically with the young adult audience in mind. Dwight Burton claims that, because Daly was so near adolescence herself, ""Seventeenth Summer" captures better any other novel, the spirit of adolescents."
The adolescent work was controversial for its time; though it deals with a chaste relationship between Jack and Angie, it addresses the topic of sexuality and desire in a way that had not yet been addressed in a work of adolescent fiction. Also it shows underage drinking and smoking.

Jotapianus

Marcus F. Ru. Jotapianus (d. "c." 249) or Jotapian, he was also known as Iotapianus or Iotapian. Jotapianus was an usurper in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire during the reign of Emperor Philip the Arab, around 249. Jotapianus is known from his rare coins and from accounts in Aurelius Victor ("Caesares" xxix.2), Zosimus (i.20.2 and i.21.2), and Polemius Silvius ("Laterculus").
Life.
Origins.
Jotapianus was a member of the Near East indigenous aristocracy. His name is similar to those of Queen Julia Iotapa and her daughter, princess Julia Jotapa of the Kingdom of Commagene, so he could have been a member of the Royal Family of Commagene, which had lost its power in favour of the Romans under Emperor Vespasian in 72.
Aurelius Victor reports that Jotapianus claimed descendance from an Alexander. According to some scholars, he referred to Alexander Severus, while other scholars note that King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene claimed descendance from Greek King Alexander the Great. He could be a possible descendant of Gaius Julius Agrippa or his brother Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus or his sister Julia Iotapa.
Revolt and Death.
Jotapianus led a rebellion started in Syria, towards the end of Philip's rule, against the increase in taxation ordered by the "rector Orientis" Priscus, Philip's brother. It is possible that Philip somehow favoured his Arabia over the other Eastern provinces, since his rule was not quietly accepted by the local population. Jotapianus made Antioch his capital, but the rebellion came to an end and Jotapianus was killed by his own soldiers, possibly during Emperor Decius' rule.
Coinage.
Coins issued by Jotapianus had been found. All of them are antoniniani, all of them show a crude design, and all of them have a VICTORIA AVG reverse, celebrating a victory of the rebels over Philip troops or rather "the power of the Emperor to conquer" ("Roman Imperial Coins", 4.3). It has been suggested that Jotapianus also issued Aureus, none of which survived.
The coins are the only source for his names, M. F. RV., which could be expanded as Marcus Fulvius Rufus. Furthermore, their style suggest that the revolt was short and spread over a small territory, since Jotapianus controlled no major mint.

Tanilba Bay, New South Wales

Tanilba Bay is a suburb of the Port Stephens local government area in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. It is located on the Tilligerry Peninsula adjacent to the bay from which it got its name. "Tanilba" is said to mean "place of white flowers" in a local Indigenous language, presumably a reference to the flannel flowers which formerly thrived in the area. At the 2011 census Tanilba Bay had a population of 2,921.
Tanilba House.
The centrepiece of this small town is Tanilba House which is one of Australia's oldest buildings. In 1831 Lieut William Caswell, Royal Navy, received a land grant of , along with an assignment of convicts who cleared the land and built Tanilba House from locally quarried stone. Ten acres (4 hectares) on the eastern side of the hill was used as a vineyard soon after the house was built. An olive tree planted in the vineyard survives to this day.
In 1931 Tanilba House was owned by Henry Halloran who designed such structures as "The Temple", which is behind Tanilba House on the road leading to the house, and the elaborate gates at what were then the north and south entrances to the town. Today the town has expanded and the still incomplete gates stand inside the town limits. Tanilba House is surrounded by houses.
It was proposed that the Prime Minister of Australia would live here until Canberra was settled.
Beaches.
Part of the town is on the banks of Tanilba Bay. The beaches consist mainly of sand flats that are exposed at low tide and are completely covered at high tide. The water is protected from southerly winds which make it a popular place for skiing. The town is fairly popular with tourists.

Strike plate

A strike plate is a metal plate affixed to a door jamb with a hole or holes for the bolt of the door. When the door is closed, the bolt extends into the hole in the strike plate and holds the door closed. The strike plate protects the jamb against friction from the bolt and increases security in the case of a jamb made of a softer material (such as wood) than the strike plate. 
Some strike plates have their hole size and placement calculated so a spring-bolt extends into the hole, but an adjacent anti-retraction device remains depressed, preventing the bolt from being retracted unless the lock is turned.

Philippine legislative election, 1943

National Assembly elections were held in the Philippines on September 20, 1943 for the elected and appointed representative to the newly created National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic which replaced the National Assembly of the Philippines of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. The Commonwealth government was exiled in Washington, D.C. upon the invitation of Pres. Roosevelt. The Japanese took over Manila on January 2, 1942 and soon established the Japanese Military Administration to replace the exiled Commonwealth government. It utilized the existing administrative structure already in place and coerced high-ranking Commonwealth officials left behind to form a government. In order to win greater support for Japan and its war effort, no less than Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō promised the Filipinos independence earlier than the Tydings-McDuffie Act had scheduled. But before it could be realized a constitution would have to be adopted. The Preparatory Commission for Philippine Independence drafted what came to be known as the 1943 Constitution. It provided for a unicameral National Assembly that was to be composed of provincial governors and city mayors as ex officio members and another representative elected from each province and city who were to serve for a term of three years. Though created subordinate to the executive, the National Assembly had the power to elect the President, who in turn appoints the provincial governors and city mayors, ensuring him control of the legislature.

At the conclusion of the final competition, Kimberly Pressler of New York, was crowned by outgoing titleholder Shawnae Jebbia of Massachusetts. Pressler became the third Miss New York USA to win the crown on finals night, and the fourth titleholder from New York.
After months of negotiation, Branson was announced as the pageant's location in November 1998. City officials spent $125,000 of tax money to host the pageant in Branson in the hope that it would encourage tourism but admitted after the pageant that it was not worth the cost. Sponsors contributed a further $1 million towards the hosting of the event. The pageant had previously been held in Shreveport, Louisiana from 1997-1998.
Shemar Moore hosted the pageant for the only time, and color commentary was added by Miss USA 1996 Ali Landry and Julie Moran, for the second consecutive year. Entertainment was provided by Collin Raye and The Atomic Fireballs.
Delegates.
The Miss USA 1999 delegates were:
Crossovers.
Thirteen delegates had previously competed or would later compete in either the Miss World, Miss Teen USA or Miss America pageants.

John Entenza

John Entenza (December 4, 1905 – April 27, 1984) was one of the pivotal figures in the growth of American modernism: in the fields of environmental, architectural, landscape, and product design; and fine arts, and artisan crafts; in post-war California and the United States.
Career.
In 1938, John Entenza joined California Arts and Architecture magazine as editor. By 1943, he had completely overhauled the magazine and renamed it "Arts & Architecture Magazine". During his editorship, "Arts & Architecture Magazine" championed all that was new in the arts, with special emphasis on emerging modernist architecture in Southern California. He made it the first American magazine to popularize the work of Hans Hofmann, Craig Ellwood, Margaret DePatta, George Nakashima, Bernard Rosenthal, Charles Eames, Konrad Wachsmann, and many others. Entenza served as director of the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts in Chicago from 1960 until his retirement in 1971. He received a Distinguished Service citation from the American Institute of Architects. He also served as a trustee of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art.
Entenza died of cancer in La Jolla, California at the age of 78.
Case Study homes.
Entenza's most lasting contribution was his sponsorship of the Case Study Houses project, which featured the works of architects such as Raphael Soriano, Charles Eames, Craig Ellwood, Pierre Koenig, Richard Neutra, Eero Saarinen, Rodney Walker and William Wurster. "Arts & Architecture" also ran articles and interviews on artists and designers such as Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, George Nakashima, George Nelson, and many other ground-breakers.

Itcha Mountain

Itcha Mountain is one of the two main volcanic peaks of the Itcha Range, which is located in the Chilcotin District of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada. It is in the Anahim Volcanic Belt, which formed when the North American Plate moved over a hotspot, similar to the one feeding the Hawaiian Islands. The Anahim Volcanic Belt includes other immediately nearby ranges, the Rainbow and Ilgachuz Ranges. Itcha Mountain is located northeast of Anahim Lake and northeast of Mount Downton, another peak of the Itcha Range. Both of these peaks are located within Itcha Ilgachuz Provincial Park, as is Far Mountain, the park's highest peak.
This mountain is the namesake for the Itcha Range, which is one of the several large shield volcanoes that stands all by itself.

Juancho De la Espriella

Juan Mario de la Espriella Salcedo better known as Juancho de la Espriella Salcedo (Born February 26, 1973 in Sincelejo, Sucre) is a Colombian musician interpreter of vallenato in accordion. De la Espriella is the current accordionist of Colombian vallenato singer Martin Elias Diaz.
References.
"Juancho", as they call him baby, born on February 26, 1973 in Sincelejo, Sucre, a son of Rosario Salcedo and Carlos De La Espriella (RIP), who inherited much of his love of vallenato music.
Since very little inclination for the accordion was evident: after 3 years changed the toy cars and superheroes by an instrument of these. However, his love for the accordion began formally at age 13, when he began practicing long hours locked in his room, dreaming one day be recognized as one of the best.
Time passed and Juan Mario was emerging as a faithful follower of the school of Arturo Gonzalo "El Cocha" Molina, and this was evident when he played Juancho partying and serenades: the influence of the great accordion was visible in the notes of the accordion.
In the early 90's and after waiting for a long time an opportunity to showcase their talent, Juancho Miguel Cabrera met, with whom he made his first musical called "little piece of my life 1994," the singer made one more album "lo mejor que tengo" 1996, where Juancho failed to show the potential he had in his veins.
After acquiring some musical maturity, in the late 90s, Juan Mario teamed with Peter Manjarrés. (1998) "Una nueva generacion"- (2000) Inolvidable-(2001) "un nuevo sentimiento" (2002) LLego El Momento. With musical productions he made four of which came off hits like "Your black love you", "Better not want much," "The Street", "Walk in harmony" and "It's time", among many others . 
In 2002 Juancho started a new period in his musical life with Dangond Silvestre, with whom he recorded six albums that earned him countless victories, with whom he worked until January 2012. (2002)"Llego el momento" -(2003)"Lo mejor para los dos" -(2004) Mas Unidos que nunca" -(2005) "Ponte a la Moda"-(2006)"La Fama"-(2008) "El Original"-(2010)"Cantinero"-(2012) "No me Compares Con Nadie".
That same month he joined with Martin Elias Diaz, a young man of Valledupar, heir to one of the most talented musical dynasties of all time and who has done an excellent musical partner, worthy of great prizes and recognition from the public and media. With Martin recorded "The boom of the moment," a musical production with a lot of maturity, which is perceived a youthful and modern, mixed with the professionalism that characterizes them.
However, Juancho's career does not stop here, there is a very important event that marked much of his musical maturity: the recording in 2003 of "Asking Road" with Diomedes Diaz the "Chief of the Board", father of the current musical companion, Elias Diaz Marin, this album was a success and further revealed the talent of this young artist, by then, already received the best reviews of review vallenato.
Even in 2006, recorded at Fiesta Juancho Beto Vallenata with Zabaleta and Jorge Celedon.
To Juancho all the good things that have happened in your life are due to God and his greatness. So every day give thanks for the good time is going on, but asks God if it comes to an end, her love never fades vallenato music, because it is part of its essence as a musician and as a person.

<doc id="9785931" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9785931" title="Female condom">
Female condom

A female condom (also known as a femidom) is a device that is used during sexual intercourse as a barrier contraceptive and to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs—such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV) and unintended pregnancy. Invented by Danish MD Lasse Hessel, it is worn internally by the female partner and provides a physical barrier to prevent exposure to ejaculated semen or other body fluids. Female condoms can be used by the receptive partner during anal sex.
The female condom is a thin, soft, loose-fitting sheath with a flexible ring at each end. They typically come in various sizes. For most vaginas, a moderately sized condom is adequate; women who have recently given birth should try a large first. The inner ring at the closed end of the sheath is used to insert the condom inside the vagina and to hold it in place during intercourse. The rolled outer ring at the open end of the sheath remains outside the vagina and covers part of the external genitalia.
Versions and materials.
The FC1 female condom was first made from polyurethane. The second generation female condom is called the FC2 and is made from synthetic nitrile. (this material change was announced in September 2005, and full transition of the product line to FC2 was done by October 2009 ). The newer nitrile condoms are less likely to make potentially distracting crinkling noises. FC2 was developed to take the place of FC1, providing the same safety and efficacy during use, but at a lower cost. It is hoped the nitrile condoms will also allow for significant reductions in female condom pricing. FC2 is manufactured by The Female Health Company. The World Health Organization (WHO) has cleared FC2 for purchase by U.N. agencies and the UNFPA (a U.N. agency) has incorporated the female condom into national programming. They are sold under many brand names, including "Reality, Femidom, Dominique, Femy, Myfemy, Protectiv" and "Care".
A recent version of the female condom is made from natural latex, the same material used in male condoms. This condom does not make the noises some experience with plastic condoms. This type of female condom is manufactured by Medtech Products Ltd, India. It is sold under various brand names, including "Reddy", "V Amour", "L'amour", "VA WOW Feminine condom", and "Sutra". One more clinical trial is required before it can be considered for FDA approval in the United States.
The global health nonprofit Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) has also developed a female condom tailored for use in developing countries. The Woman's Condom is manufactured by Shanghai Dahua Medical Apparatus in China and is in early introduction.
Products and manufacturers.
FC2
The FC2 female condom is a nitrile sheath or pouch in length. At each end there is a flexible ring. At the closed end of the sheath, the flexible ring is inserted into the vagina to hold the female condom in place. The other end of the sheath stays outside the vulva at the entrance to the vagina. This ring acts as a guide during penetration and stops the sheath from shifting during intercourse. There is a silicone-based lubricant on the inside of the condom, but additional lubrication can be used. The condom does not contain spermicide.
The original version of the FC female condom (brand names included Reality, Femy and Femidom), was made of polyurethane. As this was a relatively expensive material, the makers of the FC female condom released the FC2 version made of the cheaper nitrile material. Large-scale production of the FC2 began in 2007. The condom was approved by the FDA in March 2009. Production of the original FC condom has now stopped.
VA W.o.W.
The VA w.o.w.® Feminine Condom (Reddy Female Condom) is manufactured by Medtech Products Ltd. This latex condom has a pouch attached to its rounded triangular opening and a sponge to secure it inside a woman’s vagina. It is available through the private sector in several countries, including South Africa, Brazil, and India. The VA w.o.w.® Feminine Condom recently received the CE mark, a certification that it meets European Union consumer health requirements. It is also under review by the WHO.
The Woman's Condom
The Woman’s Condom, developed by PATH, through a user-centered design process, is a new female contraceptive designed for improved acceptability, ease of use, and good sensation. The Woman’s Condom is a polyurethane pouch that is partially enclosed in a capsule to aid insertion. The capsule dissolves quickly after insertion in the vagina, which releases the pouch. The condom is then held stable in the woman by foam pads. The Woman's Condom is packaged dry and comes with a small sachet of water-based lubricant to be applied at point of use. PATH licensed manufacturing and distribution of the Woman's Condom to the Shanghai Dahua Medical Apparatus Company in 2008. Dahua has received the South Africa Bureau of Standards (SABS) certification marking (2013), Shanghai Food and Drug Administration Approval (2011), and the CE Mark approval (2010) for the Woman's Condom, which allows for marketing and distribution of the product in South Africa, China, and Europe, respectively. The Woman's Condom is currently under review by the WHO/United Nations Population Fund Technical Review Committee; the Committee's approval could lead to bulk public-sector purchase by United Nations agencies.
Natural Sensation Female Condom
The Natural Sensation Panty Condom is distributed in the US exclusively by the ACME Condom Company. It is manufactured by Natural Sensation Compañia Ltda. (NS) based in Bogotá, Colombia. The product is made of a polyethylene resin, which is stronger and thinner than latex. Unlike latex, polyethylene is anti-allergenic, ultra sensitive, transparent and odorless. Natural Sensation’s condoms are lubricated and may be used with either oil- or water-based lubricants.
Silk Parasol Female Condom
The Female Panty Condom is manufactured by Silk Parasol. It is made of biodegradable latex. It has not yet been approved by the FDA and is currently undergoing clinical trials.
The Phoenurse Female Condom
The Phoenurse™ is made of a dumbbell-shaped polyurethane sheath and comes with an insertion tool, a water- or silicone-based lubricant, sanitary towels, and disposal bags. It is manufactured by the Tianjin Condombao Medical Polyurethane Tech. Co. Ltd. and is approved for sale in the European Economic Area. The Phoenurse female condom is also available in Brazil, Sri Lanka, China, Kenya, and Mexico. It has not been approved by the FDA.
Cupid's Female Condom
The Cupid’s Female Condom is made of natural latex rubber and manufactured in India by Cupid Ltd. It is approved for distribution in Europe and was prequalified for distribution by WHO in 2012. It is currently undergoing clinical trials to gain approval by the FDA.
Origami Female Condom
The ORIGAMI Female Condom™ (OFC) is fabricated in molded silicone for anatomical conformity. It was validated as 100% biocompatible and non-allergenic in independent pre-clinical lab testing. The condom is not yet approved for sale and must be reviewed by the WHO, the C-Mark (EU), And the FDA to meet regulatory safety requirements. The OFC is in clinical trials in San Francisco, CA in collaboration with the Women’s Global Health Imperative at RTI, International. Large-scale clinical trials will follow in 2014, to evaluate its performance and safety. It is expected to reach the market in late 2015, pending regulatory pre-market approvals.
Proper usage.
To insert an FC2: 
During vaginal intercourse, it is normal for the female condom to move side to side. Stop intercourse if the penis slips between the condom and the walls of the vagina or if the outer ring is pushed into the vagina. As long as the partner has not yet ejaculated, the condom can be gently removed from the vagina to add extra spermicide or lubricant and inserted once again.
Some consumers use the FC2 for anal intercourse, although it is not tested or FDA approved for this off-label use. Nonetheless, some consumer have followed the vaginal use instructions to insert FC2 into the anus however it is not recommend to remove and reinsert.
To remove an FC2: 
Reusing a FC2 is not recommended.
Costs and "reuse" of the original FC and FC2.
The per unit price of female condoms is higher than male condoms but there is some evidence to suggest that polyurethane female condoms can be washed, disinfected, and reused.
Re-using the polyurethane female condom is not considered as safe as using a new one, however the WHO says, "Batches of new, unused female condoms were subjected to seven cycles of disinfection, washing, drying and re-lubrication, reflecting the steps and procedures in the draft protocol, but at considerably higher concentrations of bleach and for longer durations. All female condom batches met the manufacturing quality assessment specifications for structural integrity after the test cycles. ... Disinfection, washing, drying, re-lubrication and reuse of the device were not associated with penile discharge, symptomatic vaginal irritation or adverse colposcopic findings in study volunteers." A presentation at the 1998 International AIDS conference concluded that "washing, drying and re-lubricating the female condom up to ten times does not significantly alter the structural integrity of the device. Further microbiological and virological tests are required before re-use of the female condom can be recommended."
Research suggests that the FC2 female condoms are a cost-effective method of HIV prevention even at low levels of use. The data shows that the cost-effectiveness would increase significantly at higher levels of use. A study conducted in 2005 by Dr. David Holtgrave, Chair of the Department of Health, Behavior and Society at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, examined the projected public health impact that the FC2 female condom would have at different levels of use in two developing countries: South Africa and Brazil. The study concluded that FC2 use would generate significant cost savings at all levels of implementation by preventing thousands of HIV infections and saving millions of dollars in health care costs. There is some evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of female condoms in preventing transmission of HIV may be similar to that of male condoms.
Lubrication.
As with all barrier contraceptives, water or silicone-based lubricants are safe to use with any female condom. Oil should not be used with a female condom made of latex.
FC2 Female Condom comes pre-lubricated with a non-spermicidal, silicone based lubricant. The FC2 is made of nitrile so oil-based (or water-based) lubricants can be added on the inside and outside of FC2 Female Condom or on the penis.
Effectiveness.
When used correctly, the female condom has a 5% failure rate. Inconsistent or incorrect usage has been shown to result in a 21% failure rate.
Benefits
Some benefits of female condoms over other methods of birth control are that they: 
Drawbacks
Some women and men may not like the female condom because it may:
Advantages.
FC2 Female Condom gives women control and choice over their own sexual health; women can protect themselves when their partner does not want to use a male condom; female condoms may provide enhanced sensation for men as compared to male condoms; FC2 is hypo allergenic and is safe to use with people who are allergic to rubber latex; FC2 may be inserted hours before intercourse; female condoms are not dependent on the penis being erect for insertion and does not require immediate withdrawal after ejaculation; FC2 is not tight or constricting; FC2 is highly lubricated and the material warms to body temperature.
The external genitals of the wearer and the base of the penis of the inserting partner may be more protected (from skin-to-skin transmitted STDs such as herpes and HPV) than when the male condom is used, however see studies below.
Worldwide use.
Sales of female condoms have been disappointing in developed countries, though developing countries are increasingly using them to complement already existing family planning and HIV/AIDS programming. Probable causes for poor sales are that inserting the female condom is a skill that has to be learned and that female condoms can be significantly more expensive than male condoms (upwards of 2 or 3 times the cost). Also, reported "rustling" sounds from the original version of the female condom during intercourse turn off some potential users, as does the visibility of the outer ring which remains outside the vagina.
In November 2005, the World YWCA called on national health ministries and international donors to commit to purchasing 180 million female condoms for global distribution in 2006, stating that "Female condoms remain the only tool for HIV prevention that women can initiate and control," but that they remain virtually inaccessible to women in the developing world due to their high cost of 72¢ per piece. If 180 million female condoms were ordered, the price of a single female condom was projected to decline to 22¢.
In 2005, 12 million female condoms were distributed to women in the developing world. By comparison, between 6 and 9 billion male condoms were distributed that year.
Awareness and access.
Recently, a number of initiatives have been undertaken by international and intergovernmental organizations to expand access to the female condom. In 2012, the United Nations (UN) Commission on Life-Saving Commodities for Women and Children endorsed female condoms as one of its 13 Life-Saving Commodities, catalyzing inter-organizational efforts to overcome several commodity-specific barriers currently inhibiting women in the developing world from benefiting from this product.
Price has been one of the key obstacles in expanding access to female condoms on an international level. Female condoms cost, on average, US $2–4, depending on local market factors. At the 2012 Family Planning Summit in London, the Female Health Company pledged to increase access to the FC2® female condom for the world’s poorest countries and announced a prospective pricing arrangement based on aggregate purchases and 5 percent free goods based on the prior year’s purchases, together with a multiyear agreement to provide $14 million in 
training and education by FHC over the next six years.
The Cupid™ female condoms have been sold in Kyrgyz Republic through UNFPA for their public distribution system. The Woman’s Condom has been sold to the public sector in China. Globally, it is acknowledged that further price reductions are necessary to achieve universal access to female condoms. Based on market analysis it is expected that sustainable price reductions are feasible.
Campaigns.
Prevention Now!
The Center for Health and Gender Equity’s Prevention Now! Campaign promotes the use of male and female condoms as a means of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS; reducing instances of unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, and other unsafe outcomes of unprotected sexual intercourse; promote the sexual and reproductive health and rights of all persons; and expand choices for those living with HIV/AIDS.
Put a Ring on It! - Chicago Female Condom Campaign
The Chicago Female Condom Campaign is a coalition of HIV/AIDS, reproductive justice, women’s health, and gay men’s health organizations dedicated to increasing access, affordability, availability, awareness, and utilization of female condoms. Lead partners include the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, Chicago Women’s AIDS Project, Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Health, Pediatric AIDS Chicago Prevention Initiative, Mujeres Latinas en Accion, and Planned Parenthood of Illinois.

In 1990 he ran as a M-19 political candidate during the Colombian presidential elections finishing third and receiving 12.48% of the votes; he ran again unsuccessfully in the 1994 presidential election, and attempted to run for the 2006 presidential elections but lost the candidacy of his party during the primaries. In 1991 he was elected to the National Constituent Assembly, of which became Co-President along with Álvaro Gómez Hurtado and Horacio Serpa Uribe; it was this Assembly that drafted the Colombian Constitution of 1991 which remains the supreme law of the country. He has also served in Congress, being elected to serve both in the Chamber from 1998 to 2002, and the Senate from 2002 to 2006; and elected Mayor of Pasto serving from 1995 to 1998, and Governor of Nariño from 2008 to 2012.
Before M-19.
Antonio José was born on 9 July 1948 in Pasto to Rafael Navarro Uribe and María Emma Wolff Pizarro. In 1972, Navarro graduated as a sanitary engineer from the University of Valle, after which he took postgraduate courses and eventually became a professor at the same university. He studied Environmental Engineering at Loughborough University, UK in 1976 on a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation, the British Council and the International Development Research Center (IDRC) of Canada.
As a sanitary engineer, he was an adviser of the Social Medicine Department of the University of Valle (1972), coordinator of the Multidisciplinary Research Centre for Rural Development (CIMDER, 1972–1977), international adviser of the IDRC (1976–1978), Professor at the University of Valle (1972–1978), director of the Curriculum of Sanitary Engineering at the university, and a private consultant.
Militancy in M-19.
At the end of the 1970s, he became a part of the guerilla group M-19. Within the M-19, Navarro ascended to second-in-command of the organization. One of the most controversial episodes of M-19 was the take-over of the Palace of Justice by armed guerrillas. They pretended to demand a trial of President Belisario Betancur for violation of the peace accords. During the operation led by security forces to retake the Palace, a large group of guerrillas, civilians, magistrates and soldiers lost their lives— at least 53 civilian casualties were registered, including several members of Colombia's Supreme Court of Justice. The siege has been catalogued as a holocaust and massacre by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Although the exact events that occurred will probably never be clear, some unconfirmed versions suggest the guerrillas were financed by the narcotics trafficker Pablo Escobar, in return for the destruction of compromising documents. 
Peace Negotiations.
Navarro coordinated peace negotiations for this movement the government of President Betancur in 1984 and 1985. He was named head of the Commission to organize the National Dialogue, along with Vera Grabe, Alfonso Jacquin, Andrés Almarales and Israel Santamaría. Talks were broken off, truces failed and the peace process died. In May 1985, the talks collapsed after an attack in a cafeteria in the city of Cali, when an army man threw a grenade that exploded ten centimeters away from Navarro, who was severely wounded. The facial nerve that controls the left part the jaw was destroyed and he lost his left leg below the knee. M-19 was told that Navarro was to be attacked in the hospital, so he was evacuated to Mexico where the leg was amputated. He received a prosthesis in Cuba.
Later, Carlos Pizarro carried out peace negotiations with the government of President Virgilio Barco. The peace signed 11 March 1990.
After signing the peace accords, M-19 nominated its leader, Carlos Pizarro Leongómez for the presidency of the republic, but he was assassinated on a commercial flight from Bogotá to Barranquilla on 26 April 1990. After the Pizarro's burial, the leaders of M-19 met and decided to continue with the peace process of peace. They nominated Navarro for the Presidency, who came in third in the balloting.
Political life.
In the 2000s, M-19 entered a leftist coalition of parties called the Alternative Democratic Pole and Navarro became its Secretary General. 
Antonio Navarro has been mayor of the city of Pasto, Congressman of Colombia and was one of the three collegiate presidents of the Constituent Assembly of Colombia writing the Colombian Constitution of 1991. He has served as Colombian Minister of Health.
In 2006, he ran for the presidency of Colombia, but lost to Carlos Gaviria in the party primaries. He then ran for the Senate and was elected. After he is elected governor of Nariño of the PDA. Later after the election of Gustavo Petro as mayor of Bogotá, Navarro was appointed Secretary of Government which takes turn as spokesman for the mayor. However resignation for personal reasons in late March 2012 in charge subsequently assuming the Progressive Movement spokesperson.
Popular Culture.
Navarro is portrayed by the actor Fabio Rubiano as the character of 'Marcos' in TV series Escobar, el patrón del mal.

Krishnaism

Krishnaism (also Bhagavatism) is a group of Hindu denominations within Vaishnavism, centered on devotion to Krishna or other forms of Krishna. It is often also called Bhagavatism, because it is the Bhagavata Purana that asserts that Krishna is "Bhagavan Himself," and subordinates to itself all other forms: Vishnu, Narayana, Purusha, Ishvara, Hari, Vasudeva, Janardana, etc. The term "Krishnaism" has been used to describe the sects focused on Krishna, while "Vaishnavism" for sects focusing on Vishnu in which Krishna is an Avatar, rather than a transcended Supreme Being.
Krishnaism originates in the early centuries CE, arising from an amalgamation of the heroic Krishna Vasudeva, the "divine child" Bala Krishna and the Gopala traditions, and syncretism of these non-Vedic traditions with the Mahabharata canon, thus affiliating itself with Vedism in order to become acceptable to the orthodox establishment.
Krishnaism becomes associated with bhakti yoga in the medieval period. Friedhelm Hardy in his "Viraha-bhakti" analyses the history of Krishnaism, specifically all pre-11th-century sources starting with the stories of Krishna and the gopi, and Mayon mysticism of the Vaishnava Tamil saints, Sangam Tamil literature and Alvars' Krishna-centered devotion in the rasa of the emotional union and the dating and history of the Bhagavata Purana. The central text of Krishnaism is the Bhagavad Gita.
Krishnaism has a limited following outside of India, especially associated with 1960s counter-culture, including a number of celebrity followers, such as George Harrison, due to its promulgation throughout the world by the founder-acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.
Definition.
Vaishnavism is a monotheism, sometimes described as "polymorphic monotheism", with the implication that there are many forms of one original deity, that is, belief in a single unitary deity who takes many forms. In Krishnaism this deity is Krishna, sometimes referred as intimate deity - as compared with the numerous four-armed forms of Narayana or Vishnu. While in common language the term is not often used, as many prefer a wider term "Vaishnavism", which appeared to relate to Vishnu (more specifically as Vishnu-ism), there are a few theories as to the origins and the definitions of Krishnaism.
Within Vaishnavism, Krishnaism contrasts with "Vishnuism". Vishnuism believes in Vishnu as the supreme being, manifested himself as Krishna, while Krishnaism accepts Krishna to be Svayam bhagavan or "authentic", that manifested himself as Vishnu. As such Krishnaism is believed to be one of the early attempts to make philosophical Hinduism appealing to the masses.
Historically, it was Caitanya Mahaprabhu who founded congregational chanting of holy names of Krishna in the early 16th century after becoming a sannyasi.
The object.
Krishna is the principal deity of Krishnaism that is also worshiped across many other traditions of Hinduism. Krishna is often described as having the appearance of a dark-skinned person and is depicted as a young cowherd boy playing a flute or as a youthful prince giving philosophical direction and guidance, as in the Bhagavad Gita.
Krishna and the stories associated with him appear across a broad spectrum of different Hindu philosophical and theological traditions, where its believed that God appears to his devoted worshippers in many different forms, depending on their particular desires. These forms include the different "avataras" of Krishna described in traditional Vaishnava texts, but they are not limited to these. Indeed, it is said that the different expansions of the Svayam bhagavan are uncountable and they cannot be fully described in the finite scriptures of any one religious community. Many of the Hindu scriptures sometimes differ in details reflecting the concerns of a particular tradition, while some core features of the view on Krishna are shared by all.
Main traditions.
Origins.
Gopala Krsna of Krishnaism is often contrasted with Vedism especially based on the story appearing in the Bhagavata Purana when Krishna asks his followers to desist from Vedic Indra worship. Thus the character of Gopala Krishna is often considered to be non-Vedic.
Worship of Krishna, the deified tribal hero and religious leader of the Yadavas, took sectarian form as the Pancaratra and earlier as Bhagavata religions. This sect has at a later stage merged with the sect of Narayana.
Early Krishnaism thus consist of an amalgamation of the heroic Krishna Vasudeva, the "divine child" Bala Krishna and the Gopala traditions.
By its incorporation into the Mahabharata canon during the early centuries CE, Krishnaism began to affiliate itself with Vedism in order to become acceptable to orthodoxy, in particular aligning itself with Rigvedic Vishnu. By the Early Medieval period, Krishnaism had risen to a major current of Vaishnavism.
According to Hardy's study of the various connections between records and traditions there is evidence of early "southern Krishnaism", even there is a tendency to allocate this tradition to the Northern traditions. There is a narrative context in which the early writings in Dravidian culture such as "Manimekalai" and the "Cilappatikaram" present Krishna, his brother, and favorite female companions in the similar terms. Friedhelm Hardy argues that the Sanskrit Bhagavata Purana is essentially a Sanskrit "translation" of the bhakti of the Tamil alvars.
Whether to accept this radical suggestion, it an accepted view that South Indian texts illustrate close parallels to the Sanskrit traditions of Krishna and his gopi companions, so ubiquitous in later North Indian text and imagery.
While some refer to devotion to indigenous Mal (Tirumal) as early forms of Krishnaism, since Mal appears as a divine figure, largely like Krishna with some elements of Vishnu.
It has been suggested by Hardy that the term "Mayonism" should be used instead of "Krishnaism" when referring to Mal or Mayon. On the other hand another prominent early evidence gathered from the poetry of Alvars, whose name can be translated "sages" or "saints", is that they were devotees of Mal. In their poems there comes a pronounced orientation to the Vaishnava and often Krishna side of Mal. It is however important to note that they do not make the distinction between Krishna and Vishnu on the basis of the concept of the Avatars.
Early and medieval traditions.
Vaishnavism in the 8th century came into contact with the Advaita doctrine of Adi Shankara.
There were counter-movements in South India to Shankara's theory of Brahman in particular, Ramanuja in the 11th century and Madhva in the 13th, building on the devotional tradition of the Alvars (Shri Vaishnavas).
The Bhakti movement of late medieval Hinduism emerges in the 9th or 10th century, and is based on the Bhagavata Purana. On opinion of others it is Bhagavad Gita that may be said to constitute the gospel of Krishnaism. It is believed to be the most seminal of all Hindu scriptures.
In North India, Krishnaism gave rise to various late Medieval movements: Nimbarka and Ramananda in the 14th century, Kabir and Sankaradeva in the 15th and Vallabha and Caitanya in the 16th.
South Indian traditions and evidence
Radha Krishna traditions (Krishna as the Supreme, not as an avatar)
Krishna worship alone without Radha
Krishna worship as an avatar
Mixed modes traditions
Krishna worship as Ishta-deva
Radha Krishna.
A number of interpretations according to traditions possess a common root of personalism in the understanding of worship. Some proclaiming the supremacy of Krishna and the reality and eternality of individual selves.
One of the kings of Manipur, Gareeb Nivaz, ruling from 1709 to 1748, was initiated into Krishnaism and practiced this religion for nearly twenty years. Since that period of time Manipuri Vaishnavas do not worship Krishna alone, but Radha-Krishna. With the spread of the worship of Krishna and Radha, it becomes the dominant form in the Manipur region.
Charlotte Vaudeville, in her essay ‘"Evolution of Love Symbolism in Bhagavatism"’, draws some parallel to Nappinnai, appearing in Godha's magnum opus Thiruppavai and also in Nammalwar's references to Nappinnani, the daughter-in-law of Nandagopa. Nappinnai is believed to be the source of Radha's conception in Prakrit and Sanskrit literature, although their characteristic relations with Krishna are different.
Yasastilaka Champukavya (AD 959) makes references to Radha and Krishna well before Jayadeva's period. There are elaborate references to Radha in Brahma vaivarta and Padma Puranas.
Early Bengali literature gives a vivid description of the depiction and evolution of understanding of Radha and Krishna. However the source of Jayadeva Goswamis heroine in his poem Gita Govinda remains a puzzle in Sanskrit Literature.
In Caitanya Vaishnavism metaphysical status and Radha-worship is considered to be established by Krsnadasa in his Caitanya Caritamrta where he represents the doctrine that prevailed among the Vrindavan Caitanyaites following Caitanya's demise in 1533. 
One of the self-manifested deities established by Gopala Bhatta Goswami is called Radharamana; it is not surprising that Radharamana is seen as not only Krishna but also as Radha-Krishna.
The adepts and followers of the Nimbarka Sampradaya worship the youthful Krishna, alone or with his consort Radha are representing the earliest of the second wave of Greater Krishnaism, dating at least to the 12th century, matching and extending beyond tradition of the Rudra Sampradaya does.
According to Nimbarka, Radha was the eternal consort of Vishnu-Krishna and there is also a suggestion, though not a clear statement, that she became the wife of her beloved Krishna.
Vallabhacharya introduced the worship of Radha Krishna, where according to some sects, for example, the devotees identify mainly with the female companion ("sakhi") of Radha who is privileged to witness the Radha-Krsna private relationship.
In the Swaminarayan Faith, spreading very rapidly throughout the world, Radha Krishna Dev has a special place as Swaminarayan himself made a reference to Radha Krishna in the Shikshapatri.
Holy places.
Vrindavana is often considered to be a holy place by majority of traditions of Krishnaism. It's a center of Krishna worship and the area includes places like Govardhana and Gokula associated with Krishna from time immemorial. Many millions of "bhaktas" or devotees of Krishna visit these places of pilgrimage every year and participate in a number of festivals that relate to the scenes from Krishna's life on Earth.
On the other hand, Goloka is considered the eternal abode of Krishna, Svayam bhagavan according to some Vaishnava schools, including Gaudiya Vaishnavism and the Swaminarayan Sampraday. The scriptural basis for this is taken in Brahma Samhita and Bhagavata Purana.
Scriptures.
Common scriptures.
While every tradition of Krishnaism has its own canon, in all Krishna is accepted as a teacher of the path in the scriptures Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata Purana.
As Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, establishing the basis of Krishnaism himself:
In Gaudiya Vaishnava, Vallabha Sampradaya, Nimbarka sampradaya and the old Bhagavat school, Krishna is believed to be fully represented in his original form in the Bhagavata Purana, that at the end of the list of "avataras" concludes with the following assertion:
Not all commentators on the Bhagavata Purana stress this verse, however a majority of Krishna-centered and contemporary commentaries highlight this verse as a significant statement. Jiva Goswami has called it "Paribhasa-sutra", the "thesis statement" upon which the entire book or even theology is based.
In another place of the Bhagavata Purana (10.83.5-43) those who are named as wives of Krishna all explain to Uraupadi how the 'Lord himself' ("Svayam Bhagavan", Bhagavata Purana 10.83.7) came to marry them. As they relate these episodes, several of the wives speak of themselves as Krishna's devotees. In the tenth canto the Bhagavata Purana describes "svayam bhagavans" Krishna's childhood pastimes as that of a much-loved child raised by cowherds in Vrindavan, near to the Yamuna River. The young Krishna enjoys numerous pleasures, such as thieving balls of butter or playing in the forest with his cowherd friends. He also endures episodes of carefree bravery protecting the town from demons. More importantly, however, he steals the hearts of the cowherd girls (Gopis). Through his magical ways, he multiplies himself to give each the attention needed to allow her to be so much in love with Krishna that she feels at one with him and only desires to serve him. This love, represented by the grief they feel when Krishna is called away on a heroic mission and their intense longing for him, is presented as models of the way of extreme devotion (bhakti) to the Supreme Lord.
Sectarian scriptures.
Varkari movement.
In the Varkari movement the following scriptures are considered sacred in addition to general body of the common writing:
Relationship to other traditions in Hinduism.
While Vishnu is attested already in the Rigveda, the development of Krishnaism appears to take place via the worship of Vasudeva in the final centuries BCE. This earliest phase was established the time of Pāṇini (4th century BCE) who, in his "Astadhyayi", explained the word "vasudevaka" as a "bhakta" (devotee) of Vasudeva. The appearance of Krishna as one of the "Avatars" of Vishnu dates to the period of the Sanskrit epics in the early centuries CE. By the 8th century CE, Vasudeva has been interpreted by Adi Shankara, using the earlier Vishnu Purana as a support, as meaning the "supreme self" or Vishnu, dwelling everywhere and in all things, although many other schools of Hindu philosophy have a different interpretation of this key concept. However the primary meaning remains enshrined in the inscription of the Heliodorus pillar 110 BCE.
There is also evidence that sect which flourished with the decline of Vedism was centred on Krishna, the deified tribal hero and religious leader of the Yadavas. It is believed that at a later stage Krishnaism started to align with Vedism so that orthodoxy would find it acceptable. It is also believed that at this stage that Vishnu of the Rig Veda was assimilated into Krishnaism and became the equivalent of the Supreme God. While there is a considerable debate as to Shivaism versus Vishnuism, and foisting of Krishnaism upon Vishnu to be passed as a Vedic deity, some consider that, "stated in this way, such scarcely can have been the case".
Such views distinguishing Vishnu from Krishna are believed to be without basis by some. For example, the Mahabharata is believed by some to predate the Bhagavata Purana and in the interpretations of Vishnu sahasranama composed by Bhishma in glorification of Krishna, where Krishna, according to some commentators, is identified as an avatar of Vishnu and worship of Krishna was seen as identical to worship of Vishnu.
In the 149th chapter of "Anushāsanaparva" in the epic Mahabharata, Bhisma states, with Krishna present, that mankind will be free from all sorrows by chanting the Vishnu "sahasranama", the thousand names of the all-pervading Supreme Being Vishnu, who is the master of all the worlds, supreme over the "devas" and who is one with Brahman. This seems to indicate that Krishna is identical with Vishnu. Indeed, Krishna himself said, "Arjuna, one may be desirous of praising by reciting the thousand names. But, on my part, I feel praised by one shloka. There is no doubt about it." 
Krishnaism and Christianity.
Debaters have often alleged a number of parallels between Krishnaism and Christianity, originating with Kersey Graves' The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors claiming 346 parallels between Krishna and Jesus, theorizing that Christianity emerged as a result of an import of pagan concepts upon Judaism. Some 19th- to early 20th-century scholars writing on Jesus Christ in comparative mythology (John M. Robertson, "Christianity and Mythology", 1910) even sought to derive both traditions from a common predecessor religion.

Chana District

Chana (, ) is a district ("Amphoe") in the southeastern part of Songkhla Province, southern Thailand.
Geography.
Neighboring districts are (from the east clockwise) Thepha, Na Thawi, Sadao, Hat Yai, Na Mom and Mueang Songkhla of Songkhla Province. To the northeast is the Gulf of Thailand.
History.
Originally, Chana together with Palian, Thepha and Songkhla was one of four "Mueang" subordinate under the "Mueang" Phatthalung. When Songkhla was split off from Phatthalung and made a direct subordinate of Bangkok, Chana was then placed under Songkhla.
The location of the town was moved several times, so when it was made a district in the "thesaphiban" administrative reforms at the beginning of the 20th century the district office was located in present-day Na Thawi. However as the location turned out to be inconvenient it was moved to Ban Na. In 1917 the district was thus renamed to Ban Na after the central "tambon", in 1924 the name was changed back to Chana by the government to avoid confusion with the district Ban Na in Surat Thani province and Ban Na in Nakhon Nayok province.
Etymology.
The name Chana is actually the Thai corruption of Chenok, its original name in Malay.
Administration.
The district is subdivided into 14 subdistricts ("tambon"), which are further subdivided into 138 villages ("muban"). Chana is a subdistrict municipality ("thesaban tambon") which covers parts of "tambon" Ban Na. There are further 14 Tambon administrative organizations (TAO).

Gloriavale Christian Community

Gloriavale Christian Community is a small Christian group based at Haupiri on the West Coast of the South Island in New Zealand.
History.
The group was founded in 1969 by Neville Cooper (Hopeful Christian), an Australian-born evangelist who was invited to preach in New Zealand. He founded what became known as the Springbank Christian Community near Christchurch in the South Island. When this community grew too big for its property, the members bought land on the West Coast and shifted there over a period from 1991 to 1995. They named their new property in the Haupiri Valley "Gloriavale" and established the Gloriavale Christian Community. This property is about 60 km inland from Greymouth.
Overview.
Known by some outsiders as the "Cooperites", the group rejects this name and members refer to themselves only as Christians. Members of the community live a fundamentalist Christian life in accordance with the teachings of the New Testament. The community attempts to uphold the example of the first Christian church in Jerusalem (Acts 2:41-47) for its principles of sharing and holding all things in common. The group teaches that the only true way to salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to the commands of God.
The community earns its income from several ventures including dairying and the manufacture of gardening products made from sphagnum moss.
Education.
The community runs Gloriavale Christian Community School, a private coeducational composite (years 1-15) school with a roll of 127. The school moved to the West Coast in 1990.

Pedro Álvarez (baseball)

Pedro Manuel Álvarez Jr. (born February 6, 1987) is a Dominican-American professional baseball third baseman with the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball.
Álvarez has been nicknamed El Toro, Spanish for "the bull", because of his strength and muscular physique.
Personal.
Álvarez was born in the Dominican Republic but grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan. He married his wife, Keli, daughter of Pat Murphy, in January 2011. Álvarez is a Christian.
High school career.
Álvarez first attended the Mott Hall School for gifted and talented students in Harlem, where he was an A student. He then attended Horace Mann School in the Bronx, where he holds numerous baseball records, most notably home runs, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and RBIs. Álvarez was named Athlete of the Year his senior season. Though he attended a private school, Álvarez's abilities attracted the attention of scouts throughout the New York City area, especially after he led his club team, the Bayside Yankees, to a national title in 2005. In recognition of his success, Louisville Slugger crowned him the Player of the Year in New York and also named him to its All-America team.
Vanderbilt career.
After graduating from high school, Álvarez was drafted in the 14th round of the 2005 major league draft by the Boston Red Sox. Though offered a substantial signing bonus, Álvarez instead chose to play college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores of the Southeastern Conference. Álvarez started slowly and had some trouble adjusting to the college game. However, after growing comfortable, he became an integral member of the Commodore lineup. Álvarez put up some of the best offensive numbers in the history of Vanderbilt, setting single-season school records in home runs (22) and second in RBIs to Warner Jones. These stats earned Álvarez National Freshman of the Year honors from several publications, including "Baseball America". Álvarez was then selected to the USA National team, leading the team in batting average. "Baseball America" ranked him as the 2nd best pro prospect on the squad. In addition, "Sports Illustrated" ranked him as the best pro prospect on the team and said that he was the "early favorite to be drafted first in 2008," due to his impressive performance over the summer and as a freshman.
Before the 2007 season began Álvarez was named to the watchlist for the SEC and national player of the year awards. He was also chosen as a 1st team pre-season All-American. During the season, Álvarez had great success, hitting .397 with 17 home runs, 65 RBI, 72 runs, an on-base percentage of .467, and a slugging percentage of .706 for the 51-11 Commodores. His strong play was one of the key reasons Vanderbilt captured its first ever SEC regular-season championship. During the SEC Tournament, Álvarez powered Vanderbilt to a come-from-behind championship despite the team dropping the tournament's first game. No other team in SEC history had ever come back to win after losing its first game, and Álvarez was named Tournament MVP.
Álvarez was invited back to Team USA after his strong performance in 2006 and would prove to be a leader on the field. He led the team in homers, RBI, batting average, hits, and slugging percentage.
Professional career.
Pittsburgh Pirates.
Álvarez was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first round (second overall) in the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft. He agreed to a $6 million minor league contract with the Pirates on August 15, minutes before the deadline but did not immediately sign it. He was placed on the restricted list after the Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance against Major League Baseball over draft picks being signed minutes after the August 15 deadline. On September 22, Álvarez agreed to renegotiated terms on a four-year major league contract at $6.4 million.
Minor Leagues.
In 2009, he attended Spring Training with the Pirates, but was assigned to the minor league's spring training on March 16, 2009. After playing several months with the Pirates High-A affiliate, Lynchburg Hillcats, Álvarez was assigned to Double-A Altoona Curve in late June. Álvarez performed extremely well between the two levels, leading the Pirates organization in home runs and RBI with 27 and 95 respectively. He also batted .288 with an .917 OPS.
2010.
Álvarez started the 2010 season with the Pirates Triple-A affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians, as the 8th-best prospect in Baseball America's 2010 rankings. In 66 games with the Indians, he hit .277 with 13 home runs, 53 RBI and 4 stolen bases.
Álvarez was called up to the MLB on June 16, 2010 and made his Major League debut against John Danks of the Chicago White Sox. He went 0-for-2 with a walk, a strikeout, and a run scored.
His first Major League hit came against the Cleveland Indians on June 19, 2010, an RBI double over the left-field wall off Indians starter David Huff. The following several weeks of his career did not go so smoothly, however. He struck out at least once in each of his first 10 games, capped off by a 4-strikeout game in a 14-4 loss to the Oakland Athletics on June 25, 2010. Pirates manager John Russell then gave him a day off. His first Major League home run came against the Philadelphia Phillies on July 3, 2010, a solo shot to left field off of Phillies starter Kyle Kendrick. Following his benching, Álvarez responded with an eight-game hitting streak from June 28-July 6 that included 2 home runs, 3 runs scored and 4 RBI.
Álvarez recorded his first career multi-homer game on July 20, 2010 against the Milwaukee Brewers. He hit a grand slam in the first inning off Brewers starter Dave Bush and then followed with a solo home run in the following inning. He finished the game 2-for-4 with two runs and five RBIs, helping the Pirates to an 11-9 win. He hit two home runs again the next night against the Brewers, going 3-for-5 with 3 RBIs as part of a 15-3 Pirate victory. The home runs came against Milwaukee starter Randy Wolf and reliever Kameron Loe. After the game, Álvarez had raised his batting average over 60 points, from .197 on July 9 to .259. "Obviously, those first few weeks, it’s a million miles an hour, and as time goes on you get used to it a little bit more and more." said Álvarez of his early struggles. "It's very fun to go out there and play some good baseball and come out winning. It makes it that much better when you have a good day that you can celebrate with your teammates."
On August 7, 2010 Pedro hit a walk-off 3 run home run against the Colorado Rockies closer Huston Street.
Álvarez was named National League Player of the Week for September 20–26 for his performances. He finished the week 10-for-24 (.417) with 2 home runs and 13 RBIs. Álvarez continued his hot streak, going 4-for-5 with 5 RBIs on September 30 against the Florida Marlins while raising his season batting average 8 points from .249 to .257. Álvarez finished the season by winning the NL Rookie of the Month Award for September, hitting .311 and leading all Major League rookies with 26 RBIs in his final 27 games.
2011.
Álvarez did not immediately continue his late 2010 performance, compiling a .208 batting average and a .587 OPS in 36 games. On May 21, 2011 Álvarez was placed on the 15-day disabled list. After being reinstated from the DL on July 9, 2011 he was optioned to the AAA Indianapolis Indians.
2012.
Álvarez decided not to spend the 2011–2012 offseason playing winter league ball. After the first nine games of the 2012 season, he struck out 13 times in his first 27 at-bats. In an interleague series against the Cleveland Indians, Álvarez hit two home runs in back-to-back games on June 16 and 17, making him only the second Pirates' player with multi-home run games in back-to-back games since 1918, with Ralph Kiner being the other player. Álvarez hit a go-ahead home run in the 19th inning against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 19, the longest game in the majors to that point in the season and tied for the longest in terms of time at 6 hours, 7 minutes. Álvarez hit a 469-ft home run, the longest hit by a Pittsburgh Pirate in the history of PNC Park to date, in a two home run game against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 28.
2013.
Alvarez was selected to the National League All-Star team. He also participated in the Home Run Derby, where he hit six home runs. On September 13, he hit an inside-the-park home run. He finished the 2013 season with 36 home runs, which was tied for most in the National League and third-most in the majors, and 100 RBI, which was tied for fifth-most in the NL. On October 9, 2013, he became the first player in baseball history to record an RBI in each of his first 6 postseason games.

List of Arizona ballot propositions

The following is a partial list of Arizona ballot propositions.
The initiative and referendum process in Arizona has been in use since the beginning. The first initiative was passed the same year Arizona was granted statehood when on November 5, 1912, an initiative relating to women's suffrage was passed by a greater than two to one margin. The initiative process has long been a staple of Arizona politics, with 15 proposals appearing in the 1914 election, and recently in 2006 when voters were presented with 19.
Prior to 1976, ballot propositions were not assigned a measure number. Since then, they have been identified by a 3-digit number. Ballot propositions beginning with "1" are initiatives and referendums to amend the state constitution, those beginning with "2" are initiatives to amend state statutes, and those beginning with "3" are referendums on acts to amend state statutes.

Arizona ballot proposition

A ballot proposition in the state of Arizona refers to any legislation brought before the voters of the state for approval. 
In common usage, the term generally applies to the method of amending either the state constitution or statutes through popular initiative, although it may also refer to any legislation referred to the public by the state legislature. Most ballot propositions in the latter context are the end result of the normal legislative process regarding amendments to the state constitution. Occasionally the legislature may choose to refer bills of a statutory nature to the voting public, as well.
Origins.
The first instance of a modern US initiative and referral system appeared in Oregon in 1902. This in itself was a product of the governmental reforms that were a signature of the Progressive Era, which sought to reduce corruption and inefficiency. A strong sentiment that current political systems were cumbersome and slow lead to the popularization of the idea of direct democracy. Citizen initiative became highly popular in newly forming governments and thus is widespread in the Western United States.
Itself a product of the Progressive Era reforms, the constitution adopted by Arizona upon admission to the Union in 1912 reflects the sentiment that direct democracy was sacred. The first section of the constitution dealing with the powers of the Legislature is quick to reserve the rights of initiative and referendum for the people. These rights are also granted specific protections, being exempt from veto by the governor as well as not being subject to repeal by the legislature. Citizen initiatives may only be overturned by subsequent initiatives.
Process.
Initiative.
Initiative is the process wherein either the state statutes or the state constitution is amended through citizen action. This process begins when qualified voters (electors) submit a petition outlining the proposed amendment to the Secretary of State. This petition must then be signed by 10% of the registered voters who actually voted in the most recent gubernatorial election for statutory amendments; this percentage increases to 15% for constitutional amendments. If enough signatures are obtained the initiative will appear on the subsequent general ballot for voter approval. A 50% majority is required for a ballot proposal to pass and become law.
Referendum.
Referendum is the process wherein current legislation is referred to the voting public for approval. The legislature may choose to refer any legislation, however any bills proposing an amendment to the state constitution must be subject to referendum. As with an initiative, only a 50% vote is required to enact the legislation.
A referendum on any pending legislation may also be forced by the public in a similar manner to any initiative, requiring a petition signed by no less than 5% of the registered voters. To ensure enough time for any potential referendum, no legislation that is passed may take effect for at least 90 days. 
The constitution makes provisions for the passage of emergency legislation that is not subject to referendum. Such legislation must pertain to the peace, safety or health of the population, or to ensure the continued function of the state government in emergency situations. Such legislation must pass with a 2/3 majority in both houses as opposed to a simple majority.
Criticisms.
As with the citizen initiative process in general, the ballot initiative process in Arizona has been subject to a number of criticisms. Concern that the initiative process is subject to overuse and abuse has increased significantly. In 2006 there were a record 19 initiatives on the general ballot, creating concern that voters could become confused or simply fatigued by the numerous choices. This has led to legislators considering steps to limit or otherwise exert more control over the initiative process. [http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/0213initiative0213.html] Paradoxically, any attempt to alter the initiative and referendum process would require an amendment to the state constitution, and thus in itself be put forth as a referendum.
The extensive use of the initiative process in Arizona is nothing new, however. In the 1914 elections, a total of 15 initiatives were presented to Arizona voters. [http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Arizona.htm]

<doc id="9786283" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9786283" title="Round-trip gain">
Round-trip gain

Round-trip gain refers to the laser physics, and laser cavities (or laser resonators).
It is gain, integrated along a ray, which makes a round-trip in the cavity.
At the continuous-wave operation, the round-trip gain exactly compensates both the output coupling of the cavity and its background loss.
Round-trip gain in geometric optics.
Generally, the Round-trip gain may depend on the frequency, on the position and tilt of the ray, and even on the
polarization of light. Usually, we may assume that at some moment of time, at reasonable frequency of operation, the gain 
formula_1 is function of the Cartesian coordinates 
formula_2,
formula_3, and 
formula_4. Then, assuming that the geometrical optics is applicable
the round-trip gain formula_5 can be expressed as follows:
where formula_7 is path along the ray, parametrized with functions 
formula_8, 
formula_9, 
formula_10; the integration is performed along the whole ray, which is supposed to
form the closed loop. 
In simple models, the flat-top distribution of pump and
gain formula_11 is assumed to be constant. In the case of simplest cavity, the round-trip gain
formula_12, where formula_13 is length of the cavity; the laser light is supposed
to go forward and back, this leads to the coefficient 2 in the estimate.
In the steady-state continuous wave operation of a laser, the round-trip gain is determined by the
reflectivity of the mirrors (in the case of stable cavity) and the magnification coefficient in the
case of unstable resonator (unstable cavity).
Coupling parameter.
The coupling parameter formula_14 of a laser resonator determines, what part of the
energy of the laser field in the cavity goes out at each round-trip. This output can be determined by the
transmitivity of the output coupler, or the magnification coefficient in the case of unstable cavity
Round-trip loss (background loss).
The background loss, of the round-trip loss formula_15 determines, what part of the energy of the laser field 
becomes unusable at each round-trip; it can be absorbed or scattered.
At the self-pulsation, the gain lates to respond the variation of number of photons in the cavity. Within the simple model, 
the round-trip loss and the output coupling determine the damping parameters of the equivalent oscillator Toda
At the steady-state operation, the round-trip gain formula_5 exactly compensate both,
the output coupling and losses:
formula_17.
Assuming, that the gain is small (formula_18), this relation can be written as follows:
Such as relation is used in analytic estimates of the performance of lasers
. In particular, the 
round-trip loss formula_15 may be one of important parameters which limit the
output power of a disk laser; at the power scaling, the gain formula_11 should be decreased
(in order to avoid the exponential growth of the amplified spontaneous emission), and the round-trip gain
formula_5 should remain larger than the background loss formula_15;
this requires to increase of the thickness of the slab of the gain medium; at certain thickness, the overheating prevents the efficient operation.
For the analysis of processes in active medium, the sum formula_24 can be also called
"loss"
. This notation leads to confusions as soon as one is interested, which part of the
energy is absorbed and scattered, and which part of such a "loss" is actually wanted and useful output of the laser.
