Adelaide 36ers

The Adelaide 36ers (also well known as "The Sixers") are an Australian professional men's basketball team that compete in the National Basketball League (NBL), representing the state of South Australia. The club was originally called the Adelaide City Eagles when they joined the NBL in 1982, but changed their name to the 36ers the following year. The 36ers nickname comes from the fact that the Colony of South Australia was officially proclaimed on 28 December 1836.
The 36ers are currently the only team in the NBL based in South Australia. They play their home games at the Adelaide Arena, known as "The Brett Maher Court" within the NBL.
The 36ers' tally of four championships is equal with Melbourne United, and second only behind the Perth Wildcats as the most by any club in the NBL's history.
Club history.
1980s: The Golden Era.
The Adelaide 36ers were born as the Adelaide City Eagles when they joined the NBL in 1982. Mike Osborne was appointed as team coach, Chris Stirling was captain and the team played out of the 3,000 seat Apollo Stadium. The Eagles performed well in their first season but missed the playoffs finishing in 7th place on the ladder with a 15-11 record. The championship was won that year by Adelaide's 'other' NBL team at the time the West Adelaide Bearcats who featured future 36ers in 1982 NBL MVP Al Green, Moscow Olympian Peter Ali and veteran guard Ray Wood.
The Adelaide City Eagles changed their name after the 1982 season to the Adelaide 36ers to reflect on the history of South Australia's proclamation in 1836. Mike Osborne continued as head coach while David Winslow was named team captain. The 36ers once again missed the NBL playoffs in 1983 finishing 6th on the ladder with an 11-11 record.
The 1984 NBL season saw the first time the 36ers would reach the NBL finals, finishing the regular season in 3rd place in the Western Division with a 16-7 record. The team lost their Elimination Final to the Nunawading Spectres 108-101. Following the season, Mike Osborne was not retained as coach.
Former Australian Boomer and 1964 Olympic representative Ken Cole was signed as coach of the Adelaide 36ers for the 1985 NBL season. Under Cole, the 36ers became one of the leagues premier teams. Import players including 6'9" (206 cm) centre Bill Jones, New York-born combo guard Al Green (who had been drafted by the San Diego Chargers as a Defensive back in the 1979 NFL Draft despite not playing football) and an NBL rookie in 24-year old forward from Philadelphia, Mark Davis, combined with local players Darryl Pearce, team captain Peter Ali, young gun Mike McKay, and veteran Ray Wood to help Adelaide to a 20-6 record and second on the regular season ladder behind the Brisbane Bullets. The team had a bye going into the semi-final where they easily defeated for the Newcastle Falcons 151-103 at home in what is still a record semi-final win in the NBL. In the last single game NBL grand final ever played, Adelaide were up against the Brisbane Bullets on the Bullets' home court (Sleeman Sports Centre). Going into the final period the game the Bullets' were leading 78-74 but a 42-21 last period in favour of the home team saw Adelaide fail to win their first grand final going down 95-120.
1985 would see Al Green set a single season points per game record for the 36ers when he scored 31.0 ppg in 28 games played (the record still stands as of 2012–13). Green, who Ken Cole chose to move to Point guard and leave Darryl Pearce at off guard, adjusted to his new role running the teams offense and also led the team in assists for the first time averaging 5.1 per game. Hos form saw him selected to his second All-NBL First Team after also winning selection in 1981 while with West Adelaide. For his efforts during the season, 19-year old guard Mike McKay was awarded the NBL's Rookie of the Year award (despite having already played two seasons with West Adelaide in 1983 and 1984). McKay played all 28 games, averaging 12.9 points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game.
1986 would see the Adelaide 36ers win the first of their four NBL championships. Bill Jones replaced Peter Ali as captain and 6'6" (199 cm) forward Dwayne Nelson returned to the team after a year away, while Ken Cole would win the NBL Coach of the Year award after guiding the team to a 24-2 record, 5 more wins than the second placed Canberra Cannons. The 36ers were undefeated at home during the regular season going 13-0, the first time a club had gone unbeaten at home in league history. The two games the 36ers lost in the regular season were both last second shots against the West Sydney Westars and Coburg Giants respectively. Those two losses ultimately denied Adelaide a perfect season but earned the team the nickname "The Invincibles" (the nickname was given by Adelaide's multi-award winning basketball journalist Boti Nagy). Again earning a bye into the semi-finals, Adelaide this time accounted for the Illawarra Hawks 116-92 before moving onto their second grand final in a row, this time to be played over three games instead of the single game that had been in place previously. Once again facing the Brisbane Bullets, the 36ers won the first game of the series 122-119 in overtime at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre. Back home in Adelaide the 36ers would lose only their third game of the year (and first at home) when they lost game two 83-104. The final game played at home in front of a packed Apollo Stadium saw the Adelaide 36ers win their first championship with a 113-91 victory. Mark Davis finished second in the NBL in total rebounds (15.8 per game), won the NBL Grand Final MVP award and also won selection in the All NBL First Team. The 36ers average winning margin in 1986 was 17.8 points and 25 years later during the 2011–12 NBL season, the 1986 36ers were named the leagues greatest ever team on the NBL's official website.
Despite the on court success there was controversy at the club during the 1986 season with coach Ken Cole suspended towards the end of the regular season by the club board over his smoking of marijuana joint during a road trip to Brisbane, a situation that Cole was open about and never denied. Indeed, he stated that he was recommended it by his family doctor as a way of dealing with health problems and physical pain. After the story was broken in one of Adelaide's daily newspaper's at the time, The Advertiser, Cole was suspended by the club for the last two games and the team was coached by his assistant Don Shipway. Before the playoffs, the players got together and went to the club board demanding Cole's return, going so far as to tell the board that they would refuse to play unless Cole was coaching them. Under immense pressure from not only the players but the general public of Adelaide who supported Cole despite his admitted use of the drug, the club board relented and Cole returned for the 1986 playoffs, though it was known that he would be sacked over the incident at the end of the season regardless of a championship win or not.
Ken Cole, the 1986 NBL Coach of the Year and the 1986 championship winning coach was replaced for the 1987 NBL season by former Nunawading Sectres import guard Gary Fox, who would continue the work started by Cole by coaching Adelaide to their second minor premiership in a row with a 21-5 record. For the third season running the team hard earned a bye to the semi-finals where this time they would face the Perth Wildcats who were in their first ever playoffs. In a major upset the defending NBL champions lost the series 1-2 to the Wildcats. They won 99-98 in Perth but then lost games two and three 99-101 and 93-103 on their home court. After winning the Grand Final MVP award in 1986, Mark Davis would continue to have a major impact on the NBL when he jointly won the leagues MVP award with Brisbane's Leroy Loggins. Davis also led the league in rebounding averaging 17.8 for the season, the first of two times he would do so in his career.
Adelaide finished with their third minor premiership in a row and the second under Gary Fox after finishing with a 19-5 record in 1988 but would again be beaten Semi-Finalists. Bill Jones, who was still playing with the club, was replaced as team captain by Australian Boomers representative Darryl Pearce. Against the Ken Cole coached Falcons in Newcastle during 1988, Darryl Pearce would set a still standing single game scoring record for the 36ers when he scored 48 points including 11 of 14 three-point attempts. 1988 also saw 6'10" (208 cm), Adelaide born centre and AIS attendee Mark Bradtke make his NBL debut for the 36ers. Playing mostly as a backup centre to team captain Bill Jones, Bradtke played in 23 games, averaging 7.4 points and 5.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game.
Both Pearce and Bradtke won selection for Australia at the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, helping the team to finish 4th after being defeated 49-78 in the Bronze Medal playoff game by the USA. Bradtke's selection at age 19 making him the youngest player at the time to ever represent Australia in Basketball at the Summer Olympics (Bradtke turned 20 during the games).
1989 was Gary Fox's last season with the Adelaide 36ers and it saw the team drop to 6th on the regular season ladder with a 15-9 record. Bill Jones left the team to join former coach Ken Cole in Newcastle and was replaced as an import player by 1983 NCAA West Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year and former Los Angeles Lakers draft pick, 6'10" (209 cm) Orlando Phillips. The team had a down year by its recent standards and Adelaide was eliminated in the Elimination Final by their playoff nemesis, the Perth Wildcats. Mark Bradtke's star continued to rise with the Olympic representative winning the NBL's Most Improved Player award. Bradtke averaged 15.0 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game over the 24 game season.
1990s.
36ers long time assistant coach Don Shipway was appointed coach of the team for the 1990 NBL season which was the team miss the playoffs for the first time since 1983 when they finished 9th with an 11-15 record, the clubs first ever losing season. Mark Davis became captain of the team in 1990, a position he would hold until the end of the 1996 season.
Shipway was retained as coach for the 1991 NBL season despite the team's worst ever performance in 1990. The team turned their form around finishing the regular season in 4th place with a 16-10 record. They lost their semi-final series to defending and eventual league champion the Perth Wildcats, missing out on their third grand final appearance. 1991 was the last season that local favourite and former captain Darryl Pearce would play for the club, signing with the North Melbourne Giants from 1992. The season was also the team's last playing out of the 3,000 seat Apollo Stadium which had opened in 1969 as a new venue was due to be opened for the 1992 season.
Adelaide had played at the Apollo Stadium since the team's inception in 1982. However ticket demand was more than double that of what Apollo could hold so in conjunction with the Basketball Association of South Australia (BASA), a new home for basketball in South Australia was opened in 1992 in the western suburb of Findon. The A$16m, 8,000 seat Clipsal Powerhouse quickly became a fortress for the 36ers with every game played in front of a sell-out crowd. However their road form wasn't so good and they dropped to 9th on the table with an 11-13 record. Team members Mark Bradtke and Mike McKay would go on to represent Australia at the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona. 1992 was also the rookie NBL season for Brett Maher who would go on to play a record 526 games for the club and captain the team to three NBL championships.
After their second losing season, the 36ers replaced Don Shipway as coach with Don Monson for the 1993 season. The team had lost centre Mark Bradtke to the Melbourne Tigers during the off-season but gained experience in NBL championship winners, Adelaide born veteran Phil Smyth and veteran 7'0" (213 cm) centre Willie Simmons from the Canberra Cannons. Adelaide improved to a 14-12 record under Monson and made the playoffs finishing in 7th place but were beaten Quarter-Finalists. Local junior Chris Blakemore was named the 1993 NBL Rookie of the Year, while 8th year guard (and future team coach) Scott Ninnis was voted as the NBL's Most Improved Player, scoring a career best 20.1 points and 4.4 assists per game after returning from two seasons in Melbourne with the Eastside Spectres and the South East Melbourne Magic.
The Adelaide 36ers pulled off a major signing between the 1993 and 1994 seasons when they signed the league's 1993 MVP Robert Rose for two seasons. They also had a new head coach in former NCAA coach Mike Dunlap. Finishing in 4th place with a 19-8 record, the 36ers won their semi-final series against the defending champion Melbourne Tigers to win their way into the 1994 NBL Grand Final series against the North Melbourne Giants. The win over the Tigers came at a cost though as team captain Mark Davis's court time was limited in the Grand Final after dislocating his shoulder during the first game of the semi finals. Adelaide went down to the Giants 0-2, losing game one at the Powerhouse 93-95 in overtime and game two at The Glass House in Melbourne 117-97. Robert Rose averaged 32 points for the 36ers over the two grand final games, scoring 33 in game one and 31 in game two. He playing a major role in game one as Adelaide came back from 63-77 down in the last period down to level the game at 84-all at the end of regulation time and most felt that had Adelaide won the series he would have been the leading candidate for the Grand Final MVP award (the award was deservedly won by Giants centre and future three time 36ers championship player Paul Rees).
Despite the departure of Phil Smyth to the Sydney Kings, Adelaide's good form continued into 1995 with the team reaching the semi finals where they were eliminated by their playoff nemesis Perth who had also eliminated them in the 1987 and 1991 semi-finals, and the 1989 elimination final. After the 1995 season and twice winning the clubs MVP award in his two seasons in Adelaide, Robert Rose was let go by the club who claimed that his asking price was too high. Privately the talk was that at 31 years of age, the club felt his best years were behind him. Rumours began circulating around Adelaide at the time that former NCAA college coach Dunlap preferred to coach younger players who still could be taught and didn't get along very well with the teams older players, which led to the departures of Smyth and Rose.
The team had recruited well going into 1996 obtaining forwards Martin Cattalini from the Perth Wildcats and Leon Trimmingham from the Sydney Kings, as well as 2nd year guard John Rillie from the Brisbane Bullets, Despite continued good form which saw the 36ers again make the playoffs under Dunlap in 1996, the 36ers were again eliminated in the semi finals. Following the sudden death of his father after the 1996 season, coach Dunlap return home to the United States and decided to stay there to be closer to his family. The club hired former Gold Coast Rollers coach Dave Claxton as his replacement for the 1997 season. This season also saw Brett Maher take over the team captaincy from Mark Davis, something he would hold until his retirement in 2009. Adelaide finished with a 14-16 record in 1997, finishing in 7th place and missing the playoffs for the first time since 1992.
1998-2008: Phil Smyth Era.
Claxton was sacked as head coach following the 1997 season and was replaced by rookie coach and former player Phil Smyth, despite Smyth's only previous coaching being as a specialist coach at the Australian Institute of Sport during his playing days in Canberra. The club was banking on his years of NBL and international experience to translate into coaching. The gamble worked and the 36ers turned their fortunes around under Smyth and finished the regular season in 2nd place with a 19-11 record. The club head recruited centre Paul Rees from North Melbourne as well as former Denver Nuggets players Darnell Mee (who joined the team from the Canberra Cannons) and Kevin Brooks. They won through to the 1998 NBL Grand Final series against the South East Melbourne Magic where they would win the clubs first championship since 1986 defeating the Magic 2-0, winning Game 1 100-93 at home and Game 2 90-62 at Melbourne Park. Kevin Brooks was named the Grand Final MVP in what was the last ever winter season for the National Basketball League.
Following the 1998 season, the NBL moved from being a winter league to playing during Australia's summer, meaning that seasons would start near the end of one calendar year and finish early in the next. The change in time slot didn't stop the defending NBL champion 36ers though as they finished the 1998-99 regular season with their first minor premiership since 1988 with an 18-8 record. Again winning their way into the Grand Final series, they became three time NBL champions and the first team to win back to back titles in nearly a decade by defeating the Victoria Titans two games to one. Captain Brett Maher was voted the Grand Final MVP and coach Phil Smyth had his second championship in two years of coaching.
At the conclusion of the 1999 NBL championship season, the 36ers were invited to take part in the McDonald's Championship, held at the 12,000 seat Fila Forum in Milan, Italy. The 36ers finished 5th out of 6 in the tournament with a 1-1 record. After losing their first game 79-90 to Brazilian side CR Vasco da Gama, the team won the 5-6 place playoff 91-84 over Lebanese team Hekmeh BC. The 1999 McDonald's Championship was won by NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs who defeated Vasco da Gama 103-68 in the final. To date this was the last McDonald's Championship held.
The 36ers form would continue in both the 1999-2000 and 2000–01 seasons, despite losing star import forward Kevin Brooks to the Sydney Kings for the 99-00 season, though he would return in 2000-01. They were again minor premiers in 1999-2000 with a 22-6 record but missed out on becoming the first team to win three NBL championships in a row when they lost in the Semi-Finals. After falling to 6th on the ladder at the end of 2000-01 and just scraping into the playoffs, the 36ers would again only advance as far as the Semi-Finals before losing to the eventual champions, the Wollongong Hawks. The 2001-01 season was also the last for longtime player and former club captain Mark Davis who retired from playing after 482 NBL games, all with the Adelaide 36ers. At the time of his retirement, Mark Davis was the NBL's all-time leading rebounder having grabbed 5,200 in his career, averaging 10.7 per game. Import Darnell Mee, in his fourth year with the club would win his third consecutive NBL Best Defensive Player award but would be lost to the club at the end of the season due to salary cap restraints.
2001–02 would see the Adelaide 36ers win a then record fourth NBL title and the third for coach Phil Smyth. The team would finish the regular season in 3rd place with a 17-13 record before winning their way into their sixth NBL Grand Final. Facing the West Sydney Razorbacks, Adelaide were victorious two games to one. Adelaide's 125 points in game 3 is the highest ever score in an NBL Grand Final game while they also hit a Grand Final record 19 three-pointers in the game. Adelaide captain Brett Maher became only the second player in NBL history to win two Grand Final MVP awards.
Under Phil Smyth, Adelaide were beaten Elimination-Finalists in both 2002–03 and 2003–04 despite the addition of imports Willie Farley and the debut of local forward Oscar Forman. They were beaten Quarter-Finalists in both the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons. The 2006–07 NBL season saw the 36ers miss the playoffs for the first time since Smyth took over as coach, finishing a club record worst-place of 11th with an 11-13 record. They would again miss the playoffs in 2007–08 finishing in 9th place with a 14-16 record. Following his second losing season, the team decided to replace Phil Smyth as head coach with former player and Smyth assistant Scott Ninnis.
2008-Present.
Ninnis would coach the team for two seasons of a 3 season contract, leading the team to the Elimination Finals in 2008–09. The team, which included local junior and former NBA player Luke Schenscher, finished the regular season in 6th place with a 15-15 record before losing their quarter final 131-101 to the New Zealand Breakers in Auckland. 2009 was also the last season for the club games record holder Brett Maher who was retiring after 526 NBL games and three championships with the 36ers. The 2009-10 season was a disaster however and the Adelaide 36ers finished on the bottom of the NBL ladder for the first time in their history with a 10-18 record. American born but naturalised Australian Adam Ballinger, in his third season with the club became team captain in 2009-10 following the retirement of Maher.
Long serving club captain Brett Maher, who made his 36ers debut on the night they opened the Clipsal Powerhouse, retired from the NBL having played in 526 games for the club, captaining the club to 3 NBL championships (1998, 1998/99, 2001/02), and twice winning the NBL's Grand Final MVP award in 1998/99 and 2001/02. On the occasion of his last home game against the New Zealand Breakers in front of an overflow crowd of more than 8,000 fans, the main court at The Dome was renamed the Brett Maher Court. Maher also played over 100 games for the Aussie Boomers and had the honour of captaining the Boomers at the 2001 Goodwill Games held in Brisbane, becoming the first 36ers player to captain his country.
Following the club's worst ever season, Scott Ninnis was sacked as coach and replaced by former AIS coach Marty Clarke for the 2010–11 NBL season.
Adelaide and Clarke endured a difficult season in 2010-11. They lost guard Nathan Herbert before the season with an Anterior cruciate ligament injury. Further injuries to import guards Troy DeVries and Craig Winder ultimately saw them replaced in the squad. For the first time in their history, the Adelaide 36ers failed to win at least 10 games in a season, finishing with a 9-19 record. They did avoid their second last place finish in a row only because the returning Sydney Kings finished with an 8-20 record. Captain Adam Ballinger was again the club's leading player as he won his fourth straight club MVP award, finished third in the NBL's MVP voting and was selected to the NBL's All Third team.
Things didn't get any better for the 36ers or their coach Marty Clarke in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons. The club finished with the wooden spoon in both seasons and ended each with an 8-20 record, including a club record losing streak of 8 straight games during both seasons. The club was also plagued by a string of failed imports, though most were lost through injury, others either under-performed or were misused by the coaching staff, with the only shining light being power forward Diamon Simpson who posted 12 double-doubles in 27 games. At the end of the 2012-13 NBL season coach Clarke and his assistant coach Mark Radford were let go by the club. There were bright spots though. The emergence of 6'11" (212 cm) centre Daniel Johnson as a scoring and rebounding threat (he led the club in scoring for both seasons and led the NBL with 8 rebounds per game in 2012-13), the signing of former Gold Coast Blaze players Adam Gibson, Anthony Petrie and Jason Cadee, and the emergence of exciting young Victorian Swingman and crowd favourite Mitch Creek (who suffered a season ending Achilles tendon injury in mid 2012-13), gave fans hope for the future.
For the 2013–14 NBL season, the Adelaide 36ers signed the 2007 NBL championship winning coach Joey Wright as their new head coach and added former 36ers championship player Kevin Brooks as his assistant. In desperate need of on-court direction, the club also signed the 2011 NBL MVP, point guard Gary Ervin. After Round 7 of the season the 36ers, led by Ervin and Johnson, were sitting in 2nd place on the NBL ladder with a 7-2 record which included a 5-0 run. This also saw the team sweep both of their games against the Breakers in Auckland, their first wins over the triple defending champions since 2009. During Rd.7 the 36ers underlined their championship credentials when they defeated the previously undefeated Perth Wildcats 91-86 in front of 6,585 fans at the Adelaide Arena, the largest 36ers home crowd since Brett Maher's last home game in 2009.
The Adelaide 36ers have reached the playoffs 21 times in 31 full seasons, and on top of their four championships in 1986, 1998, 1998–99 and 2001–02 they reached the Grand Final in 1985 and 1994. They have also finished as minor premier on five occasions (1986, 1987, 1988, 1998–99, 1999–2000), and reached the NBL semi-finals in 1987, 1988, 1991, 1995, 1996, 1999/2000 and 2000/01.
Sponsorship.
The Adelaide 36ers were previously sponsored by Pura Milk and with the naming rights of Pura Milk 36ers. Before this they were the West End 36ers (as in West End Brewery) during their first title year (1986) while also taking various names from West End products including being known for a time during the 1990s as the Eagle Super 6ers. In 2009 the team was sponsored by Hood Sweeney, an Adelaide based consulting firm and were known as the Hood Sweeney Adelaide 36ers. Other major sponsors include KIA Motors and Sprint Auto Parts.
As of 2013-14, the team's major sponsor is VIP Home Services.
Coaches.
The first head coach of the Adelaide City Eagles in 1982 was Mike Osborne, who would coach the team (renamed the Adelaide 36ers in 1983) until the end of the 1984 season.
As of the 2013–14 NBL season, the Adelaide 36ers have had eleven head coaches, including Ken Cole who coached the team to two NBL Grand Finals in his two seasons with the club (1985 and 1986), including their first ever championship in 1986, the first time the NBL Grand Final was a best of 3 series instead of a single championship game.
American Mike Dunlap who led the team to the 1994 NBL Grand Final series against the North Melbourne Giants, and the 1995 NBL Semi-finals, went on to become head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats of the NBA for one season in 2012-2013, becoming the first person to be a head coach in both the NBL and the NBA.
The 36ers longest serving coach was Adelaide born Australian basketball legend Phil Smyth who coached the team for 11 seasons from 1998 to 2007–08, leading the club to the 1998, 1998–99 and 2001–02 NBL championships. In 1998 Smyth became the first rookie coach since Brian Kerle in the leagues inaugural season (1979) to win an NBL championship, thought unlike Kerle, Smyth had no previous senior coaching experience. His only coaching had been as a specialist coach at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) during his playing days with the Canberra Cannons.
As of 2013–14, the Adelaide 36ers are coached by the 2006–07 NBL championship winning coach Joey Wright, with former dual 36ers championship player Kevin Brooks as the assistant coach.
Ownership.
In April 2006 the 36ers, the Adelaide Lightning WNBL team and the teams home venue, the Distinctive Homes Dome (now the Adelaide Arena), went up for sale due to mishandling of debt owed to the government by the then owner BASA. On 25 July 2006, a consortium of NBL chairman Mal Hemmerling, and Eddy Groves of ABC Learning bought the Adelaide 36ers and the Distinctive Homes Dome for $3.95 million - with Hemmerling in place as owner of the 36ers and Groves as the owner of the stadium. The money for the sale went to the government to wipe out the debt owed by BASA. BASA is now defunct and replaced by Basketball SA - focused solely on all Basketball in SA and no one competition.
In June 2009 Hemmerling sold the team to a group of eight individuals led by new Club Chairman Mark Lewis and new Club CEO Ben Fitzsimons called the Save Our Sixers Consortium.
Home Arena.
Between 1982 and 1991, the home court of the Eagles/36ers was the old 3,000 seated Apollo Stadium which had been built in 1969. From 1985 onward, home games were usually in front of sell-out crowds, but going into the 1990s demand for 36ers tickets was greater than what Apollo Stadium could hold. Additionally, the NBL as a whole was also experiencing a boom with the Brisbane Bullets, Perth Wildcats, and Sydney Kings all enjoying record attendances in their respective cities' entertainment centre's. During their time at Apollo, the Adelaide 36ers reached the 1985 Grand Final (played in Brisbane) and hosted two games of the successful 1986 Grand Final series win over Brisbane. The 36ers final game at their original home was a 102-99 semi-final loss to the Perth Wildcats in 1991.
The 36ers and the BASA built a new home arena in the western suburb of Findon, which opened in 1992. Initially it was thought that the 36ers would move into the 11,000 seat, South Australian Government owned Adelaide Entertainment Centre, which opened in 1991. The Entertainment Centre had been built as the replacement for Apollo Stadium as Adelaide's major indoor concert venue as Apollo was continually being overlooked by international music acts due to its smaller size. However, rather than just be a tenant where they would pay a fee to use the facility and be subject to possible date changes due to pre-booked events, both the Adelaide 36ers and BASA wished for their own venue of operations and play that would serve as the home of basketball in South Australia.
The then-named Clipsal Powerhouse, which has an official capacity of 8,000, was and still is the largest purpose-built basketball stadium in all of Australia. Clipsal would sponsor the venue until the end of the 2001-02 season, after which it became known as the Distinctive Homes Dome in recognition of the sponsorship from Distinctive Homes.
The Dome had been without a naming rights sponsor since mid-2009. However, on 7 February of that same year, before a crowd of 7,800 fans, the main court was named the Brett Maher Court. This was due in honour of retiring long time club captain Brett Maher who had made his 36ers and NBL debut on the night the Powerhouse opened in 1992. He had played all 526 career NBL games for the club on that same court. That day, the 36ers, led by Maher, who scored 17 points in his last ever home game, defeated the New Zealand Breakers by a final score of 102-91. The venue is now (as of 2013) officially known as the Adelaide Arena.
During 2012 and 2013, the Adelaide Arena was in the hands of the Commonwealth Bank after former owner Eddy Groves defaulted on his loan. After much speculation that the venue would be sold and turned into a venue for other purposes, including rumours of the building being turned it into a church (effectively leaving the 36ers without a home venue and the unwanted possibility of playing at the Entertainment Centre or even the 3,000 seat Netball SA Stadium), it was announced on 3 April 2013 that SA Church Basketball and Scouts SA had become joint owners of the Adelaide Arena, ensuring it remains the home of basketball in South Australia and for both of Adelaide's national basketball teams, the 36ers and the Adelaide Lightning (Women's National Basketball League).
The Adelaide Arena is currently the fifth-largest venue used in the National Basketball League behind the 14,856 seat Perth Arena, the 10,517 seat Sydney Entertainment Centre, the 10,500 seat Hisense Arena in Melbourne, and the 9,300 seat Vector Arena in Auckland. Despite poor performances from Adelaide in recent seasons, the team continues to be near the top in NBL average attendance figures.
Mascot.
The Adelaide 36ers team mascot is Murray the Magpie. The Magpie was chosen as the bird is found throughout Adelaide, while Murray's first name comes from the Murray River, one of South Australia's most well known landmarks. Murray wears the teams #36 singlet.
36ers Curse.
The "36ers Curse" refers to the team's long held inability to win games against teams who are either celebrating a milestone, or creating one.
Some examples of the 36ers Curse include:
On 16 November 2012, just one week after the loss to Melbourne, the 36ers appeared to have finally broken their curse when they defeated long time rivals the Perth Wildcats 69-65 in front of a record 11,562 fans for the Wildcats opening game at the new A$548.7 million Perth Arena. However, in their very next game the 36ers Curse returned when Adelaide went down 73-75 to the Townsville Crocodiles at the Townsville Entertainment Centre, giving the previously 0-10 Crocs their first win of the 2012–13 NBL season. The loss to Townsville saw the 36ers embark on a club record equalling 8 game losing streak leaving them out of finals contention.
The first half of the 2013–14 NBL season saw the 36ers finally overcome some of their own curse. On 31 October 2013, the 36ers earned their first win over three time defending NBL champions the New Zealand Breakers since 2009 when they defeated them 96-93 at the North Shore Events Centre. Two weeks later the 36ers returned to Auckland and handed the Breakers their first ever loss at the Vector Arena with a 95-94 win. Just one week later the 36ers handed the Perth Wildcats their first loss of the season with a 91-86 win at the Adelaide Arena. And finally, on 31 December 2013, the Adelaide 36ers scored their first win in Townsville since 2003, defeating the Townsville Crocodiles 90-89. The win over the Crocodiles on New Years Eve also coincided with coach Joey Wright's 300th game as an NBL head coach, as well as being centre Luke Schenscher's 31st birthday.

Retired numbers.
The 36ers currently only have two retired numbers. The are the #5 which belonged to games record holder Brett Maher and the other is #33 which was worn by Mark Davis throughout his NBL/36ers career. Previously the #4 of Darryl Pearce, who holds the record for most points in a single game as a 36er when he scored 48 against the Newcastle Falcons in 1988 and the #15 of star import guard Al Green who played 136 games for the club between 1985 and 1990 hung high at The Dome in Adelaide but were removed by the team owners. There is gathering support amongst local fans to have both Pearce and Green's numbers re-retired by the 36ers. Green, who holds the NBL's single game scoring record with 71 and Pearce, an Olympian while with the 36ers, were the starting Point and Shooting guards on the 36ers 1986 NBL premiership team.
As of the 2011-12 NBL season the Adelaide 36ers have added the numbers of 1986 NBL Championship players Darryl Pearce (#4), Scott Ninnis (#6), Peter Ali (#8), Mike McKay (#10) and Al Green (#15) to the western wall of the Adelaide Arena.
Famous players and fans.
The 36ers have had many famous players in their history with Australian Boomers and/or Olympic Games representatives. Peter Ali, Darryl Pearce, Mark Bradtke, Mark Davis, Mike McKay, Brett Maher, Brett Wheeler, Adam Gibson and Phil Smyth all having played for the club along with former NBA players Luke Schenscher, Kevin Brooks, Jo Jo English, Rick Brunson, Darnell Mee, Robert Rose and Julius Hodge.
Mark Bradtke and Luke Schenscher have played both for the Boomers and in the NBA.
As of 2013, Brett Maher remains the only player to captain the Boomers while still a player with the 36ers. Maher was given the honour of captaining his country at the 2001 Goodwill Games held in Brisbane.
Famous fans include television presenter Grant Denyer, former world number one tennis player, Adelaide-born Lleyton Hewitt and Philadelphia musician/writer John Sharkey III. Multi award winning Adelaide basketball journalist Boti Nagy is also a long time fan of the club.
1986 NBL Championship Team.
The Adelaide 36ers won their first NBL championship in 1986. The team, known as the West End 36ers after sponsorship from the South Australian Brewing Company, had a 24-2 regular season record which included becoming the first team to go through the regular season unbeaten at home with a 13-0 record at the Apollo Stadium. The 36ers defeated the Illawarra Hawks in a one-sided Semi-final before gaining revenge for the 1985 Grand Final loss to the Brisbane Bullets by defeating them in the NBL's first ever three game Grand Final series 2-1.
In 2012 the NBL announced that the 1986 Adelaide 36ers were voted as the greatest single season team in league history.

Rock Art and the X-Ray Style

Rock Art and the X-Ray Style is the debut album by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros, released in 1999. This album featured the band in its first incarnation: Joe Strummer and Antony Genn on guitar and vocals, Martin Slattery playing keyboards and guitar, Steve "Smiley" Barnard on drums, Pablo Cook on other percussion instruments, and Scott Shields on bass. Richard Flack also did engineering on the album. 
The record marked Strummer's re-emergence from a long absence in the music scene, his last record being 1989's "Earthquake Weather". The album begins with "Tony Adams," a track which sounds not unlike Strummer's previous work with The Clash. Saxophone riffs are juxtaposed with reggae inspired guitar, as Strummer recites lyrics detailing a catastrophe hitting New York City. The rest of the record takes a winding journey, with songs that capture Strummer's genre mixing. "Sandpaper Blues" features hand drums and African chanting, "Techno D-Day" dabbles in electronic instruments, while "Road to Rock and Roll," another song written by Strummer for Johnny Cash combines acoustic guitar with turntables and electronic drums. "Yalla Yalla" Strummer himself once described as "an ancient British folk song...written in the year 1999." The song is rich in layers, which includes keyboards, synths, bass, drums, and a guitar with endless sustain (likely provided via an e-bow). 
"Yalla Yalla" and "Tony Adams" were both released as singles with music videos shot for each. The video for "Tony Adams" features Strummer walking down the street of New York City carrying a ghettoblaster. Rancid's Lars Fredriksen makes a brief appearance in the video.
A remastered version of the album along with Strummer's other two Hellcat released albums was released as a special 57 song digital download titled "Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros, The Hellcat Years" on 21 August 2012 to celebrate what would have been Strummer's 60th birthday. Hellcat will also release each remastered album individually on CD and vinyl on 25 September 2012.

Phi Sigma Sigma

Phi Sigma Sigma (ΦΣΣ), colloquially known as "Phi Sig," was the first collegiate nonsectarian sorority, to allow membership of women of all faiths and backgrounds. The sorority was founded on November 26, 1913, and lists 60,000 initiated members, 115 collegiate chapters and more than 100 alumnae chapters, clubs and associations in the United States and Canada. Phi Sigma Sigma was founded to establish to the twin ideals of promoting the brotherhood of man and alleviation of the world’s pain.
History.
Phi Sigma Sigma was founded by ten women on November 26, 1913 at Hunter College, in New York City. The original name for the fraternity was Phi Sigma Omega, but they later learned this name was already in use by another organization. In 1918, Phi Sigma Sigma expanded by founding its Beta chapter at Tufts University in Medford, MA, and the Gamma chapter at New York University, although neither of those chapters are currently active. The sorority held its first national convention that year in New York City, where the constitution was adopted, and Fay Chertkoff, one of the founders, was elected Grand Archon.
Phi Sigma Sigma became an associate member of National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) in 1947, and a full member in 1951.
In 1968, the separation of Hunter College's two campuses prompted the original Alpha chapter to divide. Alpha Alpha was installed at the new Herbert Lehman College in the Bronx, while Alpha chapter remained on Hunter College's Park Avenue campus. Neither is still active.
In November 2009, the Delta chapter, at the University at Buffalo, was reinstalled; making it the oldest active chapter. The second oldest active chapter is the Epsilon chapter at Adelphi University, in Garden City, NY, which was recolonized December 6, 2008. While other chapters were founded earlier and have been recolonized, the Xi Chapter at Temple University is the oldest chapter in continuous existence, having been founded in 1926. The Upsilon chapter (1930) at the University of Manitoba was the first chapter established in Canada.
The official publication of Phi Sigma Sigma is "The Sphinx", which first appeared in 1923.
Symbols.
The open motto is Diokete Hupsala (Aim High). The maxim is "Once a Phi Sigma Sigma, always a Phi Sigma Sigma."
Phi Sigma Sigma's colors are king blue and gold. The official symbol is the Sphinx, while the official jewel is the sapphire. The American Beauty Rose is the official flower.
The sorority's first song, "The Hymn," was written in 1921 by Pearl Lippman of the Alpha chapter and her husband, Arthur Lippman.
The sorority's core values are lifelong learning, inclusiveness, and leadership through service.
Philanthropy.
To facilitate philanthropic activities, the Phi Sigma Sigma Foundation was created in 1969 by Jeanine Jacobs Goldberg, who was the foundation's first president. The Phi Sigma Sigma Foundation provides scholarships and educational grants, as well as leadership programming to collegiate and alumnae members. The National Kidney Foundation was Phi Sigma Sigma's primary philanthropic endeavor from 1971 until 2013. Since then, Phi Sigma Sigma has worked to educate people about kidney disease, as well as organ and tissue donation and transplantation. The Phi Sigma Sigma Foundation was a major sponsor of the National Kidney Foundation U.S. Transplant Games, a national Olympics-style event where organ-donor recipients competed in various athletic competitions.
In 2013 The Phi Sigma Sigma Foundation announced that its new philanthropic cause would be school and college readiness. The cause was determined through membership input via surveys, focus groups and interviews. Members expressed a desire for more opportunities to volunteer locally. Additionally, they wanted a cause that had both international reach and local appeal.
Following the September 11 attacks, the Phi Sigma Sigma Foundation established the Twin Ideals Fund to provide assistance to disaster victims. Named for Phi Sigma Sigma's twin ideals to promote the brotherhood of man and alleviate the world's pain, the fund has contributed to aid organizations in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and Hurricane Katrina.

<doc id="2888041" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2888041" title="Comverse Technology">
Comverse Technology

Comverse Technology, Inc., originally founded in Israel, was a technology company located in Woodbury, New York in the United States, that developed and marketed telecommunications software. The company focused on providing value-added services to telecommunication service providers, in particular to mobile network operators. Comverse Technology had several wholly or partly owned subsidiaries. The name "Comverse" is a fusion of the words "communication" and "versatility".
Founded in 1982, the company went public on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 1986. Led by co-founder and CEO Jacob "Kobi" Alexander, the company originally specialized in centralized hardware/software systems for voice and fax messaging and sold them to telecommunications companies and other large enterprises. Much of its funding came from Israeli government subsidies and tax credits provided to research and development for hi-tech firms. By the mid-1990s, one of its most successful products allowed legal authorities and intelligence agencies to record and store data collected from intercepted communications. Starting in the late 1990s, Comverse's voice messaging software became its main product and the company grew rapidly with the surge in mobile phone use, passing the $1 billion mark in revenues. It established a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market and sold a popular short message service center (SMSC) product. While headquartered in the US, most of the company's research and development was done in Israel; Comverse became one of the more visible success stories in Israel's hi-tech industry. It was one of Israel's largest employers of software engineers, was closely followed in the nation's business press, and was the first Israeli-associated company to join the S&P 500 index.
In 2006, Comverse was involved in an options backdating scandal. Alexander and two other top executives were charged in the US with multiple counts of conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and making false filings. Alexander fled the country to Namibia where he engaged in a prolonged fight against extradition. The scandal proved difficult for Comverse Technology to recover from; the company was delisted from Nasdaq, removed from the S&P 500, and spent the next several years consumed by the costly need to restate its financial reports for several years. Additionally affected by the financial crisis of 2008 and on and changes in the mobile phone market, the company underwent several rounds of large-scale layoffs and sold off parts of its business. By 2011 the company began a turnaround. 
During 2012 and 2013, Comverse Technology divested itself of all its holdings and ceased to exist; the two independent companies that carry on its most well-known product lines are Comverse and Verint Systems.
Subsidiaries.
Comverse Technology had multiple subsidiaries:
History.
Origins.
The company's origins date to 1982 (or 1983, sources differ), when three Israelis, aspiring investment banker Jacob "Kobi" Alexander of Shearson Loeb Rhoades, engineer Boaz Misholi, and Alexander brother-in-law and Columbia University computer science professor Yechiam Yemini, got together and founded an Israeli start-up company, Efrat Future Technologies Ltd. In a meeting in New York, Misholi had the idea of building a business around centralized hardware systems to support voice and fax messaging and selling them to telecommunications companies and other large enterprises, who could then resell the voice and fax services to their customers. The three quickly returned to Israel and started the company, with the goal of securing Israeli government grants to fund the research and development work.
The early years of the company were difficult; in 1984, they founded Comverse in the United States, which became the parent company of Efrat. The name "Comverse" was chosen as a fusion of the words "communication" and "versatility".
In 1986 Comverse went public on the Nasdaq Stock Market with a $20 million valuation; the company used the money so gained as its final round of funding. The three founders had trouble working with each other, and Yemini divorced Alexander's sister; in 1987, Alexander was left with sole control of the company after the other two pulled out. The company was a penny stock on the edge of collapse.
Early successes.
Under his lead, Alexander was credited with turning around Comverse's fortunes. In 1989, the Ascom Group made a $6 million direct investment in the company. In 1990, Comverse won a potentially $10 million contract, its largest yet, to deliver computers running voicemail and fax applications on West German cellular networks, beating out far larger corporations in the process. Deutsche Telekom became one of the company's biggest early customers. By 1991, the company had annual sales of $17 million and was selling a combined voice and fax mailbox system. Many of its early successes came from avoiding the huge telecommunications companies in the U.S. and instead focusing on selling to small- and medium-sized companies in the wireless market in Europe. The company also sought a variety of other markets, including developing countries such as Mexico and China for its Trilogue virtual telephone service. Gradually its product emphasis shifted more from hardware to software.
While headquartered in the U.S., nearly all its manufacturing was done in Israel, where it was able to substantially benefit from government subsidies and tax credits provided to research and development for hi-tech firms and industries by the Office of the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Trade and Industry and by the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation. Many other Israeli companies were built by the same model, including another top software company, Mercury Interactive. During the 1990s, Comverse received at least 69 research and development grants from the OCS program.
In 1993, the company reported a 341 percent rise in profits on revenues in the $64 million range and was named a "Company to Watch" by "Fortune" magazine. However its stock plunged for a while in 1994 after a disappointing earnings report.
By 1995, Comverse was best known for its AudioDisk product, which was sold to overseas clients and allowed legal authorities and intelligence agencies to record and store data collected from wiretaps. Half the company's revenues at that point were from AudioDisk, and market analysts were recommending Comverse's stock.
Growth with wireless.
Comverse became a market leader in voice messaging software and boomed during the late 1990s with the surge in mobile phone use. Much of its market focus was on wireless operators and overseas companies, and it gained a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market. The growth coincided with SMS text messages becoming popular; the first big application for SMS was as a notification mechanism to tell a wireless subscriber that voicemail were stored in a voicemail box. Comverse expanded this application into a full-blown short message service center (SMSC), which receives, buffers, processes, and dispatches all SMS messages throughout a mobile network. Comverse branded and productised this as the Intelligent Short Message Service Center, or ISMSC. Typical of telecomm software, it ran on Unix-based platforms, such as UnixWare and later Linux. Comverse's ISMSC found success as a lower-price solution for lower-traffic networks, where it competed with Logica's Telepath solution. Other companies in the SMSC space included CMG and Openwave. ISMSC found considerable market penetration, exemplified by all six of Hong Kong's wireless carriers using it.
Comverse also became a participant in forming international wireless standards, such as in 2001 for the Speech Application Language Tags (SALT) markup language for XML to add voice capabilities to web-based applications. Additional industry standards groups in which Comverse has been active include the Open Mobile Alliance and TM Forum.
In addition to growing organically, Comverse Technology began acquiring other companies in both Israel and the U.S. It acquired Dale, Gesek, McWilliams, & Sheridan, later known as DGM&S Telecom, in 1996 and renamed it Ulticom in 1999. Comverse Technology acquired one of its key rivals, Boston Technology, for $843 million in stock in 1997. The acquisition gave Comverse entree into the large U.S. telecommunications market and meant Comverse would be supplying voice messaging systems to 12 of the world's top 20 carriers, and left it the third-largest supplier after Lucent and Northern Telecom. In 1999, as it saw record earnings, Comverse formed two wholly owned subsidiaries, Comverse Network Systems and Comverse Infosys, representing the telecommunications services platforms and products and the digital monitoring and recording products, respectively.
By 2000, its revenues were $1.2 billion and it had global operations. It continued to aggressively acquire small companies to fill out its technologies, as exemplified by the purchase of Loronix, Gaya Software, and Exalink, all within a 30-day period in 2000. The company's stock price rose from around $10 in late 1998 to over $120 in early 2001. The company was able to raise money several times on Nasdaq, including once for its Ulticom subsidiary and once (at a valuation of $600 million) shortly before the Dot-com bubble burst.
Comverse was one of the most prominent and profitable success stories in Israel's hi-tech industry, with both "Haaretz" and "The Jerusalem Post" referring to it as a flagship of that industry. As CEO, Alexander was sought out for meetings in Tel Aviv by world leaders such as Chinese President Jiang Zemin. He became known, as Bloomberg News later stated, as "the wizard of Israel's technology boom"; his oft-stated goal was for Comverse to do for Israel what Nokia had done for Finland. Comverse was one of the largest employers of software engineers in Israel and its stock was widely held among the Israeli investing public; as a consequence, the successes and failures of Comverse were always followed closely in the country's financial press. (Amdocs and Mercury Interactive were two other prominent Israeli companies in the enterprise software sector that were also closely followed.)
The company was also quintessentially Israeli in how it was run, with Comverse CEO Ze'ev Bregman in particular favoring a loose, relaxed system in which he knew all the employees and lines of management reporting were frequently bypassed. When Comverse Technology joined the S&P 500 index in 1999, it was the first Israeli-associated company ever to do so. It set the same mark when it joined the NASDAQ-100 index.
The early 2000s recession led to some struggles for Comverse Technology, with the global economic downturn leading to publicly announced profit warnings and a plunge in the stock price in July 2001. Over 3,000 jobs were cut during the period as part of several restructuring efforts.
The company still made some acquisitions, such as buying the instant messaging specialist Odigo for $20 million in 2002, after having previously purchased a 12 percent stake in it in 2001.
The image of Comverse Technology as Israel's blue-chip hi-tech stock suffered, and led to a slide in several other large Israeli technology firms. Comverse's management was criticized by analysts for having issued over-optimistic forecasts, although many other Israeli firms in the industry did even worse or failed completely during this period.
In addition, the European market for mobile voicemail management was already saturated by 2002 and the prepaid wireless market was in decline. In 2002, Comverse Infosys changed its name to Verint, partly to separate its more thriving business from Comverse's struggles, and staged a modestly successful IPO of a minority portion of its stock. By 2002, Comverse Technology had more than 5,000 employees across nearly 40 countries; due to the partial spinoffs and economic difficulties, revenues were down to $735 million.
In December 2001, a Fox News report raised the concern that wiretapping equipment provided by Comverse Infosys to the U.S. government for electronic eavesdropping may have been vulnerable, as these systems allegedly had a back door through which the wiretaps could be intercepted by unauthorized parties. Fox News reporter Carl Cameron said there was no reason to believe the Israeli government was implicated, but that "a classified top-secret investigation is underway". A March 2002 story by "Le Monde" recapped the Fox report and concluded: "Comverse is suspected of having introduced into its systems of the 'catch gates' in order to 'intercept, record and store' these wire-taps. This hardware would render the 'listener' himself 'listened to'." Fox News did not pursue the allegations, and in the years since, there have been no legal or commercial actions of any type taken against Comverse by the FBI or any other branch of the US Government related to data access and security issues. While no real evidence has been presented against Comverse or Verint, the allegations have become a favorite topic of conspiracy theorists.
By 2005, the company had $959 million in sales and employed over 5,000 people, of whom about half were located in Israel. That country held most of the research and development workers, many of whom occupied the company's seven buildings on HaBarzel in the Ramat HaHayal district of Tel Aviv, while business and marketing operations were stationed in the company's Woodbury, New York headquarters.
Options backdating and improper accounting.
In 2006, Comverse Technology was involved in an options backdating scandal. In May of that year, company founder and CEO Jacob Alexander stepped down from his position. Alexander, finance chief David Kreinberg, and former senior general counsel William Sorin (both of whom had also stepped down) were charged in July 2006 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York with multiple counts of conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and making false filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), all related to alleged options backdating or other actions related to stock options between 1998 and 2006. The accusations against the three included the backdating of options to when Comverse stock had been trading at low prices, the use of fake names of option holders, and the creation of secret funds in which to hold the illicit gains. The SEC also filed civil charges against the three, for filing false annual and quarterly financial reports and proxy statements from 1991 to 2005.
By then, Alexander had already fled the country and was classified a wanted fugitive in August 2006 by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. On 27 September 2006, he was arrested in Namibia after hiding in Windhoek with his family, where he had bought a house at a country club. If extradited to the US and convicted, he faced 25 years in prison.
He was released on bail and subsequently engaged in a long, and so far successful, battle to avoid extradition to the US (in Namibia neither money laundering nor options backdating is a crime). Upon leaving the US he had transferred some $64 million to Israel, with most of that ending up in Namibia; another $50 million was blocked by the US government, which overall sought the forfeiture of $138 million of Alexander's assets. In April 2010, Alexander won a victory in the Supreme Court of Namibia that allowed him to continue to live and work in that country until the extradition request is finally ruled upon. In November 2010, Alexander agreed to pay the U.S. government $53.6 million to settle the SEC's case against him, with those monies being targeted to settle assorted lawsuits against Comverse by shareholders.
Of the other two executives, William Sorin pleaded guilty to criminal charges and was sentenced to a year in prison in 2007. David Kreinberg cooperated with prosecutors, repaid $2.4 million to the SEC, and in 2011 was sentenced to the "time served" of the minimal period he had originally been in custody. While over a hundred companies were investigated or charged with options backdating, Comverse was one of the most known cases, and in the words of a pair of financial writers, "Comverse was the poster child for stock option fraud."
Continuing difficulties.
The scandal proved difficult for Comverse Technology to recover from. The three charged executives, who had stayed on as consultants, were fired without severance pay, and the company said it would pursue legal action against them. The board of directors was expanded from five to ten, with all of the new ones being Americans rather than Israelis. A new CEO, Andre Dahan, came on board in April 2007 but the ongoing management crisis prevented the company from engaging in new innovation or entering new business areas. Despite the 2006-2007 economic climate being one of growth, layoffs occurred in mid-2007. Research analysts began speculating that the company might break up.
Because of the accounting issues from the option backdating, Comverse Technology was unable to file full or timely financial reports with the SEC. Its stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market on 1 February 2007, and removed from the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 at the same time. The stock then traded on the Pink Sheets. In 2009, the SEC settled its case with Comverse Technology; the company would not be subject to penalty fines over the backdating matter, but would accept a permanent injunction against itself regarding any future violations of law regarding publicly traded companies. A settlement in a similar case against Ulticom was also reached. The failure to file timely financial reports put the company at risk of having its stock registration revoked; a process deciding this, involving the SEC and an Administrative Law Judge, is still active of 2011.
The financial crisis of 2008 and on caused further difficulties for Comverse Technology, with new layoffs occurring in October 2008, March 2009, and August 2009. The company reportedly lost considerable money in 2009, and the moves were typical of other hi-tech companies caught in the bad economic environment. Some of Comverse's products were still viewed highly; a Yankee Group survey ranked them first in the world in their type of billing services, and they were the worldwide market-share leaders in providing multimedia message service centers to wireless carriers. However, the rise in popularity of smartphones and of sending e-mail eroded the carrier market for some of Comverse's products and services. By 2009, the company's upper management was now largely American rather than Israeli, Dahan was under internal criticism, and there were frequent clashes regarding company culture.
By early 2010, Comverse Technology was planning to finally release an annual report with full financial statements and return to being fully listed on Nasdaq, but still was anticipating more layoffs.
One piece of positive news in July 2010 was an $80 million investment by well-known entrepreneur George Soros.
However, the promised financial reports did not come, and an August 2010 public announcement that the company was short on cash and planning more layoffs and was subject to its stock being completely delisted caused a precipitous drop in the stock's price, with the market valuation of the company falling below $1 billion. CEO Dahan said simply, "These are challenging times."
By August 2010, analysts were stating that Comverse Technology might have to break up by selling off its subsidiaries and spin off Comverse's own business units. Running low on cash, Comverse Technology engaged Goldman Sachs to explore such possibilities, with several large, well-known technology companies potentially interested in Comverse and some private equity firms possibly interested in Verint.
The company had some 4,000 employees, and continued having about half of them employed in Israel and most of the rest in the US and France. The continuing financial reporting problems had cost the company some $500 million in accountants' fees and related costs since 2006 and was the largest drain on its cash position.
The fact that senior management awarded itself bonuses in a time of various rounds of layoffs left employees feeling outraged. Comverse's restructuring also affected its 2006-acquired NetCentrex business unit in France, with layoffs or a shutdown possible. In October 2010, Comverse Technology agreed to sell its two-thirds ownership of its Ulticom subsidiary to a U.S. private equity firm for $90 million; the deal closed in December 2010. The company also sold part of its holdings in Verint, netting $80 million, and sold for $27 million land in the hi-tech area of Ra'anana, north of Tel Aviv, where it had been planning to build a new headquarters.
In October 2010, Comverse Technology finally published its restated financial reports for fiscal years 2005 through 2008. (The company's fiscal year N runs from February of year N to January of N+1.) They revealed that the company lost about $1 billion during that period. In February 2011, the company announced that due to this effort, its report for fiscal 2009 would be delayed, and also that it was restructuring into four independent business units and focusing much of its emphasis on billing systems for mobile carriers. Layoffs also resumed, with more possibly in the offing.
In March 2011, revenues for fiscal 2009 were announced at $1.58 billion, down from $1.72 billion two years previously, with an overall loss of $273.3 million. Dahan stepped down as CEO. During his tenure, Comverse Technology stock fell 68 percent in price and 2,000–2,500 employees were laid off; he made more than $20 million during that time and gained payments of some $5 million upon his departure. Overall, his stint as leader of the company was not regarded positively by some in the Israeli business press.
The new CEO was Charles Burdick, who had been non-executive chairman of the company. Burdick became the first American to head the company.
In April 2011, the company agreed to a $2.8 million settlement with the U.S. government over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that had taken place between 2003 and 2005. Payments of $536,000 had been made to the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization in order to obtain purchase orders and had been inaccurately reported as sales commissions in Comverse's accounting.
Hopes for recovery.
During the first half of 2011, analysts such as Oppenheimer & Co., J.P. Morgan and Barclays said that with its accounting problems largely behind it, some restructuring done, and an improving cash balance and some revenue growth, Comverse Technology was well-positioned for ongoing operations or a possible sale. Zacks Investment Research predicted the company would again show a profit for fiscal year 2011. Comverse itself had gained tens of millions in new business, was hiring again in modest numbers, and was at about 4,000 employees, including some on an outsourcing basis.
In June 2011, results for fiscal 2010 were announced, finally bringing the company current with its annual audited reporting. Revenues rose to $1.63 billion while the company's net loss was halved to $132.3 million, and the cash position was now stated as being sufficient to meet foreseeable needs. Another positive sign for its recovery came when it was re-listed on NASDAQ in September 2011. In April 2012, results for fiscal 2011 were announced; revenues remained flat at $1.59 billion while the company's net loss decreased again, to $58.7 million.
Results for fiscal year 2012 demonstrated a return to profitability, with a net income of $5.1 million.
Restructuring.
In August 2012, a series of transactions were announced that would end Comverse Technology as a functioning entity, by making Comverse Network Systems an independent company once again known simply as Comverse, allowing Verint Systems to buy back Comverse Technology's majority stake, and selling off the other subsidiaries. Burdick said, "Verint agreement, along with the planned spin-off of Network Systems, will result in a tax efficient distribution to our shareholders and direct ownership in two independent, well-capitalized traded companies." Philippe Tartavull was named as the CEO of the newly independent Comverse.
These transactions were completed on 4 February 2013 and represented the effective liquidation of the Comverse Technology holding entity. 
Industry recognition.
Over the years, Comverse Technology won a number of awards within its industry, including:

Mittal Steel South Africa

Mittal Steel South Africa is part of the steel company Arcelor-Mittal. The company was originally Iscor Ltd., a South African parastatal steel company. It was founded in 1928 and was first listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in 1989.
History.
Establishment of the company.
Hendrik van der Bijl, one of the most influential South Africans of the twentieth century, was the driving force behind the establishment of the South African Iron and Steel Industrial Corp. (Iscor).
Iscor, with its first works in Pretoria built by the German Demag, was established as a state company in terms of the Iron and Steel Industry Act, No. 11 of 1928. The objectives of establishing the company were
to produce iron and a range of steel products, and to create employment opportunities.
Production at the Pretoria plant started in 1934. And on 4 April 1934 the first steel was tapped from the open-hearth furnace at the Pretoria Works. Wartime needs for steel and the local manufacture of numerous necessities brought about a sharp increase in demand. Iscor had to expand, and the Pretoria works had reached their limit of growth.
In 1941 Dr. van der Bijl and his fellow directors decided that expansion in a new area had become necessary. The idea of a new steelworks in Vereeniging was revived. For the immediate war needs it was decided to begin by building a plate rolling mill planned in such a way that it could later form part of a large integrated steelworks.
The situation of the terrain along the Vaal River west of Vereeniging made it ideal for development. There was sufficient slope for drainage towards the river and the area was downstream from the Rand Water Board's pumping station intake. The heavy industries could be suitably sited on relatively high ground in a position where the prevailing winds would minimise the dangers of pollution. Dr. van der Bijl convinced the directors of Iscor that the area beside the Vaal River was the obvious site for Iscor's new steelworks.
After the discovery of iron ore at Thabazimbi, the African Metals Corp. (Amcor) was established near Vereeniging in 1937. The erection of the Plate Mill was completed in 1943 and went into production the same year. Iscor started trading in 1947.
Directly after World War II, it was decided to build a fully integrated steel works at Vanderbijlpark, and a start was made on this early in 1947. On 4 October 1952 the Vanderbijlpark Works officially opened by His Excellency the Governor General, Dr E.G. Jansen. Several of the new production units started up in 1953, followed by major expansion schemes in 1956, 1960. From 1964 to 1969 a second development phase started at Vanderbijlpark Works. Large extensions were added; older plants modernised to supply higher quality and value-added products such as electrolytic tinplate for the canning and beverage industries.
On 17 May 1969 the South African Government decided that Iscor's third fully integrated steelworks be erected at Newcastle. The main factor leading to this selection was to decentralise industry away from the Witwatersrand complex and to promote industrial development in Natal, the best watered province of South Africa. Newcastle, as a border area with an adequate supply of labour, and with the Amcor ironworks that could be taken over to save on initial capital costs as well as to provide an outlet for the iron which was at that time being exported to Yawata in Japan ( the contract for which was to expire shortly), was therefore chosen.
Further factors were that Newcastle was situated on main rail and road routes between Johannesburg and Durban, essential services such as water and electricity were already well catered for, and the town had a basic established infrastructure with a settled community. While ore would have to be transported 1 000 km from Sishen, coking coal was available from nearby and the overall economics were favourable. It was decided that both profile and flat products would be catered for in a plant with an ultimate capacity of 8 million tons per annum of liquid steel. Subsequent changes in steel markets has meant that extension to flat products has been delayed indefinitely and the current capacity is about 2,00 million tons of liquid steel.
From 1972 to 1977 the largest expansion period for Vanderbijlpark Works followed. Iron making facilities were extended and the steel making processes modernised by the commissioning of basic oxygen furnaces and electric arc furnaces. A colour coating line established at the South Works and a whole new works – the North Works was established to manufacture wide hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanised products.
1981 saw the corporation arriving at important decisions on future strategy. The looming shortage of scrap in the country and shortage of high grade coking coals led to the decision to place an order for a coal based kiln type direct reduction plant of 720 000 tons/annum at Vanderbijlpark Works.
The metallurgical plants at Pretoria were very old and uneconomic and caused pollution; it was thus decided to phase out the coke ovens, blast furnaces and steel conversion plants, and to replace these with a new facility initially based on scrap and electric arc furnaces with the later addition of an iron making plant. Certain of the obsolete rolling mills would also be closed down and the overall works steel making capacity would be reduced to about 900 000 tons of liquid steel/annum.
The world steel industry entered a crisis period during the end of the 1970s and early 1980s with the widespread recession, which occurred at that time. South Africa did not escape this recession and the local demand for steel fell as a result. A world oversupply situation occurred in the steel market with export prices falling to uneconomic levels. During 1982 Iscor was thus forced into the early closure of the two oldest blast furnaces at Pretoria Works, as well as the closure of the so-called South Works at Newcastle which had been taken over from Amcor only a decade earlier.
Race relations.
The company was created by an act of the Parliament of South Africa to accomplish two things: to manufacture cheap steel (to help encourage industrialization) and to create employment. The company did a reasonably good job of the first task, although it became less efficient in the 1970s as it responded less to market pressures than to the political directives of the government of the day. Approximately half of the workforce was black, and were prevented from carrying out skilled or well-paid labour. White workers were provided with subsidized housing, extensive job training, and opportunities for occupational advancement. Black labourers were given free basic accommodation in hostels so that they could be close to their workplace; however these were extremely cramped, dirty and sometimes crime-ridden. The hostels were not open to families and only males were allowed. This became a political issue during the struggle for a democratic South Africa.
After a series of strikes in the 1930s and 1940s, the company provided white workers with cheap housing, generous pensions and health insurance. After forty years of work, skilled workers were eligible for a 100% pension, including annual adjustments for inflation. Black workers were not eligible for pensions until the 1980s. Blacks never received inflation-adjusted pensions as the company eliminated the pension scheme after it was privatized of the company in 1989.
Operations.
Iscor has become a primary iron and steel producer, with works at Pretoria, Vanderbijlpark, Newcastle, Durban, Vereeniging and Kuils River. Iscor's mining business has been unbundled into a resource focused company, Kumba Resources.
Iscor is closing or mothballing the Pretoria steelworks and linked Corex plant. Shutting the 480,000 t/year steel slabs arc furnace operation in Pretoria will lead to about 1000 payoffs at a cost of about R70m in severance packages. The 360,000 t/year Corex plant could carry on if pig iron exports prove feasible.

Merle Hay Mall

Merle Hay Mall is an enclosed super-regional shopping mall in Des Moines, Iowa, in the United States. Opened in 1959, it is the oldest regional shopping center in Iowa, and was the largest mall in Iowa in terms of gross leasable area before the 2004 opening of Jordan Creek Town Center in neighboring West Des Moines. It was also the site of the deadliest fire in Des Moines' history, which killed ten people in 1978.
Sears, Younkers, Kohl's, and Target are the mall's anchor stores, while Applebee's, IHOP, and Starbucks operate on the outparcels of the mall. Other prominent stores in the mall include Ulta, Old Navy, and Staples. Most of the mall is in the northwest part of Des Moines, but the wing that contains Younkers, Kohl's, and the food court is inside the city limits of neighboring Urbandale.
Merle Hay Mall is independently owned by the Merle Hay Mall Limited Partnership, and the family of one of its original developers continues to manage the mall. A Chicago-based company, Urban Retail Properties, handles the mall's leasing duties.
History.
The site of Merle Hay Mall was originally home to St. Gabriel's Monastery from 1921 until its demolition in 1958. In 1956, the Passionist monks who resided there sold the monastery site to Chicago-based developers Joseph Abbell and Bernard Greenbaum. Abbell, in a 1994 interview, stated that the developers chose Des Moines for their mall because of the city's "reputation as a model urban area in middle America." The mall was known as Northland Shopping Center early in its planning stages until Younkers executives suggested that it be named for Merle Hay, the first Iowan killed in World War I and namesake of the road in front of the mall, instead. Merle Hay Plaza was originally planned as a strip mall before it was redesigned as an open-air plaza with two department stores and four buildings around a common area shortly before construction began in early 1958.
Merle Hay Plaza opened on August 17, 1959. It had 31 stores at the time of its opening, including its first anchor (Younkers), as well as a bowling alley that is still in operation today. A second anchor store opened later in 1959, as Sears moved from downtown Des Moines to Merle Hay Plaza. Other early tenants included a Safeway supermarket (whose space later became part of Sears), Kresge, Bishop's Buffet (which closed in 1995), and Walgreens (which was replaced by an Old Navy in 1999). A movie theater and six-story office building were added in 1965.
Enclosure.
Merle Hay Plaza was enclosed in 1972 and became Merle Hay Mall. Two years later, as Valley West Mall and Southridge Mall were under construction, Merle Hay Mall completed a major westward expansion that doubled the size of the mall. Two additional anchors, Montgomery Ward (which also moved from downtown) and Younkers Store for Homes, were added to the mall as part of that expansion. By 2000, Merle Hay Mall attracted an average of 35,000 shoppers per day.
In a 1994 interview with The Des Moines "Register", Iowa State University economist Kenneth Stone stated that Merle Hay Mall successfully adapted to the changing lifestyles of the 1960s and 1970s by offering longer shopping hours during a time when downtown Des Moines merchants began restricting their hours. Author and Des Moines native Bill Bryson commented on how Merle Hay Mall's opening changed Des Moines in his 2006 memoir "The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid": "My father never shopped anywhere else after that. Neither did most people. By the early 1960s, people exchanged boasts about how long it had been since they had been downtown. They had found a new kind of happiness at the malls." In 1989's "", Bryson wrote that "Jack Kerouac, of all people, thought that Iowa women were the prettiest in the country, but I don't think he ever went to Merle Hay Mall on a Saturday" when he commented on the obesity of Iowa women.
Younkers fire.
The original Younkers store at Merle Hay Mall was destroyed by a fire that broke out on the morning of November 5, 1978. The fire caused an estimated $20 million in damage, and killed ten store employees. The store was closed for nearly a year in order to rebuild.
In early 1979, Des Moines fire officials announced that a hydrogen buildup caused by alkaline water leaking from the store's heating and cooling system caused the fire. Court documents filed by prosecuting attorneys in 1981 stated that an electrical malfunction caused wires that were covered in polyvinyl chloride to overheat, giving off hydrochloric acid. Lawyers representing Younkers and the families of the ten victims sued more than 20 companies that manufactured or were associated with polyvinyl chloride, including Monsanto Company and Underwriters Laboratories. Most of those lawsuits were settled out of court in 1984, while the last suit against B.F. Goodrich was dismissed by a Polk County district judge in April 1986.
Anchor changes.
Merle Hay Mall lost its first anchor in 1991 when the Younkers Store for Homes closed after Younkers decided to stop selling furniture and appliances in order to focus on its more profitable fashion business. Kohl's replaced it in 1993.
In 1998, during the chain's first round of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Montgomery Ward faced eviction from the mall after an analysis by Kenneth Stone showed that Ward was operating a discount store instead of the "first class, full line department store" that its lease required. Montgomery Ward responded by closing in early 1999, and Famous-Barr opened a new store in that space in August 2000, while the rest of the mall underwent a $20 million renovation that year. Younkers moved into the former Famous-Barr space on July 18, 2004, one month after Famous-Barr left the Des Moines market, and the old Younkers was demolished shortly afterwards to make room for a new Target store that opened July 19, 2005. Target's opening ended a period of declining sales at the mall, as sales had decreased by 8 to 10 percent during the first year that Jordan Creek Town Center was open.
Present-day redevelopment.
As of 2009, the mall is anchored by Sears (223,000 sq ft), Kohl's (73,799 sq ft), Younkers (165,000 sq ft), and Target (126,483 sq ft), with approximately 95 inline tenants, as well as a food court and a single-screen movie theater with the largest movie screen in Des Moines. It is managed by Abbell Credit Corporation, the same company that has held a majority ownership interest in the mall since 1959. It has undergone several renovations over time to remain a viable shopping center. According to Elizabeth Holland, the CEO of Abbell Credit Corporation, the Des Moines area is large enough to support only two shopping malls, and the goal of the Merle Hay Mall redevelopment is to make it "become one of the two surviving shopping malls."
On March 10, 2008, the Des Moines city council agreed to rezone the area around Merle Hay Mall into a tax increment financing district in order to help the mall's owners pay for future renovations. The move came as the mall's assessed property value had declined by over $13 million since 2005. Merle Hay Mall's owners constructed a new main entrance to the mall and relocate some retailers to other areas of the mall in order to create space for new "junior" anchor stores with exterior entrances. The former Sam Goody, former Waldenbooks and GameStop (now next to Foot Locker) were renovated to include Staples and Old Navy moved to a smaller store across from their former location to make way for Shoe Carnival and Ulta. As a result of the redevelopment, Old Navy has relocated to a smaller space within the mall. In 2013, Dunham's Sports moved out of the mall, with MC Sports replacing it. The upper level will become a Flix Brewhouse movie theater in mid-2014.

Influenza pandemic

An influenza pandemic is an epidemic of an influenza virus that spreads on a worldwide scale and infects a large proportion of the human population. In contrast to the regular seasonal epidemics of influenza, these pandemics occur irregularly, with the 1918 Spanish flu the most serious pandemic in recorded history. Pandemics can cause high levels of mortality, with the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic estimated as being responsible for the deaths of approximately 50 million people or more. There have been about three influenza pandemics in each century for the last 300 years, the most recent one being the 2009 flu pandemic.
Influenza pandemics occur when a new strain of the influenza virus is transmitted to humans from another animal species. Species that are thought to be important in the emergence of new human strains are pigs, chickens and ducks. These novel strains are unaffected by any immunity people may have to older strains of human influenza and can therefore spread extremely rapidly and infect very large numbers of people. Influenza A viruses can occasionally be transmitted from wild birds to other species causing outbreaks in domestic poultry and may give rise to human influenza pandemics. The propagation of influenza viruses throughout the world is thought in part to be by bird migrations, though commercial shipments of live bird products might also be implicated, as well as human travel patterns.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide.
One strain of virus that may produce a pandemic in the future is a highly pathogenic variation of the H5N1 subtype of influenza A virus. On 11 June 2009, a new strain of H1N1 influenza was declared to be a global pandemic (Stage 6) by the WHO after evidence of spreading in the southern hemisphere. The 13 November 2009 worldwide update by the WHO stated that "of 8 November 2009, worldwide more than 206 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported [503,536 laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 6,250 deaths."
Influenza.
Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is an infectious disease of birds and mammals caused by an RNA virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae (the influenza viruses). In humans, common symptoms of influenza infection are fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, and weakness and fatigue. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, particularly in young children and the elderly. While sometimes confused with the common cold, influenza is a much more severe disease and is caused by a different type of virus. Although nausea and vomiting can be produced, especially in children, these symptoms are more characteristic of the unrelated gastroenteritis, which is sometimes called "stomach flu" or "24-hour flu."
Typically, influenza is transmitted from infected mammals through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus, and from infected birds through their droppings. Influenza can also be transmitted by saliva, nasal secretions, feces and blood. Healthy individuals can become infected if they breathe in a virus-laden aerosol directly, or if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching any of the aforementioned bodily fluids (or surfaces contaminated with those fluids). Flu viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature, over 30 days at 0 °C (32 °F), and indefinitely at very low temperatures (such as lakes in northeast Siberia). Most influenza strains can be inactivated easily by disinfectants and detergents.
Flu spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics. Three influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th century and killed tens of millions of people, with each of these pandemics being caused by the appearance of a new strain of the virus in humans. Often, these new strains result from the spread of an existing flu virus to humans from other animal species. When it first killed humans in Asia in the 1990s, a deadly avian strain of H5N1 posed a great risk for a new influenza pandemic; however, this virus did not mutate to spread easily between people.
Vaccinations against influenza are most commonly given to high-risk humans in industrialized countries and to farmed poultry. The most common human vaccine is the trivalent influenza vaccine that contains purified and inactivated material from three viral strains. Typically this vaccine includes material from two influenza A virus subtypes and one influenza B virus strain. A vaccine formulated for one year may be ineffective in the following year, since the influenza virus changes rapidly over time and different strains become dominant. Antiviral drugs can be used to treat influenza, with neuraminidase inhibitors being particularly effective.
Variants and subtypes of Influenzavirus A.
Variants of Influenzavirus A are identified and named according to the isolate that they are like and thus are presumed to share lineage (example Fujian flu virus like); according to their typical host (example Human flu virus); according to their subtype (example H3N2); and according to their deadliness (example LP). So a flu from a virus similar to the isolate A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) is called Fujian flu, human flu, and H3N2 flu.
Variants are sometimes named according to the species (host) the strain is endemic in or adapted to. Some variants named using this convention are:
Avian variants have also sometimes been named according to their deadliness in poultry, especially chickens:
The Influenza A virus subtypes are labeled according to an H number (for hemagglutinin) and an N number (for neuraminidase). Each subtype virus has mutated into a variety of strains with differing pathogenic profiles; some pathogenic to one species but not others, some pathogenic to multiple species. Most known strains are extinct strains. For example, the annual flu subtype H3N2 no longer contains the strain that caused the Hong Kong Flu. "This e-book is under constant revision and is an excellent guide to Avian Influenza"</ref>
Influenza A viruses are negative sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA viruses. "There are 16 different HA antigens (H1 to H16) and nine different NA antigens (N1 to N9) for influenza A. Until recently, 15 HA types had been recognized, but recently two new types were isolated: a new type (H16) was isolated from black-headed gulls caught in Sweden and the Netherlands in 1999 and reported in the literature in 2005.". The other, H17, was isolated from fruit bats caught in Guatemala and reported in the literature in 2013."
Nature of a flu pandemic.
Some pandemics are relatively minor such as the one in 1957 called "Asian flu" (1 – 4 million dead, depending on source). Others have a higher Pandemic Severity Index whose severity warrants more comprehensive social isolation measures.
The 1918 pandemic killed tens of millions and sickened hundreds of millions; the loss of this many people in the population caused upheaval and psychological damage to many people. There were not enough doctors, hospital rooms, or medical supplies for the living as they contacted the disease. Dead bodies were often left unburied as few people were available to deal with them. There can be great social disruption as well as a sense of fear. Efforts to deal with pandemics can leave a great deal to be desired because of human selfishness, lack of trust, illegal behavior, and ignorance. For example in the 1918 pandemic: "This horrific disconnect between reassurances and reality destroyed the credibility of those in authority. People felt they had no one to turn to, no one to rely on, no one to trust."
A letter from a physician at one U.S. Army camp in the 1918 pandemic said:
Wave nature.
Flu pandemics typically come in waves. The 1889–1890 and 1918–1919 flu pandemics each came in three or four waves of increasing lethality. But within a wave, mortality was greater at the beginning of the wave.
Variable mortality.
Mortality varies widely in a pandemic. In the 1918 pandemic:
Influenza pandemics.
Spanish Flu (1918–1920).
The 1918 flu pandemic, commonly referred to as the Spanish flu, was a category 5 influenza pandemic caused by an unusually severe and deadly Influenza A virus strain of subtype H1N1.
The Spanish flu pandemic lasted from 1918 to 1919. Older estimates say it killed 40–50 million people while current estimates say 50 million to 100 million people worldwide were killed. This pandemic has been described as "the greatest medical holocaust in history" and may have killed as many people as the Black Death, although the Black Death is estimated to have killed over a fifth of the world's population at the time, a significantly higher proportion. This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms, suspected to be caused by cytokine storms. Indeed, symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. One observer wrote, "One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred." The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia, a secondary infection caused by influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, causing massive hemorrhages and edema in the lung.
The Spanish flu pandemic was truly global, spreading even to the Arctic and remote Pacific islands. The unusually severe disease killed between 2 and 20% of those infected, as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic mortality rate of 0.1%. Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults, with 99% of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65, and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old. This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young (under age 2) and the very old (over age 70). The total mortality of the 1918–1919 pandemic is not known, but it is estimated that up to 1% of the world's population was killed. As many as 25 million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks; in contrast, HIV/AIDS has killed 25 million in its first 25 years.
Asian Flu (1957–1958).
The "Asian Flu" was a category 2 flu pandemic outbreak of avian influenza that originated in China in early 1956 lasting until 1958. It originated from mutation in wild ducks combining with a pre-existing human strain. The virus was first identified in Guizhou. It spread to Singapore in February 1957, reached Hong Kong by April, and US by June. Death toll in the US was approximately 69,800. The elderly were particularly vulnerable. Estimates of worldwide deaths vary widely depending on source, ranging from 1 million to 4 million.
Hong Kong Flu (1968–1969).
The Hong Kong Flu was a category 2 flu pandemic caused by a strain of H3N2 descended from H2N2 by antigenic shift, in which genes from multiple subtypes reassorted to form a new virus. The Hong Kong Flu pandemic of 1968 and 1969 killed an estimated one million people worldwide. Those over 65 had the greatest death rates. In the US, there were about 33,800 deaths.
Russian Flu (1977–1978).
In 1977, a strain of H1N1 appeared. It was a "benign" pandemic, primarily affecting people born after 1950, because the older generation had protective immunity resulting from prior experience with H1N1 strains. The 1977 virus was similar to other A/H1N1 viruses that had circulated prior to 1957. The virus was included in the 1978–79 vaccine.
H1N1/09 Flu Pandemic (2009–2010).
An epidemic of influenza-like illness of unknown causation occurred in Mexico in March–April 2009. On 24 April 2009, following the isolation of an A/H1N1 influenza in 7 ill patients in the southwest US. The WHO issued a statement on the outbreak of "influenza like illness" in the confirmed cases of A/H1N1 influenza had been reported in Mexico, and that 20 confirmed cases of the disease had been reported in the US.The next day, the number of confirmed cases rose to 40 in the US, 26 in Mexico, 6 in Canada, and 1 in Spain. The disease spread rapidly through the rest the spring, and by 3 May, a total of 787 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide. 
On 11 June 2009, the ongoing outbreak of Influenza A/H1N1, commonly referred to as "swine flu", was officially declared by the WHO to be the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century and a new strain of Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 first identified in April 2009. It is thought to be a mutation (reassortment) of four known strains of influenza A virus subtype H1N1: one endemic in humans, one endemic in birds, and two endemic in pigs (swine). The rapid spread of this new virus was likely due to a general lack of pre-existing antibody-mediated immunity in the human population.
On 1 November 2009, a worldwide update by the WHO stated that "199 countries and overseas territories/communities have officially reported a total of over 482,300 laboratory confirmed cases of the influenza pandemic H1N1 infection, that included 6,071 deaths." By the end of the pandemic, there were more than 18,000 laboratory confirmed deaths from H1N1. Due to inadequate surveillance and lack of healthcare in many countries, the actual total of cases and deaths was likely much higher than reported. Experts, including the WHO, have since agreed that an estimated 284,500 people were killed by the disease, about 15 times the number of deaths in the initial death toll.
Other pandemic threat subtypes.
"Human influenza virus" usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 are the only known Influenza A virus subtypes currently circulating among humans.
Genetic factors in distinguishing between "human flu viruses" and "avian influenza viruses" include:
"About 52 key genetic changes distinguish avian influenza strains from those that spread easily among people, according to researchers in Taiwan, who analyzed the genes of more than 400 A type flu viruses." "How many mutations would make an avian virus capable of infecting humans efficiently, or how many mutations would render an influenza virus a pandemic strain, is difficult to predict. We have examined sequences from the 1918 strain, which is the only pandemic influenza virus that could be entirely derived from avian strains. Of the 52 species-associated positions, 16 have residues typical for human strains; the others remained as avian signatures. The result supports the hypothesis that the 1918 pandemic virus is more closely related to the avian influenza A virus than are other human influenza viruses."
Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza kills 50% of humans that catch it. In one case, a boy with H5N1 experienced diarrhea followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms.
The Influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are:
H1N1 is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. A variant of H1N1 was responsible for the Spanish flu pandemic that killed some 50 million to 100 million people worldwide over about a year in 1918 and 1919. Controversy arose in October 2005, after the H1N1 genome was published in the journal, "Science". Many fear that this information could be used for bioterrorism.
"When he compared the 1918 virus with today's human flu viruses, Dr. Taubenberger noticed that it had alterations in just 25 to 30 of the virus's 4,400 amino acids. Those few changes turned a bird virus into a killer that could spread from person to person."
In mid-April 2009, an H1N1 variant appeared in Mexico, with its center in Mexico City. By 26 April the variant had spread widely; with cases reported in Canada, the US, New Zealand, the UK, France, Spain and Israel. On 29 April WHO raised the worldwide pandemic phase to 5. On 11 June 2009 the WHO raised the worldwide pandemic phase to 6, which means that the H1N1 swine flu has reached pandemic proportions, with nearly 30,000 confirmed cases worldwide. 8 November 2009 worldwide update by the UN's World Health Organization (WHO) states that "206 countries and overseas territories/communities have officially reported over 503,536 laboratory confirmed cases of the influenza pandemic H1N1 infection, including 6,250 deaths."

The Asian Flu was a pandemic outbreak of H2N2 avian influenza that originated in China in 1957, spread worldwide that same year during which an influenza vaccine was developed, lasted until 1958 and caused between one and four million deaths.
H3N2 is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. It evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift and caused the Hong Kong Flu pandemic of 1968 and 1969 that killed up to 750,000."An early-onset, severe form of influenza A H3N2 made headlines when it claimed the lives of several children in the United States in late 2003."
The dominant strain of annual flu in January 2006 is H3N2. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.
"human H3N2 influenza viruses are now endemic in pigs in southern China and can reassort with avian H5N1 viruses in this intermediate host."
H7N7 has unusual zoonotic potential. In 2003 in Netherlands 89 people were confirmed to have H7N7 influenza virus infection following an outbreak in poultry on several farms. One death was recorded.
H1N2 is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. The new H1N2 strain appears to have resulted from the reassortment of the genes of the currently circulating influenza H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. The hemagglutinin protein of the H1N2 virus is similar to that of the currently circulating H1N1 viruses and the neuraminidase protein is similar to that of the current H3N2 viruses.
Strategies to prevent a flu pandemic.
This section contains strategies to prevent a flu pandemic by a Council on Foreign Relations panel.
If influenza remains an animal problem with limited human-to-human transmission it is not a pandemic, though it continues to pose a risk. To prevent the situation from progressing to a pandemic, the following short-term strategies have been put forward:
The rationale for vaccinating poultry workers against common flu is that it reduces the probability of common influenza virus recombining with avian H5N1 virus to form a pandemic strain. Longer term strategies proposed for regions where highly pathogenic H5N1 is endemic in wild birds have included:
Strategies to slow down a flu pandemic.
Vaccines.
A vaccine probably would not be available in the initial stages of population infection. A vaccine cannot be developed to protect against a virus which does not exist yet. The Avian Flu virus H5N1 has the potential to mutate into a pandemic strain, but so do other types of flu virus. Once a potential virus is identified and a vaccine is approved, it normally takes five to six months before the vaccine becomes available.
The capability to produce vaccines varies widely from country to country; in fact, only 19 countries are listed as "influenza vaccine manufacturers" according to the World Health Organization. It is estimated that, in a best scenario situation, 750 million doses could be produced each year, whereas it is likely that each individual would need two doses of the vaccine to become immuno-competent. Distribution to and inside countries would probably be problematic. Several countries, however, have well-developed plans for producing large quantities of vaccine. For example, Canadian health authorities say that they are developing the capacity to produce 32 million doses within four months, enough vaccine to inoculate every person in the country.
Another concern is whether countries which do not manufacture vaccines themselves, including those where a pandemic strain is likely to originate, will be able to purchase vaccine to protect their population. Cost considerations aside, they fear that the countries with vaccine-manufacturing capability will reserve production to protect their own populations and not release vaccines to other countries until their own population is protected. Indonesia has refused to share samples of H5N1 strains which have infected and killed its citizens until it receives assurances that it will have access to vaccines produced with those samples. So far, it has not received those assurances. However, in September 2009, The United States and France agreed to make 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization.
There are two serious technical problems associated with the development of a vaccine against H5N1. The first problem is this: seasonal influenza vaccines require a single injection of 15 μg haemagluttinin in order to give protection; H5 seems to evoke only a weak immune response and a large multicentre trial found that two injections of 90 µg H5 given 28 days apart provided protection in only 54% of people . Even if it is considered that 54% is an acceptable level of protection, the world is currently capable of producing only 900 million doses at a strength of 15 μg (assuming that all production were immediately converted to manufacturing H5 vaccine); if two injections of 90 μg are needed then this capacity drops to only 70 million . Trials using adjuvants such as alum, AS03, AS04 or MF59 to try and lower the dose of vaccine are urgently needed. The second problem is this: there are two circulating clades of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia. Vaccine research has mostly been focused on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.
Since 2009, most vaccine development efforts have been focused on the current pandemic influenza virus H1N1. As of July 2009, more than 70 known clinical trials are have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines. In September 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, and expect the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month.
Anti-viral drugs.
There are two groups of antiviral drugs available for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza neuraminidase inhibitors such as Oseltamivir (trade name Tamiflu) and Zanamivir (trade name Relenza) as well as adamantanes such as amantadine and rimantadine. Due to the high rate of side effects and risk of antiviral resistance, use of adamantanes to fight influenza is limited.
Many nations, as well as the World Health Organization, are working to stockpile anti-viral drugs in preparation for a possible pandemic. Oseltamivir is the most commonly sought drug, since it is available in pill form. Zanamivir is also considered for use, but it must be inhaled. Other anti-viral drugs are less likely to be effective against pandemic influenza.
Both Tamiflu and Relenza are in short supply, and production capabilities are limited in the medium term. Some doctors say that co-administration of Tamiflu with probenecid could double supplies.
There also is the potential of viruses to evolve drug resistance. Some H5N1-infected persons treated with oseltamivir have developed resistant strains of that virus.
Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead Sciences and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing.
Public response measures.
The Institute of Medicine has published a number of reports and summaries of workshops on public policy issues related to influenza pandemics. They are collected in Pandemic Influenza: A Guide to Recent Institute of Medicine Studies and Workshops and some strategies from these reports are included in the list above.
Phases.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a global influenza preparedness plan, which defines the stages of a pandemic, outlines WHO's role and makes recommendations for national measures before and during a pandemic.
In the 2009 revision of the phase descriptions, the WHO has retained the use of a six-phase approach for easy incorporation of new recommendations and approaches into existing national preparedness and response plans. The grouping and description of pandemic phases have been revised to make them easier to understand, more precise, and based upon observable phenomena. Phases 1–3 correlate with preparedness, including capacity development and response planning activities, while phases 4–6 clearly signal the need for response and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, periods after the first pandemic wave are elaborated to facilitate post pandemic recovery activities.
The phases are defined below.
In nature, influenza viruses circulate continuously among animals, especially birds. Even though such viruses might theoretically develop into pandemic viruses, in Phase 1 no viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infections in humans.
In Phase 2 an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat.
In Phase 3, an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.
Phase 4 is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause "community-level outbreaks". The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with the WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a foregone conclusion.
Phase 5 is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.
Phase 6, the pandemic phase, is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5. Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way.
During the post-peak period, pandemic disease levels in most countries with adequate surveillance will have dropped below peak observed levels. The post-peak period signifies that pandemic activity appears to be decreasing; however, it is uncertain if additional waves will occur and countries will need to be prepared for a second wave.
Previous pandemics have been characterized by waves of activity spread over months. Once the level of disease activity drops, a critical communications task will be to balance this information with the possibility of another wave. Pandemic waves can be separated by months and an immediate "at-ease" signal may be premature.
In the post-pandemic period, influenza disease activity will have returned to levels normally seen for seasonal influenza. It is expected that the pandemic virus will behave as a seasonal influenza A virus. At this stage, it is important to maintain surveillance and update pandemic preparedness and response plans accordingly. An intensive phase of recovery and evaluation may be required.
Government preparations for a potential H5N1 pandemic (2003–2009).
According to "The New York Times" as of March 2006, "governments worldwide have spent billions planning for a potential influenza pandemic: buying medicines, running disaster drills, developing strategies for tighter border controls" due to the H5N1 threat.
Together steps are being taken to "minimize the risk of further spread in animal populations", "reduce the risk of human infections", and "further support pandemic planning and preparedness".
Ongoing detailed mutually coordinated onsite surveillance and analysis of human and animal H5N1 avian flu outbreaks are being conducted and reported by the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, the CDC, the ECDC, the World Health Organization, the European Commission, the National Influenza Centers, and others.
United Nations.
In September 2005, David Nabarro, a lead UN health official warned that a bird flu outbreak could happen anytime and had the potential to kill 5–150 million people.
World Health Organization.
The World Health Organization (WHO), believing that the world was closer to another influenza pandemic than it has been any time since 1968, when the last of the 20th century's three pandemics swept the globe, has developed guidelines on pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The March 2005 plan includes guidance on roles and responsibilities in preparedness and response; information on pandemic phases; and recommended actions for before, during, and after a pandemic.
United States.
"fforts by the federal government to prepare for pandemic influenza at the national level include a $100 million DHHS initiative in 2003 to build U.S. vaccine production. Several agencies within Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) – including the Office of the Secretary, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), CDC, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) – are in the process of working with vaccine manufacturers to facilitate production of pilot vaccine lots for both H5N1 and H9N2 strains as well as contracting for the manufacturing of 2 million doses of an H5N1 vaccine. This H5N1 vaccine production will provide a critical pilot test of the pandemic vaccine system; it will also be used for clinical trials to evaluate dose and immunogenicity and can provide initial vaccine for early use in the event of an emerging pandemic."
Each State and Territory of the United States has a specific Pandemic Flu Plan which covers Avian Flu, Swine Flu (H1N1) and other potential influenza epidemics. The State Plans together with a professionally vetted search engine of flu related research, policies, and plans, is available at the current portal: Pandemic Flu Search.
On 26 August 2004, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson released a draft Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan, which outlined a coordinated national strategy to prepare for and respond to an influenza pandemic. Public comments were accepted for 60 days.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly on 14 September 2005, President George W. Bush announced the creation of the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza. The Partnership brings together nations and international organizations to improve global readiness by:
On 5 October 2005, Democratic Senators Harry Reid, Evan Bayh, Dick Durbin, Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, and Tom Harkin introduced the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act as a proposal to deal with a possible outbreak.
On 27 October 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $62.5 million contract to Chiron Corporation to manufacture an avian influenza vaccine designed to protect against the H5N1 influenza virus strain. This followed a previous awarded $100 million contract to sanofi pasteur, the vaccines business of the sanofi-aventis Group, for avian flu vaccine.
In October 2005, President Bush urged bird flu vaccine manufacturers to increase their production.
On 1 November 2005 President Bush unveiled the National Strategy To Safeguard Against The Danger of Pandemic Influenza. He also submitted a request to Congress for $7.1 billion to begin implementing the plan. The request includes $251 million to detect and contain outbreaks before they spread around the world; $2.8 billion to accelerate development of cell-culture technology; $800 million for development of new treatments and vaccines; $1.519 billion for the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Defense to purchase influenza vaccines; $1.029 billion to stockpile antiviral medications; and $644 million to ensure that all levels of government are prepared to respond to a pandemic outbreak.
On 6 March 2006, Mike Leavitt, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said U.S. health agencies are continuing to develop vaccine alternatives that will protect against the evolving avian influenza virus.
The U.S. government, bracing for the possibility that migrating birds could carry a deadly strain of bird flu to North America, plans to test nearly eight times as many wild birds starting in April 2006 as have been tested in the past decade.
On 8 March 2006, Dr. David Nabarro, senior UN coordinator for avian and human influenza, said that given the flight patterns of wild birds that have been spreading avian influenza (bird flu) from Asia to Europe and Africa, birds infected with the H5N1 virus could reach the Americas within the next six to 12 months.
"5 Jul 2006 (CIDRAP News) – In an update on pandemic influenza preparedness efforts, the federal government said last week it had stockpiled enough vaccine against H5N1 avian influenza virus to inoculate about 4 million people and enough antiviral medication to treat about 6.3 million."
Canada.
The Public Health Agency of Canada follows the WHO's categories, but has expanded them. The Avian Flu scare of 2006 prompted The Canadian Public Health Agency to release an updated Pandemic Influenza Plan for Health Officials. This document was created to address the growing concern over the hazards faced by public health officials when exposed to sick or dying patients.
Malaysia.
Since the Nipah virus outbreak in 1999, the Malaysian Health Ministry have put in place processes to be better prepared to protect the Malaysian population from the threat of infectious diseases. Malaysia was fully prepared during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) situation (Malaysia was not a SARS affected country) and the episode of the H5N1 (bird flu) outbreak in 2004.
The Malaysian government has developed a National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan (NIPPP) which serves as a time bound guide for preparedness and response plan for influenza pandemic. It provides a policy and strategic framework for a multisectoral response and contains specific advice and actions to be undertaken by the Ministry of Health at the different levels, other governmental departments and agencies and non governmental organizations to ensure that resources are mobilized and used most efficiently before, during and after a pandemic episode.

Lyubov Axelrod

Lyubov Isaakovna Axelrod (born Emther Axelrod; , penname Orthodox ; 1868–1946) was a Russian revolutionary, Marxist philosopher and an art theoretician.
Axelrod was born in the family of a rabbi in Vilenkovichi, a village in the Vilna gubernia of the Russian Empire, now in Pastavy Raion, Belarus. She became involved with the narodnik organization at age 16 and took part in unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Alexander III of Russia. In 1887 she emigrated to Switzerland and received her Ph.D. in philosophy from Bern University in 1900.
In 1892 she became a Marxist and joined the Geneva-based Emancipation of Labor group, becoming a close associate of its leader Georgi Plekhanov. When the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks at its Second Congress in 1903, she sided with the Menshevik faction.
In 1906 Axelrod returned to Russia and became a leading Russian authority on Marxist philosophy, second only to Plekhanov. She was critical of both Alexander Bogdanov and Vladimir Lenin during their debate over Empiriocriticism in 1908-1909, branding their ideas anti-Marxist.
In the 1920s she first worked at the Institute of Red Professors and later at the Soviet Institute of Philosophy. In the 1930s her version of Marxism was officially denounced as a "Mechanistic revision of Marxism" and she faded into obscurity.
She died on 5 February 1946 in Moscow.

Chessie (railroad mascot)

Chessie was a popular cat character used as a symbol of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. Derived from an etching by Viennese artist Guido Gruenwald, the image first appeared in a black and white advertisement in the September 1933 issue of Fortune magazine with the slogan "Sleep Like a Kitten." The advertisement makes no mention of the cat's name.
When the ad generated a positive response, the railroad developed an advertising campaign around the image and chose the name Chessie as a derivation of the railroad's name. The promotion proved widely popular and, in addition to national print advertising, grew to include calendars, clothing, and even two children's books about the character. Chessie acquired two kittens named "Nip" and "Tuck" in 1935, as well as a mate named "Peake" in 1937. During World War II, the Chessie character was used to promote War Bonds and support for the war effort, depicted as working on the home front to support Peake, who was off to war. The Chessie image continued to appear in advertising until 1971 when passenger train travel was consolidated under Amtrak.
When in 1972 the C&O merged with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Western Maryland Railway, the newly formed company was named the Chessie System after the popular image and adopted the "Ches-C" logo, which incorporated the silhouette of the kitten into the "C" of the railroad's name. The Chessie System later merged with other railroads to become the CSX Corporation. Though the Chessie logo is no longer found in advertising and was phased out of usage on trains, Chessie is still the mascot of the CSX Corporation, and there are many examples of rolling stock that still feature the kitten logo, having yet to be repainted.

Railroad engineer

A railroad engineer, locomotive engineer, train operator, train driver, engine driver or loco pilot is a person who operates a train on a railroad or railway. The locomotive / railroad engineer is in charge of and responsible for driving the locomotive(s) as well as the mechanical operation of the train, train speed, and all train handling. The use of the term "engineer "to describe this occupation should not be confused with professional engineer.
For many United States (US) railroads, the following career progression is typical: assistant conductor (brakeman), conductor and finally engineer. In the US, engineers are required to be certified and re-certified every two to three years.
In India, a loco pilot starts as a "diesel assistant" or "electrical assistant" (in case of electric locomotives). They then get promoted on a scale: goods, passenger, Mail/Express and Rajdhani/Shatabdi/Duronto. 
In the United States, Canada, and New Zealand, train drivers are known as "locomotive engineers". In the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Australia, they are known as "train drivers", "engine drivers", "locomotive drivers", or "locomotive operators".
Duties.
An engineer is responsible for preparing equipment for service, checking paperwork and the condition of the locomotives. Their duties require that they control acceleration, braking and handling of the train underway. They must know the physical characteristics of the railroad, including passenger stations, the incline and decline of the right-of-way and speed limits. Along with the conductor, the engineer monitors time to not fall behind schedule, nor leave stations early. The train's speed must be reduced when following other trains, approaching route diversions, or regulating time over road to avoid arriving too early. The engineer assumes the duties of the conductor if the conductor is incapacitated.
The locomotive engineer is required to have an intimate knowledge of track geometry including signal placement so as to be able to safely control their train.
Maintaining concentration is of critical importance in this role.
Train handling.
Train dynamics can be extreme and therefore an engineer must be familiar with train handling techniques so as to avoid train partings, derailments and not exceeding maximum authorized speed.
Freight trains typically have different train forces from passenger trains. A typical freight train may have 660 tons (or more) of locomotive weight at the front. That may be followed by 6000 feet (or more) of freight cars. The cars may or may not be uniformly loaded and may brake differently. 
Severe brake applications can combine with these factors to cause a train parting. Therefore good train handling practice for freight trains is usually to keep the train stretched or bunched, uniformly. This is achieved by keeping the train in power while a brake application is made, or by continuous use of dynamic brakes. Transitioning from one state to another (stretched vs. bunched) requires careful handling, and a skilled operator on the locomotive.
When there are Dead In Consist (DIC)multiple locomotives, some may be set up to brake like freight cars instead of locomotives.
On shorter passenger trains, this is even more noticeable, requiring the first application of the brake to be bled off on the locomotive, applying locomotive brakes with subsequent increases in application. The length and make-up of the slowing or stopping distance dictates just how much locomotive brake application should be allowed to apply. Passenger trains utilizing "Blended Braking" do not actuate (release) the application of locomotive brakes. This combines with dynamic braking forces, to produce the maximum amount of safe braking effort, for any given speed.
The use of dynamic brake can result in a severe slack action, when engaged, run in is highly possible if brought in at an inappropriate time (regarding track geometry and train speed) and if disengaged at an inappropriate time can result in a run out. Both can potentially snap train drawgear or couplings.
Stringlining is a potential cause of derailment that train handling techniques must take into account in order to reduce the likelihood of occurrence. When a train rounds a curve basic physics dictates the trailing cars in the consist will try to take the shortest route and the flange on some of the wheels within the consist could potentially fail to prevent this occurring with the resultant effect being a derailment.
Track geometry is also critical to train handling. It is desirable to have brakes releasing at the bottom of steep grades rather than applied. And at the top of a steep grade it is desirable to have a fully charged brake pipe.
Serial braking is where a train descends a grade on the air brake alone. The brake pipe application is gradually increased to slow down and if required (depending on the weight of the train and on the grade) stop the train so as to allow the locomotive compressors to recharge the brake pipe throughout the consist. In these cases it is permissible to use the locomotive brakes (which are independent of the train brake and charged through the main reservoir directly) to hold the train (In some cases the weight of the trailing consist will not be held on the locomotive brakes alone) slowing the rate of acceleration and giving more time to recharge the brake pipe to give a better application in the next subsequent train brake application. A runaway can occur if a brake application is required before the train pipe has recharged (as happened at Cima Hill in the United States).
A split reduction is where a train brake application is made and gradually increased as the train descends the grade. It is different from serial braking in that with Serial Braking the application is released, the brake pipe recharged then reapplied.
The dynamic brake when operable slows down the rate of acceleration and allows longer for a train brake pipe to be recharged before being required to be re applied. When a train descends a grade utilizing both the dynamic and air brakes the procedure is known as 'maintaining braking'.
In the case of severe grades (for example the Westmere Bank in New Zealand, which is a 1:33 grade with a speed limit) a trains allowable speed is lower for a train that doesn't have dynamic brake than for one that does.
In freight train switching yards the freight car brakes are sometimes bled off so they can be easily switched. However when a switching locomotive moves large numbers of cars around with no brakes the locomotive must brake for the entire train. This can result in severe slack action and wheel slip. Damage to goods and rolling stock is possible. There is the potential for loss of control, when switching larger trains without air brakes being charged and applied.
Notable railroad engineers/train drivers.
The United Kingdom (UK)-based transport historian Christian Wolmar stated in October 2013 that the train drivers employed by the Rio Tinto Group to transport iron ore across the Australian outback are most likely the highest-paid members of the occupation in the world at that time.

Richard Grayson (writer)

Richard Grayson (born 4 June 1951 in Brooklyn, New York) is a writer, political activist and performance artist, most noted for his books of short stories and his satiric runs for public office.
Grayson's fiction is largely autobiographical, or pseudo-autobiographical, and his early work was heavily influenced by the metafictionists of the 1970s, such as John Barth, Donald Barthelme, Ronald Sukenick, and his mentor, Jonathan Baumbach, who headed the Brooklyn College MFA program in fiction and was one of the founders of the publishing cooperative The Fiction Collective, for which Grayson worked as an editorial assistant in the 1970s.
Early career.
Grayson was born in 1951 and attended New York public schools, graduating from Midwood High School in 1968. He attended Brooklyn College and received a B.A. in political science in 1973 and an M.F.A. in creative writing in 1976; Grayson also received an M.A. in English from Richmond College (now The College of Staten Island) in 1975. His stories began appearing in literary magazines in the mid-1970s, and in 1979, his first book-length collection of short stories, "With Hitler in New York", was published. In the same year Grayson, active in liberal politics since his teenage years, registered with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as a candidate for Vice President of the United States, receiving coverage for his humorous "campaign" in "The New York Times" and various other media outlets.
He began a long career in higher education as an adjunct lecturer in English at Long Island University in 1975, and has taught English and other subjects at numerous colleges and high schools in New York, Florida, and Arizona. His parents moved to Florida in the late 1970s, and in January 1981 he relocated to Florida also. For several years he divided his time between New York City and South Florida, where many of his stories are set.
By 1979, Grayson had over 125 stories published in magazines and anthologies. He remained a prolific writer in the early 1980s, when several short story collections came out in quick succession: "Lincoln's Doctor's Dog" (1982), "Eating at Arby's" (1982), and "I Brake for Delmore Schwartz" (1983). Grayson's stories from this period characterized by an extreme self-consciousness, an appreciation of wordplay and jokes, and confessions of ineptitude on the part of the author. Most of these stories originally appeared in journals such as "Transatlantic Review", "Texas Quarterly", "California Quarterly", and "Epoch". During the late 1980s he also wrote several articles describing the creative use of credit cards under the pen name "Gary Richardson"
Political activity.
In 1983 Grayson filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for President of the United States as a Democrat. Over the next year, the exploits in his humorous campaign to replace President Ronald Reagan were widely covered in the media. Perhaps his best-known remark, quoted in "Time", "USA Today", and "The Wall Street Journal", was his explanation of why he asked the actress Jane Wyman, star of the then-current nighttime soap opera "Falcon Crest" and the former wife of the incumbent President, to be his Vice Presidential running mate: "She already has experience in dumping Ronald Reagan." Other platform planks in the Grayson campaign included making El Salvador the 51st state and moving the U.S. capital to Davenport, Iowa.
Gay rights activism.
Grayson also worked in the unsuccessful 1994 campaign to defeat an anti-gay rights referendum in Alachua County, Florida, where Gainesville is located. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Human Rights Council of North Central Florida and its political action committee, which in subsequent years managed to help elect enough pro-gay candidates to the Gainesville city commission to pass local gay rights legislation.
Grayson's experience as a lawyer and gay activist informed some of the stories in his 1996 collection, "I Survived Caracas Traffic", whose title story "Kirkus Reviews" called "a resonant meditation on the themes of relationships, AIDS, and mortality." Another story in the same volume is "Twelve Step Barbie," which, along with "With Hitler in New York" is probably the author's best-known work and the subject of academic criticism. "The New York Times Book Review" called the book "far too bright and keenly made to flick casually away." 
Recent work.
Although Grayson had originally published some of the stories in "The Silicon Valley Diet" on early internet sites that featured short fiction, in 2004 he began appearing widely in various literary webzines with his memoirs, satire, and stories. His "Diary of a Congressional Candidate in Florida's Fourth Congressional District," a recurring feature on the website of McSweeney's, covered his 2004 campaign as the sole opponent to Rep. Ander Crenshaw, a Jacksonville Republican, and brought him a new audience.
More recently, Grayson published two short story collections almost simultaneously. The more experimental book was "Highly Irregular Stories" (2006), which Kirkus Discoveries called "an eclectic anthology of intriguing short stories...Grayson’s stories here recall no one so much as Richard Brautigan, who walked a similar line between wit and warmth in his more eccentric novels." The second volume, "And to Think That He Kissed Him on Lorimer Street," which Kirkus Discoveries termed " funny, odd, somehow familiar and fully convincing fictional world," featured more representational and autobiographical stories, mostly set in Brooklyn.
While the literary reference volume "Contemporary Literary Criticism" has called Grayson "a marginal figure in contemporary American fiction," it also noted that "he and his fictional persona seem quite aware of this fact" and that "taken as a body of work, Grayson's short fiction ultimately appears to be one ongoing, career-long writing project, focused always on the effects of contemporary culture on the self."

Jerome Taylor

Jerome Everton Taylor (born 22 June 1984) is a Jamaican born West Indian cricketer. He led the fast bowling attack comprising Dwayne Bravo, Daren Powell and Ian Bradshaw at the World Cup. The West Indies qualified for the 'Super 8' stage of this competition, but did not reach the semi-finals.
After just one match playing for Jamaica, he was called into the West Indian series for the final match against Sri Lanka in 2003. Taylor had been named the most promising fast bowler of the Carib Beer series of 2003, after picking up 21 wickets for a 20.14 run average, which included a haul of 8 for 59, Taylor's first ever ten-wicket match haul.
Taylor established himself in the ODI side with wickets during 2006, and was West Indies' leading wicket-taker during the DLF Cup in Malaysia, with eight wickets. He was selected for the 2006 Champions Trophy and after four wickets in the preliminary games against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, Taylor took a hat-trick in West Indies' opening group game against Australia, becoming the first West Indian to achieve such a feat in an ODI.
With 21 runs required and 14 balls remaining, Taylor had Michael Hussey (then ranked as the world's best ODI batsman) bowled for 13, then dismissed Brett Lee lbw on the next ball. That was the end of the over, but he returned to bowl the final over, bowling Brad Hogg to complete the hat-trick. Earlier, Taylor had bowled Ricky Ponting, the fourth-ranked batsman in the world, for 1, and he finished with four for 49, at the time his second-best ODI career figures.
And in the second Test against Pakistan in Multan November 2006, he got 5 wickets in the first innings for 91 runs.
Taylor joined English side Leicestershire for the end of the 2007 season as a replacement overseas player. His stay in county cricket being paid for by West Indies sponsors Digicel.
Throughout the year 2008, Jerome Taylor has evolved to become the West Indies' premier and most reliable fast bowler, who spearheads a fast bowling arsenal comprising Fidel Edwards, Daren Powell and allrounder Dwayne Bravo. Along with his accuracy and pace, Taylor is reasonably economical and currently has the best bowling average for both Test matches and ODIs in the West Indies team.
Taylor's batting aspect of the game continues to develop for the better. Many believe he has the ability to develop into a useful allrounder. This prospect was enhanced when Taylor scored his first ever First-class hundred, 106 batting at number 8 against New Zealand, in the Dunedin Test Match of December 2008 series.

<doc id="2888093" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2888093" title="Coupling loss">
Coupling loss

Coupling loss also known as connection loss is the loss that occurs when energy is transferred from one circuit, circuit element, or medium to another. Coupling loss is usually expressed in the same units—such as watts or decibels—as in the originating circuit element or medium.
Coupling loss in fiber optics refers to the power loss that occurs when coupling light from one optical device or medium to another. (See also Optical return loss.)
Coupling losses can result from a number of factors. In electronics ("see Coupling (electronics)"), impedance mismatch between coupled components results in a reflection of a portion of the energy at the interface. Likewise, in optical systems, where there is a change in index of refraction (most commonly at a fiber/air interface), a portion of the energy is reflected back into the source component. 
Another major source of optical coupling loss is geometrical. As an example, two fibers coupled end-to-end may not be precisely aligned, with the result that the two cores overlap somewhat. Light exiting the source fiber at a portion of its core that is not aligned with the core of the receiving fiber will not (in general) be coupled into the second fiber. While some such light will be coupled into the second fiber, it is not likely to be efficiently coupled, nor will it generally travel in an appropriate mode in the second fiber. 
Similarly, even for two perfectly aligned cores, where there is a gap of any significant distance between the two fibers, there will be some geometric loss due to spread of the beam. Some percentage of the light rays exiting the source fiber face will not intersect the second fiber within its entrance cone.

Academy of Medical Sciences, United Kingdom

The Academy of Medical Sciences was established in 1998 on the recommendation of a group chaired by Michael Atiyah. Its president is Professor Sir John Tooke. Its objective is to improve health through research and promote medical science into benefits for society.
The Academy's 2012-16 strategy is
Fellowship.
In April 2014, the membership was 1,090 Fellows drawn from fundamental biological sciences, clinical academic medicine, public and population health, health technology implementation, veterinary science, dentistry, medical and nursing care and other professions allied to medical science as well as the basic fundamental mathematics, chemistry, physics, engineering, ethics, social science and the law.
Fellows are elected to the academy for their outstanding contribution to the advancement of medical science, for their application of existing scientific knowledge to innovative health interventions, or for their conspicuous service to medical science and healthcare. Up to 44 new Fellows are elected to the Academy each year.
Honorary Fellowship is offered to those of the highest distinction in the field of medical science, who would not necessarily be expected to participate in the affairs of the academy, but whose Fellowship brings distinction to the organisation.
Honorary Fellows include:
Some of its members are retired and no longer research-active.
History.
The Academy was established in 1998 following the recommendations of a working group chaired by Michael Atiyah, Past President of the Royal Society. The establishment of the Academy of Medical Sciences brought together biomedical scientists and clinical academics within a single national organisation with the express purpose of promoting the translation of advances in medical science into benefits for patients and the population at large. The Academy of Medical Sciences is one of the five learned academies in the United Kingdom, alongside the Royal Society, Royal Academy of Engineering, the British Academy and, in Scotland, the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
The formation of the Academy reversed a UK trend of increasing fragmentation and specialisation within the medical profession and the propensity of the professions to focus on education, training and research within the confines of their individual profession. The Academy established an integrated, national resource, outside the framework of Government, with the expertise and authority to deal with public policy issues in healthcare in their wide scientific and societal context.
In November 2008 the Academy celebrated its 10th anniversary with a special dinner held at the Wellcome Trust.
Following a merger with the Novartis Foundation in 2008, the Academy moved to its first dedicated headquarters building at 41 Portland Place in October 2010.
The Academy's headquarters provides office space for its 25 members of staff and several modern and period rooms that are available for public hire for events and conferences.
Governance.
The Academy is governed by a Council of 24 Fellows including six Honorary Officers whose role is to provide strategic advice to the Academy. The Academy's Honorary Officers are:
Activities.
Policy advice
The Academy’s policy work addresses issues of medical science and healthcare in their wide scientific and societal context. Areas of policy work originate from within the Academy Council and wider Fellowship, as well as in response to consultations from HM Government, Parliament and other relevant bodies. Recent work includes reports on ageing, brain science, addiction and drugs, inter-species embryos, the use of data in medical research and the use of non human primates in research.
Developing the leaders of tomorrow
The Academy's National Mentoring and Outreach Scheme was established in 2002 and is supported by the UK Department of Health, the National Institute for Health Research and NHS Education for Scotland. The programme provides one-to-one mentoring by Academy Fellows for Clinical Lecturers and Clinician Scientist Fellows. It also offers a range of outreach activities for Academic Clinical Fellows, Clinical Training Fellows and MB PhD students.
Funding first class research
The Academy’s funding schemes focus on areas of specific and specialist need. It targets efforts to address shortages within key specialty areas, international collaboration and career development. Schemes include Clinician Scientist Fellowships, Starter Grants for Clinical Lecturers and UK/Middle East Exchange Fellowships.
Celebrating medical science
The Academy’s public events programme has provided opportunities to highlight major scientific and public health issues. Events focus on cutting edge research and provide a platform for discussion of the latest science.
Linking academia and industry
The Academy has a FORUM with industry that brings together biomedical scientists from academia and industry to provide a place for debate on key issues at the industry-academe interface.

<doc id="2888131" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2888131" title="Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland">
Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland

The Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland (BCN) was the government-owned public radio service of the dominion of Newfoundland. Following Newfoundland's admission as a Canadian province in 1949, the BCN was absorbed into the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and its three main AM radio transmitters remain in operation today as CBC Radio One stations.
History.
The radio service was founded in 1939 by the Commission of Government. Later that year, it bought the Dominion Broadcasting Company, owner of VONF (640 AM) in St. Johns, from the Dominion Broadcasting Company (a subsidiary of the Avalon Telephone Company, forerunner of NewTel). Not long after taking control, the corporation acquired two transmitters at Mount Pearl that had been built during World War I as Royal Navy HMS Wireless Station (BZM) for North Atlantic communications with Royal Navy ships. BCN's studios were at the sixth floor of the Hotel Newfoundland in St. John's.
The general manager of the BCN for its 10 years of operation was William Fenton Galgay, who with Joseph Butler had founded the service in 1932. Notable broadcasters also included Aubrey MacDonald, known as Aubry Mac, and the musician Robert MacLeod.
BCN accepted advertising on the station whose programming consisted of commercial, educational and entertainment shows. Notable programmes included future Newfoundland Premier Joey Smallwood's "The Barrelman", which spun information and history with island folklore, and the "Gerald S. Doyle News Bulletin", which interspersed family and community news about islanders with more serious journalism.
In 1943, the BCN opened a second radio station, VOWN in Corner Brook and, after the war, acquired VORG in Gander that had previously been operated by the wartime Canadian military base.
The BCN provided islanders with news of World War II as well as serving as a disseminator of wartime propaganda and as a recruitment tool for the armed forces. After the war, the network provided gavel to gavel coverage of the proceedings of the 1946-1948 Newfoundland National Convention that was elected to determine the future of the dominion. While these broadcasts were closely followed by Newfoundlanders, the loss of advertising revenue from the commercial-free broadcasts hampered BCN's ability to improve its programming.
One of BCN's final acts was to cover the referendums of June 3 and July 22, 1948, on the dominion's future. As the result was to join Canadian confederation, the facilities and staff of the BCN were transferred to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on April 1, 1949, when Newfoundland joined Canada. VONF was recalled CBN, VORG became CBG and VOWN became CBY; all three stations remain in operation as of 2013. Bill Galgay remained as the CBC's Newfoundland regional director until his death.
A CBC Radio comedy series in the 1990s, "The Great Eastern", reimagined the BCN as still being in operation as Newfoundland's own independent public broadcaster, and was presented in the format of a parodic arts and culture newsmagazine show produced by the BCN.

<doc id="2888133" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2888133" title="Jacana, Victoria">
Jacana, Victoria

Jacana is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 16 km north from Melbourne's central business district. Its local government area is the City of Hume. At the 2011 Census, Jacana had a population of 1,940.
Jacana is located north of the Western Ring Road, south of Johnstone Street and between the Craigieburn railway line and Moonee Ponds Creek.
History.
The name Jacana was applied to an area between Broadmeadows and Glenroy in the 1950s by the Housing Commission of Victoria (HCV). The name comes from Jacana Street, to the east of the Craigieburn railway line (therefore, technically not "in" Jacana itself). Both the street and the suburb are slightly to the north of the Jacana railway station, which was built to service the suburb in 1959. However, Jacana as a built landscape did not spring fully formed under the aegis of the HCV.
The streets in the southern section of Jacana were laid out in 1923 when 861 lots were offered for sale on land which had formerly been owned by Duncan Kennedy, a farmer in the area from the mid-1840s. The Housing Commission retitled some of the streets (for instance, the jokingly named Emu Parade and Sunset Boulevard) and built most of the housing stock in this section of Jacana in the 1950s. Only a few houses in Jacana - notably those in Pascoe Vale Road - predate the Housing Commission's arrival in Broadmeadows. In the late 50s a picture of the 'daily needs' shopping centre in Emu Parade appeared in the Housing Commission's "Annual Report" of 1958-9, presumably because it represented the progressive and ever-expanding nature of HCV operations. As the population increased, Jacana Post Office opened on 15 May 1961. The Commission later laid out and built the northern section of Jacana in the early 1970s, the southernmost section of its showcase Meadow Fair estate. A small portion of the southern section of Jacana came under threat in the mid-1960s, when new branch line was proposed to extend from the Broadmeadows railway line close to the site of Jacana Station, to extend to the new Melbourne Airport. This line was not built.
Construction of the newer area of Jacana took place in the Whitlam era, which ended with the opening of the Broadmeadows Sporting Club, located on the Jacana side of the Moonee Ponds Creek Valley. The club was opened by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam on 10 November 1975—the day before his dismissal by the Governor General, John Kerr. During the 1970s a major portion of what is now Jacana reserve was a rubbish dump created to fill a valley containing a small tributary of Moonee Ponds Creek. This area now features two sports ovals. 
As is to be expected from a former Housing Commission development in this region, Jacana is a lower-middle or working class area which, because of its planned heritage, enjoys better amenities than many privately developed or unplanned suburbs. It contains the aforementioned shops and Sports Club (which includes a bowling green), small playgrounds, a school, and extensive parkland. The north-eastern section of the suburb is the site of Broadmeadows Community Health Centre, relocated from a site north of the Broadmeadows Shopping Centre to a space long reserved for a hospital.
Schools.
Jacana boasted a successful primary school (Jacana Primary School - School Number: 4839 & Motto: "Through Knowledge Success"). The school functioned from 1959 until its demise, in 2009, due to the amalgamation of Broadmeadows West, Jacana and Meadowfair North primary schools. Class Sizes were large during its early years, but by its closure in 2009 attendance dropped to below 50 students.
The former school site is currently occupied by the Northern School for Autism (for primary and secondary aged students in the Northern Region of Melbourne, formerly the Preston Special Developmental School). The old school site is undergoing renovations, to the interior and exterior, expected to be completed in 2011.
Jacana Progress Association.
Community facilities in the wider Broadmeadows area were generally the outcome of community agitation through Progress Associations. The Jacana Progress Association was formed in 1959 and concentrated most of its energies on building a community hall. The Association requested that residents donate two shillings each towards this project, and along with a series of local carnivals, had raised $2 000 by 1968. As this was insufficient to construct a hall, the Association approached non-government bodies with aspirations to locate in the area. St. John's Ambulance was the successful 'bidder' for this and was given the money towards a hall on land which had been donated by the Housing Commission to the Association. It constructed the Hall in Pascoe Vale Road, for its own and the community's use. The Hall was demolished in 2012.
The Jacana Progress Association no longer exists, and little is known of the circumstances of its demise.
Transport.
Jacana railway station on the Craigieburn railway line is served by Metro Trains Melbourne.
The Moonee Ponds Creek Trail and the Western Ring Road Trail provide facilities for recreational and commuting cyclists.
Demographics.
ABS 2001 statistics for the Jacana reveal a suburb in which 60.4% of the population is Australian-born - the remainder from a variety of sources, only the United Kingdom (3.1%) and Italy (2.6%) exceeding 2%. In 2001 almost 10% of Jacanaians were unemployed, and 48.5% were not in the labour force (over 30% of the population is under 18 or over 65). Of those employed, almost a quarter worked in manufacturing, and just over 15% worked in retail. 
The majority of Jacana housing, as stated above, was erected by the Housing Commission of Victoria either in the later 1950s, early 60s or in the early 1970s. It is mainly of brick construction with pre-cast concrete elements as per the HCV method of the 1950s-60s. There are no flats. 91.3% of Jacana residents live in separate houses. 48.3% own their own home, and 26.2% are purchasing their home, a total of 74.5%. The average housing price in Jacana in 2001 was $131, 750; today premium streets such as Landy and Freeman Streets command prices over $300 000 as a result of the housing boom earlier in the decade. While this is a major increase over a short period of time, prices in Jacana are still far below the average for Melbourne.
Sport.
Jacana Football Club, an Australian Rules football team, competes in the Essendon District Football League.

Charles Harris (photographer)

Charles "Teenie" Harris (1908–1998) was an accomplished African-American photographer.
Harris was born in 1908 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, the son of hotel owners in the city's Hill District. Early in the 1930s he purchased his first camera and opened a photography studio. He freelanced for the Washington, D.C. news picture magazine, "Flash!". From the 1936 to 1975 Harris chronicled life in the black neighborhoods of the city for the "Pittsburgh Courier", one of America's oldest black newspapers. He was nicknamed "One Shot" because he rarely made his subjects sit for retakes. Harris took more than 80,000 images during his career. The body of his work constitutes arguably the largest and most complete photographic documentation of a minority community in the United States.
Unlike his more celebrated African-American contemporaries, such as James Van Der Zee, known for studio portraits, or Gordon Parks, who traveled widely as a photojournalist, Harris was a working-class photographer tethered to a job with a circumscribed beat. His work was rarely seen outside of Pittsburgh, until after his death in 1998.
In addition to his photo essays of daily life in the city, he captured many celebrities who visited Pittsburgh, e.g. Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billy Eckstine, Lena Horne, Sarah Vaughan, Sam Cooke, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, Charlie Parker, Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis, Eleanor Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Dizzy Gillespie.
Harris also photographed legendary Negro League baseball players of the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords. Harris himself played baseball for the Crawfords when they were known as the Crawford Colored Giants.
He licensed his collection of photographs in 1986 to a local entrepreneur, Dennis Morgan, and subsequently these so-called "Morgan prints" were sold at street fairs in Pittsburgh. Harris filed a lawsuit in 1998 for unpaid royalties and the return of his collection. He won the case posthumously. Carnegie Museum of Art purchased the collection from the Harris estate in 2001.
Since 2003, the museum has scanned and cataloged nearly 60,000 images, many of which are available on the online collection database. Through outreach efforts, lectures and special events, and three Teenie Harris Archive Project exhibitions (in 2003, 2006, and 2009), the museum has asked for assistance in identifying the people, places, and events in the images. In 2011 the museum plans a major exhibition of his work that will tour nationally.
Harris is buried in Pittsburgh's Homewood Cemetery.

Lambdoid suture

The lambdoid suture (or lambdoidal suture) is a dense, fibrous connective tissue joint on the posterior aspect of the skull that connects the parietal bones with the occipital bone. It is continuous with the occipitomastoid suture. 
Its name comes from its lambda-like shape. 
Clinical significance.
At birth, the bones of the skull do not meet. If certain bones of the skull grow too fast, then craniosynostosis (premature closure of the sutures) may occur. This can result in skull deformities. If the lambdoid suture closes too soon on one side, the skull will appear twisted and asymmetrical, a condition called "plagiocephaly." Plagiocephaly refers to the shape and not the condition. The condition is craniosynostosis.
The lambdoidal suture articulates with the occipital bone and parietal bones.

Zoot Horn Rollo

Bill Harkleroad, known professionally as Zoot Horn Rollo (born December 12, 1948), is an American guitarist. He is best known for his work with Captain Beefheart and The Magic Band. In 2003 he was ranked #62 in a "Rolling Stone Magazine" list of "the 100 greatest guitarists of all time".
Biography.
Born in Hawthorne, California, Harkleroad was trained as an accordionist as a child but switched to guitar in his teens. In nearby Lancaster, California, he became involved in local bands. He joined up with future member of the Magic Band, Mark Boston, in a band named B.C. & The Cavemen. Later the two played in the group Blues in a Bottle along with future Magic Band guitarist Jeff Cotton. He joined the Magic Band in 1968 after the departure of Alex St. Clair. After recording "Trout Mask Replica" and several further albums, he left in 1974, with several other band members, to form Mallard. His book "Lunar Notes" describes some of the tensions that contributed to the split between Captain Beefheart and the other band members.
After the disbanding of Mallard, he had a limited involvement with the music community as a performer. He continued his involvement in another capacity, however, as a record store manager and guitar instructor in Eugene, Oregon.
On November 27, 2001, he released "We Saw a Bozo Under the Sea". In 2008 John French (a.k.a. Drumbo) released an album "City of Refuge" in which Harkleroad was featured playing guitar on all twelve tracks. In 2013, Harkleroad contributed lead guitar to a psychobilly track on the Eugene-based band Cherry Poppin' Daddies album "White Teeth, Black Thoughts".

Arch of Triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and International Shrine of the Holy Innocents

Arch of Triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and International Shrine of the Holy Innocents is a proposed Catholic shrine and monument in Buffalo, New York to honor the Virgin Mary and the Holy Innocents.
Origin.
The originator of the idea of the arch, attorney Laurence D. Behr, a Buffalonian, reports the inspiration for the project came to him in a dream after reading an article entitled "The Pastoral Importance of Shrines". The height of 700 feet was chosen because in Catholic tradition 7 is a mystical number representing perfection.
An association was founded in January 2001 in order to raise funds for the project and to organize its construction. The estimated cost of the project is $100,000,000. The initial fund raising goal was for 1 million donors to each give $100. Such donors would have their names inscribed on the arch.
The proposed shrine is intended as an affirmation of the sacredness of human life and an expression of Catholic opposition to abortion.
Design.
The proposed arch would be 700 feet tall, a height which includes a giant gold-colored crucifix on the top, and which would make it the tallest monument in the world. There would be two chapels within the arch: the "Holy Innocents Shrine" at its base and the "Chapel of the Triumph" at the apex.
An artist's conception of the planned arch, based on an early design, showed it to be more angular in its general shape than the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri. A rounder design concept was made available for public viewing in 2010.[http://www.archoftriumph.org/archdesign.html As with the Gateway Arch, people would be able to ascend the inside of the monument.
The proposed arch would be located in the Outer Harbor of Buffalo, New York on the shores of Lake Erie.
Reactions.
The reception of the initial proposal was mixed. The Buffalo News while praising the ideals of the project suggested that the money used for construction could be better spent, and cautioned that such an attraction might be divisive within the community and a magnet for outside actors to sow division.
In 2002, the Buffalo Common Council unanimously passed a resolution in favor of the arch. In the resolution, the Council cited the arch's potential economic impact on the region, the fact that most Buffalonians are Catholic, and the commitment of the shrine association to cooperate with the Council in order to make the structure an attractive addition to the city skyline.

<doc id="2888193" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2888193" title="Triệu dynasty">
Triệu dynasty

The Triệu dynasty (; 家赵) ruled the kingdom of Nam Việt ("South Yuè"), which consisted of parts of southern China as well as northern Vietnam. Its capital was Panyu, in modern Guangzhou. The founder of the dynasty, called Triệu Đà or Zhao Tuo, was a military governor for the Qin Empire. He asserted his independence in 207 BC when the Qin collapsed. The ruling elite included both ethnic Chinese and native Yue, with intermarriage and assimilation encouraged. Triệu Đà conquered the Vietnamese state of Âu Lạc and led a coalition of Yuè states in a war against the Han Empire, which had been expanding southward. Subsequent rulers were less successful in asserting their independence and the Han conquered the kingdom in 111 BC.
In Vietnamese historiography, this dynasty was a government of the Vietnamese nation, and its end marks the beginning of the First Chinese Domination (111 BC – 39 AD). The modern name "Vietnam" is derived from "Nam Việt". However, Chinese-oriented historians regard the Triệu as a Chinese dynasty and thus consider this a period of Chinese rule over Vietnam.
Historiography.
The scholar Huang Zuo produced the first detailed published history of Nam Việt in the fifteenth century. Chinese historians have generally denounced the Triệu as separatists from the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), but have also praised them as a civilizing force. A particularly strident denunciation was produced by poet Qu Dajun in 1696. Qu praised Qin Shi Huang as a model of how to uphold the purity of Chinese culture, and compared Triệu Đà unfavorably to the emperor. A more positive view of Triệu multiculturalism was presented by Liang Tíngnan in "Nányuè Wŭ Wáng Chuán" (History of the Five Kings of Nanyue) in 1833. The Cantonese traditionally reject or minimize any connection to Nam Việt with implausible stories that assert pure northern Chinese ancestry. Despite this, the Cantonese refer to themselves as "Yuht", the Cantonese pronunciation of Yuè/Việt. In modern times, the character (yuè) refers to Cantonese while (yuè) refers to Vietnamese. But historically, these two characters were interchangeable.
Meanwhile, Vietnamese historians have struggled with the issue of whether to regard the Triệu heroically as founders of Vietnam, or to denounce them as foreign invaders. For centuries afterward, Triệu Đà was a folk hero among the Viets, and was remembered for standing up to the Han Empire. After Lý Bí drove the Chinese out of northern Vietnam, he proclaimed himself "emperor of Nam Việt" ("Nam Việt đế") in 544, thus identifying his state as a revival of the Trieu, despite obvious differences in terms of location and ethnic makeup. In the thirteenth century, Lê Văn Hưu wrote a history of Vietnam that used the Triệu as its starting point, with Triệu Đà receiving glowing praise as Vietnam's first emperor. In the 18th century, Ngô Thì Sĩ reevaluated Triệu Đà as a foreign invader. Under the Nguyễn Dynasty, Triệu Đà continued to receive high praise, although it was acknowledged that the original Nam Việtwas not in fact a Vietnamese state. The current Communist government portrays Triệu Đà negatively as a foreign invader who vanquished Vietnam's heroic King An Dương. Modern Vietnamese are descended from the ancient Yue of northern Vietnam and western Guangdong, according to Peter Bellwood.
Triệu Đà "or" Zhao Tuo.
Triệu Đà (r. 204-136 BC), the founder of the dynasty, was an ethnic Chinese born in the Kingdom of Zhao, now Hebei province. He became military governor of Nanhai (now Guangdong) upon the death of Governor Ren Xiao in 208 BC, just as the Qin Empire was collapsing. The Qin Governor of Canton advised Triệu to found his own independent kingdom since the area was remote and there were many Chinese settlers in the area. He asserted Nanhai's independence declared himself the king of Nam Việt in 204 BC, established in the area of Lingnan, the modern provinces of comprises Guangdong, Guangxi, south Hunan, south Jiangxi and other nearby areas. He ruled Nam Việt and committed acts of defiance against Emperor Gaozu of Han and he severed all ties with China, killed many Chinese employees appointed by the central government and favored local customs. Being a talented general and cunning diplomat, he sought a peaceful relationship with China, both with the Qin Empire and the succeeding Han Empire.
In 196 BC, Emperor Gaozu sent the scholar Lu Jia to the court of Triệu Đà. On this occasion, Triệu Đà squatted and wore his hair in a bun, in the Yuè manner.
"You are a Chinese and your forefathers and kin lie buried in Zhending in the land of Zhao", Lu told the king. "Yet now you turn against that nature which heaven has given you at birth, cast aside the dress of your native land and, with this tiny, far-off land of Yue, think to set yourself up as a rival to the Son of Heaven and an enemy state...It is proper under such circumstances that you should advance as far as the suburbs to greet me and bow to the north and refer to yourself as a 'subject'." After Lu threatened a Han military attack on Nam Việt, Triệu Đà stood up and apologized. Lu stayed at Panyu for several months and Triệu Đà delighted in his company. "There is no one in all Yue worth talking to", said the king, "Now that you have come, everyday I hear something I have never heard before!" Lǔ recognized Triệu Đà as "king of Yue". An agreement was reached that allowed legal trade between the Han Empire and Nam Việt, as the people of Nam Việt were anxious to purchase iron vessels from China. When Lǔ returned to Chang'an, Emperor Gaozu was much pleased by this result.
Lü Zhi, the Han dowager empress, banned trade with Nam Việt in 185 BC. "Emperor Gaozu set me up as a feudal lord and sent his envoy giving me permission to carry on trade," said Triệu Đà. "But now Empress Lu... treating me like one of the barbarians and breaking off our trade in iron vessels and goods." Triệu Đà responded by declaring himself an emperor and by attacking some border towns. His imperial status was recognized by the Minyue, Western Ou, and the Luolou. The army sent against Nam Việt by Empress Lǚ was ravaged by a cholera epidemic. When Triệu Đà was reconciled with the Han Empire in 180 BC, he sent a message to Emperor Wu of Han in which he described himself as, "Your aged subject Tuo, a barbarian chief". Triệu Đà agreed to recognize the Han ruler as the only emperor.
Peace meant that Nam Việt lost its imperial authority over the other Yue states. Its earlier empire had not been based on supremacy, but was instead a framework for a wartime military alliance opposed to the Han. The army Triệu Đà had created to oppose the Han was now available to deploy against the Âu Lạc kingdom in northern Vietnam. This kingdom was conquered in 179-180 BC. Triệu Đà divided his kingdom into two regions: Cửu Chân and Giao Chỉ. Giao Chỉ now encompasses most of northern Vietnam. He allowed each region to have representatives to the central government, thus his administration was quite relaxed and had a feeling of being decentralized. However, he remained in control. By the time Triệu Đà died in 136 BC, he had ruled for more than 70 years and outlived his sons.
In modern Vietnam, Triệu Đà is best remembered as a character in the "Legend of the Magic Crossbow". According to this legend, Triệu Đà's son Trong Thủy married Mỵ Châu, the daughter of King An Dương of Âu Lạc, and used her love to steal the secret of An Dương's magic crossbow.
Triệu Văn "or" Zhao Mo.
Triệu Đà died in 136 BC and was succeeded by his grandson, who took the temple name Triệu Văn (). Triệu Văn was the son of Trọng Thủy and Mỵ Châu, according the Legend of the Magic Crossbow. He was 71 years old at the time. In 135 BC, the Minyue attacked and Triệu Văn requested the assistance of the Han Empire. Emperor Wu offered to "help" by sending his army, ostensibly to suppress the assist Nam Việt, but with an eye of seizing the country should an occasion arise. Crown Prince Triệu Anh Tề was sent to live and study in the Hàn court. The king took this as a gesture of goodwill by the emperor, whom he viewed as a brother, to strengthen the relationship between Han and Nam Việt. Triệu Văn died in 124 BC. His mausoleum was found in Guangzhou in 1983.
Triệu Minh Vương "or" Zhao Ming Di.
Triệu Anh Te (r. 124-112 BC) was the crown prince when his father, Triệu Vǎn Vương, died. Triệu Anh Te's appointment to the position of Triệu Minh Vương (Emperor Zhao Ming) was a conciliatory measure to the Emperor in Chang'an as a sign of respect. This crowned prince, Triệu Anh Te, lived most of his life in China. In China he had fathered a son by an ethnic Chinese woman name Cu Thi; In one popular theory, she was Emperor Wu's own daughter. He named the son Triệu Hưng. Only when his father, Triệu Văn Vương, died did Triệu Anh Te receive permission to go home for his father's funeral. This happened in 124 BC. Triệu Anh Te ascended the throne as Triệu Minh Vương. Not much is known about Triệu Minh Vương's reign, probably because it is a short one and he was subservient to the Han emperor. His Chinese-born son, Triệu Hưng, was only about 6 years old when Triệu Minh Vương died. Owing to Triệu Hưng's extreme youth, his mother Cu Thi, became the Empress Dowager.
Triệu Minh Vương's death precipitated the events that would lead to the seizure and domination of Nam Việt by the Hán forces.
Triệu Ai Vương "or" Zhao Ai Di.
Triệu Hưng (r. 113-112 BC), just 6 years old, ascended the throne and adopted the temple name Triệu Ai Vương. Soon thereafter, Emperor Wu of Han summoned him and his mother, Cu Thi, to an audience to pay homage in the Hán court. The Han held Cu Thi and Triệu Ai under the pretext that the young emperor needed their protection. By acquiescing to this gesture, both the empress dowager and the young emperor gave the public the impression that they were just puppets in the hands of the Hán court. With Triệu Ai in their hands and the empress dowager beheaded, the Chinese prepared their army for an invasion. In 112 BC, the emperor sent two of his commanders, Lo Bac Duc and Duong Boc, along with 5,000 of his best soldiers to invade Nam Việt.
Triệu Dương Vương "or" Zhao Yang Di.
Nam Việt's senior prime minister, Quan Thai-pho, Lữ Gia (Lü Jia) sent out the army to meet the Hán at the border to repel the invasion. The army was strong, but smaller in number. Meanwhile, inside the country, the word has spread that Triệu Dương Vương was in the hand of the Han emperor. The Việt feared that if they resist, their Emperor would be harm by the hands of the Han Emperor. The country was now in a state of chaos. When the Han kept sending more and more reinforcements for his army at the border, the Nam Việt's army was unable to hold their position. Lữ Gia saw that Nam Việt must have a new king in order to calm its people and to stir up Nam Việt patriotism to fight. Triệu Kiến Ðức, Triệu Minh Vương's eldest son from one of his concubines, took the burden of leading his people to war. Triệu Kiến Ðức took the title of Triệu Dương Vương (Emperor Zhao Yang) (ca. 111 BC).
Decline of the dynasty.
Emperor Wu of Han dispatched soldiers against Nam Việt. With its king being too young and inexperienced and leading an untrained, however brave army, Nam Việt was only able to keep their stronghold for a while. Hán crushed the Nam Việt army along with Lữ Gia (Lü Jia) and his King (Triệu Dương Vương), both resisted until the end. Nam Việt as the prefecture of Giao Chỉ (Jiaozhi) of the Han Empire, was divided into nine districts. Han dynasty would dominate Jiaozhi until the revolt of the Trưng Sisters, who led a revolt in 40.
Southern Triệu.
By the 14th century book Lĩnh Nam Chích Quái (""Mysterious tales of the Southern Realm""), Triệu dynasty bloodline fled to present-day Hà Tĩnh Province, founded the Nam Chieu/Nam Triệu (Southern Triệu ) kingdom and lasted until the Jin Dynasty (265–420).
Nam Việt/Nanyue culture.
There was a fusion of the Han and Yue cultures in significant ways, as shown by the artifacts unearthed by archaeologists from the tomb of Nanyue in Guangzhou. The imperial Nanyue tomb in Guangzhou is extremely rich. There are quite a number of bronzes that show cultural influences from the Han, Chu, Yue and Ordos regions.

Tommy Mooney

Thomas John "Tommy" Mooney (born 11 August 1971) is an English former professional football player who played as a striker.
Career.
Early career.
Mooney began his professional career at Aston Villa, but was released in 1990 without ever playing for the first team. Mooney then joined Scarborough, where he made a name for himself, scoring 40 goals in 129 first-team appearances. After three years at Scarborough, he moved to Southend United for a reported £100,000.
Watford.
After just one season at Southend he arrived at Watford – initially on loan, before eventually signing for £95,000 in July 1994 as a 'makeweight' alongside midfielder Derek Payne, with Keith Dublin moving in the opposite direction. 
In his early days at the club, under manager Glenn Roeder, he failed to cement a successful striking partnership with Jamie Moralee and soon found himself in the reserves or on the bench. He eventually ended up playing as part of the defensive line during the Second Division championship-winning campaign of 1997–98.
Mooney started the 1998–99 season in a defensive role, but slipped out of the side as Watford reverted to 4–4–2. Meanwhile Watford, after a good start, had fallen out of the play-off positions as the season drew to a close. On 3 April 1999 during a home league match against Tranmere Rovers Watford manager Graham Taylor brought on Mooney as part of a triple substitution. The effect was almost immediate with Mooney whipping in a cross for Peter Kennedy to half volley home, as Watford went on to win 2–1. 
Taylor picked Mooney for the following week's away fixture against Birmingham City in his favoured striker's role. He scored the first and made the second in a 2–0 win. Watford went on to reach the play-offs gaining 19 points (out of a maximum 21) from their last seven games with Mooney scoring in every game bar one. He went on to give valuable performances in both legs of the subsequent play-off semi final (against Birmingham) and the final against Bolton Wanderers at Wembley Stadium, despite not scoring in either.
Watford's inaugural Premiership season started brightly enough for Mooney, who scored the only goal in front of The Kop at Anfield to secure a memorable away win against Liverpool. He then grabbed another the following week at home to Bradford City. He was injured in a 1–0 win against Gianluca Vialli's Chelsea in mid-September. He was only able to make eight appearances as Watford were relegated.
A return to the First Division in 2000 witnessed a fully fit Mooney back as centre forward. He became the first player in nearly a decade to score twenty league goals for the club. This achievement was enough to earn Mooney his second Player of the Season award.
In May 2006 Mooney became the fourth inductee into the Watford Hall of Fame, alongside Luther Blissett, John McClelland and Tony Coton.
Birmingham and beyond.
Out of contract with Watford, Mooney took up the offer of a better contract to play for Birmingham City, playing for the West Midlands club from June 2001 to July 2003 and making a total of 29 league starts. He featured heavily in the side that took Birmingham from the First Division to the FA Premier League via the playoffs in the 2001–2002 season. However Mooney played just one game in the top division before being loaned to Stoke City. At Stoke Mooney played 12 times scoring three goals one of which came against his former club Watford. Two other loans followed that season for Sheffield United and Derby County. At Sheffield United he scored once in the FA Cup, against future club Walsall.
Mooney then moved to Swindon Town for the 2003–2004 season. Mooney played a crucial part in Swindon reaching the play-offs that season, scoring 20 goals and setting up many more. Swindon lost in the play-off semi-final to Brighton & Hove Albion, with Mooney missing his kick in the penalty shootout when keeper Ben Roberts just tipped it around the post. Then in the summer of 2004, he transferred to Swindon's rivals Oxford United, having failed to agree a new contract with Swindon. He was Oxford's top scorer for the club in 2004–2005.
In the summer of 2005 Mooney signed for Wycombe Wanderers, on a two-year contract. His first season at Wycombe started superbly, scoring a volley against Carlisle United on his debut but ended in misery as he limped out of Wycombe's play-off semi final against Cheltenham, which Wycombe went on to lose. He was also captain of the side. Mooney also played in the biggest game of the latter part of his career when he played for Wycombe in the League Cup semi-final against Chelsea (both legs) including making the flick header to Jermaine Easter which resulted in a 1–1 draw in the first leg at Adams Park. Wycombe went on to lose the second leg 4–0 at Stamford Bridge
In July 2007 Mooney rejected a contract with Wycombe saying that they had not made enough changes to have a good chance of promotion the following season. He subsequently signed for newly promoted League One side Walsall.
Mooney's contract expired at the end of the 2007–08 season, and the player rejected the chance of an extension with the club. It was announced in June 2008 that Mooney had joined Segunda División B side UD Marbella. but has since retired.

Africando

Africando is a musical project formed in 1992 to unite New York-based salsa musicians with Senegalese vocalists. Musicians from other African countries were later included under the name Africando All Stars.
Salsa has been a hugely popular style in Central and West Africa since the 1940s-1950s, and the goal of Africando was to merge salsa rhythms from both sides of the Atlantic, mainly based on the African salsa tradition.
Africando was initiated by producer Ibrahim Sylla from Côte d'Ivoire and Malian arranger Boncana Maiga of Fania All Stars. Some of the musicians initially involved were: Ronnie Baro (of Orquesta Broadway) Pape Seck (ex member of Star Band), Nicholas Menheim (associate of Youssou N'Dour), and Medoune Diallo (formerly with Orchestre Baobab).
The first two albums were a big success in Africa and in the World Music scene. Singer Pape Seck died in 1995, and was replaced by Gnonnas Pedro from Benin (who died August 2005) and Ronnie Baró of Orquestra Broadway.
For the album "Mandali" (2000), well known African musicians, such as Tabu Ley Rochereau, Koffi Olomide, Salif Keita, Sekouba Bambino, Amadou Balaké and Thione Seck were invited. This new constallation led to the new name "Africando All Stars". Whilst in the beginning, the songs were Latin American classics sung in wolof language or a mix of wolof and Spanish, newer songs were African popular music classics, redone with Latin rhythms and instrumentation. With both approaches, Africando has been equally successful.
For the album "Martina" (2003) the group name reverted to the name Africando. The singers on this tribute to mothers, sisters, wives and girlfriends include Ismaël Lô from Senegal, and Nyboma and King Kester Emeneya performing Papa Wemba's song "La Référence".
Gnonnas Pedro's last recording is the title track of "Ketukuba" (2006) – he died before the CD was released. The same fate befell Alfredo Rodriguez who arranged 3 tracks on the album. With the emphasis on the links between Cuba and Africa, "Ketukuba" includes a Latinized version of Franco's "Mario", sung by Madilu System, and Joe King singing "Nina Nina", previously made famous by the Fania All Stars.
In 1998, the group covered Aïcha, primarily recorded by Khaled.

Raymond Green (1913–1949) was a pioneer in broadcasting. He was the CEO and Founder of WFLN Radio in Philadelphia and in 1946. He went on to be an announcer and manager at NBC
Born in Torrington, Connecticut, Green was named, in 1949, to be one of the most successful entrepreneurs of the 40's. While most radio stations had an AM station and then added an FM station, Green's Network was just the opposite. The FM station was issued their license on Tuesday, January 1, 1943. It went on the air two weeks later. Sign on was at 5 p.m. on February 22, 1943. Broadcasts in the early days were confined to evening hours and Transcription Broadcast Network was on the top three networks for three years strait.

Secure Flight

Secure Flight is an airline passenger pre-screening program, implemented from August 2009 by the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Secure Flight matches passenger information against watch lists maintained by the federal government. The initial implementation phase of Secure Flight resulted in the complete transfer of responsibility for passenger watch list matching to TSA from aircraft operators whose flights operate within the United States. The second phase of Secure Flight will result in the transfer of responsibility for passenger watch list matching to TSA for flights into, out of, and over the United States.
Secure Flight will serve to prevent individuals on the No Fly List from boarding an aircraft, as well as to subject individuals on the Selectee List to enhanced screening to determine if they are permitted to board an aircraft.
History.
The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004 requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assume from aircraft operators the function of conducting pre-flight comparisons of airline passenger information to federal government watch lists for international and domestic flights. The final report of the National Commission on the Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission Report) recommends that this watch list matching function “should be performed by TSA and it should utilize the larger set of watch lists maintained by the Federal Government” (See 9/11 Commission Report p. 393).
To fulfill this recommendation, TSA published the Secure Flight Final Rule on October 28, 2008. The Final Rule went into effect on December 29, 2008.
Benefits.
Currently, individual aircraft operators conduct watch list matching using lists provided by TSA. By assuming watch list matching responsibilities from the airlines, TSA will: 
Implementation.
Secure Flight began implementation with select domestic aircraft operators at the beginning of 2009 and completed implementation for all covered domestic and international airlines in December 2010. 
TSA's Office of Threat Assessment and Credentialing is the lead for the program. Contractors supporting the program have included IBM, Accenture, ESR, InfoZen, and Deloitte. Infoglide Software provided the underlying identity resolution technology.
TSA's met its goal to vet 100 percent of all domestic commercial flights by early 2010 and 100 percent of all international commercials flights by the end of 2010.
Privacy.
TSA has stated it will not collect or use commercial data to conduct Secure Flight watch list matching. It has also released a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). The TSA policy, however, makes no mention of any limitations on what the "airlines themselves", who collect the sensitive (birth date, etc.) information, may do with this.
Secure Flight has many similarities with CAPPS II and the No Fly List, and therefore raises the same validated concerns about civil liberties and due process. Specifically, civil libertarians argue that under the Secure Flight program, there are insufficient redress mechanisms for innocent citizens on watch lists. Additionally, the content and quantity of the watch lists has fallen under scrutiny.

1976 National League Championship Series

The 1976 National League Championship Series faced off the Cincinnati Reds (known for their nickname at the time, The Big Red Machine) and the Philadelphia Phillies. The Reds swept the best-of-five series in three games, winning easily in the first two games, and in their last at bat in Game 3. 
Stars of the series for the Reds included batters Johnny Bench (4 for 12, HR), Dave Concepción (4 runs scored), George Foster (2 H, both home runs), Ken Griffey (5 for 13, triple), Pete Rose (6 for 14, 2 RBIs, 3 runs scored), and pitchers Don Gullett (win, 8 IP, 2 hits), Pedro Borbón ( IP, 0.00 ERA), and Pat Zachry (win, 5 IP, 3 SO).
Game summaries.
Game 1.
Saturday, October 9, 1976 at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Reds starter Don Gullett held the Phils to two hits in eight strong innings and helped his own cause with an RBI single in the sixth and a two-run double in the eighth. George Foster added a solo homer.
Game 2.
Sunday, October 10, 1976 at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Buoyed by an RBI single by Bob Boone and a solo homer by Greg Luzinski, Phils starter Jim Lonborg no-hit the Reds until the sixth. After giving up an RBI single to Pete Rose, Lonborg was inexplicably removed from the game by manager Danny Ozark. Two more runs came across on an error by first baseman Dick Allen on a ball hit by Tony Pérez, and those would turn out to be the deciding runs as the Reds cruised to their second victory and an almost insurmountable 2–0 lead going back to Cincinnati.
Game 3.
Tuesday, October 12, 1976 at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio
Once again, the Phillies got a strong starting pitching performance that went for naught. Jim Kaat held the Reds to one hit after six innings. Meanwhile, his teammates provided him a 3–0 lead via a consecutive doubles in the fourth by Mike Schmidt and Greg Luzinski and RBI doubles by Garry Maddox and Schmidt in the seventh.
But, in the bottom of the seventh, Kaat began to lose it. Ken Griffey led off with a single, Joe Morgan walked, and Tony Pérez singled home Griffey. George Foster followed with a sacrifice fly. After a walk to Johnny Bench, Phillies reliever Ron Reed retired Dave Concepción, but then surrendered a two-run triple to César Gerónimo to put the Reds ahead 4–3.
The Reds then sent Rawly Eastwick in to close the game out in the eighth. The Phillies rallied against the closer as Jay Johnstone led off with a double and went to third on a wild pitch as Bob Boone walked. Larry Bowa doubled in Johnstone and Dave Cash hit a sacrifice fly to give the Phillies the lead back at 5–4. The Phillies added another run in the top of the ninth on an RBI triple by Johnstone to make it 6–4.
With Reed still on the mound for the ninth, Foster and Bench hit back-to-back solo homers to tie the game. Gene Garber relieved and promptly gave up a single to Concepción. Tom Underwood came on to surrender a walk to Geronimo. Pinch-hitter Ed Armbrister sacrificed the runners to second and third. Underwood then intentionally walked Pete Rose to load the bases. With the infield drawn in, Griffey hit a high bouncer toward Bobby Tolan playing first. Tolan charged, but the ball got past him and Concepción scored to send the Reds to their second straight World Series.

Castroverde

Castroverde is a municipality in Lugo province, Spain.
Castroverde is located in the mid-northeast of the autonomous community of Galicia.
Castroverde is very rural area. The main economic activity is milk and meat production. There are also a few rabbit and poultry farms. Rural tourism has some importance with a few rural hotels. Because farming is increasingly automated, Castroverde's population shrank during the 20th century, and prospects say that this process will continue until the present century.
Administrative subdivisions are called parishes; it has its origin in church organization. These 37 parishes are very rich in archeological vestiges, beautiful churches and chapels, waterwheels and "pazos" (beautiful houses of little nobility). Remains of an important Castle are also present in Castroverde.
Geography.
The territory is a transition zone between the plateau and the Sierras Eastern. The field is gaining height towards the east, Sierras de Moneiro, from O Mirador (with a height of 1034 meters in Pradairo), from A Baqueriza with a height of 836 meters and from Puñago. Numerous rivulets run down from these mountains. The rivers Guimaras, Azúmara, Romean, Outeiro and Tórdea are all tributaries of the Minho river.
The climate is oceanic with continental nuances. It has a temperature variation of up to 13 °C between low winter temperatures (5.6 °C in January) and mild summer (17.7 °C). Rainfall measures at about 1,000 millimeters.
Important historical events.
The king Silo of Asturias, who reign from 774 until 783, overturn a rebellion of Galician nobles in the parish of Montecubeiro, Castroverde.

Amygdalodon

Amygdalodon (; "almond tooth" for its almond shaped teeth) was a genus of herbivorous dinosaur with a long neck. The dinosaur itself is from the Bajocian stage of the Jurassic, and only a few bone fragments and teeth have been discovered. Very little is known about it, but it is one of the few Jurassic dinosaurs from South America found thus far.
"Amygdalodon" was 15 meters (50 feet) long, 4 meters (12 feet) tall. This quadrupedal dinosaur was very large, weighing as much as 24 tons. The type species, "Amygdalodon patagonicus", was described by Cabrera in Argentina in 1947.

Qfwfq

Qfwfq is the narrator of many stories appearing in several works by Italian author Italo Calvino.
Description of Character.
Qfwfq is as old as the universe and has taken various forms, of which Qfwfq retains its memory in later incarnations. For example, in the short story "Blood, Sea" (found in the collection "t zero") this character is a man riding in a car with three other people, but this man also remembers when he lived in the form of an amoeba of sorts inhabiting a primeval ocean. He also describes Zylphia, one of the other car passengers, as having been there, raising the question of whether Qfwfq is able to take multiple discrete physical forms at once. Qfwfq also describes having a family, who seem also to transcend time in a similar manner (for example, they had an uncle who was a fish while the rest of the family has evolved in amphibians). He also has a competitive relationship with a similar entity named Kgwgk, which results in the invention of art. In some stories he mentions other entities who are his friends or acquaintances and also has been going around for centuries in the Universe.
He is described as "not surprised by anything", and characteristically "not at all sentimental about being the last dinosaur".
Qfwfq's name.
The name "Qfwfq" (as well as "Kgwgk") is a palindrome. The name may be an allusion to the second law of thermodynamics; substituting "=" for "f" gives "Q=W=Q", which describes a heat engine.

Minnie Earl Sears

Minnie Earl Sears (17 November 1873 – 28 November 1933) formulated the Sears Subject Headings, a simplification of the Library of Congress Subject Headings. In 1999, "American Libraries" named her one of the "100 Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century".
Life and work.
Sears was a native of Lafayette, Indiana, and was awarded a B.Sc. from Purdue University at age 18, the youngest graduate in her class. She received an M.Sc in 1893. In 1900 the University of Illinois awarded to her a Bachelor of Library Science degree.
Sears had a long career as a cataloguer and bibliographer at a variety of libraries (Bryn Mawr College, University of Minnesota, New York Public Library), before she joined the publishing company H. W. Wilson Company in 1923 to publish her "List of Subject Headings for Small Libraries". The book provides a list of subject headings for small libraries to use in lieu of Library of Congress Subject Headings. Library of Congress headings are often not as useful for small libraries because they are too detailed. Sears’ "List of Subject Headings" also offers small libraries guidance on how to create their own new subject headings consistently when necessary.
In order to create her subject headings, Sears consulted small and medium sized libraries throughout the country to discern patterns of usage. She then developed her own system, based in part on the Library of Congress Subject Headings, but with a simplified subject vocabulary. In Sears’ system, common terms are much preferred over scientific and technical terms. Her system also allowed individual libraries the authority to create their own subject headings. The Sears model is not meant to serve as a standardized bridge for union catalogs, but rather as a model “for the creation of headings as needed”.
Like the Library of Congress Subject Headings, Sears' system is a subject list arranged in alphabetical order, making use of overarching subject categories and hierarchical subject subdivisions. However, Sears’ headings favor natural language. Her headings make use of only four types of headings: topical, form, geographic, and proper names. She also tended to convert inverted headings into direct entries.
In the third edition of the book (1933), Ms. Sears added a section called, “Practical Suggestions for the Beginner in Subject Heading Work”. These “Principles of the Sears List” were eventually published as a separate document and became a widely used teaching tool for library schools. In subsequent editions of the List, Sears’ subject headings were also linked to appropriate Dewey Decimal numbers.
In addition to creating the List, Sears edited the "Standard Catalog for Public Libraries" of the American Library Association, and an edition of the "Standard Catalog for High School Libraries". She eventually left H.W. Wilson to teach at Columbia University's School of Library Science, where she started the first graduate degree course in cataloging. Sears also remained an active participant in the American Library Association and the New York Library Association. "American Libraries" names one contribution she is best known for as co-editor of the Essay and General Literature Index from 1931-1933. After her death in 1933 at age 60, the book was eventually renamed in her honor to "The Sears List of Subject Headings". The List is currently in its 20th edition.

Holly Beach, Louisiana

Holly Beach (), also known as the "Cajun Riviera" (), is a coastal community in unincorporated community Cameron Parish, Louisiana, United States.
Known for crabbing and a drive on the beach, this small Southwest Louisiana community mainly consisted of beach-front cabins called "camps" which, due to the threat of hurricanes, were "built-to-be-rebuilt" by its residents. It is part of the Lake Charles metropolitan area, which has a population of 194,138.
History.
In September 2005 Hurricane Rita completely leveled the small beach town. Almost nothing was left but ruins and the water tower. This was the second time Holly Beach was devastated by a hurricane; in 1957 Hurricane Audrey smashed ashore with a 12 foot storm surge.
A year after the devastation of Hurricane Rita, Holly Beach was slowly coming back to life, with some residents living in mobile homes set up on-site. Many former residents believe the government officials are implementing such stringent building codes that it's now nearly impossible to rebuild. Many of these dwellings are parked under canopy type structures for shade. The new telephone poles are set up carrying electricity, but are lined up ominously in the familiar rows, revealing the numerous empty lots. The current residents must sign a waiver which allows them to dwell there, despite the lack of a functioning sewer system which is a concern to the state’s department of health.
It became common to see portable toilets on the community’s road sides, which are well maintained for the few locals and visitors alike. For new structures in Cameron Parish, the new building codes apply. In nearby Cameron, according to the parish officials, the coastal buildings built before the late 1980s that had less than fifty percent damage may retain the same pre-Rita elevation. It was estimated that some twenty-percent of these structures met the criteria and wouldn’t have to have an elevation increase. But just how stringent the new building codes in Cameron and the surrounding parish will be enforced will be determined by surveyors using Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood maps.
It was feared that these strict building codes, along with the high insurance costs, would keep many of the original locals from returning and rebuilding, and that the southern part of the parish would end up with temporary trailer type housing indefinitely. Within Holly Beach, there are several permanent structures being built, with pier elevations complying with building codes. These structures are a testament to those determined residents who will not give up their beachfront living to any force of nature, or any other opposition that is put between them and their "Cajun Riviera".
In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike reflooded the area.
Population prior to Rita: Approximately 300
Geography.
It is located 10 miles west of Cameron and 12 miles east of Johnson Bayou.
Culture.
In 1991, the town was immortalized as the subject of the nostalgic and humorous Swamp Pop song "(Holly Beach) Under the Boardwalk" by Kenny Tibbs (Kenny Thibodeaux) and The Jokers, released on Jin Records. In a close parody of the 1960s hit "Under the Boardwalk" by The Drifters, the lyrics explain that cajun vacationers ""ain't got no boardwalk, just got seeweed, but we always pass a real good time at Holly Beach.""

CS Salamis Glory

The C/S "Salamis Glory" (formerly "Anna Nery", "Danaos", "Constellation", "Morning Star", "Regency Spirit") was a cruise ship registered in Limassol, Cyprus. She cruised the Eastern Mediterranean visiting countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Greece and Egypt out of Limassol.
History.
This ship was built in 1962 for Companhia de Navegacao Costeira, and was originally called the "Anna Nery". The ship was damaged in a collision with a tanker, "Presidente Deodoro", in 1963. Between 1965 and 1968 the ship was used on the route between Rio de Janeiro and Santos. After that the "Anna Nery" was used on coastal services, transatlantic services and as a cruise ship during the summer.
Decline in the passenger liner business caused the sale of the ship to the Greek Mediterranean cruise company Hellenic Cruises in 1978. During refits and modifications, the "Anna Nery" was briefly renamed "Danaos" (1979) and then "Constellation" (1982), In 1987 the cruise company operating the ship went bankrupt and the "Constellation" went out of service for four years.
In 1992, the ship was again purchased by another Greek owner and again renamed, this time to "Morning Star". It was put into cruise service in the Pacific. It was eventually renamed "Regency Spirit", registered in the Bahamas and passed to the American company Regency Cruises where it served on the Mexican coast during the winter and the Mediterranean during the summer. In 1995, Regency Cruises filed for bankruptcy protection, and the "Regency Spirit" was seized in Nice. The ship was auctioned off to the Cypriot Salamis Cruises in 1996, and renamed the "Salamis Glory".
The ship was rebuilt in 2000.
On August 30, 2007, "Salamis Glory" was involved in a collision with the small cargo ship "Shelly" near the Israeli port of Haifa. As a result of the accident, the cargo ship sunk immediately and two crewmen died.
On December 7, 2009 it became known that "Salamis Glory" was sold on November 24 for 530,000 euros and headed to Alang, India, for scrapping. The ship was scrapped in Alang in 2010.
Ship description.
The "Salamis Glory" was equipped with a full restaurant, casino, two entertainment lounges, duty-free shop, mini-bar, swimming pool, and outdoor seating, including lounge chairs for relaxing. The ship had 222 cabins and eight passenger decks. The dimensions of the ship were long, wide and a gross tonnage of 10,392 GT.

System V Interface Definition

The System V Interface Definition (or SVID) is a standard that describes the AT&T UNIX System V behavior, including that of system calls, C libraries, available programs and devices. While it was not the first attempt at a standardizations document (the industry trade association /usr/group published a standard in 1984 based on System III with a few system call additions from BSD), it was an important effort of early standardization of UNIX in a period when UNIX variants were multiplying rapidly and portability was problematic at best. By 1986, AT&T required conformance with SVID issue 2 if vendors were to actually brand their products "System V R3". By the 1990s, however, its importance was largely eclipsed by POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification, which were based in part upon the SVID. Part of the reason for this was undoubtedly their vendor-independent approach (see Unix wars).

Juan Diego Flórez

Juan Diego Flórez Salom (born January 13, 1973) is a Peruvian operatic tenor, particularly known for his roles in bel canto operas. On June 4, 2007, he received his country's highest decoration, the "Gran Cruz de la Orden del Sol del Perú".
Biography.
Early years.
Juan Diego Flórez was born in Lima, Peru, on January 13, 1973 where his father, Rubén Flórez, was a noted guitarist and singer of Peruvian popular and "criolla" music. In an interview in the Peruvian newspaper "Ojo", Flórez recounted his early days when his mother managed a pub with live music and he worked as a replacement singer whenever the main attraction called in sick. "It was a tremendous experience for me, since most of those who were regulars at the pub were of a certain age, so I had to be ready to sing anything from huayños to Elvis Presley music and, in my mind, that served me a great deal because, in the final analysis, any music that is well structured—whether it is jazz, opera, or pop—is good music".
Initially intending to pursue a career in popular music, he entered the Conservatorio Nacional de Música in Lima at the age of 17. His classical voice emerged in the course of his studies there under Maestro Andrés Santa María. During this time, he became a member of the Coro Nacional of Peru and sang as a soloist in Mozart's "Coronation Mass" and Rossini's "Petite messe solennelle".
He received a scholarship to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia where he studied from 1993 to 1996 and began singing in student opera productions in the repertory that is still his specialty today, Rossini and the bel canto operas of Bellini and Donizetti. During this period, he also studied with Marilyn Horne at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. In 1994 the Peruvian tenor, Ernesto Palacio invited him to Italy to work on a recording of Vicente Martín y Soler's opera "Il Tutore Burlato". He subsequently became Flórez's teacher, mentor and manager and has had a profound influence on his career.
1996–present.
Flórez's first breakthrough, and professional debut came in 1996, at the Rossini Festival in the Italian city of Pesaro, Rossini's birthplace. At the age of 23, he stepped in to take the leading tenor role in "Matilde di Shabran" when Bruce Ford became ill. He made his debut at La Scala in the same year as the "Chevalier danois" (Danish Knight) in Gluck's "Armide", and later in the year he sang the role of Georges in Meyerbeer's "L'étoile du nord" with Wexford Festival Opera. His Covent Garden debut followed in 1997 where he sang the role of Count Potoski in a world premiere concert performance of Donizetti's "Elisabetta". Debuts followed at the Vienna State Opera in 1999 as Count Almaviva in "Il barbiere di Siviglia" and at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 2002, again as Count Almaviva. On February 20, 2007, the opening night of Donizetti's "La fille du régiment" at La Scala, Flórez broke the theater's 74-year-old tradition of no encores when he reprised "Ah! mes amis" with its nine high C's following an "overwhelming" ovation from the audience. He repeated this solo encore at New York's Metropolitan Opera House on April 21, 2008, the first singer to do so there since 1994.
Flórez is also active on the concert stages of Europe, North America, and South America. Amongst the many venues in which he has given concerts and recitals are the Wigmore Hall in London, the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York, the Palau de la Música in Barcelona, the Teatro Segura in Lima, and the Mozarteum in Salzburg. In a departure from his usual repertoire, he sang "You'll Never Walk Alone" from the Broadway musical "Carousel" at the Berlin Live 8 concert in 2005.
He was signed by Decca in 2001 and since then has released six solo recital CDs on the Decca label: "Rossini Arias", which won the 2003 Cannes Classical Award; "Una furtiva lagrima", which won the 2004 Cannes Classical Award; "Great Tenor Arias" which won the 2005 Echo Klassik award for the best arias and duets recital; "Sentimiento Latino"; "Arias for Rubini" and most recently, "Bel Canto Spectacular". His latest recording is Gluck's "Orphée et Eurydice", recorded live in May 2008.
In addition to his official discography, almost all his professionally performed roles have been preserved in radio broadcasts, and many also by television.
Voice.
Flórez has a leggero tenor voice that is audible in even the largest houses due to the predominance of high frequencies in its harmonic structure. Its compass is two octaves, up to and including the high E flat (Zelmira, 2009 in live performance, also on CD in an aria by Bellini—"All udir de padre afflitto"—in the CD "Arias for Rubini"), the higher part of its range being particularly strong and brilliant, with almost no sense of effort, while the lowest notes are comparatively weaker. The head and chest registers are perfectly integrated, with no audible break in the passaggio. His breath control is impeccable, allowing the longest phrases to be sustained with apparent ease. The ornaments of bel canto, including the trill, are well executed, and stylistic errors such as intrusive aspirates generally eschewed. Perhaps the most distinctive technical accomplishment is the singer's mastery of coloratura heard to best effect in his Idreno ("Semiramide") and Corradino ("Matilde di Shabran").
Awards and distinctions.
Juan Diego Flórez has been recognized by his native country with several awards and distinctions. In May 2004, he received the "Orden al Mérito Cultural de Lima", from the Mayor of Lima; the "Orden al Mérito por servicios distinguidos en el grado de Gran Cruz" from President Alejandro Toledo; and was named an Honorary Professor of San Martín de Porres University. On June 4, 2007, he received his country's highest honor, the "Gran Cruz de la Orden El Sol del Perú", from President Alan García.
He has been an Austrian Kammersanger since 2012.
Flórez also appeared on the 2-sol stamp, part of a series of five stamps honouring contemporary Peruvian musicians issued on November 29, 2004. It is highly unusual for a living opera singer to have been honoured in his home country this way, particularly one so young. (Flórez was 31 at the time). (The portrait of Flórez used on the stamp was by British photographer, Trevor Leighton, and was also used for the cover of his 2003 CD "Una Furtiva Lagrima".)
From the classical music world he has received the "Premio Abbiati 2000" (awarded by Italian critics for the best singer of the year); the "Rossini d'oro"; the "Bellini d'oro"; the "Premio Aureliano Pertile"; the "Tamagno Prize"; and the "L'Opera" award (Migliore Tenore) for his 2001 performance in "La sonnambula" at La Scala.
In 2009, Flórez was nominated for the Best Classical Vocal Performance in the 52nd Grammy Awards for his album, "Bel Canto Spectacular" (Decca).
Personal life.
Flórez married German-born Australian Julia Trappe in a private civil ceremony on April 23, 2007 in Vienna. They held a religious ceremony at the Basilica Cathedral in Lima on April 5, 2008, which some of Peru's leading citizens, including President Alan García and author Mario Vargas Llosa, attended. Flórez was present at the birth of his son, Leandro, who was born on April 9, 2011, less than an hour before Flórez took to the stage in "Le comte Ory", broadcast live around the world from the Met. A daughter, Lucia Stella, was born in the family home in Pesaro, Italy, on January 1, 2014.

Congress Avenue Historic District

Congress Avenue is a major thoroughfare in Austin, Texas. The street is a six-lane, tree lined avenue that cuts through the middle of the city from far south Austin and goes over Lady Bird Lake leading to the Texas State Capitol in the heart of Downtown.
Congress Avenue south of Lady Bird Lake is known as South Congress, often abbreviated to SoCo, and is an increasingly popular shopping and rental district. It passes the historic Travis Heights neighborhood, the Texas School for the Deaf, and St. Edward's University as it passes south out of town.
History.
Edwin Waller, the first mayor of Austin, designed Congress Avenue to be Austin's most prominent street. Early structures along Congress Avenue included government buildings, hotels, saloons, retail stores and restaurants. By the late 1840s "The Avenue" formed a well-established business district. The mid-1870s introduced gaslight illumination and mule-driven streetcars as well as construction of a new Travis County courthouse at Eleventh Street. The present Texas Capitol at the north end of Congress Avenue was built in 1888. The original dirt street was bricked in 1910. Trolley cars operated on the Avenue until 1940.
Before Interstate 35 was completed in the 1960s, Congress Avenue was the primary road to reach Austin from the south. Certain landmarks such as the Austin Motel identify the road as a major thoroughfare for travellers through the mid-20th century.
Route description.
Congress Avenue begins at an intersection with Slaughter Lane near Interstate 35. It heads to the north-northeast, diverging away from I-35. This portion of Congress from Slaughter Lane north to the Williamson Creek bridge is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation and carries the Loop 275 designation. After the intersection with Stassney Lane, the road heads to the northeast, now parallel to I-35. Congress Avenue passes over the U.S. Highway 290 freeway as it travels to the northeast. Continuing to the northeast, it passes by St. Edward's University before crossing over Lady Bird Lake (Colorado River) by way of the Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge. The street continues northeast through downtown Austin to 11th Street at the Texas State Capitol. At the Capitol, it splits into a one-way pair, with the northbound lanes going around the east side of the Capitol, and the southbound lanes going around the west side. The street merges back to a 2-way street northeast of the Capitol and continues heading to the northeast. It continues for several more blocks before coming to an end at the University of Texas at Austin campus at Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard.
Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge.
The Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge over Lady Bird Lake houses the world's largest urban bat population. When the bridge was refurbished in the 1980s, the new design created crevices underneath the structure that happened to be ideal for bats to roost in. In the summer, the colony has up to 1.5 million Mexican Free-tailed Bats. The bats can be seen emerging by the thousands from under the bridge every evening throughout the summer, before they migrate to Mexico for the winter.
Recognition.
In recognition of its architectural and historical significance, Congress Avenue from First Street to the Capitol was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

Gustav Brunner

Gustav Brunner (born 12 September 1950 in Graz, Austria) is an Austrian Formula One designer and engineer. He started his career in racing car design at the German-based constructor McNamara. He first entered F1 in a brief spell working for the ATS team in 1978, before designing cars for Formula Two and sportscar racing. He came to prominence in Formula One in 1983, by returning to ATS. He would design two chassis for the team, the 1983 D6 and the 1984 D7, before quitting after a number of arguments with team principal Hans Gunther Schmidt. 1985 would see him joining RAM Racing, designing the RAM 03 car. By now he was gaining a reputation within the sport for designing good chassis on a limited budget, even if the teams he had worked for had a conspicuous lack of results.
He then worked for Arrows and Ferrari, before reuniting with ATS boss Schmidt as designer for his new Rial F1 outfit in 1988. He fell out with Schmidt again and became Technical Director of the Zakspeed team. When the team folded at the end of the 1989 season, he moved on to Leyton House, staying as they reverted to March Engineering - during this period, he is perhaps best remembered for vaulting the pitlane wall and running on to the track when Ivan Capelli finished 2nd in the 1990 French Grand Prix. With March Engineering folding, he moved to Minardi for 1993, designing their successful M193 chassis, before another switch, to Ferrari's Research & Development department, eventually returning to Minardi as chief designer in 1997 to help new technical director, Gabriele Tredozi, and became the technical director in 1999.
Following three successive seasons where his Minardi designs had been praised for their innovative design considering such small resources, he was head-hunted by Toyota to become their Technical Director for their new Formula One team in 2001. He left Toyota at the end of 2005.

Alyas Batman en Robin

Alyas Batman en Robin is a 1991 Filipino Batman comedy film produced by Regal Films spoofing the 1960s "Batman television series". It later become popular on the Australian market and became used as a training film for The Birds are Coming Enterprises.
The movie was initially an unauthorized production, set to capitalize on the then in-production 1989 Batman film starring Michael Keaton. Warner Brothers threatened legal action and the release of the film was delayed until legal entanglements could be sorted out. The film was released in 1991, two years later than the intended 1989 release.
It stars comedian Joey de Leon as Batman, his son Keempee as Robin (the logo on his costume is actually the logo of rival film studio Regal Films instead of the robin logo) and Dawn Zulueta as Wonder Woman. Several villains are also featured such as the Joker and the Penguin (here "Chu-p-a-enguin", literally "Blowjob-guin" in Spanglish, as well as a pun on "Tiyo Paeng"), portrayed respectively by the late comedians Rene Requiestas and Panchito Alba; this would be the former's final movie before his death on July 24 of the same year.
A sequel was planned, launching Thursday group member and popular matinee teen idol and hearthrob Hector Chua. Unfortunately plans did not materialize.

Coronal suture

The coronal suture is a dense, fibrous connective tissue joint that separates the frontal and parietal bones of the skull. At birth, the bones of the skull do not meet. 
Pathology.
If certain bones of the skull grow too fast then "premature closure" of the sutures may occur. This can result in skull deformities. There are two possible deformities that can be caused by the premature closure of the coronal suture:

Henry Daniell

Henry Daniell (5 March 1894 – 31 October 1963) was an English actor, best known for his villainous film roles, but who had a long and prestigious career on stage as well as in films.
Daniell was given few opportunities to play a 'good guy', one of the few being the biopic "Song of Love" (1947) where he played the supporting part of Franz Liszt. Another such opportunity was his role as Sir Alfred Lloyd in "Voice of Terror".
Early life.
He was born in Barnes, London, and was educated at St Paul's School, and at Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk.
He made his first appearance on the stage in the provinces in 1913, and on the London stage at the Globe Theatre on 10 March 1914, walking on in the revival of Edward Knoblock's "Kismet". In 1914 he joined the 2nd Battalion of the Norfolk Regiment, but was invalided out the following year. Thereafter he appeared at the New Theatre in October 1915 as Police Officer Clancy in "Stop Thief!", and notably, from May 1916, at the prestigious Theatre Royal, Haymarket.
London and New York career.
In April 1921, he appeared at the Empire Theatre in New York City, as Prince Charles of Vaucluse in "Clair de Lune", and subsequently toured for the next three years, reappearing in London at the Garrick Theatre in August 1925 as Jack Race in "Cobra". He again went to New York for the first six months of 1929, appearing at the Morosco Theatre in January as Lord Ivor Cream in "Serena Blandish", returning in July to London where he played John Carlton in "Secrets" at the Comedy Theatre.
He again toured America in 1930–31, this time appearing on the Pacific Coast at Los Angeles as well as New York once more. He returned to London for another packed programme of stage performances, which he continued in Britain and the United States while also beginning his film career in 1929 with "The Awful Truth", with leading lady Ina Claire.
Other Broadway credits include; "The Woman on the Jury" (1923), "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray" (1924), "Heat Wave" (1931), "For Services Rendered" (1933), "Kind Lady" (1935), "Hedda Gabler" (1942), "Murder Without Crime" (1943), "Lovers and Friends" (1943–44), "The Winter's Tale" (1946), "Lady Windermere's Fan" (1946–47), "The First Mrs. Frazier" (1947), "That Lady" (1949–50), "The Cocktail Party" (1950–51), "My 3 Angels" (1953–54), "Lord Pengo" (1962–63).
Hollywood.
Daniell appeared as Professor Moriarty in the Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes film "The Woman in Green" (1945). He appeared in other films such as Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" (1940) (he played Garbitsch, a parody of Joseph Goebbels), and "The Body Snatcher" (1945, with Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi) – as well as two other films in the Sherlock Holmes/Basil Rathbone series: "The Voice of Terror" (1942) and "Sherlock Holmes in Washington" (1943) with fellow Moriarty George Zucco.
He played the sleazy Baron de Varville opposite Greta Garbo in "Camille" (1936). Another early triumph was his portrayal of Cecil in "The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex" (1939). He also played the treacherous Lord Wolfingham (no relation to Francis Walsingham) in "The Sea Hawk" (1940), fighting Errol Flynn in what is often considered one of the most spectacular sword fighting duels ever filmed. When Michael Curtiz cast him in this film, Henry Daniell initially refused because he couldn't fence. Curtiz accomplished the climactic duel through the use of shadows and over-shoulder shots, with a double fencing Flynn with ingenious inter-cutting of their faces.
Towards the end of World War II, he appeared in one of his most memorable film roles, as the cruel Henry Brocklehurst in "Jane Eyre" (1944), opposite Joan Fontaine who played Eyre. In the 1950s and 1960s, he did much television, and also appeared as the malevolent Dr. Emil Zurich in Edward L. Cahn's "The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake" (1959), and in an episode of "Maverick", "Pappy" opposite James Garner the same year. An absolute professional, he was always on the set when needed, and impatient when delays in filming took place. Much in demand for his dry, sardonic delivery, Daniell moved easily from big-budget films, such as (uncredited) "Mutiny on the Bounty" (1962), to television without difficulty. In 1957, Daniell appeared as King Charles II of England in the NBC anthology series "The Joseph Cotten Show" in the episode "The Trial of Colonel Blood", with Michael Wilding in the title role. In the same year he played second chair to Charles Laughton's lead counsel in "Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)".
His last role was a small uncredited appearance as the British Ambassador in the 1964 film "My Fair Lady" directed by his old friend George Cukor. The scene in which he appears takes place at the embassy ball. He is seen as Eliza arrives and when introduced to her shakes her hand and says "Miss Doolittle." Later, Daniell presents Eliza to the Queen of Transylvania with the one line, "Miss Doolittle, ma'am." In the commentary on the DVD, at the moment he appears on-screen in the role, it is mentioned that the day he shot the scene was "his last day on earth", as he died from a heart attack that very evening on the set of "My Fair Lady" on 31 October 1963 in Santa Monica, California.
Personal life.
He married Ann Knox, and in the years following World War II lived in Los Angeles, California.
He and Ann were involved in a Hollywood sex scandal in the late 1930s. Visiting author P. G. Wodehouse wrote to his stepdaughter Leonora about the couple:
Apparently they go down to Los Angeles and either (a) indulge in or (b) witness orgies – probably both … there’s something pleasantly domestic about a husband and wife sitting side by side with their eyes glued to peepholes, watching the baser elements whoop it up. And what I want to know is – where are these orgies? I feel I’ve been missing something.

Finland national basketball team

The Finnish national basketball team () represents Finland in international basketball. It will make its FIBA World Cup debut in the 2014 edition, having qualified as a Wild Card. It has played at 13 EuroBasket tournaments, its best finish being 6th in 1967 on home soil.
History.
Early years.
Finland first competed in the European championship in the third installment, at EuroBasket 1939. In the round-robin there, they lost to each of the other seven teams in sequence, finishing with a 70–541 overall point differential.
1950s.
Finland's next European competition was 12 years later, at EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. They split their four preliminary round games, finishing third place in the group at 2–2 to be eliminated from championship contention. They had success after that, winning all three of their classification round 1 games and both round 2 games to finish in 9th place of the 18 teams.
In 1952, by virtue of hosting the games in Helsinki, Finland played in the Olympic basketball for the first time. The team finished bottom of its first-round Group B with the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Mexico, losing all of its games and scoring 147-178.
Finland again competed at EuroBasket 1953 in Moscow. In the preliminary round, they finished with 1 win and 3 losses for 4th place of the 5 teams in the group. They fared significantly better in the first classification round, winning 3 and losing only 1 to finish in the middle of a three-way tie in the group. They lost both the 9–12 and 11/12 classification games, however, taking 12th place of 17 overall.
Finland had great difficulty in the preliminary round of EuroBasket 1955. They lost all three early games in Budapest, being relegated to the classification round. Once again, faced with weaker opponents, the Fins shone in the classification round, winning all four of the pool play games. They won their classification 9–12 match as well, but lost to France in the 9/10 final to finish 10th of 18 in the tournament.
In Sofia for EuroBasket 1957, the Finns finished third in their preliminary group after going 1–2. They moved to the 9–16 classification pool, winning five games there and losing only two to take 11th place overall in the tournament.
Modern era.
In EuroBasket 1995 in Greece, Finland finished 13th.
Finland qualified for EuroBasket 2011. The tournament berth was the first for Finland in 16 years. There they finished third out of six teams in EuroBasket 2011 Group C, defeating Bosnia and Herzegovina 92–64 and Montenegro 71–65. This allowed them to they qualify for EuroBasket 2011 Group F. In their first match they were easily defeated by Russia but afterwards they defeated Georgia, before losing to Slovenia in their final match of the tournament. Despite not making it to the best of 8 tournament, Finland ended up making it to their first ever FIBA World Championship as a Wild Card team alongside Greece, Turkey, and Brazil.

Culture in Boston

The culture of Boston, Massachusetts, shares many roots with greater New England, including a dialect of the Eastern New England accent popularly known as Boston English. The city has its own unique slang, which has existed for many years. Boston was, and is still, a major destination of Irish immigrants. Irish Americans are a major influence on Boston's politics and religious institutions and consequently on the rest of Massachusetts.
Many consider Boston a highly cultured city, perhaps as a result of its intellectual reputation. Mark Twain once wrote of it, "In New York they ask "how much money does he have?" In Philadelphia, they ask, "who were his parents?" In Boston they ask, "how much does he know?"" Much of Boston's culture originates at its universities.
Performing arts.
The Washington Street Theatre District, south of Boston Common, contains a number of ornate theatres, including the Boston Opera House, the Cutler Majestic Theatre and The Citi Performing Arts Center. The most prominent professional theater companies are located at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge and at the Huntington Theatre, but small companies and theaters are scattered throughout the city, including at the Boston Center for the Arts and the Calderwood Pavilion in Boston's South End. The Boston Ballet is a world-renowned classical dance company. Street performers can be found in and around Quincy Market near Faneuil Hall. Every summer, the Commonwealth Shakespeare Company offers open-air performances free to the public on the Boston Common.
Boston is also home to a wide array of music - from bands like Boston and Aerosmith - to the world-renowned Boston Symphony Orchestra, the famed Boston Pops, the Boston Symphony Chamber Players, the Boston Philharmonic, the Boston Chamber Music Society, Boston Lyric Opera Company, Boston Modern Orchestra Project, Opera Boston, the Celebrity Series of Boston and the Handel and Haydn Society (one of the oldest choral company in the US). Major venues include Jordan Hall, Symphony Hall, and the Berklee Performance Center, as well as venues at each of the colleges and universities. Several important music schools are located in Boston, including the New England Conservatory for classical and jazz music, the Boston Conservatory for classical music, dance, and musical theater, and the Berklee College of Music for jazz and a variety of contemporary music styles. Every two years, the city hosts the Boston Early Music Festival, an international gathering for people interested in historical music performance.
Pop music manager Maurice Starr launched the careers of popular 1980s boybands New Edition and New Kids on the Block, both of whom were based in Boston.
There are also countless lesser known local musicians, thanks to a thriving underground music scene. In contrast to what might be considered the more "refined" aspects of Boston's culture, the city is also one of the birthplaces of hardcore punk. Boston had one of the leading local ska-punk scenes in the ska revival of the mid-1990s with bands like The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Allstonians, and Skavoovie and the Epitones. The Dropkick Murphys punk rock group have had tie-ins to both Boston professional sports teams, particularly the Boston Red Sox and Boston Bruins, and to some movie dramas early in the 21st century.
Boston was also the center of a thriving and influential indie rock, college rock, post-punk and new wave scenes throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including bands like The Cars, Pixies, 'Til Tuesday, Throwing Muses, Mission of Burma, The Lemonheads, Human Sexual Response, Galaxie 500, Damon & Naomi, Helium, The Pernice Brothers and Swirlies. Bands formed and located in the western part of Massachusetts in the college towns of Amherst and Northampton also had a major impact on the Boston music scene: important bands from western Massachusetts include Sebadoh, Dinosaur Jr., Buffalo Tom, and many others.
Boston is also known for its Hip Hop scene. Many rappers such as, Guru of the legendary rap duo Gang Starr, Big Shug, ED O.G. & Da Bulldogs, Mr. Lif, The Perceptionists, Benzino, 7L & Esoteric, and Special Teamz made this city famous for its urban music.
Actress and Latin pop singer Sasha Sokol relocated to Boston after leaving Timbiriche in the mid-1980s. Sokol recorded her solo debut album while still residing in Boston, only to return to Mexico City in order to do television work. Sasha remains the only Latin pop act to have been based in Boston.
Current music venues support a diverse array of live music throughout Boston. Venues support local bands, and showcase national touring acts. Clubs include The Middle East, T.T. the Bears, P.A.'s Lounge, Great Scott, and The Paradise (a larger venue). This scene is supported by local press including "The Boston Phoenix" and the "Weekly Dig", musicians from local colleges including the Berklee School of Music, and more recently Boston-based weblogs and podcasts such as Band in Boston Podcast.
Visual arts.
Museums dedicated to visual art in the Boston area include the Museum of Fine Arts, the National Center of Afro-American Artists, the Institute of Contemporary Art and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Notable art museums and galleries are associated with Harvard University, Boston University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston College, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Wellesley College, MassArt, and other schools.
Numerous art galleries are located on Newbury Street, in the South End and in the Fort Point Channel area. Some of the most influential and longest running galleries in these areas include the Bernard Toale Gallery, Barbara Gallery, Howard Yezerski Gallery. The Boston Sculptors Gallery is one of only a handful of cooperative sculpture galleries in the country. The Boston Art Dealers Association sponsors artist talks, panels and awards ceremonies on a seasonal basis.
The Boston Cyberarts Gallery (formerly Axiom Center for New and Experimental Media) is one of several venues showing cutting-edge "high tech" and experimental artworks. The Boston Cyberarts Festival, a biennial area-wide celebration of the intersection of art and technology, ran from 1999 to 2011. The periodic Festival has been replaced by year-round programs, as described on their website.
In addition, the Boston Public Library (BPL) and the Boston Athenæum each have large collections of art, books, and research materials, and regularly host cultural events and exhibits. The BPL collects and exhibits drawings by living Boston artists, and the Athenæum hosts annual shows by member artists.
The Penny Arcade Expo, or PAX East convention is also held here every year in March. This event is known as one of the largest gatherings of gamers and exhibiting studios, next to other major events like the Game Developers Conference. Growing exponentially with each annual iteration, the expo is well known to many in the gaming industry, and continues to draw crowds every year to the Boston Convention Center.
Events.
Several major events occur annually in Boston. One of the best-known is the Boston Marathon, one of the oldest and most prestigious marathon races in the world. Taking place on the third Monday in April, the Marathon attracts professional runners from all over the world, and hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents gather to watch and cheer on the runners, who range from first-time participants to well-known athletes.
Boston was also the first major city to host the annual First Night festival, which occurs during New Year's Eve. It is a major arts and activity festival which attracts over 1.5 million people. Started in 1976, it has since been emulated in other cities worldwide. The Saint Patrick's Day Parade occurs in March and is popular with the city's large Irish population.
The Boston LBGT Pride parade and festival attracts approximately 400,000 participants each June. The Boston Globe Jazz and Blues Festival also takes place each June, and the Boston Early Music Festival takes place every odd-numbered year. During the summer, there are musical performances at the Bank of America Pavilion on the South Boston waterfront. Also during the summer is Harborfest, a week-long festival celebrating American independence. Independence Day itself (the Fourth of July) is celebrated on the Charles River Esplanade; sunbathers and a flotilla of boats move in during the day, followed by fireworks after dark accompanied by classical and patriotic music performed by the Boston Pops.
The Boston Film Festival is held annually in early September. Also, the weekend following Labor Day, the boutiques on Newbury Street close as over thirty art galleries spill out onto the street, providing access to their contents during Art Newbury Street.
Every year from June to September, celebrations honoring several Roman Catholic saints are held in the streets of Boston's North End. These celebrations, or feasts, include Italian foods, religious services, parades, festivities, games, and live music and entertainment. The largest celebration of the year is the in August.
Food.
Cuisine in Boston is similar to the rest of New England cuisine, in that it has a large emphasis on seafood and dairy products. Its best-known dishes are New England clam chowder, fish and chips (usually with cod or scrod), baked beans, lobsters, steamed clams, and fried clams.
Boston has many restaurants, including those serving various ethnic cuisines. Since the 1980s Boston has been undergoing an unexpected Renaissance in its culinary life, spearheaded by chefs of national stature such as Jasper White, Ming Tsai, and Todd English. Their respective restaurants, Summer Shack, Blue Ginger, and Olives have greatly enhanced foodie options in Boston. The influence of Julia Child, a long-time Cambridge resident and PBS TV star, lives on as well.
The Union Oyster House is the oldest operating restaurant in the United States. Their menu includes oysters on the half-shell served straight from an oyster bar, New England clam chowder, and other seafood dishes. Quincy Market, part of Faneuil Hall Marketplace, has a variety of restaurants and food shops. Nearby "Cheers" is a popular tourist dining spot.
Boston's Chinatown has a variety of Asian restaurants, bakeries, grocery stores, and medicinal herb and spice vendors. In addition to dim sum and other Chinese dining styles, there are Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean and Thai restaurants in the neighborhood.
The North End has a variety of Italian restaurants, pizzerias, and bakeries and is well-known as Boston's "Little Italy." A favorite spot bringing in tourists is Mike's Pastry, located on Hanover Street and is extremely popular for its cannolis. Newbury Street has many ethnic street cafes, while Copley Place houses a multitude of restaurants including a food court in Prudential Center, also the home of Legal Sea Foods, a New England institution that offers gourmet seafood dishes.
Boston has a tradition of holding a weekly open-air Farmers market known locally as Haymarket. Haymarket caters mainly to selling fresh fruit and vegetable produce, though meats can also be purchased in local establishments. In addition to so-called "winter farmers markets", other more seasonal farmer's markets are held in locations around Boston and its suburbs.
African American Culture.
African American Culture in Boston is very colorful. Blue Hill Avenue runs through Mattapan, Dorchester, and Roxbury. The three cities have a large community of African American people. The Avenue is home to many hair and nail salons, as well as Chinese, Caribbean, and soul food restaurants. There are numerous community centers, like the Mattahunt, in Mattapan. The Mattahunt is an elementary school with after-school and summer camp programs. There are numerous Boys and Girls clubs and YMCAs. At many of these community centers, kids can come to swim, play basketball, and have a safe haven. The Roxbury Center for the Performing Arts is located in Dorchester. This school has been open since the late 1960s. It teaches jazz, ballet, hip hop, tap, African, and modern dance. Franklin Park Zoo is located on Blue Hill Avenue in Dorchester.
Religion.
Boston has been a noted religious center from its earliest days. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross (1875) in the South End, while the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, with the Cathedral Church of St. Paul (1819) as its episcopal seat, serves just under 200 congregations. Unitarian Universalism has its headquarters on Beacon Hill, Boston. The Christian Scientists are headquartered in Back Bay at the Mother Church (1894).
The oldest church in Boston is King's Chapel, the city's first Anglican church, founded in 1686 and converted to Unitarianism in 1785. Other notable churches include Christ Church (better known as Old North Church, 1723), the oldest church building in the city, Trinity Church (1733), Park Street Church (1809), First Church in Boston (congregation founded 1630, building raised 1868), Old South Church (1874), Jubilee Christian Church and Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help on Mission Hill (1878).

Trusted Information Systems

Trusted Information Systems (TIS) was a computer security research and development company during the 1980s and 1990s, performing computer and communications (information) security research for organizations such as NSA, DARPA, ARL, AFRL, SPAWAR, and others.
TIS was founded in 1983 by NSA veteran Steve Walker, and at various times employed notable information security experts including David Elliott Bell, Martha Branstad, John Pescatore, Marv Schaefer, Steve Crocker, Marcus Ranum, Wei Xu, John Williams, Steve Lipner and Carl Ellison. TIS was headquartered in Glenwood, Maryland, in a surprisingly rural location; the company was started in Walker's garage on Shady Lane in Glenwood, MD. As the company grew, rather than move to Baltimore or the Washington D.C. suburbs, a small office building was constructed on land next to Walker's new home on Rt 97.
TIS projects included Trusted Xenix, the first commercially available B2 operating system; Trusted Mach, a research project that influenced DTOS and eventually SELinux; Domain and Type Enforcement (TE) which likewise influenced SELinux; the fwtk Firewall Toolkit (the first open source firewall software) in 1993, which evolved into the Gauntlet Firewall and IPSEC in 1994 , one of the first commercial firewall and VPN products; and a broad range of Internet Standards, including S/MIME, SNMP, DNS, DNSSEC, IPSEC, ISAKMP, IKE, and many others.
The first whitehouse.gov e-mail server was located at their headquarters.
TIS's operating system work directly affected BSD/OS, which the Gauntlet Firewall and IPSec was based on, as well as Linux, FreeBSD, HP UX, Sun OS, Darwin, and others.
The company went public in 1996
and soon afterwards attempted to acquire PGP Inc.; it was instead acquired in 1998 by Network Associates (NAI), which later became McAfee, who had already bought PGP Inc. in 1997. The security research organization became NAI Labs and the Gauntlet engineering and development organization was folded into Network Associates' engineering and development.
NAI Labs went through a couple of branding changes which complemented Network Associates' branding efforts. In 2001 the name was changed to Network Associates Laboratories to better match the corporate identity. Then, in 2002-2003, there was a major branding initiative by Network Associates culminating in selection of the flag brand, McAfee. As a result, the security research organization became McAfee Research.
In 2003, SPARTA, Inc., an employee-owned company, acquired the Network Security branch of McAfee Research.
In 2005, SPARTA acquired the remaining branches of McAfee Research, which were organized into the Security Research Division (SRD) of the Information Systems Security Operation (ISSO).
In 2008, Cobham, plc, a British aerospace company, acquired SPARTA. There have been no organizational changes to SRD or ISSO that affect the security research.
On a separate path, TIS's primary commercial product, the Gauntlet Firewall, was acquired in 1999 from McAfee by Secure Computing Corporation (SCC), that used to be one of TIS's major competitors, because at the time McAfee wasn't interested in being a firewall vendor.
The code base was integrated with Secure Computing's firewall product and branded Sidewinder Firewall, which then returned to McAfee when Secure Computing was acquired by them in 2008, and re-branded McAfee Enterprise Firewall. The end of this product line came in 2013, following McAfee's acquisition of another major firewall vendor, Finland-based Stonesoft. McAfee announced in October 2013 the intention to migrate their existing installed base of firewalls to Stonesoft's own Stonegate.

<doc id="2888425" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2888425" title="Lake Street (Minneapolis)">
Lake Street (Minneapolis)

Lake Street is a major east-west thoroughfare in Minneapolis, Minnesota which is located between 29th and 31st Streets in south Minneapolis. It was named such because it runs through the Chain of Lakes area on the west side of town and passes over a small channel linking Lake Calhoun and Lake of the Isles.
West of the city limits, Lake Street is coextensive with Minnetonka Boulevard running nearly a mile into St. Louis Park and then separates from Minnetonka Boulevard (which continues westward all the way through St. Louis Park) and runs diagonally southwestward. In the Uptown neighborhood, the road is one-way and paired with Lagoon Avenue one block to the north to improve traffic flow. The street runs eastward past Interstate 35W and State Highway 55 (Hiawatha Avenue) to the Mississippi River where it crosses the Lake Street-Marshall Bridge into St. Paul and becomes Marshall Avenue.
Demographics.
Lake Street has attracted immigrants over the course of its history, and was a major center for the early Scandinavian culture of the city. The headquarters for the Sons of Norway fraternal organization is one remnant of this, located along Lake Street in Uptown, a block west of its intersection with Hennepin Avenue. Today, Mexican culture dominates along much of the roadway, particularly near and east of Interstate 35W.
Boundaries and neighborhoods.
Lake Street has historically and, in the late 20th century, become the official boundary of several Minneapolis neighborhoods. From west to east these include: East Isles, East Calhoun, Lowry Hill East, CARAG, Whittier, Lyndale, Central, Phillips West, Midtown, Powderhorn Park, East Phillips, Corcoran and Longfellow.
West of Interstate 35W, Lake Street is considered trendy and upscale. Informal commercial districts begin at the Lake Calhoun area which marks the end of West Lake Street, followed by Uptown, and then by Lyn-Lake. These areas generally have high property values and fairly high density. In the early 20th century this was one of the busiest areas outside of downtown as the streetcars headed west to Lake Minnetonka. Today they are among the most popular entertainment and nightlife areas in South Minneapolis, and the site of rapid condominium development in recent years.
The section of Lake Street stretching from Interstate 35W to Hiawatha Avenue has been in the past known for crime, prostitution, and drugs, especially in the late 1980s and early '90s. The street marks the southern boundary of the Phillips neighborhood, which was plagued with violence during that time. However, there has been reinvestment in the corridor, as most of this section of the corridor was branded with the Midtown neighborhood name. East Lake Street continues to undergo massive refitting to help reduce crime, boost property values, and attract more shoppers. Improvements to the area brought concerns for the many immigrant business and property owners on the street who are being assessed for the new sidewalks and street paving. Nonpositive gentrification was also a concern. An example of renewed interest in the area is the refurbishment of the Midtown Exchange building at East Lake Street and Chicago Avenue South. Formerly one of the most notoriously crime-ridden intersections in the city, is now home to an Allina Hospitals and Clinics expansion that brought 1,500 new employees to the area; the Sheraton Minneapolis Midtown Hotel and the Midtown Global Market with a wide variety of shopping, dining, events and rental.
The METRO Blue Line light-rail corridor meets Lake Street at Hiawatha Avenue, and has been another reason for investment in the area. The station itself is one of the most expensive along the line because it had to be elevated above a busy intersection. Furthermore, the Lake Street station has become one of the most crime-ridden stops along the Blue Line. Beginning in August of 2012, police have increased patrols, added 24 new high definition cameras, and even added classical music in an effort to deter troublemakers. Lake Street has undergone a major upgrade, its first in half a century. Some have proposed adding light rail to Lake Street since it is a major bus corridor (streetcar service previously existed until the 1950s). Others have suggested adding a streetcar line either to Lake Street or to the Midtown Greenway about a block to the north, a former freight rail bed that has been converted into a pedestrian and bicycle path.
East of Hiawatha Avenue, Lake Street stretches through the Longfellow and Cooper neighborhoods. This section represents the last remnants of Scandinavian investment for which Longfellow is well known. Recent investment in eastern Minneapolis includes new development at the corner of West River Parkway and East Lake Street, anchoring the Lake Street-Marshall Bridge. This area is populated with middle-class homes and businesses, with property values rising as the street approaches the Mississippi River.
Automobile era effects.
During the auto era, Lake Street had the greatest number of gas stations and car dealerships in the city. In the mid-1970s, the construction of a K-Mart closed off Nicollet Avenue at Lake Street and combined two city blocks. Many traditional streetcar-era buildings were razed during the auto era and much of Lake Street contains 1960s-era auto-oriented businesses with parking lots. A Target store and Cub Foods grocery store at opposite corners of Minnehaha Avenue and Lake Street also caused controversy for the pros and cons of this investment and typical suburban configuration with wide parking lot instead of an urban adaptation. 
Talks have begun on a new reconfigured site that reopens Nicollet Avenue to Lake Street. Efforts to redevelop more multi-use and density have been successful. Public investment and private redevelopment has occurred throughout the Lake Street corridor with a new public library near Minnehaha Avenue and the new mixed-use anchor building, Midtown Exchange, previously mentioned.

<doc id="2888430" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2888430" title="General revelation">
General revelation

In theology, General revelation refers to a universal aspect of God, to knowledge about God and to spiritual matters, discovered through natural means, such as observation of nature (the physical universe), philosophy and reasoning, human conscience or providence or providential history. Evangelical theologians use the term to describe knowledge of God, which they believe, is plainly available to all mankind. These aspects of general revelation are believed to pertain to outward temporal events that are experienced within the world or this physical universe. 
Characteristics.
In the course of general revelation, it is believed that God does not use specific words, or specific actions, but more general or encompassing events that occur in creation, conscience, and history. This belief in general revelation claims to have its support from the scriptures of , , and . The idea is that general revelation is to show the works and existence of God in indirect ways. 
In the context of general revelation it is believed that:
General Revelation is understood as to the experience of life by a person, and is solely dependent on the ability of the person(s) to clearly comprehend any part of God's hand in external events or things. 
General revelation is in contrast with special revelation and direct revelation, the former refers to the knowledge of God and spiritual matters which can be discovered through supernatural means, such as scripture or miracles, and the latter refers to a direct communication from God to a person.

KLNZ

KLNZ (103.5 MHz at 62 kW ERP) is a regional Mexican-formatted radio station serving the Phoenix, Arizona area. The station is owned by Entravision Communications. KLNZ is licensed to the nearby suburb of Glendale and broadcasts programming from Entravision's California-based "Radio Tricolor" network. The station also broadcasts with digital HD Radio technology. Its studios are located in Phoenix near Sky Harbor Airport, and the transmitter is located west of Surprise.
History.
103.5 signed on the air in 1994 as KTWC ("Twice 103.5") with an eclectic oldies-based format with music ranging from the 1950s through the 1980s. In 1996, KTWC was purchased by MAC America Communications, owners of KESZ and KTVK Channel 3, and was changed to Smooth Jazz-formatted KOAZ ("The Oasis") competing with KYOT-FM.
In 1997, MAC America decided to sell half its interest in the station to Owens Broadcasting, owners of heritage Country KNIX-FM. The format was switched once again to country, targeting a younger audience and going by the name of KWCY ("Wild Country"). A huge marketing campaign coincided with the change, publicizing the return of popular morning hosts Tim & Willy, who were at KMLE for a few years before a brief stint in Chicago. Tim & Willy eventually became morning hosts at KNIX. Giving up on the frequency, KWCY was put up for sale in late 1998.
Z-Spanish Radio Networks bought the station in 1999, and placed its Sacramento-based "La Zeta" Regional Mexican format on 103.5. At the time, the station became KLNZ. Entravision merged with Z-Spanish a year later, and its Zeta-formatted stations became Radio Tricolor.

AASHO Road Test

The AASHO Road Test was a series of experiments carried out by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to determine how traffic contributed to the deterioration of highway pavements. Officially, the Road Test was "...to study the performance of pavement structures of known thickness under moving loads of known magnitude and frequency." This study, carried out in the late 1950s in Ottawa, Illinois, is frequently quoted as a primary source of experimental data when vehicle wear to highways is considered, for the purposes of road design, vehicle taxation and costing.
The road test consisted of six two-lane loops along the future alignment of Interstate 80. Each lane was subjected to repeated loading by a specific vehicle type and weight. The pavement structure within each loop was varied so that the interaction of vehicle loads and pavement structure could be investigated. "Satellite studies" were planned in other parts of the country so that climate and subgrade effects could be investigated, but were never carried out.
The results from the AASHO road test were used to develop a pavement design guide, first issued in 1961 as the "AASHO Interim Guide for the Design of Rigid and Flexible Pavements", with major updates issued in 1972 and 1993. The 1993 version is still in widespread use in the United States. A new guide, originally planned for release in 2002 but as yet still under development, would be the first AASHO pavement design guide not primarily based on the results of the AASHO road test.
The AASHO road test introduced many concepts in pavement engineering, including the load equivalency factor. Unsurprisingly, the heavier vehicles reduced the serviceability in a much shorter time than light vehicles, and the oft-quoted figure, called the Generalized Fourth Power Law, that damage caused by vehicles is 'related to the 4th power of their axle weight,' is derived from this. The other direct result of the tests were new quality assurance standards for road construction in the US, which are still in use today.
The road test used large road user panels to establish the "Present Serviceability Rating" (PSR) for each test section, as the test proceeded. Since panel ratings are expensive, a substitute key parameter "Present Serviceability Index" (PSI) was established. The PSI is based on data on the roads longitudinal roughness, patch work, rutting and cracking. Later studies have shown that PSI is mainly a fruit of unevenness, with a correlation of more than 90% between the two. Unevenness was measured with a mechanical profilograph, reporting a parameter called slope variance (SV). SV is the second spatial derivative of height. For a vehicle traveling at speed, SV is the exciting source to vertical acceleration; the second derivative in time domain of height. This makes very good sense, since 1 – 80 Hz acceleration is the parameter used when relating human exposure from vibration to perceived discomfort in the current ISO 2631-1 (1997) standard. Thus, SV is physically linked to ride quality.
While the study is now quite old, it is still frequently referenced, though critics point out that its data is only valid under the specific conditions of the test with regard to the time, place, environment, and material properties present during the test. Extrapolating the data to different situations has been 'problematic'. Other studies have attempted to refine the results, either through further empirical studies, or by developing mathematical models, with varying success. The AASHO study is still the most often quoted study on the subject however.

Geomyoidea

Geomyoidea is a superfamily of rodent that contains the pocket gophers (Geomyidae), the kangaroo rats and mice (Heteromyidae), and their fossil relatives. 
Characteristics.
Although dissimilar in overall appearance, gophers have been united with kangaroo rats into a common superfamily for a considerable period of time. The superfamily Geomyoidea is among the few superfamilial relationships in rodents that is not subject to much controversy. Overall morphology, the fossil record, molecular analyses, and biogeography all support this relationship.
Geomyoids are most noticeably characterized by the position of the infraorbital canal. Unlike all other rodents who have the opening of the infraorbital canal facing forward, geomyoids have an infraorbital canal that faces to the side. Instead of passing through the zygoma, the infraorbital canal of geomyoids has moved to the side of the snout. This condition is so pronounced and the snout so narrow in heteromyids that the infraorbital canals from either side connect. Essentially, if the skull of a heteromyid is viewed from the side, the viewer can see directly through it.
Modern geomyoids are mostly restricted to North America, but some representatives have extended their range into South America since the Great American Interchange. Fossil taxa are known from throughout Laurasia.
Relation to other rodents.
Geomyoids have been considered to be either sciuromorphous or myomorphous depending on the authority. The masseter muscle does not pass through the infraorbital canal; it cannot due to the position of the canal. Some authorities consider the geomyoids related to squirrels, beavers, and mountain beavers on this basis.
The masseter muscle does attach directly behind the zygomatic arch in a manner very different from sciuromorphs. Some authorities consider geomyoids myomorphs based on this feature. This suggests they may be related to mice, jerboas, and perhaps dormice.
Taxonomy.
The family †Eomyidae is alternatively referred to as a member of the superfamily Geomyoidea or as a separate superfamily (†Eomyoidea) within the shared infraorder Geomorpha. †Florentiamyidae and †Heliscomyidae are usually placed within the superfamily Geomyoidea regardless of if eomyids are treated as a separate superfamily or not (Korth et al., 1991). McKenna and Bell (1997) do not recognize heliscomyids as a distinct family, placing the one or two heliscomyid genera in Geomyoidea "incertae sedis". Sometimes the pocket gophers and heteromyids are placed as separate subfamilies within a single family (Geomyidae). These subfamilies are Geomyinae and Heteromyinae respectively.

<doc id="2888449" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2888449" title="Special revelation">
Special revelation

Special revelation is a theological term used mainly by evangelical scientists and Christian theologians which refers to the belief that knowledge of God and of spiritual matters can be discovered through supernatural means, such as miracles or the scriptures, a disclosure of God's truth through means other than through man's reason. The distinction between Special and General revelation was first elucidated in-depth by the Catholic systematic theologian St. Thomas Aquinas in his discussion of Revelation. This distinction was only then more widely disseminated by evangelical writers who emphasized its scriptural support (e.g. Psalm 19).
Evangelical theologians use the term "special revelation" for the belief in God's intervention to make God's will and knowledge available that would not otherwise be available through general revelation. They believe that disclosure of this "special revelation" is at specific times to specific persons, and believed by Christian Theologians, to have been generally given through scripture, miracles, and through the person and ministry of Jesus Christ.
Other means by which God reputedly gave special revelation were by "divine voice or writing", "angels", "prophets", "visions" "dreams", "divine dictation", "inspiration" and "Spirit's guidance or guidance from the Holy Ghost". When reviewing these examples, one can see that they refer to direct revelation, which is now the third type of revelation, as a distinction between special revelation by way of "self-disclosure through the Bible" and personal communication from God.
Special revelation is a contrast to general revelation, which refers to the knowledge of God and spiritual matters which reputedly can be discovered through natural means, such as observation of nature, philosophy and reasoning, conscience or providence. 
The purpose of Special Revelation is to impart the knowledge and understanding of Jesus Christ, salvation and the atonement. Essentially it is knowledge and understanding, "that is requisite to salvation, that is, an explicit knowledge of Christ and his gospel."
The forms of special revelation as considered by mainstream Christianity are

Flying mouse

The flying mice, also known as the pygmy scaly-tails, pygmy scaly-tailed flying squirrels, or pygmy anomalures are not mice, not squirrels, and are not capable of true flight. These unusual rodents are essentially miniaturized versions of anomalures and are part of the same sub-Saharan African radiation of gliding mammal.
Characteristics.
These animals resemble mice with gliding membranes and long, sparsely-haired tails. Their appearance is similar to some marsupial gliders. They are less than 10 cm (4 inches) in head and body length and weigh 14-35 grams (1/2 - 1.2 oz).
Flying mice are nocturnal and are found in the poorly explored tropical forests of central (and to a lesser extent western) Africa. Little is known of their habits as a result. It has been suggested that one or both species may live in colonies of dozens of individuals. Bats may also be found sharing these tree-hollow colonies.

Euan MacLeod

Euan Macleod (born 1956) was born in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1956 and moved to Sydney, Australia in 1981, where he continues to live and work. He received a Certificate in Graphic Design from the Christchurch Technical Institute in 1975 and a Diploma in Fine Arts (Painting) from the University of Canterbury in 1979. Macleod deals mostly with landscapes and the human presence within it. The lone, anonymous figure is a common symbol in his work that embodies both the artists self portrait and the "Everyman" or universal experience of emptiness, worthlessness and impotence. He was been described as both an expressionist and a symbolist and his dense, textured and sculptural use of paint has become a consistent feature of his work. Macleod is not limited when it comes to the landscapes he paints, feeling equally at home in the picturesque New Zealand countryside and the harsh and flat Australian outback and often painting a hybrid of both landscapes. As well as pursuing his art he is currently also teaching painting at the National Art School in Sydney.
Exhibitions.
Throughout his prolific 30 plus year career Macleod has exhibited frequently. In 1980 he was involved in his first exhibition "Tar Paint Plastic" at the Settlement Gallery, Wellington with artists Debra Bustin and Alison Clouston, which was hailed as an "impressive debut" by reviewer Neil Rowe. Since then he has held over 100 solo shows and been involved in over 200 group shows. He exhibits most frequently with Niagara Galleries, Melbourne, Watters Gallery, Sydney and Bowen Galleries, Wellington. Macleod has also been involved in the Melbourne Art Fair since 2004 as well as the Auckland Art Fair since 2007.
Collections.
Macleod's work is featured in prominent public and private collections across Australia and overseas. In Australia he is included in the collections of the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia, Heide Museum of Modern Art and Art Gallery of Western Australia as well as numerous state, regional, university and private collections. Internationally Macleod's work is featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and numerous collections throughout New Zealand, including the Chartwell Collection, Saatchi & Saatchi, New Zealand and the Centre for Contemporary Art, Christchurch.

Devon Smith

Devon Sheldon Smith (born 21 October 1981 in Hermitage, Grenada) is a cricketer who represents the West Indies. His primary role within the team is as an opening or top order left-handed batsman, he has bowled right arm off breaks in his career but rarely at international level. In the West Indian domestic competitions he plays for the Windward Islands. He has been described as a compact player who heavily favours scoring on the offside.
Early domestic cricket.
He made his first-class debut in January 1999, opening the batting for the Windward Islands in a Regional Four Day Competition match, he made low scores of 12 and 4 in a heavy defeat to Barbados. His first half-century was brought up in his third match of the season, scoring 79 in the first innings against the Leeward Islands. It was the only time he passed 50 runs in his debut season, finishing with a batting average of 18.44 from nine innings, which is considered low for a specialist batsman. His average remained around that level over the following two seasons. Despite his relatively low scoring, he was picked to play for the West Indies A team against South Africa A in September 2000, making scores of 14 and 23 in a drawn match. In the 2000–01 season Smith was part of the Windward Islands team that won the List-A West Indian domestic competition for the second time in their history.
The 2001–02 marked a significant improvement in Smith's form, he made 841 first-class runs at an average of 64.69 and scored his first century. A successful tour of England with the West Indies A team followed, yielding 465 runs at an average of 46.50.
International cricket.
Smith made the step up to international cricket when he was selected in the West Indies squad to face Australia in their 2003 tour. He made his Test debut in the first match of a four-Test series at Bourda, a score of 3 in the first innings was followed by 62 in the second, in a match that Australia went on to win by 9 wickets. Despite scoring a pair in the second Test, Smith retained his place for the rest of the series, making another half-century in the third Test. Smith also made his ODI debut on the same tour, he played the first three matches of the seven-ODI series, making a highest score of 26.
After being dropped from the West Indies team for their 2003–04 tours of Zimbabwe and South Africa, Smith regained his place for England's tour following an impressive domestic season, where he was the leading batsman in the Regional Four Day Competition, scoring 842 runs at an average of 76.54. His good form continued into the first Test of the series, where he made 108, described as a "gritty effort laced with occasional panache", his first Test century. Smith was unable to play in the final two matches of the four-Test series after fracturing his thumb while practising in the nets. 
From May 2004 to June 2005 Smith played six Test matches, failing to reach a half-century in that time. During the 2004 tour of England he played three ODIs in the NatWest Series, where he made a highest score of 44, it was his last appearance for the ODI team until January 2007. Smith made a slight return to form in November 2005 against Australia in Brisbane. In a heavy defeat he was the only West Indies player to score a half century, making 88 in the first innings. Despite this Smith did not perform well in the rest of the series and again lost his place in the side.
Return to the side.
Smith made his return to international cricket in January 2007 for the West Indies's tour of India, he played in three matches of the four-ODI series, making a highest score of 33. He retained his place in the side for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, he didn't feature in the early stages of the tournament, but he played three matches in the Super Eight stage. He averaged 33.00 from his three innings, including a highest score of 61. Smith played no further part in the tournament as the West Indies were unable to advance to the semi-finals. In June 2007 Smith made his Twenty20 International debut, striking three sixes in an innings of 61. Later in the year he played both of the West Indies's two matches in the World Twenty20, making scores of 35 and 51. His return to the Test side also came in 2007, he played in all four Tests of the series in England. It was a disappointing series from Smith who averaged 21.28 with a highest score of 42. This was followed by an even worse ODI series in Zimbabwe, where in four innings he only managed a highest score of 5. An improvement came on the tour to South Africa, he hit three sixes in a career best ODI innings of 91.
After playing in the Test series against Sri Lanka and Australia, where he made a highest score of 48 from eight innings, he was dropped from the side for the tour to New Zealand. However, following a career best performance for the Windward Islands, scoring 212 runs against Guyana, he was rewarded with a recall to the side for the home series against England. He played in all five Tests of the series and finished with an average of 27.50 with a highest score of 55, his only half-century. He also played both matches of the following Test series, again against England. Although he failed to reach a half-century in his four innings, his average of 26.25 was the third highest for the West Indies. The second Test against England was the last Test Smith played in 2009, however he featured in the home ODI series against Bangladesh, where he made a highest score of 65. He was playing with an under-strength West Indies team because of the West Indies Players' Association strike. He played only one international match in 2010, scoring 55 in a drawn Test against Sri Lanka. Despite not playing in an ODI since September 2009, Smith was included in the West Indies squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He finished the tournament as the highest run-scorer for the West Indies; 300 runs at an average of 42.85 and a top score of 107, his first ODI century.
Following the World Cup, Smith was selected for the ODI and Test squads for Pakistan's tour. After disappointing Test and ODI series where, troubled by the spin bowling attack of Pakistan, Smith managed only 47 runs from five innings, he was dropped from the side.

PSpice

PSpice is a SPICE analog circuit and digital logic simulation program for Microsoft Windows. The name is an acronym for Personal SPICE - SPICE itself being an acronym for Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis.
History.
PSpice was initially developed by MicroSim and is used in electronic design automation. The company was bought by OrCAD, which was subsequently purchased by Cadence Design Systems.
PSpice was the first version of UC Berkeley SPICE available on a PC, having been released in January 1984 to run on the original IBM PC. This initial version ran from two 360 KB floppy disks and later included a waveform viewer and analyser program called Probe. Subsequent versions improved on performance and moved to DEC/VAX minicomputers, Sun workstations, Apple Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows.
Version 3.06 was released in 1988, also came on two 5.25 floppy discs, and had a "Student Version" available which would allow a maximum of up to ten transistors to be inserted.
Features.
During its development, PSpice has evolved into an analog mixed signal simulator. The software, now developed towards more complex industry requirements, is integrated in the complete systems design flow in OrCAD and Cadence Allegro. It includes features such as analysis of a circuit with automatic optimization, encryption, a model editor, support for parametrized models, auto-convergence and checkpoint restart, several internal solvers, a magnetic part editor, and support for Tabrizi core model for non-linear cores.
Introduction.
SPICE (Simulated Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is a general purpose software that
simulates different circuits and can perform various analysis of electrical and electronic circuits including time domain response, small signal frequency response, total power dissipation, determination of nodal voltages and branch current in a circuit, transient analysis, determination of operating point of transistors, determinations of transfer functions etc. This software is designed in such a way so that it can simulate different circuit operations involving transistors, operational amplifiers (op – amp) etc. and contains models for circuit elements (passive as well as active).
SPICE was first developed in the University of California, Berkeley, USA in early
1970s. Subsequently an improved version SPICE 2 was available in the mid of 1970s especially to support computer aided designs. In due course of time this program (SPICE 2 has become so versatile in the industry that people used to call, this program itself as SPICE. PSpice is also the member of SPICE family and it is a commercial software product based on SPICE algorithm. It is useful for simulating all types of circuits in a variety of applications. In both SPICE and PSpice, the circuit is described by statements those are stored in a file (namely Circuit File). The SPICE simulator is assigned to read this file to run the simulation. In PSpice, the statements are self – contained and independent; obviously they do not interact with each other. The statements are also easy to learn and use. PSpice includes additional features that make the program more flexible and user friendly. Notably among other features is the graphics post processor probe which acts like a software oscilloscope and is capable of exhibiting various waveforms. PSpice has become one of the most popular circuit simulation programs. In order to draw the circuit and create a schematic file, schematic editor can be used in the PSpice simulation.
PSpice is a part of larger software package called the Design Lab, originally developed by MicroSim Corporation as the Design Centre. It is now marketed by Or CAD.
Types of Spice.
The program SPICE 2 is of two types – mainframe version and personal computer (PC) version. Though the method of computation may differ between the two but their features are almost identical. The main – frame versions includes:
The PC versions are:
An analyst who is familiar with PSpice should be able to work with other versions.
Basics.
In PSpice, the circuit is first described to a computer by using a file called circuit file. It contains the circuit details, viz., the information about source and commands for what to do and what to display as output. The PSpice accepts circuit file as an input and after executing commands, creates an output file to store results. However, the circuit to be analyzed is specified in terms of element names, element values different sources (voltage or current) and different parameters. PSpice calculates all nodal voltages and branch currents over a range of time interval by giving the output of their instantaneous values. It can also perform other operations as will be evident later. For circuits with variable frequency sources, AC analysis is used. Each circuit element is connected between two nodes. All nodes must be connected to at least two elements and therefore appear twice at least. The node O is predefined as ground.
PSpice is a computer program itself so one need not have to do “programming” to use this software. The job is just to prepare the circuit file that instructs SPICE what to do. The circuit file consists of statements describing the circuit, specifying the analysis to be performed and statements to control the output formats and variables. PSpice is to do the simulation called for in the circuit file and stores the result in an output file. The results may be displayed and or printed.
Types of analysis.
The type of simulation performed by PSpice depends on the source specifications and control statements. The types of analysis usually executed in the PSpice program are as follows:
Operating temperature.
The operating temperature of an analysis can be set to any desired value by the .TEMP command. The nodal parameters are assumed to be measured at a nominal temperature which, by default is 27°C. This is not very significant in electrical circuit analysis.
SYMBOLS FOR TWO TERMINAL ELEMENTS:-
Table (1) provides the symbols used in PSpice for representing 2 – terminal elements.
The .OP command controls the output of the bias point but the method of bias analysis. If the .OP command is omitted, PSpice prints only a list of node voltages. If the .OP command is presents then PSpice prints all the currents from the voltage source – along with power dissipation. .TF command calculates the parameters of Thevenin’s (or Norton’s) equivalent circuit for the circuit profile. It is used to find out small signal DC gain, the input resistance, the output resistance of a circuit.
Limitations.
PSpice has the following limitations:
PSpice circuit description.
The circuit file is the input file to SPICE or PSPice program, which, following execution of the commands, provides the results in another file called the output file. The circuit file describes the circuit to the computer and is normally typed through a keyboard. The circuit file contains the details of components and elements, the information about sources, the commands for the determination of the objective and the desirable results to be provided by the computer at the end. In circuit file, the user is to assign the node numbers while the nodes connect the circuit elements. From the description of circuits, PSpice develops the mathematical tool to solve for the network.
The description and analysis of the circuit require the specification of the following:-
Designation of element values.
Two types of suffixes are generally used in order to write element values viz., scale suffix and unit suffix. Scale suffixes are upper letters and multiplies the number that it follows. Some of the unit suffixes and scale suffixes normally used are as follows:-
MEG = 1E6
M = 1E-3
N = 1E-9
P = 1E-12
K = 1E3
Each element in a PSpice circuit must contain a device name (such as Vs, Is, R, etc.) with an appropriate key initial letter. Upper or lower case letter can be used because PSpice is insensitive to case in circuit files. However, PSpice does not allow subscripts or superscripts. Is is thus written as IS, Vs as VS and so on. PSpice automatically assigns the corresponding SI unit for each element based on the key letter of its name, so units need not be written after element values. The element values are written in standard floating point notation with unit suffixes. Suppose we want to express the value of an inductor (20 mH). We will write 20 MH. Note that M means ‘milli’ and not ‘mega’. Mega is written as MEG. If we wish to write 10 mega ohms, we will write 10 MEGOHM.
Designation of nodes.
The location of an element is identified by the node numbers since each element is connected between two nodes. PSpice works fundamentally with node voltages, and the circuit description requires node numbers. All nodes must be connected to at least two elements and hence appear twice. Node numbers are integers but need not be sequential in PSpice. Node O is the ground node and all nodes must have a dc path to the ground node. Node voltages are identified by node number. The voltage difference between two nodes may be written as v (node 1, node 2), which stands for v(Node 1) – v(Node 2). If two or more connection points are joined by a zero resistance path, then that combination is treated as a single node. Each element in a .PSpice circuit must connect to nodes that specify the element’s location. Consequently, even a series connection point requires identifiers and can be treated as a node. The reference polarity for node voltage is always positive relative to the node O. PSpice employs the passive combination of all elements, with the first named node taken to be at higher potential.
Designation of circuit elements.
Circuit elements are designated by names and the name must start by a letter symbol. After the letter symbol it can contain either letter or numbers up to a total of eight characters. A passive element is described as follows:-
PSpice employs passive convention of elements, the first named node is taken as higher potential. The reference direction of current through the element goes from the first named node to the second i.e., the positive current flows from the first named node (N+) to the second (N-). I f the nodes are interchanged, the direction of the current through the element will be reversed.
Circuit files.
The circuit files contain five types of statements, some of which are optional. The statement types are:
It may be noted that for the SPICE/Pspice program, the first line being the title line, it may contain any type of text. The last line being the .END statement, the order of lines in between is irrelevant and does not affect the results of simulation. If any Pspice statement is more than one line, the statement can continue to the next line having a +sign in the first column of the next line. A comment line can be included anywhere proceeded by an (*). Upper or lower case letters may be used for Pspice statements (upper case for SPICE 2). Number of blanks between items is insignificant except in the title line.
Device statements.
It includes a user supplied name, the numbers of the nodes to which the element is connected and the element is connected and the element’s value. Independent dc voltage and current sources are described by the following scheme; the required key letter (V or I) are capitalised and is followed by the higher and lower potential node numbers (N+ and N-) respectively. The value is then given and may be +ve or –ve. Except sources, zero values are not allowed. Infinite value of any element is not feasible.
 Numerical values are expressed in either floating point or fixed point form. The floating point notation for R*10β is Rep when R is any number and p is a positive or negative number. Alternatively, a number may be followed immediately by any scale factor. Numerical values in device statements may also be specified via expression. The form of statement then includes (expression) where the early brackets enclose a mathematical relation. The mathematical operators are symbolised by:-
 + (addition) -(subtraction)
 *(multiplication) /(division).
Control statements.
Here the only essential one required is the last line i.e., the end statement. Pspice produces its default output consisting of:
The optional control statement affects the output format and written in form of
When ‘list’ gives a summary of elements, ‘node’ gives a summary of connection while “no page” suppresses paging. It is usual to include .option no page to conserve paper.
PSpice output.
If the Pspice default output does not provide enough information, the circuit file should be augmented to give values of other variables desired. If only the branch current is desired, the default output automatically includes the currents through all independent voltage sources. Accordingly, it is required to incorporate a current – scaling zero voltage source in the appropriate branch. This source has O voltage magnitude and acts like a short. It does not alter the circuits’ behaviour but it requires an additional node number. It is basically a dc dummy voltage source (0V) added to the specify branch and used as an ammeter to measure the current of the source.
 To get several branch currents and or voltages, it is possible to use a print control statement having the general form
Where VAR1, VAR2……… represent all the variables of interest. The default output is not supplied when the ckt file includes a .PRINT DC statement. The .PRINT DC statement should also be accompanied by a source control statement governing the value of an independent voltage or current source.
Pspice has capability for printing and plotting of output voltages or currents. For dc sweep and transient analysis, the output voltages and currents can be obtained by the following statements:-
PSpice usually does not allow measuring voltage across a passive element like V(R1), V(C1), V(L1) except when used only for outputs by .PLOT and .PRINT statement.
The commands those are available in PSpice simulation to get the output are as follows:-
(Probe is the graphics waveform analyser and is available in the professional version of PSpice. Once the results of the simulations are processed by .PROBE command, the results are available for graphic displays).

Pioneer P-1

Pioneer P-1 was a failed mission in the Pioneer program. The spacecraft was a 1 meter diameter sphere, with a propulsion module. It was launched on September 24, 1959 on an Atlas C-Able launcher. It was to carry a TV camera and a magnetic field sensor. It was to be spin-stabilized, and was known as a 'paddlewheel' spacecraft. The Atlas-Able launch vehicle was destroyed in an explosion on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral during a pre-launch static test. The payload of P-1 spacecraft and Able IV space engine was not present on the launch vehicle when it exploded.

The Allogromiida comprise an order of single-chambered, mostly organic-walled foraminiferans, including some that produce agglutinated tests (Lagynacea). Genetic studies indicate that some foraminiferans with agglutinated tests, previously included in the Textulariida or as their own order Astrorhizida, may also belong here. Allogromiids produce relatively simple tests, usually with a single chamber, similar to those of other protists such as "Gromia". They are found as both marine and freshwater forms, and are the oldest forams known from the fossil record.

Foam rubber

Foam rubber (also known as cellular, sponge, or expanded rubber) 
Manufacturing history.
Foam rubber was first produced in 1929 by Dunlop researcher E. A. Murphy using whipped latex. In 1937 isocyanate based materials were first used for the formation of foam rubbers, after World War II styrene-butadiene rubber replaced many natural types of foam. Foam rubbers have been used commercially for a wide range of applications since around the 1940s. Currently polyurethane based foams make up over 90%, by weight, of the entire market for polyurethanes. Transportation, construction, home furniture, noise reduction/vibration and carpet are the largest users of polyurethane, with construction at 27% and transportation at 21% respectively. Flexible foam is that leading material usage at 44% total volume, and rigid foam material at 28% of the United States market.
Manufacturing process.
Rates of polymerization can range from many minutes to just a few seconds. Fast reacting polymers feature short cycle periods and require the use of machinery to thoroughly mix the reacting agents. Slow polymers may be mixed by hand, but require long periods on mixing, as a result industrial application tends to use machinery to mix products. Product processing can range from a variety of techniques including, but not limited to spraying, open pouring, and molding.
Material preparation Liquid and solid material generally arrive on location via rail of truck, once unloaded liquid materials are stored in heated tanks. When producing slabstock typically two or more polymers streams are used.
Mixing Open pouring, better known as continuous dispensing is used primarily in the formation of rigid, low density foams. Specific amounts of chemicals are mixed into a mixing head, much like an industrial blender. The foam is poured onto a conveyor belt, where it then cures for cutting.
Curing and Cutting After curing on the conveyor belt the foam is then forced through a horizontal band saw. This band saw cuts the pieces in a set size for the application. General contracting uses 4’x12’x2’’.
Further processing Once cut and cured the slabstock can either be sold or a lamination process can be applied. This process turns the slabstock into a rigid foam board known as boardstock. Boardstock is used for metal roof insulation, oven insulation, and many other durable goods.
Physical properties.
The main physical properties of foam rubber are generalized as being “Lightweight, buoyant, cushioning performance, thermal and acoustic insulation, impact dampening and cost reduction”. Crosslinking technology is used in the formation of EVA based foams, including LLDPE,LDPE,HDPE,PP, and TPE. Crosslinking is the most important characteristic in the production of foam rubber to obtain the best possible foam expansion and physical properties. Crosslinking is defined as chemical bonding between polymer chains, and is used for foam rubber manufacturing to stabilize bubble expansion, enhanced resistance to thermal collapse and improve physical properties.
Recycling.
Due to the variety in polyurethane chemistries, it is difficult to recycle foam materials using a single method. Reusing slab stock foams for carpet backing is how the majority of recycling is done. This method involves shredding the scrap and bonding the small flakes together to form sheets. Other methods involve breaking the foam down into granules and dispersing them into a polyol blend to be molded into the same part as the original. The recycling process is still ever developing for foam rubber and the future will hopefully unveil new and easier ways for recycling.

Tree squirrel

Tree squirrels include over a hundred species that are found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia (aside from a small introduced population of five-lined palm squirrels near Perth), and are the members of the squirrel family (Sciuridae) most commonly referred to as "squirrels". They do not form a single natural, or monophyletic, group, but instead are related to the various other animals in the squirrel family, including ground squirrels, flying squirrels, marmots, and chipmunks. The defining characteristic that is used to determine which of the various species of Sciuridae are tree squirrels is therefore not so dependent on their physiology, but their habitat. Tree squirrels live mostly among trees, as opposed to other squirrels that live in burrows in the ground or among rocks. However, there is one exception to this rule, as physiological distinction does make a difference in regard to flying squirrels, who also make their home in trees, but have unique physical characteristics that separate them from their tree squirrel cousins (specifically, special flaps of skin that act as glider wings, allowing them to "fly").
The most well known genus of tree squirrels is "Sciurus", which includes the Eastern gray squirrel of North America (and which was introduced in 1876 to Great Britain), the red squirrel of Eurasia, and the North American fox squirrel, among many others. Since many tree squirrel species have readily adapted to human-altered environments (including intensely cultivated farms and urban cities), and because they are mostly diurnal (active during the daytime), when most people are outdoors to see them, they are perhaps the most familiar members of the rodent family to most humans. In some larger cities, they are often the only wild animals (not counting birds) that most people ever see.
Classification.
Guy G. Musser, one of the world's leading experts on rodents, and the Archbold Curator Emeritus of Mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, clarifies the usage of "squirrel" and related terms: "The squirrel family includes ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots, prairie dogs, and flying squirrels, but to most people squirrel refers to the 122 species of tree squirrels, which belong to 22 genera of the subfamily Sciurinae."
Current taxonomy, based on genetic data, splits the tree squirrels into several subfamilies. The following genera of the squirrel family are classified as tree squirrels.
Relationship with humans.
Squirrels are generally inquisitive and persistent animals. In residential neighborhoods, they are notorious for tenaciously trying to circumvent obstacles in order to eat from bird feeders. Although they are expert climbers, and primarily arboreal, some species of squirrels also thrive in urban environments, where they have adapted to humans.
As pests.
Squirrels are sometimes considered pests because of their propensity to chew on various edible and inedible objects, and their stubborn persistence in trying to get what they want. Their characteristic gnawing trait also aids in maintaining sharp teeth, and because their teeth grow continuously, prevents their over-growth. On occasion, squirrels will chew through plastic and even metal to get to food.
Tree squirrels may bury food in the ground for later retrieval. Birds, especially crows, will sometimes watch a squirrel bury a nut, then dig it up as soon as the squirrel leaves. Squirrels use their keen sense of smell to search for buried food, but can dig numerous holes in the process. This may become an annoyance to gardeners with strict landscape requirements, especially when the garden contains edibles.
Homeowners in areas with a heavy squirrel population must be vigilant in keeping attics, basements, and sheds carefully sealed to prevent property damage caused by nesting squirrels. A squirrel nest is called a "drey".
Squirrels are a serious fire hazard when they break into buildings. They often treat exposed power cables as tree branches, and gnaw on the electrical insulation. The resulting exposed conductors can short out, causing a fire. For this reason alone, squirrel nests inside buildings cannot be safely ignored. A squirrel nest will also cause problems with noise, excreta, unpleasant odors, and eventual structural damage.
Some homeowners resort to more interesting ways of dealing with this problem, such as collecting and placing fur from pets such as domestic cats and dogs in attics. It is hoped that this fur would indicate to nesting squirrels that a potential predator roams, and will encourage evacuation. Odoriferous repellents, including mothballs and ammonia, are generally ineffective in expelling squirrels from buildings.
Once established in a nest, squirrels stubbornly ignore fake owls and scarecrows, along with bright flashing lights, loud noises, and ultrasonic or electromagnetic devices. However, squirrels must leave the nest to obtain food and water (usually daily, except in bad weather), affording an opportunity to trap them or exclude them from re-entering.
To discourage chewing on an object, it can be coated or covered with something to make it distasteful: for instance a soft cloth doused with chili pepper paste or powder. Capsaicin and Ro-pel are other forms of repellent. To remain effective, the coating must be renewed regularly, especially if it is exposed to the weather. Poisoning squirrels can be problematic because of the risks to innocent parties, and because the odor of a dead squirrel in an attic or wall cavity is very unpleasant and persistent.
Trapping is often necessary to remove squirrels from residential structures. Effective baits include fruit, peanut butter, nuts, seeds and vanilla extract.
An alternative method is to wait until squirrels have left in search of food, and then close up all their access openings, or to install one-way trap doors or a carefully angled pipe. Attempting to get rid of all squirrels in a neighborhood is generally a futile goal; the focus instead should be on physically excluding them from places where they can do damage. There are other humane techniques to remove squirrels from buildings, but removal is ineffective unless steps are taken to prevent them from immediately breaking in again.
Squirrels are often the cause of power outages. They can readily climb a power pole and crawl or run along a power cable. The animals will climb onto power transformers or capacitors looking for food, or a place to cache acorns. If they touch a high voltage conductor and a grounded portion of the enclosure at the same time, they are electrocuted, and often cause a short circuit that shuts down equipment. Squirrels have brought down the high-tech NASDAQ stock market twice and were responsible for a spate of power outages at the University of Alabama. To sharpen their teeth, squirrels will often chew on tree branches or even the occasional live power line. Rubber or plastic plates, or freely rotating sleeves ("squirrel guards") are sometimes used to discourage access to these facilities.
Otherwise, squirrels are safe neighbors that appear to pose almost zero risk of transmitting rabies.
Squirrels cause economic losses to homeowners, nut growers, and forest managers in addition to damage to electric transmission lines. These losses include direct damage to property, repairs, lost revenue and public relations. While dollar costs of these losses are sometimes calculated for isolated incidents, there is no tracking system to determine the total extent of the losses.
As roadkill and traffic hazards.
In regions where squirrels are plentiful, a tire-flattened one is a common sight on roadways, especially in the spring and fall, when there is a fresh crop of young rodents. Motorists have caused serious accidents by trying to swerve or stop to avoid a squirrel in the road. Such evasive maneuvers are pointless, since squirrels are much more agile and have much quicker reaction times than motorists in heavy vehicles. There is very little a driver can do to avoid an unpredictably darting squirrel, or even to intentionally hit one. A humane and prudent course of action is to continue driving in a predictable, safe manner, and let the squirrel decide on the spur of the moment which way to run; the majority of vehicular encounters end with no harm to either party. Alternatively, a motorist facing a squirrel in their path can gently press the brake pedal, if traffic conditions permit, while simultaneously beeping the horn.
As urban wildlife.
Tree squirrels are a common type of urban wildlife. They can be trained to be hand-fed and will take as much food as is available because they cache the surplus. Squirrels living in parks and campuses in cities have learned that humans are typically a ready source of food. Urban squirrels have learned to get a lot of food from generous or careless humans. A commonly given food is peanuts, but recent studies show that raw peanuts contain a trypsin inhibitor that prevents the absorption of protein in the intestines. Therefore offering peanuts that have been roasted is the better option. However, wildlife rehabilitators in the field have noted that neither raw nor roasted peanuts nor sunflower seeds are healthy for squirrels, because they are deficient in several essential nutrients. This type of deficiency has been found to cause metabolic bone disease, a somewhat common ailment found in malnourished squirrels.
As food.
In the US.
Squirrel meat is considered a favored meat in certain regions of the United States where it can be listed as wild game. This is evidenced by a number of recipes for its preparation (e.g. Brunswick stew) found in cookbooks, including pre-1997 copies of "The Joy of Cooking". Squirrel meat can be substituted for rabbit or chicken in many recipes, though it may have a gamey taste if handled improperly.
Although squirrel meat is low in fat content, unlike most game meat it has been found by the American Heart Association to be high in cholesterol.
In many areas of the US squirrels are still hunted for food, as they were in earlier years. During the 2008 US election, Republican presidential candidate and Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee mentioned his experiences eating squirrel during an interview with "Meet the Press" anchor Tim Russert.
In the UK.
For most of the history of the United Kingdom, squirrel has been a meat not commonly eaten, and even scorned by many.
But in the early 21st century, wild squirrel has become a more popular meat to cook with, showing up in restaurants and shops more often in Britain as a fashionable alternative meat. Specifically, UK citizens are cooking with the invasive gray squirrel, which is being praised for its low fat content and the fact that it comes from free range sources. Additionally, the novelty of a meat considered unusual or special has added to the spread of squirrel consumption. Due to the difficulty of a clean kill and other factors, the majority of squirrel eaten in the UK is acquired from professional hunters, trappers, and gamekeepers.
Some Britons are eating the gray squirrel as a direct attempt to help the native red squirrel, which has been dwindling since the 19th-century introduction of the gray squirrel, resulting in dramatic habitat loss for the indigenous red squirrels. This factor was marketed by a national "Save Our Squirrels" campaign that used the slogan, "Save a red, eat a grey!"
Risks of eating.
As with other wild game and fish species, the consumption of squirrels that have been exposed to high levels of pollution or toxic waste poses a health risk to humans. In 2007 in the northern New Jersey community of Ringwood, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services issued a warning to anyone who eats squirrel (especially for children and pregnant women) to limit their consumption after a lead-contaminated squirrel was found near the Ringwood Mines Landfill. Toxic waste had been illegally dumped at this location for many years, before authorities cracked down on this practice in the 1980s. The warning especially affects the local Ramapough Mountain Indians, who have hunted and consumed squirrels from before European contact. The hunting and eating of squirrels is considered to be one of this people's time-honored traditions, linking them through a process of cultural identity to their ancestors, and to each other. On learning of the ban on squirrel meat consumption, one member of the Ramapough Tribe told a reporter, "I feel my ancestry is disappearing, my heritage".
In 1997, doctors in Kentucky warned of possible hazards from eating squirrel brains, which are considered a folk delicacy in the region. In western parts of the state, the doctors found a greatly elevated human incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rarely seen but serious prion-based disorder that causes dementia and eventual death. So-called "mad squirrel disease" can be difficult to distinguish from the usual behavior of squirrels, but could be more prevalent among roadkilled animals. Some squirrel eaters have special rituals for preparing and eating the brain, while others avoid eating it altogether.
In culture.
Despite periodic complaints about the animal as a pest, general public opinion towards the animal is favorable. Squirrels are popular characters in many forms of media. An early cultural reference to a specific-named squirrel is "Ratatoskr", a mythological Norse squirrel that carries messages by running up and down the world tree "Yggdrasil". The Ratatoskr myth dates back to the Early Middle Ages, and possibly earlier.
Literary references to squirrels include the works of Beatrix Potter, Brian Jacques' Redwall series (including Jess Squirrel and numerous other squirrels), Pattertwig in C. S. Lewis' "Prince Caspian", Michael Tod's Woodstock Saga of novels featuring squirrel communities in the style of "Watership Down", and the Starwife and her subjects from Robin Jarvis's Deptford novels. The title character in Miriam Young's 1964 children's book "Miss Suzy" is a squirrel.
Squirrels are also popular characters in cartoons, such as Scrat from "Ice Age", Slappy Squirrel of the "Animaniacs", Sandy Cheeks from "SpongeBob SquarePants", Hammy from "Over the Hedge", Benny in "The Wild", Rodney and Leon and Darlene from "Squirrel Boy", Secret Squirrel, Screwy Squirrel, Nutty from "Happy Tree Friends", and Rocky, Bullwinkle's adventuring partner. Bubbles from The Powerpuff Girls cartoon has the superhero ability to communicate with squirrels, which she does by saying ""Chee, chee, che-chee, chee, chee..."".
Video games include squirrel characters such as Rare's Conker series starring Conker the Squirrel, as well as Ocean Software's Mr. Nutz. There is even a squirrel-themed super-heroine, Squirrel Girl. The popular Pokémon game includes a squirrel-like character by the name of Pachirisu.
There are also numerous references to squirrels in the music industry, including the North Carolina group Squirrel Nut Zippers, the electronica group Techno Squirrels, the now-defunct Florida band called For Squirrels (who claimed that they performed their music for squirrels), a children's music group called The Nutty Squirrels, and even a record label with the name Blank Squirrel Musics. There is also a student-run radio station at Kent State University called Black Squirrel Radio.
Albino and white squirrels.
One of the ways that squirrels impact human society is inspired by the fascination that people seem to have over local populations of white squirrels (often misidentified as being albino). This manifests itself by the creation of social group communities that form from a commonly shared interest in these rare animals. Other impacts on human society inspired by white squirrels include the creation of organizations that seek to protect them from human predation, and the use of the white squirrel image as a cultural icon.
Although these squirrels are commonly referred to as "albinos", most of them are likely non-albino squirrels that exhibit a rare white fur coloration known as leucism that is as a result of a recessive gene found within certain Eastern gray squirrel ("Sciurus carolinensis") populations, and so technically they ought to be referred to as "white" squirrels, instead of "albino".
A project run by Untamed Science is seeking to report and document the occurrence of both white squirrels, albinos, and other piebald morphs. Users are encouraged to submit their sightings.
Local pride.
Olney, Illinois, known as the "White Squirrel Capital of the World", is home of the world's largest known white squirrel colony. These squirrels have the right of way on all streets in the town, with a $500 fine for hitting one. The Olney Police Department features the image of a white squirrel on its officers' uniform patches.
Along with Olney, there are four other towns in North America that avidly compete with each other to be the official "Home of the White Squirrel", namely: Marionville, Missouri; Brevard, North Carolina; Exeter, Ontario; and Kenton, Tennessee, each of which holds an annual white squirrel festival, among other things designed to promote their claim of "White Squirrel Capital".
A list of white squirrel sightings around the world is maintained by the White Squirrel Research Institute, a group based in Brevard, North Carolina.
Other towns that have reported white squirrel populations in North America (although not necessarily competing to be the "official" white squirrel capital) include Columbia, Mississippi; Dayton, Ohio; DeForest, Wisconsin; Queenstown, Maryland; Stratford, Connecticut; and some of the snowbelt cities in the Western, Central and Finger Lakes regions of New York State (Buffalo, Rochester, Ithaca and Syracuse). White squirrels have also been spotted in Broad Ripple Village, Indianapolis.
Campus populations.
In addition to the various towns that boast of their white squirrel populations, a number of university campuses in North America have white squirrels. The University of Texas at Austin is home to a white squirrel population which has spurred the myth of the albino squirrel as a good luck charm. There are many versions of the tale; one of the more popular versions is if one spots the albino squirrel before an exam, they will ace it. The University of North Texas has an Albino Squirrel Preservation Society, founded in 2001. In 2006, the University of North Texas held a student referendum to name their white squirrel as the university's secondary mascot, but the vote was narrowly defeated by the student body. University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire has a significant white squirrel population both on the campus and in other areas of the city of Eau Claire. Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan is home to frequently sighted white squirrels that live on and around the campus. A Facebook group dedicated to these squirrels, called "I've Seen the Albino Squirrel of Michigan Tech", was created for people to post photographs and anecdotes of their encounters with the white squirrels, and includes some stories from Michigan Tech alumni that recall seeing white squirrels in Houghton dating back to the 1930s.
In Kentucky, the University of Louisville has established its own chapter of the"Albino Squirrel Preservation Society", which maintains contact with its members and interested parties through a Facebook group by that name. The university has an open policy to give away a free t-shirt to anyone who takes a photograph of a white squirrel on campus grounds and brings it to the administration offices.
Other university campuses that have albino squirrel populations include Oberlin College in Ohio, Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky (which has had a population of albino squirrels since the 1960s), and Youngstown State University in Youngstown, Ohio.
Dr. Michael Stokes, a biology professor at Western Kentucky University, commented that the probable cause for the abundance of white squirrels on university campuses was because they were originally introduced by someone: "We're not sure how they got here, but I'll tell you how it usually happens...When you see them, especially around a college campus or parks, somebody brought them in because they thought it would be neat to have white squirrels around."
Dr. Albert Meier, another biology professor at Western Kentucky University, added that: "... white squirrels rarely survive in the wild because they can't easily hide. But on a college campus, they are less likely to be consumed by other animals."

In folklore.
A story in which a Nāga shapeshifts into a white or albino squirrel, is killed by a hunter, and is magically transformed into meat equal to 8,000 cartloads figures prominently in the folklore of rocket festival traditions and the origin of Nong Han Kumphawapi Lake in Northeast Thailand.
Red and gray squirrels in the UK.
A decline of the red squirrel and the rise of the Eastern gray squirrel, an import from North America, has been widely remarked upon in British popular culture. It is mostly regarded as the invading grays driving out the native red species. Evidence also shows that gray squirrels are vectors of the squirrel parapoxvirus for which no vaccine is currently available, and which is deadly to red squirrels but does not seem to affect the non-native host. Currently the red squirrel only survives in a few isolated areas of the UK, coniferous forests in Scotland, and in England's Formby, the Lake District, Brownsea Island, and the Isle of Wight. The majority of England's red squirrels are found in the county of Northumberland. Special measures are in place to contain and remove any infiltration of gray squirrels into these areas.
As the Eastern gray squirrel is regarded as vermin it is illegal to release any into the wild; any caught have to be humanely destroyed.

Sanford played 11 Test matches for the West Indies, taking 15 wickets in five Tests in the 2001-02 home series against India, when he became the first indigenous Carib to play for the West Indies. He also went on tour of New Zealand in June 2002, but after taking five wickets in two Tests including a bowling analysis of one for 101 in the final match, he was dropped for the tour of India the following season. 
Sanford returned to the side a year and a half later, playing two Tests against South Africa and taking seven wickets, before rounding off his career so far with two home Tests against England. His bowling on that series was criticised by TV commentator and former Test player Geoff Boycott, who claimed that Sanford "couldn't have got granny out". Sanford was dropped again after the second Test against England, and has not returned to the side, although he still plays for Leeward Islands. 
Sanford's brother, the lesser known Benjy Sanford, continues to play cricket in England in the Middlesex Sunday league. His right arm off-spin action has been the subject of a number of notable appearances (most famously, his 6-11 rout of Barnet Synagogue CC in 2011). Having never formally met his brother in recent years for "personal reasons", Benjy has not been the subject of any contractual interest by a professional body; despite his significantly improved bowling statistics over his more famous relation.

Every year in November hundreds of racing drivers and riders compete in different categories of motor-racing, including single-seaters, touring cars and motorbikes.
One of the highlights of the race weekend is the Macau Formula Three Grand Prix, which features many national Formula 3 champions and drivers around the world. Due to the challenging nature of the circuit, which consists of fast straights (a Formula Three car can reach a top speed of at the end of this stretch), tight corners and uncompromising crash barriers, the Macau Grand Prix is famously known as one of the most demanding circuits in the world. Many current or former Formula One drivers have participated in the event early in their careers and some of them have won the prestigious prize. Famous winners include Riccardo Patrese, Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, David Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher and Takuma Sato.
Since 2005, the double-header Guia Race of Macau, which traditionally features touring cars from world-renowned car manufacturers, has officially become the final two races of the FIA World Touring Car Championship (WTCC).
History.
The Macau Grand Prix was originally conceived in 1954 as a treasure hunt around the streets of the city, but shortly after it was suggested that the hunt's track could host a professional racing event for local motor enthusiasts. The race continued as an amateur race until 1966, when Belgian driver Mauro Bianchi entered the race in an Alpine A220 (chassis #1722). Alpine Renault had also sent engineer, Jean-Paul Castilleux, to assist Bianchi with technical aspect of the car. Bianchi's victory and exposure led to more professional racing teams entering the Grand Prix in the following years.
The motorcycle race was introduced in 1967, and in that year the first fatal tragedy struck the race: double champion Dodjie Laurel was killed when he lost control of his car and crashed. This raised the alarm for more safety improvements for the race.
The first Guia race for touring cars was held in 1972. Macau's Guia Race for touring cars is a particular race for this category, as very few races with these cars are held on street circuits. Since 2005 the race has officially become the final two rounds of FIA World Touring Car Championship.
In 1983, it was decided by the organisers that since Formula Pacific was becoming obsolete, the race would be held as a Formula Three event. Initially, they wanted to run a F2 race, but as they were unwilling to make any large circuit modifications, which included cutting down trees, the organisers settled for F3. This turned out to be a right decision, given the fact that since then it has raised the reputation of the event in the motorsport world by attracting the best young drivers from Europe and Japan to compete in the event. The first F3 race was won by a young Ayrton Senna. The race in 1990 was a memorable one, as Michael Schumacher and Mika Häkkinen were involved in an incident when they were in positions 1 and 2 going into the final lap. At the main straight just after the Mandarin Oriental Bend, Häkkinen hit the back of Schumacher's car and crashed out when he attempted to overtake him. Schumacher's car was able to continue with its rear wing damaged and eventually won the race with the best aggregate time. Other notable winners include Formula One drivers David Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher and Takuma Sato. Since the introduction of F3 races, the Macau GP has gradually become a stepping stone for many F3 drivers to higher class motor-racing competitions such as the GP2 series and Formula One.
Macau is a special event for motorcycle riders too. The Motorcycle Grand Prix has featured many famous riders such as Kevin Schwantz, Carl Fogarty, Ron Haslam and Michael Rutter.
Teddy Yip was one of the main forces behind the Macau Grand Prix back in '70s and 80s, leading the Grand Prix to be one of the world's most famous motor racing events. The Macau Grand Prix parties he hosted for many years at his home also became a central part of the social aspect of the Grand Prix.
Today.
The Macau Grand Prix race weekend normally starts on the Thursday and ends on the Sunday on the second or third week of November. The first two days (Thursday and Friday) are generally scheduled for practicing and qualifying. All races are held on Saturday and Sunday, with the final rounds of the heavyweights Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix and the Guia Race (scheduled to be the final 2 rounds of the FIA World Touring Car Championship since 2005) held on the last day. Both the Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix and the Guia Race are sanctioned by the FIA and the winner of the Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix is awarded the FIA Intercontinental Cup. Apart from the two major races held at the race weekend, the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix is also one of the highlights of the weekend since it features former or current racers of the Superbike World Championship. Other races include the "Formula BMW Pacific" race, and for locals and Hong Kong drivers who want a slice of the action, "Interport Race" for novices, "CTM Cup" race the experienced.
Newly introduced into the 2007 race is the "Road Sport Challenge" for popular sport compact cars commonly associated with the tuner market, Macau GT Cup for GT3 cars.
Races that have been held in the past but have since been discontinued includes the "ATCS" race, "Supercar Cup" for road going exotic sports cars, the Formula Renault race, the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia race, the scooter race for locals and in the past but on a less than frequent basis, a Jackie Chan endorsed race for celebrity women drivers (partnered with pro racers) involving Mitsubishis, with whom Chan hold a sponsorship deal.
The Guia circuit.
Characteristics: A street circuit with a combination of fast straights and tight corners. It is recognised, as one of the most challenging circuits in the world.

Mabel Mercer

Mabel Mercer (3 February 1900 – 20 April 1984) was an English-born cabaret singer who performed in the United States, Britain, and Europe with the greats in jazz and cabaret. She was a featured performer at Chez Bricktop in Paris, owned by the hostess Bricktop, and performed in such clubs as Le Ruban Bleu, Tony's, the RSVP, the Carlyle, the St. Regis Hotel, and eventually her own room, the Byline Club. Among those who frequently attended Mercer's shows was Frank Sinatra, who made no secret of his emulating her phrasing and story-telling techniques.
Early life.
Mercer was born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England. Her mother was a young, white English music hall performer, and her father was a black American jazz musician whom Mabel never knew. At age fourteen, she left her convent school in Manchester, and toured Britain and Europe with her aunt in vaudeville and music hall engagements.
Career.
In 1928, she was an unknown member of the black chorus in the London production of "Show Boat", but she had become the toast of Paris by the 1930s, with admirers who included Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Cole Porter.
When World War II broke out, she traveled to America to sing in the finest supper clubs in New York City. Her recording career began in 1942, with an album of selections from "Porgy and Bess" on the elite Liberty Music Shops label, featuring piano accompaniment by Cy Walter. Over the following decades, Mercer made many concert appearances across the U.S. In the late 1960s, she gave two concerts with Bobby Short at Town Hall in New York City. Both were released by Atlantic Records: "Mabel Mercer & Bobby Short at Town Hall," in 1968, (Atlantic SD 2-604) and "Mabel Mercer & Bobby Short Second Town Hall Concert," in 1969 (Atlantic SD 2-605). In 1969, she made two appearances on the television program "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood".
Her original and reissued albums are collector's items. Atlantic Records reissued four of her early LPs in a boxed set in 1975, in honor of her 75th birthday. She was awarded "Stereo Review" Magazine's first Award for Merit, for her lifetime achievement and for "outstanding contributions to the quality of American musical life." This award was officially renamed the Mabel Mercer Award in 1984.
Late career.
When Mercer returned on 4 July 1977 for her first performance in England in 41 years, the BBC filmed three evenings' performances and later broadcast it in a week-long late-night television program, a BBC first for an entertainer.
In 1978, "Midnight at Mabel Mercer's," her 1956 album on Atlantic, was praised as "one of the best recordings of the past twenty years" (although it was more than twenty years old at the time) by Stereo Review. That same year, Mercer played at San Francisco's Club Mocambo to sold-out audiences, in celebration of her 78th birthday.
In 1982. Mercer teamed up with her dear friend Eileen Farrell in concert as part of the Kool Jazz Festival. Farrell often expressed it was the one pirated record she wished she had!
Honors.
In January 1981, she was honored by the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York with "An American Cabaret," the only musical event of its kind at that point in the museum's history. Mercer was the first guest on Eileen Farrell's new program featuring great popular singers, on National Public Radio.
Mercer received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian medal, in 1983.
When President Ronald Reagan presented it to her in a ceremony at the White House, he called her "a singer's singer" and "a living testament to the artfulness of the American song". She also received two honorary Doctor of Music degrees: one from Boston's Berklee College of Music, the other from the New England Conservatory of Music.
Mabel Mercer died on 20 April 1984, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
The Mabel Mercer Foundation.
In 1985, the Mabel Mercer Foundation was established with the efforts of her long-time friend and professional associate Donald F. Smith. This not-for-profit arts organization was formed to keep Mercer's memory alive, and to contribute to the art of cabaret performing by supporting artists and providing information resources. Its international activities include the debut of the London Cabaret Convention in 2004. The Foundation produced Noël Coward's 100th birthday celebration at Carnegie Hall, and also has a Young Person's Series to introduce young people to The Great American Songbook of popular classics.

Menomonee River

The Menomonee River is one of three primary rivers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Description.
Named after the Menomonee (also spelled Menominee) Indians, the word was given to the Menomonee people by the Chippewa people, and in the Chippewa language literally means "rice eaters" referring to the abundant wild rice that once grew along its shores in the Menomonee Valley. A tributary of the Milwaukee River, it is the most industrialized within the Milwaukee River Basin.
Watershed.
The Menomonee River is long, with a watershed that covers approximately of urban landscape and is home to a population of more than 336,670 people. This includes portions of Washington, Ozaukee, Waukesha, and Milwaukee counties. A large swath of the river has been heavily channelized and industrialized as it runs through the Menomonee Valley. This has become a primary source of pollution for the river.
Its estuary empties into Lake Michigan from the Milwaukee River near the Milwaukee harbor, along with the Kinnickinnic River to the south.

Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies

The Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies (HJAS) is an English-language scholarly journal published by the Harvard-Yenching Institute. "HJAS" features articles and book reviews of current scholarship in East Asian Studies, focusing on Chinese, Japanese, and Korean history, literature and religion, with occasional coverage of politics and linguistics.
History.
Serge Elisséeff founded the "Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies" in 1936 under the auspices of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, an independent, non-profit organization founded in 1928 to further the spread of knowledge and scholarship on East and Southeast Asia. Elisséeff's wide range of knowledge came to be reflected in the diverse character of the journal during the twenty-one years he served as its editor (1936-1957). 
Since the days of Elisséeff, the journal has been guided by:
Publishing History.
The journal was published three times yearly from its inception until 1947. From 1948 until 1957 it was released biannually, but from 1958 to 1976 the journal was released only annually or in two-year periods. Since 1977 it has been published twice yearly in June and December.

A.W.O.L. is the fifth studio album by rapper AZ, released on September 6, 2005. It was recorded after "Final Call", which AZ declined to release because his label had pushed its release back two months—according to him, they were also the source of its early leak to the press and the internet. Garnering critical praise with production from highly regarded New York underground acts such as DJ Premier, Buckwild, and DipSet production duo the Heatmakerz, the rapper abandoned his previously money-oriented subject matter, stating that he "wanted it to be all street. "A.W.O.L." is the first AZ album which was released on his own Quiet Money Records imprint. In a couple of months after the release, "A.W.O.L. 1.5", which included a bonus disc featuring a cappella and instrumental versions to the songs on "A.W.O.L.", was released.

Isles Phelipeaux and Pontchartrain

Isle Phelipeaux (or Île Philippaux) and Isle Pontchartrain are phantom islands in 
Lake Superior, believed at one time to be real, shown on early maps, such as the Mitchell Map, of 
Lake Superior as located between the Keweenaw Peninsula and Isle Royale.
Although non-existent, Isle Phelipeaux was referenced in the 1783 Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolutionary War. A portion of the boundary between the United States and British colonies in Canada was described as running "through Lake Superior northward of the Isles Royal and Phelipeaux to the Long Lake." It had first appeared on a map prepared by the cartographer Bellin in 1744. It continued to appear on maps of Lake Superior for many years, including the Mitchell map used in the Paris peace talks, in 1783.
During the 1820s, when surveys were attempting to determine the International Boundary from the Lake of the Woods to Lake Superior, it was discovered that Isle Phelipeaux did not exist; surveyors were also unable to determine what body of water was meant by the "Long Lake" referenced in the treaty.
A likely reason given for the appearance on maps of these islands was to curry favor with the French government minister, Louis Phélypeaux, marquis de La Vrilliere, comte de Pontchartrain, in order to gain funding for additional voyages of exploration.

District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority

The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DC Water) provides drinking water, sewage collection and sewage treatment in Washington, D.C., USA. DC Water also provides wholesale wastewater treatment services to several adjoining municipalities in Maryland and Virginia. In addition, DC Water provides maintenance and repair of more than 9,000 public fire hydrants on behalf of the District of Columbia. DC Water was created in 1996, when the District Government and the U.S. federal government established it as an independent authority of the District government.
DC Water provides more than 600,000 residents, 16.6 million annual visitors and 700,000 people who are employed in the District of Columbia with water, sewage and wastewater treatment. DC Water also provides wholesale wastewater treatment for 1.6 million people in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties in Maryland, and Fairfax and Loudoun counties in Virginia.
In 2010, under new leadership, the Authority underwent a rebranding effort. The rebranding included a new logo, new color palette, and a new name. Since its inception, the Authority had been doing business as DC WASA. The legal name remains the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority.
History.
Drinking water.
In 1852 Congress commissioned the construction of an aqueduct system to provide a reliable supply of drinking water to the city from the Potomac River. The US Army Corps of Engineers designed and built the Washington Aqueduct, which began full operation in 1864. Filtration plants were added to the system in the 20th century.
Wastewater Treatment.
In 1938 the District of Columbia built a sewage treatment plant in the Blue Plains area, at the southernmost tip of DC. The cost was $4 million. The plant was built to stop raw sewage from going into the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. At that time the plant was built to treat sewage from a population of 650,000, but by 1943 the population grew to 1.5 million people, contributing much more sewage, and upgrades to the plant were necessary.
Governance.
An eleven-member Board of Directors governs DC Water. The District is represented by six Board Members. Prince George's County and Montgomery County each have two Board Members. Fairfax County has a single Board Member. Each participating jurisdiction is a signatory to the "Blue Plains Intermunicipal Agreement," which spells out the roles and responsibilities for each party, and addresses facilities management, capacity allocation and financing.
The Authority develops its own budget. which is then included in the overall District of Columbia budget. Together these two budgets are presented annually to Congress for approval.
When DC Water was created as an independent authority in 1996, its finances were separate from those of the District of Columbia. The independence of DC Water with regard to finance, procurement and personnel matters was affirmed by Congress under the "District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority Independence Preservation Act" of 2008. 
Operations.
A General Manager is responsible for all daily operations and reports to the DC Water Board of Directors.
DC Water purchases drinking water from the Washington Aqueduct division of the Army Corps of Engineers. The Aqueduct sources the water from the Potomac River at Great Falls and Little Falls, north of the District. The Aqueduct treats the water and DC Water distributes it through of water pipes throughout the District of Columbia.
DC Water also manages of sewer lines and operates the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant. The plant discharges to the Potomac River at the southernmost tip of the District.
Awards.
The National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA) honored DC Water with its Research and Technology Award, given annually to member agencies who contribute to the field of biosolids usage and disposal or wastewater treatment. The research project must be completed in-house (or by a contractor working directly with the agency) and it must relate to the collection process, treatment process, or reuse of wastewater. This innovation by the DC Water team has global impact in protecting aquatic life in waterways that receive wastewater discharges. The year 2010 marks the second consecutive year that DC Water has been recognized with this award.
In 2010, DC Water received from NACWA the Platinum Peak Performance Award after receiving five consecutive Gold Awards for 100 percent compliance with permit limits. This Award is presented to member agencies for exceptional compliance for their National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit limits.
Funding.
Rates paid by ratepayers cover the cost of delivery of water and sewer service. A little more than half of the rates cover operations. Another quarter covers the cost of capital projects like replacement of aging water and sewer lines, valve replacements and pump station improvements. Capital projects also include several projects designed to protect the environment, and are required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Though the mandate comes from the federal government, the funding sources for these construction projects are not identified. While a small amount of funding has come through the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act and other grants, the majority of these capital costs are borne by the ratepayers.
Environmental stewardship.
At Blue Plains, wastewater treatment goes beyond primary and secondary treatment levels, to tertiary (or advanced) treatment. The effluent that leaves Blue Plains and is discharged to the Potomac is highly treated and meets some of the most stringent NPDES permit limits in the United States.
Historically, wastewater treatment plants have contributed nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen to the waterways in which they discharge. These nutrients have been found to deplete oxygen in the marine environment, a process that is detrimental to fish and other aquatic life.
Since the mid-1980s, Blue Plains has reduced phosphorus to the limit of technology, primarily in support of water quality goals of the Potomac River, but also for the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. The "Chesapeake Bay Agreement," reached in 1987, was a first step in reducing nitrogen discharge to waterways that are tributary to the Chesapeake Bay. Under the agreement, the Bay states and the District committed to voluntarily reduce nitrogen loads by 40 percent from their 1985 levels. Blue Plains was the first plant to achieve that goal. Furthermore, in every year since the full-scale implementation of the Biological Nitrogen Removal (BNR) process was completed in 2000, Blue Plains has every year successfully achieved and exceeded that goal of a 40 percent reduction. In Fiscal Year 2009, the BNR process at Blue Plains reduced the nitrogen load by more than 58 percent.
DC Water and EPA agreed upon new nitrogen limits as part of the NPDES permit. effective September 2010. reducing nitrogen levels to 4.7 million pounds per year. DC Water plans to achieve these levels by constructing new facilities at Blue Plains to perform enhanced nitrogen removal (ENR). The total cost of the project is nearly $1 billion.
In FY 09, the Authority rehabilitated pumping equipment and accessories in one of two stations that pump incoming wastewater into the plant and replaced aged infrastructure and equipment in the plant’s final filters with a more effective system. All the upgrade projects were tied into the plant-wide process control system (PCS), which monitors and controls the plant’s processes from a central location.
Progress was achieved in implementing the nitrification/denitrification facilities upgrade to convert nitrification reactors from coarse to fine bubble diffusion and to modify structures and equipment. The rehabilitated and new equipment will support other ongoing upgrades to the nitrification/denitrification process, and aims to meet the nitrogen reduction goals of the Chesapeake Bay Program. It will also increase energy efficiency.
On the waterways, the Authority operates two skimmer boats that remove floatable debris from the Anacostia and Potomac rivers every Monday through Friday. These crews remove more than 400 tons of trash from our waterways each year.
Plastic bottles, plastic bags, inflatable toys, baseballs and environmental debris like tree limbs, are all skimmed from the waterways and deposited into oversized dumpsters for removal. In decades past, there used to be larger items, such as sofas and refrigerators. But over the years, the skimmer boats have removed most of those. Still, there is the occasional unlikely item, such as the live deer that was recently rescued to dry ground.
In addition to their full-time work assignments, these crews clean the way for special events like the Nation’s Triathlon and high school crew competitions, as well as for conservation efforts.
As a result of the work DC Water contributes, “The District, as a city, is head and shoulders above any other municipality in the Bay watershed,” said Tom Schueler of the nonprofit Chesapeake Stormwater Network. In 2009, The Stormwater Network developed a stormwater performance grading scale in which the District received the highest grade of B+ and others went on score as low as Cs and even Ds.
DC Water Clean Rivers Project.
The District of Columbia is one of 772 older cities in the country with a combined sewer system. The combined sewer system covers about a third of the city, and was built in the late 19th century to carry both sanitary sewage and storm water in the same pipe. The system operates well in dry weather. However, during rainstorms, the flow can exceed the capacity of the pipe. To prevent sewer backups and flooded streets, these combined sewers may discharge into the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers and Rock Creek, a phenomenon known as combined sewer overflows (CSOs).
To date, DC Water has significantly reduced CSOs by eliminating approximately 40 percent of the overflows through a $140 million program. This investment included inflatable dams to catch and store overflows during rain storms; tide gates to keep river water from flowing into the sewer system; sewer separation to eliminate CSO outfalls; and pumping station construction and rehabilitation to increase flow capacity. A deep underground tunnel system is employed in a $2.4 billion, 20-year DC Water Clean Rivers Project to reduce CSOs by 96 percent overall and 98 percent in the Anacostia River.
This tunnel system will store the combined sewage during wet weather and release it for treatment at Blue Plains once there is capacity in the system.
Controversy.
In 2001, water supplied by the Authority was found to contain lead levels of at least 1,250 parts per billion (ppb)—about 83 times higher than the accepted safe level of 15 ppb. The discovery was made by Marc Edwards, a civil engineering professor specializing in plumbing who DC Water had hired to investigate complaints of plumbing corrosion. DC Water threatened to cut off Edwards's funding unless he abandoned his investigation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report dismissing the idea of health risks from the water.
The story was picked up by the "Washington Post", which ran front-page stories about the problem in January 2004. This led to a Congressional investigation, which found that the CDC had made "scientifically indefensible" claims about the lack of health effects from the lead in DC's water supply.
The problem was traced to the Washington Aqueduct decision to replace the chlorine used to treat the water with chloramine, a similar chemical. Chloramine picks up lead from pipes and solder, keeping it dissolved in the water throughout the system.
In 2010, the CDC said that 15,000 homes in the DC area might still have water supplies with dangerous levels of lead.

Margraviate of Baden

The Margraviate of Baden () was a historical territory of the Holy Roman Empire. Spread along the east side of the Upper Rhine River in southwestern Germany, it was named a margraviate in 1112 and existed until 1803, when it was raised to an electorate. In 1806, the Electorate of Baden, receiving territorial additions, became the Grand Duchy of Baden. The rulers of Baden belonged to the Swabian House of Zähringen.
History.
During the 11th century, the Duchy of Swabia lacked a powerful central authority and was under the control of various comital dynasties, the strongest of them being the House of Hohenstaufen, the House of Welf, the Habsburgs and the House of Zähringen. Emperor Henry III had promised the ducal throne to the Zähringen scion Berthold, however, upon Henry's death in 1056 his widow Agnes of Poitou appointed Rudolf of Rheinfelden Duke of Swabia. Berthold renounced his rights and was compensated with the Duchy of Carinthia and the March of Verona in Italy. Not able to establish himself, he finally lost both territories, when he was deposed by King Henry IV of Germany during the Investiture Controversy in 1077. Berthold retired to his Swabian home territory, where he died the next year. The Veronese margravial title was nevertheless retained by his eldest son Herman I 
Herman II, son of Herman I and grandson of Berthold II, had concluded an agreement with the rivalling Hohenstaufen dynasty, and about 1098 was enfeoffed with immediate territory by Emperor Henry IV. Like his father, Herman II insisted on his margravial title. He chose to establish his residence in Germany, as he had been born and raised there. His lordship of choice was Baden (present-day Baden-Baden), where his father had gained the right to rule by marrying the heiress, Judit von Backnang-Sulichgau, Countess of Eberstein-Calw. In Baden, Herman II had Hohenbaden Castle built. Construction began about 1100, and when completed in 1112, he marked the occasion by adopting the title of a Margrave of Baden. 
Growth.
Because Baden was the capital, the new Margraviate was also known as Baden. Herman II would continue to be Margrave until his death in 1130. His son and grandson, Hermann III (reigned 1130-1160) and Herman IV (reigned 1160-1190), added to their territories. Around 1200, these lands were divided for the first time. Two lines, Baden-Baden and Baden-Hochberg, were founded. The latter was divided about a hundred years later to create the third line – Baden-Sausenberg.
In the 12th and 13th centuries Baden was a loyal and steadfast supporter of the House of Hohenstaufen, even against its own relatives from Zähringen-Swabia. In return for its services, it was permitted to spread its rule throughout southwestern Germany, west across the Rhine River into Alsace, east to the edges of the Black Forest, north to the Murg River and south to the Breisgau. The fourth Margrave of Baden-Baden, Herman V, Margrave of Baden-Baden (reigned 1190-1243), founded the cities of Backnang, Durlach, Stuttgart, Ettlingen, and Pforzheim and several monasteries, including the Lichtenthal Abbey, which became the burial place of his descendants. In 1219 he moved his seat of power to Pforzheim. He had to abandon his claims to Zähringen and Braunschweig, but he gained the title of "Graf" von Ortenau and Breisgau, named the for the two valleys in southern Baden. His son and grandson, Herman VI, Margrave of Baden (reigned 1243-1250) and Frederick I, Margrave of Baden (reigned 1250-1268), claimed the titles of Dukes of Austria and Styria, The Austrians rejected them as they did not want to be ruled by outsiders.
Consolidation.
Margrave Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden (reigned 1391-1431) united all of the acquisitions in 1391. A soldier of some renown, Bernard continued the mission of his predecessors, and gained several more districts, including Baden-Pforzheim and Baden-Hochberg. Since 1291, Baden-Pforzheim had its own Margraviate, but in 1361 it ran out of heirs, falling back to the House of Baden-Baden. Baden-Hochberg fared little better. Founded in 1190, it lasted until 1418, when it too died with no male heirs. Bernard, being the closest heir, claimed Baden-Hochberg. Baden-Sausenberg, continued its own Margraviate until 1503, when the lack of its own heirs sent it back to the House of Baden-Baden.
The consolidation of the Margraviate came in 1442. In that year, one-half of the dominions of Lahr and Mahlberg was brought into the fold, creating the link between the two main areas, the Breisgau in the south and Baden-Baden in the north. Throughout the Late Middle Ages, Baden grew its administration, finances and armies until it became one of the biggest and strongest states of the Holy Roman Empire in southwestern Germany, especially after it gained the Habsburg possessions in the rest of the Ortenau and the Breisgau.
Tribulations.
In 1462 the dispute over the election of the new Archbishop of Mainz sent Charles I (reigned 1453-1475) to fight the war against Frederick I, the Count Palatine of the Rhine. Known as the “Mainz Archbishops’ Feud,” it was brief, lasting only a few months, but the effects were ruinous for the loser – Charles. He had to surrender several of his territories to the Palatinate and its allies. These territories were recovered by his son and successor, Christopher I (reigned 1475-1515). In 1503, the Baden-Sausenberg died without male heirs and all the Badener lands were united by Christopher. He tried to keep them united under one of his sons, Philip, but his efforts were foiled by the King of France. Before his death, Christopher divided the Margraviate between his three sons. Philip succeeded him in 1515 but died childless in 1533, and his share went to his brothers, Bernard and Ernest. In 1535, they made a fresh division of their inheritance. It would be the first of several partitions, establishing the two main lines of the House of Baden – Baden-Baden and Baden-Durlach (Baden-Pforzheim until 1565) – which would last until 1771. However, the relations between the two lines were not peaceful, and the constant fragmentation did not help.
During the Reformation, several branches, led by Baden-Baden, remained on the side of the Catholics, the others joining with Baden-Durlach on the Protestant side. The Thirty Years War made matters worse for all the branches. Many of them were exiled to other countries. Baden suffered severely during the war. The 1648 Treaty of Westphalia restored the branches and their churches to their own lands. Gradually the rivalry subsided. During the wars of Louis XIV, the "Sun King" of France, the two Margraviates were ravaged by the French troops. The forces of the Holy Roman Empire, led by the Margrave of Baden-Baden, “Turk” Louis William (reigned 1677-1707) fought against France.
Reunification.
In 1771, Augustus George became the last Margrave of Baden-Baden when he died without sons. All his territories passed to his nearest heir – the Margrave of Baden-Durlach, Charles Frederick (reigned 1738-1811). For the third and last time, all the Badener lands became united under a single ruler.
Although Baden was finally united, its domains were fragmented and widespread on both sides of the Upper Rhine River, with the total area of 1,350 square miles (3496.48 km2). When Charles Frederick became the Margrave in 1738, he made it his personal mission to fill the gaps in his territories. His first opportunity came in 1792, when war broke out between France and Austria. The Badeners fought for Austria, leaving Baden devastated when they lost. Charles Frederick had to pay an indemnity and cede his territories on the left bank of the Rhine to France. He had his second chance a few years later, as an enemy of Napoleon, on the side of Alexander I, the Tsar of Russia. In 1803, because of the efforts of the Tsar, the Margrave gained the Bishopric of Constance, parts of the Rhenish Palatinate, and several other smaller districts, thereby gaining the dignity of an Elector-Prince.

Jean Spangler

Jean Elizabeth Spangler (September 2, 1923 – disappeared October 7, 1949) was an American dancer, model and bit-part actress in Hollywood films and in early television.
Life and career.
Born in Seattle, Washington, Spangler had danced with the Earl Carroll Theatre and Florentine Gardens. She lived with her mother Florence, five-year-old daughter Christine, brother Edward, and sister-in-law Sophie, on Colgate Avenue in the Park La Brea residential complex near Wilshire Boulevard, in Los Angeles, California.
In 1942, she married manufacturer Dexter Benner. They had a daughter, Christine (born April 22, 1944), and divorced in 1946. Spangler and Benner engaged in a long custody battle over their daughter, until Spangler was awarded custody in 1948.
Disappearance.
On October 7, 1949, Spangler left her home in Los Angeles around 5:00 p.m. She left her daughter with her sister-in-law Sophie, and said that she was meeting her former husband to discuss a late child support payment; after that, she was going to work on a night shoot for a film. The last person to see her was a clerk in a store near her home, who said that she appeared to be waiting for someone. She was never seen again. Spangler's mother was visiting family in Kentucky at the time. Spangler's sister-in-law, Sophie, went to the police and filed a missing person report the next day.
Police investigation.
Though Spangler had told her sister-in-law that she was going to work on a movie set after she met with her ex-husband, this lead went nowhere. She had worked as an extra and bit-part actress for several different Hollywood studios, but none of those studios had any work in progress or were even open on the evening of October 7.
Police questioned Spangler's ex-husband, Dexter Benner, about her statement to her sister-in-law that she was going to meet him about his child support payments. He said that he had not seen his former wife for several weeks before Spangler disappeared. His new wife Lynn Lasky Benner, to whom he had been married only one month, stated that he was with her at the time of the disappearance.
Two days later, on October 9, Spangler's purse was found near the Fern Dell entrance to Griffith Park in Los Angeles, with both of the straps on one side torn loose as if it had been ripped from her arm. Sixty police officers and over one hundred volunteers searched the natural terrain park, but no other clues were found. There was no money in the purse (her sister-in-law said that she had no money when she left her house the evening of her disappearance) so the police ruled out robbery as a motive. There was an unfinished note in the purse addressed to a "Kirk," which read, "Can't wait any longer, Going to see Dr. Scott. It will work best this way while mother is away...". The note ended with a comma as if it had not been finished.
Neither "Kirk" nor "Dr. Scott" could be located, and neither Spangler's family nor her friends knew anyone by those names. When Spangler's mother, Florence, returned to Los Angeles and told police that someone named "Kirk" had picked up Jean at her house twice, but he stayed in his car and did not come in. Police questioned every doctor with the last name Scott in Los Angeles, but none of them had a patient with the last name Spangler or Benner, her former married name. Spangler had once been involved with an abusive man she called "Scotty," but her lawyer said she had not seen him since 1945.
Spangler had recently completed filming a bit part in the film "Young Man with a Horn" starring Kirk Douglas. Douglas was vacationing in Palm Springs when he heard about the disappearance; he called the police and told them he was not the Kirk mentioned in the note. When interviewed by the head of the investigating team, Douglas stated that he had heard of her name, and knew that Spangler had been an extra in his new film, but that he did not know her personally.
Spangler's girlfriends told police that she was three months pregnant when she disappeared and that she had talked about having an abortion, which was illegal at that time. Witnesses, who frequented the same nightclubs and bars that Spangler did, told police they had heard of a former medical student known as "Doc," who performed abortions for money, but police could not locate him, nor prove that he existed.
Spangler had been seen with Davy Ogul, an associate of infamous mobster Mickey Cohen, in Palm Springs, California, who disappeared two days after Spangler did. This led police to investigate the possibility that Spangler and Ogul, who was under indictment for conspiracy, had fled to avoid prosecution. In 1950, a customs agent in El Paso, Texas reported seeing Ogul and a woman who looked like Spangler in a hotel in El Paso. The hotel clerk identified Spangler from a photograph, but neither Davy Ogul nor Jean Spangler's name appeared on the hotel register.
The Los Angeles Police Department continued the search and circulated Spangler's picture for several years, in an unsuccessful attempt to find her or any reliable leads. Columnist Louella Parsons offered a $1,000 reward for information concerning Spangler's disappearance or location. Despite a nationwide search, no further clues have surfaced. Possible sightings included northern and southern California, Phoenix, Arizona, and Mexico City over the next two years, but none of those sightings could be validated. She is still listed as a missing person, and the LAPD has not closed the case.
Media coverage.
An episode of the now-defunct television series "Mysteries and Scandals" featured the case in 2001.
Megan Abbott's 2007 noir novel "The Song is You" centers on the Spangler case.

Yagyū Munetoshi

Yagyū Sekishūsai Taira-no-Munetoshi (柳生石舟斎平宗厳 1529 - May 25, 1606) was a samurai in Japan’s Sengoku period famous for mastering the Shinkage-ryū school of combat, and introducing it to the Tokugawa clan.
Early life.
Munetoshi was born Yagyū Shinsuke in 1529 in Yagyū Village (present day Yagyū, Nara) in Yamato Province. His father, Ietoshi, was a minor landed lord. When Munetoshi was 12, Ietoshi joined a general named Kisawa Nagamasa in contesting the growing power of the warlord Miyoshi Chōkei. However, Kisawa was killed in battle, and the Yagyū found themselves on the defensive. With over half of Yamato Province under his control, Miyoshi left the rest of the conquest to his lieutenant, Tsutsui Junshō.
The Tsutsui and the Yagyū had feuded previously, and Junshō wasted no time. In 1544 he attacked the Yagyū at Koyagyū Castle with some 10,000 men. According to the "Tamon-in Nikki", a chronicle of the Kōfuku-ji temple, at first the Yagyū were caught by surprise, but Ietoshi rallied his troops for a defensive battle. Munetoshi, a young man of 15, ably led a small troop of his own. The Tsutsui troops surrounded the castle, burned the surrounding houses and villages, took control of the outer castle and cut off the water supply, but the main castle still held out. The Yagyū held out or three days, but they were greatly outnumbered, and had no choice but to capitulate, and submit to the Tsutsui.
The Yagyū served the Tsutsui for eight years. Munetoshi studied the martial and liberal arts, becoming proficient with the spear and sword, as well as studying Confucianism, Zen Buddhism, and Shingon Buddhism. Munetoshi soon gained notice as an able warrior and commander, and as many of orders were sent by Tsutsui to him, a young man in his 20s, as were sent to his father, still an active lord in his 50s. One message sent by Junshō’s son Fujikatsu to Ietoshi singles out Munetoshi in particular for praise.
In 1559, the warlord Matsunaga Hisahide decided to attack the Tsutsui and take control of Yamato Province. He sent a message to Munetoshi promising to restore their old lands and position to the Yagyū in exchange for their service. The Tsutsui were overthrown, and the Yagyū grew prominent under Matsunaga. In particular, Matsunaga gave Munetoshi a citation for valor for his performance in a battle at To'unomine. Matsunaga’s attempt to take the mountain was repulsed, and Munetoshi fought in the rearguard as the army retreated. He was wounded, but fighting with a spear he killed several of the enemy. Munetoshi almost did not survive the battle, but a retainer named Matsuda Muneshige sacrificed his life to save Munetoshi’s. Munetoshi would later make mention of his extreme gratitude when he gave a Shinkage-ryū license to Muneshige’s son Genjirō.
It is not entirely clear what school of combat Munetoshi studied, or who his teachers were. An Owari Yagyū family record suggests that he studied Shintō-ryū under a man named Kantori Shinjūrō. But “Kantori” may simply be a misreading of kanji meant to read “Katori”, thus signifying “Katori Shintō-ryū”. An Edo Yagyū family record suggests that he studied Toda-ryū, a branch of Chūjō-ryū. All family records and Munetoshi’s own surviving writings suggest that he was an enthusiastic student of the military arts from a young age, before he met Kamiizumi Hidetsuna.
Encounter with Kamiizumi Hidetsuna.
In 1564, Kamiizumi Ise-no-kami Hidetsuna was travelling to Kyoto with his student and nephew Hikita Bungorō and his long-time student Suzuki Ihaku. While stopping in Ise Province, the group asked the governor, Kitabatake Tomonori, if he knew of any capable samurai nearby interested in a friendly match. Kitabatake recommended Munetoshi and Munetoshi’s friend Kakuzenbō In’ei, a monk and spearsman of the Hōzōin temple. Hidetsuna agreed, and a messenger was sent on ahead to Hōzōin temple to contact the two men.
Munetoshi agreed, and met Hidetsuna at Hōzōin. Accounts differ on the specifics of the match: according to the Edo Yagyū family record "Kyū Yagyū-hanki", Munetoshi faced Hikita Bungoro and was roundly beaten with a fukuro-shinai. An account by Munetoshi’s great-great-grandson Toshinobu says that Munetoshi faced Suzuki Ihaku three times. Based on family documents and oral history, Yagyū Toshinaga suggested that Munetoshi’s opponent was Hidetsuna himself in three matches over three days. In any event, the common point of all the accounts is that Munetoshi lost, and became Hidetsuna’s disciple.
Munetoshi invited Hidetsuna to his land in Yagyū Village, where they trained for the better part of a year. Hidetsuna then went on to Kyoto, giving Munetoshi an assignment. He asked him to research the concept of "Mutō-dori"; facing an armed opponent while unarmed. While Hidetsuna was away Munetoshi devoted himself to this study, and upon Hidetsuna’s return he successfully demonstrated it on Suzuki Ihaku. Hidetsuna, pleased by this innovation, gave Munetoshi an "inka-jō", signifying the highest attainment in Shinkage-ryū and permission to teach it. A year later, Hidetsuna gave Munetoshi the "Kage-mokuroku", a selection of four scrolls detailing the kata of Shinkage-ryū with commentary and drawings by Hidetsuna himself.
In the "Yagyū Kaken", the Yagyū family constitution, Munetoshi wrote that he’d loved the military arts since he was a youth, and studied many ryū, but did not know victory until he met Kamiizumi Hidetsuna. Munetoshi’s service to Matsunaga, and later to Oda Nobunaga would keep him busy following Hidetsuna’s visit in 1567, Munetoshi and Hidetsuna both found themselves living and working in Kyoto in the waning years of the Ashikaga Shogunate, from 1570 to 1572. In 1572 Hidetsuna traveled to Yagyū Village for the last time, staying there an indefinite length of time before heading east to Kōzuke Province, where he was last seen in 1577.
Career as a general.
Munetoshi served Matsunaga with distinction. The battle at To’unomine, for which Munetoshi received a citation of valor, was either just before his encounter with Hidetsuna or shortly after. In 1568, Oda Nobunaga entered Yamato Province with overwhelming force and subjugated the Matsunaga and Tsutsui, ending their skirmishing. It is likely that around this time Ietoshi retired, and passed on the leadership of the Yagyū to Munetoshi. Nobunaga ordered Munetoshi to go to Kyoto and attend to the new Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiaki.
With the passing of a few years, however, Yoshiaki began forming alliances to overthrow Nobunaga, among them the Yagyū’s old lord and present commander Matsunaga Hisahide and the warlord Takeda Shingen. In 1571, attempting to secure control once more over Yamato Province, Matsunaga sent the Yagyū in an attack against Tsutsui Junkei at Tatsuichi, a town in Nara. The attack was a total failure, and in the course of the battle Munetoshi’s oldest son, Toshikatsu, was shot in the hip. This compounded an earlier injury he had received in his first battle, and made him an invalid for life.
Yoshiaki’s coalition made its move against Nobunaga in 1573, but despite early success the death of Takeda Shingen weakened it. Nobunaga drove Yoshiaki out of Kyoto in August, and Matsunaga rejoined Nobunaga to fight the other members of the coalition. It is likely that Munetoshi took part in these battles. However, by 1577 Matsunaga again turned on Nobunaga, who then finally defeated his wayward vassal. It is not clear when, but around this time Munetoshi withdrew from the world of battle, and secluded himself in Yagyū Village.
Seclusion and focus on Shinkage-ryū.
Sometime in the late 1570s, Munetoshi gave up all aspirations of being a general or warlord, and retired to Yagyū Village, where he devoted himself to teaching and training in Shinkage-ryū. It is not exactly clear why, as he was only in his late-40s. The death of Hidetsuna, his teacher, around this time may have been a factor, as well as the fall of the Ashikaga and Matsunaga. Poetry that Munetoshi wrote during this time express doubt and a lack of confidence in anything beyond Shinkage-ryū, and even this skill is compared in utility to a “stone boat”.
Munetoshi spent most of his time teaching Shinkage-ryū to his sons and other men. Licenses given out by him that date back to 1580 survive today. In 1589 he wrote the "Yagyū Kaken" 柳生家憲, a memoir and treatise on proper conduct meant for his descendents. In 1593 he became a Buddhist lay priest, taking the name “Sekishūsai Songon”. This same year, he wrote the "Heihō Hyakka"兵法百歌, “One-hundred Songs of Strategy”, a collection of mostly original poetry on such subjects as the usefulness, training, and goals of the martial arts.
1594 would prove to be an eventful year. Despite his seclusion in Yagyū Village, Munetoshi’s prowess in Shinkage-ryū and Mutō-dori was known by Tokugawa Ieyasu, at that time still Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s loyal general. Ieyasu was highly interested in the martial arts, and he arranged for a meeting with Munetoshi at Takagamine, north of Kyoto. Munetoshi brought his fifth son, Munenori, with him to demonstrate. After explaining the philosophy of Shinkage-ryū, they demonstrated some of the kata of the ryū, as well as Mutō-dori. However, Ieyasu wished to see for himself, so he took up a "bokutō", a wooden sword, and requested that Munetoshi demonstrate Mutō-dori on him. Munetoshi successfully did so, sending Ieyasu’s bokutō flying away and knocking Ieyasu onto his back. Impressed, Ieyasu asked Munetoshi to teach him Shinkage-ryū. Munetoshi refused, citing his advanced age, and recommended his son Munenori. Ieyasu agreed, and signed an oath to learn Shinkage-ryū, and to treat the Yagyū with favor. Munenori went with Ieyasu, and was given the post of hatamoto, or standard bearer.
That same year, a census of the Yamato Province revealed hidden, non-taxed rice fields in Yagyū Village. As punishment, Munetoshi’s lands were taken away by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Munetoshi continued to teach Shinkage-ryū, in particular to his grandson Hyōgonosuke Toshitoshi, and Takeda Ujikatsu, the head of the Konparu-ryū school of Noh theater.
Final years and death.
The Yagyū family suffered a major loss in 1597, when Munetoshi’s oldest grandson and ostensible heir, Sumitoshi, was killed in battle in Korea. In 1599, Munetoshi wrote out a will. Demonstrating the dire situation his family was in, he ordered that his tea ceremony equipment be sold to pay for his funeral. But Munetoshi would live to see a final reversal of fortune, and his long dedication to Shinkage-ryū finally secure the success of his family for generations. In 1600, the armies of Ishida Mitsunari and Tokugawa Ieyasu began moving against each other to determine who would rule after the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Ieyasu was attempting to put down an uprising by the Uesugi clan in Shimotsuke Province (present-day Tochigi Prefecture) when he learned that Mitsunari was moving against him. He dispatched Munenori back to Yagyū Village, to ask his father to raise forces in the Yamato region. At the age of 71, Munetoshi was too old to lead the forces himself, so Munenori led them to Ieyasu’s position, arriving a day before the battle. Ieyasu’s army carried the day, and among the rewards given to the Yagyū was the return of their ancestral lands to their control.
Munetoshi’s fourth son, Gorōemon Muneaki, had served under Kobayakawa Hideaki until Hideaki’s death in 1602. Muneaki became a "rōnin", and was taken in by Yokota Muraaki, the chamberlain of Nakamura Kazutada, lord of Yonago. In 1603, Nakamura killed Yokota, believing that the chamberlain was plotting against him. Yokota’s family, including Yagyū Muneaki, started an uprising, which was ruthlessly put down. Muneaki fought bravely, reportedly cutting down 18 men before he was shot and killed. He was 35 years old.
In 1604, Munetoshi’s grandson, Toshitoshi, left Yagyū Village to serve the great general Kato Kiyomasa. Toshitoshi was in Kiyomasa’s service only a year before trouble with older retainers forced him to leave. Toshitoshi used the opportunity to do "musha shugyō", testing himself against and learning from different teachers. In 1606, Munetoshi urgently summoned Toshitoshi back to Yagyū Village. When Toshitoshi returned, Munetoshi, now in ill health, bequeathed to his grandson all of his Shinkage-ryū materials, including the license of transmission and illustrated scrolls he received from Hidetsuna. In 1606, Yagyū Sekishūsai Taira-no-Munetoshi died at age 78 in Yagyū Village.
Legacy.
After his death, his son Munenori took possession of the family lands in Yagyū Village, and ordered that Hōtokuji Temple be built in Munetoshi’s honor. Munenori’s son Retsudō was made the chief priest. The temple remains today, on the grounds where Munetoshi’s manor once stood.
With the patronage of the Tokugawa family, the Yagyū family was finally secure, enjoying peace and prosperity until the end of the Tokugawa era. Munenori, initially only a hatamoto and sword instructor, became a trusted aide to the third Tokugawa Shōgun, Iemitsu. Yagyū Village and the surrounding area became Yagyū-han, with Munenori as its first lord. Munenori and his son Jūbei were known for their skill with the sword, and they had a number of students, some of who would go on to found their own styles. Munenori’s line is known as the Edo Yagyū.
Munetoshi’s oldest son, Toshikatsu, remained in Yagyū Village until his death, his disability preventing him from being employed by a lord. But his sons would go on to become renowned sword instructors in their own right. His youngest, Kenzaemon, became the sword instructor to Date Masumune, the lord of Sendai-han. Toshikatsu’s second son, Toshitoshi, eventually became the sword instructor to the Owari Tokugawa, in Nagoya. Toshitoshi’s line, the Owari Yagyū, continued to teach and pass down Shinkage-ryū throughout the Edo Period, to the present day. The current sōke, Yagyū Kōichi, is a direct 13th generation descendant of Munetoshi via Toshitoshi’s line.
Name.
Munetoshi is often referred to in popular works as “Muneyoshi”, and likewise his grandsons Jūbei and Hyōgonosuke are referred to as Mitsuyoshi and Toshiyoshi, respectively. However, in the Yagyū family, they are known as Munetoshi, Mitsutoshi, and Toshitoshi. The character 厳 has been passed down in the family since Ietoshi’s time, always with the reading “toshi”. In the Edo Yagyū line of Munenori, only Jūbei Mitsutoshi was given the 厳 character, but from the 5th head of the family on, the character 俊 was used, also read “toshi”.
When historians first came across the name 宗厳 they had no way to be sure how the name was read. The only suggestion for pronunciation in Yagyū family records was "Songon", the Chinese-reading of the characters, which Munetoshi took upon taking the name “Sekishūsai”. One late 18th century record of family lineages, the "Kansei Choshu Shokafu", noted “Muneyoshi” as the pronunciation. In the Daikanwa Jiten, the largest Chinese character dictionary for the Japanese language, 厳 is given "kane", "tsuyo", and "yoshi" as possible readings used in names. So in early modern histories, this reading was used. Some books still use it today. However, historian Imamura Yoshio posits that even the kana characters indicating the "Muneyoshi" pronunciation in the "Kansei Choshu Shokafu" may actually be indicating "Munetoshi". The kana よ (yo) was derived from 与, which also can be read as "to". Starting with the release of "Shōden Shinkage-ryū", by Yagyū Toshinaga, in 1955, the Yagyū family pronunciation has become more common than before.
Fiction and Legend.
Like many other great figures in Japanese history, Munetoshi has become a popular figure in literature, movies, video games and other media, and has accumulated a number of exaggerated tales and legends about him. In Yagyū Village, near the Yagyū family burial ground, is a large rock called Itto-seki, which has been split in half. Though it was most probably split by lightning or earthquake, legend says that Munetoshi cleaved it himself with his sword.
Munetoshi is a prominent character in Eiji Yoshikawa's "Musashi", a fictionalized telling of the life of Miyamoto Musashi. In that story a young and still wild Musashi seeks out Munetoshi, seeking to make a name for himself by defeating the famous swordsman. By that time however, Munetoshi is already old and ailing, and instead of dueling, the encounter turns into a learning experience for Musashi, who is awed by the spiritual power of Munetoshi, and makes him aware of his shortcomings as a person. These encounters are also portrayed in the manga series "Vagabond", based on Yoshikawa's novel.
In the Onimusha video game series, Munetoshi, by taking the title of Jubei, was the main character in Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny. After Nobunaga destroys the Yagyū Village, Jubei goes off on a journey to avenge them. He also appears in Onimusha Blade Warriors and is in hiding in Onimusha 3: Demon Siege. In Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, he retires and gives the Jubei name to his granddaughter, Akane. He is referred to Sekishusai as a result. His son, Yagyū Munenori became a servant of the evil Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and for this, he sent Akane to kill him.
In the "Fatal Fury" video game series, the character Jubei Yamada is based on him.

The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)

The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (1599–1600) is a painting by the Italian master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. It is located in the Contarelli Chapel of the church of the French congregation San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, where it hangs opposite "The Calling of Saint Matthew "and beside the altarpiece "The Inspiration of Saint Matthew", both by Caravaggio. It was the first of the three to be installed in the chapel, in July 1600. 
The painting shows the martyrdom of Saint Matthew the Evangelist, author of the Gospel of Matthew. According to tradition, the saint was killed on the orders of the king of Ethiopia while celebrating Mass at the altar. The king lusted after his own niece, and had been rebuked by Matthew, for the girl was a nun, and therefore the bride of Christ. Cardinal Contarelli, who had died several decades earlier, had laid down very explicitly what was to be shown: the saint being murdered by a soldier sent by the wicked king, some suitable architecture, and crowds of onlookers showing appropriate emotion. (See the article on the Contarelli Chapel). 
The commission (which, strictly speaking, was from his patron, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, rather than from the church itself), caused Caravaggio considerable difficulty, as he had never painted so large a canvas, nor one with so many figures. X-rays reveal two separate attempts at the composition before the one we see today, with a general movement towards simplification through reduction in the number of figures, and reduction – ultimately elimination – of the architectural element. 
The first version revealed by the x-rays is in the Mannerist style of the most admired artist in Rome at the time, Giuseppe Cesari, with a crowd of small figures amidst massive architecture. It must have seemed static and distanced. The second version turned to Raphael for a model, adding a crowd of onlookers displaying fear and pity, including a woman who presumably represented the nun. This was in line with the crowded scene requested by Cardinal Contarelli and with the tenets of Mannerism, which demanded bodies and buildings defined by perspective and drawing, but Caravaggio had already developed a personal style in which bodies were defined by light and darkness and in which backgrounds were eliminated. 
At this point Caravaggio left off the "Martydom" and turned his attention to the companion piece, the "Calling". This drew on his own earlier genre-pieces, "Cardsharps" and "The Fortune Teller", but writ large. Apparently re-inspired, or perhaps with renewed self-confidence, Caravaggio turned back to the "Martydom", but this time working in his own idiom. The third version dropped the architecture, reduced the number of actors, and moved the action closer to the viewer; more than this, it introduced the dramatic chiaroscuro which picks out the most important elements of the subject, in much the same way a spotlight picks out the action on a stage, but centuries before spotlights were imagined, and chose to represent the moment of greatest drama, as the murderer is about to plunge his sword into the fallen saint. This is the version we see today, the action caught at the moment of highest drama, the bystanders reduced to supporting roles by the sharply selective light, the whole giving the impression of a moment seen as if in a lightning flash. 
This painting marks the moment when the Mannerist orthodoxy of the late 16th century – rational, intellectual, perhaps a little artificial – gives way to the Baroque. It caused a sensation. Federico Zuccari, one of the most eminent painters in Rome and a champion of Mannerism, came to see, and sniffed that it was nothing. But the younger artists were totally won over, and Caravaggio became suddenly the most famous artist in Rome.
It takes concentration to understand that the confused melee is a victory of sainthood. Saint Matthew appears to recoil as he falls before the naked fury of his executioner, burning in the glare of light, who readies his sword to strike. Around the saint are persons showing varied emotions, as required by Contarelli: terror, awe, and consternation, while an angel holds out the palm of martyrdom. Confusion about the image can be alleviated by understanding that Matthew is not quailing in fear at the executioner's strike, instead he reaches for the angel's gift. The executioner's grasp and the angel's reach are two parallel paths. Only Matthew is privy to the angelic visitation. Viewed as such, this is a painting not about a moment of general terror, but the death of a saint as the personal handshake of the divine. Italian Baroque painting and sculpture of the time commonly depicted martyrdoms not as moments of fear, but as moments of joy or ecstasy, as in for example, Bernini's Santa Bibiana.
One factor worth noting is that Caravaggio, unlike his Mannerist predecessors, has actually made a simple fact of early modern church architecture work in his favour: large cathedrals like Saint Peter's might be well lit, but small chapels like the Contarelli were not. They were, and are, dark and narrow. As Caravaggio's biographer Peter Robb puts it: "Anyone coming down the nave of San Luigi (the church which contains the chapel) would've seen the pale killer nudes looming out of the dark from a distance, in a space that seemed to open out of the wall into the church's real transept."
That said, the painting contains many references from Michelangelo, Raphael and others, which critic John Gash ascribes not so much to a need to find appropriate poses as to a desire for "a quality of monumental grandeur akin to that of the High Renaissance." The figures of the saint and the horror-struck boy on the left, for example, are borrowed "to the extent of almost 'quoting' directly" from Titian's altarpiece of "The Martyrdom of St Peter the Martyr" in Venice.
The figure in the background, about left-centre and behind the assassin, is a self-portrait by Caravaggio.

Cris Williamson

Cris Williamson is an American feminist singer-songwriter, who achieved fame as a recording artist, and who was a pioneer as a visible lesbian political activist, during a time when few who were not connected to the Lesbian community were aware of Gay and Lesbian issues. Williamson's music and insight has served as a catalyst for change in the creation of women-owned record companies in the 1970s. Using her musical talents, networking with other lesbian artists of musical quality, and her willingness to represent those who did not yet feel safe in speaking for themselves, Williamson is remembered by many in the LGBT community for her contributions, both artistically, and politically, and continues to be a role model for a younger generation hoping to address concerns and obtain recognition for achievements specific to people who have historically been ignored.
Biography.
Early years.
Williamson was born in 1947 in Deadwood, South Dakota, although her family moved to Colorado and Wyoming when she was still young. Her musical idol at the time was Judy Collins, and Williamson developed a musical style and sound that was similar to that of Collins. She released her first album, "The Artistry of Cris Williamson" in 1964, when she was sixteen. She became a local musical sensation in Sheridan, Wyoming, releasing two following LPs afterward. Williamson graduated from the University of Denver. She supported herself initially as a schoolteacher, however, during the same time, collaborated with other women who were also singer-songwriters and performing artists, and began to network with Holly Near, Meg Christian, and Margie Adam; all musicians who became women artists of stature, forming an entirely new genre of music, primarily about and for women.
Career.
Olivia Records.
During a radio interview in Washington, D.C. in 1973, Williamson suggested that a record label aimed at gay women would be a good idea. The independent label Olivia Records was founded the next day. Olivia Records released Williamson's "The Changer and the Changed" (1975), which became one of the best-selling independent releases of all time. 
Williamson went on to record more than a dozen more albums with Olivia Records, then after its demise formed her own label, Wolf Moon Records. This helped to set the pace for other recording artists who found it difficult to work with the major record labels.
In 1982, she collaborated with Estonian artist/author Viido Polikarpus on a science fiction/fantasy fable lp and book (with Polikarpos' art work) entitled "Lumiere" and released on Pacific Cascade Records.
Personal life.
Williamson recorded two albums with her long-time producer and lover, Tret Fure. Williamson and Fure ended their 20-year relationship in 2000, and each now records as a solo artist.
Williamson has worked as a session musician both to support herself and to lend assistance to other fellow artists. She has collaborated with other women's music artists, including Meg Christian and Teresa Trull. She has friends in many corners; one longtime friend is musician Bonnie Raitt, who has played on some of her albums.
Political activism and charity work.
Williamson has been a lesbian feminist and a promoter of women owned music companies. She has recently become involved in a new project with Bonnie Raitt.

Lucybell

Lucybell is a Chilean rock band formed by four students from the Universidad de Chile's Faculty of Art in 1991, in Santiago de Chile. The original four members were: 
Marcelo Muñoz and Gabriel Vigliesoni left the band shortly before the recording of the album "Amanece" in early 2000. Eduardo Caces (bass) joined shortly after, becoming a permanent member of the band ever since. Francisco Gonzalez then left in 2005, leading to the immediate arrival of Cote Foncea (drums), of the now defunct Chilean rock band Dracma. 
In the wake of these inner turmoils, the band managed to issue their fifth studio album
"Lúmina", which displayed the new direction the band was taking - a rawer guitar-driven sound, moving away from the previous programmed and synth-friendly tunes. A year earlier the EP "Sálvame la Vida" was the prelude to this evolution, it included the first "Lúmina" single along with some cover songs released in tribute albums and a contribution to a movie soundtrack. The group, currently composed of Valenzuela, Caces and Foncea, recently signed with Warner Mexico and released their most recent work, "Comiendo Fuego". At the end of the year 2007, the band recorded by their own means the EP "Primitivo", following the "do it yourself" indie music aesthetics.

The Fuzztones

The Fuzztones are a garage rock revival band formed in 1980. Founded by singer-guitarist Rudi Protrudi in New York City, the band has gone through several member changes but is currently active in Europe. Dismissed by some critics and listeners as a "bar band" or unoriginal, they maintained a strong fan base in New York, in Europe (with their music being played on Hungarian State Radio), and in Los Angeles. Rudi Protrudi moved to Los Angeles in 1987, after the breakup of the original band, to organize a new Fuzztones, consisting of Jordan Tarlow, (Lead Guitar) John "Speediejohn" Carlucci, (Bass) Jason Savall, (Vox Organ) & "Mad" Mike Czekaj on drum. This lineup bears the distinction of being the only 1980's garage rock revival band to secure a major label record deal, when they signed to RCA.
The group's name is derived from "Fuzz Tone", the commercial name of a guitar effect pedal invented in 1962 and whose distinctive sound was popularized in the 1965 hit song "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones.

Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation

The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) is a charitable organization dedicated to multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer, which afflicts over fifty thousand Americans each year. Most medical charities focus on increasing public awareness and on raising money to distribute to researchers, in the hope that some of the work will lead to a new drug or a cure; but the MMRF runs as if it were a for-profit business, expecting high returns from the money the organization raises from donors.
History.
MMRF was founded in 1998 by twin sisters Kathy Giusti and Karen Andrews, following Kathy's diagnosis with multiple myeloma. Giusti, a pharmaceutical company executive and Harvard Business School Alum, wanted to encourage researchers to develop treatments for multiple myeloma by using business models rather than academic models of drug development.
About The MMRF.
Although some academic scientists think it's unrealistic for patients to think that they can "buy a cure," the MMRF has helped finance eight drugs now in Phase II trials, developed a tissue bank with 1,400 bone marrow samples, and raised $92.4 million since 1988.
MMRF is the number-one private funder of multiple myeloma research, having raised over $120 million since its inception to fund more than 120 laboratories worldwide. MMRF has developed a diverse research “portfolio” of programs to yield long-, mid-, and short-term returns on the MMRF’s research investment and deliver better treatments to patients faster: basic science programs to better understand the disease and identify new druggable targets through genomics and proteomics research; validation programs to prioritize new compounds and combinations based on key targets; and a network of leading myeloma centers who collaborate to conduct clinical trials to accelerate the development of novel treatments.
The work of the MMRF contributed to the FDA approval of six drugs for multiple myeloma. Introduction of these treatments has helped increased life expectancy in some patients from four years to nearly seven years and, because of their success in myeloma, these same drugs are now being explored as potential treatments for more than 20 other cancers and diseases. The MMRF is funding research into 30 compounds at the pre-clinical stage.
The MMRF directs 93 percent of funds raised to research and related programming. The MMRF received a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, an A+ from the American Institute of Philanthropy, and approval from the National Cancer Institute for its research grants program.

<doc id="2888794" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2888794" title="Lyme and cybelle">
Lyme and cybelle

lyme and cybelle was a short-lived male/female folk/pop duo formed by Warren Zevon and Violet Santangelo. The duo is best known for its moderate chart hit "Follow Me," which represented the first commercial recording of Zevon's long musical career.
Origins.
Zevon and Santangelo met in early 1964 while attending Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, California. The two became close platonic friends and quickly found they shared musical interests, singing songs by The Beatles. They soon formed a musical partnership. Zevon took the stage name of Stephen lyme, while Santangelo called herself cybelle, a name inspired by the 1962 French film "Sundays and Cybele". The pair fashioned their names in lower case in the style of American poet e.e. cummings.
On one occasion, the duo sang songs for a group of friends that included child actor Michael Burns, whose mother worked at White Whale Records. Through this connection, Zevon and Santangelo obtained a contract with White Whale to record a single as lyme and cybelle.
Early success and rapid decline.
Bones Howe produced their first single for White Whale, called "Follow Me." Howe, famed for his production work on hits by The Association and The 5th Dimension, later considered "Follow Me" to be the first psychedelic pop record. The single, backed with the lush ballad "Like The Seasons," reached number 65 on the "Billboard" pop charts in April 1966.
Rather than having the duo record an album to cash in on its success, White Whale opted to have Howe produce a second lyme and cybelle single. The resulting single, a cover of Bob Dylan's "If You Gotta Go, Go Now" backed with "I'll Go On," failed to make a dent in the charts. According to Santangelo, the single began selling well, only to have its momentum crushed when Bill Gavin, a powerful radio industry figure, claimed the song was sexually suggestive.
After the failure of their second single, Zevon left the duo. Several reasons have been given for why Zevon departed. Some accounts claim that Zevon became more uncompromising in his artistic vision. Santangelo claims that she walked away from Zevon because of his excessive drinking and drug use.
Zevon was replaced by a new "lyme," Monkees guitarist Wayne Erwin. The first and only single issued by the second version of lyme and cybelle was "Song 7," backed with "Write If You Get Work," both allegedly written by Erwin, although credited to "Joe Glenn." The single was produced by Curt Boettcher, who had just produced The Association's first album. This incarnation of lyme and cybelle lasted into 1967, when Erwin fired Santangelo.
After lyme and cybelle.
Following the demise of lyme and cybelle, Santangelo left the music business. Trying her hand at musical theater, she earned a talent scholarship at the University of Southern California. She became a successful Broadway actress under the stage name Laura Kenyon.
Zevon's subsequent demo recordings indicated an evolution toward incisive and darkly humorous lyrics and a rough sound far removed from the mellow vibe of lyme and cybelle. He scored a couple songwriting successes: "Outside Chance" was covered by The Turtles, while "He Quit Me" was included on the soundtrack from the 1969 drama film "Midnight Cowboy". Zevon's first solo album, "Wanted Dead or Alive", was released by Imperial Records in 1970. Although that album was not a commercial success, Zevon would eventually rise to fame with his classic albums "Warren Zevon" (1976) and "Excitable Boy" (1978).
The Turtles recorded a cover of lyme and cybelle's "Like The Seasons" as a B-side to their #1 hit from 1967, "Happy Together."
Re-release.
All six of the lyme and cybelle songs from their three singles were included on a compilation album entitled "Warren Zevon: The First Sessions", released by Varèse Sarabande in early 2003, shortly after Zevon was diagnosed with fatal mesothelioma. This compilation also included two previously unreleased lyme and cybelle recordings, "I've Just Seen A Face" by the Beatles and "Peeping And Hiding" by Jimmy Reed, plus a demo recording of "Follow Me." This album is currently out of print.

Post-Vulgate Cycle

__NOTOC__
The Post-Vulgate Cycle is one of the major Old French prose cycles of Arthurian literature. It is essentially a rehandling of the earlier Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), with much left out and much added, including characters and scenes from the Prose "Tristan".
The Post-Vulgate, written probably between 1230 and 1240, is an attempt to create greater unity in the material, and to de-emphasise the secular love affair between Lancelot and Guinevere in favor of the Quest for the Holy Grail. It omits almost all of the Vulgate's "Lancelot Proper" section, making it much shorter than its source, and directly condemns everything but the spiritual life. It does not survive complete, but has been reconstructed from French, Castilian Spanish, and Portuguese fragments.
This cycle of works was one of the most important sources of Thomas Malory's "Le Morte d'Arthur".
The work is divided into four sections. Many of these sections are largely similar to the previous Vulgate versions.

Sodastream (band)

Sodastream are an Australian folk rock duo consisting of Karl Smith on lead vocals and acoustic guitar; and Pete Cohen on double bass, bass guitar, piano and backing vocals; which formed in 1996 in Perth. They have toured Australia, United States, Europe and Japan and had national rotation on radio network, Triple J. Sodastream issued four studio albums, "Looks Like a Russian" (22 May 2000), "The Hill for Company" (3 September 2001), "A Minor Revival" (4 August 2003) and "Reservations" (22 May 2006) before disbanding in 2007. In 2011 the pair were both members of Lee Memorial and in 2013 reformed Sodastream.
History.
Sodastream began in Perth in 1996, as a pop music group consisting of Peter Ronald Cohen on double bass, bass guitar, piano and backing vocals; Adam Johnson on drums and percussion; and Karl Stephen Smith (ex-Thermos Cardy) on lead vocals and acoustic guitar. In 1997 they recorded and released their debut extended play, "Enjoy", on Aquamudvuv Records. The seven-track EP was produced by Anthony Frisina and Steve Elkin guested on piano for one track. Johnson left after the EP appeared but Cohen and Smith continued as a folk rock duo – without a regular drummer. Sarah Corbett of "Come with a Smile" described their work as "poignant words, elegant melodies, wavering voices, melancholy tones and understated instrumentation".
In late 1998 the pair relocated to Melbourne, where they recorded and released their second EP, "Practical Footwear". This seven-track EP was co-produced by Jason Brown and Sodastream, drums were supplied by Dave Bower. The band signed with a range of independent labels including Australia's Trifekta Records, United Kingdom's Tugboat Records and United States' Drive-In Records. The US version of "Practical Footwear" was trimmed back to six tracks, which Allmusic's Mike DaRonco described as "dreary but mature folk-pop anthems" with "othing uplifting or outgoing, but Sodastream's acoustic arrangements are pleasantly relaxing".
During March and April 1999 Sodastream undertook their first tour of Europe including shows in Netherlands and England. In October that year they returned to Netherlands to perform at the Crossing Border Festival. On 22 May 2000 Sodastream released their first album, "Looks Like a Russian", on Trifekta with Gavin Tempany, Laurie Sinagra and the group co-producing; drums were supplied by Marty Brown (later in Art of Fighting). Corbett at Oz Music Project's website praised Smith's "captivating vocals ... elicate, hushed and high pitched. Shy, sad and lonely" while Cohen provided a "calming atmosphere with spine-chilling strums from his double bass and haunting backing vocals". They toured Europe again and had their first shows in Australia outside Perth or Melbourne. Their material was broadcast by national radio network, Triple J.
On 3 September 2001 Sodastream released their second album, "The Hill for Company", produced again by Sinagra, Tempany and the duo; with drums by Brown. Oz Music Project's Victoria Hannan noted "the aching and longing of a voice can make your heart skip a beat, the way a simple melody intertwined with the melancholy of a throbbing double bass accompaniment can make you swoon". Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, explained why "The Hill for Company" was his Album of the Week, "Karl Smith and his intimate vocals and acoustic guitar, and Pete Cohen with his supportive double bass. On record they add gentle colours and guest musicians – viola, trumpet and trombone, even drums – adding sophistication to what sounds so simple and raw, but without breaking the mood, or overshadowing the central all-important atmosphere. Slowly as you listen, entranced by the mood, the songs begin to shine through". The group undertook two more Australian tours and another tour of Europe.
Further European tours followed in both 2002 and 2003 including a live performance on Italian MTV, two national tours of Australia and then the band's first tour of Japan. On 4 August 2003 their third album, "A Minor Revival", was issued. It was produced by Cohen and Smith with Brown (also on drums) and James Walker (aka Machine Translations) (also on lead guitar, slide guitar, keyboards and viola). Johnny Loftus of Allmusic found that the band "continues to fall comfortably in line with the indie twee establishment, it's also delivered another strong set of songs, this time around informed with plenty of hope". Liz Giuffre at Oz Music Project professed "stunning arrangements of guitar, double bass, viola, trumpet and percussion, [the album is sweet and seductive, a disk that swells and falls subtly under the tide of the pale male vocals".
From mid-March to early May 2004 Sodastream undertook their first US tour, with further tours of Europe (in May) and Australia (in August). In October of the following year they released another EP, "Take Me with You When You Go"; the seven tracks had been recorded from March to July by Cohen and Smith. Eliza Sarlos at "Mess+Noise" enthused "at once calming and intriguing, where the interplay between acoustic guitar, double bass and voice is immediately affecting ... they've still got the songs, the killer songs ... have taken more risks, and in terms of expression ... narratives flourish with a development in both structure and music".
On 22 May 2006 they released their fourth studio album, "Reservations", with Cohen and Smith producing. Drowned in Sound's Daniel Ross opined that the group had a "disgustingly brilliant knack of being able to make one simultaneously envious of their craft and sickened that they don't do more with it ... although rather obvious in their execution and the buttons they press, can construct images of the poor, broken sod we probably all are anyway and chillingly shove it in your face under a blanket of sweetness". The album was supported by another European tour. In January 2007 the album was one of 25 finalists for the Australian Music Prize.
On 18 February 2007 the band announced their break-up, with their final show at Melbourne's East Brunswick Club on 2 March. An email from the band's website explained "ur reasons are complex and many, but above all, it is out of respect to the music that we make that we have decided not to force a situation that could potentially damage our many happy memories of the journey thus far". According to Smith "we did "Reservations" and followed it up with a few big tours and then kind of fell in a heap, and that was it".
After disbandment Cohen was a member of the bands, Khancoban and then Luluc. From 2008 Smith fronted Lee Memorial, which issued an album, "The Lives of Lee Memorial", in September 2009. It was recorded over the previous year with Tom Lyngcoln (also in The Nation Blue) on guitar and Matt Bailey (ex-The Paradise Motel, Small Sips) on bass guitar. Back in 2006, Smith had guested on Small Sips' alternative country music album, "The Morning Ripples". In 2011 Cohen rejoined with Smith in Lee Memorial. In January 2013, Sodastream announced their reformation, including performances in March and a proposed album of previously unreleased work and new material.

Hugo Race

Hugo Justin Race (born c. 1961) is an Australian rock musician and record producer who had been based in Europe from 1989 to 2011. He was a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (1983–85), and The Wreckery (1984–89) with Nick Barker and Robin Casinader. As from October 2013 he was simultaneously a member of Hugo Race and the True Spirit, Hugo Race Fatalists, and Dirtmusic. True Spirit have released 12 albums. Race returned to live Australia in 2011.
Biography.
Hugo Justin Race was born in the early 1960s in Melbourne and grew up in an Anglo-Irish family. His father listened to musical theatre and classical music, his mother played piano, he has brothers and a sister. In 1978 he formed Dum Dum Fit as the lead vocalist and guitarist with Robin Casinader on keyboards. Two years later Race and Casinader formed Plays with Marionettes which also included Edward Clayton-Jones on guitar, organ, and vocals (ex-The Fabulous Marquises) and Nick Seymour on bass guitar.
Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described their sound as "aggravating style of jazzy no-wave noise", although they developed a local following on the "inner-city/Crystal Ballroom circuit". In 1982 they issued a shared single with their track, "Witchen Kopf", backed by a track from the group, People with Chairs up Their Noses. Another track, "Hellbelly", appeared on a various artists album, "This Is Hot", in 1984. It was co-written by Race and Casinader, however by February 1984 the band had separated.
Late in 1983 Race on guitar joined Nick Cave on lead vocals (ex-The Birthday Party) in his new band, Nick Cave: Man or Myth?. By mid-1984 Cave's backing band were renamed The Bad Seeds and had issued their debut album, "From Her to Eternity". The title track was co-written by Race and Cave with fellow band mates Barry Adamson, Blixa Bargeld, Mick Harvey, and Anita Lane. The group toured the United States, United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, during the European leg Clayton-Jones joined The Bad Seeds temporarily replacing Bargeld.
Late that year Race and Clayton-Jones returned to Melbourne to form The Wreckery, as a blues, rock band. By January 1985 the line up included Race, Casinder (also on drums), and Clayton-Jones with Tadeusz O'Biegly on bass guitar; and Charles Todd on saxophone and organ (ex-Wild Dog Rodeo, Cattletruck). McFarlane described the group as "inner-city angst kings proffered a lurching brand of gutbucket St Kilda blues by way of the Mississippi delta. It was a fiery sound totally unique in Australia at the time". Race was described as "enigmatic, petulant ... whose bleak visions stabbed at the heart of the human condition".
The group recorded their debut five-track extended play, "I Think this Town is Nervous", which was issued by Hot Records in December 1985. By that time O'Biegly had been replaced by Nick Barker on bass guitar (ex-Curse, Reptile Smile). Race wrote the majority of the group's material. They issued two studio albums, "Here at Pains Insistence" (August 1987) and "Laying Down Law" (October 1988), before they disbanded by mid-1989.
While a member of The Wreckery, in 1987, Race co-wrote the screen play for "Ghosts… of the Civil Dead" (December 1988), a feature film directed by John Hillcoat, which starred Cave and Dave Mason (of The Reels) in their debut acting roles. Back in 1986 Race had a minor role, Pierre, in "Dogs in Space", which was directed by Richard Lowenstein and starred Michael Hutchence and Saskia Post. In 1988 Race had his own starring role as the titular character of "Mack the Knife" who is a "sociopath"; the film was released as "In Too Deep" (1989). "The Canberra Times" reviewer described Race's character as "a drifting crim plotting the next route to easy money" but felt that the film "degenerates into a collection of characters in search of an ending".
Also during 1987 Race, Barker and Casinader recorded as The True Spirit with guest musicians Brian Colechin on bass guitar, John Murphy on percussion, and Chris Wilson on harmonica. A track, "Certified Fool", appeared on a various artists' album, "Melbourne Stuff". The same recording sessions resulted in the debut album by Hugo Race & The True Spirit, "Rue Morgue Blues", which appeared in June 1988 on the Rampant Records (for Australian market) and Normal Records (for German market). The album was engineered by John Phillips (of not drowning, waving) and produced by Race.
Late in 1989 Race relocated to Europe, initially to London then living in Berlin, Germany. In 1990 he issued "Earls World" under the moniker, The True Spirit. He was joined in the studio by Alex Hacke on guitar and slide guitar (of Einstürzende Neubauten); Chris Hughes on tabla (of Slub); John Molineux on harmonica; Rainer Lingk on banjo, guitar and bass guitar; and Thomas Wydler on drums (both of Die Haut). Race used a similar line up to record his next album, "Second Revelator" (1991), with additional work by former band mate Harvey (of The Bad Seeds) on piano, organ, bass guitar, backing vocals, percussion and as producer.
To promote the album Race used The True Spirit line up of Casinader, Clayton-Jones, Colechin and Hughes (now on drums). They toured Australia in December 1991 and released the album there in January the next year on Survival Records. They toured Australia again in February 1993 and followed with another album, "Spiritual Thirst". With Race in the studio were Colechin, Hughes, Molineux and Ralf Droge on trombone and keyboards; Race also produced the album.
In 1995 the group released "Valley of Light" on the German label, Glitterhouse and, in February the next year, on the Australian label, Roadshow Music. It included a cover version of Captain Beefheart's "Clear Spot". The album was co-produced by Race with Tony Cohen. The next album, "Wet Dream", which appeared in June 1997, was described as "industrial-trance-blues", by UK magazine, "Melody Maker". By 1998 Race was living in Italy, he toured Australia first as a solo artist and then at the end of the year with The True Spirit.
In 1999 Race set up his own production base, Helixed, which incorporated diverse side-projects including the Italian-based Sepiatone, an "atmospheric electronic/acoustic project" with Marta Collica (ex-Mice Vice); the Zurich-based, Transfargo (RecRec Music, Switzerland) with Dimitri de Perrot which issued an album, "Mil Transit" (2003); and a Sicilian-based multimedia project, Merola Matrix (Desvelos Records, Sardinia). He has also produced Italian artists such as Cesare Basile and Nove Rose. In January 2000 he worked with Australian singer, Mia Stone (ex-Stone Circus, Satellite) and her group, Michaela.
In 2001 Race issued a compilation 2× CD album, "Long Time Ago", which contained material by The True Spirit from 1988 to 1999. He had a minor role as the Vampire Bass Player in Michael Rymer's film, "Queen of the Damned" (February 2002). In 2007 he joined Chris Brokaw (ex-Codeine) and Chris Eckman to issue the album, "Dirtmusic". In 2010 he formed Hugo Race Fatalists with Antonio Gramentieri and Diego Sapignoli from the Italian instrumental band, Sacri Cuori. They released two albums: "Fatalists" (Interbang/Gusstaff, 2010) and "We Never Had Control" (Interbang/Gusstaff, 2012). In 2011 he returned to live in Australia. As from October 2013 Race was simultaneously a member of Hugo Race and the True Spirit, Hugo Race Fatalists, and Dirtmusic.

Kathy Giusti (born 1958) is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) and the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium (MMRC). In 1995, following her diagnosis with multiple myeloma (MM) at the age of 37, Giusti discovered that there was no research at all going on to create drugs for MM. Together with her twin sister, she founded the MMRF to fund innovative myeloma research and drug discovery. Having raised more than $225 million to date, the MMRF is the world's number one funder of myeloma research. Its work has resulted in approval of four new drugs to treat the disease.
Giusti received her MBA in general management from Harvard Business School and graduated from the University of Vermont magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences. She began her career in 1980 with Merck & Co., and later joined the Gillette Company. In 1993, she joined G.D. Searle & Co., where she last served as Executive Director of Searle's worldwide arthritis franchise. She used her business background to run the MMRF like a business rather than a traditional medical charity; she employs full-time scientists to track MM research around the world and sets strict timelines and goals for researchers who receive foundation grants.

Satoshi Tomiie

Satoshi Tomiie (born November 22, 1966) is a Japanese house music producer and DJ. Since the late 1980s he has been at the forefront of the global house music movement thanks to his popular dancefloor anthems, pop remixes, and DJ sets.
History.
A lifelong student of jazz and classical piano, Satoshi had an influential impact from his very first record. His debut single ‘Tears’, which he co-produced in 1989 with Chicago’s ‘Godfather of house’ Frankie Knuckles, was an instant club hit and is today considered one of house music’s most important moments. 
In the early 1990s, he toured and played keyboard for Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto (of Yellow Magic Orchestra fame). His reputation for crafting meticulous club rhythms led to him remixing some of pop’s biggest names including U2, Mariah Carey, Photek, Simply Red and David Bowie.
At the turn of the millennium in a reinvention move typical of his DJ career, Satoshi introduced a groundbreaking new club sound via 2000’s ‘Full Lick’ album. The long-player featured dark twisted electronic rhythms, haunting vocals, and hypnotic grooves that came to set the benchmark for a new developing house scene. The album’s hit single ‘Love In Traffic’ became a worldwide underground hit.
Another source of house music renovation, Satoshi and Hector Romero’s record label SAW Recordings has continued to refine the Chicago and New York City house blueprint over the last 10 years. A fine supporter of new producers, SAW most recently has championed a new generation of European-based house talent including Audiofly, Doomwork, Mabaan Soul, Tuccill, and Guti.
In 2012, after a two-year absence from music production, Tomiie returned with a new deeper, housier DJ sound, new singles and remixes.

Keiiti Aki

Aki was born in Yokohama, Japan. He received his bachelors degree in 1952 and doctoral degree in 1958, both from the University of Tokyo. Until 1960, he conducted research at that university's Earthquake Research Institute. He then did post-doctoral research at the Caltech Seismological Laboratory, where he worked with Frank Press.
Press invited Aki to join him at MIT in 1966. This second visit to the United States coincided with the 1966 Parkfield earthquake, noteworthy for its so-called coda waves, reverberations of seismic energy due to multiple scattering from subsurface inhomogeneities. Aki “developed a passion for using those waves to investigate Earth,” according to Bill Ellsworth, Aki's former student who was later head of the USGS seismology group. “He came from Japan as a statistically oriented seismologist, but he was not afraid to transform himself.”
Aki was very active in his field and was the president or chair of many organizations. He was the president of Seismological Section of the AGU, president of the Seismological Society of America, and Chair of the NAS Committee on Seismology. He was instrumental in the creation of the Southern California Earthquake Center, headquartered at the University of Southern California, in 1991, he having moved to USC from MIT in 1984.
In 1995, Aki moved to the seismically active island Réunion, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, where he continued to work until his death there in 2005. He left behind two sons (Shota and Zenta) and two daughters (Kajika and Uka).

Rasmus B. Anderson

Rasmus Bjørn Anderson (January 12, 1846 – March 2, 1936) was an American author, professor, and diplomat. He brought to popular attention the idea that Viking explorers discovered the New World and was the originator of Leif Erikson Day.
Biography.
Anderson was born in Albion in Dane County, Wisconsin to parents who were immigrants from Sandeid/Vikedal city Stavanger in the county of Rogaland, Norway. His parents were part of a small band of Quaker sympathizers who organized the first Norwegian emigration to America in the early 1820s. Anderson was a graduate of Luther College and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He was a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1867-1883. While there, he was the founding head of the Department of Scandinavian Studies, the oldest such department in an American university.
Rasmus B. Anderson founded a publication company, The Norrœna Society, which focused on republishing translations of texts devoted to "the History and Romance of Northern Europe". Anderson was the author of a number of books with Scandinavian themes. He also did a series of translations from Scandinavian languages, most notably the writings of Norwegian novelist Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. From 1885 to 1889, Anderson served as the United States Ambassador to Denmark. After his return to the U.S. in 1889, he was editor (1898–1922) of the Norwegian language weekly, "Amerika".
Anderson's book "America Not Discovered by Columbus " helped popularize the now familiar idea that Vikings were the first Europeans in the New World. Anderson was the originator of the movement to honor Leif Erikson with a holiday in the United States. Through efforts he started and led, Leif Erikson Day became an official observance in his native Wisconsin and other U. S. states. Decades after Anderson's death, it first became a federal observance by Presidential proclamation in 1964.

Training Support Center Hampton Roads

Training Support Center Hampton Roads is the current name of the facility in Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA, which was long-known as "FTC Dam Neck". It is the home of the "Fleet Combat Training Center Atlantic" of the United States Navy.
History.
Dam Neck Mills, U.S. Lifesaving Service.
TSC Hampton Roads is located near the former town of Dam Neck Mills which was located in Princess Anne County (the former county is now part of the independent city of Virginia Beach). It was the site of the 19th century Dam Neck Mills Lifesaving Station of the United States Lifesaving Service, one of five spaced at intervals along the coast in Virginia from Cape Henry south to the border of North Carolina. The U.S. Lifesaving Service merged with other agencies to form the United States Coast Guard in 1915.
The area's lifesaving history along the coast line of the Graveyard of the Atlantic is commemorated at the Old Coast Guard Station Museum located in the 1903 Seatack Lifesaving Service Station (the next one north of the Dam Neck Mills station) at 24th street adjacent to the boardwalk of Virginia Beach. The Old Coast Guard Station Museum has artifacts from the 1891 shipwreck of the "Dictator", displays of period lifesaving equipment, educational programs, and even an online "Tower Cam", offering Internet users a similar view to those of members of the Lifesaving crews had over 100 years ago.
World War II, FTC Dam Neck.
The United States Navy acquired the property during World War II to train anti-aircraft gunners. Since that time the mission was expanded to include training of Combat Systems operators and maintenance technicians. One notable former tenant command was Naval Guided Missile School (NAVGMSCOL), which provided training for the Polaris, Poseidon, and Trident 1 Backfit submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) systems and various surface missile systems.
Current mission.
In 2004, FTC Dam Neck was reorganized and renamed Training Support Center Hampton Roads, to align it with the U.S. Navy's "Revolution In Training". The actual training activity is the Center for Surface Combat Systems, which is headquartered in Dahlgren, Virginia. TSC Hampton Roads supports the training mission, as its name suggests.
Tenant commands.
Other tenant commands currently at Dam Neck include the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), Tactical Training Group Atlantic, and Combat Direction System Activity (CDSA) Dam Neck. TSC Hampton Roads is also home to the Navy and Marine Corps Intelligence Training Center, which trains Marines and sailors in military intelligence.
Nearby, Dam Neck Annex is part of Naval Air Station Oceana.

Life or Something Like It

Life or Something Like It is a 2002 romantic comedy/drama film directed by Stephen Herek. The film focuses on television reporter Lanie Kerrigan (Angelina Jolie) and her quest to find meaning in her life. The original music score was composed by David Newman. The film's taglines are: "Destiny is what you make of it" and "What if you only had 7 days to live?"
Plot.
Lanie Kerrigan (Angelina Jolie), a successful reporter for a Seattle television station interviews a self-proclaimed prophet, Jack (Tony Shalhoub), to find out if he really can predict football scores. Instead, Prophet Jack not only predicts the football score, and that it would hail the next day, but also that she would die in seven days, meaning the following Thursday. When his first two prophecies turn out to be correct, Kerrigan panics and again meets with Jack, asking him for another prophecy so that she can prove it wrong, which would imply uncertainty of her death. Jack tells her that there will be a relatively significant earthquake in San Francisco at 9:06 am; she hopes that it will be wrong but again it also becomes reality. Now Lanie becomes sure of her upcoming death and is forced to reevaluate her life. 
The remainder of the storyline, which runs for the week of the prophecy, revolves around her attempts at introspection. She seeks consolation in her famous baseball player boyfriend Cal Cooper (Christian Kane), and in her family, but finds little there. Her lifelong ambition, that of appearing on network television, begins to look like a distant dream. In her desperation, she commits professional blunders, but ends up finding support in an unlikely source: her archenemy, the cameraman Pete Scanlon (Edward Burns), with whom she once had casual sex; he introduces her to a new approach to life. Pete tells her to live every moment of her life and to do whatever she always wanted to do. Lanie implements Pete's advice; she moves in with Pete for a day, he introduces her to his son Tommy (Jesse James Rutherford) who lives with his mother who had separated with Pete, and they spend a whole day together with Tommy; that night they sleep together for the second time. The next day Lanie receives an opportunity for a job she always dreamed of in New York; she asks Pete to come with her, but he declines and tells her that her appetite for success and fame will never end. Lanie sadly leaves for New York.
Pete meets Jack and tells him how wrong he is, as Lanie got the job which Jack foretold she would not get. But Jack explains that he was right as Lanie will never be able to get the job as she'll die before it begins; he again gives a prophecy of a death of a famous former baseball player in a plane crash. Pete receives the news of the death of the baseball player as foretold by Jack, and tries to call Lanie to warn her. When he cannot reach her, he also flies to New York. Lanie, unconcerned with Jack's prophecy, interviews her idol, famous media personality Deborah Connors (Stockard Channing), which receives huge television ratings. Lanie is offered a better opportunity but she declines as now she knows what is worthwhile in her life—she goes to Pete in Seattle. Outside in the street a police officer gets into a conflict with a man, who shoots a bullet into the air. Pete tries to warn Lanie across the street, but she is shot in the crossfire. Luckily, Lanie survives, and Pete tells her in the hospital that he has loved her since the first time he saw her; Lanie says she loves him, too. Later, Pete, Lanie and Tommy watch Cal's baseball game, where Lanie (in a voiceover) says that one part of her has died—the part which didn't know how to live a life.
KOMO-TV.
The majority of the movie was shot on location in Seattle, Washington although portions were filmed in downtown Vancouver. The TV station in the movie, KQMO, was actually real-life Seattle TV station KOMO-TV (the KOMO logo was altered on the set of KOMO 4 News and on several of KOMO's news vehicles, in addition to a few mic flags). 
Several KOMO personalities make cameo appearances; among them are longtime anchors Dan Lewis and Margo Myers (the latter moved to KIRO-TV in January 2005), weather anchor and "Front Runners" host Steve Pool, and weekend weather anchor Theron Zahn. Other KOMO personalities who made brief cameo appearances include People Helper John Sharify, and reporter Michelle Esteban.
Additionally, Vancouver news anchors Pamela Martin and Jill Krop, at the time both employed with BCTV, appeared briefly in scenes shot in the BCTV studios.
Reception.
The movie received negative reviews from critics, maintaining only a 27% rating from Rotten Tomatoes. "Life or Something Like It" was also a flop at the box office, grossing only $17 million worldwide and failed to bring back its $40 million budget. Jolie's performance in the film earned her a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress.
