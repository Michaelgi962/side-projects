Black Eye (album)

Black Eye is the only full length album by the English punk rock band Fluffy, released on September 17, 1996 by The Enclave. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics.
Recording and release.
"Black Eye" was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by Bill Price, who also recorded Sex Pistols' "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols". The album cover features a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. According to band co-founder Amanda Rootes, "the thing you notice most is this expression in the mouse's black eye – kind of a moment of serenity before it dies... The title track itself is about domestic violence, and it's one of our favourite songs on the album." The album was released on September 17, 1996 by The Enclave.
Critical reception.
Upon release, "Black Eye" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Tom Sinclair, writing for "Entertainment Weekly", stated that the band "as if they spent their teen years studying the Sex Pistols, Vibrators, and Buzzcocks [... "Black Eye" barrels forward with such high-spirited hookiness that it's possible to forgive the shameless pandering of lyrics like 'I wanna be your kitten/Caress my fur'". Prominent music critic Robert Christgau considered "Black Eye" to be "the most unrelenting (and, not to hedge any bets, best) punk debut" since those by Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Wire. AllMusic reviewer Tom Demalon opined that "the lack of dynamic diversity makes "Black Eye" somewhat of a one-trick pony, but it's a trick that makes the album's strongest tracks a joy".
Nick Duerden of "Q" magazine remarked that the album "sounds like a cross between The Stooges and Courtney Love. And despite boasting the musical dexterity of Status Quo, it's a short, sharp shock that dispatches its venom with a tireless guile." According to "Select" writer Roy Wilkinson, "They brew up a tasty parochial Stooges flavouring on the likes of 'Husband' and 'Nothing', clatter out some early-Banshees "Sturm und Drang" on 'Scream', and get across pretty harrowing depictions of male-on-female violence on 'Dirty Old Bird' and the title track." However, he noted, "They seem intent on falling short of PJ's black-bordered presence. When was the last time you hard the Yeovil delta blues sound enlivened by such Carry On Riffing-isms as 'I've rocketed to Uranus' ('Nothing') and 'When the kids scream, there is a racket/You've got a magnificent packet' ('Too Famous')?"

Million Dollar Traders

Million Dollar Traders was a 2009 British reality television series devised by hedge fund manager Lex van Dam which recreated the famous experiment devised by Richard Dennis in the 1980s.
Background.
"Million Dollar Traders" followed a group of twelve wannabe traders dealing in shares during the events of the financial crisis of 2007-2009 which was then whittled down to the final eight. The contestants came from various backgrounds, including a fight promoter, a day trader, an IT/banking recruitment consultant, a working mother, a retired IT engineer and a student, among others. During the series van Dam gave the London-based contestants the sterling equivalent of $1 million of his own money to trade for 2 months. Former professional trader Anton Kreil, was appointed as the manager of the group.
As with the original experiment, those who lasted the course broadly confirmed the claim that novices could become professional-level traders, making small profits or at least lower losses trading in very turbulent markets during the filming than professionals, who lost four times greater amounts over the same period. The three-part BBC series, narrated by Andrew Lincoln, was a part of the "City Season" programming on the BBC. It aired on BBC 2 in the UK at 9pm on Monday evenings between 12 and 27 January 2009.

Non Professional Swiss Romand Americain Football League

The Non Professional Swiss Romand Americain Football League (NSFL) is a Swiss American Football League. In 1982 Cursio Caravati and Massimo Monti created the SFL (Swiss Football League). The first team to see the day was the Lugano Seagulls. In 2006, only one National Federation is recotnised by the EFAF: The SAFV (Schweizericher America Football Verband), which is divided into two leagues: A National A League (LNA) and a National B League (LNB). A National Championship for juniors also exists.
History.
American Football in Switzerland has only 11 clubs (5 in LNA and 6 in LNB). Due to a lack of structures and comprehension of the needs of smaller teams a regional league was created. The NSFL saw the day in 2004. 6 Teams took part during the first season in 2005 in 2006 two new teams joined the league. Every year new clubs are created or older clubs are able to survive thanks to the NSFL system. Unfortunately the National Federation SAFV does not see the positive work that is done by the NSFL. The NSFL in no means wishes to replace the SAFV. The NSFL is working on a more regional level. The SAFV at the moment refuse to any discussions with the NSFL. The NSFL has in the past met the SAFV; they have brought certain modifications following the SAFV request. One day maybe they will decide to sit at the table and talk with the NSFL or maybe the SAFV clubs might do it.
The different NSFL tournaments put in place do not forbid NSFL teams to participate in the National Championship (SAFV). This is the case of the Fribourg Cardinals (LNB) and the Geneva Seahawks (LNA).

Burntollet bridge incident

Burntollet bridge was the setting for an attack during the first stages of the Troubles of Northern Ireland. A People's Democracy march from Belfast to Derry was attacked whilst passing through Burntollet on 4 January 1969. The march had been called in defiance of an appeal by Northern Ireland Prime Minister Terence O'Neill for a temporary end to protest; older and less radical members of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association also opposed the march as provocative and likely to cause violence. Supporters of Ian Paisley, led by Major Ronald Bunting, denounced the march as seditious and mounted counter-demonstrations along the route. At Burntollet an Ulster loyalist crowd, including 100 off-duty members of the Ulster Special Constabulary (all of the organisers of the attack were USC), numbering in the region of 300, attacked the civil rights marchers from adjacent high ground. Stones transorted in bulk from William Leslie's quarry at Legahurry were used in the assault, as well as iron bars and sticks spiked with nails. Nearby members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary did little to prevent the violence. Many of the marchers described their assailants' lack of concern about the police presence.
Numerous photographs of the violence appeared in the media and led to comparisons with attacks on black civil rights marchers by Southern white racists in the US.The violence was followed by renewed riots in Derry City, while many Ulster Catholics were antagonised when O'Neill and other unionist politicians issued statements blaming the marchers for the violence, and again when the attackers largely evaded prosecution. Loyalists celebrated the attack as a victory. Many Irish nationalists and radicals saw the march as proving that the Northern Ireland polity could not be reformed by peaceful means, while others (including some former participants) later felt that the march had been an irresponsible gesture which helped to precipitate the Troubles by undermining attempts at cross-community compromise. The ambush at Burntollet was described by Paul Bew, an academic at Queen's University Belfast who as a student had participated in the march, as "the spark that lit the prairie fire".

Hans Siegel

Siegfried "Hans" Siegel (25 July 1918 — 18 April 2002) was a Sturmbannführer (Major) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, which was awarded to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership by Nazi Germany during World War II.
Early life.
The only son of Ernst and Liddy Siegel, Siegel was born on 25 July 1918 in Böckau in the Erzgebirge. In his youth he was the leader of the Hitler Youth in his village and later took on the role of social secretary. He also completed voluntary military training at school and at the local sports ground with the 15th SS "Totenkopf" Standarte.
In 1938, after completing his six-month compulsory labour service, he volunteered to join the SS-VT (SS service number 293261) and was assigned to the Leibstandarte SS "Adolf Hitler" Regiment (mot).
World War II.
Siegel took part in the Polish Campaign in 1939, in command of the Heavy Granatwerfer (the standard German medium mortar) platoon, 12th (MG) (Machine Gun) Company. He was then selected to become an officer and sent to the SS-Junkerschule at Bad Tölz. Upon graduation in 1940 he was posted to the 4th (MG) Company, SS Training and Reserve Battalion, LSSAH.
In 1941 he was promoted to Untersturmführer (Second Lieutenant) and in December posted to command the 1st platoon, 3rd Battery, 1st SS Sturmgeschütz (Assault Gun, StuG) Battalion, LSSAH, fighting in Russia in the Taganrog sector beside the Azov Sea.
He took part in the Battle of Kharkov in March 1943, as part of Kampfgruppe (Battle Group) Peiper, which was based on the III. 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, supported by the 3rd SS Sturmgeschütz Battery, under the command of Karl Rettlinger. Siegel was wounded by a sniper during the attack. He was wounded in the head and back which had damaged the 3 and 4 Vertebra in his spine resulting in paralysis from his chest to his legs. He was evacuated first by a Fieseler Storch to Poltava and then by a Ju-52 to Kiev, and then by rail to Stettin, and finally to Berlin. He was hospitalised for six months and after recovery was classified as unfit for front line service.
In the Autumn of 1943 he was given command of the SS Training and Reserve Battalion Truppenübungsplatz in Krakow until January 1944, when he was posted to the Panzer Division "Hitlerjugend" and given command of the 8th Company, II Battalion, at the request of Lieutenant Colonel Max Wünsche.
During the Normandy Invasion Siegel and his company were always in the thick of the fighting. He was wounded for the fifth time on 27 June 1944, when his Panzer was hit and he received severe burns on his face and hands. He refused to be evacuated to the rear and remained with the Division.
He was awarded the Knight's Cross for his bravery and leadership in Normandy, in the Caen sector at Le Mesnil-Patry and Cheux, when on 27 June his company destroyed 37 Allied tanks, 11 of which Siegel destroyed himself.
After a short stay in a field hospital he returned to the division and was given command of the II.Battalion, 12th SS Panzer Regiment after its previous commander Karl Heinz Prinz was killed in action in August 1944.
During the fighting in spring 1945, in the Esztergom Bridgehead, in preparation for Operation Spring Awakening, the Battalion committed itself to a night attack during the night of 7 and 8 March, and overcame a Russian anti-tank force within the first two kilometers advancing towards Puszta Antal which is six kilometers away. Siegel led the remaining Panzer IVs of the regiment in a number of small actions, until the division was forced to withdraw. He commanded the rear guard, and on 24 March in a duel with a T-34 he received his ninth wound and was evacuated by rail to St Pölten. After treatment for damage to his knee he returned to his battalion on crutches with a cast around his knee.
Siegel remained with the Division and was wounded again on 8 May 1945, after sustaining a shattered left elbow. His arm was amputated in a Russian hospital.
Post war.
After his release from Russian captivity Siegel returned to Austria, but moved to West Germany after it became known to the occupying power he was an ex-SS officer and they tried to arrest him. He went on to study at the university of Emden and studied architecture at the university of Stuttgart.
After graduating he worked successfully as an architect and formed his own company.
He also took part in battlefield tours and had a high reputation with the Staff College of the Canadian Armed Forces, participating in 19 battlefield tours going over the battlefields that the 12th SS Panzer Division had fought over, his last tour being in 2001.
Hans Siegel died on 18 April 2002 in Andernach.

<doc id="21365109" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21365109" title="Emmanuel Movement">
Emmanuel Movement

The Emmanuel Movement was a psychologically-based approach to religious healing introduced in 1906 as an outreach of the Emmanuel Church in Boston, Massachusetts. In practice, the religious element was de-emphasized and the primary modalities were individual and group therapy. Episcopal priests Elwood Worcester and Samuel McComb established a clinic at the church which lasted 23 years and offered both medical and psychological services. The primary long-term influence of the movement, however, was on the treatment of alcoholism.
Religious background: Worcester and McComb.
Elwood Worcester (1862–1940) was the originator of the Emmanuel movement philosophy. He was raised in an educated middle-class family which fell into poverty as a result of business reversals and the death of Worcester's father. After high school, Worcester went to work at a railway claim-department office. One day, while alone in the office, he had an experience of the room filling with light and heard the words, "Be faithful to me and I will be faithful to you." After discussing the experience with his priest, Algernon Crapsey, he became convinced that he was called to the ministry. At the time he was supporting his family, but he later entered Columbia University on scholarship and earned a bachelor's degree with highest honors.
As a candidate for orders Worcester was required to attend a recognized seminary, in spite of his own conviction that he would be better prepared by attending a German university. He was able to satisfy the requirements for the first two years of General Seminary in New York by studying the texts and passing examinations. He then graduated from the Seminary after only one year of full-time attendance and immediately left for Germany to enter the University of Leipzig. After an initial year devoted to classical studies, he spent two years studying with Franz Delitzsch, foremost Hebraist of the day, and psychologists Wilhelm Wundt and Gustav Theodor Fechner. In his autobiography, Worcester recalled that the liberal German academic tradition, which "tends to weaken and remove the false opposition which has grown up between the things of the mind and the things of the Spirit," was the inspiration for much of his later work.
After his ordination in 1891, Worcester became chaplain and professor of psychology and philosophy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. His indecision between academic and parish work was resolved by a call to a historic parish in Philadelphia, St. Stephen's. One of his parishioners at St. Stephens was noted neurologist S. Weir Mitchell, who became a close friend and a source of guidance in the application of depth psychology to ministry. After 8 years Worcester moved on to Emmanuel Church in Boston. The next year he was joined by Samuel McComb as associate rector. McComb (1864–1938) was raised in Belfast, Ireland and educated at Oxford. He had been a professor of church history at Queens University in Ontario and served as minister of Presbyterian churches in England and New York City, before being ordained in the Episcopal Church. A popular speaker and an excellent writer, he became the primary spokesman for the movement during its active years.
Medical background: Cabot, Pratt, Putnam and Coriat.
Boston was the center of a local "medical psychotherapy" tradition going back to the 1890s when William James, Josiah Royce, Hugo Munsterberg and Boris Sidis developed individualized techniques for the relief of mental distress. The psychiatric professionals of the 19th century, alienists and neurologists, were primarily concerned with severe pathology such as schizophrenia and mania. Little attention was paid to milder mental conditions. The New England psychopathologists, in contrast, dealt with the problems of those who were more or less functional but unhappy. They treated patients with anxiety or depression or in the grip of compulsive behaviors. James Jackson Putnam (1846–1918), Harvard's first professor of diseases of the nervous system and a founder of the American Psychoanalytic Association, was influenced by this tradition of eclectic therapy. He saw the Emmanuel movement, with its synthesis of psychology and "moral" treatment, as a positive development. His support was important in the reception of the movement by the orthodox medical community.
Dr. Richard C. Cabot, in 1905, concluded that he didn’t have enough information to make exact diagnoses of his patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital clinics. He didn’t know where they lived or worked, what they worried about or ate for dinner. He believed it was important to understand his patients’ economic situation, what toxins they may have been exposed to and how they were handling the stress of daily life. With his own money, he hired a nurse, Garnet Pelton, to serve as Mass General’s first social worker. Then, in 1907, Dr. Cabot hired Ida Cannon as the first chief, and together, they led the development and growth of the first social services department in a hospital in the United States. He became chief of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1912 until his retirement, was an innovator in both medical education and psychosocial medicine. He introduced the first weekly "Grand Rounds," now traditional in teaching hospitals. Cabot wrote popular books on counseling, ethics and religion which reflected his continuing loyalty to the philosophy he had learned under Josiah Royce.
Dr. Joseph Pratt (1872–1956) received his degree in medicine (1898) from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he studied under William H. Welch and Sir William Osler. He joined Cabot's tuberculosis clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1903. From 1927 he served as chief of medicine at the Boston Dispensary and professor at Tufts University School of Medicine. The Pratt Diagnostic Clinic at Tufts Medical Center is named in his honor. Although tuberculosis was then endemic in urban areas, treatments in vogue were labor-intensive and available mainly to the affluent. If there was any hope of offering this sort of care to the poor, Dr. Pratt realized that working with groups of patients and care-givers would be necessary. He also had a lifelong interest in the influence of psychosocial factors on physical and mental illness, so he had confidence in the value of integrated support systems.
Dr. Isador Coriat (1875–1943) was a Tufts neurologist/psychopathologist whose major professional influence was Morton Prince. Unlike most of his medical colleagues, Corait was the son of Jewish immmigrants of limited means. He had entered medical school directly from the public school system and began his medical career at Worcester State Hospital under Dr. Adolf Meyer. As a member of the first generation of American psychoanalysts, he was a link between 19th century experimental psychology and 20th century dynamic psychiatry.
Early projects.
In 1905, Dr. Pratt asked Elwood Worcester if Emmanuel Church could offer any support for a project to improve the care of tuberculosis patients living in the poorest sections of Boston. Dr. Pratt hoped to encourage rest, optimal nutrition and fresh air (the primary treatments then used in tuberculosis sanatoria) through classes and home visits. Emmanuel Church provided both meeting space and the entire funding of the project, but there was no clergy involvement or religious component.
Encouraged by the success of the tuberculosis class, Worcester consulted local neurologists about the possibility of similar work among the "nervously and morally diseased." He assured them that he was not attempting to establish any new doctrine, but only to give each patient the best opportunity possible for health and well-being. The response was positive. Dr. James Putnam presided over the first meeting to plan the new project. Cabot and Coriat served as speakers and medical advisors.
These preliminary meetings developed into the "Weekly Health Conference." Each meeting began with hymns and prayers, and included a lecture by a medical doctor or member of the clergy. The techniques of suggestion and auto-suggestion were a strong component of their psychology, but the approach was eclectic. Spiritual lectures often reflected New Thought influence. The formal program was followed by an hour of fellowship, at which there was only one rule: no mention of disease was allowed.
In 1908 a fire destroyed much of the town of Chelsea. Worcester, McComb and members of the church moved quickly to assist those left homeless. They rented one of the few homes left standing and turned it into the "Emmanuel Relief Station", offering food and clothing. Next they arranged for the help of doctors in treating burns and wounds, and provided instruments and supplies. The house was also used for the care of women during and after childbirth (at the time most babies were delivered at home, at least among the poor). After the relief station closed, the parish expanded the care offered at their primary location to include some medical services.
With the expansion of the Social Services Department, the church needed a full-time worker to supervise the projects. Courtenay Baylor (b. 1870), a former insurance salesman who had come to Elwood Worcester for help with his own problems a few years earlier, was hired in 1912. His role grew over time to that of a lay psychotherapist.
Years of growth.
Ladies Home Journal published a series of articles written by Elwood Worcester in 1908-9 introducing his ideas to a national audience. The first book about the movement, "Religion and Medicine, The Moral Control of Nervous Disorders" by Worcester, McComb and Isador Coriat, appeared in 1908. The book went through nine printings in its first year of publication as the popularity of the movement grew.
Four components made up the primary approach to therapy. The church continued to offer large lectures and classes, primarily devoted to what would now be termed "functional" illness (Worcester and McComb did not claim that they could cure organic disease). There was a clinic, held under the auspices of the church and staffed by physicians, which offered some traditional medical care. The third component, unique at the time, offered the services of "lay therapists" who were trained on the job by Worcester, McComb and others. Treatment consisted of a relatively brief form of analysis, support and direction for making changes in the patient's life, and the use of suggestion to relieve symptoms. Therapy was reinforced by volunteers who visited the patients at home.
Notoriety and opposition.
Publicity brought criticism, particularly from conservative physicians. Cabot, Coriat, and Pratt, however, remained loyal despite the onslaught. Putnam, who had been an early sponsor, withdrew his support in 1907 due to concerns that medical supervision was inadequate. Worcester took steps to increase the role of doctors in response to the criticism. He also reduced his contact with the media, as the notoriety was an annoyance to some of his parishioners.
Clarence Farrar, a Maryland psychiatrist, compared the movement to Christian Science. "Just now," he wrote, "while the mother science of Mrs. Eddy, synchronously with the patent medicine fraternity, has been getting into somewhat ill odor throughout the states, a Son of the Blood arises in the person of the Reverend Elwood Worcester, of Boston, and from the land of witchcraft and transcendentalism we receive a new gospel." The physicians supporting to movement, he claimed, were "willing to sell their birthright and to surrender a part of their legitimate province, to hand over impotently to the clergy for treatment, certain conditions which are just as truly the manifestations of disease or trauma as would be a broken limb or febrile delirium." 
Sigmund Freud made his only visit to the United States in 1909, at the height of the media coverage of the Emmanuel movement. In an interview with a reporter for the "Boston Evening Transcript" on September 11, 1909, Freud admitted that he knew very little about the movement but said that "this undertaking of a few men without medical, or with very superficial medical training, seems to me at the very least of questionable good."
Later years.
Samuel McComb left Emmanuel Church in 1916 to become dean of the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Baltimore, Maryland. He returned to the Boston area a few years later to teach at Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, then moved to France to become rector of the American Episcopal Church in Nice. Elwood Worcester had little time to devote to work with individuals while serving as rector, but continued to supervise Courtenay Baylor and other lay therapists who trained at Emmanuel. In 1931, Worcester retired from Emmanuel Church. Courtenay Baylor arranged for the use of a house in Boston, and the two incorporated as the Craigie Foundation in order to continue their counseling work.
"Body, Mind and Spirit," by Elwood Worcester and Samuel McComb, was published in 1931. In the book's introduction, Worcester reflected on "the remedial ministry undertaken by my associates and by me in Emmanuel Church, Boston." They had begun in a time when the pre-Freudian methods of psychotherapeutic work dominated the field, and later incorporated, in a limited way, some of the methods of psychoanalysis. They had "prepared hundreds of patients for surgical operations . . . had been able to remove pain and to obtain natural sleep. . . I am thinking primarily, however, of alcoholism and of other drug addictions. It is well known that we have obtained as good and as permanent results in these fields as any other workers, and these results have been obtained by suggestion and by the inculcation of new and more spiritual principles."
Influence.
Ernest Jacoby, a businessman and Emmanuel parishioner, began weekly meetings for men with alcohol problems in 1909. Later the group was advertised as "A Club for Men to Help Themselves by Helping Others." In a 1910 church newsletter Elwood Worcester wrote that it was not "an ordinary temperance society," that the goal was "to see that careful scientific treatment by qualified physicians and clergymen is administered to those who need it." Primarily, however, the group was devoted to mutual help. The Jacoby Club remained active through the 1920s and 30s, and in its declining years provided space for the earliest Boston meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Courtenay Baylor became well known as an expert on alcoholism, publishing a description of his methods in 1919. One of the recovering alcoholics who attended his classes in 1921-22 was Richard R. Peabody, a descendant of a wealthy and influential Boston family. Peabody trained as a lay therapist under Baylor's direction and then set up his own practice, first in Boston and then in New York City. His 1931 book, "The Common Sense of Drinking", was dedicated to Baylor and became a classic in the field of alcoholism treatment.

History of Panama (1821–1903)

Independence.
In 1819, Panama was technically liberated and freed as a part of New Granada, which gained its freedom in the independence movement that clinched the liberation of New Granada (Colombia) from Spain. Panama would remain as a royalist stronghold and outpost until 1821. Panama City immediately initiated plans to declare independence, but the city of Los Santos preempted the move by proclaiming freedom from Spain on November 10, 1821. This act precipitated a meeting in Panama City on November 28, which is celebrated as the official date of independence. Considerable discussion followed as to whether Panama should remain part of Colombia (then comprising both the present-day country and Venezuela) or unite with Peru. The bishop of Panama, a native Peruvian who realized the commercial ties that could be developed with his country, argued for the latter solution but was voted down. A third possible course of action, a union with Mexico proposed by emissaries of that country, was rejected.
Panama thus became part of Colombia, then governed under the 1821 Constitution of Cúcuta, and was designated a department with two provinces, Panamá and Veraguas. With the addition of Ecuador to the liberated area, the whole country became known as Gran Colombia. Panama sent a force of 700 men to join Simón Bolívar in Peru, where the war of liberation continued.
The termination of hostilities against the royalists in 1824 failed to bring tranquillity to Gran Colombia. The constitution that Bolívar had drafted for Bolivia was put forward by him to be adopted in Gran Colombia. The country was divided principally over the proposal that a president would serve for life. The president would not be responsible to the legislature and would have power to select his vice president. Other provisions, generally centralist in their tendencies, were repugnant to some, while a few desired a monarchy. Panama escaped armed violence over the constitutional question but joined other regions in petitioning Bolívar to assume dictatorial powers until a convention could meet. Panama announced its union with Gran Colombia as a "Hanseatic State", i.e., as an autonomous area with special trading privileges until the convention was held.
In 1826 Bolívar honored Panama when he chose it as the site for a congress of the recently liberated Spanish colonies. Many leaders of the revolutions in Latin America considered the establishment of a single government for the former Spanish colonies the natural follow-up to driving out the "peninsulares". Both José de San Martín and Francisco de Miranda proposed creating a single vast monarchy ruled by an emperor descended from the Incas. Bolívar, however, was the one who made the most serious attempt to unite the Spanish American republics.
Although the league or confederation envisioned by Bolívar was to foster the blessings of liberty and justice, a primary purpose was to secure the independence of the former colonies from renewed attacks by Spain and its allies. In this endeavor Bolívar sought Britain's protection. He was reluctant to invite representatives of the United States, even as observers, to the congress of plenipotentiaries lest their collaboration compromise the league's position with the British. Furthermore, Bolívar felt that the neutrality of the United States in the war between Spain and its former colonies would make its representation inappropriate. In addition, slavery in the United States would be an obstacle in discussing the abolition of the African slave trade. Bolívar nevertheless acquiesced when the governments of Colombia, Mexico, and Central America invited the United States to send observers.
Despite the sweeping implications of the Monroe Doctrine, President John Quincy Adams—in deciding to send delegates to the Panama conference—was not disposed to obligate the United States to defend its southern neighbors. Adams instructed his delegates to refrain from participating in deliberations concerning regional security and to emphasize discussions of maritime neutrality and commerce. Nevertheless, many members of the United States Congress opposed participation under any conditions. By the time participation was approved, the delegation had no time to reach the conference. The British and Dutch sent unofficial representatives.
The Congress of Panama, which convened in June and adjourned in July 1826, was attended by four American states—Mexico, Central America, Colombia, and Peru. The Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation drawn up at that congress would have bound all parties to mutual defense and to the peaceful settlement of disputes. Furthermore, because some feared that monarchical elements sympathetic to Spain and its allies might regain control of one of the new republics, the treaty included a provision that if a member state substantially changed its form of government, it would be excluded from the confederation and could be readmitted only with the unanimous consent of all other members.
The treaty was ratified only by Colombia and never became effective. Bolívar, having made several futile attempts to establish lesser federations, declared shortly before his death in 1830 that "America is ungovernable; those who served the revolution have plowed the sea." Despite his disillusion, however, he did not see United States protection as a substitute for collective security arrangements among the Spanish-speaking states. In fact, he is credited with having said, "The United States seems destined by Providence to plague America with misery in the name of Liberty."
Three abortive attempts to separate the isthmus from Colombia occurred between 1830 and 1840. The first was undertaken by an acting governor of Panama who opposed the policies of the president, but the Panamanian leader reincorporated the department of Panama at the urging of Bolívar, then on his deathbed. The second attempted separation was the scheme of an unpopular dictator, who was soon deposed and executed. The third secession, a response to civil war in Colombia, was declared by a popular assembly, but reintegration took place a year later.
The California gold rush and the railroad.
Even before the United States acquired California after the Mexican–American War (1846–48), many heading for California used the isthmus crossing in preference to the long and dangerous wagon route across the vast plains and rugged mountain ranges. Discovery of gold in 1848 increased traffic greatly. In 1847 a group of New York financiers organized the Panama Railroad Company. This company secured an exclusive concession from Colombia allowing construction of a crossing, which might be by road, rail, river, or a combination. After surveys, a railroad was chosen, and a new contract so specifying was obtained in 1850. The railroad track followed generally the line of the present canal. The first through train from the Atlantic to the Pacific side ran on the completed track on January 28, 1855.
The gold rush traffic, even before the completion of the railroad, restored Panama's prosperity. Between 1848 and 1869, about 375,000 persons crossed the isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and 225,000 crossed in the opposite direction. Prices for food and services were greatly inflated, producing enormous profits from meals and lodging.
The railroad also created a new city and port at the Atlantic terminus of the line. The town that immediately sprang up to accommodate the railroad offices, warehouses, docks, and shops and to lodge both railroad workers and passengers soon became, and remains, the second largest in the country. United States citizens named it Aspinwall, after one of the founders of the Panama Railroad Company, but the Panamanians christened it Colón, in honor of Columbus. Both names were used for many years, but because the Panamanians insisted that no such place as Aspinwall existed and refused to deliver mail so addressed, the name Colón prevailed.
The gold rush and the railroad also brought the United States "Wild West" to the isthmus. The forty-niners tended to be an unruly lot, usually bored as they waited for a ship to California, frequently drunk, and often armed. Many also displayed prejudice verging on contempt for other races and cultures. The so-called Watermelon War of 1856, in which at least sixteen persons were killed, was the most serious clash of races and cultures of the period.
In 1869 the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in the United States. This development reduced passenger and freight traffic across the isthmus and diminished the amount of gold and silver shipped east. During the height of the gold rush, however, from 1855 to 1858, only one-tenth of the ordinary commercial freight was destined for or originated in California. The balance concerned trade of the North Americans with Europe and Asia. The railroad company, because of its exceptionally high return on a capitalization that never exceeded US$7 million, paid a total of nearly US$38 million in dividends between 1853 and 1905. Panama received US$25,000 from Colombia's annuity and benefited from transient trade and some inflow of capital.
The uncompleted French canal.
Throughout the nineteenth century, governments and private investors in the United States, Britain, and France intermittently displayed interest in building a canal across the Western Hemisphere. Several sites were considered, but from the start the ones in Nicaragua and Panama received the most serious attention. President Andrew Jackson sent Charles A. Biddle as his emissary in the 1830s to investigate both routes, but the project was aborted when Biddle abandoned his government mission and negotiated instead with Colombian capitalists for a private concession.
Nevertheless, Colombia continued to express interest in negotiating with the United States on building a canal. A treaty was signed in 1846 between the two countries. The treaty removed the existing restrictive tariffs and gave the United States and its citizens the right of free transit of persons and goods over any road or canal that might be constructed in the isthmus. In addition, the United States guaranteed the neutrality of the isthmus and Colombia's sovereignty over it, with a view to ensuring uninterrupted transit for the duration of the treaty, which was to be twenty years or as long thereafter as the parties gave no notice to revise it. Called the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty of 1846, it was actually ratified and became effective in 1848.
Because the canal interests of Britain and the United States had continued to clash, particularly in Nicaragua, Britain and the United States sought to ease tensions by entering into the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850. The governments agreed specifically that neither would acquire rights to or construct a Nicaraguan canal without the participation of the other. This general principle was extended to any canal or railroad across Central America, to include the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico and Panama. In effect, since neither government was then willing or able to begin a canal, the treaty was for the time an instrument of neutrality.
Colombia's attempt to attract canal interest finally brought French attention to bear on Panama. After several surveys, a concession of exclusive rights was obtained from Colombia, and a company was formed in 1879 to construct a sea-level canal generally along the railroad route. Ferdinand de Lesseps, of Suez Canal fame, headed the company. The terms of the concession required completion in twelve years, with the possibility of a six-year extension at Colombia's discretion. The lease was for ninety years and was transferable, but not to any foreign government. The company also purchased most of the stock of the Panama Railroad Company, which, however, continued to be managed by Americans.
A ceremonious commencement of work was staged by de Lesseps on January 1, 1880, but serious earth moving did not start until the next year. As work progressed, engineers judged that a sea-level canal was impracticable. De Lesseps, a promoter but not an engineer, could not be convinced until work had gone on for six years. Actual labor on a lock canal did not start until late in 1888, by which time the company was in serious financial difficulty. At the peak of its operations the company employed about 10,000 workers.
De Lesseps had to contend not only with enemies who hampered financing by spreading rumors of failure and dumping stocks and bonds on the market but also with venal French politicians and bureaucrats who demanded large bribes for approving the issue of securities. His efforts to get the French government to guarantee his bonds were blocked by the United States, on the grounds that such action would lead to government control in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. The end result in January 1889 was the appointment of a receiver to liquidate the company, whereupon all work stopped.
Despite the French company's disastrous financial experience, an estimated two-fifths of the excavation necessary for the eventual canal had been completed. Many headquarters and hospital buildings were finished. Some of the machinery left on the site was usable later, and the railroad had been maintained. Another legacy of the French company's bankruptcy was a large labor force, now unemployed, mostly Antillean blacks. More than half were repatriated, but thousands remained, many of whom eventually worked on the United States canal.
The spillover from Colombia's civil strife.
During the last half of the nineteenth century, violent clashes between the supporters of the Liberal and Conservative parties in Colombia left the isthmus' affairs in constant turmoil. Local self-government for the department of Panama was extended when the Liberals were in power and withdrawn when the Conservatives prevailed. The Catholic Church was disestablished under the Liberals and reestablished under the Conservatives. The fortunes of local partisans rose and fell abruptly and often violently.
According to one estimate, the period witnessed forty administrations of the Panamanian department, fifty riots and rebellions, five attempted secessions, and thirteen interventions by the United States, acting under the provisions of the Bidlack-Mallarino Treaty. Partisan clashes and foreign intervention exacerbated racial antagonisms and economic problems and intensified grievances against the central government of Colombia.
Between 1863 and 1886, the isthmus had twenty-six presidents. "Coup d'état", rebellions, and violence were almost continuous, staged by troops of the central government, by local citizens against centrally imposed edicts, and by factions out of power. The chaotic conditions that had prevailed under the federalist constitution of 1863 culminated in the 1884 election of Rafael Núñez as president of Colombia, supported by a coalition of moderate Liberals and Conservatives. Núñez called all factions to participate in a new constituent assembly, but his request was met by an armed revolt of the radical Liberals.
Early in 1885, a revolt headed by a radical Liberal general and centered in Panama City developed into a three-way fight. Colón was virtually destroyed. United States forces landed at the request of the Colombian government but were too late to save the city from being burned. Millions of dollars in claims were submitted by companies and citizens of the United States, France, and Britain, but Colombia successfully pleaded its lack of responsibility.
Additional United States naval forces occupied both Colón and Panama City and guarded the railroad to ensure uninterrupted transit until Colombian forces landed to protect the railroad. The new constitution of 1886 established the Republic of Colombia as a unitary state; departments were distinctly subordinate to the central government, and Panama was singled out as subject to the direct authority of the government. The United States consul general reported that three-quarters of the Panamanians wanted independence from Colombia and would revolt if they could get arms and be sure of freedom from United States intervention.
Panama was drawn into Colombia's Thousand Days' War (1899–1902) by rebellious radical Liberals who had taken refuge in Nicaragua. Like the rest of Colombia, opinion in Panama was divided, and revolts in the southwest had hardly been suppressed when Liberals from Nicaragua invaded the Pacific coastal region and nearly succeeded in taking Panama City in mid-1900. The fortunes of war varied, and although a local armistice gave supporters of the Colombian government temporary security in the Panama-Colón region, the rebels were in control throughout the isthmus. Meanwhile, by early 1902 the rebels had been defeated in most of Colombia proper. At that point, the Colombian government asked the United States to intercede and bring about an armistice in Panama, which was arranged aboard the in the Bay of Panama in 1902.
Throughout the period of turmoil, the United States had retained its interest in building a canal through either Nicaragua or Panama. An obstacle to this goal was overcome in December 1901 when the United States and Britain signed the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty. This treaty nullified the provisions of the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 and signified British acceptance of a canal constructed solely by or under the auspices of the United States with guarantees of neutrality.
The 1903 treaty and qualified independence.
Naval operations during the Spanish–American War (1898–1901) served to convince U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt that the United States needed to control a canal somewhere in the Western Hemisphere. This interest culminated in the Spooner Bill of June 29, 1902, providing for a canal through the isthmus of Panama, and the Hay–Herrán Treaty of January 22, 1903, under which Colombia gave consent to such a project in the form of a 100-year lease on an area 10 kilometers wide. This treaty, however, was not ratified in Bogotá, and the United States, determined to construct a canal across the isthmus, intensively encouraged the Panamanian separatist movement.
By July 1903, when the course of internal Colombian opposition to the Hay–Herrán Treaty became obvious, a revolutionary junta had been created in Panama. José Augustin Arango, an attorney for the Panama Railroad Company, headed the junta. Manuel Amador Guerrero and Carlos C. Arosemena served on the junta from the start, and five other members, all from prominent Panamanian families, were added. Arango was considered the brains of the revolution, and Amador was the junta's active leader.
With financial assistance arranged by Philippe Bunau-Varilla, a French national representing the interests of Lesseps's company, the native Panamanian leaders conspired to take advantage of United States interest in a new regime on the isthmus. In October and November 1903, the revolutionary junta, with the protection of United States naval forces, carried out a successful uprising against the Colombian government. Acting, paradoxically, under the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty of 1846 between the United States and Colombia—which provided that United States forces could intervene in the event of disorder on the isthmus to guarantee Colombian sovereignty and open transit across the isthmus—the United States prevented a Colombian force from moving across the isthmus to Panama City to suppress the insurrection.
President Roosevelt recognized the new Panamanian junta as the de facto government on November 6, 1903; de jure recognition came on November 13. Five days later Bunau-Varilla, as the diplomatic representative of Panama (a role he had purchased through financial assistance to the rebels) concluded the Isthmian Canal Convention with Secretary of State John Hay in Washington, D.C. Bunau-Varilla had not lived in Panama for seventeen years before the incident, and he never returned. Nevertheless, while residing in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, he wrote the Panamanian declaration of independence and constitution and designed the Panamanian flag. Isthmian patriots particularly resented the haste with which Bunau-Varilla concluded the treaty, an effort partially designed to preclude any objections an arriving Panamanian delegation might raise. Nonetheless, the Panamanians, having no apparent alternative, ratified the treaty on December 2, and approval by the United States Senate came on February 23, 1904.
The rights granted to the United States in the so-called Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty were extensive. They included a grant "in perpetuity of the use, occupation, and control" of a sixteen-kilometer-wide strip of territory and extensions of three nautical miles into the sea from each terminal "for the construction, maintenance, operation, sanitation, and protection" of an isthmian canal.
Furthermore, the United States was entitled to acquire additional areas of land or water necessary for canal operations and held the option of exercising eminent domain in Panama City. Within this territory Washington gained "all the rights, power, and authority . . . which the United States would possess and exercise if it were the sovereign ... to the entire exclusion" of Panama.
The Republic of Panama became a de facto protectorate of the larger country through two provisions whereby the United States guaranteed the independence of Panama and received in return the right to intervene in Panama's domestic affairs. For the rights it obtained, the United States was to pay the sum of US$10 million and an annuity, beginning 9 years after ratification, of US$250,000 in gold coin. The United States also purchased the rights and properties of the French canal company for US $40 million.
Colombia was the harshest critic of United States policy at the time. A reconciliatory treaty with the United States providing an indemnity of US$25 million was finally concluded between these two countries in 1921 and finally by 1922. Ironically, however, friction resulting from the events of 1903 was greatest between the United States and Panama. Major disagreements arose concerning the rights granted to the United States by the treaty of 1903 and the Panamanian constitution of 1904. The United States government subsequently interpreted these rights to mean that the United States could exercise complete sovereignty over all matters in the Canal Zone. Panama, although admitting that the clauses were vague and obscure, later held that the original concession of authority related only to the construction, operation, and defense of the canal and that rights and privileges not necessary to these functions had never been relinquished.

Career.
Bauer began his senior career at TuS Mayen in the then fifth-tier Verbandsliga Rheinland, winning promotion to tier IV in his first season. After the club finished 12th in the Oberliga Südwest, Bauer moved to 2. Bundesliga side SV Eintracht Trier 05 where he spent the next four years, playing in 26 2. Bundesliga matches and then ten Regionalliga Süd matches following Trier's relegation at the end of the 2004–05 season.
After his contract was not renewed following another relegation of Eintracht Trier, Bauer was unemployed for a while after injuring himself on the last day of his trial at 1. FC Union Berlin when he tore three ligaments in his ankle joint. However, Bauer was able to sign a contract with Union Berlin in the following winter and played in ten Regionalliga Nord games for the club. 
However, Bauer was not able to agree on a new contract with the club and was again unemployed until signing a contract with Finnish top-tier club RoPS. Here Bauer played in nine matches in the Veikkausliiga, but bad luck hit again when he broke his shoulder blade in June. Despite being highly valued in the league – Finnish sports magazine Urheilulehti ranked him eight-best foreign player – his contract was not renewed at the end of the season and Bauer faced unemployment again.
On 2 February 2009, Bauer signed a contract with Regionalliga Nord side 1. FC Magdeburg that will keep him at the club until June 2010. He later extended his contract until June 2011.
After Bauer was allegedly threatened by disgruntled fans of 1. FC Magdeburg, he dissolved his contract and joined Eintracht Trier in early 2012, before moving on to VfB Oldenburg in the summer.

Post-wall waveguide

A post-wall waveguide (also known as substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) or a laminated waveguide) is a synthetic rectangular electromagnetic waveguide formed in a dielectric substrate by densely arraying metallized posts or via-holes which connect the upper and lower metal plates of the substrate. The waveguide can be easily fabricated with low-cost and mass-production using through-hole techniques where the post walls consists of via fences. The post-wall waveguide is known to have similar guided wave and mode characteristics to the conventional rectangular waveguide with equivalent guided wavelength.
For instance, the equivalent width of a rectangular waveguide compared to a SIW is described in the approximation:
formula_1
where formula_2 is the distance between the posts in the post wall, formula_3 describes the radius, and formula_4 as well as formula_5 are the widths of the rectangular waveguide, resp. SIW.

"American Idol".
Overview.
Desai rose to national fame with his participation in the eighth season of "American Idol". He auditioned for the show on August 8, 2008 in Kansas City, Missouri, and was selected as a semifinalist following his "Hollywood Week" performances. Although he was not one of the three finalists chosen out of his semifinal performance group, he returned as a "Wild Card." The judges saved Desai for last on Wild Card night and after announcing that Matt Giraud had made the Top 12, Simon Cowell then revealed the twist of Season 8: that Desai would also move onto the finals, leading to the first ever Top 13 in Idol history.
Desai's first finals performance of Michael Jackson's "Beat It" was panned by the judges, with Simon Cowell saying that it was "very lightweight" and that he regretted choosing Desai for the Top 13. But Desai won the judges over again the next week, when he sang Willie Nelson's classic country ballad "Always On My Mind" for "Grand Ol' Opry Week." Even Cowell was impressed, and retracted his remarks about Desai not deserving to be in the Top 13. Desai's rendition of Cyndi Lauper's "True Colors" three weeks later, which also garnered praise from the judges, prompted Cowell to compare the contestant to a "yo-yo", going back and forth between good and weak performances.
Nonetheless, Desai landed in the Bottom Two that week, just as he had the previous week. He finished in the Bottom Three during Top 7 week, when Matt Giraud was saved from elimination by the judges. This meant the next week would be a double elimination, wherein Desai ended up being voted off along with Lil Rounds.
Celebrities such as Ellen DeGeneres and Keith Urban said they favored Desai to win.
Desai returned for the season finale of "Idol"'s Season 8 to perform "I'm Yours" with fellow "Idol" contestant Alexis Grace and singer Jason Mraz.
Post-Idol.
Since appearing on American Idol, Desai has appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", "Live with Regis and Kelly", "The Mo'Nique Show", "Access Hollywood", "Today", and local radio stations across the nation. He has also performed with Amos Lee in Atlanta, Georgia. Desai also performed on the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2009 with his fellow Top 10 contestants; the tour visited 50 cities in the United States and Canada from July 5 to September 15, 2009.
Desai's first single, titled "My Name," was co-written by Brandon Rogers and Desai, and was released on March 23, 2010. His debut album, titled "All Is Fair", was produced by Ian Schreier and was released on May 4, 2010.
Desai's second single, titled "All Is Fair (Crazy Love)," was co-written by David Mikush and Desai. Desai was selected by Clear Channel Music and iheartradio as an "artist to watch" for September 2010 with this single as the featured track. The music video for "All Is Fair (Crazy Love)" was released on February 3, 2011.
Desai began performing in live concerts as a part of the All Is Fair Tour in Fall, 2010, with the first show in Carrboro, N.C., on October 8, 2010. In addition to the headlining shows, he often performs at charity appearances.
Desai now resides in Atlanta, Georgia, and is currently working on a project entitled Zero: The Mixtape. The project is a collaboration with Atlanta-based musicians, writers and producers including DJ Trauma. The mixtape will be released in multiple parts, and the first installment was to become available on March 23, 2011. The second EP is expected to release in July, and the third EP is expected to release in October.

He was a 2003 and 2004 Parade Magazine High School All American soccer player and the 2004 NSCAA National High School Player of the Year for the Glen Cove Big Red. He led his club team, the Albertson Red Storm, to both the 2003 and 2004 USYSA National Championships and the Red Storm Academy to the 2004 Super Y-League Championship.

During the 2007 collegiate offseason, he played for the Long Island Rough Riders in the fourth division USL Premier Development League. In 2008, he played five more games for Long Island before switching to play for the Cary RailHawks U23's mid-season.
Leeds United.
2008–09 season.
In February 2009, he was drafted in the third round (34th overall) of the 2009 MLS SuperDraft by Toronto FC. However, Grella decided against signing for the Canadian club, and instead tried his luck at playing in Europe. Grella went on trial with Leeds United in January 2009, and scored a hat-trick for the club's reserves on the 21st of that month against Barnsley FC.
He also scored a goal in a behind closed doors game, with news of a permanent deal pending. He signed a full-time contract for Leeds United on transfer deadline day, 2 February 2009, until the end of the 2009–10 season.
He made his Leeds debut on 14 February 2009, after coming on as a 74th minute substitute for Lee Trundle in a 1–0 defeat to Huddersfield Town. His first season in professional football was mainly spent making short cameos as a substitute during Leeds fight for promotion. He came on late in Leeds' playoff semi final against Millwall but was unable to grab a goal so far during his first team appearances for Leeds.
2009–10 season.
Grella scored his first senior goal for Leeds in a pre-season friendly against Burnley. On 10 August 2009 he was voted Man Of The Match in a League Cup match against Darlington although he didn't score. He signed a new long term contract with Leeds.
Grella had to wait just over seven months for his first league start. Replacing the injured Jermaine Beckford in the starting line up for the visit of Stockport County to Elland Road on 5 September 2009, it took him just eight minutes to score his first league goal, curling in an opportunistic effort from the edge of the penalty area.
With seven subs required for the 2009–10 season Grella has found himself used mainly as a substitute in games, coming on as a substitute to try make an impact in games.
Grella scored for Leeds after coming on as a late substitute in the 2–0 FA Cup win against Oldham. He repeated this FA Cup goalscoring form on 8 December 2009 in the FA Cup replay against Kettering Town, coming on as a substitute during the second period of extra time. Grella's introduction changed the pace of the game (which had previously been 1–1), as he scored twice as Leeds won the game 5–1, taking his tally to four for Leeds. Grella started for Leeds in the Football League Trophy game against Accrington Stanley. Grella was substituted in the same game and replaced by Sam Vokes. Grella was an unused substitute for Leeds' victory away to Manchester United in the FA Cup third round. Grella started Leeds' Football League Trophy Northern Area Final first leg against Carlisle United, and he was substituted late in the second half by Luciano Becchio.
Grella's fifth goal of the season for Leeds came in Football League Trophy Northern Area Final second leg against Carlisle United. With Grella coming on as a second half substitute and scoring the late winner to send the tie to penalties, one of which Grella converted in the shootout, but Leeds ended up crashing out of the tournament after losing 6–5 on penalties. After coming on as a first half substitute against Norwich City, Grella was given a start against Swindon Town after Luciano Becchio's head injury ruled him out. Grella dropped back onto the bench for the rest of the season, and was limited to late substitute appearances. Leeds were promoted as League 1 runners up after beating Bristol Rovers. Over the course of the season Grella was unable to break up the 48 goal partnership that consisted of Jermaine Beckford and Luciano Becchio and had to settle for a role mainly as a substitute.
2010–11 season.
He made his first appearance in The Championship when he came on in the opening fixture as a second half substitute in the loss to Derby County and remained on Leeds' bench as an unused substitute in the opening fixtures. After the arrival of Ross McCormack and the emergence of Davide Somma saw Grella dropped down the pecking order at Leeds, Grella was set to go out on loan in order to gain some more first team experience, on transfer deadline day he turned down a loan move to League Two side Oxford United. To help maintain match fitness, Grella played 90 minutes in Leeds' 3–1 behind closed doors friendly win against Middlesbrough on 14 September, scoring a brace in the process. On 22 September 2010, Grella turned down the opportunity of joining Bradford City on loan. Simon Grayson revealed his disappointment that Grella turned down the loan move as he wanted him to get a regular run of games out on loan.
Carlisle United and Swindon Town loan spells.
On 12 October 2010, Grella joined Carlisle United on a month's loan to gain some more first team experience and gain regular football. He joined fellow Leeds loanee Ľubo Michalík who was already at the club. Grella made his debut as a second half substitute against Exeter City, he started the next game against Charlton, and scored his first goal for Carlisle against Charlton Athletic. He scored in his second consecutive game against Bristol Rovers. Leeds refused permission for Grella to play for Carlisle in the FA Cup against Tipton Town. After impressing during his first month at Carlisle, Grella's loan was extended to 1 January 2011, with Leeds including a 24 hour recall clause if he is needed. Carlisle had requested to loan Grella for the entire season but had that request turned down by Ken Bates. On 20 November, Grella scored his third goal for Carlisle against Walsall.
On 20 January 2011, Scottish Premier League side Motherwell announced they had signed Grella on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season. Grella returned to Leeds the following day, however, when it became clear that he could not play for Motherwell as he had already played for two different clubs (Leeds and Carlisle) earlier in the season.
On 24 February 2011, Grella agreed to join Swindon Town on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season. Grella scored his first goal for Swindon against Dagenham & Redbridge on 12 March. This spell ended on 12 April after Grella decided he was being overlooked since Paul Hart took charge, despite making five starts in seven games. He returned to Leeds but was unable to play for Leeds until his loan at Swindon had expired at the end of the season.
2011–12 season.
Leeds chairman, Ken Bates announced on 12 May that Grella was to be transfer listed by Leeds as he didn't figure in the clubs future plans.
On 8 June, Grella was given permission to train with American team New York Cosmos, the move is with a view to a permanent deal. However, Grella said whilst it was an interesting opportunity he was looking to stay at a club in England.

Olivier Clément

Olivier-Maurice Clément (November 17, 1921 – January 15, 2009) was an Orthodox Christian theologian, who taught at St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute in Paris, France. He actively promoted the reunification of Christians (he was friends with Pope John Paul II), dialogue between Christians and people of other beliefs, and the engagement of Christian thinkers with modern thought and society.
Biography.
Olivier-Maurice Clement was born on 17 November 1921, into an agnostic family from the Cevennes.
He became a follower of Jesus Christ at the age of thirty, after a long search in atheism and in Asian spiritualities. He had discovered, through reading the Christian philosophers Nicholas Berdyaev and Vladimir Lossky (of whom he would become a student and a friend), the thinking of the Fathers of the ancient, undivided Church, and he received baptism in the Orthodox Church, within the French-speaking diocese of the Moscow Patriarchate in Paris. He described his childhood, spiritual wanderings and conversion in his autobiography, "L'Autre Soleil" (The Other Sun) (ed. Stock 1986).
As a history professor, he taught at the Louis-le-Grand lyceum in Paris for a long time. As a professor of the St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute (Institut Saint-Serge) he became one of the most highly regarded witnesses to Orthodox Christianity, as well as one of the most prolific. He was a founder of the Orthodox Fellowship in Western Europe, and was the author of thirty books on the life, thought and history history of the Orthodox Church, and their meeting with other Christians, the non-Christian religions and modernity. He was responsible for the theological journal, "Contacts", and became a Doctor honoris causa at the Institute for theology in Bucharest and at the Catholic University in Louvain.
Within the scope of his teaching activities, Oliver Clement was particularly engaged in the life and testimony of the Orthodox Church in France. He also inspired the work of the Orthodox Fellowship in Western Europe from its founding in the early 1960s and participated in Orthodox Christian conferences in western Europe from 1971, when every third year Orthodox Christians from the four corners the continent would meet to pray and reflect together.
Among contemporary Orthodox theologians he was one who gave most attention to questions of modernity; which he sought to answer through a powerful and poetic reflection, rooted in the tradition of the Church as well as creative and renewing. He was an interlocutor with several great spiritual leaders of his time - Saint Sophrony of Maldon monastery in Britain, Patriarch Athenagoras, Pope John Paul II, theologian Dumitru Staniloae, Brother Roger of Taizé, Andrea Riccardi, founder of the Sant'Egidio community - with all of whom he formed a relationship of trust and friendship.
He died on 15 January 2009.

Salesian Secondary College

Salesian Secondary College, formerly Copsewood College, is a secondary school located outside the village of Pallaskenry, County Limerick, Ireland. The school campus is owned by the Salesians and shared with Pallaskenry Agricultural College. There are approximately 500 students enrolled in the schools co-educational program. The principal is Mr. Paddy O Neill. 
The school's webpage describes its mission as providing an education "based on Christian/Catholic values" while incorporating "the characteristics of Salesian Education". The basis of that pedagogy is the Salesian Preventive System, which is based on the experience of the 19th Century Saint John Bosco. 
Curriculum.
Salesian Secondary College's curriculum comprises six-year post primary education, with a three-year junior cycle to the Junior Certificate and a three-years senior cycle to the Leaving Certificate.
History and facilities.
Local legend describes that Copsewood was named in the 19th Century for Fr. Michael Copps, who lived in the house. The Salesians first took possession of Copsewood House in 1919. The boys-only missionary school opened in 1920 with 100 students, 80 of them boarders. The Agricultural School opened the same year. Many of the early students were involved in "The Troubles" and sought daytime refuge in the school by enrolling. In 1948 the missionary school was recognized by the Department of Education as a secondary school and began to receive government funding for teacher salaries. The school open to day-pupils. By 1957 missionary students had been phased out. The diocese permitted the school to become a secondary school, without missionary programs, to serve as a feeder school for the Agricultural College. The school offered subjects such as Technical Drawing, Woodwork, Metalwork, Physics, Chemistry, Botany, and Economics which were not then common in many schools at that time and were seen as an important grounding for agricultural students. From this came the development of the school's well-equipped science labs in the 1950s and 1960s. Boarding was phased out and ended in 1995, with the dormitory space converted into classrooms. The secondary school is now recognized as a regional leader in Information Technology. In 1972 the school hired its first female teacher and accepted its first female students.
The school facilities include 3 science labs, a computer lab, a woodwork room, a home economics room, a canteen, a sports hall, a swimming pool and a number of other sporting facilities, including pitches and handball alleys.
Fingerprinting.
In 2009 the school introduced an electronic fingerprinting system to assist with daily attendance and monitor absenteeism. This action gained national attention and the government's Data Protection Commission launched an investigation.

Dartford.
McDonald continued to turn out for Valley Swifts even after his move from Witham to Maldon Town in July 2008, before signing for Isthmian League Premier Division side Dartford in October 2008. Dartford put a stop to his Sunday League exploits and in his short 4 month stay at Princes Park he made 20 appearances scoring 19 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick against Canvey Island on 30 December 2008. It was form such as this which attracted interest from higher league clubs such as Norwich and reportedly Crystal Palace, Charlton Athletic and Reading.
On 26 January 2009, McDonald was accompanied by Dartford manager Tony Burman to Norwich City's training ground at Colney for a two day trial at the club and "the Darts"' boss later commented that "he (McDonald) enjoyed the experience and in my opinion did not look out of place over the two days".

His first appearance for the club came three weeks later in the reserves' 3–0 win over Great Yarmouth Town, in which he scored the third goal. He made his professional first team debut on 10 March 2009, as a substitute against Cardiff City at Carrow Road and scored in injury time. In a League Cup tie against Sunderland on 24 August 2009, McDonald played as a goalkeeper for the final few minutes as Norwich had had a player sent off, goalkeeper Ben Alnwick injured and had used all available substitutions. Commenting after the match on organising his defence, he admitted; "If I'm being honest I didn't really know what I was doing!". McDonald signed a new two-year deal with the club in March 2010. In the 2009–10 season he helped Norwich to the League One title, having been mainly used as an impact substitute.

In Triberg, at the bottom of the falls, the deep valley forms a basin just wide enough for a small town. The steep basin and the waterfalls were initially formed by two faults in the granite and then by glaciers during several glaciations of the Pleistocene.

<doc id="21365639" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21365639" title="Ifield Water Mill">
Ifield Water Mill

Ifield Water Mill is a 19th-century weatherboarded watermill in the Ifield neighbourhood of Crawley, a town and borough in West Sussex, England. Built on the site of an earlier, smaller flour mill, which itself replaced an iron forge—one of many in the Crawley area—it fell into disuse in the 1930s. The local council, which acquired the land for housing development in the 1970s, leased the mill to local enthusiasts, who restored it to working order. The mill and an associated house are listed buildings, and there is also a cottage (not listed) on the site.
History of the site.
The area around Ifield was originally thickly wooded, forming part of St Leonard's Forest. Small brooks and tributaries of the River Mole run through the soil, which is an area of Weald clay between the sandier soil to the south and a narrow outcrop of limestone further north. At least one mill had been established in the village by the 13th century, although this was further north. No records of its ownership survive, but tithe documents refer to it several times and it may have belonged to the Lord of the Manor.
An iron forge existed on the site by the late 16th century. The Lord of the Manor owned the section of Ifield Brook (a tributary of the Mole) which ran from the furnace at nearby Bewbush, to the southwest. The brook was dammed in the 16th century to form a mill pond, which provided power for the forge. By 1606, "a house, barn, mill, mill pond and two crofts of land known as Ifield Mill and Ifield Mill Pond" had been established. The Middletons, a rich local family who owned many ironworks across Sussex, leased the mill and its associated buildings. They were also tenants of the Bewbush furnace.
The Sussex iron industry declined quickly in the mid-17th century. Bewbush furnace closed in 1642 because the area had been completely deforested and there was no more wood to use for fuel; the following year, as the English Civil War raged, Parliamentarians overran the area and destroyed all remnants of the industry. The site of Ifield forge was cleared, and a corn mill was built in its place. (At the time, the generic name "mill" was used to describe forges, and their operators were called "millers" or "farmers". This makes it difficult to determine exactly when the change happened.) It was definitely operating by 1660, when a local Quaker, William Garton, operated it. He was regularly imprisoned for his religious beliefs over the next 25 years, even though Ifield was a hotbed of Nonconformism (being the site of one of the first Quaker meeting houses in the world).
The mill was a small-scale operation at first, but as the milling process became more efficient it was able to expand. It was rebuilt in 1683. The Middleton family owned the mill and its associated buildings outright by this time; another prosperous local businessman, Leonard Gale, bought it in 1715. By 1759 it had passed out of his family and began a 50-year period in which various combinations of partners owned it. By this time it was the largest corn mill in the area; when Napoleon threatened to invade the United Kingdom, a survey was undertaken to determine the output of all mills, which found that Ifield Mill could supply 16 sacks of flour and 120 loaves of bread each day. Other local mills could manage no more than four sacks per day.
Despite its efficient output, the mill fell into disuse in the 1810s after London-based businessman Abraham Goldsmid bought it in 1809. It lay unused for eight years until Thomas Durrant, a miller from nearby Merstham, bought it for £1,200 in 1817. Durrant was the first owner who also acted as miller, and under his ownership the mill was completely rebuilt.
Reconstruction.
The 1683 building was demolished and the structure which stands today was built in its place. A decorative stone tablet with the date 1683 and the initials of Thomas Middleton and his wife Mary was salvaged and mounted on the exterior. (Middleton was the owner at the time of the 1683 rebuilding.) Thomas Durrant spent £3,500 on construction. This money came from successful litigation against a group of miners whose actions damaged the water supply to his mill at Merstham and rendered it useless; a similar problem started to affect the Ifield mill soon after it was rebuilt. The water supply began to fail as the brook's flow became weaker, and in 1848 the mill pond was cut in half by the building of the railway line to Horsham. This originally crossed it on a bridge, but an embankment soon replaced it. Also, in 1837, a competing windmill had been built near the centre of the village, and two other millers were recorded in Ifield parish by 1821. Gradual decline continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries; the mill passed through many owners, and even one long-established family of owner-millers, the Hardings, struggled. A steam engine driven by a waterwheel had been installed, but the engine often had to be worked manually because the water power was so feeble. The mill was no longer in use by 1927, and it was put up for sale with the adjacent Mill Cottage in 1934. Described as "a gentleman's residence with a picturesque disused water mill", it was clear that the mill's importance had ebbed away.
Restoration.
The mill stood unused, apart from for storage, and nominally for sale until Crawley Borough Council used a compulsory purchase order to buy it in 1974. The council was acquiring land on the edge of Ifield for housing. It allowed a group of volunteers to attempt to restore the mill, which was in poor structural condition. Work started on 15 June 1974.
All parts of the structure were affected by the neglect and long period of disuse. Trees had invaded the building, dislodging the roof; the main timbers holding the building up were rotting and needed replacement; a retaining wall had collapsed inwards; and the water wheel, while still sound, was embedded in the mud. The work took eight years—much longer than the original estimate of three, although large donations of money paid for many interior fittings which had not been taken into account. Three staircases, the board cladding on the inside walls and the wooden floors were all renewed, and all windows were refitted to their original design. On the exterior, the weatherboarding was removed and a layer of waterproof cladding installed. Much of the boardwork had to be replaced, although the original appearance was preserved. The roof was also repaired inside and out to prevent it decaying any further.
Replacing the load-bearing timbers and supports was particularly difficult. The whole building had to be lifted with hydraulic jacks and suspended aloft temporarily while new timbers were installed. Work on the water wheel and its surrounding brick structure was also difficult and took several years. Parts of the wheel were salvaged and incorporated into the rebuilt oak and steel structure. The walls supporting it were totally rebuilt at the same time. A sluice gate was built across the mill pond, and a flow control mechanism was brought in from the disused Hammonds Mill in Burgess Hill, also in West Sussex. The wheel is of the overshot type—the largest such wheel in Sussex—weighs around , has a diameter of and can rotate at between 8 and 15 revolutions per minute depending on water flow.
Despite its scale and the difficulty of many of the tasks, the restoration was carried out almost entirely by volunteers working mostly at weekends. Some unemployed people enrolled in a job creation programme were briefly used, but no professional engineers, construction personnel or other qualified workers were employed at any time during the eight-year process. The wooden parts of the waterwheel in this reconstruction rotted after about 30 years, so with some financial help from the Lottery Heritage Fund a new waterwheel was constructed in steel.
Efforts have been made to improve the ecological and wildlife balance of the mill pond and the surrounding area. The northern part of the pond had to be drained in 1976 during the reconstruction work, and trees started to become established in the bed; the part south of the railway line, meanwhile, was described as a "virtual desert" ecologically. By 1979, however, it had been restocked with more than 30,000 fish, and birds quickly became established again: a study recorded 58 species. The soil is considered to be of good quality, which improves the chances of suitable vegetation becoming established.
Architecture.
Ifield Water Mill is a tall, externally weatherboarded structure of three storeys, consisting of a brick-built ground floor and two gabled upper floors of timber. The slate roof has eaves carried out beyond the walls on brackets. The mill hoist, whose surrounding timberwork and brickwork was found to be very badly corroded during the restoration, projects from the north face.
Current activities.
Ifield Water Mill was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 21 June 1948. It is one of 79 Grade II structures, and 100 listed buildings of all grades, in the Borough of Crawley. The Borough Council still own the building, but it is leased to Crawley Museum Society. Before Crawley Museum was established in Goffs Park in the Southgate neighbourhood, a temporary museum and exhibition was housed in the mill.
The mill house and cottage were also bought by the council as part of their land acquisition programme, and have been leased to private tenants since then. The mill house, a 16th-century half-timbered building with modern additions in brick, is now a public house. It has an original tiled hipped roof, but much of the building was remodelled in the 20th century in the style of the old structure. It was listed at Grade II on 1 May 1974. The cottage is not listed separately by English Heritage. It was built in the 16th or 17th century as a barn, but was converted to residential use in the 1930s.

Open building

John Habraken first articulated the principles of open building in his book "Supports: An Alternative to Mass Housing", published in Dutch in 1961 and in English in 1972 and 1999, and in many other languages. He argued that housing must always recognize two domains of action–the action of the community and that of the individual inhabitant. When the inhabitant is excluded, the result is uniformity and rigidity. When only the individual takes action, the result may be chaos and conflict. This formulation of a necessary balance of control had implications for all parties in the housing process, including architects. A research foundation was established in 1965 at the SAR (Stichting Architecten Research) in Eindhoven, the Netherlands to explore the ramifications, for architects, of the views laid out in that book. Habraken was invited to be Director of the SAR. Later, in the 1980s, a research group (OBOM) was formed at TU Delft under the direction of Professor Age van Randen, the goal of which was to study the practical issues of implementing the ideas in practice.
From the late 1960s onward, a number of pioneering projects were completed in the Netherlands, the UK, Japan and elsewhere. This history is recounted in part in "Housing for the Millions: John Habraken and the SAR" (1960–2000). Frans van der Werf, a Dutch architect, was one of the early pioneers. A number of other books have been published specifically on the subject, dozens of technical reports have been produced in several languages, open building is referred to in countless books, scholarly papers, dissertations, and articles in professional journals, and in-depth country reports and studies have emerged in Finland, the Netherlands, the USA and Japan. "Residential Open Building" was published in 2000, telling in more detail about the pioneering projects and the principles underlying their implementation. This book has been translated into Japanese.
Widespread interest in these concepts and their practical implementation led to the formation of an international commission. This group was formed in 1996, under the auspices of the CIB (International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction). Members of the CIB W104 come from many countries including the USA, the Netherlands, the UK, Finland, France, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa.
This commission’s original purpose was twofold. First, it intended to document developments toward open building internationally. Second, it intended to stimulate implementation efforts by disseminating information and by convening international conferences at which government and university researchers, practitioners and others could exchange information and support local initiatives. These activities focused largely on the technical and methodological aspects of residential open building. There were continuing exchanges between colleagues in the less developed countries and developed countries, but the dominant focus was the latter.
Between 1996 and 2008, the commission met 14 times, in Delft, Tokyo, Taipei, Washington, DC, Mexico City, Brighton (UK), Helsinki, Paris, Hong Kong, and Muncie, Indiana (USA), on a few occasions with other CIB Commissions, and at several of the triennial CIB World Congresses. The most recent conference in the US (2008) focused on education, and included an international student competition, with winners from Korea, China, Singapore and the USA. Each conference has produced a published book of proceedings, containing a total now of over 300 peer-reviewed papers.
State-of-the-Art.
Since the turn of the 21st century, a number of developments in various countries indicate that open building is no longer a speculative idea of a few pioneer practitioners and theorists. It has or is poised to become mainstream.
Shopping centers and office buildings are recognized as exhibiting the characteristics of open building. An architect, working for a developer, will design a base building that defines public space and common services, leaving space for individual stores or offices, which hire their own architect to fill in their leased space. It appears that no theoretical or methodological work preceded the coming of age of this kind of architecture. The first appearance and subsequent evolution of shopping centers and office buildings progressed pragmatically, as a response to new realities, led by real estate developers and business entities of all kinds. Architects and contractors learned how to provide the needed services, often producing work of exceptional quality. Product manufacturers and their supply chains began introducing suitable products, fabrication and construction methods. New standards and regulations were developed to match the new realities. These developments were international in scope, crossing economic, political, cultural and technical boundaries.
Aside from these two building types, many parties–public and private - now ask for residential open building on a regular basis. This is evident in Finland, Poland, Japan, and the Netherlands. In other countries, residential open building–known by many names–is no longer recognized as something unusual. Evidence of this is found in Russia, Switzerland, Germany, China and to a lesser extent in the United States. New examples of housing in less-developed economies, designed by professionals to be incrementally upgraded in a user-controlled process, come to light in Chile, Mexico, and South Africa.
Mainstreaming of open building is a response to the pressures, conflicts and waste caused by continued adherence to rigid functionalism–that is, defining functions and designing buildings to fit. Open building is also a pragmatic answer to a state of technical entanglement in buildings that has resulted from the incremental addition, over a long period of time, of new technical systems and the “ownership” of these new systems by different trades who rarely cooperate. These pressures are forcing all parties to reconsider and realign their procurement and investment practices, their design methods, and their regulatory systems. In mass-consumer societies, attitudes toward the sphere of control exercised by inhabitants in the making and transformation of environments are changing, vis-à-vis the role of large corporations, governments and communities. The idea that investments should consider long-term asset value is also forcing all parties to learn to make buildings–especially but not limited to multi-occupant buildings - that can adjust as technologies, social patterns, and preferences–both individual and community–continue to evolve.
These changes in attitude and priorities are taking the force of law. In part this can be explained by the widespread–and parallel - adoption of a sustainability agenda. In 2008 the Japanese parliament passed new laws mandating 200 year housing, accompanying the legislation with a set of regulatory and administrative tools for use by local building officials who have the responsibility to evaluate and approve building projects. Projects approved under the new law receive a reduced rate of taxation. In Finland, one of the largest real estate companies develops open building projects for their residential portfolio. In the Netherlands, a number of companies–from product manufacturers to developers to architects–implement open building by other names. In Warsaw, Poland, open building is known as the “Warsaw Standard”. In San Francisco, residential developers build “bulk” housing, ready to be fitted out individually. Around the world, old office buildings that have retained their social and economic value are converted to residential occupancy, after being “gutted” to prepare them for new uses and layouts.
Besides shopping centers, office buildings and housing, open building is also evident in the health care facilities sector in the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, among other countries. Hospital clients can no longer afford to let short-term functional programs drive facilities procurement methods and investment decisions. They demand “change-ready” facilities, assessed by their accommodation capacity over time, rather than short-term functional performance.
These projects, often large and complex and providing mixed-use space for housing, offices, commerce, health care and other uses - are recognized as having the systemic properties of large private (or public) infrastructures. They involve many decision-making bodies and users over long time periods and often implicate numerous territories. As such, they present technical, economic, political and cultural questions that go beyond the architectural discourse that tends to emphasize the special case, formal gymnastics, and the self-expression of the designer or client. These developments toward open building are not taking place for their ideological purity but for pragmatic reasons.
Open building implementation implies a new approach to architectural education. A number of schools of architecture around the world (TU Delft, Ball State University in the US, The University of Hong Kong, Southeast University in China, National Cheng-kung University in Taiwan, Shibaura Institute of Technology in Tokyo, University of Florence, University of Pretoria, among others) are experimenting with it. Because open building rejects functionalism, educators who teach open building help students develop skills in making built form, at various levels of intervention that can accommodate changing function.
Open building implementation also implies new business models for the delivery of fit-out as integrated design-build packages, serving the consumer market. These companies, now operating in Finland, the Netherlands and Japan, operate with advanced IT support, advanced logistics, and showrooms with electronic and physical samples of products, and with trained installers.
Open Building Terminology.
Levels: specific spheres of control in the built environment. The built environment can be seen as having an hierarchical structure in which higher levels serve as the setting and context in which lower levels operate. As such, higher levels exercise "dominance" over lower levels, while lower levels are "dependant" on higher-level structures. Examples of levels include urban design and architecture, or base building and fit-out.
Base building: the part of a multi-tenant building that directly serves and affects all occupants. In conventional North American practice, base buildings are constructed by speculative office building developers, leaving choice and responsibility for the reminder of the building–the fit-out - to occupants. The base building normally includes the building's primary structure; the building envelope (roof and facade) in whole or part; public circulation and fire egress(lobbies, corridors, elevators and public stairs); and primary mechanical and supply systems (electricity, heating and air conditioning, telephone, water supply, drainage, gas, etc.) up to the point of contact with individual occupant spaces. Base buildings provide serviced space for occupancy; Supports is another term for base building.
Fit-out (tenant work): the physical products and spaces controlled by the individual inhabitant or occupant used to make habitable space in a base building. Fit-out can change without forcing the base building to change.
Capacity: the measurable quality of a base building to accommodate a range of variations in floor plan and use within the constraints of a given base building. More generally, capacity concerns the degree of Open Building freedom offered by a higher level to a lower level.

English Opens Doors Program

English Opens Doors (Spanish language: Inglés Abre Puertas ) is an initiative of the Chilean Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) to apply technical expertise and improve English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching, making it more accessible to Chilean people. The English Opens Doors program was launched in 2003 and was supported by former President Michelle Bachelet and Minister of Education Mónica Jiménez.
Activities.
National Volunteer Center.
Sponsored by the United Nations Development Program and the English Opens Doors Program (EODP) of the Ministry of Education, the National Volunteer Center seeks highly motivated native and near-native English speakers to work as English teaching assistants in public and semi-private schools throughout Chile. The National Volunteer Center runs a fee-free volunteer program:
Volunteer Program 
Volunteers devote 25 hours each week to in-classroom teaching and an additional 10 to lesson planning and designing or supporting extracurricular activities. Volunteers also receive accommodations and basic meals provided through a host family, a volunteer bonus to offset teaching related costs, in-country health insurance, a TEFL and Chilean culture orientation (with accommodations and meals provided), an E-learning Spanish course, in-country transportation to placement sites from Santiago, and in-country support. Volunteers participate in many English Opens Doors Program initiatives, such as English summer and winter camps, debates, public speaking, and spelling bees. Volunteers are placed throughout Chile and pay no fee to participate in the program. 
Since 2004, 1,822 English-speaking volunteers have been assigned to schools in every region of Chile, including the islands of Rapa Nui, Chiloe, and more. 650 municipal and subsidized establishments have benefited from the program.
The National Volunteer Center has announced program dates for the 2014 school year:
English summer and winter camps.
Total immersion English camps take place during students' summer and winter vacations. Camps are designed to give talented Chilean public high school students the chance to practice English in a more hands on way through interactive activities including role-playing exercises, field trips, group projects, and competitive games.
Debate, public speaking and spelling bee competitions.
Each year, the English Opens Doors Program sponsors debate competitions for high school students, public speaking competitions for 7th and 8th grade students, and spelling bee competitions for 5th and 6th grade students. Students are expected to prepare and present material entirely in English and to compete at local and regional events in order to advance to the national finals, held in Santiago. Fernanda Gallardo from Colegio Ramón Barros Luco brought home first prize in Public Speaking.
Scholarships.
In 2006, President Bachelet officially announced a government-funded scholarship for undergraduates pursuing an EFL teaching degree at private and public accredited Chilean universities. This scholarship has now been incorporated into Sistema Bicentenario BECAS Chile. The main objective is the creation of a long-term, comprehensive policy for professional and academic development abroad. The scholarship enables Chilean undergraduates in their penultimate year of university to improve their English-language skills and become familiar with a foreign culture. It is the only scholarship the Chilean government grants to undergraduate students and is designed to provide Chilean schools with high-quality professionals, thereby improving English-language education. 
The destination country must be one in which English is either an official language or is used widely enough that the Chilean student will be experiencing total immersion. All scholarship applicants undergo a rigorous selection process that includes taking an English-language proficiency test such as the TOEFL or IELTS.
Professional development for EFL teachers.
In order to improve the level of English-language learning among elementary and high school students, the English Opens Doors Program has developed several strategies to provide EFL teachers in public schools with more professional development opportunities, helping them to improve their English-language fluency and teaching practices:
Mandarin Chinese teaching program.
In 2005, just prior to the China-Chile free trade agreement the Ministry of Education developed a program that allows educators to incorporate Mandarin Chinese into the curriculum, which is also formally managed by the English Opens Doors Program. Native Chinese speaking trained teachers spend up to two years at a public or semi-private Chilean school teaching Chinese as a foreign language and developing initiatives such as dialogues and immersion camps.

Freeze stat

Freeze Stat.
A freeze stat is a temperature sensing device for HVAC that monitors a heat exchanger to prevent its coils from freezing. Freeze stats can be used on both freon-to-air, and freon-to-liquid type heat exchangers and serve different purposes with similar goals for each.
Water coil freeze stats.
The water coil freeze stat performs a similar function to the air coil freeze stat, but is used on a different type of HVAC system. Its function is to keep the freon-to-liquid heat exchanger (commonly called "liquid coils") from freezing.
In practical situations, when an air coil freeze stat is not used, bypassed, or defeated, the air coil can freeze, and this causes a lack of air flow to the facility. By contrast, when a water coil freeze stat is not used, the water coil can get so cold that it can freeze the cooling liquid in the exchanger and burst the exchanger. A ruptured heat exchanger mixes contaminants such as freon and oil into the coolant. The intrusion of coolant into the delicately balanced refrigeration system can cause expensive damage to components such as the freon compressor, and the reversing valve.
Mechanical Freeze Stats.
, mechanical freeze stats are constructed with a diaphragm, a capillary tube and bulb, and an electric switch. The capillary tube allows gas movement to and from the capillary bulb and the diaphragm with a fall or rise in temperature, respectively. When the temperature reaches a specific setpoint, the pressure in the diaphragm will trip a switch which typically shuts down the flow of outside air while the capillary bulb's temperature is at or below the setpoint. Mechanical freeze stats can have more than one set of contacts, and the contacts can be NO or NC.
Disadvantages
Advantages
Digital Freeze Stats.
Digital freeze stats, also known as "electronic" or "solid state" freeze stats, use an electronic circuit, microprocessor, or microcontroller in place of the mechanical freeze stat's diaphragm and switch. They also use one or more electric or electronic sensors in place of the capillary tube and bulb for temperature sensing. Digital freeze stats utilizing microcontrollers or microprocessors can also perform more advanced functions than simply opening or closing switch contacts. Digital freeze stats can perform seeminly intelligent operations such as reversing the refrigerant flow and using some building heat to thaw a freon-to-liquid heat exchanger and then restoring the refrigerant flow to its normal direction once the danger of freezing the water coil has been averted.

"SoBeautiful" is the third single from Musiq Soulchild's fifth studio album, "OnMyRadio". It was sent to US radio stations for airplay consideration in January 2009. It was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.
Background.
In an interview with HitQuarters, producer and co-writer JR Hutson described the genesis of the song,
"We’d done a couple of other ideas just off the cuff ... and then as he was leaving I started playing those four chords that are in the beginning of the song. He put his bag down and began commenting on what I was playing. I then started building the track, and he started writing the song - a couple of hours later we had the basic skeleton to the record."

Cornish Constitutional Convention

The Cornish Constitutional Convention (CCC; ) was formed in November 2000 with the objective of establishing a devolved Cornish Assembly (Senedh Kernow). The Convention is a cross-party, cross-sector association with a strong consensus of support both in Cornwall and elsewhere. It is not campaigning for any form of separatism or independence.
The Convention had been meeting for some time prior to November 2000 as an informal discussion group. In less than two years, it had attracted the signatures of "about 50,000" people on a petition calling for a referendum on a Cornish Assembly, which is a little over 10% of the total Cornish electorate. A delegation led by the West Cornwall Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) Andrew George and representatives of the Convention, (Richard Ford, Dick Cole, David Fieldsend and Andrew Climo) presented the declaration to 10 Downing Street on Wednesday 12 December 2001.
Position.
According to the 2001 petition, "We, the People of Cornwall, must have a greater say in how we are governed. We need a Cornish Assembly that can set the right democratic priorities for Cornwall and provide a stronger voice for our communities in Britain, in Europe and throughout the wider world." In this, the Cornish Constitutional Convention sits within the milieu of increased desire for greater automony by European regions. Given Cornwall's geographical peripherality, economic status, cultural and linguistic circumstances it is unsurprising that Cornwall has a devolutionary movement.
Unlike the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which had the support of much of the political establishment of Scotland including formal membership of political parties, churches and civic groups, the CCC is more akin to the Scottish Convention's predecessor, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly.
History.
Formed in November 2000, the Convention states that its key objectives are to:
Among its publications are "Devolution for One and All: Governance for Cornwall in the 21st Century", "The Case for Cornwall: Cornwall's response to the Government's Devolution White Paper", "Devolution for One and All: Cornwall Devolution for Prosperity", and "Devolution's Future: A New Proposal for Regional Devolution".
Current activities.
The Convention presently appears to be taking a 'wait and see' approach to developments. The bid for regional status for Cornwall having been overtaken for the time being by Cornwall County Council's bid for Unitary Council status.
However, the vote taken by County Councillors was subject to parts of the regional agenda being retained, not least the creation of a strategic "Cornish Development Agency" with strategic economic and spatial planning powers. The challenge will be for the Convention and others to ensure that this project is not watered down, thus losing the 'direct line' to London that is the main thrust of this project.

Lady Justice

Lady Justice (, the Roman goddess of Justice, who is equivalent to the Greek goddesses Themis and Dike) is an allegorical personification of the moral force in judicial systems.
Depiction.
The personification of justice balancing the scales dates back to the Goddess Maat, and later Isis, of ancient Egypt. The Hellenic deities Themis and Dike were later goddesses of justice. Themis was the embodiment of divine order, law, and custom, in her aspect as the personification of the divine rightness of law. However, a more direct connection is to Themis' daughter Dike, who was portrayed carrying scales.
"If some god had been holding level the balance of Dike" is a surviving fragment of Bacchylides' poetry. Ancient Rome adopted the image of a female goddess of justice, which it called Iustitia. Since Roman times, Iustitia has frequently been depicted carrying scales and a sword, and wearing a blindfold. Her modern iconography frequently adorns courthouses and courtrooms, and conflates the attributes of several goddesses who embodied Right Rule for Greeks and Romans, blending Roman blindfolded Fortuna (fate) with Hellenistic Greek Tyche (luck), and sword-carrying Nemesis (vengeance).
Lady Justice is most often depicted with a set of scales typically suspended from her right hand, upon which she measures the strengths of a case's support and opposition. She is also often seen carrying a double-edged sword in her left hand, symbolizing the power of Reason and Justice, which may be wielded either for or against any party.
Blindfold.
Since the 15th century, Lady Justice has often been depicted wearing a blindfold. The blindfold represents objectivity, in that justice is or should be meted out objectively, without fear or favour, regardless of identity, money, power, or weakness; blind justice and impartiality. The earliest Roman coins depicted Justitia with the sword in one hand and the scale in the other, but with her eyes uncovered. Justitia was only commonly represented as "blind" since about the end of the 15th century. The first known representation of blind Justice is Hans Gieng's 1543 statue on the "Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen" (Fountain of Justice) in Berne.
Instead of using the Janus approach, many sculptures simply leave out the blindfold altogether. For example, atop the Old Bailey courthouse in London, a statue of Lady Justice stands without a blindfold; the courthouse brochures explain that this is because Lady Justice was originally not blindfolded, and because her “maidenly form” is supposed to guarantee her impartiality which renders the blindfold redundant. Another variation is to depict a blindfolded Lady Justice as a human scale, weighing competing claims in each hand. An example of this can be seen at the Shelby County Courthouse in Memphis, Tennessee.
The cover of a 2006 issue of "Rolling Stone" proclaimed TIME TO GO!, focusing on the perceived corruption that dominated Congress. The drawing showed a bunch of figures evoking reactionary politics emerging from the Capitol Building. One of the figures was Lady Justice lifting her blindfold, implying that the then-composition of Congress had politicized the criminal justice system.

Rex Partington

Rex Partington (March 15, 1924 - March 17, 2006) was an actor, director and producer. Partington worked in the professional theater in the United States for over fifty years as an actor, production stage manager, director, producer, artistic director and producing director and was active on Broadway as well as professional regional theater. He was instrumental in the establishment of the League of Resident Theatres and played a vital role in the development of regional theater.
Career.
A graduate of Syracuse University, Partington's initial focus was acting, appearing in leading roles throughout college and then in regional theater. Several seasons of leading roles at the Memphis Arena Theater and the Barter Theater as well as regional tours followed and on December 15, 1954 he made his Broadway debut opposite the great actor/singer Dennis King in "Lunatics and Lovers".
Following "Lunatics and Lovers", Partington began dividing his time between acting and stage management. His work as a stage manager brought him opportunities to work with such theatrical luminaries as Thorton Wilder, Moss Hart, David Merrick, Jed Harris, and Tyrone Guthrie.
After stage managing the original Broadway productions of "The Matchmaker", "The First Gentlemen", "Child of Fortune", and "My Fair Lady", Partington had the opportunity to work with Orson Welles, Douglas Campbell and Rod Steiger, as both an actor and stage manager, in Welles' theatrical adaptation of the Herman Melville classic, "Moby Dick", entitled "Moby Dick—Rehearsed". Though not a critical success, "Moby Dick—Rehearsed" is, to this day, considered a great theatrical adaptation and an idiomatic example of Theatrical Minimalism.
In December 1962, Partington was contacted by Tyrone Guthrie and asked to join the newly founded Tyrone Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota as its first production manager. It was in this capacity that Partington served for the next five years. It was an historic time for American theater and it was during this period that the League Of Resident Theaters was established and saw unprecedented growth.
In 1968, Partington left the Guthrie and established his own theatrical company, Heartland Productions. Based out of the newly opened Southwest Minnesota State College in Marshall, Minnesota, Heartland Productions was a professional Equity company whose focus was both theatrical classics as well as new dramatic works. Additionally, the company toured throughout the mid-west bringing live professional theater to rural areas. Heartland Productions enjoyed two successful seasons until underwriting was withdrawn and the company was forced to disband.
In 1970, Partington assumed the artistic leadership of the Cleveland Play House but that was a short-lived, for early in 1971, his friend and colleague Robert Porterfield, founder of the Barter Theater asked him to come to Virginia and take over artistic responsibilities for the world famous Barter. Porterfield's health was failing and following his death in October 1971, Partington was officially named Producing Artistic Director of the Barter Theater. For the next twenty years, under Partington's leadership, the Barter Theater continued its legacy as America's oldest professional theater.
In 1992, Partington retired as Producing Artistic Director of the Barter Theater and he and his wife, actress Cleo Holladay moved to the Mexican Gulf coastal town of Apalachicola, Florida. There, Partington purchased and completely renovated the Dixie Theatre, a theater built in 1912. In 1998 the Dixie opened with professional Equity productions of "Sylvia" and "Driving Miss Daisy". Today the Dixie Theatre continues to present as well as produce professional theatrical works, concerts and multi-media presentations. It also has the distinction of being one of the few family owned theaters in the country.
Rex Partington was a longstanding member of both The Players Club and The Lambs Club.
Personal life.
Partington was born in Newark, New Jersey on March 15, 1924. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II as a paratrooper in the historic 101st Airborne Division. He saw action in Europe and following the end of the war was assigned to General Eisenhower's Elite Guard. He was married to actress Cleo Holladay on September 26, 1953. They had two children.
He died on March 17, 2006, in Panama City, Florida.

Cirrhosis

Cirrhosis (from Greek kirrhos [κιρρός] "yellowish" and the common Greek suffix -sis meaning "condition") is a result of advanced liver disease. It is characterized by replacement of liver tissue by fibrosis (scar tissue) and regenerative nodules (lumps that occur due to attempted repair of damaged tissue). These changes lead to loss of liver function. Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcoholism, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and fatty liver disease, but has many other possible causes. Some cases are idiopathic (of unknown cause).
Ascites (fluid retention in the abdominal cavity) is the most common complication of cirrhosis. It is associated with a poor quality of life, increased risk of infection, and a poor long-term outcome. Other potentially life-threatening complications are hepatic encephalopathy (confusion and coma) and bleeding from esophageal varices. Cirrhosis is irreversible, and treatment usually focuses on preventing progression and complications. In advanced stages of cirrhosis the only option is a liver transplant.
Signs and symptoms.
Cirrhosis has many possible manifestations. These signs and symptoms may be either as a direct result of the failure of liver cells or secondary to the resultant portal hypertension. There are also some manifestations whose causes are nonspecific but may occur in cirrhosis. Likewise, the absence of any does not rule out the possibility of cirrhosis.
Liver dysfunction.
The following features are as a direct consequence of liver cells not functioning. 
Portal hypertension.
Liver cirrhosis increases resistance to blood flow and higher pressure in the portal venous system, resulting in portal hypertension. Effects of portal hypertension include: 
Unestablished cause.
There are some changes seen in cirrhosis whose causes are not clearly known. They may also be a sign of other non-liver related causes. 
Advanced disease.
As the disease progresses, complications may develop. In some people, these may be the first signs of the disease.
Causes.
Cirrhosis has many possible causes; sometimes more than one cause is present in the same patient. Globally, 57% of cirrhosis is attributable to either Hepatitis B (30%) or Hepatitis C (27%). Alcohol consumption is another important cause, accounting for about 20% of the cases.
Pathophysiology.
The liver plays a vital role in synthesis of proteins (for example, albumin, clotting factors and complement), detoxification, and storage (for example, vitamin A). In addition, it participates in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates.
Cirrhosis is often preceded by hepatitis and fatty liver (steatosis), independent of the cause. If the cause is removed at this stage, the changes are still fully reversible.
The pathological hallmark of cirrhosis is the development of scar tissue that replaces normal parenchyma. This scar tissue blocks the portal flow of blood through the organ therefore disturbing normal function. Recent research shows the pivotal role of the stellate cell, a cell type that normally stores vitamin A, in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the hepatic parenchyma (due to inflammation) leads to activation of the stellate cell, which increases fibrosis (called myofibroblast) and obstructs blood flow in the circulation. In addition, it secretes TGF-β1, which leads to a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it secretes TIMP 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, which prevents them from breaking down fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.
The fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate hepatocyte nodules, which eventually replace the entire liver architecture, leading to decreased blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, which leads to hypersplenism and increased sequestration of platelets. Portal hypertension is responsible for most severe complications of cirrhosis.
Diagnosis.
The gold standard for diagnosis of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach. A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data suggests cirrhosis. Furthermore, there is a small but significant risk to liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications caused by liver biopsy. The best predictors of cirrhosis are ascites, platelet count <160,000/mm3, spider angiomata and Bonacini cirrhosis discriminant score greater than 7.
Lab findings.
The following findings are typical in cirrhosis:
There is now a validated and patented combination of 6 of these markers as non-invasive biomarker of fibrosis (and so of cirrhosis): FibroTest.
Other laboratory studies performed in newly diagnosed cirrhosis may include:
Imaging.
"Ultrasound" is routinely used in the evaluation of cirrhosis. It may show a small and nodular liver in advanced cirrhosis along with increased echogenicity with irregular appearing areas. Other findings suggestive of cirrhosis in imaging are an enlarged caudate lobe, widening of the liver fissures and enlargement of the spleen. An enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), which normally measures less than 11–12 cm in adults, is suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension in the right clinical setting. Ultrasound may also screen for hepatocellular carcinoma, portal hypertension, and Budd-Chiari syndrome (by assessing flow in the hepatic vein).
A new type of device, the FibroScan (transient elastography), uses elastic waves to determine liver stiffness which theoretically can be converted into a liver score based on the METAVIR scale. The FibroScan produces an ultrasound image of the liver (from 20–80 mm) along with a pressure reading (in kPa). The test is much faster than a biopsy (lasts 2.5–5 minutes) and is painless. It shows reasonable correlation with the severity of cirrhosis.
Other tests performed in particular circumstances include abdominal CT and liver/bile duct MRI (MRCP).
Endoscopy.
Gastroscopy (endoscopic examination of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) is performed in patients with established cirrhosis to exclude the possibility of esophageal varices. If these are found, prophylactic local therapy may be applied (sclerotherapy or banding) and beta blocker treatment may be commenced.
Rarely are diseases of the bile ducts, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, causes of cirrhosis. Imaging of the bile ducts, such as ERCP or MRCP (MRI of biliary tract and pancreas) may aid in the diagnosis.
Pathology.
Macroscopically, the liver is initially enlarged, but with progression of the disease, it becomes smaller. Its surface is irregular, the consistency is firm, and the color is often yellow (if associated steatosis). Depending on the size of the nodules there are three macroscopic types: micronodular, macronodular, and mixed cirrhosis. In micronodular form (Laennec's cirrhosis or portal cirrhosis) regenerating nodules are under 3 mm. In macronodular cirrhosis (post-necrotic cirrhosis), the nodules are larger than 3 mm. The mixed cirrhosis consists of nodules with different sizes.
However, cirrhosis is defined by its pathological features on microscopy: (1) the presence of regenerating nodules of hepatocytes and (2) the presence of fibrosis, or the deposition of connective tissue between these nodules. The pattern of fibrosis seen can depend upon the underlying insult that led to cirrhosis. Fibrosis can also proliferate even if the underlying process that caused it has resolved or ceased. The fibrosis in cirrhosis can lead to destruction of other normal tissues in the liver: including the sinusoids, the space of Disse, and other vascular structures, which leads to altered resistance to blood flow in the liver and portal hypertension.
As cirrhosis can be caused by many different entities which injure the liver in different ways, cause specific abnormalities may be seen. For example, in chronic hepatitis B, there is infiltration of the liver parenchyma with lymphocytes. In cardiac cirrhosis there are erythrocytes and a greater amount of fibrosis in the tissue surrounding the hepatic veins. In primary biliary cirrhosis, there is fibrosis around the bile duct, the presence of granulomas and pooling of bile. Lastly in alcoholic cirrhosis, there is infiltration of the liver with neutrophils.
Grading.
The severity of cirrhosis is commonly classified with the Child-Pugh score. This score uses bilirubin, albumin, INR, presence and severity of ascites, and encephalopathy to classify patients in class A, B, or C. Class A has a favourable prognosis, while class C is at high risk of death. It was devised in 1964 by Child and Turcotte and modified in 1973 by Pugh and others.
More modern scores, used in the allocation of liver transplants but also in other contexts, are the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and its pediatric counterpart, the Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score.
The hepatic venous pressure gradient, (difference in venous pressure between afferent and efferent blood to the liver) also determines severity of cirrhosis, although hard to measure. A value of 16 mm or more means a greatly increased risk of dying.
Management.
Generally, liver damage from cirrhosis cannot be reversed, but treatment could stop or delay further progression and reduce complications. A healthy diet is encouraged, as cirrhosis may be an energy-consuming process. Close follow-up is often necessary. Antibiotics are prescribed for infections, and various medications can help with itching. Laxatives, such as lactulose, decrease risk of constipation; their role in preventing encephalopathy is limited.
Alcoholic cirrhosis caused by alcohol abuse is treated by abstaining from alcohol. Treatment for hepatitis-related cirrhosis involves medications used to treat the different types of hepatitis, such as interferon for viral hepatitis and corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis. Cirrhosis caused by Wilson's disease, in which copper builds up in organs, is treated with chelation therapy (for example, penicillamine) to remove the copper.
Preventing further liver damage.
Regardless of underlying cause of cirrhosis, alcohol and paracetamol, as well as other potentially damaging substances, are discouraged. Vaccination of susceptible patients should be considered for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.
Transplantation.
If complications cannot be controlled or when the liver ceases functioning, liver transplantation is necessary. Survival from liver transplantation has been improving over the 1990s, and the five-year survival rate is now around 80%. The survival rate depends largely on the severity of disease and other medical problems in the recipient. In the United States, the MELD score is used to prioritize patients for transplantation. Transplantation necessitates the use of immune suppressants (cyclosporine or tacrolimus).
Decompensated cirrhosis.
In patients with previously stable cirrhosis, decompensation may occur due to various causes, such as constipation, infection (of any source), increased alcohol intake, medication, bleeding from esophageal varices or dehydration. It may take the form of any of the complications of cirrhosis listed below.
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis generally require admission to hospital, with close monitoring of the fluid balance, mental status, and emphasis on adequate nutrition and medical treatment - often with diuretics, antibiotics, laxatives and/or enemas, thiamine and occasionally steroids, acetylcysteine and pentoxifylline. Administration of saline is avoided as it would add to the already high total body sodium content that typically occurs in cirrhosis.
Complications.
Ascites.
Salt restriction is often necessary, as cirrhosis leads to accumulation of salt (sodium retention). Diuretics may be necessary to suppress ascites. Diuretic options for inpatient treatment include aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone) and loop diuretics. Aldosterone antagonists are preferred for patients who can take oral medications and are not in need of an urgent volume reduction. Loop diuretics can be added as additional therapy.
If a rapid reduction of volume is required, paracentesis is the preferred option. This procedure requires the insertion of a plastic tube into the peritoneal cavity. Human albumin solution is usually given to prevent complications from the rapid reduction. In addition to being more rapid than diuretics, 4–5 liters of paracentesis is more successful in comparison to diuretic therapy.
Esophageal variceal bleeding.
For portal hypertension, propranolol is a commonly used agent to lower blood pressure over the portal system. In severe complications from portal hypertension, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting is occasionally indicated to relieve pressure on the portal vein. As this shunting can worsen encephalopathy, it is reserved for those patients at low risk of encephalopathy. TIPS is generally regarded only as a bridge to liver transplantation or as a palliative measure.
Hepatic encephalopathy.
High-protein food increases the nitrogen balance, and would theoretically increase encephalopathy; in the past, this was therefore eliminated as much as possible from the diet. Recent studies show that this assumption was incorrect, and high-protein foods are even "encouraged" to maintain adequate nutrition.
Hepatorenal syndrome.
The hepatorenal syndrome is defined as a urine sodium less than 10 mmol/L and a serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl (or 24 hour creatinine clearance less than 40 ml/min) after a trial of volume expansion without diuretics.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Cirrhotic patients with ascites are at risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Which refers to changes in the mucosa of the stomach in patients with portal hypertension, and is associated with cirrhosis severity.
Infection.
Cirrhosis can cause immune system dysfunction, leading to infection. Signs and symptoms of infection may be aspecific and are more difficult to recognize (for example, worsening encephalopathy but no fever).
Hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary liver cancer that is more common in people with cirrhosis. People with known cirrhosis are often screened intermittently for early signs of this tumor, and screening has been shown to improve outcomes.
Epidemiology.
[[File:Cirrhosis of the liver world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|Disability-adjusted life year for cirrhosis of the liver per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.
Cirrhosis and chronic liver disease were the tenth leading cause of death for men and the twelfth for women in the United States in 2001, killing about 27,000 people each year. Also, the cost of cirrhosis in terms of human suffering, hospital costs, and lost productivity is high.
Established cirrhosis has a 10-year mortality of 34–66%, largely dependent on the cause of the cirrhosis; alcoholic cirrhosis has a worse prognosis than primary biliary cirrhosis and cirrhosis due to hepatitis. The risk of death due to all causes is increased twelvefold; if one excludes the direct consequences of the liver disease, there is still a fivefold increased risk of death in all disease categories.
Little is known on modulators of cirrhosis risk, apart from other diseases that cause liver injury (such as the combination of alcoholic liver disease and chronic viral hepatitis, which may act synergistically in leading to cirrhosis). Studies have recently suggested that coffee consumption may protect against cirrhosis, especially alcoholic cirrhosis.
Etymology.
The word "cirrhosis" derives from Greek κιρρός ["kirrhós"] meaning "yellowish, tawny" (the orange-yellow colour of the diseased liver) + the common Greek suffix of the third declension "-sis" known from other Greek-originated terms (such as ly-sis, amyloido-sis, necro-sis etc.) that in Greek means "condition" (thus cirrho+sis = a yellowish condition or a condition that makes one yellowish). While the clinical entity was known before, it was René Laennec who gave it the name "cirrhosis" (in the same 1819 work in which he also described the stethoscope).

Armand Gatti

Armand Gatti (born on January 26, 1924) is a French playwright, poet, journalist, screenwriter, filmmaker and former WW II resistance fighter. His debut film "Enclosure" was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival where he won the Silver Prize for Best Director. Two years later, his film "El Otro Cristóbal" was entered into the 1963 Cannes Film Festival.
Biography.
One of the most acclaimed theater writer/directors of the 20th century, Gatti was originally a member of the informal Left Bank group of filmmakers that included Alain Resnais, Chris Marker, Agnès Varda, Henri Colpi and Jean Cayrol, but because none of his films have been released on video in the US, he remains an elusive figure for many cinephiles. He appears in Resnais’ "Toute la mémoire du monde" (1956) and in Marker’s "Immemory" CD-Rom; he wrote "China" (1956) for Marker’s "Petite Planète" collection and traveled with Marker in the making of "Letter from Siberia" (1957), which inspired his book "Siberia — Zero + Infinity" the following year.
According to his 1989 biographer, Dorothy Knowles, Gatti was born in 1924 in a shantytown in Monaco (his Italian anarchist father, who escaped murder in a Chicago slaughterhouse because of his political activities, fled Benito Mussolini’s regime); during World War II, Gatti joined a small French resistance maquis. Captured, tortured, and sentenced to a concentration camp in Hamburg where he was forced to work in a diving bell at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, Gatti eventually escaped and joined a British Special Air Service special forces team. After the war, he worked as an award-winning journalist for many years until he traveled with Marker, published his first plays, and directed his first film, "Enclosure" (L’Enclos, 1961).
L’Enclos was screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival but it was hailed by Truffaut, Resnais, Cocteau and others.

Max Thomas Charles Waller (born 3 March 1988) is an English cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and a leg break bowler. He plays first-class cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club, and after impressing in the Second XI he was awarded a first team contract.
Career.
Waller made his debut for the first team in a Friends Provident Trophy match against Kent early in the 2009 season, finishing the game with modest figures of 1/46. His real breakthrough came in the Twenty20 Cup, where he impressed, playing all but two of the group stage games, and taking 10 wickets at 20.80. At the end of the 2009 season, he was named as part of the ECB Performance Programme 'C' squad to travel to South Africa.
Waller did not appear for Somerset in first-class cricket in the 2010 season, after the county signed Murali Kartik, and favoured Michael Munday early in the year. Waller did play occasional games in both the Clydesdale Bank 40 and Friends Provident t20 competitions. In nine Clydesdale Bank 40 matches during the season, Waller claimed four wickets at an bowling average of 61.50, while he did not claim any wickets in the Twenty20, bowling just three overs across his two appearances. He also made two appearances for Dorset during the year, and claimed four wickets in the Minor Counties Championship Final against Lincolnshire, helping Dorset to a 135 run victory.

Shivaharkaray

Shivaharkaray or Karavipur is a Shakti Peeth dedicated to the Hindu Goddess Durga, located near Parkai railway station, near Karachi, Pakistan. Puranas describe that the three eyes (the third eye) of the Goddess fell here after she committed Sati. The Goddess is worshipped as Mahishasuramardini, or the slayer of the Demon Mahishasur. Her consort, the Hindu God Shiva, is worshipped in Ragi form as Krodhish, personification of anger. Shivaharkaray is third in the list of 51 Peethas identified in the Puranas.
Legend.
Sati was the first wife of Shiva and first incarnation of Parvati. She was the daughter of King Daksha and Queen (the daughter of Brahma). She was insulted and hurt by her father not inviting both her and her husband to a yagna, and so she committed self-immolation at its sacrificial fire in grief. Shiva was distraught after hearing of her death, and danced around the world in a Tandav Nritya (“devastating penance” or dance of destruction), carrying her body on his shoulders. In order to return Shiva to normalcy, Vishnu used his Sudarshan Chakra, the rotating blade on his finger tip. He dismembered the body of Sati into several pieces, and wherever a piece fell on the earth, its location was consecrated as a divine shrine, or Shakthi Peeth, with deities of Sati (Parvati) and Shiva. 
These locations have become famous pilgrimage places as Pithas or Shakthi Pithas, and are scattered throughout the subcontinent, including in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, and India. Sati is also known as Devi or Shakthi. With the blessing of Vishnu she was reborn as the daughter of Himavat or Himalayas, and hence named Parvati, or daughter of mountains. She was born on the 14th day of the bright half of the month of Mrigashīrsha, which marks the Shivarathri, the night festival of Shiva.

Lakes Water Bird

The Lakes Water Bird, sometimes known as the "Avro Curtiss type" is remembered as the first consistently successful British seaplane, developed by the Windemere based Lakes Flying Co, during 1911.
Background.
Large bodies of water appealed to several aviation pioneers in the first two decades of the 20th century since they offered large spaces for take-off and emergency landings. Builders also anticipated naval interest. It emerged that one of the main problems was getting the floats to leave the water, that is to "unstick". The first seaplane to fly, on 28 March 1910 at Martigues, France was built by Henri Fabre, though the machine built by Glenn Curtiss and first flown on 26 January 1911 was the first practical seaplane. In England A.V.Roe & Co had put the first Type D on floats and it left the water on 18 November 1911 at Barrow-in-Furness using stepped floats, but dropped back into the water and was damaged. It flew successfully in April 1912, though always underpowered.
Development.
The Lakes Water Bird was built for 1911 E.W. Wakefield, of the Lakes Flying School, Windermere by A.V. Roe, who would build aircraft to the designs of individual customers. It was built as a landplane with the intention of converting it to a seaplane once testing was complete. Wakefield had been interested in water-borne aircraft since 1909 and had performed experiments with different float designs towed at speed across Lake Windermere. Unsticking problems persisted until he visited Henri Fabre in France and got useful advice on float design. The 12 ft (3.66 m) long float for the Water Bird followed Glen Curtiss' three-step float and was built by boat builders Borwick of Bowness-on-Windermere using mahogany reinforced with metal strips and canvas covered by local.
Avro built the aircraft in Manchester, transporting it to Brooklands for its first flight on 19 May 1911. It was a two-bay seat pusher biplane with wings of unequal span. The outer half of each upper wing carried a pair of ailerons; the larger inner one had a semicircular trailing edge extending well behind the wing trailing edge. Bamboo outriggers fore and aft of the wings supported leading elevators and tail surfaces plus rudder. Both elevator and rudder were operated by bamboo pushrods. Power was provided by a 50 hp (37 kW) Gnome Omega 7-cylinder rotary engine driving an 8 ft 6in (2.59 m) propeller.
After testing as a landplane at Brooklands in May 1911, the Water Bird was brought to the Hill of Oaks on Windermere and the float fitted in place of the wheeled undercarriage. A pair of cylindrical floats was mounted below the wing-tips for lateral stability on the water. The successful first flight was on 25 November 1911, with ex-Avro school pilot H. Stanley Adams.
Operational history.
Water Bird flew intensively during December 1911 and January 1912, logging some 60 flights. The longest was for 20 miles, reaching 800 ft. Joyriding passengers were carried through the Winter, but in March 1912 Water Bird was destroyed in its lakeside hangar by a storm. Remnants of the aircraft (float, rudder and tailplane) survived until at least 1961.
Water Bird was succeeded by the Lakes-built Water Hen, their first complete product. It was initially almost identical to its predecessor apart from straight edged ailerons. Larger, later modifications removed much of the similarity between the two aircraft, the later Water Hen having a much wider central float.

Émile Isola

Émile Isola was born on 4 September 1860 in Blida, Algeria and died in Paris on 17 May 1945. Along with his younger brother Vincent Isola with whose life and career he was closely involved, he was a conjurer and theatre director in Paris; they were known as the Frères Isola – the Isola Brothers.
Biography.
Born in Algeria of Italian parents, Émile Isola arrived in Paris in 1880, and with his brother undertook a variety of jobs before they first showed their conjuring act in public. They acquired the Théâtre des Capucines in 1892 and renamed it Théâtre Isola attracting large audiences.
At the end of 1895, the Isola brothers discovered the invention of the Frères Lumière, cinematography, and devised a projector called "Isolatographe" for which the films were provided by another pair of brothers, Frères Emile and Charles Pathé. By colouration of the films they were able to show ‘colour films’ at the Théâtre Isola.
In 1897, they bought the Parisiana and stopped their own act to become theatrical producers. The brothers became the directors of the Olympia in 1898, the Folies Bergère in 1901, and the Gaîté-Lyrique from 1903-1913. As joint directors of the Opéra-Comique from 1914-1925 (with Pierre-Barthélemy Gheusi and subsequently with Albert Carré), they revived "Penelope" by Fauré and "Le Festin de l'araignée" by Roussel, and produced Milhaud's first opera "La brebis égarée".
Their tenure at the Théâtre Mogador saw the Paris premieres of "No, No, Nanette" and "Rose Marie", and revivals of Offenbach operettas.
Directorship of the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt from 1926 brought about their ruin despite the success of the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev, and of Sacha Guitry and Yvonne Printemps. In 1936 the brothers were obliged to restart touring with their conjuring act. During the occupation of Paris in 1943, they took over the direction of the Théâtre Pigalle. They died in relative obscurity after the war.
In 1917 the Bouffes-Parisiens presented "L'Illusioniste", a play about the sentimental adventures of a magician, by Guitry inspired by the Isola brothers. 
He received the Légion d'honneur in 1922. He was married twice, to Sidonie Victorine Marie Courbarien and after her death, to Yvonne Cadet.

William Celling

William Celling (or William Tilly of Selling) (died 1494) was an English Benedictine prior (or abbot), diplomat, and humanist scholar.
Life.
He derived his name, according to John Leland, from the village of Celling, or Selling, some two miles from Faversham in Kent: Edward Hasted assigns him to a family settled at Selling near Hythe. He appears to have been a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury; thence he proceeded to the University of Oxford, where he became a member of the newly founded All Souls College.
He was elected prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, on 10 September 1472. It was in presumably subsequently that he made his first journey to Italy: Leland states that Celling became acquainted with Politian (born in 1454). While abroad Celling collected Latin and Greek manuscripts, and when he returned to England brought these with him. Among other works were a copy of Cicero's "Republic", of St. Cyril's and St. Basil's "Commentaries on the Prophets", and the works of Synesius are specially mentioned. For his manuscripts he restored the library over the prior's chapel, but many of his books were destroyed some quarter of a century later in a fire.
Celling was a careful manager, clearing the priory of debt and undertaking building work. He charged himself with the education of Thomas Linacre, who is said to have been his pupil at Canterbury, and who certainly accompanied him on his second journey to Italy, an embassy to Rome between 1485 and 1490. In 1490 and 1491 Celling was occupied with Richard Foxe, at that time the bishop of Exeter, in the negotiations between England, France, and Brittany. Some three years later he died on 10 December 1494. He was buried in the martyrium of Thomas Becket, in a richly blazoned tomb, on which was inscribed a long epitaph narrating his embassies to France and Rome.

Postchristianity

Postchristianity is the belief that the loss of the Christian monopoly in political affairs, especially in the Global North where Christianity had previously flourished, will eventually lead its demise in favour of secular nationalism. It includes personal world views, ideologies, religious movements or societies that are no longer rooted in the language and assumptions of Christianity, at least explicitly, although they had previously been in an environment of ubiquitous Christianity, i.e. Christendom.
Other scholars have disputed the global decline of Christianity, and instead hypothesized of an evolution of Christianity which allows it to not only survive, but actively expand its influence in contemporary societies.
The decline of Christianity.
Until recently, the overwhelming majority of Christians have lived in White nations, allowing theorists to speak of an "European Christian" civilization; conversely, radical writers have seen Christianity as an ideological arm of Western imperialism. As a result, the loss of Christian influence in the West has led to beliefs of inevitable global decline of Christianity.
Thus defined, a post-Christian world is one in which Christianity is no longer the dominant civil religion, but that has gradually assumed values, culture, and worldviews that are not necessarily Christian (and further may not necessarily reflect any world religion's standpoint, or may represent a combination of either several religions or none). Generally, therefore, post-Christian tends to refer to the loss of Christianity's monopoly, if not its followers, in historically Christian societies. For instance, according to the 2005 Eurobarameter survey, the majority of Europeans (in general) hold some form of belief in a higher power, although relatively fewer point explicitly to the Christian God.
In his 1961 "The Death of God", the French theologian Gabriel Vahanian argued that modern secular culture in most of Western Civilization had lost all sense of the sacred, lacked any sacramental meaning, and disdained any transcendental purpose or sense of providence, bringing him to the conclusion that for the modern mind, "God is dead".
Thomas J. J. Altizer and William Hamilton of Emory University, drew upon a variety of sources, including the aphorisms of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's "Letters and Papers from Prison", and brought this line of thought to public attention in a short-lived intellectual movement of the mid-to-late-1960s among Protestant theologians and ministerial students. Conservative reaction on the right and social-advocacy efforts on the left blunted its impact, however, and it was quickly overlooked in favor of more ethically-oriented movements such as the Social Gospel and feminist theologies, within mainline Protestantism.
Alternative perspectives.
Other scholars have disputed the global decline of Christianity, and instead hypothesized of an evolution of Christianity which allows it to not only survive, but actively expand its influence in contemporary societies.
Philip Jenkins hypothesized a "Christian Revolution" in the Southern nations, such as Africa, Asia and Latin America, where instead of facing decline, Christianity is actively expanding. The relevance of Christian teachings in the global South will allow the Christian population in these areas to continually increase, and together with the shrinking of the Western Christian population, will form a "new Christendom" in which the majority of the world's Christian population can be found in the South.
Charles Taylor, meanwhile, disputes the "God is Dead" thesis by arguing that the practices and understandings of faith changed long before the late 20th century, along with secularism itself. In "A Secular Age" Taylor argues that being "free from Christendom" has allowed Christianity to endure and express itself in various ways, particularly in Western society; he notes that otherwise secular ideas were, and continue to be, formed in light of some manner of faith. He stresses that "loss of faith" reflects simplistic notions on the nature of secularization, namely the idea of "subtraction." Thus "post-Christian" is, after a fashion, a product of Christianity itself.
Other uses.
Some American Christians (primarily Protestants) also use this term in reference to the evangelism of unchurched individuals who may have grown up in a non-Christian culture where traditional Biblical references may be unfamiliar concepts. This perspective argues that, among previous generations in the United States, such concepts and other artifacts of Christianese would have been common cultural knowledge and that it would not have been necessary to teach this language to adult converts to Christianity. In this sense, post-Christian is not used pejoratively, but is intended to describe the special remediative care that would be needed to introduce new Christians to the nuances of Christian life and practice.
Some groups use the term "post-Christian" as a self-description. Dana McLean Greeley, the first president of the Unitarian Universalist Association, described Unitarian Universalism as postchristian, insofar as Christians no longer considered it Christian, while persons of other religions would likely describe it as Christian, at least historically.

Yeay Mao

Yeay Mao or Lok Yeay Mao (in Khmer យាយម៉ៅ - លោកយាយម៉ៅ, Grandma Mao) is an ancient mythical heroine and a divinity in the local popular form of Buddhism and Brahmanism in Cambodia. She is venerated mainly is in the coastal provinces of the country, especially along the road from Phnom Penh to the sea port of Sihanoukville, as well as in Kampot and Kep. At the Bokor Mountain in Kampot there is a 29 meters tall monument to Yeay Mao inaugurated in 2012, while there is a young version of Yeay Mao in the Kep Beach called "Beautiful Lady" (ស្រីស្អាត) or "Sela waits for her husband" (សិលាចាំប្តី), but that belongs to the legend of Mao looking to the west for her lost husband. She is considered the protector of travelers and hunters. Drivers still stop at her shrine along National Road 4 near Phnom Pech Nil to pay their respects and wash their cars with water from the stream nearby, as well as the monument at Bokor.
History.
The history of Yeay Mao is unclear, being composed of several legends and interpretations. There are many popular stories surrounding her. It is said that she was a beautiful lady married to a powerful warrior. When he died, she took control of the armies against the Thai and became a celebrity. The story is placed sometime before the French Colony (1863–1953).
Another version says that Yeay Mao was the wife of Ta Krohom-Koh (តាក្រហមក) - literally ""Grandpa Red Neck"". They lived in the forest near Pech Nil Mountain (ភ្នំពេជ្រនិល). Once they went around and they met a tiger. Ta Krohom-Koh abandoned his wife and the tiger devoured her.
Since then, any traveller who passed by the place of the accident, paid respect to her spirit to avoid a similar fate.
When they built the highway between Phnom Penh and the sea in what is today Sihanoukville, a small temple was built at the spot. The road was finished by the French in 1876, a fact that increased the pilgrimage to the temple. It included Vietnamese and Chinese believers.
Celebration.
The main feast is celebrated in June. The believers go to the Temple or any place destined for the veneration, to bring sacred food, especially pig head, chicken soup, the "sla-toa" (ស្លាធម៌) - a coconut adorned with flowers and leaps and used in religious celebrations in Cambodia, the "bay-sei" (បាយសី)- section of banana tree trunk with legs to which three to nine layers of banana leaves rolled up in finger shape have been attached. It is used also in certain ceremonies.
The place of the veneration must be set with three statues:
Beliefs.
According to Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo, the story of Yeay Mao dates from 1866, when she was a spirit of cruelty that attacked any traveller that did not pay respects to her at Pech Nil Mountain (ភ្នំពេជ្រនិល).
If the person to whom the spirit sent strong pains because ignoring to pay veneration to her, repented, that person was healed. But if that person did not repent, he or she could die.
It was also believed that if a person presented his offering asking to hurt an enemy, the spirit used to fulfil the wish.
In 1900, the French army destroyed the first temple and the divinity came in decadence.
During the short Japanese invasion of Cambodia in 1940, the army of that country gathered the farmers of Kampot Province and Vietnamese, Chinese and Cham Cambodians, to dig trenches at the ancient sacred place. According to the legend, the workers desecrated the site, bringing the fury of the spirit. People started to suffer epidemics and many died. They explained these epidemics as the fury of Yeay Mao.
In order to placate the spirit, the people started again to offer gifts to Yeay Mao and the veneration revived. After the villages near to Pech Nil Mountain, pray to the divinity asking for health and protection. If there was, for example, a theft, they pray to the spirit to punish the criminal.

Biography.
John Krogstie received a MSc in 1991 and a PhD in 1995 both in information systems from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
From 1991 to 2000 he was employed as a manager in Accenture. In 2000-2005 he was a senior researcher in SINTEF. He is a professor in information systems at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway. 
John Krogstie is the Norwegian representative for IFIP TC8 and Chair (2010–2012) of IFIP WG 8.1 on information systems design and evaluation, where he is the initiator and leader of the task group for Mobile Information Systems.
Work.
Krogstie's research interests include information systems, conceptual modeling, mobile information systems, eGovernment and enterprise modelling.
The SEQUAL framework.
The SEQUAL framework is a reference model for evaluating the quality of models, the semiotic quality framework (SEQUAL) developed by John Krogstie. The SEQUAL framework is grounded in semiotics, particularly the semiotic theory of Charles W. Morris. It builds on semiotic theory and defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, a body of knowledge, a domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling.
Its usefulness was confirmed in an 2002 experiment. 
The basic idea behind the SEQUAL framework is, that conceptual models can be considered as sets of
statements in a language, and therefore can be evaluated in semiotic/linguistic terms. A first semiotic framework for evaluating conceptual models was originally proposed by Lindland et al. in the 1994 article "Understanding quality in conceptual modeling". In its initial version, it considered three quality levels: 
The framework was later extended, and called the SEQUAL framework by Krogstie et al. in the 1995 article "Defining quality aspects for conceptual models". In the 2002 article "Quality of interactive models" Krogstie & Jørgensen extended the initial framework adding
more levels of Stamper’s semiotic ladder.
Publications.
Krogstie has published around 150 refereed papers in journals, books, and archival proceedings since 1991. Books, a selection:

Khagol Vishwa

Khagol Vishwa (KV) is an organization for amateur astronomers working in Pune and Pimpri - Chinchwad Area, India. It was established on 17th Nov. 1999, under Society Registration Act, 1960. Science popularization, observation and analysis of astronomical events, public star gazing programs are some of the main activities of this organization.
History.
In 1998, the Leonid meteor shower was expected with outburst. Some enthusiastic students from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad area came together to observe that event scientifically. After observing that glorious event, all of them got inspired to do something different in Amateur Astronomy. They decided to form an official group under which they could come together; discuss on various topics in Astronomy, observe various events in the Sky and contribute to present amateur astronomical world. A group of 4 - 6 amateur astronomers in 1999 is now a well-known science exploring organization ‘Khagol Vishwa’. Khagol Vishwa is now working for a national Goal ‘Vision 2020’.
Structure.
There are four main sections
Observation section.
Planetary.
Planetary observations are helpful to study changes in the surfaces and study of satellites of planets like Jupiter, Saturn and Saturn Rings, Lunar surface and as well as transits and oppositions of Planets. These observations are visual and photographic.
Variable stars.
Visual observations of variable stars and plotting the light curves. These observations are reporting to the organizations- AAVSO. Khagol Vishwa has formed a special Variable Star Section (VSS) for detailed study in this field.
Occultations.
All types of eclipses, occultation of stars by planets and asteroids, lunar occultation, transits, timing these events, Photography and CCD observations for study of particular Astronomical body. 
Deep sky.
This section works for study of faint objects in the night sky. Observations of NGC and Messier objects, comet hunting, photography of deep sky through telescopes. 
Science popularization section.
This section works to popularize basic sciences and astronomy in society. Some of the activities under this section are
Khagol Prasar Abhiyaan.
Translated as "Astronomy Popularization Movement", under this, khagol vishwa conducts lectures on astronomy in schools, colleges as well as open public lectures. There are also Star Gazing Programs once or twice a month.
Pimpri-Chinchwad science congress.
A district level science congress is organised every alternate year. The aim of this event is to spread the awareness about fundamental sciences in high school students and to discuss local problems and issues and to encourage students to develop the science and technology to solve them.
Research and development section.
The aim of formation of this section is to create atmosphere of research and development (R&D) in India on amateur level. It will be helpful to encourage more and more students to do something, to find something for our society and Nation even if he/she is not with science background and working in different types of fields.
Some main projects under progress are ham radio networking for tele-education and communication under emergency, Mini weather stations in all main villages for knowing local environment, helpful for students and farmers, Creating electricity from bio gas, amateur mobile observatory for deep sky study and study of Near Earth Objects (NEO), Analyzing observations taken by all observers, publishing papers, making research projects.
Instrumentation section.
No research can be done without proper instruments. Khagol Vishwa tries to buy advance instruments necessary for its activities and to make them available to students and members. Some of these instruments are made by members themselves under Research and Development section.
Lonar conservation project.
Khagol Vishwa is one of the few organisations all over India who are working to create social awareness about the Lonar lake and also campaign against its environmental degradation 
. The organization has been studying the site for past 8 years and published the first report 2 years ago. The different aspects of Lonar crater has been studied by their members like, geology] and structure, ecology - flaura, fauna, agriculture, zoology, sociological, water level problem, pollution of Lonar Lake.

LiveLeak

LiveLeak is a UK-based video sharing website that lets users post and share videos. LiveLeak places emphasis on current events, politics and reality-based footage such as war scenes from various parts of the world.
History.
The site went live on October 31, 2006. Founded by the team responsible for the Ogrish.com shock site, it aims to take reality footage, politics, and world events and combine them with the power of citizen journalism.
Saddam Hussein execution.
The site came to prominence in 2007 following the unauthorized filming and leaking of the execution of Saddam Hussein, and was referred to by White House Press Secretary Tony Snow and then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
"Fitna".
LiveLeak was again in the spotlight in March 2008, when it hosted the anti-Qur'an film "Fitna" made by Dutch politician Geert Wilders. LiveLeak holds to being strictly non-biased in its approach to members and their content, believing in freedom of speech within the site rules regardless of how certain content might offend them personally. "Fitna" was taken down after threats were made against LiveLeak staff, but (as of 2008) is back online after LiveLeak reportedly improved security. The video was once again removed on April 1, this time it was removed by the user citing that it was taken down due to copyright wrangles and a new version will be uploaded "soon".
U.S. soldiers.
Since May 14, 2007, The United States Department of Defense has restricted access to websites such as YouTube and MySpace in order to prevent violations of Operations Security. One can easily watch war footage from Iraq and Afghanistan, which many show videos from soldiers of the United States and other countries.
Children fights.
On July 30, 2007, the BBC programme "Panorama" broadcast a show about how young people were getting physically assaulted and knocked unconscious. When "Panorama" queried the "extremely violent videos" that had been posted to LiveLeak's website, co-founder Hayden Hewitt refused to take them down, stating, "Look all this is happening, this is real life, this is going on, we're going to show it."
LiveLeak states there are relatively few such videos on the site and should the uploaders be found to have participated in the violent attack or filmed it themselves, it would aid the police with any prosecutions.
Content.
YourSay.
"YourSay" is a section of the website where users upload their own videos, much like a Vlog. Unlike YouTube, the Vlogs on LiveLeak are more political and are known for debate.
Currently LiveLeak has multiple categories including Syria and Ukraine, in which graphic content regarding various conflicts can be viewed.

February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall

The February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall was a prolonged period of snowfall that began on 1 February 2009. Some areas experienced their largest snowfall levels in 18 years. Snow fell over much of Western Europe. The United Kingdom's Met Office and Ireland's Met Éireann issued severe weather warnings in anticipation of the snowfall. More than of snow fell on parts of the North Downs and over in parts of the London area. Such snow accumulation is uncommon in London. On the morning of 6 February the majority of Great Britain and Ireland had snow cover, with the area surrounding the Bristol Channel (South Wales (Cardiff Area) and South West England (Bristol Area)) being most affected – had settled overnight around Okehampton, Devon, South West England with similar depths in South Wales. In Ireland the highest totals were recorded around East Kildare and Wicklow County's were up to 11 inches (28 cm) fell around Naas Co Kildare and even more along the Wicklow Mountains. The last time such widespread snowfall affected Britain was in February 1991. On the 2nd a total of had fallen in Leatherhead, Surrey just south of the M25. Also had fallen over the South Downs and in higher areas of Brighton.
On 2 February, all London buses were removed from service and there were severe delays on London Underground. All train services on Southeastern railway services between London, Kent and East Sussex were cancelled, as were those on Southern. South West Trains operated an emergency timetable with reduced service. Severe disruption occurred on First Capital Connect services, c2c services, First Great Western services, National Express East Anglia and Eurostar services from St Pancras International. Dublin Bus routes were also severely disrupted. All bus services in Brighton, Crawley and Royal Tunbridge Wells had been severely disrupted.
Heathrow Airport was closed and British Airways cancelled all departures for a period. London City, Luton, Aberdeen, Bristol, Cardiff, Birmingham and Southampton were also affected. The Gatwick Express railway service was suspended. In Ireland on 5 February Dublin Airport was closed for a period to allow snow to be cleared from the runways, delaying flights. Flights at the airport were cancelled the following day.
Other effects included lost work time and disruption to education. Costs, mainly in terms of lost work time, are estimated to amount to around £1.2 billion, although this may be underestimated. The adverse weather conditions caused schools in some areas of the United Kingdom to close during 2, 3 and 5 February in the Midlands.
A winter storm swept across the south of England on 9–10 February bringing heavy rain and snow, which caused flooding in southern England. In France, Paris's Charles de Gaulle International Airport was closed. In Aviemore, in the Scottish Highlands, a temperature of — according to the Met Office, was recorded; the lowest temperature recorded in the UK since 2003.
The maximum depth of the event was in Okehampton, Devon on 6 February. Other high amounts were Drybrook, Gloucestershire which had on 2 February reported in Leatherhead, in Purley, in Croydon, in Greater London, on the South Downs, in Brighton and on higher areas of Brighton.
The weather conditions severely disrupted the month's sporting schedule.
Synopsis.
The February 2009 snowstorm followed an intense Sudden stratospheric warming in the previous month. These events often help to set up surface weather patterns that give rise to cold spells and snowfall in Europe. The snow then resulted from several factors starting on 1 February, the main component of which was a strong low pressure area near Spain. A strong high pressure area over Scandinavia created a tight pressure gradient between the two systems. A cold front also was tracking over Britain at this time. After passing through the region, cold air set in behind it, enhanced by an upper-level low over Germany. An inverted trough then extended out from the cold front, bringing precipitation to England. Late on 2 February, a surface-low pressure system, the actual snow storm, developed over the English Channel.
Effects.
School closures.
The school closures in the United Kingdom prompted negative comments from parents who were unhappy about the "confusing and contradictory" messages they received.
Some have laid the blame of the excessive closures: "not" on the public's actual ability to make alternative travel arrangements - to 'cope', but on council and school administrators' having an unhelpful risk-averse 'health and safety driven' legal attitude.
Other concerns included parents having to take time off work when the weather was not quite as bad as it seemed.
Swansea University was closed on Tuesday 3 February through concern of the safety of students and staff using icy roads. The University of Exeter was closed from 15:00 on Friday 6 February because of icy conditions on its hilly campus, while the University of the West of England in Bristol and neighbouring institutions the University of Bath and Bath Spa University were closed on Thursday 5th and Friday 6th for similar reasons.[http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/2009/2/5/snow-thur0830.html [http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/2009/2/6/snow11.15.html].
Flooding.
On 9 February, heavy rain and melting snow caused flooding in southern England, exacerbated by high tides which trapped water in river systems. Heavy snow and floods closed roads in Cornwall, Devon, Oxfordshire, Somerset, Hampshire and Sussex. Areas of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire endured power cuts because of damage caused by the weight of snow on equipment or trees falling onto power lines. In Somerset, 20 people were rescued from their cars in Taunton and Yeovil because of floods, and rivers burst their banks.
Transport.
Transport links in many parts of the region were greatly affected by the bad weather. Railway services were reduced in frequency, with the south-east of England most affected, but were reintroduced over the following two days. South West Trains's services to and from Waterloo were disrupted, as were Southeastern and Southern trains services from Kent and the South Coast. By 3 February, only the District line saw route delays through London.
Many rural and urban bus services in Britain and Ireland were suspended. Transport for London reported that several bus routes had been "suspended or redirected" due to blocked roads. All buses were cancelled on 2 February after 20 buses slid off the road the previous day. London did not have enough snowploughs to cope with the widespread problems.
Dublin Bus experienced delays on 3 February, particularly in the southside of the city, around Lucan, Tallaght, Rathfarnham and Enniskerry. No buses were able to gain access to Lucan village or estates in Tallaght. Dublin's M50 experienced severe delays throughout with many commuters reporting lengthy periods until they reached their homes following work.
In other areas buses generally took amended routes, avoiding side roads or rural lanes and using only main roads.
Both Severn crossings were closed on 6 February because ice began falling from overhead gantries, affecting both the M4 and M48 motorways across the Severn Estuary; traffic was diverted into Gloucestershire and onto the M50. This was the first closure because of a weather related incident of the second Severn crossing since the structure opened in 1996. They reopened on 10 February.
The A23 between Brighton and Haywards Heath saw severe disruption on 2 February and the A27 through Brighton was closed because of the huge volume of snowfall.
Air traffic delays.
Heathrow Airport closed both of its runways; one was later reopened. British Airways cancelled all departures. London City, Luton and Southampton Airports were closed. The Gatwick Express railway service was suspended. Temporary closures also affected other international airports at Cardiff, Birmingham and Bristol.
On 5 February heavy snowfalls closed Dublin Airport in Ireland, leading to the cancellation of approximately half the flight operation or almost 200 flights. The airport closed at 01:00, blaming slippery runways, and flights were diverted to other airports. It reopened at 19:45 that evening but flights were disrupted by the weather again the following day.
Casualties.
The icy conditions led to many casualties on roads and exposed areas. Hospitals across the region reported great increases in injuries sustained from falling in the snow. Sites across south-central England, covering Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, reported that their emergency departments were very busy with minor injuries, with figures of more than one-quarter of all patients suffering falls.
News coverage.
News coverage of the snow received very high ratings, with over 7 million watching the BBC's 18:00 and 22:00 news programmes. The BBC News channel received its biggest audience since the 2007 London car bombs, and their website was sent 35,000 pictures and videos from people of the snow, their highest number ever.
Sporting changes and disruptions.
The region's sporting schedule for the early and latter parts of the week was severely affected by the extreme weather conditions. Sports such as hurling, camogie, gaelic football, association football, rugby union, rugby league, horse racing, motorsports and fox hunting were all disrupted in various ways summarised below.
Reaction.
In some regions of Britain, the response to the adverse weather conditions was considered an unnecessary panic – the Devon and Cornwall Business Council stated: ""We have had too many businesses closed unnecessarily because people were panicked by the weather forecast. (...) We have had too many schools closed down, which has an adverse impact on people who rely on carers to look after children. (...) I think we have over-reacted quite significantly."" It has been estimated that the weather cost the region's small businesses £40m.
Some media considered the panic amusing, comparing the UK to other countries. Hugo Rifkind wrote in his article: ""Other countries have trains. And snow. What happens there? I telephoned the Swedish answer to Network Rail. «I have read about your problems in the newspaper» says a spokesman from the press office, «and I had a little laugh»(...)"" He also notes that in 2008 in Aspen, Colorado, during one of the winter days there was of snow – buses stopped for half an hour, whereas in London, where there was less snow ( at its peak), buses were suspended for the whole day. Heather Mallick mentioned, that Toronto was about to set a snowfall record having of snow: ""We may be late for work. But we get there. It would be considered impossibly sappy not to."" She also stated: ""Britain, you don't have a snow emergency. You have a novelty.""
Aftermath.
In the wake of London's bus service closures, an inquiry was held into the inability of London's local authorities to work with public transport service providers.

Finnish Maiden

The Maiden of Finland (, ) is the national personification of Finland.
Personification.
She is a barefoot young woman in her mid-twenties with often braided blonde hair, blue eyes, wearing a blue and white national costume or a white dress. She was originally called Aura after the Aura River in Turku.
As a symbol, the Finnish Maiden has been used since the 19th century when she was pictured as a woman wearing a turreted crown, and then developing as Finland gained a national consciousness and independence.
Because of the historical bonds between Finland and Sweden, the Finnish Maiden has sometimes been interpreted as the daughter or younger sister of Mother Svea.
Mapping issues.
The Maiden of Finland can also refer to the shape of Finland on the map. With a little imagination it looks like a female form which has one hand raised (and another before the Moscow Armistice of 1944), a head, and a skirt. The metaphor is so commonly used that the northwestern area around Enontekiö is known as the Arm ("Käsivarsi") even in official contexts. Compare the dress in the painting above with the map on the right.

Bear at Home

The Bear at Home is a 16th-century public house in the South Oxfordshire (England) village of North Moreton, near Wallingford. It retains many original 16th-century features, including timber-framed walls, inglenook fireplace and a well, but was extended sympathetically in 1980 to allow it to serve food. New features include a minstrel's gallery above the bar, which is almost certainly unique. In 2007, the Freehouse was voted the best pub in Oxfordshire by CAMRA (Campaign for Real Ale) members, and its range of locally produced real ales, ensures it is a regular entry in the Good Beer Guide.
As recently as 1930, there were four pubs in this small village, serving a population of about 400 people but The Bear at Home is now the only remaining outlet. It overlooks the village green, home of Moreton Cricket Club (M.C.C), founded in 1858, a thriving club in this desirable commuter village, with members of all ages and ability; the pub has close ties with the cricket club, and is MCC's unofficial clubhouse.

Victor Reppert

Victor Reppert (born 1953) is an American philosopher best known for his development of the "argument from reason". He is the author of "C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea" (2003) and numerous academic papers in journals such as "Christian Scholars' Review", "International Journal for the Philosophy of Religion", "Philo", and "Philosophia Christi". He is also a philosophy blogger, with two blogs.
He holds a Ph.D. in philosophy (1989) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
The argument from reason.
Reppert first became interested in the argument from reason after a conversion experience at the age of 18. He became aware that while unbelievers like Bertrand Russell claimed to be more rational than believers, Christians like C. S. Lewis claimed not only that their belief is more rational than unbelief, but that the argument from reason shows that the very capacity to reason is itself a reason to think that the naturalism espoused by unbelievers is false. When he read G. E. M. Anscombe's critique of Lewis's argument, Reppert became persuaded that the argument could be formulated in such a way as to overcome Anscombe's objections. His paper "The Lewis-Anscombe Controversy: A Discussion of the Issues" was the result.
In 1998, Reppert posted his paper "The Argument from Reason" to the Secular Web. In 1999 a slightly revised version of the same paper appeared, with a response by Jim Lippard, in the humanist journal "Philo". In the same issue, Keith M. Parsons, the then editor of "Philo", presented some arguments against Reppert's conclusions in the course of a review of Thomas Nagel's "The Last Word", so in 2000 Reppert wrote a "Reply to Parsons and Lippard", to which Parsons responded by writing the first full-dress attempt to refute Reppert's argument. Reppert's reply to Parsons was the paper "Causal Closure, Mechanism, and Rational Inference", which, since he felt it was time that more Christian philosophers were familiarized with the argument and related issues, appeared in 2001 in "Philosophia Christi". In 2003 "Philosophia Christi" featured a "Symposium on the Argument from Reason", consisting of a paper by Reppert, responses by Theodore M. Drange, William Hasker and Keith Parsons, and a second paper by Reppert replying to these three critics.
Also in 2003, Reppert published his book "C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea". The title alludes to Daniel Dennett's "Darwin's Dangerous Idea", in which Dennett contrasted two types of explanation: one type is "mind-first" (that is to say, "in the last analysis ... purposeful and intentional"), whereas the other type "makes the explanation a feature of the system that in the last analysis is a product of the mindless system of physics and chemistry." For Dennett, Reppert observes, Darwin's dangerous idea is that the latter "are the only acceptable types of explanation", a position that "has become orthodoxy in such varied disciplines as evolutionary biology, cognitive science and artificial intelligence", as well as "in Anglo-American philosophy in general". C. S. Lewis's dangerous idea, by contrast, is that the attempt entirely to account for the world in such terms "overlooks something very important: the world thus analyzed has to have scientists in it. And scientists draw their conclusions from evidence, and in so doing they engage in rational inference... Lewis's contention was that ... if you tried to account for the activity of reasoning as a byproduct of a fundamentally nonpurposive system, you end up describing something that cannot genuinely be called reasoning." In "Darwin's Dangerous Idea", Dennett calls Darwin's idea "wonderful", "magnificent", and "the single best idea anyone has ever had", and says that his (Dennett's) admiration for it is "unbounded". Reppert observes that "If Darwin's dangerous idea is a true explanation of how Darwin got his dangerous idea, then the idea cannot possibly be the intellectual monument that Dennett supposes it to be."
"C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea" attracted a lot of response, including some comments by critics, most notably Richard C. Carrier, who on Internet Infidels called the book "surely the most extensive defense of the so-called 'Argument from Reason' yet to appear in print." Carrier's review "is about as long as the book itself", Reppert noted only half-jokingly, before going on to respond to some of Carrier's criticisms. Another response to Carrier's review came from Darek Barefoot, who, while he did not "find all of Reppert's arguments to be persuasive and all of Carrier's criticisms to be off-target", believed that the core of the argument from reason "is sound and that Reppert's book is a landmark contribution to the subject." Barefoot argued that Reppert had made a strong case for Lewis's claim "that the process of inference by which consideration of premises causes us to adopt a conclusion cannot be coherently conceived of in terms of physical cause-and-effect alone." Furthermore, if Reppert's version of the Argument from Reason "is successful, it reveals that rationality is fundamental to the universe, not simply a by-product of physical cause-and-effect; and this, in turn, is readily explicable on theism, but problematic for naturalism."
Jim Lippard, reporting a lecture by Daniel Dennett at Arizona State University in 2009, recounted that Dennett had coined the disparaging term "mind-creationists" for those who argue that original intentionality is an irreducible feature of the world. Lippard noted that the "mind-creationists" whom Dennett had in his sights included atheists like Thomas Nagel, John Searle and Jerry Fodor as well as believers like Victor Reppert.
The Anscombe myth.
In addition to explaining and expanding Lewis's theistic argument for God, Reppert has also made an important contribution to Lewis studies by deconstructing what he calls the "Anscombe myth". Roughly, the "Anscombe myth" arose, in part, from an actual encounter C. S. Lewis had at his Socratic Club with Catholic philosopher G. E. M. Anscombe, over the soundness of the theistic argument he presents in his book "Miracles". It has been alleged that Elizabeth Anscombe, in her presentation of the perceived problematic areas in Lewis's argument, had so thoroughly discredited his argument that Lewis sank into apologetic and theological obscurity. It has also been suggested that this friendly encounter led Lewis to not only reject the Argument from Reason, but also significantly question the validity of Christianity altogether. Reppert, in his critique of the "Anscombe myth", points out that Lewis merely revised his argument for later editions of "Miracles", rather than reject it. Furthermore, Reppert notes that Lewis continued to proactively maintain the argument, as evidenced by the publication of several post-Anscombe-debate articles; chiefly in "Christian Reflections" and "God in the Dock". Reppert also points out that Lewis's spiritual tenor in his later writings doesn't significantly differ in tone or substance from his earlier Christian material.

Samuel Parker (writer)

Samuel Parker (1681–1730) was an English writer.
Ancestors.
Parker was the younger son of the English theologian and clergyman Samuel Parker (1640–1688), who served as Bishop of Oxford and President of Magdalen College during the tumultuous reign of James II.
Life and work.
After early schooling in Kent, Parker attended Trinity College, Oxford, but left after several years, c. 1700, without taking a degree, evidently because he was unwilling to take the oath of allegiance.
Parker published two translations of Cicero ("Tully's Five Books De Finibus", 1702; "Cicero's Cato Major, etc", 1704) and a verse translation of Homer's battle of the frogs and the mice ("Homer in a Nutshel"l, 1699). He also translated the orations of Athanasias and produced an abridged translation of Eusebius, which was eventually bundled with other translations and abridgments of early church fathers.
He was responsible from 1708 to 1710 for a monthly periodical entitled "Censura temporum, or Good and Ill Tendencies of Books". This was a book review in dialogue form which upheld orthodoxy and the Church of England against the anti-trinitarian religious ideas of Whiston and the political notions of Locke.
Parker published two volumes of essays:"Six Philosophical Essays" (1700) and "Sylva" (1701). These include early critiques of the religious and political ideas of Locke. Among other things, Parker argues for the immateriality and hence immortality of the soul.
Parker's chef d'ouvre was "Bibliotheca Biblica" (collected in 5 vols., 1720–1735), a massive compilation of patristic commentary on the Bible, issued in monthly installments beginning in 1717 and funded via subscription. Parker hoped to cover all of the books of the Bible. However, at the time of his death only the first five volumes, covering the Pentateuch, had been completed. The fifth and final volume was published posthumously, in 1735, with a life of Parker appended.
Parker was a nonjuror, but he was persuaded by Dodwell's arguments in "The Case in View", and began attending the Church of England again after the death of Bishop Lloyd, circa 1710-11. However, he remained a Jacobite and continued to avoid taking the oaths. He signallized his objections to the reigning monarchs by making various gestures during the prayers for the royal family. He refused to take orders in the Church of England and raised his sons in accordance with his nonjuring principles.
Parker ran an academy in Holywell, Oxford, where the nonjuror Thomas Deacon was educated. He also provided room and board for visiting foreigners for many years. There are many references to him in Thomas Hearne's diaries.
Descendents.
Parker had at least five sons. His eldest son, Samuel, after serving an apprenticeship in London, became a yeoman bedel at Oxford. His second son, Sackville, was a well-known Oxford bookseller who kept a shop in the High Street at the corner of Logic Lane and was a friend of Samuel Johnson. His third son, Richard, attended Lincoln College, Oxford, on a scholarship, but left without a degree on account of the oaths and later helped his father prepare the "Bibliotheca Biblica". Other descendants founded the well-known Parker's bookselling establishment in the Turl, Oxford.

Showdown (Pendulum song)

"Showdown" is the fourth single and first track from the album "In Silico" by Australian drum and bass band Pendulum. It has been remixed by several artists, including DJ Clipz (who is also Red Light) and Excision. It is also the first single taken from "In Silico" not to use the album logo prominently on its cover.
The single was originally released through various online music stores on 5 January 2009. It was not available in any physical format until 9 February, when Warner Music UK released the 12" picture disc of "Showdown". To help promote the single, Pendulum also released a "Space Invaders" themed video game which offered players a chance of winning an official framed gold disc of "In Silico".
Background and writing.
"Showdown" was originally written and produced for the album "In Silico" by Rob Swire. Although primarily influenced by drum and bass, the song contains prominent elements of both early hard rock and techno, and has even been described as "dance metal" by some critics. "Showdown" opens with vocals from Swire, before going into a heavy guitar riff which is the main focus of the track. It also makes extensive use of both sampled and acoustic drums to produce large and heavy sounds respectively.
Critical reception.
"Showdown" has received generally positive reviews from music critics. Angry Ape reviewer David Adair described the single as "a snappy and slightly abrasive number that will keep their new found fans amongst the Kerrang reading community, very happy". David Knight observed that "you won't hear a better riff on a dance track without a great amount of searching", but described the remixes released with the single as "absolutely terrible". It was chosen as "Single of the Week" on 12 January 2009 by the British tabloid newspaper "Daily Star".
Music video.
The music video for "Showdown", directed by Nick Bartleet, was released on MySpaceTV on 12 December 2008 to promote Pendulum's upcoming single. It was originally intended to be Internet-only, but was subsequently A-listed on the television channel MTV Dance.
The video draws parallels from dog fighting, focusing on a fight scene in which the dogs are replaced by two young women, and culminates in the escape of one woman at the end of the video. It also depicts controversial scenes of women being kept in cages and men gambling on the outcome of fights, which contributed to Knight describing the video as "highly problematic". Some scenes of the video have been compared with the movie "Fight Club" by various sources, including Bartleet.
Promotional video game.
On 24 December, shortly after the release of their music video, Pendulum presented a "Space Invaders" themed video game on their website to further promote "Showdown". By scoring more points, players who submitted their details could unlock more of the "Live at the Brixton Academy" version of "Showdown". They also had a chance of winning an official framed gold disc of "In Silico".
The game was a modified version of "Space Invaders", in which the aliens had been replaced with different coloured variants of the "In Silico" logo, and the bunkers were replaced with pairs of letters spelling out the band's name. Players had three lives to score as many points as possible, after which their score was logged on a high score table. The album version of "Showdown" was played during the game.
Marketing and release.
"Showdown" was first released on 5 January 2009 through various online music stores, including 7digital, Amazon.com, and iTunes. Along with the album version and radio edit of the song, the download bundle included a live recording and several remixes by other artists. The single was later released on a 12" picture disc, containing the album version and Excision remix of "Showdown", on 9 February by Warner Music UK.
The song "Showdown" was featured on "In Silico" as the opening track. It was the first single from the album not to use the "In Silico" logo prominently on its cover, although most of the logo can be seen on a bass drum in the cover art. Live versions of the song have appeared on "iTunes Live: London Festival '08", as a B-side on "The Other Side", as well as in the single download bundle. It was also featured in the soundtrack of Disney Interactive Studios' off-road racing video game "Pure". The track is also featured in the first trailer for Forza Motorsport 3, on the Xbox 360 as well as in the game itself during races, and "" episode "Green Piece".

We Are Church

We Are Church is a movement that advocates changing the teachings and the structures of responsibility and authority of the Catholic Church. It originated in German-speaking Austria, Germany and South Tyrol in 1995 under the title "Wir sind Kirche" and was organized as an international association in 1996.
It has described Hans Küng as the spiritual father of initiatives that led to the founding of We Are Church.
Organization.
The association is composed of groups in various countries and does not accept individual members. A list of its national Media Contacts, with e-mail addresses and in some cases telephone numbers, is given on its website.
Objectives.
The movement adopted in 1997 a manifesto that made five demands:
Initiatives.
In 2006, the German association published 79 theses of different authors, which included "God is not almighty", "Jesus Christ should not be seen as 'Lord'", "Mary was not a virgin at the birth of Jesus", and "The 'holy catholic church' is neither holy nor catholic".
On 4 June 2008, in response to a decree of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that declared subject to an excommunication whose lifting was reserved to the Holy See anyone who attempted to confer holy orders on a woman, the international movement issued a statement under the heading, "Jesus Christ did not ordain men or women to the ministerial priesthood but to care for and nurture each other as brothers and sisters". In July of the same year, it congratulated the "Anglican Church" for its intention to consecrate women bishops and declared its regret at "the unchristian attitude of the Vatican establishment which, once again, usurping its mission, has come out in criticism of our Anglican brothers and sisters over the decision".
Excommunication of a foundress.
On 22 March 2014, the "Tiroler Tageszeitung" published an interview with Martha Heizer, chairperson and co-founder of the international movement, and her husband, in which they stated that they had been informed that, in line with canon 1378 §2, they were excommunicated on account of their priestless "private Eucharistic celebrations".

While these sites are widely spread across all five of Portland's quadrants, heavy concentrations are found in the Downtown and Southwest Hills neighborhoods of the Southwest quadrant, and the Northwest District neighborhood of the Northwest quadrant.
Only historic places within the municipal boundaries of Portland are shown in this list and its companion lists for the other four quadrants. Some sites beyond city limits will appear in other lists showing "Portland" as a general locality, but are excluded here. Although Portland's legal boundaries extend into Clackamas and Washington counties, all of the city's National Register sites lie within Multnomah County.

Cory Clouston

Cory Clouston (; born September 19, 1969 in Viking, Alberta) is an ice hockey coach, who currently serves as head coach of the Prince Albert Raiders of the Western Hockey League. He has previously served as head coach of the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Binghamton Senators of the American Hockey League (AHL), the Brandon Wheat Kings and the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League.
Playing career.
Born in Viking, Alberta, Clouston attended the University of Alberta from 1989–1993 where he earned a bachelor's degree in recreation administration. He played hockey for the University's Golden Bears team and was a member of the 1991–92 Canadian Interuniversity Sport championship squad.
Early coaching career.
Clouston's first coaching position was as an assistant coach with the Powell River Paper Kings of the British Columbia Junior Hockey League in 1994-95. He then served as general manager and head coach of the Grande Prairie Storm of the Alberta Junior Hockey League. During his tenure with the Storm, the team compiled a .627 winning percentage (143-82-15) and he was named AJHL coach of the year in 1995-96. He joined the staff of the Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1999 as an assistant coach. In the summer of 2002, he was elevated to the head coach position of the Ice, which he held for five years compiling a .655 winning percentage (209–110–20–21). The club's best season under his leadership was 2004–05 when the club made it to the Western Conference final. Clouston also served as a coach for Hockey Canada during his junior hockey coaching years, as assistant coach for the national under-18 2005 Junior World Cup gold medalists, and head coach for the 2006 team that also took home gold.
NHL coach.
He joined the professional team coaching ranks in 2007, when he joined the Binghamton Senators of the American Hockey League (AHL). Clouston was elevated to the head coaching position with the Ottawa Senators on February 2, 2009, following the firing of Craig Hartsburg. Though initially named interim head coach in Ottawa, Clouston's early success was rewarded and the club signed him to a two-year contract extension on April 8, 2009. He was the eighth person to hold the head coach position in modern Senators' history.
With Ottawa, Clouston had attempted to change the Senators' game plan to be more of an attacking one, creating turnovers and generating offense as opposed to the defence-first system which Hartsburg had attempted to utilize. Clouston coached the Senators to a somewhat successful 2009-10 season, finishing with 44 wins and 94 points and a berth in the Stanley Cup playoffs. The team ultimately lost in the first round to the Pittsburgh Penguins. A disappointing 2010-11 season saw Ottawa, beset by injuries to key players Daniel Alfredsson and Jason Spezza and erratic goaltending, languish in last place of the Eastern Conference standings for several weeks. General Manager Bryan Murray (ice hockey) made a flurry of midseason trades and promoted many minor leaguers for tryouts. The Senators played better as the season wound down, but finished out of the playoffs. Clouston was relieved of his duties by GM Bryan Murray on April 9, 2011.
On June 14, 2011, the Senators announced former Detroit Red Wings assistant coach Paul MacLean as Clouston's successor.
Return to the WHL.
On August 3, 2011, Clouston was named Head Coach of the Brandon Wheat Kings, replacing Kelly McCrimmon, who stepped aside to focus on his duties as GM.
On May 15, 2012, it was announced that Clouston would not return as head coach of the Wheat Kings.

WACS (cable system)

WACS (West Africa Cable System) is a submarine communications cable linking South Africa with the United Kingdom along the west coast of Africa that was constructed by Alcatel-Lucent. The cable consists of four fibre pairs and is 14,530 km in length, linking from Yzerfontein in the Western Cape of South Africa to London in the United Kingdom. It has 14 landing points, 12 along the western coast of Africa (including Cape Verde and Canary Islands) and 2 in Europe(Portugal and England) completed on land by a cable termination station in London. The total cost for the cable system is $650 million.
WACS was originally known as the Africa West Coast Cable (AWCC) and was planned to branch to South America but this was dropped and the system eventually became the West African Cable System.
Landing points.
The cable has landed in the following countries and locations:
The landings in Namibia, the DRC, the Republic of Congo and Togo will provide the first direct connections for these countries to the global submarine cable network. While all earlier submarine cables were terminated at South Africa's international submarine gateways in Melkbosstrand or Mtunzini the WACS cable has been landed at Yzerfontein in order to reduce risk of complete isolation from the rest of the world in the case of damages by earthquakes or a large ship dragging its anchor.
Design capacity.
The design capacity of WACS is at least 3.84 Tbit/s, now upgraded to 5.12 Tbit/s.
Innovations.
Instead of powering the 236 undersea optical amplifiers and the 12 Submarine branching units along the cable by a single conductor which would require the voltage to be well over 12,000 to 14,000 V in the order of some 24,000 V DC, the system is supplied by two independent rings from Europe to West Africa and West Africa to South Africa, thus reducing the power requirements to around 12,000 V DC.
Branching units are designed to keep the main trunk intact in case of failure. Repairing a branch will not affect the traffic on the main cable.
Landing stations support wavelength pass through which means a wavelength coming into a landing station does not just stop there but carries on. This feature allows future upgrade to be carried out without the necessity to have to upgrade each landing point.
Topology.
One of the four fibre pairs is a direct route from South Africa to Europe, a so-called "express lane". The second and third fibre pairs are designed as a "semi-express lane", one with two hops, from South Africa to West Africa and West Africa to Europe and the other with three stops. The fourth fibre pair is an "omnibus fibre" that stops off at all landing ports en route.
Construction and ownership.
The following South African companies were announced as participants in the construction and maintenance of the cable system. MTN Group has invested $90 million in the cable making it the largest investor, and in return will receive 11% of the initial capacity of the cable.
On 8 April 2009, the following companies signed the WACS Construction and Maintenance Agreement and formed the final consortium:The WACS consortium includes 12 companies. They are:
The supply contract has been signed the same day between the consortium members and Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Networks.
subsea's cable laying operations began 15 July 2010 by the departure of Île de Bréhat vessel from Alcatel-Lucent’s submarine cable's factory of Calais loaded with almost 6000 km of submarine cables.
The cable has been simultaneously laid by Alcatel-Lucent’s cable ships Île de Bréhat and her sister ship Île de Sein.
subsea's cable laying operations are officially finished 19 April 2011 by the landing of the cable on a Yzerfontein's beach in South Africa after less than ten months of sea operations.
The cable became operational on 11 May 2012 by the launching of the cable in South Africa
The 4-fibre pair submarine cable system was constructed at an approximate total project cost of US$650 million.

Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980

Ronald Reagan, the 33rd Governor of California, announced his candidacy for President of the United States in New York City on November 13, 1979. On July 17, 1980, he became the nominee of the Republican Party for the 1980 presidential election. After receiving the Republican nomination, he selected one of his opponents in the primary elections, George H. W. Bush, to be his running mate.
On November 4, 1980, Reagan carried 44 states and received 489 electoral votes to win the election. Jimmy Carter, the incumbent president, carried six states, as well as Washington, D.C., and received 49 electoral votes. Reagan won 50.7 percent of the popular vote, Carter took 41 percent, and Independent John B. Anderson (a liberal Republican) received 6.7 percent. Reagan's election as President was completed with the meeting of the Electoral College on December 15, 1980 and with the subsequent certification of the college's vote by the Joint session of the United States Congress on January 6, 1981.
Chronicle.
Primaries.
Reagan announced his candidacy for President of the United States in New York City on November 13, 1979.
End of the primaries.
On May 20, 1980, after the Michigan and Oregon primaries, Ronald Reagan secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination for the Republican Party. His opponent in the general election, incumbent President Jimmy Carter, passed the delegate threshold to become the presumptive nominee of his party on June 3. On May 26, George H. W. Bush, Reagan's remaining opponent for the Republican nomination, conceded defeat and urged his supporters to back Reagan.
Vice Presidential selection.
Ronald Reagan's choice for vice presidential running mate had been a subject of speculation since the end of the primaries. When former President Gerald Ford revealed in a CBS interview with Walter Cronkite that he was seriously considering the vice presidency, Ford garnered a great deal of interest. However, after Ford suggested the possibility of a "copresidency" and, in addition, insisted that Henry Kissinger be re-appointed as Secretary of State and that Alan Greenspan be appointed as Secretary of the Treasury, negotiations to form a Reagan-Ford ticket ceased. Less than twenty-four hours before Reagan formally accepted the Republican nomination, he telephoned George H. W. Bush to inform Bush of his intent to nominate him. The following day, July 17—the final day of the Republican National Convention—Reagan officially announced Bush as his running mate.
Republican National Convention.
The 1980 Republican National Convention convened at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. The convention was centered on the theme "Make America Great Again". Reagan accepted the Republican nomination on the final day of the convention:
"With a deep awareness of the responsibility conferred by your trust, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. I do so with deep gratitude, and I think also I might interject on behalf of all of us, our thanks to Detroit and the people of Michigan and to this city for the warm hospitality they have shown. And I thank you for your wholehearted response to my recommendation in regard to George Bush as a candidate for vice president."
Opinion polling.
Weeks before the election, Reagan trailed Carter in most polls. In the Gallup poll on October 26, Jimmy Carter was at 47 percent and Ronald Reagan at 39 percent. Following his sole debate with President Carter on October 29, Reagan overcame the largest deficit since Gallup polling began in 1936, and within one week, the Associated Press reported that the race was "too close to call." Three weeks before the election, Yankelovich, Skelly and White, produced a survey of 1,632 registered voters showing the race almost dead even, as did a private survey by Caddell. Two weeks later, a survey by CBS News and "The New York Times" showed a similar situation. Some pollsters at that time, however, were getting results that showed a slight Reagan lead; ABC News-Harris surveys consistently gave Reagan a lead of a few points until the climactic last week of October.
Political positions.
Through the 1970s, the United States underwent a wrenching period of low economic growth, high inflation and interest rates and intermittent energy crises. Reagan was an adherent of supply-side economics, which argues that economic growth can be most effectively created using incentives for people to produce (supply) goods and services, such as adjusting income tax and capital gains tax rates. Accordingly, Reagan promised an economic revival that would affect all sectors of the population. Reagan theorized that cutting tax rates would actually increase tax revenues because the lower rates would cause people to work harder as they would be able to keep more of their money.
Reagan called for a drastic cut in "big government" programs, and pledged to deliver a balanced budget for the first time since 1969. In the primaries, Bush famously called Reagan's economic policy "voodoo economics" because it promised to lower taxes and increase revenues at the same time.

Pointe-des-Cascades, Quebec

Pointe-des-Cascades is a village municipality in Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality in the Montérégie region of Quebec, Canada. It is located on a spit of land where the Saint Lawrence River flows into Lake Saint-Louis. The river has here a significant drop, forming several cascades which give the village its name.
History.
Starting in the mid seventeenth century until 1700, many military expeditions arrived at this place in order to portage around the cascades on the Saint Lawrence River. The first reference to Pointe-des-Cascades appeared in a text of Louis-Armand de Lahontan in 1684 and on a map of Deshayes in 1695, when Pointe des Cascades was included in the Vaudreuil Lordship.
In 1893, the post office opened under the English name Cascades Point (renamed in 1951 to Pointe-des-Cascades). A few years later construction began on the Soulanges Canal and when it was completed in 1899, the village became the eastern, downstream terminus of the canal. In 1958, it closed when it was superseded by the new Beauharnois Canal. The paths along the canal are now being used as a regional cycling route.
In 1961, the Village Municipality of Pointe-des-Cascades was formed on the territory of the Parish Municipalities of Saint-Joseph-de-Soulanges and Saint-Michel-de-Vaudreuil.

Gurre Castle

Gurre Castle () was a royal castle in North Zealand in Denmark which lies on the outskirts of Helsingør towards the town of Tikøb on the lake at Gurre (Gurre Sø). The castle, now a ruin, was built in the 12th century and added 4 towers and a perimeter wall in the 1350s; it was excavated in the 19th century (from 1835) and is now restored. It is first mentioned in court chronicles in 1364, when Pope Urban V sent a gift of relics to its chapel. The castle is associated with a legend about a Danish king named Waldemar (usually identified with the 14th-century Valdemar IV Atterdag), his love for his beautiful mistress Tove Lille (Little Tove) and the jealousy of Queen Helvig. Over the centuries, this core saga was enriched by other legends, eventually growing into a national myth of Denmark. Valdemar IV died in the castle in 1375. The myth was put into poetical form by the novelist and poet Jens Peter Jacobsen; a German translation of his poems forms the text of the huge cantata "Gurrelieder" by Arnold Schoenberg.

Frank Kirkleski

Frank William Kirkleski was a professional football player from Nutley, New Jersey. He played during the early years of the National Football League for the Pottsville Maroons, Orange Tornadoes, Newark Tornadoes and the Brooklyn Dodgers. Kirkleski played college football for Lafayette College, in which he graduated from in 1927.
College.
While at Lafayette, Kirkleski was known as a hard-hitting back. He played all four of his college years as a varsity halfback. During his freshman season, he shocked Lafayette's archrival, Lehigh University, with a touchdown run that gave the Leopards a 13-3 last-minute victory in 1923. Lehigh would only score three points in Kirkleski's four years at Lafayette. In his sophomore year, he helped guide Lafayette to a 7-2 record. He was named the team's captain during his senior year. It was then that he helped the Leopards capture their third National Championship with a 9-0 record. He received second and third team All American honors from the "New York Telegraph" and "The New York World" in 1926. He was later inducted into the school's Maroon Club Hall Of Fame in 2001.
Pottsville Maroons.
After college Kirkleski played for the Pottsville Maroons of the National Football League. In his professional debut, Kirkleski threw two touchdown passes to led the Maroons over the Buffalo Bisons 22-0. Then on October 16, 1927, he led his team down the field on three passes, where he recovered a fumble, by teammate Tony Latone, in the endzone to give the Maroons a last minute win over the Providence Steam Roller. Kirkleski would haunt Providence again in a rematch on November 24. In that game, he threw a 21 yard pass to Gus Kenneally to give Pottsville a 6-0 victory.
Orange Athletic Club.
In 1928, Kirkleski joined the independent Orange Athletic Club from New Jersey. During a game against the NFL's Staten Island Stapletons, he threw for a touchdown and combined, with another quarterback, to throw for 143 yards on 23 passes without an interception, which was an accomplishment in 1928. However Kirkleski gave up a costly interception, in the team's finale against the Stapletons, which was returned for a Staten Island touchdown. That error resulted in a 6-0 Orange loss.
Orange-Newark Tornadoes.
In 1929 he joined the Orange Tornadoes. That year Kirkleski had 1 rushing touchdown and 1 receiving touchdown. When the team was renamed the Newark Tornadoes in 1930, Kirkleski rushed for one touchdown.
Brooklyn Dodgers.
Kirkleski's final year in professional football, in 1931, was spent with the Brooklyn Dodgers. He only played three games that season and did not register a score for that season.

Lou Johnson (singer)

Lou Johnson (born 1941, Brooklyn, New York City) is an American soul singer and pianist who was active as a recording artist in the 1960s and early 1970s.
Life and career.
Coming from a musical family, he started singing in gospel choirs in his teens, before studying music at Brooklyn College. He learned keyboards and percussion, forming a gospel group, the Zionettes, who recorded for Simpson Records and achieved some local success. Johnson then formed a secular vocal group, the Coanjos, with Tresia Cleveland and Ann Gissendammer, recording "Dance The Boomerang" before Cleveland and Gissendammer left to become The Soul Sisters. 
In 1962, Johnson signed as a solo singer with Big Top Records, run by the Hill & Range music publishing company in the Brill Building. There, he met the songwriting team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David, who wrote Johnson's first single, "If I Never Get To Love You". Neither that song nor his second record, "You Better Let Him Go", were hits, but his third single, "Reach Out For Me", also written by Bacharach and David and this time produced by Bacharach, reached # 74 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in late 1963. However, as it rose up the charts, the record company collapsed so limiting the record's success. 
Johnson signed to its successor label, Big Hill and continued to record Bacharach and David songs. In 1964, his original version of "(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me", with backing vocals by Doris Troy, Dee Dee Warwick, and Cissy Houston, reached # 49 in the US charts. In the UK, a cover version by English singer Sandie Shaw rose to number one on the British singles chart. 
Johnson also recorded the original versions of several other Bacharach and David songs that later proved to be bigger hits for other musicians. "Reach Out for Me", "Message to Michael (Kentucky Bluebird)" (originally "A Message To Martha"), and "(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me" were all American hits, also produced by Bacharach and David, for Dionne Warwick. Several of his records reached the "Cashbox" R&B Top 20 including "Always" peaking at # 12 and "Reach Out" at # 15. In the UK, Johnson's version of "A Message To Martha" was his biggest hit, reaching # 36 in late 1964, but was outsold by the cover version by Adam Faith.
In 1965, working with the production team of Bill Giant, Bernie Baum and Florence Kaye on the reactivated Big Top label, Johnson recorded a vocal version of Sidney Bechet's instrumental hit of a few years earlier, "Petite Fleur", entitled "A Time To Love, A Time To Cry". He appeared on the British TV programme "Ready Steady Go!" to promote it, but neither it nor its follow-ups, a version of the jazz standard "Anytime" and then a version of "Walk on By" co-produced by Allen Toussaint, were successful, and the record company's choice of songs distanced him from his earlier audience. An album, also called "Anytime", went unreleased as the record company again collapsed. 
Johnson recorded two albums in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The first, "Sweet Southern Soul", for the Atlantic subsidiary Cotillion, was produced by the company's main R&B producer, Jerry Wexler, at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals. Allen Toussaint produced the second, "With You in Mind", at his New Orleans studio for Stax's Volt label, but neither proved successful. After moving to Orange County, California, Johnson became a nightclub entertainer. He sometimes performed in a latter-day version of The Ink Spots.
A CD retrospective of his recordings with Big Top/Big Hill Records in the 1960s, was put together by the UK label Ace/Kent Records in 2010. Although released in mono, it contained 'audio-restored' versions of all of his known recordings made at the time, including his work with Bacharach.

Point 175

Point 175 was a keenly contested feature in the Battle of Sidi Rezegh during World War II. The battle was fought mainly between Italian and New Zealand troops resulting in the near destruction of the New Zealand 2nd Division. 
Events of 29 November – 1 December 1941.
On the morning of 29 November 15th Panzer set off west travelling south of Sidi Rezegh. The remnants of 21st Panzer were supposed to be moving up on their right to form a pincer but were in disarray when Johann von Ravenstein failed to return from a reconnaissance that morning, having been captured. In the afternoon, to the east of Sidi Rezegh, the 21st Battalion of New Zealanders was overrun on the much contested Point 175 by elements of the Ariete Division. The New Zealanders were caught wrong-footed, having mistaken the attackers for reinforcements from the 1st South African Brigade which had been due to arrive from the southwest to reinforce XIII Corps. 
According to Lieutenant-Colonel Howard Kippenberger who later rose to command the New Zealand 2nd Division, ""About 5.30 p.m. damned 132 Armoured Division Ariete turned up. They passed with five tanks leading, twenty following, and a huge column of transport and guns, and rolled straight over our infantry on Pt. 175."" The 24th and 26th Battalions met a similar fate at Sidi Rezegh on 30 November and on 1 December a German armoured attack on Belhamed practically destroyed the 20th Battalion. The New Zealanders suffered heavily in the attacks: 880 dead, 1,699 wounded, 2,042 captured.
Meanwhile the leading elements of 15th Panzer reached Ed Duda but made little progress before nightfall against determined defences. However, a counterattack by 4th Royal Tank Regiment supported by Australian infantry recaptured the lost positions and the German units fell back to form a new position.
During 29 November the two British Armoured Brigades were strangely passive. 1st SA Brigade were to all intents and purposes tied to the armoured brigades, unable to move in open ground without them because of the threat from the panzer divisions.
On the evening of 29 November 1st SA Brigade was placed under command of 2nd New Zealand Division and ordered to advance north to recapture Point 175. Meanwhile, radio intercepts had given Eighth Army to believe that 21st Panzer and Ariete were in trouble and Lieutenant-General Ritchie ordered 7th Armoured Division to "stick to them like hell".
Following the resistance at Ed Dedu Rommel decided to withdraw 15th Panzer to Bir Bu Creimisa, to the south, and relaunch his attack northeast from there on 30 November aiming between Sidi Rezegh and Belhamed while leaving Ed Dedu outside his encircling pocket. By mid afternoon 6th NZ Brigade were being heavily pressed on the western end of the Sidi Rezegh position. The weakened 24th Battalion was overrun as were two companies of 26th Battalion although on the eastern flank of the position 25th Battalion repelled an attack from the Ariete moving from Point 175.
At 06.15 on 1 December 15th Panzer renewed their attack towards Belhamed supported by a massive artillery effort and once again the New Zealand Division came under intense pressure. During the morning 7th Armoured Division were ordered to advance to provide direct assistance. 4th Armoured Brigade arrived at Belhamed and may have had the opportunity for a decisive intervention since they outnumbered the 40 or so 15th Panzer Division tanks attacking the position. However, they believed their orders were to cover the withdrawal of the remains of 6th NZ Brigade and precluded an offensive operation.
The remains of 2nd NZ Division were now concentrated near Zaafran, five miles east of Belhamed and slightly further northeast of Sidi Rezegh. During the morning of 1 December Freyberg commanding 2nd New Zealand Division saw a signal from Eighth Army indicating that the South African Brigade were now to be under command of 7th Armoured Division. He drew the inference that Army HQ had given up hope of holding the Tobruk corridor and signalled mid-morning that without the South Africans his position would be untenable and that he was planning a withdrawal. Orders were issued by Freyberg to be ready to move east at 17.30. 15th Panzer, which had been resupplying, renewed its attack at 16.30 and the New Zealanders became involved in a desperate fighting withdrawal from its western positions. Nevertheless, the division, showing admirable discipline, was formed up by 17.30 and having paused an hour for the tanks and artillery to join them from the west set off at 18.45. They reached the XXX Corps lines with little further interruption and in the early hours the 3,500 men and 700 vehicles which had emerged were heading back to Egypt.

The Inter-City

The Inter-City was a British named express passenger train operated by the Western Region of British Railways (WR) between and via . It connected England's first and second cities, London and Birmingham. Introduced in 1950, the Inter-City can claim to be the origin of all later usages of the railway term "InterCity" (with or without a hyphen) worldwide.
In the winter 1959-60 timetable, the train became just one of an hourly all-day restaurant-car service between Paddington and Wolverhampton, as the WR service was ramped up to compensate for the absence of trains on the West Coast Main Line during electrification work on the latter.

Monster (2008 film)

Monster is a 2008 direct-to-DVD Japanese daikaiju film.
The film is a mockbuster created to capitalize on the release of "Cloverfield". It was released direct-to-DVD on January 15, 2008. "Cloverfield" was released theatrically three days later on January 18, 2008.
Plot.
The film takes place in Tokyo in 2003, where two reporters, Hana Izumi and Hyuga Kanata, have arrived to document unusual seismic disturbances that have been picked up around Tokyo. The disturbances are originally thought to be aftershocks left over from a supposed massive earthquake on the Kanto Fault that occurred two years previously, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and several hundred billion dollars in damage(possibly referencing the real-life Fukuoka earthquake or the Miyagi earthquake), although careful analysis of the evidence suggests otherwise.
As time goes on, all of Tokyo begins to suffer from abnormal earth tremors similar to those registered in 2005. The tremors are found not to be caused by an earthquake, but by a gigantic octopus that has been dormant for centuries. It has since been awakened by mankind and now sees Tokyo as a new feeding-ground; the filmmakers document the catastrophe as it unfolds.
It starts as Hana and Hyuga are talking about filming Tokyo. The scene then switches to the interior of Hana's car as the two drive to LAX, to catch their flight to Tokyo. In Tokyo they rent a hotel room, and, the next day, Hyuga films Hana talking with the global warming minister. During the interview, an earthquake strikes and the scene again switches to the reporters in the basement of the environmental building. They find a survivor named Aoyagi, and as they flee, they hear the sounds of panic and plane engines from a tunnel.
Later, they find a mall, and another earthquake occurs. In the chaos, Aoyagi is impaled by a pole as the reporters flee in panic. Some small text appears on the screen saying that tape #3 was damaged. As the reporters run toward a mall they find a woman and her grandfather, and they eat and sleep, Hana not realizing she had left the camera turned on. Then, another earthquake begins and kills the grandfather as the woman tells the reporters to flee. They hear the mall explode as they run away and soon find a building which they enter. They have gone upstairs when the building suddenly collapses. The reporters survive, but the collapse damages the camera lens.
Night arrives and they see helicopters ready to save refugees, but a tentacle destroys them and proceeds to throw cars at the people, killing many of them. Panic ensues, and Hyuga abandons Hana. A tentacle slams into the ground where Hyuga is and he is wounded. Additionally, the camera's batteries run low. Hana cries for Hyuga as the crash of a tentacle hitting the ground is heard, ending the film, which indicates that the reporters were crushed by the monster and were among the thousands, if not millions, killed.
Reception.
The few reviews of the film posted online have been extremely negative. Scott Foy of Dread Central did an audio file parody of the "found footage" concept used by the movie: in this case, the file consists of Foy giving his thoughts on the movie while at the same time pretending to be slowly going insane due to the movie's abysmal quality; it culminates in him apparently jumping out of a window. Foy would later state that some people actually thought his "insanity" was real and would also name "Monster" the "Worst Direct To DVD Horror Movie of 2008" in a later podcast.

Henry VI the Good

Henry VI the Good (also known as of Wrocław) () (18 March 1294 – 24 November 1335) was a Duke of Wrocław since 1296 (with his brothers as co-rulers until 1311). 
He was the second son of Henry V the Fat, Duke of Legnica and Wroclaw, by his wife Elisabeth, daughter of Boleslaw the Pious, Duke of Greater Poland.
Life.
Henry's father died in 1296, when Henry was two years old. Because he and his brothers, Bolesław III and Władysław (who was born after their father's death), were minors the regency of their lands was taken over by their mother, the Dowager Duchess Elisabeth (d. 1304) and their paternal uncle Bolko I (d. 1301). Between 1301–02 the official guardianship of Henry V's sons was carried out by Henry of Wierzbna, Bishop of Wroclaw. Finally the authority over the Duchy of Wrocław-Legnica was personally assumed by the King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Poland, which brought Bolesław III into his court in Prague. Is unknown what happened with Henry during this time. 
The first mention of Henry takes place in 1310 when he married the several years older Anna, daughter of Albert I of Habsburg, the ruler of Austria. A year later, as a result of the pressure of the nobility of both Wrocław and Legnica (tired of the neglected rule of Bolesław III), the Duchy was divided into three parts: Wrocław, Legnica and Brzeg. The poorest and least important was Brzeg. In the treaty of division, it was stipulated that the brother who takes this district would also receive from the other two a payment of 50,000 fines. As the oldest, Bolesław III was able to choose first; with financial problems, he unexpectedly took Brzeg and the monetary compensation. As a result, Henry was allowed to take Wrocław. He had no problems with paying the debt to his older brother (thanks to the help of the rich Wrocław patricians) and kept the district. The youngest brother, Władysław, who received Legnica, wasn't able to pay his part of the debt and for this was expelled from his land by Bolesław III.
Between 1312 and 1317, a conflict erupted between Bolesław III and the Dukes of Głogów. Henry and his brother entered into an alliance with the ruler of Lesser Poland, Władysław I the Elbow-high and with their combined forces began an expeditionary trip against Henry III's sons. As a pretext they used the fact that Henry III was directly responsible for the premature death of Henry V (Henry and Bolesław III's father). In the end, Władysław I the Elbow-high managed to capture almost all of Greater Poland, but his allies only took the towns of Uraz (which was given to Henry) and Wołów and Lubiąż (granted to Bolesław III).
In 1314 Henry supported his brother-in-law Frederick the Fair of Austria in the battle for the throne of Germany.
The war with Głogów began again in 1321. This time, however, Henry wasn't convinced as to the appropriateness of it, and in 1322 he signed a separated peace with the Głogów Dukes, receiving in return Smogorzew. The agreement was reinforced with the marriage of Henry's eldest daughter Elisabeth to Duke Konrad I of Oleśnica. 
By that time the relations between Henry and his older brother Bolesław III had seriously deteriorated. The reasons for this was Henry's refusal to support the overtly militaristic policy of his brother (as evidenced after he signed a peace with Konrad I of Oleśnica and his brothers) and Bolesław's pretensions to control the rich city of Wrocław. Bolesław even made an official proposal to exchange his district of Legnica for Wrocław. Henry refused this unfavorable transaction. The war between the brothers was imminent. 
Henry reestablished contacts with Władysław I the Elbow-high (now King of Poland), and promised him homage and named him his heir in exchange for aid against Bolesław. However, Władysław I feared a direct confrontation with the Kingdom of Bohemia and declined the offer. Subsequently, Henry asked Emperor Louis IV for help. On 20 April 1324, the Duke of Wrocław declared himself a vassal of the Empire; in return, Henry gained the right of succession over his lands for his daughters, and as a consequence, the disinheritance of Bolesław III and his descendants. These decision prompted Bolesław to carry out armed attempts to settle the dispute, but finally Bolesław failed due to the powerful walls of Wroclaw.
However, his homage to the Holy Roman Empire did not secure his lands, especially since the fights with Bolesław III continued. To remedy this, in 1325, Henry arranged the marriage of his second daughter Euphemia with Bolesław the Elder, Duke of Niemodlin (Falkenberg). He also entered into an alliance with the Teutonic Order, which was directed against the principal supporter of Bolesław in Silesia, the King of Poland, Władysław I the Elbow-high. 
Eventually, under pressure from the Wrocław nobility, Henry opted for an alliance with John of Luxemburg, King of Bohemia. The signing of the agreement took place in Wrocław on 6 April 1327. Under the terms of the treaty, Wrocław remained independent, but after the death of Henry would be adjoined to the Bohemian Kingdom. In return for these concessions, Henry obtain from the King the Kladsko Land (then northeastern part of Bohemia) for his lifetime and a high pension. 
In the matters of internal policy, Henry was constrained by the powerful Wrocław nobility, who received from him many privileges. His relation with the Church was very firm and tense, and in fact, between 1319-1321 he was excommunicated. 
Henry died on 24 November 1335 and was buried in the chapel of St. Hedwig in Wrocław.
Marriage and issue.
In 1310 Henry married with Anna (b. Vienna, 1280 – d. Wrocław, 19 March 1327), daughter of Albert I of Habsburg, Duke of Austria and widow of Herman, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel. They had three daughters:
On his death without male heirs and according to the treaty of 1327, Wrocław was merged into the Bohemian crown.

<doc id="21366800" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21366800" title="Dernbacher Feud">
Dernbacher Feud

The Dernbacher Feud (German: "Dernbacher Fehde") was an over one hundred year long (ca. 1230 - 1333) ongoing dispute in present-day Germany between the House of Nassau, several knightly families, and the Landgrave of Hesse. The conflict erupted mainly over property rights in Herborn and the surrounding area (the "Herborner Mark").
The feud was named after the knightly House of Dernbach, a powerful "Ganerbschaft" (jointly-owned inheritance) with almost sovereign rights. The Dernbachers, along with the Lords of Bicken (the present-day administrative center of Mittenaar), carried the primary burden of opposing Nassau’s quest for the territorial dominion of the area.
Beginning of the feud.
In the middle of the 12th century, the emerging House of Nassau greatly expanded its possessions. In 1231, it received the sovereignty over the "Herborner Mark" as a sub-fief from the Landgrave of Thuringia, who had be awarded it by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. As early as 1230, violent incidents between the local nobility and Nassau were reported. By the death of Count Henry ("Heinrich") II, the Rich in 1251, the feud was already in full swing.
The cause of the feud was the ambition of Nassau to curtail or take away the rights (including mining, hunting, and customs rights) and possessions (forests and ore mines in the Schelderwald) of the local aristocracy. The Landgraves of Thuringia and later of Hesse supported the local nobility. The leading figures of the lower nobility against Nassau were the Lords of Dernbach. Parallel with this conflict, Count Henry II was also fighting a vendetta against the Knight of Wilnsdorf in the Siegerland, who soon allied himself with the Dernbachers.
Not much is known about the fighting itself, but presumably it followed the usual pattern of feuds: essentially the looting and devastation of enemy possessions. At the beginning of the feud, according to tradition, Nassau destroyed a castle of the Dernbachers near Herborn, in the territory of the present-day borough of Seelbach, and the small Hessian castle of Lixfeld. However, historians cannot substantiate this allegation. In connection with the feud, Nassau constructed their first castle near Dillenburg and the Herborn Castle.
When the Countship of Nassau was divided in 1255 under Henry II’s sons Walram II and Otto I, the Dernbacher Feud had its first mention in the corresponding document. There are reports that sporadic fighting continued during the reign of Henry III of Nassau-Siegen (1270–1343). It must have been during this time that the Dernbachers received support from neighboring Lords of Bicken, who came to Hainchen.
By around 1250 the Landgraves of Hesse, who in regard to the "Herborner Mark" were the feudal lords of the Counts of Nassau, had also become involved in the feud. This was possibly in connection with the War of the Thuringian Succession. Landgrave Henry I built a castle at Eisemroth (the present-day administrative center of Siegbach) in 1307-1308 for protection against Nassau. On 9 November 1309, the Dernbachers sold their home castle, the small water castle Alt-Dernbach, to the new Landgrave Otto I and received it back as a fiefdom. This was presumably because its finances were heavily affected by the feud.
Otto undertook to further expand the castle, to bring the city under its protection to prevent it from falling into the hands of Nassau. Apparently, this allowed the Dernbachs to strongly assert themselves against Nassau again.
On June 26, 1312, Landgrave Otto I concluded an agreement with several members of the House of Nassau. It committed both sides in the future to no longer build castles against each other, and the Nassaus conceded that they could not restrict the rights are the Lords of Dernbach and Wilnsdorf. Afterwards the feud seems to have cooled somewhat, because by 1325 Nassau had bought some of the possessions of the Dernbachers, Bickeners, and the Bickeners of Hainchen, which brought them a stable power base, particularly in the court of Ebersbach (present-day Ewersbach in Dietzhölztal).
In 1325, the feud erupted anew with great hardship. In this time, among other things, the wooden castle of Nassau at Dillenburg was burnt down. Presumably in the same year Henry III of Nassau-Siegen destroyed the Castle (Alt-) Dernbach, the headquarters of the Dernbachers. The Castle Wallenfels, built by the Landgrave in 1320, was apparently surrendered in battle and came securely into Nassau’s possession (though later it had to be held “open” to the Landgrave). The Landgrave thus lost important bases in the disputed territory and so in 1326 built the new Hessenwald Castle, near the present site of Roth at the Heligenberg, strategically advantageously located on the remaining possessions of the Lords of Bicken, and likewise protecting the Breidenbacher area.
One of the major battles, lost by Hesse, took place in 1327 in Seibertshausen (a village on the Gladenbach Uplands, later abandoned and eventually incorporated into Weidenhausen, now part of Gladenbach). However, Landgrave Henry II of Hesse later won the battle on 10 August 1328 at Wetzlar, in which Count John of Nassau-Dillenburg (a son of Otto I) was killed.
End of the Feud.
With the loss of Dernbach Castle, the feud was lost for the knightly house based there. On 21 May 1333 it concluded a contract with Henry III of Nassau-Dillenburg, in which it sold all of rights in the Herborn and the "Herborner Mark" and many other rights in smaller settlements. The Dernbachers retained only the religious patronage rights and 13 courts in smaller villages. In 1334 Henry III of Nassau-Dillenburg was finally given Wallenfels Castle by Landgrave Henry II. On 30 July, a contract was once more concluded between Nassau and the Dernbachers, in which questions about the rights from the first peace treaty were clarified.
On 21 May 1336 an agreement was also concluded between the Lords of Bicken and Nassau, in which they sold Hainchen Castle (with the bulk of the property belonging to it) to the Count, but received rights to reign around Ebersbach.
In 1350, the Lords of Dernbach, with the help of the Lords of Bicken in Hainchen and with the support of the Landgrave, built the castle of New Dernbach in the Hessian territory of Blankenstein (Gladenbach). After the end of the feuds, the boundaries between Hessen and Nassau in the area were set, which remain still today as district boundaries.
On 21 April 1486, a Heidenrich of Dernbach sold his remaining serfs in the Nassau area to the local count for a low price. With this, the Lordship of Dernbach was finally transferred to Nassau.

Eliseo Grenet

Eliseo Grenet Sánchez (12 June 1893 in Havana – 4 November 1950) was a Cuban pianist and a leading composer/arranger of the day. He composed music for stage shows and films, and some famous Cuban dance music. Eliseo was one of three musical brothers, all composers, the others being Emilio (Neno'," 1901–1941) and Ernesto (1908–1981). Emilio went on composing even after having an arm and a leg bitten off by a shark in 1930; Ernesto was a drummer who became leader of the Tropicana's orchestra.
Life & work.
Eliseo studied music under Mercedes Valenzuela and Leandro Simón Guergué, the father of Moisés Simons. In 1905 he played piano in the silent film theatre "La Caricatura", and in 1909 directed the orchestra of the "Politeama Habanero" theatre, which mostly showed zarzuelas. Later he joined the company of Regino López at the "Teatro Cubano".
In 1925 Grenet founded a jazz band which played in the cabaret "Montmatre" and the "Jockey Club". The line-up included Grenet (piano); Manolo Castro (alto sax); José Ramón Betancourt (tenor sax); Pedro Mercado (trumpet); Jorge Bolet (piano sub); Enrique Santiesteban (percussion and singer). In 1927 came the premiere of the zarzuela "La Niña Rita, o La Habana de 1830" at the "Teatro Regina", with music by Grenet and Ernesto Lecuona. In this zarzuela, Grenet's number, the tango-congo "Ay, Mamá Inéz", became a huge hit, and remains popular today and is often heard at wedding receptions. Its origins lie in a comparsa number of 1868, and in its new guise became one of the signature numbers for the vedette Rita Montaner. In 1930 he set a number of Nicolas Guillén's poems "Motivos del son" to music.
Grenet left Cuba in 1932 after falling foul of some of Gerardo Machado's henchmen, for the lyric of his "Lamento cubano", which had the line:
He returned after Machado was forced out of office. Whilst abroad in Spain he directed the orchestra for the operetta "La virgen morena", in Barcelona. Next, in Paris, he directed the same work. In Paris, too, he played piano at La Cueva, the nightclub he partly owned, in the resident band of Julio Cueva. There he joined his brother Ernesto, who played percussion. It was here that playing "La comparsa de los congos", that he realized the potential of this carnival rhythm. It has been said that he introduced the conga to America, and this may or may not be true. The Lecuona Cuban Boys, a touring band, were writing and playing congas at the same time.
In 1936 he founded the night-club "El Yumurí", on Broadway and 52nd St, New York City. This which featured a local Puerto Rican group led by Pedro Flores, and a cabaret. In 1938 Grenet presented the review "La Conga" in his club, and later put on a spectacular at the "Teatro Hispano" in New York, with the leading Cuban singer Panchito Riset (Havana, 21 October 1911–New York, 8 August 1988).
Summary of main compositions.
Grenet wrote, arranged and sometimes directed music for a number of musical stage shows and films, and recorded for Columbia Records and Brunswick Records. Overall, his style and influence was part of the afrocubanismo movement between the two world wars.
Film music.
He wrote film music for "La Princesa Tam-tam", starring Josephine Baker (Paris); "Escandolo de estrellas", "Conga bar" and "Estampeas coloniales" featuring Miguelito Valdés, (México City); "Milonga de arrabal", (Buenos Aires); "Noches cubanas", (New York); and "Susana tiene un secreto", (Barcelona).
Lyric theatre.
Music for the following zarzuelas and other musical theatre: "La toma de Veracruz", premiered in 1914 in the Teatro Alhambra (Havana), "Bohemia", "Como las golondrinas", "El mendigo", "El santo del hacendado", "El submarino cubano", "El tabaquero" (libretto: Arquimedes Pous), "La camagüeyana" (premiered in Barcelona 1935), "La virgen morena", "Mi peregrina maldita", "La Niña Rita, o La Habana en 1830", music co-authored with Ernesto Lecuona.
Recorded pieces.
Grenet wrote, amongst many other numbers, "Las perlas de tu boca", "El sitierito", "Lamento esclavo", "Tabaco verde", "La comparsa de los congos", "La mora", "México", "La princesa tam-tam", "Papá Montero", "Rica pulpa", "Mi vida es cantar", "Lamento cubano", "Negro bembón", "Tu no sabe inglé", "Sóngoro cosongo", "Ay!

Pence Automobile Company Building

The Pence Automobile Company Building is a building in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was designed in the Classical Revival style by the Minneapolis architectural practice of Long and Long and built in 1909. The building housed sales showrooms and offices, automobile repair and service, and storage for parts, accessories, and finished vehicles. It was listed on the National Register as a commemoration of the extraordinary growth of the auto industry during the early 20th century.
The owner of the company, Harry Pence, was born in Springboro, Ohio. He moved to Minneapolis at age 18 to join his uncle, John Wesley Pence, who had various business interests in the area. In June 1902, Harry Pence attended an auto race between Minneapolis and Lake Minneapolis ("sic") and decided to go into business selling automobiles. He decided on selling the Cadillac based on his perceptions of its good service and reliability. His dealership was the second auto dealership in Minneapolis, and in 1903 he sold 83 cars. Pence eventually decided that automobiles should have larger engines than one cylinder, but Cadillac turned his idea down. Buick agreed to make a larger engine, so Pence switched to selling Buicks. Pence's dealership grew to sell, at one time, 29 percent of all Buicks that were being manufactured.
The building resembles the work of Louis Sullivan and George Grant Elmslie and other skyscraper pioneers. It has a common arrangement of a base, shaft, and column, with a rather plain shaft but a good assortment of detail around the base. The applied ornamentation around the base has classical sculptural details, but also has terra cotta ornamentation more in line with Louis Sullivan's work.

Otto Otepka

Otto F. Otepka (May 6, 1915 – March 20, 2010) was a Deputy Director of the United States State Department's Office of Security in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He was fired as the State Department's chief security evaluations officer on November 5, 1963; he had furnished classified files to the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. Otepka was later appointed by Richard Nixon to a position on the Subversive Activities Control Board; he retired in 1972.
Background.
Otepka was born in Chicago in 1915, and graduated from the Columbus School of Law. He served in the US Navy during World War II.
Career.
Otepka was a Deputy Director of the United States State Department's Office of Security in the late 1950s and early 1960s. This was at the beginning of the Eisenhower Administration and Otepka's "Evaluations" section was faced with Senator Joseph McCarthy who was at the height of his power and making accusations that Communists and Communist sympathizers had infiltrated the U.S. Army and U.S. Department of State. Otepka was assisted by another newcomer to the State Department, William L. Uanna, who would soon head up "Physical Security" at State. Otepka, Uanna and R. W. Scott McLeod, another newcomer in Security at State, were mentioned in a 1954 article in The Reporter (magazine) entitled "Big Brother at Foggy Bottom." The article describes how the State Department implemented Eisenhower's answer to McCarthy - Executive Order 10450 - and the reaction to it by State's employees. 
The Office of Security was often simply known as "SY" and in the 1980s became the Diplomatic Security Service. Otepka was in charge of vetting clearances for the State Department and he gained public attention when he was sidelined and then later fired by Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Otepka claimed he was punished for not clearing names proposed by the Kennedy administration for employment in the State Department. Some of these names had previously been banned during the Eisenhower administration, according to at least one source. Also, investigative journalist Clark Mollenhoff detailed the Otepka story in his 1965 book "Despoilers of Democracy". Mollenhoff noted that Otepka was punished and subjected to illegal surveillance for giving testimony to Congress about security procedures at the State Department, as much as for his concern about the rampant use of emergency clearances by the Kennedy adminsitration. Two officers, including Deputy Assistant Secretary John F. Reilly, perjured themselves before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and had to resign in November 1963. However, Senate efforts notwithstanding, Otto Otepka was relegated to a meaningless position before his termination. So were some of his colleagues who had backed his efforts.
By the late 1960s there was a Congressional hearing into the dismissal of Otepka but in the end Otepka was never returned to his previous station.
In March 1969 Otepka was appointed by Richard Nixon to a position on the Subversive Activities Control Board. After some difficult Senate confirmation hearings, the Senate confirmed his position.

British Refugee

British Refugee is a 7" single released by the 1970s Liverpool punk band The Spitfire Boys, on RKO Records on October 7, 1977. It was the only disc released by the most acclaimed line-up of the band, who comprised vocalist Paul Rutherford, guitarist David Littler, bassist Pete Griffiths and drummer Peter Clarke. At the time, they were one of the few punk bands from Merseyside who released a record, apart from Big In Japan and Chuddy Nuddies (later known as Yachts). Two months after its release, the band split up, but was reformed in Wales by 1979 by David Littler along ex-Nylonz members.
That line-up was known also for made more successful things in separate ways later. Paul Rutherford formed 1980's pop band Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Peter Clarke became known as Budgie and joined Big In Japan, Slits, and more famously Siouxsie and the Banshees, later marrying with Siouxsie Sioux in 1991, until 2007 when they divorced.
The original version of the single was originally issued without a picture sleeve, but it was later added for the German edition in 1978.
The A-Side of the single, the eponymous song "British Refugee" explained about the life of a Northern Irish immigrant in England, who escaped from the British occupation of his country, and lived poor working-class conditions. 
For the single each member was credited with nickname or stage name, so Rutherford was named as Maggot, Littler as Jones, Griffiths as Zero, and Clarke as Blister.

The Song of the Shirt

The Song of the Shirt is a poem written by Thomas Hood in 1843.
It was written in honour of a Mrs. Biddell, a Lambeth widow and seamstress living in wretched conditions. In what was, at that time, common practice, Mrs. Biddell sewed trousers and shirts in her home using materials given to her by her employer for which she was forced to give a £2 deposit. In a desperate attempt to feed her starving infants, Mrs. Biddell pawned the clothing she had made, thus accruing a debt she could not pay. Mrs. Biddell, whose first name has not been recorded, was sent to a workhouse, and her ultimate fate is unknown; however, her story became a catalyst for those who actively opposed the wretched conditions of England’s working poor, who often spent seven days a week labouring under inhuman conditions, barely managing to survive and with no prospect for relief. 
The poem was published anonymously in the Christmas edition of "Punch" in 1843 and quickly became a phenomenon, centering people’s attention not only on Mrs. Biddell's case, but on the conditions of workers in general. Though Hood was not politically radical, his work, like that of Charles Dickens, contributed to the general awareness of the condition of the working class which fed the popularity of trade unionism and the push for stricter labour laws. 
Following is the first stanza of the poem; for the complete text, see the external link below.
With fingers weary and worn,
With eyelids heavy and red,
A woman sat in unwomanly rags,
Plying her needle and thread – 
Stitch! Stitch! Stitch! 
In poverty, hunger, and dirt,
And still with a voice of dolorous pitch 
She sang ‘The Song of the Shirt!’

Cameron Inquiry

The Cameron Inquiry, formerly the Commission of Inquiry on Hormone Receptor Testing, is a Canadian public judicial inquiry into the conduct of the Newfoundland and Labrador Eastern Health authority. The inquiry is investigating whether Eastern Health was at fault in the reporting of erroneous and delayed test results to breast cancer patients between 1997 and 2005, and in then failing to report the full scope of these errors. The inquiry developed ramifications for regional and national politics as the opposition Liberal Party questioned why the regional Progressive Conservative Party government had not intervened sooner in the crisis, and said that former deputy health minister Robert Thompson, who had been appointed to chair the inquiry, should stand down, prompting Newfoundland and Labrador premier Danny Williams to accuse the Liberals of a smear campaign. The inquiry, chaired by Justice Margaret Cameron, was called in May 2007 and released a report in March 2009.
Background.
In May 2005 Eastern Health discovered errors in hormone receptor breast cancer test results from a histology lab in St Johns, Newfoundland. The tests were designed to register patients' hormone levels, and determine whether they could benefit from potentially life-saving hormone oncology treatments. The board commissioned the re-testing of results from up to 1,500 patients and alerted the office of premier Danny Williams of this development and of potential ensuing media interest. An hour after first contacting Williams's office, the board sent a second message with what communications director Karen Matthews described to the inquiry as a "stand-down" notice, saying the issue had been minimized; Matthews responded by withdrawing the office from high alert over the case. Former health minister John Ottenheimer told the inquiry that he wished to publicize the testing failures when they emerged in May 2005, but deferred to Eastern Health's request that he leave them to handle the affair internally.
After retesting, Eastern Health concluded that 383 patients had received erroneous results, of whom 117 required a change to their treatment programs In December 2006 the board held a series of media briefings on the hormone receptor test errors, downplaying the seriousness and extent of the problems.
Press reports.
In May 2007 the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) published reports showing that Eastern Health knew the error rate for the screening tests to have been around 42%, considerably higher than the figure they disclosed in the December 2006 media briefings.
The provincial government then called a judicial inquiry, commencing November 2007, into Eastern Health's actions.
Conduct of the inquiry.
The inquiry saw dozens of witnesses between November 2007 and October 2008. In May 2008 the provincial government questioned the length of time the inquiry was taking, with justice minister Jerome Kennedy suggesting that continuing with the tone, style, and procedure of the inquiry could cause the health system to collapse. Chair Margaret Cameron declined the government's application to prevent inquiry lawyers from cross-examining witnesses, which had been presented as an attempt to expedite the inquiry.
Opposition leader Yvonne Jones accused premier Williams of trying to "undermine" the inquiry by questioning testimony and witness examination procedures, including one occasion on which Williams described the inquiry in May 2008 as a "witch hunt." Jones also said that former deputy health minister Robert Thompson, a Progressive Conservative who had been commissioned to oversee the inquiry, had a conflict of interest and should stand down. Williams responded critically to what he called an attempt by Jones to smear senior public health officials.
Peter Dawe of the Canadian Cancer Society objected to Williams's perceived attempts to speed up the inquiry, saying that patients deserved a full investigation however long it took.
Inquiry report.
The inquiry finished hearing testimony in October 2008 and was due to report by March 1, 2009.
Lawsuit.
In 2007, after the revelation that Eastern Health had deliberately concealed the scope of the testing errors, hundreds of patients filed a class action lawsuit against Eastern Health over the affair. A 17.5 million dollar settlement was reached in 2009.

Siekiera, motyka

Siekiera, motyka (Polish for "Axe, Hoe") is a famous Polish military and street-level protest song from the period of World War II. It became the most popular song of occupied Warsaw, and then, of the entire occupied Poland. The song was inspired by an old humorous folk-tune performed already in 1917 with different and constantly changing lyrics, adapted for the army in a 1938 publication under a different title.
Creation.
The wartime lyrics of the song were created around August 1942 in Warsaw, by a member of ZWZ Anna Jachnina, young wife of an army captain from before the invasion. It quickly spawned many variants. In 1943 it was published in print by the Polish resistance underground presses, in the "Posłuchajcie ludzie... folks," book, one of the "bibuła" publications of Propaganda Commission ("Komisja Propagandy") of Armia Krajowa (Home Army). The music - and in part the lyrics - was based on an existing melody and the words of older songs.
Performance and influence.
Germans from late 1942 penalized singing of that song (and similar ones), but sung poetry, ballads and other patriotic songs would remain popular in occupied Poland throughout the period. "Siekiera, motyka" would remain the most popular patriotic, occupation period street song of occupied Poland.
The song tells about the life in occupied Warsaw. A notable theme of the song, particularly strong in some variants, was the criticism of German practice of "łapanka's", the street round-ups that carted off random passers-by to forced labor duties.
The song was reprinted in several books and discs after the German occupation ended. The song was also featured in a movie Zakazane piosenki ("Forbidden Songs") made in Poland in 1946.

Arthur Bell (journalist)

Arthur Bell (November 6, 1939 – June 2, 1984) was a journalist, author and LGBT rights activist.
Bell, an early member of the Gay Liberation Front and a founding member of the Gay Activists Alliance in New York City, wrote two books. "Dancing the Gay Lib Blues" was published in 1971 and he published "Kings Don't Mean a Thing" in 1978. Bell wrote his first piece for the "Village Voice" in 1969, an account of the Stonewall riots, a confrontation between police and the patrons of a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn that became a flashpoint of the Gay Liberation movement. He became a regular columnist in 1976 with his column "Bell Tells". 
Bell wrote a series of columns about a string of unsolved murders of gay people; these columns, along with the novel "Cruising" by Gerald Walker, were the inspiration behind the William Friedkin film "Cruising". Ironically, Bell wrote additional columns condemning Friedkin and "Cruising" after reading a leaked early screenplay, deploring what he viewed as its negative depiction of gay people and claiming that it would inspire violence against homosexuals. At Bell's urging, gay activists disrupted the filming of "Cruising" and demonstrated at theatres where the film was playing.
Bell met author Arthur Evans, at the time a film distributor, and the two entered into a relationship in 1964. They parted on bad terms in 1971 and Bell included an unflattering portrait of Evans in his book "Dancing the Gay Lib Blues". The two reconstructed their friendship and Bell dedicated his second book, "Kings Don't Mean a Thing", to Evans.
Bell died June 2, 1984 at the age of 44 from complications related to diabetes.

Louise Anne de Bourbon

Louise Anne de Bourbon, "Countess of Charolais" (23 June 1695 – 8 April 1758) was a French noblewoman, the daughter of Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé. Her father was the grandson of "le Grand Condé", while her mother, Louise Françoise de Bourbon, was the eldest surviving legitimised daughter of Louis XIV of France and his "maîtresse-en-titre", Madame de Montespan.
Biography.
Born at the Palace of Versailles, Louise Anne was the fourth child and third daughter of her parents. Her eldest sisters were Marie Anne Gabrielle Éléonore de Bourbon and Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon. She was baptised in the chapel of Versailles on 24 November 1698 with her brother Louis Henri and her sister Louise Élisabeth.
Louise Anne never married.
During the Régence of her cousin, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, she became romantically involved with the Duke of Richelieu, a grandnephew of Cardinal Richelieu. At the same time, the Duke of Richelieu also began an affair with Louise Anne's first cousin, Charlotte Aglaé d'Orléans, known at court as "Mademoiselle de Valois". The two cousins, rivals in love, would later both fight fiercely, but separately, for the liberation of the duke from his incarceration in the Bastille due to his participation in the Cellamare Conspiracy.
At one time, she was considered as a possible bride for her cousin, Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes, but she refused. Another proposed husband was the Duke of Chartres, the son of the Regent, and heir to the House of Orléans. His mother, however, wanted a more prestigious marriage for her son with a young German princess.
Voltaire, a friend of Richelieu, wrote the following verse concerning Louise-Anne:
As the years passed, Louise Anne constantly intrigued for political prominence. She would later help her cousin Louis XV in his search for new mistresses. It was common gossip at the time that Louise Anne was actually one of the king's former mistresses, while Louise Anne's older sister, Louise Élisabeth, introduced Madame de Pompadour to the French court in the 1740s.
Louise Anne's father died in 1710, eleven months after having inherited the title of "Prince de Condé" at the death of his own father. Her mother, who had built the Palais Bourbon in Paris, died in 1743 at the age of seventy. Since her first cousin, Louis d'Orléans, never had a daughter who survived into adulthood, Louise Anne became known at court by the style of "Mademoiselle", which she held from 1728 when Louis' daughter, Louise Marie d'Orléans, died at the age of one.
Louise Anne owned several estates. In 1735, she became the owner of the "Hôtel de Rothelin-Charolais" in Paris, which became her townhouse. She would later sell the lands at Vallery, in the Bourgogne province of France, which had been the traditional burial place of her Condé ancestors. She also owned various châteaux such as the one at Athis outside Paris. She later sold the estate of Charolais to the Crown and in return got land in Palaiseau, which further augmented her personal real estate holdings.
Louise Anne died in Paris, at the "Hôtel de Rothelin-Charolais", at the age of sixty-two. She was buried in the Carmelite Convent of the "Faubourg Saint-Jacques". Her brother, Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, and her two sisters, Marie Anne de Bourbon and Élisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon, were also buried there.

Carl Frederick Burke

Carl Frederick Burke (February 10, 1913 – September 1, 1976) was a Canadian aviator.
Early years.
Born at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on February 10, 1913, the son of Frederick and Agnes Kirkwood (Fraser) Burke. His mother died from the Spanish flu pandemic in 1919 when Carl was age 6, and in later life he would ensure that the Kirkwood name would be memorialized in both a street name in Charlottetown as well in a modern motor lodge he opened. Carl Frederick Burke started flying lessons at Saint John, New Brunswick in 1936, subsequently earning a commercial license and, in 1939, qualifying for an air engineer's certificate. In 1939, he became a pilot for Canadian Airways Limited (CAL) at Moncton, New Brunswick, during which he was involved in the air rescue of a pilot in Musgrove Harbor, Newfoundland, flying a ski-equipped de Havilland Dragon Rapide, and also recovered the bodies of Sir Frederick Banting, navigator William Bird and Wlliam Snailman.
He joined the Royal Air Force Ferry Command (RAFFC) after CAL was purchased by Canadian Pacific Air Services. In 1941, along with Josiah Anderson, he received a license to operate a scheduled commercial air service between Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island and Moncton and Saint John, New Brunswick. Following the death of Anderson, Burke opened his business, Maritime Central Airways, alone.
Maritime Central Airways.
Maritime Central Airways (MCA) went into operation on December 7, 1941, with a fleet consisting of a leased Boeing 247D and two purchased aircraft: Barkley-Grow T8P-1 and a Fairchild 24. At its launch, Burke was its primary pilot. He became a Member of the Order of the British Empire after his January 28, 1943 rescue of crew and equipment from a downed Avro Anson, which required that he land five times on an ice floe near Prince Edward Island. MCA had expanded by the end of World War II, but post-war recession required that Burke find supplementary income to keep his business aloft. Among other enterprises, MCA undertook the maintenance of Douglas DC-3 aircraft at RCAF Station Summerside, Prince Edward Island. In 1951, the company received a major contract with the Pinetree Project, a chain of military radar stations, that led to the airlifting of over 10,000 tons of equipment and over 100,000 passengers to the eastern Arctic over a span of three years. MCA also received a contract, in 1954, to assist in the eastern section of the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) constructed by agreement of Canada and the United States.
These contracts required MCA to expand. In 1953, it acquired two small Quebec company, Boreal Airways and Mont Laurier Aviation, which had become wholly owned subsidiaries by 1956, shortly after which they were merged into Nordair Ltd. In 1960, Burke's enterprise grew further with the purchase of Wheeler Airlines Ltd. His company then had an air route structure that stretched from St. John's, Newfoundland to Windsor, Ontario and north beyond the Arctic Circle, though there was a gap between Montreal and Moncton. It expanded internationally thereafter, before being divided in 1963. MCA was sold to Eastern Provincial Airways, though Nordair remained independent until a major share was sold to J. Tooley of Montreal in 1967.
Burke died at Boston, Massachusetts on September 1, 1976.

Romani people in Croatia

There have been Romani people in Croatia for more than 600 years and they are concentrated mostly in the northern regions of the country. The 2011 Croatian census found 16,675 Romani in Croatia or 0.4% of the population. In 2001, more than half of the Romani population was located in the Međimurje County and the City of Zagreb. Various estimates place the actual Romani population at 30,000-40,000, with some up to 60,000. A considerable number of Romani refugees in Croatia from the ethnic conflict in Bosnia.
In the 2011 census, the largest religious groups among the Romani were Catholics (8,299 or 49.77% of them), Muslims (5,039 or 30.22% of them) and Eastern Orthodoxy (2,381 or 14.02% of them).
There are more than 120 Romani minority NGOs in Croatia. One of the most prominent is Croatian Roma Union.
History.
Romani were first time mentioned in Republic of Ragusa in 1362 in some commercial records. Ten years later, Romani are mentioned in Zagreb, where they were merchants, tailors and butchers.
Various Romani groups have lived in Croatia since the 14th century.
In the Middle Ages Romani were part of cities population and they lived together with rest of population. According to "litteras promotorias", nomad Romani groups also get privilege to resolve independently all intragroup conflicts.
Maria Theresa and Joseph II with their regulations from 1761, 1767 and 1783 forbade Romani nomadic lifestyle, forced them to accept a local clothing code and language, made state regulations on personal and family names and they limited their choice of profession.
Large groups of Romani arrived in Croatia in the 19th century from Romania after abolition of Romani slavery in 1855.
World War II.
Many Croatian Romani, as well as members of other minority groups like Serbs and Jews, were murdered by the ustasha during World War II.
Culture.
Language.
Three groups of dialects of Romani language present in wider region are Carpathian Romani, Balkan Romani and Vlax Romani language.
Religion.
In the 2011 census, the largest religious groups among the Romani were Catholics (8,299 or 49.77% of them), Muslims (5,039 or 30.22% of them) and Eastern Orthodoxy (2,381 or 14.02% of them).
Romani in modern Croatia.
In the Republic of Croatia, Romani have remained largely marginalized, so the government has a programme to provide them with systematic assistance in order to improve their living conditions and to include them in the social life. According to a survey conducted in 1998, 70% of surveyed families at the time did not have permanently employed family member, 21% had one member, and 6% had two permanently employed members. An additional risk is poor housing conditions, inadequate water supply and electricity infrastructure in Romani settlements, poor health care and low average level of education.
In the Croatian parliamentary election, 2007, the Romani minority elected their first dedicated member of Croatian Parliament. In 2010, Romani were added to the preamble of the Croatian Constitution and thereby recognized as one of the autochthonous national minorities. They elect a special representative to the Croatian Parliament shared with members of eleven other national minorities. Since 2012 Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb introduced for the first time courses "Romani language I" and "Literature and culture of Roma".
Romani in Međimurje County.
According to estimates and available data, at the beginning of 2009 in Međimurje County lived about 5,500 Romani, which makes 4.7% of total population that made them largest national minority in county. According to Census 2011, 2,887 people (2.44%) declared themselves as Romani. Difference between Census and the actual situation can be explained by avoidance of Romani to declare their minority affiliation due to stigmatization. As example of this situation can be seen Donja Dubrava municipality that according to 2001 census didn't have a single member of Romani minority although at that time in municipality there were little Romani settlement with about 70 people "(that no longer exists)".
Altogether there are twelve settlements in Medjimurje with Romani minority. Concentration of Romani in some settlements, and is some cases in certain peripheral streets of some settlements and very small number of Romani in other settlements show territorial segregation of Romani in county. In more than half of Međimurje municipalities Romani are not present or are present in very small number.

Joseph II (Chaldean Patriarch)

Mar Joseph II Sliba Maruf (or "Youssef II Sliba Bet Macruf") was the second incumbent of the "Josephite" line of Church of the East, a little patriarchate in Full Communion with the pope active in the areas of Amid and Mardin in the 17th-19th century, thus being the Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church from 1696 to 1713.
Life.
Sliba Maruf was born in 1667 in Tel Keppe, Iraq, received first orders at fourteen and was consecrated bishop, without the previous consent of Rome, at the age of 24 in 1691 by Joseph I. He was chosen by Joseph I as his successor in 1694, but this appointment became effective only when Rome accepted his predecessor resignation in 1696. Thus Sliba Maruf was confirmed patriarch by Holy See on June 18, 1696, with the name of Joseph II.
As happened for Joseph I, his ministry had to face the strong opposition of the traditionalists. This forced him in 1708 to ask permission to Rome to resign and move to Italy, a request that was not granted. 
During the plague that spread from 1708 he distinguish himself for the help and the pastoral care he offered to the sicks until he too was infected.
Early in 1713 he choose as successor Timothy Maroge and died of plague a few months later in 1713 (or according to other sources in 1712) at the age of 46.
Works.
Joseph is remembered as Syriac and Arab writer and for having translated many texts from Latin. His "Speculum tersum" ("Book of the pure Mirror") was translated from Syriac into Latin by I. A. Assemani and is conserved in the Vatican Library.

Kazdanga Palace

Kazdanga Palace is located in the village Kazdanga (Polish and German "Katzdangen"), Kazdanga parish, Aizpute municipality, Latvia. The first manor house was made out of wood and the new palace was built in 1800-1804 in the late classical style, designed according to the project by the German architect J. G. Berlitz. Kazdanga established the first Latvian fish pond, now in operation for a number of important agricultural schools.
History.
The palace was built in the years 1800-1804 in the style of late classicism, built by the project of Johann Gottfried Adam Berlitz. There is stone bridge, leading to the palace. On the other side of the river there are remnants of the manor buildings; house of the servants, stables, house of the steward and barns. The palace was burned down by local peasants during the Revolution of 1905. However, German baron von Manteuffel renovated it by the project of Paul Schultze-Naumburg in 1907. The renovation of the Kazdanga palace became an important event for the development of the Neo-Classicism style. It was designed by the well known German architect and Neo-Classicism Paul Schultze-Naumburg. In contrast to scenic, borrowed forms, the architect declared a return to the Homeland tradition and accuracy.
The reconstruction of the Kazdanga palace demonstrated a new approach by the architect to the original image of the building. It is noteworthy that the palace, designed in about 1800, was one of the most splendid monuments of Classicism architecture in Courland. Its restoration served as a starting point for reevaluating both patterns of pure Classicism and local building traditions. Even elements of scientific restoration could be observed in the course of reconstruction. The principle of historical verity was important in designing the interiors and replicas of the furniture that had been destroyed.
During the First World War the palace was again devastated. It was rebuilt between 1925-1927. In 1930 the Kazdanga Agricultural Trade School was housed in the palace. The school is still situated there. Near to the palace is a house of chevaliers. It has well preserved interior, like baroque style stairs and ornamented parquet floor.

Nemesysco

Nemesysco is an Israeli company that sells voice analysis programs marketed for fraud prevention, the detection of emotion, stress management, and other purposes. The company's products have been put into use by insurance companies, call centers, banks and airports, but their use has raised questions about whether the underlying technology is based on pseudoscience.
History.
The company was founded in 2000 by Amir Liberman, an Israeli businessman with no college education or formal training in mathematics, computer science or speech science. Despite the founder's lack of experience in the field and what one journal described as the program's "amateurish" programming, the company's products have been put into service by insurance companies such as Admiral Group and Esure, the Waupun, Wisconsin police department and the Department for Work and Pensions in the United Kingdom.
The company describes its software as "honesty maintenance" software, with applications including its use in human resourcing during interviews to determine the honesty of the applicant.
But after spending 2.4 million pounds on tests over three years, the Department for Work and Pensions revoked its funding for the program, saying that it "couldn't confirm that it represented any good value for money."
The program was also used for a study looking for links between the vocal performance of company executives and their firms' future financial performance.
Nemesysco is represented and its products are marketed by V Worldwide in the United States and Digilog in the United Kingdom.
Assessments.
Government, academic and peer-reviewed studies have found major flaws in "layered voice analysis," the technique used by Nemesysco's products. A report for the U.S. Department of Justice assessing the program's ability to detect deception found that it "failed consistently," with high rates of both false positives and false negatives. A University of Florida study conducted a year earlier had found that LVA "misclassified the low-stress and truthful samples with great frequency."
A third paper, published in the "International Journal of Speech, Language and the Law", classified Nemesysco's programs as "charlatanry" and said that independent analyses had authoritatively debunked the company's claims because "the evidence against them is just too overwhelming to motivate any more reliability tests." The paper was pulled from the journal's website—but not withdrawn—after Liberman threatened to sue for libel, claiming that the researchers did not actually use his company's products.
That paper's findings were defended by David Beaver, a professor of linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin, who called Nemesysco a "bullshit lie detector company run by a charlatan."
A subsequent review, published in "Homeland Security Affairs", found results similar to those of the three previous studies, showing that Nemesysco's LVA software was "unable to detect deception above chance levels."

Fraise

Fraise (1988–2005) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 1992 Breeders' Cup Turf. 
Background.
Fraise was a bay horse bred by Allen E. Paulson. He was sired by Strawberry Road, the 1983 Australian Horse of the Year which Paulson acquired in 1986. His dam, Zalataia, acquired by Paulson in 1983, raced in France and the United States, notably winning the Grand Prix de Deauville and the Grade I Oak Tree Invitational Stakes.
Fraise, which is French for strawberry, was raced by Madeleine Paulson, who won the colt on a wager with her husband by beating him in a golf game.
Racing career.
Trained for racing on turf by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Bill Mott, Fraise did not race at age two but made ten starts in 1991 at age three, notably winning the Round Table Handicap at Chicago's Arlington Park. Age four was Fraise's best year in racing when he won five of his ten starts. He got his first Grade I win in the Sword Dancer Handicap at Saratoga Race Course. On October 31, 1992 the mile-and-a-half Breeders' Cup Turf was hosted by Gulfstream Park Racetrack in Hallandale Beach, Florida. Facing a top class international field, Fraise was sent off at odds of 14:1. He was up against the even-money favorite from Canada, Sky Classic, that year's winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Subotica, and two Epsom Derby winners, Dr Devious (1992) and Quest for Fame (1991). Ridden by Pat Valenzuela Fraise was in sixth place with half a mile to go, but made strong progress in the straight to win by a nose from the long time leader Sky Classic.
Fraise returned to racing at age five, winning the Grade II Pan American Handicap at Gulfstream Park in Florida and the Grade I Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack in California. At age six, Fraise won his second consecutive Pan American Handicap before being sold to Japanese interests.
Retirement.
In Japan, Fraise was raced only briefly before being retired to stud duty, at which he was unsuccessful. Eventually gelded, he was used as a lesson horse at the Olympic Riding Club in Chiba, Japan. In the summer of 2005, original owner Madeleine Paulson provided the Old Friends Equine retirement facility in Georgetown, Kentucky with a substantial gift to enable them to acquire the horse, bring him home from Japan, and look after him during his retirement years. 
On November 7, 2005, the seventeen-year-old Fraise died suddenly from a ruptured blood vessel in his abdomen. He was cremated and his remains were interred in the Old Friends Dream Chase Farm cemetery.

List of Mighty Avengers story arcs

Featured here is a chronological list of story arcs in the comic book series Mighty Avengers created by Brian Michael Bendis and Frank Cho. The series started after the Civil War cross over.
Brian Michael Bendis Era.
Ultron Initiative (Issues #1-6).
Set during The Initiative storyline, the new team is introduced with Iron Man, The Wasp, Black Widow, Ms. Marvel, Wonder Man, The Sentry, and Ares. The team is assembled to fight the Mole Man's creatures, while a series of natural disasters are reported around the world. In the heat of battle, Iron Man's systems are overloaded, morphing him into a beautiful woman who resembles Janet Van Dyne, The Wasp. It is she who figures out that this is the new and improved Ultron.
The Avengers battle Ultron, while Henry Pym is summoned by The Black Widow, who has taken over the direction of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ultron distracts The Avengers with multiple versions of Iron Man's armor, while she disappears from the battlefield to attack The Sentry's wife. When the Sentry discovers what Ultron has done, he battles her while Ares develops a plan to defeat Ultron with Ant-Man's help. Ares infects Ultron with a virus, which causes her form to revert to Tony Stark's body. The Sentry's wife is revealed to be alive, and Spider-Woman arrives at the end to warn Tony Stark about the Skrull invasion.
Venombomb (Issues #7-11).
In a cross over with "New Avengers", Spider-Woman reveals that Elektra was actually a Skrull in disguise. Tony Stark realizes this is a hint of a full-scale alien invasion. Spider-Woman joins the team, as The Avengers battle everyone in New York City, who have been transformed into symbiotes by a virus dropped from space after the Ultron attack. Iron Man discovers that the fallen satellite belongs to Victor Von Doom, so he gathers The Avengers and takes the fight to Latveria. Iron Man, The Sentry and Dr. Doom are sent into the past by Dr. Doom's time platform, and The Sentry battles The Thing, while Iron Man convinces Dr. Doom to return them to the present time. Once The Avengers return, they battle Dr. Doom and eventually arrest him for terrorist crimes against humanity.
Secret Invasion (Issues #12-19).
During the Secret Invasion crossover, the Mighty Avengers featured a different tie in story each month; each featuring a different character not necessarily in the Mighty Avengers Team.
Secret Invasion Epilogue (Issue #20).
This issue dealt with the aftermath of the Skrull invasion. Henry Pym deals with the loss of his wife The Wasp, while having to learn what has happened while he was imprisoned by the Skrulls (House of M, Civil War, the death of Captain America and World War Hulk). At his wife's funeral he takes his anger out at Tony Stark, before Thor takes him away to mourn in private.
Dan Slott Era.
Chaos Cascade (Issues #21-23).
With a series of events causing chaos around the world, the Scarlet Witch recruits a new team of Avengers while Hercules tries to do the same. Henry Pym becomes The Wasp, and the Scarlet Witch sends the Avengers to deal with the threat at Wundagore Mountain, where it becomes apparent that her brother Quicksilver is being used as a vessel for Chthon. Iron Man arrives after battling the Hulk in Wundagore and challenges The Wasp for leadership, but leaves after helping them to defeat Chthon. The new team led by The Wasp includes Hercules, Amadeus Cho, and the U.S. Agent, plus Stature and Vision from the "Young Avengers". It is also revealed that the "Scarlet Witch" is actually Loki in disguise, who is manipulating the Avengers in order to embarrass Norman Osborn.
Chasing Ghosts (Issues #24).
The Mighty Avengers become an international team, following information from the "Scarlet Witch" to dozens of hot spots around the globe. Quicksilver, who initially did not want to join, chases the Avengers from country to country in search of his sister, and eventually joins the team after helping them defeat Titan.
Mighty/Fantastic (Issues #25-26).
In escaping H.A.M.M.E.R. agents, Jocasta inadvertently untethered the Mighty Avengers' "PymPocket" base from reality, causing its dimensional doorways to slowly fade. Henry Pym contacts Reed Richards, hoping to borrow a device that had been left in the Fantastic Four's care by Bill Foster. Reed refuses, and Pym decides to have his team break in the Baxter Building and steal the device. Despite Reed's best attempts, Pym is successful, and manages to move the Pym Pocket to a new dimensional location. However, the degradation of the dimensional gateways requires Jocasta to be integrated into the system in order to hold it together.
The Unspoken (Issues #27-31).
While the rest of the team settles into their new base, "The Infinite Avengers Mansion", U.S. Agent and Quicksilver encounter The Unspoken in China. Quicksilver explains that The Unspoken was the Inhumans' former king, before he was deposed and banished by his cousin Black Bolt for his power-hungry ways. Before the two can act, The People's Defense Force (China's Superteam) accost The Unspoken, demanding he leave the country. The Unspoken responds by defeating them in an instant, prompting U.S. Agent to suggest calling not just their team, but all the Avengers teams to combat such a threat.
Meanwhile, Stature desires revenge against the Scarlet Witch for the death of her father and has lured the Young Avengers to assist her. Ronin (Clint Barton) follows them, also desiring revenge against "Wanda". During the fight, Wiccan uses his powers to break though Loki's illusion, but the villain retreats before he is fully revealed.
While Hercules and Amadeus call the other Avengers teams for help, USAgent, Quicksilver and the recovered Chinese heroes attack The Unspoken, who uses Xerogen Crystal powder to turn them into Alpha Primitives. The other Avengers (barring Osborn's groups) join the battle, but many of them also succumb to the powder's effects.
At the same time, Pym is exploring the outer reaches of existence. There, he encounters Eternity, who thanks him for saving his being from succumbing to the chaos wave, and tells him that he is the universe's Scientist Supreme. Upon his return to the universe, Pym marshalls the remaining Avengers, having Amadeus and Hercules infiltrate the "Slave Engine", which contains a supply of Xerogen Crystals, and disable it. Pym then uses the engine's chronal ray, used to accelerate the growth of the crystals, on The Unspoken, turning him into a weak old man.
Mighty/Dark (Issues #32-33).
Loki engineers the escape of Crusher Creel, manipulating him into raiding Project Pegasus, bringing Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers to the scene. He also takes on Scarlet Witch's appearance once more in order to bring the Mighty Avengers to the same place. As Osborn's group is in the middle of a press conference, he can not afford to fight Pym's publicly popular team, and grudgingly joins forces with them. Creel then appears, having absorbed the power of a Cosmic Cube fragment. As their two teams attempt to stop Creel, Pym and Osborn both realise that Creel's wrecking ball, which shares his powers, has also turned into a Cosmic Cube, and race to retrieve it. Osborn is first, but Pym tricks him into believing that he had already gotten it, claiming that the Dark Reign was made possible by the Cube's power. Pym then knocks Osborn out, and uses the Cube as a weapon against Creel, with limited results. Loki then appears, and provides Osborn with a mystical blade, which has the ability to remove Creel's Asgardian-born powers. Using the weapon, Osborn defeats Creel, making himself look like a hero in the eyes of the watching media. Osborn uses his status as head of H.A.M.M.E.R to decommission USAgent, removing him from the Mighty Avengers. Pym's Avengers return to the Infinite Mansion, where Pym consoles himself with the fact that he recorded Loki's image, and now has a scan of his retina.
Pre-Siege Mentality (Issue #34).
Hank Pym is finally forced to tell Pietro that the "Scarlet Witch" is actually Loki in disguise. Desperate to find out where Wanda is, Pietro joins the team in an attempt to capture Loki. The Mighty Avengers go to the Isle of Silence, to a palace where Loki makes an annual pilgrimage. When Loki arrives, he is captured by device designed by Pym, which manages to nullify his magic, trapping him. Pietro demands to know where Wanda is, using Pym's device to torture Loki when he claims not to know. Loki mentally calls Thor for help, who briefly battles the Mighty Avengers. Pym agrees to release Loki, in return for him truthfully answer Pietro question. Loki truthfully answers that he does not know where Wanda is. Pym then requests that Loki join his team, to the shock and disgust of the others. Loki declines, and is taken by Thor to Balder, and the rest of the team decide to leave, believing Pym has gone too far. Back at the Infinity Mansion, Jocasta, who has been experiencing problems with her duplicate bodies, is overwhelmed by the programming of Ultron, her eyes glowing red.
Salvation (Issue #35-36).
Ultron is shown to infiltrate Jocasta and the Infinite Avengers Mansion. He names himself Ultron Pym and seeks to kill and replace his father before using his Infinite Mansion to conquer the universe. Amadeus Cho, now on his own after the death of Hercules, receives word that the Thunderbolts have been sent by Norman Osborn to steal a powerful spear belonging to Odin. He calls on U.S.Agent, Stature and Vision for help stopping them. Pym is eventually able to make Ultron leave by marrying him to Jocasta.

Daphne Rooke

Daphne Marie Rooke (née Pizzey) (6 March 1914 – 21 January 2009 ) was a South African author of works such as "Mittee", "Ratoons" and "Wizards' Country". She also wrote travel articles and books for children set in India, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
Biography.
Daphne Rooke was born in Boksburg, Transvaal; the youngest of six children born to an Afrikaaner mother. Daphne's grandfather was Dietlof Siegfried Maré, founder of Pietersburg, who had 23 children by two wives. One of Daphne's uncles was writer Leon Maré.
Daphne's mother was Maria Magdalena Maré, born in 1878, who was known as "Mittee". She married an Englishman, Edward Knevitte or Knevitt in 1899. During the Anglo-Boer war, tensions between Afrikaans and English ran high, and the couple and their four children (Daphne's three half-brothers and a half-sister) were forced to leave Pietersburg because of Knevitt's English citizenship. The Marés and Knevitts apparently had little contact after this time.
After the death of Edward Knevitt, Daphne's mother remarried to another Englishman, Robert Pizzey, in 1911, and had two further daughters: Rosemary born in 1912 and Daphne born in 1914. Robert Pizzey fought and died in the First World War. As a child, Daphne had recurring heart and growth problems. Primarily for the sake of Daphne's health, the family left the Highveld and moved near to Durban Natal. Daphne's mother was a teacher and a journalist, and also a short-story writer. She published a collection of short stories "The Children of the Veld", under the pseudonym "Mare Knevitt".
This inspired Daphne to try her hand at writing. She became a journalist and author. In 1946, she was co-winner of the "Afrikaanse Pers" literary prize, for a work that was eventually published as her first novel, under the title ""A Grove of Fever Trees"". In the meantime (1937) she had married an Australian named Irvin ("Bertie") Rooke, whom she had met while doing organizational work for the Transport Workers Union. To reconnect with Bertie's Australian family, they left for Australia in 1946. They returned to Natal in 1953, but disturbed by the police state mentality in South Africa, moved back to Australia in 1965. In the 1980s her work was "rediscovered" by the University of Natal, which awarded her an honorary doctorate in 1997. She remained in Australia until Bertie's death in 1989 when she moved to Cambridge, England, where she lived for the rest of her life.

Diamond in the Dunes

Diamond in the Dunes is a feature-length documentary produced by the Documentary Foundation about a Chinese-Muslim baseball team in Xinjiang Province, China.
The film.
The documentary tells the story of Parhat Ablat, a young Muslim ethnic minority from the deserts of Western China, who leads the fight against racial segregation through baseball.
The population of Xinjiang Province, China is divided between two ethnic groups: the indigenous Muslim Uyghurs and the ruling Han Chinese, who gained control of the region in 1755 from the Dzungar kingdom. Uyghur and Han speak different languages, practice different religions, live and work in different neighborhoods, and even set their watches two hours apart―Han operate on Beijing time, Uyghurs on unofficial local time.
There is one place, however, where the segregation line is broken: on the baseball ﬁeld. Although Uyghur and Han Chinese students at Xinjiang University take separate classes and live in separate dormitories, there are not enough players of one or the other ethnicity to ﬁeld a whole team. They need each other to play baseball.
"Diamond in the Dunes" follows this team and their charismatic captain, Parhat Ablat, in their struggle to overcome ethnic differences and prepare for their only game of the season: an all-in match up against a team of Tibetans from Qinghai Province.
Summary and background.
"Diamond in the Dunes" opens with pastoral shots of Parhat Ablat, a young Muslim Uyghur, farming and herding sheep on his homestead outside Kashgar. Parhat says goodbye to his family and gets on the train for Urumqi, the capital of China's Xinjiang Province, where he attends university.
The population of this hardscrabble region is divided between two ethnic groups: the indigenous Muslim Uyghurs and the ruling Han Chinese, who gained control of the region in 1755 from the Dzungar kingdom. Uyghur and Chinese speak different languages, practice different religions, live and work in different neighborhoods, and even set their watches two hours apart―Chinese operate on Beijing time, Uyghurs on unofficial local time.
Parhat, pitcher and captain of Xinjiang University's baseball team, explains that classes and dormitories at Xinjiang University are segregated, but on baseball team, both Uyghur and Chinese students play side-by-side. When a package of donated baseball equipment arrives from the US, Parhat shares his excitement with Yusufu, one of his Chinese teammates.
During Xinjiang's brutal winter, the team begins to practice underground and racial tensions between Uyghur and Chinese come to a point. Parhat must bring both sides of the team together and remind them that if the conflict persists, the team may be disbanded by the University.
On and off the field, Parhat's goal is to raise poor Uyghur students out of what he calls the Uyghurs' 'spirit sickness.' He teaches quantum mechanics to a class of Uyghur physics students, counsels the younger players on the team, and starts a baseball team at the local elementary school.
At the end of the season, the Xinjiang University team is invited to compete against the next-closest baseball team, the Qinghai Tibetan College, more than 2,000 miles to the east. On the train, the novice players brush up on the strike zone and force out rule.
Finally, both teams face off for their only game of the season. The Xinjiang team plays hard, but Tibetans are too strong: the final score is 16-0. After the game, the mood is dour and the players look to Parhat for leadership. He assures them that the experience of defeat is important and a lesson can be learned: work hard, never forget your goals, and you will ultimately succeed.
The final sequence takes us back to Parhat's village. At sunset, he goes into the streets in his baseball uniform, finds a group of kids, and begins teaching them baseball. Night falls and the kids ask his name. "Parhat," he says, which in Uyghur means 'hero.'
Drawing from more than 100 hours of material, the film employs the cinéma vérité style, with no oncamera interviews or outside narration. The film favors a personal and psychological, rather than overtly political approach. The score is drawn from 100 minutes of Uyghur folk music, and includes drones extracted and reconditioned from the folk melodies and other sound design elements by Thomas Park of the musical act 'Mystified'.

Karol Jets

Karol Jets (Born 15 October 1980 in Spiska Nova Ves, Slovakia) is a professional ice hockey player currently living and playing in the United Kingdom.
Jets' ability was spotted from an early age where he was "sports streamed" at Grammar School until the age of 14 where he then attended the local High School while still training and playing Junior Hockey for Spisská Nová Ves.
He progressed through the junior system to play for the senior team in 00-01 and in 01-02 the team earned promotion to the Slovak Extra league for the 02-03 season. Management decided to draft in a more experience squad for the season and Jets moved to Trebišov. However, the strategy to bring a more experienced team backfired as halfway through the season Spiska found themselves at the bottom of the league. He was later brought back to Spiska for the rest of the season. On his first game in the Slovak Extraliga Jets accomplished the rare achievement of scoring twice on his league debut and consequently headlined the local Sports Pages.
Spiska were unable to turn the season around and again were back in Liga 1 for the 03-04 season. On making a move Dragon Presov for the 04-05 he found himself getting little ice time and again made the return to his home team to finish the season.
In 2005 he made a move to the UK playing for the Telford Tigers in the ENPL where he finished the season in the top 10 points scorers. Staying in the UK he moved to the Solihull Barons for the 06-07 season where he finished the teams top points scorer and stayed faithful to the team, turning down the opportunity to move to the injury struck Guildford Flames.
With Solihull making the decision not to continue in the EPL, he returned to Telford for 07-08 where he found himself fulfilling a more defensive role as a centre man for the defender light Tigers.
Jets decided that Hockey would not be his main priority for the 08-09 season and played for the Telford Titans in the ENL N2 where he has been instrumental in their fight for promotion.
Jets has decided that for the 10-11 season he will continue to play for Telford Titans - now in the ENL N1 league and - continue his job as Roarie the Tiger for home Tigers matches.

N-group (category theory)

In mathematics, an "n"-group, or "n"-dimensional higher group, is a special kind of "n"-category that generalises the concept of group to higher-dimensional algebra. Here, "n" may be any natural number or infinity. The thesis of Alexander Grothendieck's student Hoàng Xuân Sính was an in-depth study of 2-groups under the monniker 'gr-category'.
The general definition of "n"-group is a matter of ongoing research. However, it is expected that every topological space will have a "homotopy "n"-group" at every point, which will encapsulate the Postnikov tower of the space up to the homotopy group πn, or the entire Postnikov tower for "n" = ∞.
The definition and many properties of 2-groups are already known. A 1-group is simply a group, and the only 0-group is trivial. 2-groups can be described using crossed modules.

The Roberta Martin Singers

Career.
The Roberta Martin Singers were an African-American gospel group based in the United States. The group was founded in 1933 by Roberta Martin, who in that same year had just become acquainted with the then new trend of Christian music known as gospel, which was different from the traditional spirituals which were popular at the time. Theodore Frye and Thomas A. Dorsey were directing a junior choir at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Chicago, Illinois, and asked Martin to serve as the accompanist. From this junior choir, Martin selected six young men at random to form a group, Eugene Smith, Norsalus McKissick, Robert Anderson, Willie Webb, James Lawrence, and W.C. Herman (who lost his life in World War Two). This group was named the Martin and Frye Singers, and in 1936, the group adopted the name of The Roberta Martin Singers. The Roberta Martin Singers (RMS) were well known for their unique sound, which contained no traditional bass, but a dark treble sound with the elasticity that the new music required. For a brief period of time, the group was known as the Martin and Martin Singers, when Sallie Martin joined Roberta's group. That venture was short lived. In 1939, Anderson briefly left the group and returned in 1941 before departing for a final time in 1943, also in 1939, Martin added the first female voice to the group, Bessie Folk.
By the mid-1940s, the RMS added two more women to their ranks, Sadie Durrah and Delois Barrett (Campbell), who would go on to found The Barrett Sisters. The group toured the nation to great acclaim. The group's style of singing was different from most other gospel groups of the time. Whereas most groups would harmonize, each group member sang the song as if they were singing a solo, allowing the listener to be able to pick out each voice singing in the background. The RMS was also one of the first groups to have every member serve in capacity of being not only a background singer, but a soloist as well. In 1947, the group made their first recording for Fidelity Records as the "Roberta Martin Singers of Chicago", singing "Precious Memories" with Norsalus McKissick on lead.
After the group's first release, the RMS made more recordings, for Religious Records of Detroit, Michigan through 1947, and for Apollo Records beginning in 1949 through 1955. Some of their most popular releases during this time include "Old Ship of Zion" (1949), "Yield Not To Temptation" (1947), "He Knows How Much You Can Bear" (1949), "Only a Look" (1949), and Eugene Smith's composition, "The Lord Will Make a Way" (1951). Most of these recordings featured only a piano, organ, and the occasional drum accompaniment. Martin's piano playing was done in such a way that she combined both European classical and black bluesy elements of piano playing. Martin played mainly in the middle of the keyboard, providing secondary beats in the upper ranges of the keyboard, and bringing each song to a ritard at the end. This, combined with the group's unique voices resulted in their trademark "Roberta Martin Sound." In 1949, Eugene Smith became the group's business manager and booking agent as Martin began to focus more attention on running her school of music and publishing music. More members were added to the ranks, or replaced older members, such as the addition of Romance Watson in 1949, and Myrtle Scott and Myrtle Jackson in 1951. Martin also began to team up with a young James Cleveland, who composed songs for the group such as "I'm Determined" (1953), "Every Now and Then" (1957) and "Since I Met Him" (1961). Some members left to form their own groups or to sing in other groups. Willie Webb left to form the Willie Webb Singers in 1949, but returned to the group in 1953. In late 1950, Norsalus McKissick and Bessie Folk teamed up with James Cleveland to form The Gospelaires. The Gospelaires didn't last long, and McKissick was back with the RMS by 1951, Folk by 1955. In 1956, more changes were made to the group. Willie Webb, who had served as a singer and organist for the group prior to 1949 and during 1953-1956 left, and was replaced by Lucy "Little Lucy" Smith (Collier), Martin's step daughter. Smith had previously been featured as the organist on their 1949-1952 recordings and would occasionally vocalize with the group. This time, her stay with the group would last over a decade. Smith's singing would become more substantial, becoming a regular background vocalist and soloist in 1957. Beginning in 1959, Smith would occasionally leave the organist's duties to the Savoy studio organist and accompany the group on the piano during recording sessions. Smith's organist skills were so popular that in 1962, Savoy released an LP of gospel instrumentals with Smith's organ as the only accompaniment titled "Little Lucy Smith At the Organ." By 1963, Smith replaced Martin as the regular pianist and musical director on their recordings. Gloria Griffin was brought on board in 1957 to replace Bessie Folk, who'd been involved in a serious auto accident and could not sing in the group as a result. With these new members, the group began recording for Savoy Records. Their first session with Savoy was on January 31, 1957 in New York City. In 1958, the RMS scored their first big hit with Savoy records, "God Specializes" featuring Gloria Griffin on lead. 1958 also brought Archie Dennis into the group as a replacement for Romance Watson, as Watson began a solo career recording Soul music for Coral Records. Dennis made his debut with the RMS at a program accompanying the Reverend C.L. Franklin in a weeklong revival at the Music Hall in Houston, TX. The first recording session to feature Dennis with the RMS wasn't made until 1959. Later that year, Dennis left the RMS to serve in the US Army. Dennis's place was taken by Harold Johnson until Dennis was honorably discharged in 1961 and returned to the group. In 1962, former member Bessie Folk returned to the RMS to record with them on their album titled "Out of the Depths." During 1963, Bessie Folk left for a final time to join the Sallie Martin Singers, the RMS recorded their first Live album and made their first Transatlantic trip to sing at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. During their time with Savoy, the group made more popular recordings, including "Grace" (1958), ""Hold The Light" (1959), "No Other Help I Know" (1962) and "There Is No Failure In God" (1963), among others.
By the mid-1960s, the pace of the group, like many other groups dating from the golden era, was beginning to slow down. Delois Barrett-Campbell left the group in 1966 with Roberta Martin's encouragement, to embark on an independent career with The Barrett Sisters. She was replaced by Louise McCord. Gloria Griffin departed the group in 1967 to embark on a solo career, as well. Earlier in the decade, Martin ceased playing piano for the group, and Lucy Smith became the group's accompanist and musical director. Under the direction of Smith, the sound of the group began to change slightly, as song arrangements become more choral sounding in nature, drum beats became more prevalent than in previous recordings, and the electric bass guitar was added. It was also during this time that Roberta Martin became ill. Martin retired the group for a short period of time in the mid 60's, though the group came together in 1968 to record an album titled "Praise God". Barrett-Campbell returned to the group for the session, as did Martin, and new group member, Catherine Austin. Martin had experienced a short rebound from her illness and was able to lead one song on the album titled "I Have Hope", which was written by Jessie Jimerson aka Jessie Phillips, a longtime friend of Roberta Martin & childhood friend of James Cleveland. Shortly after the recording, Martin's health took a severe decline, which effectively made "I Have Hope" the last song she ever recorded. On January 18, 1969, Roberta Martin died of cancer. Without their leader, the Roberta Martin Singers tried to continue, but eventually disbanded in 1970. It has been reported that in the months leading up to her death, Martin refused to take strong painkillers.
Life after Death (1969-present).
"After Martin's death and the disbanding of the group, the former group members began to focus their attention on solo careers and careers with other groups. Delois Barrett-Campbell began working full time with her group, The Barrett Sisters, and sang with them regularly until her health began to decline around 2006. Louise McCord recorded material with Rev. James Cleveland and the Voices of Tabernacle in the late 60s before embarking on a solo career recording for Stax, and was featured in the Wattstax concert of 1972. After her time with Stax, McCord went on to record for Savoy. Gloria Griffin released her first solo album in 1967 for Atlantic Records, and worked with Rev. Donald Vails in the following decades. Willie Webb became the accompanist for the Chicago based "Rock of Ages" television program during the 1970s and 1980s. During the early 1970s, Lucy Smith Collier became the accompanist for the Chicago based "Jubilee Showcase" television program. In the mid or late 1970s, Collier suffered a stroke which paralyzed her on one side, rendering her unable to play the piano or organ. Collier's stroke did not diminish her singing ability, and she continued to sing and record occasionally until the 1990s. Archie Dennis toured and sang with the Rev. Billy Graham Association from 1972-1977 before founding his own church in 1986.

More reunion concerts followed into the 1990s, featuring members such as Norsalus McKissick, Eugene Smith, Delois Barrett-Campbell, Gloria Griffin, and Romance Watson, with one 1993 performance featuring Richard Smallwood again serving as accompanist.

Yoel Hoffmann

Yoel Hoffmann (born 1937) is a contemporary Israeli Jewish author, editor, scholar and translator. He is currently a professor of Japanese poetry, Buddhism, and philosophy at the University of Haifa in Israel and lives in Galilee.
Biography.
Born in Braşov, Romania to Jewish parents of Austro-Hungarian culture, at the age of one Hoffmann and his parents fled a Europe increasingly under Nazi influence for the British Mandate of Palestine. Shortly after the move, Hoffmann's mother died and he was entrusted by his father to an orphanage where he spent his time until his father re-married.
As a young man, Hoffmann left his home in Israel and traveled to Japan, where he spent two years living in a Zen monastery and studying Chinese and Japanese texts with
monks. He would later return to Japan to earn his doctorate. Hoffmann did not begin writing fiction until in his forties, and though chronologically a member of the sixties "Generation of the State," his work is oft-described as being on the forefront of
avant-garde Hebrew literature.
Hoffmann's first book of fiction, "Kätzchen - The Book of Joseph", was published in Hebrew in 1988. He has since gone on to write nine more books in Hebrew, six of which have been translated into English and published by New Directions; these six are "Katschen and The Book of Joseph" (1998), "Bernhard" (1998), "The Christ of Fish" (1999), "The Heart is Katmandu" (2001), "The Shunra and the Schmetterling" (2004), and "Curriculum Vitae" (2009). Hoffmann was awarded the first ever Koret Jewish Book Award, as well as the Bialik Prize by the city of Tel Aviv and the Prime Minister's Prize.
The rights to Hoffmann's latest book, "Moods", were sold to Galaade publishing company in France and to Keter Books in Israel in 2010.

Termit Massif

The Termit Massif (Termit Mountains or simply the Termit) is a mountainous region in southeastern Niger. Just to the south of the dunes of Tenere desert and the Erg of Bilma, the northern areas of the Termit, called the Gossololom consists of black volcanic peaks which jut from surrounding sand seas. The southern Termit is a roughly east-west range of heavily eroded black sandstone. Its foothills on the south west are the Koutous hills.
Human settlement.
The small population of the Termit is mostly nomadic, with Toubou settlements in the north and east, and more Tuareg and Diffa Arabs to the west. Covering much of the north of the Zinder and Diffa Regions, there are few permanent settlements or all weather roads in the area. Communities within the region include Termit Kaoboul in the south centre and Kandil Bouzou in the southeast. Neighbouring settlements include Tasker, Abourak and Haltouma to the southwest; Béla Hardé to the southeast, and Koussa Arma, Oyou Bezezé Denga, and Agadem on the eastern fringe. Settled communities on the south west fringe are largely Hausa, and to the south east Kanuri. The large Kanuri town of N'guigmi is to the southeast and the Hausa cities of Goure and Zinder are to the southwest.
Ecological protection.
Termit is home to the Termit Massif Reserve, a 700,000 hectare faunal reserve established in 1962 to protect endangered antelope and Addax populations.
In 2006, the government of Niger applied to UNESCO to have the Termit Massif area named a UNESCO World Heritage site.
First Sub-Saharan Region to enter the Copper Age.
The earliest dating of iron in Sub-Saharan Africa is 2500 BC at Egaro, west of Termit, making it contemporary to the Middle East. The Egaro date is debatable with archaeologists, due to method used to attain it. The Termit date of 1500 BC is widely accepted.

The Roots of Evil

The Roots of Evil: "A Social History of Crime and Punishment" is a book written by Christopher Hibbert in 1963 which traces the development of the social justice system, mostly from an English perspective, though information about the continent and the United States is also included.
Overview.
With this conclusion, Hibbert traces the development and decline of cruel punishments, the guillotine in France and the modern prison in England, which still used hanging when the book was first published. The chapter Causes and Cures contains the salient point that "There seems, indeed, no surer way of keeping a boy girl from a life of crime than providing him with a happy and worthwhile childhood in a family which loves him and which he loves", and suggests that while "a crime is only a crime when a law ... makes it so", pointing out that by the nineteenth century nine of the ten laws which Hebraic law punished with stoning "had ceased to be offences in civilized European societies". Although "Drink and drugs and speed and sex are exciting, and so is crime and in cities the opportunity for crime are extensive and the rewards are high, the chances of escape are greater and most of the police are overworked and some of them may be corruptible." While it is suggested that to change crime requires changing society, the last sentence of the chapter is "No completely satisfactory answers have yet been found."
The last chapter, Progress and Palindrome, points out that "the solution lies not in making punishments more severe, but in making them more certain and in relating them to each individual criminal, so that if he is reformable he may be reformed." Also, "there are germs of evil in the best of us and seeds of good in the worst", and there are no quick and inexpensive solutions to the problem of crime, which requires changing the soil, more than changing the seeds.

Alarm Forest

Alarm Forest is one of the smaller of the eight districts of Saint Helena, in the northern part of the island of Saint Helena, southeast of Jamestown. In 2008 it had a population of 276, compared to a population of 289 in 1998.
The district was created between census years 1987 and 1998 from parts of Jamestown and Longwood. There is no settlement by that name, however. The main settlement is Briars Village, with the community centre of the district. The village is located at the high point of the Side Path, a steep road leading out southward on the eastern slopes of Jamestown valley. Briars Village, but not the rest of the district, is considered a suburb of Jamestown. The village has few amenities of its own, and the population looks to nearby Jamestown for shopping and entertainment. The village is also home to the island's headquarters of Cable and Wireless, with its large satellite dishes, which connect Saint Helena to the outside world. The upper part of the village, "The Briars", is a newer settlement of relatively wealthy citizens.
Also Seaview, Two-gun Saddle and Hunts Vale are part of Alarm Forest. Another area of settlement is Alarm Hill, where the historic Alarm House is. Napoleon's tomb is located in Sane Valley in the district. Napoleon had selected this spot as his burial site during one of his walks.

<doc id="21368293" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21368293" title="Interstitial keratitis">
Interstitial keratitis

Interstitial Keratitis (IK) basically means corneal scarring due to chronic inflammation of the corneal stroma. Interstitial means space between cells i.e. corneal stroma which lies between the epithelium and the endothelium. Keratitis means corneal inflammation.
Pathophysiology.
The corneal scarring is the end result of the initial invasion of blood vessels into the corneal stroma as part of the inflammatory response. Since normal corneal tissue should be avascular (no blood vessel) and therefore clear to allow light to pass, the presence of blood vessel and the infiltration of cells as part of the inflammatory process results in scarring or hazing of the cornea.
Aetiology.
By far the most common cause of IK is syphilitic disease. However, there are two possible causes of the corneal inflammatory response: an infection and/or an immunological response, such as a hypersensitivity type reaction, or (rarely) Cogan syndrome. Infectious causes include syphilis (commonest), followed by other bacterial infections (TB, Leprosy and Lyme disease) and parasitic infections (Acanthamoeba, Onchocerciasis or river blindness, Leishmaniasis, Trypanosoma cruzi or "Chagas disease", Trypanosoma brucei or "African sleeping sickness" and microsporidia)
History.
Previous long-standing eye infection which possibly during childhood time recalled as being treated with antibiotic and/or hospitalized over long period of time.
Symptoms and signs.
Acutely or at the early sign includes painful, photophobic, red and watery eye. This is due to active corneal inflammation resulting in vascular invasion and stromal necrosis which can be diffuse or localized. This cause the pinkish discoloration of what was a clear transparent normal corneal tissue (called "Salmon patch of Hutchinson").
Chronically or the end result will cause blurring of vision secondary to corneal stromal scarring, presence of ghost vessel and thinning of the cornea especially if it involves the visual axis.
Treatment.
The underlying cause must be treated as soon as possible to stop the disease process. Corticosteroid drop can be used to minimize the scarring on the cornea along with antibiotic cover. However, residual scarring cannot be avoided which can result in long term visual impairment and corneal transplantation is not suitable due to high rejection rate from the corneal vascularization.

1994–95 Los Angeles Kings season

The 1994–95 Los Angeles Kings season saw the Kings finish fifth in the Pacific Division with a record of 16-23-9, for 41 points. Defense proved to be problematic for the Kings, as they allowed a league-high 1,668 shots (34.8 per game) and finished tied for 23rd overall in goals allowed, with 174. Their offense was more reliable, as the Kings averaged nearly 3 goals scored per game. Despite missing a quarter of the season, Rick Tocchet still led the team in goals with 18.
On May 2, the Dallas Stars were in 7th place in the Western Conference with 42 points while the Kings were tied with the San Jose Sharks for 8th place with 41 points (16-22-9). However, the Kings lost the final game of the season on May 3 to the Chicago Blackhawks by a score of 5-1. Meanwhile, the Sharks came from behind to tie the Vancouver Canucks 3-3 in their final game of the season and, in doing so, jumped up to 7th place while the Stars fell into to 8th place. The Sharks' win combined with the Kings' loss meant that the Kings would finish in 9th place and therefore miss the playoffs.
