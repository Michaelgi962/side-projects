2007 Miami Dolphins season

The 2007 Miami Dolphins season was the 38th season for the team in the National Football League and 42nd season overall. The team nearly went winless for the season, but on December 16, the third to last game of the regular season, they beat the Baltimore Ravens, giving them a final record of 1–15 . The Detroit Lions became the first team to go 0–16 the following season. Their only win of the season gave them the first pick in the 2008 NFL draft. They also failed to improve upon a 6–10 season in 2006. Under former head coach Nick Saban in a year that began with high hopes, Saban resigned from the Dolphins to become the head coach at the University of Alabama, after repeatedly saying he would stay with the Dolphins. The Dolphins entered 2007 in the process of rebuilding under new head coach Cam Cameron, the former offensive coordinator for the San Diego Chargers. The coaching staff underwent significant changes, with approximately twelve coaches newly hired or reassigned. Cameron also made various changes to the team's roster, with a more than a dozen players being added or re-signed and just as many being released, traded or allowed to sign elsewhere. Six of the team's losses in 2007 were by margins of three points or less.
Notable offseason events.
Resignation of Nick Saban.
During the 2006 season, rumors persisted of then-Dolphins head coach Nick Saban leaving for the University of Alabama at season's end. Saban denied these rumors throughout the season, to the point where on December 21 he told the South Florida media "I'm not going to be the Alabama coach." Whether or not he meant it at the time is unknown, but Saban's stance softened after the season, and on January 3, 2007 Saban resigned from the Dolphins to become the new head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide.
Historic game in London.
On February 2, 2007, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced that the Dolphins and New York Giants would play a game at London, England's Wembley Stadium. The game —- the second regular season NFL game to take place outside of the United States and first to take place outside of North America -— counted as a home game for the Dolphins. It took place Sunday, October 28 (Week 8) with kick off at 1:00 pm ET (5:00 pm local London time). It was broadcast on Fox. The Dolphins lost the game to the Giants by a score of 13–10.
In the 72 hours following the announcement, over half a million ticket requests were received. On May 17, 40,000 tickets were made available to people randomly selected from the initial requests. The tickets sold in 90 minutes.
Failed trade of Dan Wilkinson.
On March 2, the Denver Broncos acquired defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson from the Dolphins in exchange for a sixth-round draft choice in the 2007 NFL Draft. A condition of the trade was that Wilkinson report to the Broncos for a physical by Friday, March 16. He did not report for the physical, and although neither team was able to reach Wilkinson by phone the deadline for him to report was extended in hopes of eventually closing the deal.
On March 29, the deal between the Broncos and Dolphins was finally voided. The sixth-round pick reverted to the Broncos, and Wilkinson's rights were once again held by the Dolphins. After failing to attend offseason workouts with the Dolphins in the months that followed, the Dolphins finally terminated Wilkinson's contract on June 18.
Legal troubles.
Joey Porter-Levi Jones altercation.
After five seasons as AFC North rivals, former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Joey Porter and Cincinnati Bengals offensive tackle Levi Jones were involved in an altercation in a Las Vegas casino on March 18.
Arrest and release of Fred Evans.
In the early morning of 2007-06-23, 23-year-old Dolphins defensive tackle Fred Evans was arrested in Miami Beach. According to the police report, Evans was in a dispute with a taxi driver, and refused to leave the cab at the request of the officers called to the scene. Evans reportedly engaged in a physical struggle with the officers when they tried to handcuff him, with one officer being bitten on his left wrist. The officers then used tasers to subdue Evans. He was charged with battery on a police officer, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and trespassing. Complicating matters could be the fact that Evans is already on probation in Colorado County, Texas for possession of marijuana.
In a team-released statement, Dolphins head coach Cam Cameron said: "We are aware that Fred Evans was arrested this morning. We will not condone this type of behavior. I assure everyone it will be dealt with seriously". Cameron made good on his word a few days later, as Evans was waived by the team on June 28.
Arrest and release of Kelly Campbell.
Re-signed by the Dolphins in March after spending 2006 training camp with the team, wide receiver Kelly Campbell had his contract terminated on July 6. It was not until July 24, however, that it was revealed that Campbell's release stemmed from an arrest on drug charges in Atlanta, Georgia on July 3. Campbell was charged with felony possession of marijuana and Ecstasy and a misdemeanor charge of providing false information to police officers. It was Campbell's second arrest in Fulton County. In 2005, Campbell was arrested and charged with marijuana possession and theft by receiving stolen property involving a handgun. He reached a plea deal to avoid a trial.
Arrest of Chris Chambers.
On the morning of Saturday, July 14, Pro Bowl wide receiver Chris Chambers was arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina and charged with driving while impaired and speeding. He was arrested around 2:30 am and later released on $1,750 bond. According to Charlotte-Mecklenburg police Capt. Lisa Goelz, Chambers faced charges of driving while impaired, speeding and reckless driving. On August 15, it was reported that a lawyer for Chambers said he would plead not guilty to driving while impaired. Chambers was charged despite his blood-alcohol content being below the legal limit, although North Carolina law says he can still be convicted.
On September 25, it was reported that Chambers would enter a plea deal in which he would plead guilty to speeding. Under the terms of the plea deal, the charges of driving while impaired and reckless driving were dismissed. He did not have to appear in court.
Offseason personnel moves.
Front office.
On June 26, general manager Randy Mueller signed a contract extension that is expected to keep him with the team through at least 2010. Mueller will also receive a salary adjustment, however financial details were unavailable. After Nick Saban left following the 2006 season, Mueller's role was altered to give him control of personnel.
Coaches.
After the departure of Nick Saban, Dolphins owner H. Wayne Huizenga went on a nationwide search for his next head coach. More than a dozen candidates were interviewed, and on January 19 Cam Cameron agreed to become the seventh head coach in franchise history. Cameron had previously served as offensive coordinator for the San Diego Chargers from 2002 to 2006. He received a four-year contract worth $10 million.
Upon Cameron's arrival, multiple changes were made to the coaching staff. Running backs coach Bobby Williams, wide receivers coach Charlie Baggett, defensive line coach Dan Quinn and strength and conditioning coach Bert Hill were fired. The team extended the contracts of special teams coordinator Keith Armstrong and outside linebackers coach Travis Jones (later reassigned as defensive ends coach). The Dolphins also signed a three-year, $8.1 million contract with defensive coordinator Dom Capers to retain his services. Outside additions to the staff were:
Finally, previous offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey was retained, but was reassigned to the role of tight ends coach. Cameron has stated he will call the offensive plays himself in 2007.

The Dolphins signed one draft pick in June – defensive tackle Paul Soliai, who also received a four-year deal. Offensive lineman Samson Satele signed a for four years on July 18, while quarterback John Beck and center Dew Mormino signed four-year contracts on July 23. At that time, first-round pick Ted Ginn, Jr. was the only unsigned draft pick. However, on the same day that second-round pick Beck was signed, it was reported that the Dolphins and Ginn were close to contract agreement.
Undrafted free agents.
Between May 4–17, the Dolphins signed 16 undrafted free agents following the draft. They were:

Quarterback competition.
During training camp, Cameron held a battle for the starting quarterback job between Trent Green and Cleo Lemon. Green started the team's first two preseason games and completed 45 percent of his passes for 101 yards with one interception. Lemon was the second quarterback to play in each contest and completed 76 percent of his passes for 108 yards. Nevertheless, Cameron announced that Green would be the team's starting quarterback in 2007. The announcement came on August 20 with two preseason games left to be played. Lemon, who had primarily been no higher than third string in his NFL career, is slated to be the backup to Green in 2007.

Cutdown to 75.
With NFL rules mandating team rosters must be cut down to 75 players by August 28, the Dolphins released nine players the day before to reach the limit. Those released were: placekicker Matt Prater, punter Ryan Flinn, wide receiver David Sutton, tight end Jason Rader, cornerback Shirdonya Mitchell, safeties Chris Harrell and Christopher Vedder, running back Ray Perkins and defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson.
The team made two extra roster moves on the cutdown day. Offensive guard/tackle Joe Toledo was moved to the Reserve/Physically Unable to Perform list, meaning he would be eligible to return Week 7 of the regular season. Free agent linebacker/defensive end Jorge Cordova was added to the roster. Cordova had been released by the Jacksonville Jaguars, with which he had spent the previous three seasons.
Cutdown to 53 and subsequent moves.
On September 1, the Dolphins were required to trim the roster to 53 for the regular season. With 22 roster moves needed in all, the Dolphins waived 16 players, waived/injured four and terminated the contracts of two.
The two veterans that had their contracts terminated were fullback Cory Schlesinger and wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim. The four waived/injured players were guard Dan Stevenson, wide receiver P. K. Sam and linebackers Jim Maxwell and Robert McCune. In addition, the 16 players that were waived outright were:
The Dolphins' roster was not finalized immediately after cuts, however. Three players were claimed off waivers by the Dolphins from other teams, requiring an additional three roster moves. On September 2, wide receiver Kerry Reed and center Johnathan Ingram were waived, while rookie center/guard Drew Mormino was played in season-ending Injured Reserve with a shoulder injury. The Dolphins claimed two players off waivers from the San Diego Chargers – wide receiver Greg Camarillo and offensive tackle Cory Lekkerkerker. Meanwhile, offensive lineman Gene Mruczkowski was claimed off waivers from the New England Patriots.
Five days later, defensive end Rob Ninkovich was claimed off waivers from the New Orleans Saints. To make room for him, rookie linebacker Kelvin Smith was waived.
Two Dolphins players changed their jersey numbers following the preseason. Long snapper John Denney, who wore No. 97 the first two years of his career, switched to No. 92. Undrafted rookie linebacker Edmond Miles switched from No. 48 to 50 to comply with NFL rules.
Practice squad.
On September 2 the Dolphins made five additions to their practice squad, all of which among the players cut by the team the day before. Those players were tight end Aaron Halterman, safety Tuff Harris, guard Marquay Love and offensive tackle Julius Wilson and wide receiver Marvin Allen. As the international practice squad player, Allen must remain on the team's practice squad all year and does not count toward the eight-man limit.
Two days later, the Dolphins signed three more players – guard Tala Esera, wide receiver Kerry Reed and wide receiver Chandler Williams – to their practice squad. Esera and Reed were with the Dolphins in preseason and released earlier in the month. Chandler, meanwhile, was a seventh-round pick by the Minnesota Vikings in the 2007 NFL Draft out of Florida International University. He was waived by the team during final cuts on September 1.
Regular season.
Game summaries.
Week 1: at Washington Redskins.
The Dolphins began their 2007 campaign on the road against the Washington Redskins. After a scoreless first quarter, the Redskins made the first move with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 31-yard field goal three minutes into the second quarter. Miami would take the lead before the end of the half with a one-yard touchdown pass from Trent Green to tight end Justin Peelle as time expired.
Washington took a 10–7 lead on a 19-yard Clinton Portis touchdown run with just under 12 minutes remaining in the third quarter. Dolphins kicker Jay Feely tied the game at 10 later in the quarter on a 20-yard field goal, and each team notched another field goal in the fourth quarter. With four seconds remaining and the ball on the Washington 43-yard line, Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell launched a last-second Hail Mary pass that was batted by Dolphins defensive end Jason Taylor in the end zone. Redskins wide receiver Antwaan Randle El caught the ball at the six but was tackled at the three-yard line before he could score the winning touchdown.
The Redskins won the coin toss to begin overtime and promptly mounted a 10-play, 62-yard drive that included just two passes. Suisham made his third field goal of the game, this time from 39 yards out, to win the game 16–13 and hand Miami their first loss of the season as they started out 0–1 and 0–1 against NFC Opponents.
Week 2: vs. Dallas Cowboys.
Attempting to rebound from their overtime road loss to the Redskins in Week 1, the Dolphins hosted the Dallas Cowboys in Week 2. In the first quarter, Miami got the first points of the game when kicker Jay Feely converted a 37-yard field goal. The Cowboys would respond with a 26-yard field goal by Nick Folk. In the second quarter, Dallas took the lead on a 1-yard Marion Barber III touchdown run. Jay Feely made a 45-yard field goal attempt as the half ended with the Cowboys leading 10–6.
In the third quarter, Miami regained the lead with quarterback Trent Green completing an 18-yard TD pass to wide receiver Marty Booker. However, the Cowboys jumped back out in front with quarterback Tony Romo completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Curtis, which was followed by Folk kicking a 28-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Dallas extended the lead with Folk's 47-yard field goal and Romo's 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens. The Dolphins tried to come back as Green completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Derek Hagan, but the Cowboys managed to put the game away with Barber's 40-yard touchdown run as Miami fell to 0–2 and 0–2 against NFC Opponents.
Week 3: at New York Jets.
Trying to snap a two-game skid, the Dolphins flew to The Meadowlands for Week 3 in an AFC East duel against the New York Jets (who were also 0–2 heading into the game). In the first quarter, the Jets flew out first with QB Chad Pennington completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Miami took the lead with RB Ronnie Brown's 1-yard TD run. However, it was short lived as on the ensuing kickoff, RB Leon Washington returned the kick 98 yards for a touchdown. The Dolphins drew closer with kicker Jay Feely's 31-yard and 39-yard field goal. However, New York responded with Pennington completing a 4-yard TD pass to TE Chris Baker.
In the third quarter, the Jets increased their lead with kicker Mike Nugent's 21-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, New York settled with Pennington getting a 2-yard TD run. Miami nearly had a comeback as Brown got a 2-yard TD run, a 2-point conversion run, and a 22-yard TD pass from QB Trent Green. However, the Jets managed to hold on to win the game.
With their third-straight loss, the Dolphins fell to 0–3.
Week 4: vs. Oakland Raiders.
Still searching for their first win of the year, the Dolphins went home for a Week 4 duel with the Oakland Raiders, featuring former teammate Daunte Culpepper. The game was delayed for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms in the area.
In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Culpepper completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter. He even got a 2-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Dolphins managed to get on the board with RB Ronnie Brown getting a 9-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, the 'Fins managed to get closer with kicker Jay Feely getting a 29-yard field goal, yet Oakland answered with Culpepper getting a 5-yard TD run. Miami would end the period with QB Trent Green completing a 3-yard TD pass to TE Justin Peelle. In the fourth quarter however, Culpepper delivered the final blows by hooking up with Porter again on a 27-yard TD pass and getting a 3-yard TD run.
With their fourth-straight loss, the Dolphins fell to 0–4.
Week 5: at Houston Texans.
Still searching for their first win of the year, the Dolphins flew to Reliant Stadium for a Week 5 showdown with the Houston Texans. In the first quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Texans RB Ron Dayne getting a 1-yard TD run. Fortunately, the 'Fins answered with kicker Jay Feely getting a 23-yard field goal. However, with less than 4 minutes to go in the period, history came back to haunt QB Trent Green. During an offensive play, WR Ted Ginn, Jr. was running with the ball and Green went low to block DT Travis Johnson. Trent would end up getting hit in the head with Johnson's knee, knocking him unconscious with a concussion. Johnson would then get flagged for taunting the uncoscious Trent Green. With Green out of the game, back-up Cleo Lemon came in and helped the Dolphins take the lead with RB Ronnie Brown getting a 3-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Miami would increased its lead with Feely getting a 40-yard and a 33-yard field goal. Houston would end the half with kicker Kris Brown getting a 54-yard field goal.
In the third quarter, the Dolphins' lead was erased with Brown giving Houston a 43-yard and a 54-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Miami reclaimed the lead with Feely kicking a 48-yard field goal. However, the Texans would pull out the win with Brown getting not only a 20-yard field goal, but a gut-punching 57-yard field goal.
With their fifth-straight loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0–5, but they also suffered their first 8-straight losing streak since 1967.
Week 6: at Cleveland Browns.
Still looking for their first win of the year, the Dolphins flew to Cleveland Browns Stadium for a Week 6 intraconference duel with the Cleveland Browns. With QB Trent Green still suffering from a concussion from last week, back-up QB Cleo Lemon was given the start.
In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Browns RB Jason Wright got a 1-yard TD run. The 'Fins would respond with kicker Jay Feely getting a 43-yard field goal. However, Cleveland increased its lead with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Browns kicker Phil Dawson getting a 40-yard field goal, along with Anderson completing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. The Dolphins answered with Lemon completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE David Martin, yet Cleveland managed to get a 20-yard field goal from Dawson as time ran out.
In the third quarter, the 'Fins started to retaliate with Lemon getting a 5-yard and a 1-yard TD run. Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Browns would pull away with Anderson and Edwards hooking up with each other on a 5-yard and a 16-yard TD pass. Miami's only response would be Lemon's 4-yard TD pass to Martin.
With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0–6 for the first time since 2004, but they also suffered their 9th-straight loss (the worst losing streak in franchise history).
Along with the St. Louis Rams, it marked the first time since 2000 (Bengals & Chargers) that two teams began a season at 0–6.
Week 7: vs New England Patriots.
Still searching for their first win of the year, the Dolphins returned home for a Week 7 AFC East duel with the undefeated New England Patriots. In the first quarter, Miami's struggles continued as Patriots QB Tom Brady completed a 30-yard TD pass to WR Donté Stallworth and a 2-yard TD pass to TE Kyle Brady. In the second quarter, the Dolphins got their only score of the half with QB Cleo Lemon getting a 4-yard TD run. Afterwards, New England continued its pounding with CB Willie Andrews returning a kickoff 77 yards for a touchdown, along with Brady and WR Randy Moss hooking up with each other on a 35-yard and a 50-yard TD pass. The Patriots would end the half with Brady hooking up with WR Wes Welker on a 14-yard TD pass.
After a scoreless third quarter, Miami tried to make a comeback in the fourth quarter. It began with RB Patrick Cobbs getting a 1-yard TD run, along with DE Jason Taylor returning an interception 36 yards for a touchdown. However, New England made sure that they sealed their victory with Brady hooking up with Welker again on a 16-yard TD pass. Afterwards, the 'Fins ended the game with RB Jesse Chatman getting a 7-yard TD run.
With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0–7 for the first time in franchise history, but they also lost RB Ronnie Brown for the year, as he tore his ACL in the third quarter while trying to stop an interception return.
Week 8: vs. New York Giants.
Still trying to get their first win, the Dolphins flew to Wembley Stadium for their special international interconference game against the New York Giants. For the game, Miami was listed as the home team. In the first quarter, the Dolphins trailed early as Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 20-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Miami's struggles continued with N.Y. QB Eli Manning getting a 10-yard TD run, along with Tynes nailing a 41-yard field goal.

In the fourth quarter, Miami drew close as QB Cleo Lemon completing a 21-yard TD pass to rookie WR Ted Ginn, Jr. However, New York managed to hold on to their lead for the win.
With their 11th-straight loss, the Dolphins entered their bye week at 0–8.
Week 10: vs. Buffalo Bills.
Coming off their bye week and still looking for their first win, the Dolphins went home for an AFC East duel with the Buffalo Bills. In the first quarter, Miami struck first as kicker Jay Feely managed to get a 38-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, the Bills got on the board with DE Chris Kelsay sacking QB Cleo Lemon in the endzone for a safety. Fortunately, the 'Fins responded with Lemon getting a 5-yard TD run. Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, Miami's year-long struggles continued as Buffalo RB Marshawn Lynch got a 3-yard TD run, along with a 2-point conversion run. Later, the Bills sealed the win as kicker Rian Lindell nailed the game-winning 34-yard field goal.
With their ninth-straight loss, the Dolphins fell to 0–9, despite outgaining Buffalo in total offensive yards (269 to 214) and time of possession (36:59 to 23:01).
This marked the 5th time this year that Miami lost by 3 points.
With the Rams' win over the Saints that same week the Dolphins are now the NFL's only winless team.
Week 11: at Philadelphia Eagles.
Still searching for their first win, the Dolphins flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 11 interconference duel with the Philadelphia Eagles. This game would mark the NFL debut of rookie QB John Beck.
After a scoreless first quarter, Miami got the first splash as rookie WR/KR/PR Ted Ginn, Jr. returned a punt 87 yards for a touchdown (the first TD punt return for the Dolphins since 2000). The Eagles would end the half with kicker David Akers nailing a 34-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Miami's year-long struggles continued as Philadelphia took the lead with RB Correll Buckhalter getting an 8-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Eagles sealed the win with QB A.J. Feeley (a former Dolphin) completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Jason Avant.
With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 0–10, eliminating them from playoff contention. This would be the first time since the 2001 Detroit Lions (who began their year at 0–12) that a team began a season 0–10.
Week 12: at Pittsburgh Steelers.
Still trying to get their first win of the year, the Dolphins flew to Heinz Field for a Week 12 Monday Night intraconference duel with the Pittsburgh Steelers. For LB Joey Porter, it would be his first game in Pittsburgh against his former team. This would also mark the NFL return of RB Ricky Williams.
Playing in heavy rain with a delay due to lightning, the game (also known as the Heinz Field Fiasco) remained scoreless through over 59 minutes, becoming the longest scoreless tie since 1943. The game would end with Miami falling yet again as Steelers kicker Jeff Reed got the only points of the game on a fourth-quarter 24-yard field goal with 0:17 left.
With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0–11, but this would also mark the sixth time this season that the Dolphins lost by 3 points or less (a franchise worst).
In his first NFL game since New Year's Day of 2006, reinstated running back Ricky Williams had only six carries for 15 yards. He left the game in the second quarter with a torn pectoral muscle after fumbling and being stepped on by Lawrence Timmons. Williams would later be placed on the injured reserve list, ending his season.
Week 13: vs. New York Jets.
Still trying to get their first win of the year, the Dolphins went home for a Week 13 AFC East rematch with the throwback-clad New York Jets. In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Jets RB Leon Washington got an 18-yard TD run. The Dolphins would end the period with kicker Jay Feely getting a 53-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Miami drew closer as Feely kicked a 44-yard field goal, yet New York replied with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 29-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Dolphins took the lead as CB Michael Lehan returned a fumble 43 yards for a touchdown. However, the Jets regained the lead with QB Kellen Clemens completing a 19-yard TD pass to WR Brad Smith, along with Nugent kicking a 40-yarder and a 35-yard field goal.
In the third quarter, New York increased their lead with Nugent kicking a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Jets sealed the win with RB Thomas Jones getting a 1-yard TD run, Nugent nailing a 26-yard field goal, and Washington getting a 12-yard TD run.
With the loss, Miami fell to 0–12, and have lost 15 straight games dating back to game 14 of last season. This also marked the first time since the 2001 Detroit Lions that a team began a season 0–12.
Week 14: at Buffalo Bills.
Still trying to get their first win, the Dolphins flew to Ralph Wilson Stadium for a Week 14 AFC East rematch with the Buffalo Bills. In the first quarter, Miami's year-long struggles continued as Bills QB Trent Edwards completed a 13-yard and a 28-yard TD pass to TE Robert Royal, while rookie QB John Beck had the ball slip out of his hand and have it caught by Buffalo Safety George Wilson, who would return it 20 yards for a touchdown. The Dolphins would get on the board with RB Samkon Gado getting a 12-yard TD run, yet the Bills answered with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 51-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Buffalo continued its dominance as Edwards completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Lee Evans for the only score of the period.
In the third quarter, the 'Fins tried to rally as Gado got a 20-yard TD run, while kicker Jay Feely got a 41-yard field goal. However, in the fourth quarter, the Bills sealed the win with Edwards and Evans hooking up with each other again on a 70-yard TD pass.
With yet another loss, the Dolphins fell to 0–13.
This would mark their 16th-straight loss, dating back to last season. Also, Miami became the 5th team in NFL history to begin a season at 0–13.
Despite getting the start, Beck only lasted for the first three series, due to a dismal performance (1/2 for 6 yards).
Week 15: vs. Baltimore Ravens.
Still in the hunt for their first win of the year, the Dolphins went home for a Week 15 intraconference duel with the Baltimore Ravens. In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Ravens kicker Matt Stover managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Dolphins continued to trail as Stover kicked a 39-yard field goal. Afterwards, the 'Fins got on the board as kicker Jay Feely managed to get a 23-yard field goal. Baltimore would end the half with QB Kyle Boller completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Derrick Mason.
In the third quarter, Miami began to gain steam as RB Samkon Gado managed to get a 7-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Dolphins took the lead as Feely kicked a 29-yard and an 18-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Ravens tie the game with Stover nailing an 18-yard field goal. In overtime, the demons were lifted as QB Cleo Lemon completed the game-winning 64-yard TD pass to WR Greg Camarillo. Soon after players and coaches rejoiced in the locker room after a long awaited first win.
With the win, not only did Miami improve to 1–13, but it also snapped a 16-game losing streak dating back to last season's December 10 win over the New England Patriots, notching their first win of the 2007 season and avoiding their becoming the first team in NFL history to go 0–16. This would turn out to be their only win in a dismal 1–15 and would keep them from being possibly labeled as the worst team in NFL history. They also avoided having to play with a 0–14 record against a New England Patriots team carrying the complimentary 14–0 record, and widely rooted for to become the first team in over 30 years to match the perfect season feat originally posted by the Dolphins.
For Cleo Lemon, he would get his first career 300-yard game, as he completed 23 out of 39 passes for 315 yards and 1 touchdown.
Week 16: at New England Patriots.
Coming off their home win over the Ravens, the Dolphins flew to Gillette Stadium for a Week 16 AFC East rematch with the undefeated New England Patriots. In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Patriots QB Tom Brady completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, New England pulled away with Brady & Moss hooked up with each other again on a 1-yard TD pass, RB Laurence Maroney getting a 59-yard TD run, and Brady completing a 48-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney. In the third quarter, the Dolphins would get on the board as QB Cleo Lemon completed a 21-yard TD pass to WR Greg Camarillo. However, the Patriots' defense took over for the rest of the game.
With the loss, Miami fell to 1–14.
Week 17: vs. Cincinnati Bengals.
Hoping to finish their horrendous season on a high note, the Dolphins went home for a Week 17 intraconference duel with the Cincinnati Bengals. In the first quarter, Miami struck first as kicker Jay Feeley managed to get a 49-yard field goal. The Bengals would take the lead as QB Carson Palmer completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Chad Johnson. In the second quarter, the 'Fins regained the lead as QB Cleo Lemon completed a 5-yard TD to rookie WR Ted Ginn, Jr., yet Cincinnati retook the lead with Palmer completing a 70-yard TD pass to Chad Johnson and a 4-yard TD pass to WR Antonio Chatman.
In the third quarter, the Bengals increased their lead with Safety Chinedum Ndukwe returning a fumble 54 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, the Dolphins tried to come back as rookie QB John Beck got a 2-yard TD run, but Cincinnati pulled away as RB Kenny Watson got a 2-yard TD run and kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 30-yard field goal. Miami ended the game with Beck completing a 22-yard TD pass to WR Derek Hagan.
With the loss, the Dolphins ended their season at 1–15 and became the first 1–15 team since the 2001 Panthers.
Transactions.
September.
During the Dolphins' Week 1 loss to the Redskins, starting strong safety Yeremiah Bell suffered a torn Achilles' tendon. As a result, he was placed on season-ending Injured Reserve on September 11. The team also waived backup defensive end Akbar Gbaja-Biamila, who did not play in the season opener. With two open spots on the 53-man roster, the team signed contracts with veteran safeties and Donovin Darius and Lamont Thompson. They were waived by the Oakland Raiders and Tennessee Titans, respectively, at the end of the preseason. The same day, rookie linebacker Kelvin Smith, who was waived four days earlier, was re-signed to the team's practice squad.
October.
On the first day of the month, linebacker Robert McCune was waived from injured reserve. Linebacker Jim Maxwell suffered the same fate eight days later.
The Dolphins' active roster remained unchanged for nearly a month after the season opener. The first transactions since came on October 10, when defensive tackle Sam Rayburn was signed and safety Lamont Thompson was released. Thompson appeared in one game for the Dolphins after being signed on September 11 and made one tackle. Rayburn went to training camp with the San Francisco 49ers in 2007 after spending the first four years of his career with the Philadelphia Eagles.
On October 16, Miami traded their No. 1 receiver, seven-year veteran Chris Chambers, to the San Diego Chargers in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. In 100 games with the Dolphins since being drafted in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft, Chambers caught 405 passes for 5,688 yards and 43 touchdowns. He earned his first Pro Bowl selection in 2005. In the team's first six games of the 2007 season, he caught 31 passes for 415 yards with no touchdowns. On the same day, the team also released safety Donovin Darius and placed defensive tackle Chase Page on injured reserve.
To fill the three roster spots vacated by Chambers, Darius and Page, the Dolphins signed three defensive linemen – tackles Anthony Bryant and Jesse Mahelona and end Derreck Robinson. Bryant was on the practice squad of the Baltimore Ravens prior to his signing. Mahelona and Robinson had been released by the Tennessee Titans and San Diego Chargers, respectively, in September.
After suffering a concussion in the team's Week 5 game against the Houston Texans, starting quarterback Trent Green was placed on injured reserve on October 20. Wide receiver Kerry Reed – an undrafted free agent from Michigan State – was promoted to the active roster from the practice squad.
Three days later, defensive tackle Jesse Mahelona was waived after being inactive for one game with the team. Starting running back Ronnie Brown and starting free safety Renaldo Hill were both placed on injured reserve with torn ACLs suffered in the team's Week 7 game against the New England Patriots. Brown was leading the NFL in offensive yards at the time of the injury.
On October 24, two of the three roster spots were filled from outside the organization as the Dolphins signed defensive end Quentin Moses and safety Lance Schulters. Moses was originally drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the third round of the 2007 NFL Draft and was claimed off waivers by the Arizona Cardinals on September 2. He was inactive for six games before being waived. Schulters spent the latter part of the 2006 season with the Atlanta Falcons after starting for the Dolphins in 2005. Tight end Aaron Halterman was also promoted from the practice squad.
Additionally, running back Samkon Gado was claimed off waivers from the Houston Texans. The team was granted a one-game roster exemption, as Gado was unable to meet the Dolphins in time for their October 28 game in London. On October 30, defensive tackle Sam Rayburn was waived to make room for Gado on the active roster.
The Dolphins also filled two practice squad spots vacated by Reed and Halterman with quarterback Casey Bramlet and tight end Buck Ortega. A seventh-round pick by the Cincinnati Bengals in 2004, Bramlet spent 2007 training camp with the Atlanta Falcons. Ortega had been waived by the Cleveland Browns in late August.
November.
On November 6, the Dolphins placed linebacker Abraham Wright – one of the team's seventh-round picks in 2007 – on injured reserve with a knee injury. He had inactive for all eight of the team's games in 2007. Practice squad tight end Buck Ortega was released the same day. The following day, defensive back Jereme Perry was signed to the active roster an undrafted free agent wide receiver Stefan Logan (South Dakota) was signed to the practice squad. Perry had spent the 2006 season and 2007 training camp with the Cleveland Browns.
On November 14, safety Travares Tillman was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury. Tuff Harris – an undrafted defensive back from Montana – was promoted from the practice squad to the active roster. Placekicker Matt Prater, who spent training camp with the Dolphins, was re-signed to the practice squad. Prater briefly held the kicking job for the Atlanta Falcons, but was waived on September 19 after going 1-for-4 on field goal in two games.
On November 19, running back Ricky Williams was reinstated by the NFL. Williams had been suspended since the 2006 offseason for his fourth violation of the league substance abuse policy. The team was granted a one-week roster exemption for Williams.
Williams' return to the Dolphins did not last long, however. After being activated by the Dolphins when running back Samkon Gado was waived on November 26, Williams suffered a torn pectoral muscle against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was placed on injured reserve on November 28 and Gado was re-signed.
Despite returning to practice on November 6, offensive lineman Joe Toledo – on the physically-unable-to-perform list since training camp – was unable to return to the active roster for the 2007 season. His practice period expired on November 27, forcing him to remain on the PUP list for the remainder of the season.
December.
On December 4, starting middle linebacker Zach Thomas was placed on injured reserve with lingering effects of a concussion suffered earlier in the season. Safety Cameron Worrell became the third starting strong safety to be placed on injured reserve after suffering a torn ACL in the team's Week 13 game against the New York Jets. Wide receiver Kerry Reed was also waived by the team after spending six games on the active roster.
To fill two of the roster spots, linebacker Kelvin Smith and offensive tackle Julius Wilson were promoted to the active roster from the practice squad. Both rookies, Smith had originally been drafted in the seventh round out of Syracuse in 2007 while Wilson was signed as an undrafted free agent out of UAB. Filling the third spot was rookie linebacker Mark Washington, who was signed off the practice squad of the San Francisco 49ers.
Wide receiver Kerry Reed was re-signed to the practice squad after being waived by the team, and linebacker Marcello Church was signed to the practice squad as well. Church went undrafted out of Florida State in 2006 and had spent part of the 2007 offseason with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Awards and honors.
Dolphins players received two weekly honors during the 2007 season. Wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. won Diet Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week honors for his performance against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 11, during which he returned a punt 87 yard for a touchdown (the first of his career) and also caught four passes for 52 yards.
In Week 15, quarterback Cleo Lemon won AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for leading the Dolphins to their first victory of the season against the Baltimore Ravens. In the game, Lemon went 23-for-39 for 315 yards and threw a game-winning 64-yard touchdown pass to Greg Camarillo in overtime.
On December 18, it was announced that defensive end Jason Taylor was selected to the 2008 Pro Bowl – his fourth straight selection and sixth overall. Taylor finished the 2007 season with 56 tackles (47 solo), 11 sacks, four passes defensed and an interception returned for a touchdown.

Heinrich Frenkel

Heinrich Sebastian Frenkel (June 5, 1860 Heiden, Switzerland – April 21, 1931 Dresden-Loschwitz) was a Swiss physician and neurologist born in Heiden, a town overlooking Lake Constance. He was an early practitioner of neuro-rehabilitation, advocating a regimen of special exercises for patients with neurological disorders.
Biography.
He studied medicine at the Universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig, and was a student of neurologist Wilhelm Heinrich Erb (1840-1921). In 1884 he earned his degree at Leipzig, afterwards returning to Heiden to practice medicine.
At Heiden he rented a house in "Cure Park" filled with special exercise equipment. Here he established a center of physical medicine and rehabilitation in order to reinstate dexterity and to improve mobility for patients with neurological impairments.
Frenkel achieved great success with therapeutic exercises for cerebellar ataxia and ataxia.
This success eventually attracted patients from all parts of Europe, and even America: see Frenkel Exercises.
He was visited in Heiden by Rubens Hirschberg (1862–1920), who was an assistant to French neurologist Fulgence Raymond (1844–1910). Hirschberg was deeply impressed with Frenkel's work with neurological disorders, and on his return to Paris, convinced Raymond to establish a gymnasium in the neurology department at the Salpétriére. In addition, renowned neurosurgeon Otfrid Foerster (1873-1941) was greatly influenced by Frenkel's work and spent considerable time at Heiden.
In 1896 Frenkel relocated to Berlin, where in 1913 he attained the title of professor. Here he served as head of the serological department at the clinic of psychiatry and neurology at Charité Hospital. He was the author of "Die Therapie ataktischer Bewegungsstörungen", a treatise on treatment of tabetic ataxia by means of systematic exercise and movement therapy.
His name is associated with "Frenkel's symptom", which is defined as lowered muscular tonus in tabetic neurosyphilis.
Frenkel died in Dresden, Germany and his body was brought to Heiden, Switzerland for burial.

Homer Spit

The Homer Spit is a geographical landmark located in Homer, Alaska on the southern tip of the Kenai Peninsula. The spit is a long piece of land jutting out into Kachemak Bay. The spit is also home to the Homer Boat Harbor. The harbor contains both deep and shallow water docks and serves up to 1500 commercial and pleasure boats at its summer peak. Additional features and attractions include "The Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon", which is an artificial "fishing hole", campgrounds, hotels, and restaurants and the Salty Dawg Saloon, which is constructed out of several historic buildings from Homer. Hundreds of eagles have gathered there in winter to be fed by Jean Keene, the "Eagle Lady". The Spit features the longest road into ocean waters in the entire world, taking up 10–15 minutes to cover by car.
History.
Two different theories postulate that the spit originates either from the tidal swells and currents of Cook Inlet and Kachemak Bay over millennia of sand buildup, or that it was pushed into place by now-retreated glaciers. In 1899, the Cook Inlet Coal Fields Company laid a railroad track along the spit, connecting the docks to the coal fields along Kachemak Bay. The resulting business led to the development of what eventually became Homer, Alaska. In the 1960s, several hippies, known as "spit rats", traveled from all around to camp on the Homer Spit, many of them becoming successful commercial fishermen over time. The 1964 Alaska earthquake shrank it to , and killed most of the vegetation, making it today mostly gravel and sand.
Nick Dudiak Fishing Lagoon.
This artificial lagoon is known locally as the "fishing hole". Every spring it stocked with salmon fry from the Trail Lakes hatchery facility. The fry are fed by volunteers so that they will imprint on the location in the normal manner of salmon. They then proceed to live normal lives as wild salmon, returning as adults to the lagoon due to their instinctual desire to mate and spawn. The lagoon is a popular attraction for both tourists and locals, as it is an easily accessible and inexpensive salmon fishery. There is even a ramp for those who have to use wheelchairs. During the summer months it can become very crowded if there is an active salmon run occurring, and there is additional competition from harbor seals who often enter the lagoon to chase salmon. The official name is a tribute to the biologist from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game who proposed the idea and managed the project.
Potential threats.
The spit sits about above sea level, making it susceptible to storm surge. The United States Army Corps of Engineers have stated that a violent enough storm could generate waves of over . Tsunamis are also a known threat. An explosion from the nearby Augustine Volcano could bring a giant wave to the Spit within minutes, giving residents very little time to react. However, most tsunamis from other areas in the ocean would probably give Spit-dwellers enough time to get to safety, due to the early warning system operated by the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (WC/ATWC) in Palmer, Alaska. Erosion of the Spit has also been a developing problem over the years, as the ocean side is exposed to heavy waves.

Prestwich Arts College

Prestwich Arts College is a comprehensive school in Prestwich, Bury, England. The current head teacher is Chris Hornby. He has been the head teacher since Easter 2013. Geoff Barlow retired after many years at the school at Easter 2013, passing over to Mr. Hornby
History.
The school opened as Heys Road School for Boys in 1936 and was used for treating wounded soldiers during the Second World War.The new block was opened in 1981, and includes an extensive Sports Hall, Science rooms and Art and Woodwork rooms. In 2002, a new humanities block was opened. The school later became Prestwich Community High School and, upon receiving specialist arts status in 2004, Prestwich Arts College. And in 2010 it became Prestwich Arts and Media College.
Throughout 2006, along with several other schools in the wider Bury borough, it had been under a sustained threat of closure. It is believed that there will be 2,000 fewer high school students in Bury by 2015, so Bury Council wanted to close two high schools in the area. On 18 July 2007, the threat of closure was thrown out by the School's Organisation Committee.
Since then the number of students at the school has grown, and in 2010 it received a major refurbishment, including a recently completed new dining hall and a major auditorium to support its Performing Arts status.
Ofsted describes the school in its November 2009 Inspection Report as:
Prestwich Arts College is a smaller than average school that is growing in popularity. It attracts students from both the local area as well as from the inner city areas of Manchester and Salford. There are more boys than girls. Around 38% of students are from a wide range of minority ethnic backgrounds, the largest group being of Pakistani origin. Around a quarter of students speak English as an additional language. The proportion of students who take free school meals is twice the national average. The number of students with special educational needs and/or disabilities is slightly higher than average. A relatively high number of students join the school at other times than the start of Year 7. The school has secured a number of awards including Investors in People, the Financial Management Standard, Artsmark Gold and Healthy Schools. It has been a specialist arts college since 2004.
Uniform.
The uniform is a powder blue shirt with a clip on tie, consisting of school colours. A black blazer is worn which shows the school's badge and since 2012, a house braid. Plain black trousers or skirts are worn with this.

Oyster Bay (LIRR station)

Oyster Bay is the terminus on the Oyster Bay Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. The station is located off Shore Avenue between Maxwell and Larabee Avenues. It is a sheltered concrete elevated platform that stands in the shadows of the original station, which was accessible from the ends of Maxwell, Audrey, and Hamilton Avenues. Both stations exist along the south side of Roosevelt Park.
The original Oyster Bay station was built on June 25, 1889 and remodeled in 1902. At one point there were plans to extend the line east towards the Port Jefferson Branch. There was also a large pier built to facilitate the loading of passenger cars onto a short-lived ferry to Wilson's Point in South Norwalk, Connecticut that is now owned by the Flowers Oyster Company. The former Oyster Bay Station and the Oyster Bay Long Island Rail Road Turntable were both listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places on July 6, 2005. Efforts are under way to transform the former station into a railroad museum.
No bus access is available for the station, however local taxicabs do stop.
Platform and track configuration.
This station has one high-level side platform, that is six cars long, located south of the tracks. The Oyster Bay Branch has two tracks at this location. The north track, not adjacent to the platform, is a passing siding leading to a seven-track yard just beyond the station. The old station building lies just east of the new station.
History.
In 1889, the Oyster Bay Extension Railroad, a subsidiary of the Long Island Railroad, extended the terminus of its rail line from Locust Valley to Oyster Bay and constructed this beautiful Victorian train station on land donated by Col. Robert Townsend. The original station had a large wooden platform and an elegant porte cochere, a covered porch large enough for horse-drawn carriages to pass through.
In 1891, the Long Island Rail Road connected the land to the sea via a wharf that enabled rail cars full of passengers to be loaded onto a ferry. This ferry, called the Cape Charles would take passengers to Connecticut where the railways would be connected to the Housatonic Railroad and continue on to Boston. This unique service from New York to Boston ceased operations when a land route across Connecticut was built.
Also on September 9. 1891, Locomotive No. 113 exploded while idling in the station awaiting passengers. People as far away as East Norwich felt the force of the blast; three crewmen were killed.
When Theodore Roosevelt became President of the New York City Police Board in 1895, he commuted regularly through this station, and when he became President of the United States in 1901, a huge expansion of the station was planned to accommodate the expected rise in visitors to the hamlet. Those 1902 renovations included the removal of the porte cochere and the addition of weather sheds. Inside the station, a large fireplace and tiled hearth were added, and on the exterior a special stucco was used that contained real oyster shells.
At the end of the 20th century, the station fell into a state of disrepair. To accommodate double-decker trains, a new station and platform were built nearby.
The Oyster Bay Railroad Museum has begun work to transform the station into the new home of the Oyster Bay Railroad Museum.
The Oyster Bay Railroad Museum, a NYS Historical/educational Not for Profit Museum is working on the Museum under the Town of Oyster Bay. The original LIRR Oyster Bay railroad station is now owned by the Town of Oyster Bay, rather than the LIRR and currently is not accessible to the public while undergoing various engineering and architectural studies and reviews in order to start the restoration into a museum.
The Oyster Bay Railroad Museum Preview Center is now open at 102 Audrey Ave. a few hundred feet from the station building near Oyster Bay Town Hall. (516-558-7036)

History.
Origins (2002-2008).
Capital Lights was formed in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2002 as a hardcore band called Aftereight. Under this name, the band released two EPs and a full-length album, "Better Late Than Never" (2007), and toured frequently. Following the release of the album, vocalist Jacob Dement and guitarist Justin Lamproe both left the band, resulting in bassist Bryson Phillips taking Dement's place and the band as a whole switching to a pop rock sound. After releasing their second EP, "Revival of the Fittest", which displayed the new style, the band was signed to Tooth & Nail Records.
"This Is An Outrage! "(2008-2009).
In 2008, while recording their debut studio album for Tooth & Nail, Aftereight officially changed its name to Capital Lights as a way of signifying their new musical direction. The band then toured in the months following as the opening act to the "Green T Tour", headlined by fellow Tooth and Nail act Hawk Nelson and second act Run Kid Run.
Their debut Tooth and Nail release, "This Is an Outrage!", was released on July 8, 2008.
Breakup.
On the August 19, 2009 Capital Lights announced on their MySpace page that they had broken up claiming that "We all felt God had different plans for our lives, and it would have been impossible to pursue those plans while continuing with the band."
Reunion.
On Christmas Eve of 2010, lead singer Bryson Phillips appeared on RadioU's morning show The R!OT for an interview during their Christmas Eve show. He announced on the behalf of the band that they had agreed with Tooth & Nail CEO Brandon Ebel to record a second album for the label.

Flex space

Flex space is a term used for lightly zoned buildings. It is mainly used when referring to industrial or office space.
History.
Flex space evolved from light industrial warehouses being converted to office space. Businesses that generally occupy these are new dotcoms, mechanic shops, and companies that contract plumbing, pest, electrical, and sometimes churches and related services.
Companies have discovered that on any given work day, a large percentage of their cubes are unoccupied--in some cases, up to 50%. Employees travel for work, take vacation, or are working from home in greater numbers than ever before. To avoid having to lease or buy more office space, flex space allows a company to have a higher occupancy of cube space and less wasted work areas.
At the beginning of the work day, an employee shows up at work. Cubes are mostly configured in the same way, making them all the same. The employee chooses a cube where he would like to sit, and that is his cube for the day. At the end of the day, he packs up his belongings, either bringing them all home with him or storing them in a locker space. This leaves the cube the same way it was when he came in, and leaves it free and open for someone to use the following day.
A large concern with employees in a flex space environment is cleanliness. It is important in a flex space environment to have a strong cleaning staff.

Patsy Stone

Eurydice Colette Clytemnestra Dido Bathsheba Rabelais Patricia Cocteau Stone, more commonly known as Patsy Stone, is a fictional character on the UK television series "Absolutely Fabulous", portrayed by actress Joanna Lumley.
Background.
Patsy was the last of a string of children born to an aging bohemian mother in Paris. She and Edina Monsoon were childhood friends, and since her mother despised and neglected her—regarding her more as a rival than a daughter—she came to rely on the Monsoons for most of her shelter, comfort, and food (though she has only been seen eating twice since 1973). She mentioned that her mother would have had an abortion, though she mistook her pregnancy for the onset of the menopause. The first few years of her life were spent locked in a room, and the rest of her childhood was dismal by Patsy's own description, without friends, parties, or presents. She claims to have blocked out everything before 1968, though occasionally memories come back to her in the form of flashbacks. She is an outrageous, narcissistic, nymphomaniacal, past-her-prime fashion model and "ex-Bond girl" (although her only "actual" Bond films were "Bond Meets Black Emmanuelle", "Boldfinger", and "The Man with Thunder Balls" – Joanna Lumley was a genuine Bond Girl in "On Her Majesty's Secret Service") who drinks and smokes heavily. She shares a codependent parasitic existence with Edina. This relationship usually results in hilarious, albeit dysfunctional, behaviour and over-the-top conflicts. Patsy was born on 30 October, although her actual age is never clearly divulged; she often states herself to be between 39 and 43. In one episode ("Cold Turkey") a nurse guesses that she is around 65 years old. Patsy also has a sister named Jackie, whom Eddy abhors and who twice tried to kill Patsy with drug overdoses. Jackie intimidates Patsy into stating that Patsy is the elder of the two, and says, in the same episode, that she is 72, to which Patsy replies "My God, then how old does that make me?", suggesting that Patsy has lied about her age so often that she can no longer remember her real age.
Patsy usually seems quite cold and unemotive, especially in her behaviour toward her chief rival Saffy, but she sometimes reveals a more vulnerable side (in flashbacks to her bleak life with her mother, in her overeager admiration for the awful Jackie, and in those rare moments when Eddy temporarily withdraws her friendship) and even occasionally asks Saffy for advice. Unlike Eddy, she is usually conservatively, but stylishly, dressed and almost invariably wears her hair in a characteristic blonde beehive. She has a well-paying, do-nothing job as a fashion director for a fashion magazine, which she received after having sex with the publisher. She then went on to work at "Jeremy's", an exclusive high street fashion store with celebrity clients such as Minnie Driver. It is hinted that Patsy has been involved in some questionable activities, such as adult films; she uses her knowledge from that time to blackmail Saffron's prospective mother-in-law. At a party to launch a new Beatles track in the episode "Schmoozin", Patsy's appearance in the low-budget soft porn movie "Booberella" is shown to the guests, much to her embarrassment. When faced with a situation that someone else might find alarming or disconcerting, Patsy often responds with a cool "right, cheers, thanks a lot." During the 1970s in Morocco, Patsy underwent a sex change operation and briefly lived as a man; but, as Eddy says, "it fell off". In a later episode, she becomes one of the few tourists to smuggle marijuana into Morocco. She is very promiscuous up until "The Last Shout", then begins to lose her power over men. In two episodes ("Door Handle" and "The Last Shout") it is revealed that Patsy lives in the storeroom above Oddbins, a chain of UK liquor stores. She says that she has not eaten anything since 1973, having had a "stomach bypass" according to Eddy. She is shown in a flashback in the episode "Magazine" to be eating a plate of food.

Monastery of Dumio

The Monastery of Dumio (sometimes Dumium or Dumio, in Portuguese "São Martinho de Dume"), is a former paleo-Christian monastery in the civil parish of Dume, municipality of Braga, in northwestern Portugal. Originally a Roman villa, it was the base of a basilica by Suebi tribes, and later Christian monastery headed by Martin of Braga in the 6th century (c. 550–560). The re-discovery of the Roman ruins in the late 20th century resulted in archaeological excavations that unearthen its former use.
History.
By the 1st century, there already existed an octagonal Roman villa, which, much later (3rd century) included a system of baths.
In the first half of the 6th century, construction of a primitive church was ordered constructed by the Suebi King Chararic (Suebian king), to honour God for curing his son. It can also be inferred that this was a reflection of the expansion and authority of the Suebi within the northern context of Braga. By the middle of the 6th century, the site began to take on an important context within the peninsula. Under Martin of Braga, referred to as the "Apostle of the Suebi", the older structures were taken over by a monastery, whose religious importance began to make it the centre of religion in the kingdom, and an autonomous diocese in close proximity to Braga. The King himself constructed a palace annex, making the ancient village a centre of decision-making in the Cortes. The design was also a combination of Suebi aesthetics and 6th century influences from southern Gaul; there existed semi-formal links to the Merovingian monarchs with whom the Suebi corresponded, showing artistic influences in the sarcophagus and layout of the basilica.
Three centuries after the construction of São Martinho, and during the Reconquista the basilica was the object of fundamental reforms. The church was transferred to the benevolance of the Bishop of Mondonhedo, São Rosendo (later confirmed in 911).
Then, there was a return during the 10th century, with the re-purposing and re-population initiatives of Afonso III. Yet, by this time, the religious complex in Dume was abandoned (or at least in weak decline): neither the memory of Martin of Braga nor its ancient glory would motivate any new importance. It is likely that it may have served as a parochial church, but the ruins discovered on the site clearly indicate that it may not have lasted in this function for long. Dume was returned to the Diocese of Braga around 1103, where it remained, although later indictions as to the condition, state or use of the ancient basilica are none existent.
In 1608, there were references to the hermitage of Nossa Senhora do Rosário, around the houses of the municipal seat. It was also around this time that the actual Matriz Church was completed (17th century). Later expansion of the church was completed in the first half of the 18th century.
Around 1747, the "Contador de Argote" relates the appearance of diverse archaeological vestiges in Dume, casual objects unearthed by local farmers.
But it was only in 1987 that a formal identification of a Roman "villa" under the Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Rosário was completed; Luís O. Fontes, a professor at the department of archeology at the University of Minho detailed his findings in the civil parish. In 1992, formal excavations of the medieval funerary site was begun in Dume. By May 1993, the Roman baths of the Roman villa were discovered. The remains of Martin of Braga were moved to a subterranean tomb alongside the ruins, underneath the chapel. In 1997, the local government () erected a fence to protect the backyard of the "Casa do Assento", whose archaeological structure corresponded to the Roman bathhouse was discovered. The beginning of the exploration of the uncovered paleo-Christian basilica were begun in July 2005. The collection of archaeological artefacts collected during the excavations were depoisted with the Museu Dom Diogo de Sousa, in Braga. This included primarily ceramics from the Roman and medieval periods, but also Roman era glass and amphora, corroded medieval coins and decorative Roman mosaics. Also discovered: part of a lid of a sarcophagus, the base of columns, arches, fragments of stems, bows and staves, decorated with a herringbone rosettes and, slabs of limestone and marble that include traces of title and lattice grid.
Architecture.
The ruins are located around the "Lugar da Igreja" or "Lugar do Assento" on the square occupied by the parochial church of Dume. Occupying a rural landscape, the space is an ample property that include the Church of São Martinho de Dume, constituted by a central nucleus of the courtyard, the chapel of Nossa Senhora do Rosário and backyard of the "Casa do Assento", on the same block occupied by the local cemetery.
The archaeological ruins in Dume encompass a complex of structures that include: a grande Roman villa (with a habitational zone) and bathhouse; remnants of a granite basilica in the form of a Latin cross (oriented east to west); with regularly horizontal aligned deposits in mortar, pavement and polychromatic mosaics; and a necropolis consisting of twelve graves, located in an area defined by granite slabs and/or brick coverage. These individual spaces were occupied successively over a 2000 year period.

Pedro Molina Mazariegos

Doctor Pedro José Antonio Molina Mazariegos (April 29, 1777, Guatemala—1854) was a Central American politician, considered one of the founders of liberalism in Guatemala.
At the head of a party named "Los Cacos" (The Thieves), he fought for the independence of Central America from Spain. Los Cacos were opposed by "Los Serviles" (The Slaves).
In 1802 he was a professor at the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. In 1820 he formulated a plan for the reform of medical education. His plan was accepted and put into practice.
He was a physician and a journalist. He founded "El Editor Constitucional" (later known as "El Genio de la Libertad") on July 24, 1820. On March 10, 1848 he founded "El Album Republicano". Because of his vocal opposition to the government, he was held for a time incommunicado in the Castle of San José.
From July 10, 1823 to October 4, 1823 he served on the first executive triumvirate of the newly independent Federal Republic of Central America, and was the triumvirate's first president. Later, he was president of the states of Guatemala (August 23, 1829 to February 10, 1831) and Los Altos (December 28, 1838 to January 27, 1840) within the federation.

Awakening (song)

"Awakening" is the second single from Switchfoot's sixth studio album, "Oh! Gravity.". The single was released to radio in March 2007. It hit Hot AC radio stations with an impact day of March 26, 2007 and eventually peaked at No. 54 on that format's charts. It was also slated for release to Top 40, Alternative, and Active Rock stations, [http://footsoldiers.bandfarm.com/fs_radiopromo.htm] but saw virtually no play on any of those formats.
Song history.
The song was written during some time off between tours supporting the band's fifth record, Nothing Is Sound. "We had two or three weeks off tour in January of this last year," bassist Tim Foreman said. "We were touring in support of 'Nothing is Sound' and we had some time to go into the studio. "We didn't really have a plan," noted Switchfoot singer/songwriter Jon Foreman about that time in the studio. This lack of deadline pressure allowed the band to write music freely, and out of those sessions came "Awakening."
It was the first official track recorded when it came time to begin actual recording for Oh! Gravity. and was produced by Steve Lillywhite, whose credits include U2 and Dave Matthews Band. "We just love his big-picture input on the song 'Awakening.'” said Tim.
About the song itself, songwriter Jon Foreman said, "Perhaps to be truly reborn death is not optional. Here’s a firsthand story about new life, it always starts at the bottom."
Music video.
Release and making of.
A music video for this song was filmed February 28, 2007 in Toronto, one of the stops on the band's Winter/Spring Tour. Brandon Dickerson (director of "You Already Take Me There" and "New Way to Be Human" videos) directed the Awakening music video. It was released leaked, April 5 by the band's web content designer, Dale Manning on YouTube.
The official release date for the music video was Tuesday, April 10. It premiered on the band's official YouTube account and on the website. The video is different from the band's previous videos because the video is not overtly related to the song or the meaning of the song. It is also different in the fact that the band funded the video out of their own pockets, without support from their record label.
The creation of the video also was unique in the fact that Dickerson used a never-before-used technique dubbed "paper-mation." Instead of using clay in the more common technique of "claymation," the band employed paper print-outs of their performances, and were able to achieve the effect of animation.
Video plot.
The "Awakening" music video mainly focuses on two men (Tony Hale and Adam Campbell), who first step out of an elevator and play a cardboard version of Guitar Hero in their apartments. As they play, they lip-synch the words to the song. Later on in the video, a woman (Jayma Mays) is seen playing Dance Dance Revolution along with the other two gamers. The only clips of the band playing the song in live action are shown early in the video as the guitars kick in. The band are later shown throughout the rest of the video as animated characters in a cardboard television. (Jon Foreman is seen playing Guitar Hero near the end of the video).
Promotion.
Switchfoot's major label Columbia/SonyBMG put out very little support for the single. The video was completely funded by the band, with no help from the label, and by all accounts, the radio single was not promoted to radio stations at all. Whether this incident was the cause or not, Switchfoot and Sony parted ways shortly after the release of this single.
In response to the lack of label-side support, the band's fans took it upon themselves to help promote the video in more of a grassroots marketing way. The website We're Awakening was originally created with the intent of promoting the song.
Awards.
In 2008, the song was nominated for two Dove Awards: Rock/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year and Long Form Music Video of the Year at the 39th GMA Dove Awards.

<doc id="9885255" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9885255" title="9×57mm Mauser">
9×57mm Mauser

The 9×57mm Mauser is a cartridge based on the 7.92×57mm Mauser. It uses the identical 57 mm-long cartridge case, with the same shoulder angle, but necked up to accept a 9 mm-diameter bullet. Ballistically - but not dimensionally - it is indistinguishable from the 9×56mm Mannlicher-Schoenauer. It is currently regarded as a semi-obsolete calibre, although hand-loading keeps it alive.
Performance.
Firing a relatively heavy bullet of approximately 14-16 g (220-250 grains) at a modest velocity of about 670–700 m/s (2,200-2,300 ft/s), the 9×57mm is low in noise and recoil, pleasant to shoot, and regarded as accurate and effective on all but the very largest, most dangerous game at distances out to 250–300 m (300-350 yd).
The cartridge's low velocity combined with the heavy, poorly streamlined bullet gave the 9×57 a rather poor trajectory, which made it unsuited to lazy shooting at longer ranges. This calibre was popular as a large-deer cartridge in Germany and Central Europe; and also in German spheres of influence in Africa in the early 20th century, such as German West Africa and German East Africa, where it was widely popular among European farmers and settlers for shooting plains game. It also accounted for many lions and leopards. Its popularity was gradually eclipsed by the significantly more powerful, rather flatter-shooting 9.3 x 62 Mauser cartridge. The CIP Maximum Average Pressure (MAP) for the 9×57 is 280 MPa bar (40,600 PSI).
Firearms using the 9×57.
Many beautifully made sporting rifles in 9×57mm caliber, often dating from well before 1939, are still giving their owners good service today, but dependable, recently made factory ammunition is increasingly expensive and hard to obtain, and many users must rely on handloading.
Many of these Mauser rifles were made from de-militarized WWI small ring M98 rifles by many gunsmiths throughout Germany, and usually these are rebored (oversized from 7.92×57mm). When barrels eventually wear out, 9×57mm rifles are generally rebarrelled in other, more modern calibres.
The cartridge was popular around the world and was even chambered in Remington Model 30 and Winchester Model 54 rifles.
Commercial production.
The Eley-Kynoch 9×57 cartridge manufactured by the company at its Birmingham, England factory up to the 1950s used fully jacketed and soft-nosed, round-nosed, flat-based bullets weighing , with an average muzzle velocity of . Factory-loaded ammunition is now increasingly hard to come by, and most users handload, using either fire-formed 9×57 brass or modified 7×57 or 8×57 cases necked up to accept 9 mm diameter bullets.
9.3×57mm.
The 9.3×57mm (bullet diameter .365 in.), introduced in 1900, is closely related to the 9×57mm Mauser, even though some dimensions of the cartridge case are slightly different. The 9.3×57mm is still fairly popular among moose hunters in Scandinavia (among hunters in Sweden it is affectionately known as "potatiskastaren", the spud gun, because of the slow and heavy bullet). Factory loaded ammunition with and bullets is available from Norma of Sweden. The 9.3×57mm Norma factory load with a bullet has a muzzle velocity of for of energy, which makes it 10-20% more powerful than the 9×57mm.

Crazy Love (Van Morrison song)

"Crazy Love" is a romantic ballad written by Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison and included on his 1970 album, "Moondance". The song was released as a single in May 1970 with "Come Running" as the A-side, and again in the Netherlands with "Come Running" as the B-side. The cover of the single shows Morrison with his then-wife, Janet "Planet" Rigsbee. The photograph was taken by Elliot Landy, the official photographer of the 1969 Woodstock festival.
Duets with Van Morrison.
Ray Charles introduced Van Morrison by starting the first verse before Van's appearance when he was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 2003. Morrison and Charles then finished with a duet of "Crazy Love". Ray Charles remarked about this performance: "It meant a lot to sing 'Crazy Love' on stage that evening." "Genius Loves Company", Ray Charles' 2004 album, includes this duet featuring the two singers. Van Morrison and Bob Dylan sang a duet of "Crazy Love" on the BBC film, "One Irish Rover" in 1991.

Jason Palumbis (born July 15, 1969) is a former American football quarterback.
Football career.
Palumbis was a highly-recruited quarterback from Lakeridge High School in Lake Oswego, Oregon who played college football at Stanford University. The 6' 3", 200 lb. Palumbis was Stanford's primary starting quarterback from 1988 to 1990. In 1990, he set Stanford's single-season completion percentage record (.686 on 234 completions out of 341 attempts), a record that still stands. After a slow start in the 1991 season, Palumbis lost the starting role to Steve Stenstrom.
1990 Big Game.
Palumbis was Stanford's quarterback during one of Stanford's most dramatic comeback victories: the 93rd Big Game, played on November 17, 1990. In the game, which many Stanford fans consider to be the revenge for "The Play" eight years earlier, Stanford trailed 25-18 late in the game. With 12 seconds left, Palumbis threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Ed McCaffrey to make the score 25-24. Stanford failed to convert the two-point conversion, and the Cal fans rushed the field, thinking the game to be all but over. Cal was penalized 15 yards for delay of the game while the field had to be cleared, and Stanford's Dan Byers recovered the ensuing onside kick. As Palumbis tried to get Stanford in field goal range, his pass to McCaffrey fell short, but a Cal defender was called for roughing Palumbis. Stanford kicker John Hopkins connected on a 39-yard field goal as time expired, giving Stanford the 27-25 victory.
After football.
Palumbis played briefly for the San Antonio Force in the Arena Football League before retiring from football. He lives in Lake Oswego, Oregon.

District Council of Mallala

The District Council of Mallala was originally proclaimed in 1935 as the District Council of Light. It is the result of the amalgamation of the District Councils of Dublin, Port Gawler and Grace Plains. The District Council of Light was renamed the District Council of Mallala on 15 April 1937.
The first white settlement of the area dates back to the Port Gawler Special Survey in 1839. 
Originally the land was inhabited by the Kaurna people whose territory extended in a narrow corridor along the eastern shore of Gulf St Vincent; Cape Jervis to Port Wakefield; inland to near Crystal Brook, Snowtown, Blyth, Hoyleton, Hamley Bridge, Clarendon, Gawler, and Myponga; from the east side of the Hummock Range to Red Hill. Inland the stringy bark forests of the Mount Lofty Ranges marked their boundary.
Throughout the district large tracts of surveyed land were allotted to pastoralists who farmed mostly grain and sheep. The early produce of the area was often shipped out on ketches from the Ports of Gawler and Parham.
Both the Light River and the Gawler River pass through the district and the rich fertile plains are ideal for vegetable production, the majority of which is sent to the nearby Adelaide markets. As well as the general agricultural pursuits of grain growing and storage and running livestock, other major industries in the region include the livestock market / sale yards, metal fabrication and manufacture of industrial equipment.
Major towns.
Major towns that were established early on include Two Wells, Mallala and Dublin,
along with settlements at Barabba, Port Gawler, Redbanks, Wild Horse Plains and Port Parham.

<doc id="9885419" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9885419" title="Tip-speed ratio">
Tip-speed ratio

The tip-speed ratio, λ, or TSR for wind turbines is the ratio between the tangential speed of the tip of a blade and the actual velocity of the wind, formula_1. The tip-speed ratio is related to efficiency, with the optimum varying with blade design. Higher tip speeds result in higher noise levels and require stronger blades due to large centrifugal forces.
The tip speed of the blade can be calculated as formula_3 times R, where formula_3 is the rotor rotational speed in radians/second, and R is the rotor radius in meters. Therefore we can also write:
when wind speed is specified in meters/second.
Cp - λ curves.
The power co-efficient, formula_6 is a quantity that expresses what fraction of the power in the wind is being extracted by the wind turbine. It is generally assumed to be a function of both tip-speed ratio and pitch angle. Below is a plot of the variation of the power coefficient with variations in the tip-speed ratio when the pitch is held constant:
The case for variable speed wind turbines.
Originally, wind turbines were fixed speed. This has the benefit that the rotor speed in the generator is constant, thus the frequency of the AC Voltage is fixed. This allows the wind turbine to be directly connected to a transmission system. However, from the figure above, we can see that the power co-efficient is a function of the tip-speed ratio. By extension, the efficiency of the wind turbine is a function of the tip-speed ratio.
Ideally, one would like to have a turbine operating at the maximum value of formula_6 at all wind speeds. This means that as the wind speed changes, the rotor speed must change to such that formula_8. A wind turbine with a variable rotor speed is called a variable speed wind turbine. Whilst this does mean that the wind turbine operates at or close to formula_9 for a range of wind speeds, the frequency of the AC voltage generator will not be constant. This can be seen in the following equation:
formula_10
where formula_11 is the rotor angular speed, formula_12 is the frequency of the AC voltage generated in the stator windings, formula_13 is the number of poles in the generator inside the nacelle. That is, direct connection to a transmission system for a variable speed is not permissible. What is required is a power converter which converts the signal generated by the turbine generator into DC and then converts that signal to an AC signal with the grid/transmission system frequency.
The case against variable speed wind turbines.
As already mentioned, variable speed wind turbines cannot be directly connected to a transmission system. One of the drawbacks of this is that the inertia of the transmission system is reduced as more variable speed wind turbines are put online. This can result in more significant drops in the transmission system's voltage frequency in the event of the loss of a generating unit. Furthermore, variable speed wind turbines require power electronics, which increases the complexity of the turbine and introduces new sources of failures. It has also been suggested that additional energy capture achieved by comparing a variable speed wind turbine to a fixed speed wind turbine is approximately 2%.

Mount Hagen (German: "Hagensberg"), named after the German colonial officer Curt von Hagen, is the second highest volcano in Papua New Guinea and on the Australian continent, ranking behind only its neighbour Mount Giluwe which is roughly to the southwest. It is located on the border between the Western Highlands and Enga Provinces, about northwest of the city of Mount Hagen which is named after it.
Mount Hagen is an old stratovolcano which has been heavily eroded during several Pleistocene glaciations. The maximum extent of the glaciers on Hagen was less than half that on the much higher Mount Giluwe, covering an area of up to 50 km² (20 mi²) and extending down below 3,400 m (11,000 ft).

Johann Baptist Reus

Johann Baptist Reus, S.J. or João Batista Reus, S.J. (July 10, 1868 - July 21, 1947) was a Jesuit priest and a German-Brazilian religious leader.
Life.
John Baptist Reus was born to John and Ana Margarida Reus, on 10 July 1868, in Pottenstein, Bavaria, the eighth child of an 11 children. His parents, gave him excellent religious education. After completing a year of required military service, he resigned his commission 1890 and entered the Seminary of Bamberg, with an eye to eventually joining the Jesuits. He was ordained priest in 1893 entered the Order shortly thereafter.
Reus was ordained a priest in 1893, joined the Society of Jesus and was then sent to Brazil. He was a theology teacher for many years at the Cristo Rei college, located in the city of São Leopoldo in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
His autobiography and Diary, written in obedience to superiors, record mystical graces, and visions. He preferred to celebrate Mass in private chapel because of his many ecstasies during Mass. Only after fifty years as a member of the priesthood did he agree to celebrate Mass in a public chapel, because a Religion Community asked him to. He died in São Leopoldo, Brazil.
He wrote many books about theology and the natural sciences in many languages: in Portuguese, Spanish, German, Italian and English. His "Diário Espiritual" (spiritual diary) and "Autobiografia" (autobiography) reveal his unique mystical state of being.

Robert Hamilton Russell

Robert Hamilton Russell, FRCS, (3 September 1860 – 30 April 1933) was an English-born Australian surgeon, president of the Medical Society of Victoria from 1903.
Early life.
Russell was born at Farningham, Kent, England, the youngest son of James Russell, a farmer, and his wife Ellen, "née" Phillips. Russell was educated at Nassau school, Barnes, London, and then from 1878 at the medical school of King's College Hospital where he was a pupil of Joseph Lister's eventually becoming the last of the house surgeons who worked under his personal guidance. Russell took the diploma of M.R.C.S. in 1882 and, after experience as a house surgeon at King's College hospital, went to Shrewsbury for two years as resident surgeon at the Royal Salop Infirmary 1884–85. Russell then studied in Continental Europe before returning to England in 1889 suffering a lung condition (possibly tuberculosis), and became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (London).
Australia.
Russell went to Australia for the benefit of his health, arriving in 1890 and established himself at Hawthorn a suburb of Melbourne, as a general practitioner. Here he became doctor to the Granger family and commenced a lifelong friendship with Percy Grainger. Russell was, however, anxious to do surgical work and in 1892 was appointed a member of the honorary staff of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. Russell became particularly interested in the problem of inguinal hernia in the young and read a paper on this subject at the intercolonial medical congress at Brisbane in 1899. This and other papers on allied subjects were published in "The Lancet" in 1899 and 1900. In 1901 Russell was appointed to the honorary surgical staff of The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne. In 1903 Russell was elected president of the Medical Society of Victoria, his presidential address was an exposition on "The Congenital Origin of Hernia", given in January 1904. His reputation as a surgeon was now established, and his papers in medical journals were giving him worldwide recognition; some particularly important and original work dealt with the treatment of fractures. Russell was in England when World War I broke out and did valuable work both in France and England in the earlier years of it. On his return to Australia he took up his work again at the Alfred and Children's hospitals, but resigned his Alfred hospital appointment in 1920 and five years later retired from the children's hospital. In 1920 he founded the Victorian Association of Surgeons. After his retirement he retained his interest in surgery and particularly in the foundation of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons at Melbourne. At the annual meeting of the fellows of that college in 1930 he was presented with his portrait by George Washington Lambert. He had been a member of the council from its inception, and at the time of his death was as censor-in-chief entrusted with the controlling of admissions to fellowship. In later years he suffered from osteoarthritis, became very lame, and was threatened with the loss of the sight of one of his eyes. This may have been a contributing cause of the accident by which he lost his life while driving a motor car on 30 April 1933. He never married, he was cremated and the remains returned to England.
Legacy.
Russell was well-spoken and urbane, he was also an excellent pianist and had an appreciation of the best music; Percy Grainger recollected him as 'the first exquisite pianist in my life'. Russell was a fine surgeon and a remarkable clinical teacher. Every case was made the subject of careful, accurate and complete study, and every student was trained to think on surgical lines, always with the proviso that the recovery of the patient was the important thing. As a student of Lister he believed in the importance of the dressing of the wounds, and to go the rounds with him while he explained the reason for each method of application was an education in itself. Russell was not a believer in complicated methods of surgery and was always seeking the simplest way. He earned the affection and admiration of all his students, and his great ability made him a member of the small band of Australian medical men whose influence has been felt outside his own country. There is a bust of Russell by Paul Montford at the Alfred hospital, and an intermediate hospital block attached to the Alfred hospital has been named Hamilton Russell House in his memory.

Glaciolacustrine deposits

Sediments deposited into lakes that have come from glaciers are called glaciolacustrine deposits. These lakes include ice margin lakes or other types formed from glacial erosion or deposition. Sediments in the bedload and suspended load are carried into lakes and deposited. The bedload is deposited at the lake margin while the suspended load is deposited all over the lake bed.
Bedload deposits.
Sediments carried in the bedload of a stream, mostly sands and gravels, are deposited in deltas that form at the edges of lakes. These deposits will only be found near the edges of the lake.
Suspended deposits.
Sediments that are carried in the suspended load of a stream, commonly silts and clays, are transported into the lake in suspension or by currents along the lake floor. These are the principal deposits during the winter because of lack of melting of the glacier so the stream has a reduced discharge therefore carrying less coarse material. These sediments normally consist of fine-grained rhythmites that are laid down in layers known as varves or varvites. A varve represent an annual deposit of silt and clay. Sedimentation in deltas also occurs in rhythmic patterns as in the lake deposits, but they are thicker and contain coarse-grained materials instead of just silt and clay. As the varves get closer to the shoreline the clay layer will stay relatively the same thickness, but there will be an increase in thickness of the silt layer.

Chill Out, Scooby-Doo!

Chill Out, Scooby-Doo! is the eleventh "Scooby-Doo" direct-to-video film series, produced by Warner Bros. Animation (though it used a Hanna-Barbera logo and copyright at the end of the movie) which began in late 2006. It was dedicated to Iwao Takamoto, who died during the making of the film. It is a semi-remake of the classic "Scooby" episodes, "That's Snow Ghost!", "The Ghost of Bigfoot", and "There's No Creature Like Snow Creature" as well as "A Scary Night With a Snow Beast Fright", except it takes place in the Himalayas and features the Abominable Snowman. The film debuted on Cartoon Network on August 31, 2007, with a September 4, 2007, release date for the DVD. It was the final direct-to-video "Scooby-Doo" movie that Joseph Barbera was involved with (but was not dedicated to him; instead, "" carried a dedication to him).
Plot.
On a climbing expedition in the Himalayas, Professor Jeffries is led by his Sherpa, Pemba to a high point on a mountain with an ancient tablet with writing on it. Jeffries is out looking for the Abominable Snowman who lives in a cave in one of the mountains. He is convinced that the Snowman lives close by, but Pemba tells him he will not lead Jeffries anymore, as it would be intruding on the territory of the snowman. Jeffries, who seems to care about the snowman over the safety of Pemba, decides to cut the rope and continue. As soon as Jeffries fades from view, Pemba sees the out line of a large creature in front of him.
Meanwhile, Fred, Velma, and Daphne are on vacation in Paris. However, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy have not arrived yet, and the gang wonders where they are. Shaggy and Scooby are in a small plane that they think is going to Paris, but is really going to the Himalayas to drop off Alphonse LaFleur, a world famous French hunter and trapper. LaFleur wants to find and kill the snowman, and is taking Shaggy and Scooby along as bait. The pilot questions whether the monster is real, but Lafleur tells him it is. LaFleur then locks Shaggy and Scooby up with his equipment, and throws them off the plane. Shaggy, realizing they are not going to Paris, manages to get a quick phone call through to Fred before the phone goes dead. Fred uses the GPS on his phone to track them, and then he, Velma, and Daphne head to the Himalayas to find them. Velma wonders if it has anything to do with the legend of the creature in the Himalayas.
Meanwhile, Shaggy and Scooby manage to land near a small village on the mountain. In the village are Jeffries and Pemba. Jeffries tells Pemba he never should have left him, and that he almost died on the mountain. Many of the other villagers are leaving, fearing the creature and its wrath. Shaggy and Scooby go to the High Lama to ask for a phone to call their friends. The High Lama, a strange person, tells them there is only a phone on the weather station nearby. Scooby finds a room where the villagers worship the Snowman. The High Lama is uneasy about letting them go in, but lets them. In it is a statue of the Snowman holding a very large crystal, and Jeffries asks if he could see it, but the High Lama says no and closes the door. They then meet Pemba's sister Minga, who has decided to stay in the village. Minga is constantly listening to the radio, and has a crush on the DJ of the station she is listening to. Pemba tells her to leave the village, and he, Shaggy, Scooby, and Jeffries (who says that everyone should stick together), decide to go to the weather station. LaFleur arrives, and decides to accompany them.
As they travel, Minga runs up to them and says that she heard on the radio that a big storm is approaching. Shaggy wonders how there could be any reception so high up, and Pemba tells him there isn't, its just the weather station man pretending to be a DJ. Pemba is annoyed that Minga did not leave the village, and thinks she just wants to see the weather station man, but she tells him there really is a storm. Everyone looks up and sees a dark cloud, and they decide to set up camp to wait out the storm. During the night, Jeffries gets out of his tent and leaves with his sled, which is filled with TNT and other explosives. Some time later, the Snowman attacks Shaggy and Scooby, who were standing watch. LaFleur tries to capture the Snowman, but all his traps backfire and work on him. Scooby and Shaggy manage to lose the Snowman but get lost themselves. However, they are relieved to see a snowplow approach them. In it is Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster|Del Chillman, whom the gang had meet before. From Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster Del takes them to the weather station, where he works. Chillman tells them he decided to take the job so he could find out if the legend of the creature is true. He also reveals that he is the DJ. He had the radio just to do weather reports, but plays songs to pass the time.
Meanwhile, Fred, Velma, and Daphne get to the village and see it is deserted. They follow Shaggy’s tracks and see where the party camped the night before, and also the foot prints of the Snowman. Velma notes that they are not very deep in the snow. They find Pemba, who was caught by one of LaFleur's traps. Minga is nowhere to be found and Jeffries is still gone, so the gang decides to split up and search for everyone else. At the weather station, Chillman goes out to look for the others. Once he leaves the Snowman appears and attacks Shaggy and Scooby. As they run away, LaFleur shows up and tries to capture the creature, but falls of a cliff, apparently to his death. Scooby and Shaggy manage to escape and find their way to the lost kingdom of Shangri-La, and meet the High Lama but are pursued by the Snowman.
Del catches up to the rest of the gang, but finds the weather station destroyed and some helium cases missing. As Scooby and Shaggy walk around the city, the Snowman appears and gives chase. Daphne and Pemba find a large cave and go inside, and conclude that is where the monster lives. They also find an empty helium case. Shaggy and Scooby lose the monster again, and everyone meets up in an old mine, each coming from a different direction. There they see Jeffries mining for lots of crystals like the one on the yeti statue. They conclude he is the snowman and capture him, although he says he is not. Then the snowman appears and chases everyone, while Jeffries gets free and follows them. The monster chases Shaggy, Scooby, and Jeffries down the mountain. Jeffries is trying to get the crystals that are in the mine cart that Scooby and Shaggy are riding in. The rest of the gang prepares a trap for the Snowman, but Shaggy, Scooby, and Jeffries get caught in it. The High Lama comes out to see what happened. Then an avalanche starts, and almost crushes Velma and Del, but the Snowman saves them at the last moment. The creature is unmasked to be Minga, who has been behind the mystery from the very beginning. She used the helium to fly, which caused the footprints to not be as deep. She did it so the weather station man would not stop broadcasting his radio show. Del is touched by Minga's actions. Jeffries is taken to jail because he was taking the crystals for his own gain. The gang wonders if there really is a Snowman, but then LaFleur appears and tells them that something saved him from his fall and brought him to the village.
The gang, along with Del and Minga, return to Paris for their vacation. Unfortunately, Fred gets on the wrong plane and ends up in the Amazon as the others head there.

Bill Barrot (born 6 May 1944) is a former professional Australian rules football player who played in the Victorian Football League (VFL), the South Australian Football League (SANFL) and the Victorian Football Association (VFA). 
Barrott made his senior VFL in 1961 for Richmond Football Club where he was known with popular affection as "Bustling Billy". Playing as a centreman, Barrot was a best and fairest winner in 1965, an interstate representative and a major driving force behind the Tigers' 1967 grand final win. However, Barrot was prone to injury that limited his senior VFL appearances for the Tigers to just 120 in ten seasons.
In 1971, Barrot was traded to St Kilda in exchange for Ian Stewart. Barrot never truly settled at Moorabbin Oval, managing just a couple of games, and later in the year he was traded to Carlton Football Club, where he finished his VFL career.
In 1972 Barrot played for VFA side Oakleigh which had endured a lean time for more than a decade. Barrot's impact, both on and off the field, was immediate and pronounced, and the Devils lost the first division grand final.
Moving to Adelaide, Barrot was appointed as captain-coach of SANFL club West Torrens. After running seventh in 1973 the Eagles endured a horror start to the 1974 season which ultimately precipitated Barrot's departure, in somewhat acrimonious circumstances, midway through the year. He finished his career back at Oakleigh, where he took over as coach.
Years later whilst playing in a Richmond legends game, Barrot suffered a heart attack and almost died on the field.

Parn

Parn is a fictional character in the "Record of Lodoss War" fantasy manga and its derivative anime franchise. 
He plays a major role in the series, especially in the light novels, manga and OVA, and is the central protagonist in the manga saga "The Grey Witch". He also plays a major role in the beginning of "", but this role is diminished after the eighth episode, where a new protagonist, "Spark", takes the lead.
Description.
In the OVA series, Parn begins as a simple village youth, but through extraordinary circumstances dons his father's armour and sword, and takes on the role of a fighter. This differs from his introduction in the manga series, where he is already a mercenary when discovered by the rest of his party. It is never disclosed in the OVA or "Chronicles of the Heroic Knight" as to what Parn's age is.
Parn specializes in the use of bastard sword. In the beginning of the OVA series, he wields his father's sword until it is destroyed. At this point, he is granted the Holy Sword of Falis to continue his journey. Parn's romantic interest comes in the form of Deedlit, an elven princess.
Character history.
Parn grew up in a more or less peaceful village, with the only real concern being a nearby goblin tribe. As a child, he was ostracized by the others, because his father had a black mark against his name. Parn later learned from King Fahn that his father willingly made himself look like a rogue knight so that he could rescue the king's infant daughter from the people of Flaim, who were intending to offer her up as a sacrifice to Shooting Star, an ancient red dragon who was terrorizing them at the time. He was successful in this endeavor and also allowed Fahn to avoid any personal blame for the incident, however Flaim and Valis still ended up going to war. When he was called, Tessius silently rode to the front and was killed on the battlefield before his name could be restored.
Growing up, Parn idolized his father, remembering him as a great man, despite what the others had to say about him and knowing him only as a man of honor. Never knowing the circumstances of his father's fall from grace, he knew his father only as a kind and gentle man with a warrior's spirit.
Parn had a best friend by the name of Etoh, who left the village to become a priest of Falis, the Supreme God, a couple of years before the story begins. He was also a good friend with the mayor's daughter, and may have even been childhood sweethearts with her, although this is only implied.
Role in the OVA series.
At the beginning of the OVA series, Parn fends off a group of goblins, rescuing the mayor's daughter from them, and killing one in the process. Because of his actions, there is a dispute among the villagers about what must be done, and Parn decides he will deal with the goblins alone, but is then joined by his childhood friend Etoh, who returned to the village at the same time as the attack.
After taking part in the defense of the village, the mayor decides to do Parn a favor. To help him save face, the mayor secretly exiles Parn, asking him to leave the village, but publicly declaring that Parn is leaving to scout out the land, and see what news there is of a possible upcoming war with the country of Marmo.
During his travels, Parn manages to meet several other characters, including an elf named Deedlit, a dwarf named Ghim, a sorcerer named Slayn, and a thief named Woodchuck. Ghim and several others act as mentors to Parn and attempt to teach him to defend himself, though Parn's skills are lacking, as Deedlit remarks that he "needs help". When, by happenstance, Parn and his comrades rescue Princess Fianna, Parn comes into good graces with Fahn, the king of Valis, and Kashue, the king of Flaim. They send Parn and his comrades on a mission to gain intelligence about the Karla the Grey Witch, who is a wildcard in ongoing War of Heroes between Marmo and Lodoss.
When Parn returns, Fahn reveals that his father, whom most thought had died dishonorably, had actually died a hero, acting on his own in order to save the then infant Princess Fianna and save the kingdom from war. Parn is then granted the title of "Holy Knight of Valis", a title which he accepts but never uses by name, instead preferring to simply be known as "Parn".
During the war with Marmo, Fahn is killed in a duel with Emperor Beld. Karla then kills Beld as well, to prevent either side from becoming too powerful. Seeking justice for her actions, Parn and his friends go to Karla's stronghold. Karla attempts to sway Parn to her side, but he refuses. In the end, Karla is defeated at the cost of Ghim's life; however, Karla manages to possess the body of Woodchuck in order to make her escape.
Afterwards, Parn is forced to go to the cursed island of Marmo when Wagnard abducts Deedlit to uses her as a reagent for a spell. Fighting for Deedlit's life, Parn overcomes many obstacles, and with the help of the opposing blades, Beld's demon blade named Soul Crusher and Fahn's holy blade (which is called the Holy Sword of Falis ), he is able to stop the spell and save Deedlit's life.
At the end of the series, Kashue grants upon Parn the esteemed title of "Knight of Lodoss", which later derives into his more commonly used title in the second series of "The Free Knight.
Role in "Chronicles of the Heroic Knight".
Parn once again serves as the protagonist for this series, but only for the first eight episodes. Presented in a different light, Parn is slightly stronger and has more skill in this series, which takes place approximately five years after the death of Ghim.
Parn is the one who peacefully befriends Shiris, but due to a mistake on what was taking place, her partner and best friend Orson attacks him in his berserker mode, trying to kill him. He nearly delivers a fatal blow, but like in the OVA, Shiris stops him from doing so.
Parn works with the other characters to uncover what the Marmo forces have been plotting, discovering that their intent is to acquire the Scepter of Domination. He assists Kashue with trying to prevent the sceptre from falling into the hands of Ashram, and also assists in the slaying of the red dragon Shooting Star.
At this point, Parn's role in the series becomes marginal, and he has hardly any screen time at all. After one final battle which ends in a stalemate, Parn and Ashram both agree to go their separate ways, with Ashram admitting that he is going to leave Marmo with the rest of his people to search for peace.
Voices.
In "Record of Lodoss War", Parn is voiced by Takeshi Kusao. His English voice actor for the US Manga Corps dub is Bill Timoney, credited as Billy Regan.
In "Chronicles of the Heroic Knight", the voice of Parn is changed as he is now voiced by Nobutoshi Canna. However, his English voice actor remains the same, as Timoney reprises the role for the second series.
Origins.
Parn is based on a role-playing game character of the same name, played by the Japanese translator/game designer Nao Kitagawa who translated the Stormbringer role-playing game to Japanese. Kitagawa was an ardent fan of Michael Moorcock, so he jokingly called own character Parn, "Eternal champion". However, in the game sessions, Parn was dubbed as from his personality: muri (no way), mucha (nonsense) and mubou (reckless).
Parn was a character for the Forcelia campaign world, which was offered to TSR at one point, but rejected due to current policies. A human fighter, Parn has a delight in using the bastard sword.

Space Test Program

The Space Test Program (STP) is the primary provider of spaceflight for the United States Department of Defense (DOD) space science and technology community. STP is conducted by the Space Development and Test Wing of the United States Air Force. STP provides spaceflight via the Space Shuttle, International Space Station, piggybacks, secondary payloads and dedicated launch services.
STP-1 Launch.
On March 9, 2007, six satellites were launched into LEO on a shared Atlas V launch vehicle. The satellites were:
The satellites shared the launcher through use of an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA). United Launch Alliance provided a video feed of the launch.
STP-S26.
STP-S26
Activities during 2001.
During August 2001 STP conducted two successful activities using the Shuttle and ISS. STS-105 delivered and successfully deployed the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) externally on the ISS. MISSE, a passive materials exposure experiment, is the first external experiment on ISS. In addition, STS-105 retrieved and returned MACE II (Middeck Active Control Experiment II) from the ISS. MACE II was the first experiment on ISS and was operated for nearly a year.
On September 30, 2001, STP and NASA launched the "Kodiak Star" mission on an Athena I launch vehicle. This was the first orbital launch out of Kodiak Island, Alaska. In addition to NASA's Starshine III spacecraft, this mission included three small DoD spacecraft which tested a variety of new space technologies.
STP and the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Space Vehicles Directorate developed a secondary payload adapter ring for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), which can host up to six 400-pound micro satellites. STP also worked closely with NASA and the United States Navy on the Geosynchronous Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer/Indian Ocean Meteorology and Oceanography Imager project.
In December 2001, STS-108 hosted the Ram Burn Observation (RAMBO) Experiment and Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Localized Exhaust (SIMPLEX) experiment. RAMBO used an operational satellite to view Shuttle engine firings to optimize band selection for SBIRS and improve the fidelity of DOD plume models. SIMPLEX observed ionospheric disturbances created by Shuttle engine burns via ground radar sites and supported plume technology, plume signature, and space weather modeling.
Activities during 2002.
RAMBO and SIMPLEX flew again on STS-110 in April 2002.
In June 2002, RAMBO was again successful on STS-111 with a total of four Shuttle engine burns viewed. STP also worked to obtain a 1-year radio frequency license extension for the Picosat experiment launched on the September 2001 "Kodiak Star" mission.
Activities during 2003.
On January 6, 2003, STP and the Naval Research Laboratory launched the Coriolis satellite, a risk-reduction effort for NPOESS, aboard a Titan II launch vehicle.
2008.
The C/NOFS (Communications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System) satellite, which was launched on 2008-04-16, will be operated by the Space Test Program.
Upcoming Activities.
The STP-2 payload is scheduled to be launched aboard a Falcon Heavy in mid-2015. The payload should include an ISAT (Innovative Spacebased radar Antenna Technology) flight demonstrator satellite massing over 5000kg. The ISAT program aims to deploy extremely large (up to 300 yards) electronically scanning radar antennas in orbit.

Cinta Larga people

The Cinta Larga (or Cinturão Largo) are a people indigenous to the western Amazon Rainforest of Brazil, numbering around 1300. Their name means "broad belt" in Portuguese, referring to large bark sashes the tribe once wore. The tribe is famous for shadowing Theodore Roosevelt's Roosevelt–Rondon Scientific Expedition, making no contact.
Language.
The Cinta Larga language is a Mondé language, belonging to the Tupi language family. It is written in the Latin script.
History.
Since the 1920s, the tribe has often come into violent conflict with prospectors entering the region to harvest rubber, timber, gold or diamonds. In the 1960s, this culminated in the "Massacre at Parallel 11" in which rubber prospectors killed many of the Cinta Larga.
Diamond mine controversy.
In 2004 the tribe was responsible for the murders of 29 miners illegally unearthing diamonds in the area. In exchange for an $810,000 community grant from the Brazilian government, the tribe agreed to shut down the mine and refrain from killing intruders. The grant expired in 2007, and the tribe has implied it may reopen the mine.

Julius Avitus

Julius Avitus also known by his full name Gaius Julius Avitus Alexianus (flourished second half of the 2nd century & first half of the 3rd century, died 217) was a Syrian nobleman who had an impressive Roman military and political career.
Background & Career.
Although Alexianus was a Roman citizen who was born and raised in Emesa (modern Homs, Syria), little is known on his origins. It has been assumed that Alexianus was born in c. 155. What is known about him is from surviving inscriptional and Roman historical evidence. Through marriage he was a relation to the Royal family of Emesa and the ruling Severan dynasty of the Roman Empire.
He was an Equestrian officer serving as a Prefect and Tribune in the Roman military. Alexianus after served as a Procurator of the food supply in Rome, being stationed in Ostia.
Later he was promoted to the Roman Senate by the Roman emperor Lucius Septimius Severus. Having entered the Senate with the rank of Praetor in 194, Alexianus was made Legatus in the Legio IV Flavia Felix and later served as Proconsul of Raetia which may be dated to 196/197. During his proconsulship of Raetia, he dedicated an altar to the Emesene God Elagabalus. The altar and its inscription still intact, mentions him as a priest of the deified Roman emperor Titus.
Alexianus served as a Roman consul in 200, even perhaps as early as 198 or 199. After his consulship, Alexianus didn’t served in a Roman military nor political position, probably due to Septimius Severus’ hostilities from the Praetorian prefect Gaius Fulvius Plautianus. After the death of Plautianus in 205, Alexianus took part in Septimius Severus’ expedition in Britain where he acted as a Comes (Companion) to the emperor from 208 until 211.
Under Septimius Severus’ successor Caracalla, for two years Alexianus served as a Prefect of the Italian orphanages. He served as a Legatus in Dalmatia in c. 214 and later as a Proconsul in Asia and in Mesopotamia. In 216–217, Alexianus became a Comes to Caracalla on his campaign against the Sassanid Empire. He died from old age on his way to Cyprus being sent by Caracalla in early 217 to act as an advisor to the Governor.
Marriage & Issue.
Alexianus married the Syrian noblewoman Julia Maesa the first daughter of Gaius Julius Bassianus, a High Priest of the "Temple of the Sun". The temple was dedicated to the Syrian Aramaic Sun God "El-Gebal" (counterpart to the Phoenician Baal) in Emesa. The younger sister of Maesa was the Roman empress Julia Domna wife of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus who was the mother of the Roman emperors Caracalla and Publius Septimius Geta.
Maesa bore two distinguished daughters to Avitus who were born and raised in Syria: 
Among his grandchildren were the Roman emperors Elagabalus (born as Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus) and Alexander Severus (born as Marcus Julius Gessius Bassianus Alexianus).

<doc id="9886076" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9886076" title="Greek (TV series)">
Greek (TV series)

Greek (stylised as GRΣΣK) is an American drama television series that ran from July 9, 2007 to March 7, 2011 on ABC Family. The series follows students of the fictional Cyprus-Rhodes University (CRU), located in Ohio, who participate in the school's Greek system. The show's plots often take place within the confines of the fictional fraternities, Kappa Tau Gamma (ΚΤΓ) and Omega Chi Delta (ΩΧΔ), or the fictional sorority, Zeta Beta Zeta (ΖΒZ). Throughout the course of the series, other non-Greek characters and situations are introduced, but they all tie into larger relationships with the Greeks. The series follows Rusty and Casey Cartwright as they endure the events surrounding the Greek system at Cyprus-Rhodes. There are six chapters, arranged into four seasons.
Production.
Filmed primarily in Los Angeles, the show is also filmed on location at the UCLA campus in the Westwood district of Los Angeles. Many campus scenes have also been shot at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California, outside of Los Angeles. They've also filmed at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The exterior and some interior shots were filmed in the historic West Adams District within Los Angeles. The house used in the pilot to establish the ZBZ residence is the same house used in the reality series "Beauty and the Geek".
The first season was halted in September 2007 due to the Writers Guild of America strike and returned March 24, 2008, to a triple digit increase in ratings over the pilot's premiere. On May 1, 2008, ABC Family renewed "Greek" for a second season, premiering August 26, 2008. The series was moved from the Tuesday lineup to Monday nights. Twelve more episodes were ordered for late spring 2009 and aired beginning March 30. On January 31, 2009, it was announced that "Greek" would return for a third season, premiering on August 31, 2009. The midseason premiere of Greek was Monday, Jan. 25, at 10/9c.
On February 19, 2010, it was reported that the show had been renewed for a fourth, ten-episode season. Then, on March 13, 2010, creator Sean Smith announced his plans to end the series after the fourth season, saying, "We plan to end, that's the plan. We're all looking at this as an opportunity to come back, wrap up the show, and end strong. ABC Family could have ended it, but they gave us this opportunity and I don't want to squander it." On July 29, 2010, it was confirmed that the fourth and final season of Greek would air beginning in January 2011. The series finale aired on March 7, 2011.
Synopsis.
The pilot episode premiered on Monday, July 9, 2007 in the US on ABC Family. The series finale aired on Monday, March 7, 2011.
Season One.
Chapter One.
Rusty Cartwright (Jacob Zachar) is a freshman at Cyprus-Rhodes University, and in an effort to shed his nerdy image, goes through Greek recruitment. His older sister, Casey (Spencer Grammer), is an active member of the Zeta Beta Zeta sorority (the top sorority on campus), and is dating Omega Chi Delta active Evan Chambers (Jake McDorman), who is wealthy and popular because of his father's company, Chambers International. Evan is the Pledge Educator of the Omega Chi (the top fraternity on campus) and offers Rusty a spot in Omega Chi. But Rusty declines after Evan gets spotted cheating on Casey with the Senator's daughter (and Zeta Beta Zeta pledge), Rebecca Logan (Dilshad Vadsaria). Rusty later accepts an invitation for Kappa Tau Gamma fraternity by the fun and laid back Cappie (Scott Michael Foster), Casey's ex-boyfriend and Evan's enemy. Additionally, Rusty's religious Baptist roommate, Dale (Clark Duke), is concerned for Rusty's involvement with the Greeks, but later accepts Rusty's new lifestyle, even befriending Rusty's gay friend Calvin (Paul James), an Omega Chi legacy and pledge. After Casey finds out about Evan and Rebecca, Frannie (Tiffany Dupont), ZBZ president and Casey's "big sister", convinces Casey to stay with Evan. Casey and Cappie sleep together to get revenge on Evan, but it was just a "one time thing." Rusty and Jen K., a ZBZ pledge, begin dating after they help the Kappa Tau's save Vesuvius. Despite all the cheating and tension, Evan lavalieres Casey (gives her his Greek letters). Ashleigh (Amber Stevens), Casey's best friend and fellow ZBZ member, ends her long-distance relationship with boyfriend, Travis, and she attempts to move on to Calvin, who she finds out is gay. He gets accidentally outed by Ashleigh to all of Omega Chi, but Evan reassures him to stay in the fraternity. During the season, Calvin and Heath, a Kappa Tau, have an on-and-off fling. When Frannie finds out she won't be graduating next year, she runs for Omega Chi sweetheart again, against Casey. Meanwhile, Cappie and Rebecca begin a flirtatious relationship after doing a psych experiment together. A large scandal for the Greeks erupts after Rusty's new girlfriend, Jen K (Jessica Rose), a Zeta Beta Zeta pledge, writes a newspaper article based on the scandals and controversies of the Greeks and gets them in trouble with Dean Bowman, forcing the university to lay down strict rules and monitoring on the Greeks. Since Jen K was a ZBZ pledge, the article centers on the Zeta Beta Zeta sorority and ZBZ National Board interferes and forces Frannie to step down as president and has Casey take her place as interim president. In retaliation, Frannie then tells Evan that the only reason Casey decided to stay with him after he cheated was because of his reputation. As a result, Evan and Casey break up. Rusty and Jen K. also break up since Rusty can no longer trust her.
Chapter Two.
Cappie and Rebecca begin a secret fling while Casey and Rusty try to respectively get over their exes. The schools begins to set strict restrictions on the Greek system in response to the newspaper article. A ZBZ alumna, Lizzie, must live with the sisters to ensure no scandals occur again. The ZBZs pair up with the Kappa Tau's to throw a Gatsby-themed Prohibition party. Rusty has some trouble accepting that he and Calvin are in rivalry fraternities, but they end up solving their differences in the season finale. Cappie and Rebecca go public about their relationship, which makes Casey uneasy. By accepting Frannie back into the sorority, Lizzie leaves Casey and the rest of the ZBZ's. In light of the Greek Ball, there is a flashback to freshman year. Cappie and Evan used to be roommates and decided to rush together. Both were admitted to Kappa Tau, but Evan left after discovering he was only admitted because of Cappie. Cappie and Casey started dating, but Casey was stood up, waiting for Cappie to pick her up for the ball. Frannie confronted Cappie for standing up Casey. But Casey decided to go to the ball with Evan, and the two end up together by the end of the night. Now, Casey, Ashleigh and Frannie decide to go to the ball together, without dates, and Cappie goes with Rebecca. The Kappa Tau's protest against the CRU board, with the help of Evan, and the Greeks retain their special treatment on campus. Rusty begins hooking up with USAG member and Dale's friend, Tina, which ends because Rusty feels uncomfortable having casual sex. Turns out, Rusty gets crabs from Tina. Meanwhile, Casey attempts to move on from Evan multiple times, all of which were unsuccessful. However, Evan still isn't over Casey and enlists in Calvin to prevent other guys from talking to her. Calvin begins a relationship with Michael, (Max Greenfield). Casey tries to become more serious about her future by seeking Evan for help with pre-law. Everyone goes to Myrtle Beach for Spring Break. There, Ashleigh encounters the "Hotness Monster" and becomes crazed with finding him. Rebecca finds out her dad is running a prostitution ring and gets extremely drunk. She almost enters a wet tshirt concert, but ends up breaking up with Cappie since he is "beneath her." Cappie and Casey go on a romantic stroll down the beach and end up kissing. However, Cappie realizes what happened to Rebecca and decides to comfort her. Evan and Frannie spark a relationship and Rusty and Calvin work out their differences.
Season Two.
Chapter Three.
A video of Rebecca's little scandal from Myrtle Beach goes viral and the ZBZ's advise her to lay low. However, Rebecca begins to snap, and national ZBZ rep Tegan advises Casey to remove her. However, Casey and the other ZBZs stand by her side to support Rebecca through her troubling times. The season opens up with Greek Week, a competition against the sororities and fraternities. Rebecca decides to coach the Kappa Tau's, who find her controlling and rude. Frannie coaches the Omega Chi's and Casey coaches the Lambda Sig's. Casey tries to flirt with the Lambda Sig president, but Evan pays him to stay away from Casey. Meanwhile, Frannie tries to tell Casey about her and Evan, but Casey finds out after seeing them kissing during the Greek Week championship ceremony. Casey later begins crushing on Drew, who turns out to be Ashleigh's "Hotness Monster" from Spring Break. After fighting over him, neither of them end up with him since he seemed uninterested in Ashleigh and Casey isn't totally over the whole Frannie and Evan thing. After "processing" Frannie and Evan's relationship for a while, Casey ultimately decides that she and Frannie cannot be friends since she is chose a boy over their friendship. When Rebecca realizes Cappie isn't serious enough to help her cope with her family issues and still isn't over Casey, the two decide to break up. Ashleigh suddenly realizes she has a spending problem and Rusty is in desperate need of the car. So, Casey and Ashleigh enlist in Rusty's RA, Max (Michael Rady) to help them count cards and win money at the Omega Chi's casino night. Casey becomes interested in Max, and the two start dating shortly thereafter. Frannie, Ashleigh and Casey go to Florida for a ZBZ convention, and Frannie successfully overturns a rule about an ex-officer rerunning for their lost position (revealing her intentions to rerun for President against Casey). Meanwhile, Calvin cheats on Michael with Heath, his flame from Season 1, and the two break up since Calvin doesn't really know what he wants. Cappie and Rebecca briefly try to be friends with benefits, but she's not entirely over him and he's not entirely over Casey. Casey worries that her geeky boyfriend, Max may jeopardize her presidency campaign, but she later realizes that she cares more about Max than his reputation (unlike Evan). After some ugly politics between Frannie and Casey, Ashleigh unexpectedly wins the ZBZ presidency. Despite winning the presidency, Ashleigh has trouble performing her duties with Frannie and Casey both trying to influence her decisions. Meanwhile, Rusty runs into Jen K. and they try to rekindle their relationship, but he realizes he will never get over what she did to the Greeks. In the season finale, Rusty and Calvin both become actives in their respective fraternities, Kappa Tau and Omega Chi. Max gets accepted to CalTech and Casey gets an internship in Washington DC. The two seem to decide to split, seeing that a long distance relationship would not work. And during ZBZ initiation, Frannie announces that she's starting her own sorority, with financial help from Evan, and Rebecca must make a choice between Frannie and the ZBZs.
Chapter Four.
At the beginning of Season 4, we see that Max decides to stay at Cyprus-Rhodes for grad school to stay with Casey. Rebecca becomes a spy for the ZBZs by "joining" Frannie's sorority, the Iota Kappa Iotas, but she gets caught and returns to the ZBZs. Evan becomes President of the Omega Chi's and tries to recruit Calvin's high school friend Andy (Jesse McCartney), an all-state football star. New ZBZ president Ashleigh assumes full responsibility by taking over from interim president Casey, however Casey remains a prominent figure in the house by becoming Rush Chair and Pledge Educator. During Rush, Rusty takes a liking to Andy and convinces him to join the Kappa Tau house over the Omega Chi house. Rusty, Dale and Calvin also take an Art History elective, and Rusty falls (literally) for a student named Jordan (Johanna Braddy). Jordan attends a Kappa Tau party on invite from Rusty, during which she makes out with Andy and decides to pledge ZBZ. Rusty's situation worsens when Cappie makes Rusty Andy's big brother and Andy and Jordan start dating. Later, Jordan and Rusty kiss, which Rusty admits to Andy, who leaves Kappa Tau. The betrayal of Rusty to his younger brother infuriates Cappie, who likens the situation to when Evan stole Casey from him. But when Cappie and Evan start reminiscing in their new secret group, they decide to put the past behind them and become friends, Cappie ultimately forgives Rusty, who starts dating Jordan after she choses him over Andy. Meanwhile, Rebecca briefly questions her sexuality after kissing another girl and seeks advice from Calvin. Calvin has trouble resisting his new gay roommate, Grant, and adopts Dale's purity ways to avoid conflict. Frannie keeps taking advantage of Evan's trust fund and he starts cheating on her. The two eventually end their relationship, and Evan declines his trust fund, since it's only causing him issues with others.

Reception.
"Greek" has received a score of 62 out of 100 from review aggregator Metacritic. In a review released soon after the premiere of the show, the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" called the show "light-hearted fun" and "authentic" while "the New York Times" claimed that "Greek" "captures the spirit of the hedge-fund age like nothing else." Other critics did not find the drama as authentic, with Elizabeth Fox of the "Philadelphia Inquirer" criticizing the show's predictability and lack of originality as another "teenage soap opera." Other reviews were middling, calling the writing of the show acceptable and praising the strength of the cast.
Members of the real life Greek community have claimed that "Greek"'s depiction of fraternity and sorority life is stereotypical. USC banned the show from filming on their campus, in reaction to the promotional poster featuring the "Greek" logo over a red cup, since the cup is often used to symbolize alcoholic consumption during parties. However, upon viewing the pilot episode they held off on sending a letter to ABC Family, complaining about the depiction of the Greek System, when they realized there was more to the show than just parties. Others recognize it as a hyperbolic representation of "tamer, more modest" Greek life.
The show has been noted by LGBT activists for the character of Calvin, a gay fraternity brother, who struggles with the stereotyping and homophobia that coming out of the closet entails. Critics have praised the character's "three dimensionality."
Awards and nominations.
In 2008, GLAAD nominated "Greek" for an Outstanding Drama Series award, and in 2009 they nominated the show in the Outstanding Comedy Series category. Actor Paul James was nominated for a 2009 Image Award as Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series. In 2010, it was again nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for "Outstanding Comedy Series" during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards.
Ratings.
The viewership for "Greek's" pilot episode was 1.1 million, and Chapter 2 ended with 1.3 million viewers.
Chapter 3 saw a ratings spike, premiering to 1.6 million viewers, a 78% increase, doubling and tripling their ratings in all demographics, marked a network high for male viewers, and was the 2nd most watched cable show with females age 12–34. "Greek" also appeared on the list of top ten downloads on iTunes. Chapter 4 premiered much lower, with 0.99 million viewers, and ended with 0.745 million.
The third season premiere (Chapter 5) had a total of 1.21 million viewers, down almost 2 million from its lead in, "The Secret Life of the American Teenager". The second episode pulled in 1.31 million viewers. Chapter 5 ended with 0.66 million viewers and Chapter 6 premiered with 1.033 million.
Online reality show spin-off.
In 2007, ABC Family created a website www.virtualrush.com that was to be used in conjunction with the Greek television series. The site was maintained during the first two seasons, in which the users of the site competed in a wide variety of contests in order to become an extra on the show.
During the first season of the contest, a five-part online reality series called Rush*d followed the six finalists that were selected by ABC Family staff from their hometowns and college campuses to Los Angeles.
The Finalists:
In the fifth episode of Rush'd, Laura Wise was announced the winner of the contest.
In season two of Virtual Rush, Tom Kruszewski – Puckstopper35, was announced as the winner of the second and final contest. Following the second season the website was rendered inert.
Specials.
In the United Kingdom, episodes are followed by special behind-the-scenes features entitled "Greek Uncovered", which can be found on the BBC iPlayer and on BBC Three. In the Australian iTunes Store, each week, a new episode (to Australia) will appear, after it is aired on Fox8.
DVD releases.
In 2008, ABC/Disney released Season 1 on DVD in two volumes, titled Chapter One and Chapter Two. In 2009, Season 2 was also released on DVD in two volumes, titled Chapter Three and Chapter Four.
In 2010, Shout! Factory secured the rights for the rest of the series and released Season 3 on DVD as a complete set, titled Chapter 5: The Complete Third Season. On October 18, 2011, Shout! Factory released "Greek: Chapter 6 - The Complete Fourth Season" as a Shout! Select title, available exclusively on their website.

I Want Out

"I Want Out" is a song by the German power metal band Helloween from the album "Keeper of the Seven Keys, Pt. 2", that was released as a single in 1988.
It was written by Kai Hansen, who said in an interview that it was a hint of him really wanting "out" of the band. Musically, the song is characterised by a recognisable introduction and Michael Kiske's trademark high pitched singing in the chorus. It is also punk-influenced (especially the rebellious lyrics) in contrast to other Helloween songs, or Hansen's post-Helloween work.
It is one of the Helloween's most recognizable songs, and is often performed live by Helloween and both Hansen's and Kiske's current bands Gamma Ray and Unisonic. The song was covered by HammerFall, Sonata Arctica, Avalanch and Skylark.

Peter Nicol Russell

Sir Peter Nicol Russell (4 July 1816 – 10 July 1905) was an Australian foundry owner, philanthropist and university benefactor.
Early life.
Russell was born at Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, the second son of eleven children of Robert Russell, an engineer and ironfounder, and his wife Janet, "née" Nicol. Peter was educated at Kirkcaldy Grammar School and was then employed in his father's business.
Career in Australia.
The family emigrated to Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) in 1832, and in 1838 moved to Sydney. In 1842 Peter Russell established a foundry and engineering business at Sydney and called it 'The Sydney Foundry and Engineering Works'. After the father's death this was carried on under the name of P. N. Russell and Company, and became the largest and most successful business of its kind in Australia. In 1860 Peter Russell went to London and virtually retired, except that he acted as London representative of the business. In 1875 this was closed down after industrial unrest. Russell, however, had prospered with his investments, and was now a rich man. He retained his interest in Australia, paid several visits to it, and in 1896 made a gift of £50,000 to the Sydney University to found an engineering school. In 1904 he made a second gift of £50,000 to be devoted to the same department, with the proviso that the government should provide £25,000 for buildings.
Legacy.
Russell died childless in London on 10 July 1905, aged 89. He married in 1859 Charlotte, daughter of Dr Alexander Lorimer. Russell was knighted in 1904. Under his will a total sum of £16,000 was left to various institutions and charities in Sydney. The engineering school at the University of Sydney is known as the 'Peter Nicol Russell School of Engineering', and there are three Peter Nicol Russell scholarships for mechanical engineering, and a medal for research work. His portrait by W. Q. Orchardson, R.A., is in the great hall, and there is a memorial group by Edgar Bertram Mackennal in the university grounds.
Peter Nicol Russell's company, P. N. Russell and Company, was associated with the construction of the heritage listed Denison Bridge at Bathurst.

George Nassar

George Nassar (born June 1932) is an American murderer; Albert DeSalvo allegedly confessed to being the Boston Strangler to Nassar in late 1965. Nassar contacted his lawyer F. Lee Bailey and informed him of this confession, which led to DeSalvo becoming the prime suspect in the unsolved Strangler murders.
Life.
Early life.
Nassar was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the oldest of two children of Henry Nassar and Helen (née George), both of Syriac descent. Henry had come to America with his parents as a child and worked at various mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He would pass away there in 1955. Helen was born in Dover, New Hampshire and worked as a bobbin setter in mills; a previous marriage (that ended in 1931) to a man named Lawrence Otis, yielded one son named after his father. Nassar has one sister named Eileen. Eileen and George grew up in Lawrence, and were Catholics. George was involved in sports, and was a Boy Scout. At school, his teachers found him reserved, quiet, and a poor mixer.
First murder.
George first ran afoul of the law while he was in his sophomore year. In May 1948, he and two of his friends, Gennaro Pullino and William Kenney went on a robbery spree that netted eighty dollars. In one of the places they hit, shopowner Dominic Kirmil lunged at the trio with a Coke bottle; Nassar pulled out a nickel-plated revolver from his dark-colored trench coat and shot Kirmil four times. The shopkeeper died three hours later from the loss of blood. Several witnesses described Nassar's distinct trench coat to the police.
On May 20, Nassar was picked up by Lawrence patrolmen Charles Keenan and Walter Sliva after crashing a stolen car on Route 2 in Ayer, Massachusetts. Initially charged with auto theft, Nassar soon became a prominent suspect in the Kirmil murder. The police found two thirty-eight-caliber bullets in his pocket, and the nickel-plated revolver used in the murder in the wrecked car. Nassar and his friends Pullino and Kenney were indicted and pleaded guilty to a second degree murder charge. They were formally sentenced to life in prison.
Nassar was sent to the prison MCI-Norfolk in Norfolk, Massachusetts. Once there, Nassar formed a friendship with Unitarian minister William Moors and joined the Prison's Debating Society. Through the efforts of Moors, Nassar was paroled early in 1961. The Boston Strangler slayings would begin the following year.
Hilton's murder.
On September 29, 1964, Nassar brutally murdered 44-year-old Texaco station owner Irvin Hilton in full view of Rita Buote and her 14-year-old daughter Diane. As Buote pulled in to the station, Nassar fired one shot into the kneeling Hilton, and three more after he crumpled to the floor. Then he approached Buote's car, and tried to get her to open up. Failing, he jumped into another car and drove off toward North Andover. A truck driver, William King, wrote down the plate number and called the police.
The getaway car was found later that evening on a street in Andover next to Phillips Academy. The police soon learned that the car had been stolen earlier that day from near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. The car belonged to a navy lieutenant who was attending MIT. A thirty-two-caliber nickel-plated Harrington & Richardson revolver and a twenty-two caliber Astra semi-automatic pistol were found underneath the front seat of the car. Shells from the revolver were found at the crime scene and matched the bullets found in Hilton.
An autopsy on Hilton revealed that he had been shot six times at close range, and stabbed in the back. The police theorized that the murderer had made Hilton beg for his life while shooting him.
A description given by Rita and Diane Buote enabled Andover police officer William Tammany to draw a composite of the killer. On spotting the drawing, Nassar's former arresting officer Keenan was struck by its familiarity. He went through his files and came up with a photograph of Nassar, which the Buotes positively identified as the man they saw shooting Hilton.
Nassar was found living in the Mattapan section of Boston. The Andover, Lawrence, and state police contacted the Boston police department, and got a warrant at Dorchester District Court to search the suspect's car and his apartment on 51 Deering Road. When the police arrived, they found Nassar with a social worker. A hunting knife was also located and confiscated.
Nassar was subsequently arrested and sent to Bridgewater to await his trial. He was said to have schizophrenic tendencies and was put under observation when he met DeSalvo. On June 26, 1965, a jury found Nassar guilty of Hilton's murder, with no recommendation for mercy. He received the death sentence, and was placed on Death Row at Walpole State Prison pending appeal. On June 7, 1966, his sentence was struck down by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and later changed to life imprisonment.
Later life.
Nassar was convicted in 1967 of murder in the first degree and that conviction was upheld following plenary or de novo review. In 1982, Nassar filed an unsuccessful "pro se" motion for a new trial. When that motion was denied Nassar filed a one-sentence “motion for leave to appeal,” which was effectively abandoned.
Nassar and other Massachusetts prisoners were transferred to federal custody in the summer of 1980. Nassar and seven other prisoners successfully challenged the transfers in a 1981 civil suit. Because the prisoners did not receive reclassification hearings and other procedures mandated by Massachusetts law, they were returned to Massachusetts custody.
Nassar was being held in federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, as recently as 1983. Nassar is currently at Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Shirley.
After a twenty-year period, Nassar moved again for a new trial, which motion was denied. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in affirming the denial of the motion, wrote: “Nassar claimed in his motion that he was unable, in 1983, to show good cause not to dismiss the matter because at that time, he was incarcerated in the Federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, without access to Massachusetts legal materials. However, he was returned to Massachusetts in December, 1983, but did not seek to reopen the matter or inquire as to its status at that time, or at any time thereafter for over twenty years. We perceive no error or abuse of discretion in declining to reopen the proceedings after such a long period of inaction.” 
Nassar's appeal was denied by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on February 15, 2008.

Pennsylvania Route 910

Pennsylvania Route 910 (PA 910) is an east–west state highway in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area. It travels nineteen miles (30 km) between I-79 in Wexford and Freeport Road, former Pennsylvania Route 28 in Harmarville. 
Two portions of the Allegheny County Belt System routes run along PA 910:
Route description.
PA 910 begins at an interchange with I-79 on the border of Franklin Park and Marshall Township, heading east-northeast on three-lane undivided Wexford Bayne Road into Marshall Township, carrying two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane. At this point, the route is concurrent with the Orange Belt of the Allegheny County Belt System. The road passes a few businesses before narrowing to two lanes and running past residential subdivisions. PA 910 continues into Pine Township and comes to an interchange with US 19 in Wexford. At this point, the route becomes Wexford Road and heads east through forested areas. Farther east, the road passes through a mix of woods and residential development, entering Richland Township. In this area, PA 910 becomes Gibsonia Road and passes over I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) before heading through wooded areas of homes. The route passes through Gibsonia and crosses a Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad line, passing through more wooded residential areas as it comes to an intersection with PA 8 in a commercial area. 
Past this, the road turns southeast and runs near more housing subdivisions, crossing into West Deer Township and passing near businesses. At the intersection with Oak Road, the Orange Belt splits from PA 910 by heading east on that road, and PA 910 curves south. The route turns southeast and then south again, passing a mix of fields, woods, and homes. At the Cedar Ridge Road intersection, the Yellow Belt joins PA 910 for the remainder of the route and the road heads into Indiana Township, coming to another bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike). The road curves southeast through woods before passing through the residential community of Dorseyville. The route heads east and crosses over the Pennsylvania Turnpike again, making another turn to the southeast through wooded areas of development. PA 910 heads south and passes over the Pennsylvania Turnpike a fourth time, reaching the community of Indianola. The route continues southeast through wooded areas of residential and commercial development a short distance to the west of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, entering Harmar Township. The road becomes Indianola Road and passes through forests, becoming a three-lane road with two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane. PA 910 makes a sharp turn to the southwest and becomes a two-lane divided highway, coming to an interchange with the PA 28 freeway. At this point, the route widens into a four-lane divided highway and passes businesses, reaching its terminus at Freeport Road.

Gouverneur Street Ferry

The Gouverneur Street Ferry was a ferry route connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York City, United States, joining Gouverneur Street (Manhattan) and Bridge Street (Brooklyn) across the East River. 
History.
The ferry, originally the Walnut Street Ferry and later the Jackson Street Ferry or Hudson Avenue Ferry, was established on December 1, 1817, connecting Walnut Street (now Jackson Street) in Manhattan with Little Street (just east of Hudson Avenue, then Jackson Street) in Brooklyn. At some point, the Manhattan landing was moved to Gouverneur Street. Cyrus P. Smith and William F. Bulkley gained control by May 1852, and, effective May 23, 1853, the Brooklyn side was moved from Hudson Avenue to Bridge Street. Being unable to compete with the one-cent fare adopted by the Brooklyn Union Ferry Company in November 1850, it was sold to the new Union Ferry Company of Brooklyn (the successor to the Brooklyn Union) in December 1853. The lease expired on September 12, 1856, but the company continued to operate the ferry. They petitioned the City of New York to abandon the Roosevelt Street Ferry, in exchange for continuing Gouverneur Street operations and expanding the Manhattan landing. The city refused, and operations ended in January 1857.
A new ferry, known as the Navy Yard Ferry or Hudson Avenue Ferry, was established on July 8, 1859 between Jackson Street in Manhattan and Hudson Avenue in Brooklyn, almost exactly where the Gouverneur Street ferry started out in 1817. The Hudson Avenue Railroad opened a streetcar line from the ferry to Prospect Park in late 1867. The ferry shut down in early June 1868, leading the railroad to move its line to the Bridge Street Ferry.

Abraham Cronbach

Abraham Cronbach (February 15, 1882 – April 2, 1965) was an American Rabbi, teacher and known pacifist. He served as a rabbi for congregations in Indiana and Ohio. Cronbach was one of the founders of the Peace Heroes Memorial Society.
Personal life.
Rabbi Abraham Cronbach was born to German immigrants Marcus and Hannah (Itzig) Cronbach. Marcus Cronbach was a notions store retailer in Indianapolis, Indiana where Abraham Cronbach grew up. "Abraham was an introspective boy, with a precocious and mystic conception of both God and the devil (he thought the devil was responsible for the smoke from the manhole in the street)." He grew up in a Christian neighborhood where anti-Semitism and extreme poverty were common. He played violin as a boy as well as read a lot on religion and science. In high school Cronbach decided he would become a rabbi despite his parents' opposition.
Education.
Cronbach entered the Hebrew Union College (HUC) in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1898 where, in conjunction with the University of Cincinnati he studied for his bachelor's degree and trained for the rabbinate. He graduated in 1902 from the University of Cincinnati and, in 1906 was valedictorian of his HUC class and was ordained as a rabbi.
Marriage and children.
On October 7, 1917 Cronbach married Rose Hentel, a teacher at the Free Synagogue in New York whom he met during his time there. In 1923 the Cronbachs adopted a daughter, Marion. Later Rabbi Cronbach would become the teacher of rabbinic student, Maurice Davis who would become a leader in the anti-cult movement and Rabbi Cronbach's son-in-law. Their two children have followed in the footsteps of their father and grandfather. Cronbach's grandsons gave him six great-grandchildren. While Cronbach did not live to meet his great-grandchildren, his wife Rose lived to see the first of them, Talia Davis, the daughter of Rabbi JayR (Bahir) Davis.
Early career.
Abraham Cronbach first served as rabbi at the reform congregation of Temple Beth El in South Bend, Indiana. In 1911 he spent a year studying at the University of Cambridge in England and the Hochschule fur die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin. In 1915 he received the Doctor of Divinity degree from Hebrew Union College.
After resigning his pulpit in South Bend in 1915 Cronbach spent three years devoting himself to the chaplaincy in prison and hospital installations. He developed strong convictions about the futility of the prison system. He eventually befriended Nathan Leopold. His interest in prisoners never faded and only increased his detestation of revenge and retribution and made Cronbach a strong opponent of capital punishment and the entire prison system.
Cronbach spent the next seven years serving in three different rabbinical capacities: from 1915 and 1917 he worked with the Free Synagogue in New York City; from 1917 through 1919 he served as Rabbi at Temple Israel in Akron, Ohio; and from 1919 through 1922 he served as the institutional chaplain for the Chicago Federation of Synagogues.
Lecturer and educator.
In December 1920, Cronbach delivered a series of lectures on chaplaincy procedures at Hebrew Union College ("The Ministry of the Jewish By-Ways." Hebrew Union College Monthly, January - April, 1921). In 1922, Cronbach was appointed a professor of social studies at Hebrew Union College, where he remained for the rest of his life.
While teaching at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, Cronbach participated in Cincinnati's Jewish Fellowship House and the Cincinnati Big Brother's Association. He was also an active member of the Central Conference of American Rabbis and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now known as the Union for Reform Judaism).
In 1939 Cronbach became secretary to the Board of Editors of the "Hebrew Union College Annual".
Pacifism and life during the World Wars.
Early pacifist actions.
As a result of World War I, Cronbach became an ardent pacifist. He helped found the Peace Heroes Memorial Society in 1923. The Society's national headquarters were located in Cincinnati. Cronbach served as national secretary and was instrumental in establishing Memorial Day services around the country in honor of the heroes of industry, maternity, pacifism, etc. These services were an annual event in Cincinnati from 1923 through 1941.
Cronbach attempted to establish a specifically Jewish pacifist organization in 1924. A "Pledge for Jewish Pacifists" was sent out. Fifteen signed pledges were returned including ones from Max Heller and Jacob Weinstein however a formal organization never developed. Cronbach desisted from the project at the request of the College Board of Hebrew Union College who saw Cronbach as a public relations problem that was "too serious to be overlooked in the name of academic freedom."
Controversy during World War II.
With the threat and advent of World War II Cronbach's pacifist activities increased. Cronbach was familiar with controversy due to his pacifist beliefs. In 1935 he called for a conference between Nazis and Jews in Philadelphia for the purpose of reconciliation. During that same year he worked with the American Friends Service Committee to raise $5000 for an Austrian Relief Fund to aid persecuted Austrians, and German Jews and Nazis who had fled to Austria to escape Hitler's Germany.
Jewish Peace Fellowship.
In 1942 along with Rabbi Isidor Hoffman and Jane Evans, Cronbach established the Jewish Peace Fellowship, which caused a brief collision between Cronbach and the College Board of Hebrew Union College. The Jewish Peace Fellowship has had many prominent Jews as associates including Rabbi Leo Baeck, Albert Einstein, and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. For more than 50 years, Jewish Peace Fellowship has helped young Jewish conscientious objectors and is still active today. Cronbach has been quoted describing the fellowship as a
The impact of the Holocaust.
Throughout the Holocaust Cronbach felt the weight of the suffering of the German Jews; he wore a "yellow badge", the yellow Star of David, sewn by his wife. At the end of the war when Cronbach's friend Rabbi Leo Baeck returned after being imprisoned in a concentration camp he and Cronbach exchanged their yellow stars; the one Baeck had been forced to wear as a sign of oppression and the one Cronbach willingly wore in support of his suffering brethren. Baeck's yellow star now resides with Cronbach's two grandsons.
After the Allied victory of World War II Cronbach addressed letters to such Jewish organizations as the American Jewish Committee, American Jewish Conference, and the American Jewish Congress asking that they not seek punishment of Nazi war criminals.
Views on Zionism.
Cronbach was not dogmatic on the issue of Zionism but generally hued to the views instilled by his Classical Reform training, and remained consistent in opposing Israeli militarism. He became active with the American Council for Judaism and was a revered member of its leadership until his death.
Rosenbergs.
In 1952 Cronbach became a sponsor of the Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case and worked for the committee for the next two years. Cronbach carried on an active letter writing campaign that urged others to help secure clemency for the rosenbergs. "In May 1953, a Conference of Inquiry was held, sponsored by such people as Rabbi Abraham Cronbach and Mary Church Terrell on the national level."
On June 16, 1953 Rabbi Cronbach met with President Eisenhower to urge him to pardon the Rosenbergs. Cronbach compiled a book about his experience with the Rosenberg case.
Cronbach appeared with Julius Rosenberg's mother and the Rosenbergs two small sons at a protest meeting in front of the White House after the Rosenbergs had been found guilty. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed at Sing Sing prison in New York on June 19, 1953, more than two years after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage. Cronbach gave a eulogy at the Rosenberg's funeral on June 21, 1953. "Rabbi Cronbach's impassioned eulogy [...] is an eloquent statement against excessive punishment and in favor of the positive synergy existing between American patriotism and Judaism."
Rabbi Cronbach's eulogy for the Rosenbergs can be found in the Abraham Cronbach collection at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives.
Later life.
In 1950 Rabbi Cronbach retired from active teaching and became Emeritus Professor of Social Studies at Hebrew Union College. From then on he devoted most of his time to writing and published numerous articles and several books including "The Realities of Religion: A New Approach", "Stories Made of Bible Stories", "The Quest for Peace", and "The Bible and Our Social Outlook".
The Cronbach Chapel at the Leo Baeck School in Haifa, Israel was named in honor of Rabbi Cronbach by the National Federation of Temple Youth (now known as the North American Federation of Temple Youth or NFTY).
Rabbi Abraham Cronbach died in Cincinnati, Ohio. He is interred near his home in the Clifton neighborhood of Cincinnati. His wife was interred with him in 1982.

<doc id="9886337" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9886337" title="History of Maramureș">
History of Maramureș

Maramureș (in Romanian; Dacian: "Maramarista"; Latin: "Marmatia";; ) is a historical region in the north of Transylvania, along the upper Tisa River. The territory of the southern part of this region is now in the Maramureș County in northern Romania, whereas its northern section is included in the Zakarpattia Oblast of western Ukraine.
Prehistory.
There is evidence that the region of Maramureș was first settled in the Superior Paleolithic era. Archaeological discoveries of this primitive society have been uncovered in the Iza Valley near the village of Nănești.
Remnants from a Neolithic culture were discovered in many regions of Maramureș. Artifacts were found around Sighetu-Marmației, Costiui, Oncești, Cornești and Giulești. Some discoveries can be dated back to 6000 BC.
Traces of Mesolithic settlements, approximately 7000 years old, have been found near the villages of Camianitsa and Dibrova (Apșa de Jos) in Northern Maramureș and are considered among the oldest in Eastern Europe. Their inhabitants were hunter-gatherers, who lived during the winter in half-dug houses near the rivers and in the summer in aboveground huts. Using tools such as chisels, bows and arrows as well as harpoons, they worked stone and developed textured and glazed pottery and Ceramic. In a corner of their households they made clay kilns. The people of that period often moved their houses due to soil exhaustion. Cattle raising led to populating of mountain regions. The inhabitants of Maramureș from that period, together with those of nearby regions, belonged to the so-called Criş culture. Later, around 2000 BC, the migration of Indo-Europeans occurred. By the Bronze Age, the region of Maramureș was well settled, though due to the geography the population was quite sparse. Major archaeological discoveries have been found in more than twenty locations from the Bronze Age. This cultural establishment provides the first proof that the settlers of this region were of Geto-Dacian ancestry. During this time, the lands of Maramureș and much of modern Romania was the Kingdom of Dacia.
Antiquity.
In antiquity, the region was governed by Thracian tribes, also known as Geto-Dacians. Around 300 BC - 200 BC, the migration of Celts brought Central Europe a more advanced technological culture. The second largest metallurgic center in Europe was located near Maramureș, at Galish-Lovachka, near the present town of Mukachevo. Apart from silver coins, over a thousand metal tools have been found there, such as scissors for cutting sheep wool scythes or swords and the remains of jewel workshops. The migration of the Celts also had negative effects. It gradually led to hostility between the Celts and the local Geto-Dacians. At the beginning of the 1st century BC, the latter, under King Burebista, defeated the Celts, forcing them to retreat to the territory of today's Germany. The Dacians during that period built their houses on higher banks of rivers, remains of which still exist at "Cetatea" (near Ocna Slatina). The salt from this town was also very valuable during that period.
In 107, the Roman province of Dacia Superior was established, with an initial northern boundary along the Someș River, later to be moved further north. Maramureș became a region immediately adjacent to the Roman province. Roman coins have been found throughout the region, such as those at Nankovo (1000 Roman silver coins), Brestovo (25 golden coins), Ruske Pole and Gaidoshi. The salt mine at Ocna Slatina, the metallurgical center at Zatiseanski (Djacovo, Vovchanske), as well as the largest pottery district in Eastern Europe (on the river Mits) were all located in the region.
Although the Roman administration retreated after 168 years, the Roman influence remained, due to the now linguistically Roman and ethnically Daco-Roman locals, who had become Christian in 325 along with the Empire Dacia.
A great migration reached the region at the end of the 4th century, when Huns came to the Panonian plains. In the middle of the 5th century, the Huns formed a kingdom between the rivers Danube and Tisza under control of the legendary Attilla. In 453, Attilla was defeated by a Roman-Visigoth alliance under the Roman general Aetius and their kingdom disintegrated.
Early Middle Ages.
Different tribes, such as the Gepids, Vandals, Burgundians, Ostrogoths, Lombards and Slavs moved through the region of Maramureș. Of these, only the Slavs have left a deeper trace, due to their higher number. At the end of the 7th century, the whole region was under the Avar khanate. Today, the population of Maramureș is linguistically and ethnically Vlach, mostly Vlach shepherds. Before the coming of the Hungarians in 896, little is known regarding political control over the area.
The first groups of Slavs arrived nearby at the end of the 6th century, but they were not numerous. In the 8th century, however, a larger Slavic population followed. While some of the "Slavs-Croatians" soon migrated to the Balkan peninsula, those that remained populated the Pannonian territories immediately to the west of Maramureș. In the 9th century, the region bordered Velika Horvatia to the west and a small Slav dukedom, separating it from the much larger and stronger kingdom of Great Moravia. To the south, the region bordered the territory of Gelu, which was defeated in 904 by Hungarians. During this period, Slavs gradually converted to Christianity. In the 880s, disciples of Cyril and Methodius, expelled from Great Moravia, settled in the region immediately to the west of Maramureș and founded monasteries in inaccessible and beautiful mountain places.
In 896, the Hungarians arrived under their leader Álmos through the Verecke Pass (the valley of the river Latoritsa). In 903, under Arpad, they conquered the fortresses of Ungvár. In the 11th century, the Kingdom of Hungary extended its borders into Transylvania up to the crests of the Carpathian mountains. As with most border areas of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages, this territory was purposefully left mostly unsettled as a deterrent to invaders: the territory is mentioned in chronicles of the time as part of the "res nullis" (no-man's land) or "terra indagines" (uninhabited defensive border land).
The social organization of Maramureș during the Middle Ages was also very specific. The people in many mountain villages, where each family had a considerable domain, were called free peasants. In Romanian-speaking areas, these were called "nămeși " or free peasants. The Romanian term indicates belonging to a small clan, from the Romanian "neam (bigger old family)". This term has been preserved to this day, both in the areas that remained Romanian and in those which later gradually became Slavic. Hungarian and German terms also existed for similar circumstances in Hungarian and German-settled areas.
In the 12th century, King Géza II of Hungary invited Saxons (Germans) from the Rhine regions to settle there.
Between the 12th and 15th centuries, Maramureș and surrounding areas were the source of an emigration. The mountain areas of present-day Ukraine, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic have been partly colonized by migrating groups of Vlach (Romanian) shepherds from further south, continuing the great Vlach migration from Wallachia into Transylvania. They were gradually assimilated into the Slavic populations, but sometimes strongly influenced the local culture. In the southeastern corner of modern Poland, where ""lex vallachorum"" was in force as late as the 16th century, or eastern Moravia, where their autonomy was devastated by Wallenstein during the Thirty Years' War.
In March 1241, the Tatar-Mongols under the Khan Batu overwhelmed the mountain defenses and entered through the Verecke Pass (separating the county of Bereg from Galicia) to plunder Transylvania and the Kingdom of Hungary. They destroyed many towns and monasteries, killing up to half the population. Hungarian villages, being mostly in the valleys, bore the greatest brunt of the slaughter, and this helped start the decline in Hungarian population that influenced the modern political disposition of the territory. The Mongols destroyed the towns of Teceu (Técső then) and Ocna Slatina (Aknaszlatina then) as well as the surrounding villages. In 1242, they hastily retreated, after learning that the Great Khan had died, in order to back their leader Batu to become the new Great Khan.
1241-1526.
In 1245, the Hungarian king Béla IV invited grape-growers and wine-makers from Italy and Germany to settle in the places destroyed by the Tatars.
Like other border regions, portions of Maramureș became a settled part of the Kingdom of Hungary later than other areas. The depopulated border regions began to be settled, in this case by both Vlach and native Hungarians, well after the Mongol Invasion of Batu Khan (1241). It was designated a county in 1303, and its territory reached the crest of the Carpathian Mountains. Prior to this time, it had been described only as (uninhabited) "forest."
In the 13th century, the nearby counties of Ung, Bereg and Ugocsa were temporarily ceded to the Halic-Volyn Principality, but returned to Hungary in 1308 under the new Anjou dynasty. The three counts - Petk of Ung, Kopasz of Bereg and Moish of Ugocsa - opposed the return to Hungary and restoration of the local population to the Catholic Church. They plotted to install Iuri, the son of Prince Lev Danilovich of Halic and the grandson of Béla IV, as king of Hungary. But King Carol Robert of Anjou, with the help of the counts Drughezzi from Italy, prevailed.
Anjou's military and diplomatic tenacity was soon to be tested by Maramureș as well. In the middle of the 14th century, the nobility of Maramaros, while still jealously guarding their rights at home, were an important catalyst in uniting the lands to the east of the Carpathian mountains and forming the Moldavian Principality. Nobles from Maramaros lent large numbers of knights (called 'vitéz' in Hungarian) who were called and 'viteji' by the grateful Moldavians. This is the source of Moldavia's first and most famous dynasty, the Mușatins. One of the major participants in these events was the count of Maramaros Bogdan of Cuhea, who succeeded in 1342 and again in 1349, in totally eliminating the royal authority from Maramureș, only to find his efforts thwarted by the superior diplomatic ability of King Louis of Hungary over the lesser local (Romanian) nobility. In 1349, documents mentioning "Ioan, son of Iuga, voevod of Romanians from Maramureș" and "Nicolae, son of Petru", addressed to king Louis of Anjou regarding the rights of a certain "Giula, son of Darius" over the villages of Giulești and Nireş.
Bogdan's failure in Maramureș prompted him to remove his forces to Moldavia in June 1359. This left many of his villages with only defenseless peasants. In Moldavia, the arriving forces drove out Balc and Drag, grandsons of the legendary voevod Dragoș, loyal vassals of the king of Hungary. As "captains" of the easternmost "military mark", they had been organizing the defense against the Tatars on the eastern slopes of the Carpathians. When their reconciliation with Bogdan failed and the latter was able to gather sufficient support in Moldavia to gain independence both from Hungary and from Poland, Louis endowed Balc and Drag with the lands that Bogdan held in Maramureș and made them Voevods of the Vlachs, but this time vassals of the King. Documenting this in 1365, Louis ensured that the historic Kingdom of Hungary established its border along the crests of the Carpathians, a line preserved until the end of World War I.
For over 30 years, Balc and Drag developed Maramureș, opening it economically and culturally to the outside world. They were sole administrators of over 30 villages. Most of them were in the northern half of Maramureș including the towns of Hust and Sighet and the salt mine at Slatina (the mine has been productive since pre-Roman times). For the rest of the Voevodate/County (both names were used throughout their reign in the 14th century) lesser lords were their vassals or "nameși". Over the centuries, due mainly to wise diplomacy on the part of the Hungarian kings, Maramureș accepted its place as a county within the Kingdom of Hungary. The local nobility adopted the Hungarian language and intermarried with the Hungarian nobility from other regions of Transylvania, some of whom were actually of Romanian descent.
In 1215, two monks, "Romulus" and "Ghenadius", left the Monastery of Râmeț ("Little Rome") in the Alba district in south Transylvania to found the Monastery of the Saint Archangel Michael of Peri. In 1391, the orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople Antonius IV transformed this monastery into a Partiarchal Stavropighia with jurisdiction over eight counties: Maramureș, Ugocsa, Bereg, Ung, Árva, Ciceu, Sălaj and Bihorian Almaș. Different sources mention two different people as the first bishop - "Simon the Moldavian" by some and "ehumen Pahonius, a relative of the voevods" by others.
The bishopric became the earliest non-rural Romanian bishopric, after the bishoprics of Tomis and Durustorum, continued south of the Danube since Roman times. The monastery was the cultural and religious center of the northern half of Transylvania for over 300 years. Its monks produced the oldest known texts in the Romanian language (three different documents, apparently all written in 1391), as well as chronicles that served as sources for 17th and 18th century scholars of the Romanian renascence. In the 17th century, the monastery became an important typographic center. The monastery was burned down during an anti-Habsburg uprising of Hungarian Protestants in 1703, who retreated into the region and employed scorched earth tactics.
The village of Peri (Grushevo) is situated on the right bank of the river Tisza, in what is today Northern Maramuresh, between Apșa de Jos to the east, Teresva (also spelled Taras in older sources) to the west, Strâmtura to the north, all three currently in Ukraine and Săpânța, currently in Romania, to the south, on the opposite side of the river.
The oldest document mentioning Sighet, the capital of Maramureș, dates to 1326. In 1334, papal lists mention a "Benedict, paroh of Sighet." In 1346, Benedict is mentioned as "rector eclesie Zygeth". In 1329, King Carol Robert gave the status of seats of "royal guests" to four towns of Maramureș: Visk, Hust, Teceu and Campulung. On 19 February 1352, King Louis I extended these urban privileges to Sighet. In 1385, the city of Sighet is mentioned as "county siege, where documents are emitted", and in 1397, a document of the Dragoș family mentions "villa noastra libera ... Zyget". The towns of Hust and Teceu also gained in importance during that time. Masons, tailors, bakers, carpenters, barbers, potters, smiths, goldsmiths and cartwrighters are mentioned. In 1472, a diploma of Matei Corvin reaffirms the urban privileges of Sighet.
Many of the larger villages of Maramureș date from the same period: Slatina (1360), Apșa de Jos (1387), Apșa de Mijloc (1406) and Biserica Alba (1373). At the end of the 15th century, there were 128 towns and villages in Maramureș (compared with 205 in nearby Ung, 122 in Bereg and 76 in Ugocsa). The combined population in 1500 is estimated by historians at 30,000 to 60,000. Many villages are mentioned in the 15th century as nameși villages, i.e. inhabited by free peasants: Lipcia, Iza, Dolha, Dragova, Bedevlea, Vâșcova, Vilihivtsi, Criceva, Ciumaleva, Uglea, Colodne, Vonigova in the north Vâșcova is even mentioned as a town sometimes.
In 1514, the uprising of the cross-curutz peasants under Derdi Doji conquered Hust, the "gate of Maramureș", but did not encroach further into the region.
1526-1690.
In 1526, at the Battle of Mohács, Hungary was defeated by the Ottomans and King Lajos II, the last of the Jagiellon dynasty, died in battle. Most of the Pannonian plains were subsequently occupied by Turks and the western and northern Kingdom of Hungary passed to the Austrian Habsburgs, while Transylvania, including Maramureș, became an "autonomous principality" within the Ottoman Empire from 1541. Petru Rareș of Moldavia attempted to take the area over in 1527–1538 and later Mihai Viteazul of Wallachia tried the same in 1600-1601. Most notably, the Austrian Habsburgs tried it for the whole duration of the autonomous principality (1527) until they finally absorbed it in 1687. 
In 1551, Sighet's rights to hold fairs were reaffirmed. Also in 1551, the first ever strike in the Kingdom of Hungary took place, when the miners of Ocna Slatina left their workplace and created a makeshift tent camp at Baia Mare, demanding improvement of their working conditions and annulment of the death penalty.
In the 16th century, Lutheran and Reformed Calvinist movements took hold in Transylvania, especially among the Hungarian nobility. In 1556, the Catholic Church in Sighet, together with the majority of believers, was taken over by the Protestants. Later they also opened a confessional school there.
With the help of Transylvanian Saxons, a Romanian Orthodox monk from Moldavia "printed" the first Romanian language text entitled ""the Lutheran Catechism"" in 1544. During the 1550s and 1560s, a whole series of propaganda appeared. On November 30, 1566, the Protestant-dominated Sibiu Diet decided to ""extirpate the idolatry, especially from among the Romanian peasants"". During the reigns of the Zapolai princes in 1526–1571 over different parts of the disintegrating Kingdom of Hungary, the Protestant nobility of Transylvania and the Catholic Austria often clashed, with the latter slowly gaining the upper hand.
The pro-independence policy of the Hungarian-Transylvanian nobility provoked an Ottoman invasion in 1566. The principality was plundered, but its remote location saved Maramureș. The region was similarly protected from the devastations during and in the aftermath of the 1604–1606 and 1678–1685 Hungarian anti-Habsburg uprisings. The 16th and 17th centuries also saw the rise of haiduc movements - self-organized small detachments that attacked the rich and distributed the bounty among the poor.
From the 16th century, with the consent of the Hungarian nobility and later with that of the Habsburgs, the mountain regions separating Panonia from Galicia were subject to the "Galician colonization": Lemki settled in the Ung, Zempeln and Saros counties, Boiki - in Bereg and Ung, while Hutsuls - in northeastern Maramureș.
The period from the end of the 15th century to end of the 18th century also saw the gradual migration of Ruthenians from Bereg to the northwest of Maramureș, mostly by intermarriage with local Vlachs.
In 1611, Emperor Leopold of Austria allowed Sighet to have its own coat-of-arms: an Aurochs' head.
In the 17th century, the Romanian Orthodox Church of Transylvania was moved by the Diet to the jurisdiction of the Reformed (Calvinist) Church. A Calvinist "superintendent" was named on April 9, 1639 to oversee the conversion of Romanians from Orthodoxy to Calvinism. Many leaders of the Romanian Church (which opposed these moves) such as the metropolitans Dosoftei, Ghenadie II, Ilie Iorest and Sava Brâncovici (the latter two were later canonized by the Romanian Orthodox Church) were persecuted, imprisoned or sometimes killed by the Transylvanian governments of princes, such as Gabriel Bethlen or Georgy Rakoczi.
In 1641, the Ruthenian Orthodox Bishop of Munkach in Bereg, the region immediately to the west of Maramureș, converted to Catholicism. On April 24, 1646, 63 Ruthenian Orthodox clerics from nearby Ung, Bereg and Ugocsa counties proclaimed the Uzhhorod Union with Catholicism, founding the Ruthenian Greek-Catholic Church. In 1689, Pope Alexander VIII officially recognized the union. This led to open conflict with Báthory princes, who were Reformed Protestants. In 1689-1706, the Catholic Bishop of Munkach was a Greek, Iosif Camillis, who managed to take over some Orthodox parishes in northern Transylvania and obtained authority among others over some parts of Maramureș, especially over the largely Ruthenian villages of the region. In total, 140 Ruthenian and Romanian parishes were under the authority of the Bishop of Munkach. Later, in 1853, the Romanian ones separated and formed the Bishopric of Gherla.
The Romanian bishops of Maramureș, together with the monks of the Maramureș hermitages ("schituri"), trying to preserve orthodoxy, started a revival movement aimed at the local priests and at the population. Their aim was to uphold "that the language, traditions and religious we hold link us with neighboring Moldavia." To counterbalance the Catholic proselytism, the Romanian clergy of Maramureș elected Iosif Stoica from Criciova, a widowed priest who became a monk, then bishop. He was raised to this rank in 1690 by the metropolitan Dosoftei of Moldavia. An "antimis" (religious text), dated by Iosif Stoica in 1692 and preserved to this day, is signed ""din mila lui Dumnezeu, Episcop Ortodox al Maramureșului, exarh al Stavropighiei Patriarhale Constantinopolitane, locțiitor al Mitropoliei din Bâlgrad din Ardeal"", the title of the Bishopric of Peri. Stoica is known to have travelled throughout the region, often to Khust. The Hungarian historian Nicolae Bethlen, former chancellor of Transylvania during that period, has noted that Iosif Stoica wrote a letter opposing union with the Roman Church, based on arguments from the Scriptures and the writings of the Church fathers. Bethlen noted his surprise that a rural Romanian was able to produce "a letter of such theological strength."
After serving as bishop for 15 years, Iosif Stoica was forced to sign a 20-point program in 1705. It imposed strong restrictions to orthodoxy and to the Romanian character of the faith. However, when Iosif Stoica refused to sign, he was arrested and imprisoned in Khust, allegedly with the support of Iosif Camillis, who wanted to name as vicar of Sighet a Catholic, Gheorghe Ghenadie Bizanezi. The priests and parishioners of Maramureș protested in vain, demanding the release of their Bishop. They elected a new Bishop, Iov Țârca from Gâmbuţ, who after a few years of persecutions and accusations fled to Moldavia. He was then condemned to death for his activities in defending the Church. After being released in 1711, Iosif Stoica continued to exercise his episcopal functions without the knowledge of the authorities. He tried to recover his bishopric officially, but died in the same year. For his piety and activities in defending the traditional Romanian faith, he was revered by the believers from Maramureș along with the saints, and later, in 1992, the Romanian Orthodox Church canonized him. His saint's day is April 24.
The next bishop, Ștefan Serafim Petrovan, was a person easily swayed. He was ready to turn to Catholicism, but was prevented in this by the Calvinist Hungarian nobility. Romanian-Orthodox sources claim that the attempt to convert the Maramureș Romanians to Catholicism "were met with dignified and solemn protests against being united against their will and against introduction of innovations contradicting their old law and beliefs."
In the 17th century, Maramureș became renowned for the so-called "girl fairs" (""târguri de fete"") where, in addition to activities common to classical fairs, people gathered to meet and marry. Due to extensive cutting of woods, by 1631 the cutting of fir trees for cork to transport the salt was limited. At the same time, nuts, apples, mulberries, corn and clover became sources of revenue. Maramureș also became renowned for its wood and iron works - Visk, Criva, Buștina, Bocicoiu Mare, furnaces and casting - Kosivska Poliana, Butfalva, timber - Frăsini, Bocicoiu Mare, Gura Ciornei, shoe factories - Khust. Cliff caves were used to heat mineral water, creating the first spas. The towns of Visk, Teceu, Khust and others remained owned by the county government, unlike the surrounding regions, where many towns and cities became private property or central state property.
1690-1918.
The last incursion of the Ottomans into Central Europe proved disastrous to them. In 1683, the Austrians and the Poles defeated the Ottomans at the gates of Vienna. Within seven years, they also conquered Buda, Transylvania and abolished the principality. In 1699, in the Treaty of Karlovitz, the Ottomans officially renounced Transylvania in favour of Austria. In Transylvania, Catholic and Protestant efforts to convert the population resulted in open clashes. Concurrently, the Transylvanian nobility was becoming Magyarized, a process virtually completed by the 16th century, when Calvinism was adopted. After granting autonomy to Catholics Szeckely and new Lutherans Saxons, the nobility formed with them "The Union of The Three Nations", a statute aimed at concentrating all the power in the principality in the hands of the three nations: Hungarian (Calvinist nobles), (Catholic) Szeckelies and (Lutheran) Saxons. (Orthodox) Romanians, representing the vast majority of the population, were left with no representation, except the voice they could have through their clergy. Understanding that the religious pressure from all sides would not cease, a part of the Romanian-Orthodox clergy prepared to compromise with the side that would prove more flexible to the needs of the Romanians.
Linguistic and cultural affinities, as well as the much greater flexibility shown by the Catholic Church paid off for the latter. In 1692, Orthodox Bishop Teofil Seremi was established as the Metropolitan of Alba Iulia, as usual under the Calvin dependency. After discussions and negotiations through the Jesuit Ladislau Baranyi, Seremi convoked a synod. On March 21, 1697, the synod decided to unite the Church with Rome under the conditions of the Council of Florence, similarly to the unions of Brest and Muncach of the Ruthenians. The intention was that the Romanian clergy would receive the same rights and immunities as the Latin clergy, while preserving the traditional establishments and the mass. On April 4, 1697, the imperial chancellor Franz Ulrich Kinsky presented the Romanians' request to the governor of Transylvania Georgy Bánffy in Vienna and the imperial approval of the document. The Church was left under existing Calvinist control. Teofil Seremi died in July 1697, presumably by poisoning.
The ambiguity of the situation at the time was emphasized by the next Metropolitan of Transylvania, Atanasie Anghel. He received his ordination as Orthodox Metropolitan of Bucharest, where prince Constantin Brancoveanu of Wallachia had arranged for official instruction to be given to the new metropolitan by Dositei, the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem. As soon as the Catholics started to realize the promised concessions, the 1697 union gained strength. In response to the July 2, 1698 confirmation of the 1697 privileges by Cardinal Kollonich of Esztergom, Atanasie Anghel summoned a new synod, which passed a "Manifest of Union" on October 7, 1698, signed by 38 high representatives of the Romanian clergy of Transylvania. In 1700, Brancoveanu presented the Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan of Alba Iulia with a substantial financial contribution which he retracted the next year, after a new synod in 1700 validated the union. In 1701, Anghel travelled to Vienna and declared the Metropolitan province of Transylvania was no longer subordinate to Bucharest. Dositei, the Patriarch of Jerusalem and Teodosie, the Metropolitan of Bucharest, presented Anghel with a formal anathema.
In 1700, the Maramureș county congregation decided that the parochial school at Sighet had to be supported with public money.
In 1703, there was a Hungarian uprising against Austria and Catholicism, led by Ferenc Rakoczi. Some Romanians, Ruthenians and Slovaks participated. On June 7, 1703 the curutz won an inconclusive battle against Austrians at Dolha, but were subsequently defeated, although definitively only in 1711. During this uprising, the Hungarian Protestants plundered and destroyed the famous Monastery of Peri in 1703.
After the union, Anghel's difficulties continued. The Calvin "intendant" was replaced by a Jesuit "theologist", Gabriel Hevenessi, whose aggressiveness and absence of diplomacy, according to contemporaries, were surpassed only by his zeal to censure the books printed at Alba Iulia. The support from Wallachia was now completely cut. Due to the Hungarian revolt, the support from Vienna was minimal. In 1707, Rakoczy occupied Alba Iulia and Anghel had to retreat with the imperial troops to Sibiu. In Alba Iulia, the Bishop of Maramureș Iov Tarca, the former counter-candidate of Atanasie Anghel for the metropolitan see, re-established the Romanian Orthodox metropolitan province of Transylvania, with himself as Metropolitan, but was forced to flee to Maramureș, when the city passed again into Austrian hands.
In 1711, Atanasie Anghel, frustrated by the absence of imperial support, again voided the union with Rome, but was dissuaded by the Jesuits, when they finally managed to obtain support from the Emperor. Anghel died in 1713, but it took until December 23, 1715 until the Emperor approved another bishop, Ioan Giurgiu Patachi. Simultaneously, due to major reconstruction in Alba Iulia and resulting demolition of many old buildings, the metropolitan see was moved to Făgăraș. After approval by a papal decree ""Indulgentum esse"" (1716) and papal bull ""Rationi Congruit"" (1721), Patachi was festively installed in his position at the "St. Nicolas" Cathedral in Fagaraș on August 17, 1723.
In 1717, the Tatars invaded Maramureș and plundered the wealth of Sighet, much of which was hidden in the reformed church. After bringing much disaster, the Tatars were annihilated in a battle at Cavnic, where a monument was edicted to commemorate the battle. Also, commemorating the battle, a traditional costume is worn during the Christmas period, when the battle was fought, known today under the name of Brondosi.
The adversaries of the Greek-Catholic Church inside the imperial territory were the Protestant nobility of Transylvania, but also the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitan of Karlowitz. The latter's emissary to Transylvania, the Romanian monk Visarion Sarai, succeeded in spontaneously gathering so much support among the locals that it terrified the Austrian authorities. After arresting him, they sent him to the fearful Kufstein prison in Tirol, where he vanished.
The person who was instrumental in establishing the national right of Romanians in Transylvania and forming the union with Rome was the Romanian Greek-Catholic Bishop of Blaj Inocențiu Micu-Klein. Schooled by the Jesuits in Cluj, trained in theology in Trnava and later a Basilian monk, he was appointed in 1729 by Emperor Charles VI Bishop of Alba Iulia and Fagaraș. He was also awarded the titles of "Imperial Councillor" and Baron as well as given a seat in the Transylvanian Diet. In 1737, he moved the bishopric seat from Făgăraș to Blaj and in 1741 laid the foundations of the local cathedral. As a member of the Diet, Micu began to press the Habsburg monarchy to fulfill the agreement that conversion to Greek Catholicism would bring with it privileges such as were accorded Roman Catholics and an end to serfdom. First pressing for rights for the clergy and the converts, he soon began to petition for freedom for all Romanians. Micu petitioned the Habsburg court for over forty years to this end. His perseverance ultimately caused both Empress Maria Theresa and the Transylvanian Diet to declare themselves offended. The Diet itself opposed the liberation of the work force or the awarding of political rights to Romanians, considered by the Diet as "moth for the cloth." Exiled in 1744 and forced to give up his bishopric in 1751, Micu died in Rome in 1768.
A visit by the Catholic Bishop Manuil Olsavszky of Muncach, travelling as official envoy of Empress Maria Theresa throughout Transylvania, revealed that the union was in name only and that the locals did not want to receive uniate priests, but demanded that Klein be brought back. Fearing the situation could get much worse, Maria Theresa produced an Edict of Tolerance towards the Orthodox believers on July 13, 1759. It forbade the uniate clergy to persecute them. Two petitions were sent in March 1791 and March 1792 by the leaders of the ethnic Romanians of Transylvania to Emperor Leopold II, demanding equal political rights with the other ethnicities of Transylvania and a share of the Transylvanian Diet proportional to their population (two third). Partially modelled on revolutionary France Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the Supplex Libellus Valachorum Transsilvaniae (Petition of the Vlachs of Transylvania) documents were drafted by clerics of the Romanians Greek Catholic Church. Rejected, except for the point referring to the free practice of the Orthodox faith, despite the quasi-total support by the population, the document became the rallying point of the Romanians of Transylvania until after World War I.
In the 18th century, Maramureș was known for the export of salt, fur, wine and wooden crafts, while importing jewelry, carpets (from Turkey and the Balkans), fabric, crystal, china (from Czechia, Germany and Italy) and iron crafts (from Holland and Poland). Buștina, Veliky Bicichiv, Vâșcova, Teceu, Hust, Rahau, Ocna Slatina, Taras, Yasinia, Dolha, Borșa and Sighet were the regional towns that emerged during that period. Hust was hosting as many as ten annual fairs.
The 19th century brought economic growth to Maramureș, although the first factories had appeared two centuries earlier. Electricity, post and telephone service reached the region by the end of the century.
During 1870-1913, there was considerable migration to the USA. From Maramureș, Ugocea, Bereg and Ung combined, there were 180,000 legal and up to 400,000 illegal emigrants to the USA. A smaller number of people emigrated to Uruguay, Canada, Argentina and Australia.
In 1900, Ioan Mihalyi de Apșa printed the first volume of the history of the County of Maramureș, ""Maramureș Diplomas of XIV – XV centuries"", at Sighet.
With the beginning of World War I, Russian troops invaded Yasinea and Rahiv in northeastern Maramureș in September 1914. They were repelled, but at the end of October 1914, while pushing towrds Uzhoc, they invaded also the northest-most villages of Maramureș, around Studene and were again repelled. No further military action took place in Maramureș.
November 1918 - March 1919.
At the end of World War I, the Austria-Hungary empire dissolved. The nations comprising it elected national and/or regional assemblies to determine future political configurations. At this time, Maramureș County was divided into North and South. The National Assembly of the Romanians of (inner) Transylvania, Crișana, Banat and Maramureș, composed of 1228 elected members, has decided on December 1, 1918 in Alba Iulia upon their union with Romania.
On December 15, 1918, in Mediaș, the Council of the Transylvanian Saxons and Danubian Swabians (ethnic Germans that had moved to Transylvania in the 12th-13th, respectively in the 18th centuries) decided to support the Romanians, mainly because of their adversity to the prospect of otherwise living in a Hungarian national state, which was due to the Magyarization policy practiced in the Transleitanian part of Austria-Hungary after 1870 and until World War I. The remaining Hungarians (24%-26% of population of Transylvania) as a whole were opposed to this move, claiming to be represented by the Transleitanian Government in Budapest.
Southern Maramureș, as well as Romanian villages from the north of the river Tisza, around the town of Ocna Slatina, elected deputies to the Romanian Assembly.
In November and December 1918, various "Councils" were established in different cities of Carpathian Ruthenia, the region inhabited by Ruthenians, spanning over most parts of the former counties of Ung, Bereg, Ugocea and the northern part of Maramureș, in order for inhabitants to decide which state they wished to join.
Uzhhorod, Mukachevo, Berehovo and other cities voted to join the new Hungarian Republic. On January 21, 1919, Khust and Svaljava voted to join "Ukraine-Russia". A Hutsul Republic was declared in Yasinia on January 8, 1919. A vote was taken by the "National Council of American Ruthenians", in which Czechoslovakia won as the most popular home for the region. This vote served as a basis point for Entante's proposals about the future fate of Carpathian Ruthenia.
The Czechoslovak delegation at Versailles insisted that the northern half of Maramureș be combined with Carpathian Ruthenia, based on the fact that the August 17, 1916 Treaty (article 4) between Romania and the powers of the Entante (Britain, France, Russia and Italy) precluding the entrance of Romania in World War I, stipulated Romania's right to Austria-Hungarian territory inhabited by Romanians up to the river Tisza. The Romanian delegation was opposed to this because the river Tisza divided Maramureș County roughly into half and the Romanians from the right bank of Tisza also took part in the election of representatives to the Assembly of Alba Iulia.
These MPs voiced concern during the Assembly upon the incorrect usage of the phrase "up to Tisza" by some speakers as a figure of speech and were assured that de jure the Assembly was representing the population of the administrative units of Austria-Hungary from whom they were elected.
After tough negotiations at the Conference of the Treaty of Versailles, the Romanian delegation obtained that the Entente powers accept the decision of the Assembly. The Romanian Army moved into Transylvania during the spring and summer of 1919. They were welcomed by the local population, except by the ethnic Hungarians and to the deception of many of the politicians at the Conference of Versailles, trying to prevent the emergence of a regional power in Eastern Europe. Four independent field Commissions, one each from Britain, France, USA and Italy, submitted proposals for the border of Romania in Transylvania. The consolidated proposal suggested that the westernmost one row of Counties (parts of Crișana/Partium) be retained by Hungary and one County in the southwest (part of Banat) to be attributed to the newly formed Yugoslavia.
March 1919 - April 1920.
An ambiguous period ensued from March to May 1919 as a "Diet" government for Carpathian Ruthenia formed with strong ties to Hungary's Béla Kun (communist) regime.
Throughout the summer of 1919, Czech troops began to control most of what is today Carpathian Ruthenia, with Romanian troops gaining control of its southern regions in late spring at the request of the Versailles Conference, against the Communist Hungarian Republic.
In June 1919, independently from the ongoing events in Versailles, the Romanian and Czechoslovak armies agreed on a demarcation line which left Ung and most of the Bereg County under Czechoslovak control, while Maramureș, Ugocsa and part of the Bereg County fell under Romanian control, until the final decisions at Versailles were made.
On July 2, 1919, the Prime Minister of Romania, I C Brătianu, withdrew from the Versailles Conference because the Entente powers wanted to stick to the letter of the 1916 treaty with respect to Maramureș, i.e. to divide the county. This created tension between the Romanian Delegation and the Supreme Council at Versailles.
On August 3, 1919, the Entente powers finally accepted the Czechoslovak suggestion. Brătianu refused to sign the treaty in that form. The Romanians wanted to preserve the June demarcation line as the official border.
In Transylvania, there was some public anxiety about keeping Maramureș County intact. The Prefect of Maramureș, who kept the administration over the entire County, was very outspoken. Maramureș and Ugocsa elected members to the new Romanian parliament in 1919, with a wide participation in the vote among both Romanians and Ruthenians. The elected MPs were of both ethnic groups. They engaged in a series of attempts to wake the political class and the public opinion to what they called "the cause of the over-Tisza lands."
The Saint-Germain agreement of September 10, 1919 between Entente and Czechoslovakia provided for the incorporation of the majority of Carpathian Ruthenia into Slovakia as an autonomous unit of the Slovak portion of the Czechoslovak state.
In Romania, the Brătianu Government resigned on September 12, 1919 and a new government led by Vaitoianu was formed. A member of that government, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, previously a famous Transylvanian politician in former Austria-Hungary, compiled a documented "proposition about the boundary of Maramureș, to include all Romanian villages", suggesting "a line that would start west of Teceu and would continue to the north along mountain crests to the Galician border, leaving in Romania in addition to the south, the entire subdistrict of Sighet, the subdistricts of Tisza and Taras and half of the subdistrict of Teceu."
On September 30, 1919, Vaiatoianu was replaced by Vaida himself. Vaida was appointed to the Romanian Delegation in Versailles as an expert in the question of Maramureș by one of the new MPs from that County, Dr G Iuga. The latter presented many documents in support of the argument about "the obvious Romanian rights over Maramureș." He used the example of the oldest Romanian Bishopric, established in the village of Peri in 1391, on the northern side of the river, which has been for over 300 years the main center of Romanian culture in the northern half of Transylvania.
On December 1, 1919, the Romanian Parliament formed a new Vaida Government as a result of the parliamentary elections in Romania. Vaida had been Austro-Hungarian politician and as a result the relations between the Czech and the Romanian delegations in Versailles eased and the Conference took a more favorable view towards Romania.
On December 16, 1919, in a speech to the Romanian Parliament, Vaida said that he was hopeful in finding a solution "to save the entire Maramureș." After negotiations, the Czech Delegation started accepting the Romanian point of view. On March 15, 1920, the chief of the Czech Delegation to Versailles, Štefan Osuský, informed Vaida that the Maramureș border "is to be settled in short time." The agreement reached by the Romanian and Czech delegations left the entire Maramureș, except the Dolha sub-district, to Romania. In return, the Czechs demanded a military alliance. The agreement was to be signed in London, where the whole conference moved.
Yet another government was formed in Bucharest, this time not led by a Transylvanian, but by General Averescu. The agricultural reform envisioned by Vaida-Voevod deeply upset and threatened the wealthiest land owners and businessmen from pre-1918 Romania, who set aside their infighting to concentrate on the threat posed by Vaida. Of the 16 million inhabitants of Romania in 1920, only seven million lived in the pre-1918 territories. This threatened the pre-1918 political class, which was more feudal, conservative and anti-democratic than the politicians that formerly lived in Austria-Hungary or in the Russian Empire. Another faction that played a key role in the deposition of Vaida was Bratianu, who feared possible inquiries about the misuse of funds by his government before Romania entered World War I in 1916. Averescu assured Bratianu that any possible inquiries would be persecuted.
The Czechoslovak delegation took this opportunity to change its tone and refused to sign the documents on the grounds that the new Romanian government was not legitimate and could not sign agreements as the previous regime had.
On April 1, 1920, the Czech representative in Bucharest reaffirmed the Czechoslovak government's request that the Romanian troops leave the territory up to the Tisza line, informing the Romanian government that it "agrees to negotiate in the future a rectification of the boundary following propositions from a mixed Czech-Romanian border Commission to be formed."
On April 18, 1920, the Romanian Government of General Averescu announced to the Czechs that the army would retreat to the requested line. This reply, implemented at the end of July 1920, created the impression in diplomatic circles that Romanians renounced the territory of Maramureș north of the river Tisza. The Romanian perspective had been given a crushing blow with this hasty withdrawal of troops, a blow against the natural geographic configuration and vital economic interests of the region, without any consent and against the categorical will of the affected Romanian population. On June 4, 1920, Romania signed the Treaty of Trianon and the international community recognized the border in northern Transylvania as it is today. The mixed Czech-Romanian commission was never formed.
1920-1938.
After the Treaty of Trianon was concluded in 1920, Northern Maramureș became part of Subcarpathian Rus region of Slovakia, one of the component states of Czechoslovakia.
In 1920, there were 60 newspapers edited in the Subcarpathian Rus, the region that apart from northern Maramureș also contained Ung, Bereg and Ugocsa: 22 in Hungarian, ten in Russian, nine in Rusyn, five in Hebrew, four in Czech, four in Ukrainian and six mixed. No newspaper was published in Romanian.
1938-1944.
Prior and during World War II, Hungary, led by Miklós Horthy, allied itself with Nazi Germany in the hope of re-obtaining some of the territories it had lost under the Treaty of Trianon.
On October 1, 1938 the First Vienna Award came into force. It was a direct result of the Munich Agreement. Czechoslovakia was forced by Germany and Italy to cede the Sudetenland (a part of Czechia mostly inhabited by ethnic Germans) to the Third Reich. On October 6 and October 8, 1938, Slovakia and Subcarpathian-Ruthenia respectively gained autonomy. Then, Germany and Italy arbitrated the 2 November Vienna Protocol, allocating a strip of territory from southern Slovakia (approximately one third of Slovakia) and Subcarpathian-Ruthenia to Hungary. The resumption of Hungarian control over these territories was not an entirely peaceful process. Invited by Germany and Italy, Poland invaded and annexed the Teschen area in Moravia. Nevertheless, Romania refused to invade and annex the compactly Romanian part of Northern Maramureș. The remaining Slovak territory became officially autonomous and had the right to its own parliament and government with Monsignor Jozef Tiso chosen as its leader. However, it did not become fully independent from Czechoslovakia until an ultimatum given by Hitler prompted a vote for "independence" (as a puppet state for Hitler) on March 14, 1939.
The next day, on March 15, 1939, Germany annexed the remainder of Czechoslovakia as the "Reichsprotektorat" of Bohemia and Moravia. Subcarpathian-Ruthenia declared its independence in Khust under President Augustin Voloshin, but was invaded and annexed by Hungary the following day. On March 23, Hungary started an invasion from the Subcarpathian-Ruthenia and occupied additional portions of eastern Slovakia, but later returned them to Slovakia.
The Subcarpathian-Ruthenian land allocated to Hungary as part of the Vienna Protocol (November 2, 1938) Award included the region's largest cities: Uzhhorod, Mukachevo, Berehovo and Chop. Khust, in the East, the westernmost city of Northern Maramureș, remained a part of Subcarpathia-Ruthenia and the seat of its government moved there. The Chust government actively continued to voice complaints over the fate of the western Subcarpathian-Ruthenian territories and vocally asserted the region's case for its own government and the protection of its former lands. The Chust declarations increasingly included a possible attachment to an independent Ukraine. The day after the Slovak vote for independence from Czechoslovakia on March 14, 1939, the Ruthenian Diet led by Premier Augustin Voloshin declared independence for Subcarpathian-Ruthenian under the name "Carpatho-Ukraine." Within 24 hours, Hungarian troops invaded Chust with the assent of Hitler. They liquidated the government and annexed the remainder of Subcarpathian-Ruthenian to Hungary. In addition, the southern part of the Maramureș region was occupied by Hungary between 1940–1944 after the Second Vienna Award during World War II.
1944-1991.
At the end on 1944, the war touched Northern Maramureș. On October 18, 1944, Russian troops occupied the villages of Biserica Alba, Apsa de Mijloc and Ocna Slatina and on October 19 Apsa de Jos. On October 23, they created "people's committees" in these villages and on November 26, 1944, a "Congress of people's committees" was held in Mukachevo. It was to adopt a "Manifest of Union of Transcarpathia with the Soviet Ukraine." Someone using the name I.M. Lemaninet purported to represent Apsa de Jos at this Congress, although a person with this name has never been known before or after in the village. However, the official union of Subcarpathian-Ruthenian/Trans-Carpathia with the USSR was formalized in Moscow on June 29, 1945. After that, the Soviet Army organized the "election" of "presidents of people's committees." These were N.I. Guzo in Apsa de Mijloc, V.T. Popsa in Biserica Alba, Gh. Guban in Slatina and M.M. Filip in Apsa de Jos.
One of the first acts of the Soviet administration was to change the historic names of the villages. "Apsa de Jos" became "Dibrova", "Apsa de Mijloc" became "Srednee Vodianoe", "Ocna Slatina" became "Solotvino" and "Biserica Alba" became"Bila Tserkva". The names of the smaller villages were also changed.
Collectivization brought a lot of resistance from the local population. After the creation of the first kolkhoz in the village of Apsa de Jos, the biggest village of the Trans-Carpathian region, the locals killed Ivan Chernichko, the president of the kolkhoz. As a result, 21 men were sentenced to a total of 427 years of imprisonment. In Apsa de Mijloc, the locals killed four Soviet officials and were deported to Siberia. Eventually two kolkhoz were created in Apsa de Jos in 1949 and united three years later. In 1959, the kolkhoz of the village of Stramtura was united with the former, which was named "friendship of peoples."
Although the Soviets opened the first university in Uzhhorod, built the first hydro-electric plant (on the Tereblea and Rica rivers), partially electrified the railroad and even held the World Children Olympic Games in Uzhhorod in 1990, severe damage was produced during this period to the cultural and ecological heritage of the whole region of Trans-Carpathia, including Northern Maramureș.
1991–present.
At the fall of the USSR in 1991, Ukraine became independent. Trans-Carpathia has since then been an administrative region (oblast).

<doc id="9886454" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9886454" title="Transactive memory">
Transactive memory

Transactive memory is a psychological hypothesis first proposed by Daniel Wegner in 1985 as a response to earlier theories of "group mind" such as groupthink. A transactive memory system is a mechanism through which groups collectively encode, store, and retrieve knowledge. Transactive memory was initially studied in couples and families where individuals had close relationships but was later extended to teams, larger groups, and organizations to explain how they develop a "group mind", a memory system that is more complex and potentially more effective than that of any of its individual constituents. A transactive memory system is the interactions between memory within the individuals as well as the processes that update this memory. Transactive memory, on the other hand, is merely the shared store of knowledge.
According to Wegner, a transactive memory system consists of the knowledge stored in each individual's memory combined with metamemory containing information regarding the different teammate's domains of expertise. Just as an individual's metamemory allows him to be aware of what information is available for retrieval, so does the transactive memory system provide teammates with information regarding the knowledge they have access to within the group. Group members learn who knowledge experts are and how to access expertise through communicative processes. In this way, a transactive memory system can provide the group members with more and better knowledge than any individual could access on his own.
History.
Transactive memory was first envisioned by Daniel Wegner in 1985. This concept proposed that when two individuals spend a lot of time around each other and working together, they create a shared store of knowledge between the members. In essence, one member of the couple could store information within their partner and then recall that information by asking their partner about it. This concept was different and unique from other descriptions of socially distributed cognition in that it describes a situation where individuals hold different knowledge compared to shared information, and members of the group engage in transactions to assist in recall of the stored information. In a recent review, Ren and Argote described transactive memory as existing of both a structural component (the linkages of individual memory to the collective) and transactive processes that make the transactve memory dynamic. Wegner first proposed these three processes which occur in groups that lead to the formation and reification of transactive memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval described more below. In a series of experiments, Hollingshead found that romantic partners (who are assumed to have transactive memory) performed better on knowledge recall than dyads and that couples will memorize more words in a list than two strangers when they are rewarded on number of unique words you recall. The explanation for these findings are that couples know how best to remind each other of the knowledge they have, and that couples have a good conception of the other’s knowledge and will therefore avoid memorizing words within their partner’s domain. Strangers don’t have access to this same shared information which leads to poorer performance in these kinds of tasks. Transactive memory was further extended by Diane Liang and colleagues into the realm of work groups. In this work, the development of transactive memory was conceived of as a way to improve group’s performance when engaging in interdependent tasks. After this extension, transactive memory became more prolific in organizational behavior among other disciplines.
Transactive processes for the development of transactive memory systems.
Just like human memory, the development of a transactive memory system involves three stages: encoding, storage and retrieval. These processes are transactive, meaning that they are updated as members exchange information with one another.
Encoding.
In the "encoding" stage, the teammates gain information on the other team members domains of knowledge and categorize it by ascribing each knowledge domain to the corresponding team member. Sometimes, this acquaintance emerge through "who did what" conversation.
The encoding process is very important in the development of transactive memory. Encoding occurs through interaction between teammates: through sharing knowledge and seeking information from other team members teammates learn on the expertise of each team member as a first essential step towards specialization.
Storage.
In the "storage" stage, the relevant information is stored in the possession of the team member owning the corresponding expertise; once the experts have been identified, new information is transmitted directly to the relevant team member, a process which improves the learning process and reduces the load on the memory of the individual teammate.
Retrieval.
During the "retrieval" stage, a group member uses the developed transactive memory to identify a group member that specializes in the required knowledge area and then turns to that member to attain the knowledge. If this information is accurate and useful, the linkage to the member with specialized knowledge is strengthened. If the information is not accurate, then the encoding stage is entered into again such that information about the inaccuracy of the knowledge the specialized member provided is re-encoded and stored in the transactive memory system.
Development of transactive memory.
Much research has shown that a transactive memory system is primarily developed through interactions between team members. Training on the task that a group is expected to do together has been shown to assist in the development of a transactive memory system. In this study, when the group members were trained together, the team developed a stronger transactive memory system, recalled more information about the process, and made fewer errors compared to teams where individuals had gone through the same training but separately. The researchers concluded that the interactions that took place during the joint training allowed the team members to develop an understanding of their teammates' skills, assisted their search for relevant information about the task from their teammates, and assess the accuracy and reliability of this information. As a result, groups that trained together performed better in the task. In a later study, these same researchers also determined that familiarity with their teammates or liking didn't explain the differences between groups that were trained together and those that were not. In this study, the researchers gave the groups that didn't train together a team building exercise but they still did not do as well as the trained together group.
At the first stage in a group's life cycle, knowing each of the team members' expertise allows the group to distribute work in a more efficient way and allocate different assignments to team members that are the most qualified for these assignments. The existence of many interactions in the early stages of group formation provides each of the teammates the opportunity to get to know other team members' training, level of expertise or the lack of knowledge in certain areas, and develop a shared understanding of the task's requirements and the way that the total of the teammates knowledge combines together.
Hence, it seems that communication serves as a crucial component in the development of transactive memory. Yet, it seems that not any kind of communication and interaction between team members will bring to the construction of transactive memory. Communication, in general serves as a way of transferring information from one person to another, but for the purpose of transactive memory construction this communication must deal with information regarding the knowledge, expertise and relevant experience of other individuals in the system.
Moreland & Myaskovsky (2000) showed that transactive memory can be developed without any interaction between teammates. As a substitute to teammates' communication they provided group members feedback ranking team members' skills in the relevant task domains before they started performing the task. Although the feedback and the information regarding teammates knowledge was provided by the researchers and teammates did not communicate with each other beforehand, this information positively affected the team's transactive memory score and performance. This experiment demonstrated that the sharing specific information regarding team members' knowledge and domains of expertise formation is necessary for transactive memory development, either through direct interaction or by another means of information transformation.
Indicators of transactive memory.
Many researchers consider the basic components of transactive memory system to be specialization, coordination and credibility. This is a common misconception of how transactive memory systems operate within groups. These indicators of TMS occur after a group has established a transactive memory system and are due to the existence of transactive memory within the group. Because these three factors occur more prevalently in groups that have developed a TMS, they are often measured as a proxy for measuring the exact transactive memory system. The most prevalent measure of transactive memory as developed by Kyle Lewis measures these three components as indicators that a group has developed a transactive memory. Other measures, namely Austin’s attempts to measure the perceptions of expertise within the group as a more direct measure of transactive memory.
Specialization.
A strong transactive memory system is achieved when the group gains information about the knowledge repertoire that all other teammates hold and use this information in order to acquire different complementary knowledge. Once members within the group have a good understanding of who knows what within the group, they can begin to differentiate in their knowledge. This differentiation of knowledge is where the real benefit of a transactive memory system is enacted because, with less overlap in member’s areas of expertise, distribution of labor becomes easier and the group can become more efficient (Wegner 1987). When each team member can deepen his knowledge in any areas that are lacking (as opposed to acquiring congruent knowledge) they will enlarge the teams' total collective knowledge. Hollingshead (1998a) demonstrated that specialization lead to a more efficient and organized effort investment in information retrieval, prevention of information redundancy and supplied accessibility to larger range of expertise.
Coordination.
Coordination refers to the extent of necessity in explicit revealed planning and coordinating efforts during teamwork. When a group possesses a strong transactive memory system, the need for explicit coordination efforts reduces since teammates are aware of other teammates strengths and weaknesses, can anticipate their behavior and responds, and make quick adjustments of their own behavior in return. In groups that have developed a transactive memory, members are able to easily coordinate with one another and can go directly to those with expertise if they need their information.
Credibility.
'Credibility' reflects the extent to which the team members believe that the relevant task knowledge possessed by any of the other team members is correct and accurate. When groups that developed a transactive memory system, they will have gone through the encoding, storing, retrieval process several times for information. As new information is brought to the group’s attention it can be evaluated and then reencoded into the transactive memory system. If a member’s area of expertise has been used several times without issue, then other group members will begin to see the group member’s knowledge as more credible (wegner 1987). If a group has a well-developed transactive memory system, all members within the group would be seen as credible.
Transactive memory and team performance.
The existence of a transactive memory system within a group allows for quick access to a large amount of knowledge, improving information integration processes, improving decision making processes, influencing the perception of efficiency of other teammates, and increasing their satisfaction and sense of identification with the team and the organization. Transactive memory is composed of specialized knowledge and understanding of who has that knowledge, but benefits are not limited to just groups that engage in a lot of knowledge work.
Transactive memory may enhance performance through three major mechanisms:
• Division of the responsibility on different kinds of knowledge across the teammates allows each one of them to broaden his own knowledge in a specific area while maintaining access to relevant required task knowledge possessed by others.
• Developing transactive memory system will shorten the time needed for seeking the appropriate knowledge: when each team member knows who to turn to for the required information, less time is wasted in search for relevant task knowledge.
• The shared understanding of the teammates regarding the interpersonal relations in the team and the different expertise domains, enables them to better predict and anticipate how their team colleagues would behave, leading to well coordinated and efficient interactions.
Transactive memory may not be helpful for all kinds of groups or all kinds of work. Lewis and Herndon (2011) suggested criteria for kinds of tasks that a developed transactive memory system will be the most helpful in improving the performance of.
For these reasons, groups performing tasks that can't be broken apart or require little specialization may not get much benefit out of the development of a transactive memory system. The authors suggest that tasks where ideas have to be executed and all members have the same goal will benefit the most from a transactive memory system. Conversely the authors suggest that groups that engage in brainstorming or decision tasks may develop transactive memory systems faster than those merely executing ideas because there is more knowledge sharing and interaction between members.
Extensions to other domains.
When transactive memory was first envisioned, the authors were describing an external memory store within other people. They did acknowledge that we often store information within objects such as notebooks, books, or other recordings. These objects are static and transactive processes cannot occur. These objects, therefore, cannot cue memories within individuals in the same way another person could. The Internet, however, is much more dynamic than a book and individuals can engage in similar transactive processes as they would with other individuals. Research published in the journal "Science" on 14 July 2011 suggests that when people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information, but higher rates of recall of the sources of the information. The authors suggest that this research demonstrates that individuals are developing a transactive memory system with the Internet, relying on it for information instead of internalizing it within their own memories. To explain how external memory stores are related to transactive memory systems, Schakel (2013) described them as external artifacts which may either (be used to) influence or represent the ostensive or performative aspects of transactive memory systems.

Kopala

Kopala () is a traditional hero or demigod revered in the highlands of Pshavi in Georgia. It is said that he once was in a boulder-throwing contest against a number of "devebi", or ogres, to see who could throw a boulder the farthest. The ogres' champion picked up a boulder and hurled it across the valley to the mountain on the other side of the Aragvi river. K'op'ala tested a boulder, but decided it was too light. So he picked up another boulder, pressed it against the first, and threw them both across the valley. These nearly failed to surpass the ogre's throw, but at the crucial moment the god K'viria struck the boulder with his whip, causing it to fly further than the ogre's boulder, and it landed on top of the ogres' fortress of Tsikhetgori. As a result of their defeat in an ensuing battle which K'op'ala fought with his companion Iakhsari, the surviving ogres retreated underground allowing mankind to settle in the area unmolested.

He returned to football in 1942 and was traded to Richmond and made his senior debut that year. In 1945 he won the first of his three Best and Fairest awards, the others coming in 1948 and 1950.
Morris won the Brownlow Medalist in 1948, joining Stan Judkins as the only Richmond player to win the Medal at that time. He polled well in other Brownlow Medal nights, finishing equal second in 1946 and equal third in 1950. He was a regular Victorian interstate representative, playing a total of 15 games and captaining the state in 1950. He was also captain of Richmond, leading the club in 1950 and 1951.
At the end of the 1951 season Morris left Richmond and joined VFA Club Box Hill as captain-coach. He captain-coached Box Hill from 1952 to 1954, winning the Club's Best and Fairest each season. He played 58 games for Box Hill and scored 101 goals.
Morris's story is perhaps the most tragic of all Brownlow Medallists; in 1960 he committed suicide at the age of 38.
In 2002 Morris was inducted into the Richmond Hall of Fame and he is also a member of their official 'Team of the Century', being named in the forward pocket. He is also a member of Box Hill's official 'Greatest Ever Team' as announced in 2000, selected as first ruck.
On 1 June 2009, Morris was inducted to the AFL Hall of Fame.

<doc id="9886546" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9886546" title="New South Wales Coal Compensation Board">
New South Wales Coal Compensation Board

The New South Wales Coal Compensation Board was a government body in New South Wales which had responsibility for determining compensation payable when coal in the state was compulsorily acquired in 1981.
Background.
In 1981 the New South Wales Government passed legislation which vested all unmined coal to the crown. The effect of the "Coal Acquisition Act 1981" (NSW) was that the government became the owner of all unmined coal in the state. This enabled the government to tax the mining of coal, a situation it was not allowed to do when coal was privately owned.
According to the board’s annual report, the net benefit to the State from the acquisition of private coal is estimated at $10 billion after taking into account compensation payments totalling $682 million.
The board and the New South Wales Coal Compensation Review Tribunal were established in1985 to address concerns by former coal owners through the introduction of the act. Both bodies are the result of recommendations of the Coal Compensation Taskforce Report. 
Constitution.
The board was established under the "Coal Acquisition (Compensation) Arrangements 1985" (NSW). Those arrangements are made by the Governor of New South Wales under the Coal Acquisition Act 1981 (NSW), a law which entitles the governor to determine what compensation should be payable for the acquisition of coal in 1981.
The governor may appoint five part-time members to the board. This is on the recommendation of the minister responsible for mineral resources. One member has to be an employee of the Department of Mines. 
The governor may appoint one of the members to be the chairperson of the board.
Jurisdiction.
The board has jurisdiction to determine whether compensation is payable as a result of the compulsory acquisition of coal. It may also determine the amount of compensation payable as a result of that acquisition. 
The board also has jurisdiction to determine whether there should be restitution of coal owner to a private owner, and it may also deal with the voluntary acquisi5ion of coal titles.
According to the board’s Annual Report, it received compensation claims between July 1985 and March 1986, and between December 1993 and July 1994 totaling some 28,261 claims.
The New South Wales government flagged that it wished for all compensation claims to be determined by March 2007.
Appeals.
A person unhappy with the decision of the board may appeal to the New South Wales Coal Compensation Tribunal. 
In certain cases, prerogative relief may be available from the Supreme Court of New South Wales. See for example NSW Coal Compensation Board v Nardell Colliery Pty Ltd NSWCA 35. 
Chairperson.
The final chairperson was Mr Alastair Fotheringham, who was appointed on 1 November 1999 and reappointed on 29 October 2003.

Wynn Las Vegas.
The tall marquee features a high, wide, concave, double-faced LED message center with a first-of-its-kind “moving eraser.” Conceived by Steve Wynn, the massive eraser glides silently and smoothly up and down over the LED message center, appearing to change the graphics as it goes. The eraser weighs 62,000 pounds, and is counterbalanced by a 62,000-pound weight inside the sign.
The sign uses 4,377,600 LEDs and the eraser is powered by a motor at its base that runs a gear and cable system. The firm of FTSI engineered the 62,000-pound eraser’s movement, which is capable of speeds up to .The company has been instrumental in supporting the Neon Museum, which is dedicated to preserving the neon signs and associated artifacts of Las Vegas.

David Cook (game designer)

David "Zeb" Cook is an American game designer best known for his work at TSR, Inc., where he was employed for over fifteen years.
Early life.
Cook was born in East Lansing, Michigan, and grew up on a farm in Iowa where his father worked as a farmer and a college professor. In junior high school, Cook played wargames such as Avalon Hill's "Blitzkrieg" and "Afrika Korps": "I was primarily a wargamer, but there wasn't any role-playing available then," although in college, he was introduced to the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game through the University of Iowa gaming club.
Cook earned his B.A. in English (with a Theater minor) in 1977. He married his high school sweetheart, Helen, with whom he had one son, Ian. Cook became a high school teacher in Milligan, Nebraska, where his students gave him his nickname of "Zeb"; the name derives from his signature, which is dominated by a stroke resembling a 'Z', as well as his resemblance to the James Arness character Zeb Macahan in the TV series "How the West Was Won."
Career.
Cook responded to an ad in "Dragon" magazine for a game designer position at TSR. After completing the designer test that the company then used, and writing a sample module section, Cook became the third full-time game designer hired by TSR. Lawrence Schick was head of design and development at the time, and brought Cook on board during a time of substantial growth at TSR. Cook later became Senior Designer. "Game designing is hard work," he says, "but everything worth doing is hard work. The important thing is to do it well, and to have fun while you're doing it." Cook created role-playing games, modules, family board games, card games, rulebooks, and party mystery games.
He created the "Partyzone" mystery game line, and "The Spy Ring" scenario - the first "Partyzone" game - was named one of the Top 100 Games of 1985 by "Games" Magazine. Other notable works for TSR include the "Conan the Barbarian", "The Adventures of Indiana Jones", and "Star Frontiers" role-playing games, and the "Sirocco" and "Escape from New York" games. Cook also wrote several influential early adventure modules for D&D and AD&D, such as "A1: Slave Pits of the Undercity", "I1: Dwellers of the Forbidden City", "X1: The Isle of Dread", and "X4: Master of the Desert Nomads" and "X5: Temple of Death" (the 'Desert Nomads' series). Other module work included "CM4: Earthshaker!", "AC5: Dragon Tiles II", "AC2: D&D Game Combat Shield", "B6: The Veiled Society", "CB1: Conan Unchained!", "M1: Blizzard Pass" for "D&D" and "AD&D", and "Top Secret" module "TS005: Orient Express" and "Boot Hill" module "BH2: Lost Conquistador Mine".
After Tom Moldvay wrote the second edition of the "D&D" "Basic Set" (1980), Cook developed the "Expert Set" to take characters beyond third level. Cook was the primary author of the original "Oriental Adventures", ostensibly under the guidance and direction of Gary Gygax, which amongst other things introduced the concept of non-weapon proficiencies into AD&D, and designed the far eastern setting, Kara-Tur. Cook, with Jim Ward, Steve Winter, and Mike Breault, co-wrote the adventure scenario that was adapted into the game "Pool of Radiance". Cook was the lead designer on the 2nd edition of "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game. In "Dragon" #118 (February 1987), Cook wrote a column titled "Who Dies?" in which he discussed which character classes may be thrown out in the revision, with the intention of provoking a response from readers. Cook was also the lead designer on the "Planescape" campaign setting. When TSR was looking to replace Spelljammer after the setting ended, Slade Henson suggested a new campaign setting could be built on the first-edition "Manual of the Planes"; after the idea sat dormant for a year, Cook picked it up and invented Planescape as a result. One reviewer described "Planescape" as "the finest game world ever produced for "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons"".
Cook left TSR in 1994 to work in the field of electronic media. He was the lead designer on the 2005 "City of Villains" computer game for Cryptic Studios. After he left Cryptic, he joined Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment as the lead systems designer for the video game "Stargate Worlds". In 2001 he was inducted into the Origins Hall of Fame.
Cook works as Content Designer at ZeniMax Online Studios on the The Elder Scrolls Online.

<doc id="9886640" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9886640" title="Koh Thonsáy">
Koh Thonsáy

Koh Thonsáy () is a Cambodian island located off the south western coast of Cambodia. "Koh Thonsáy" means Rabbit Island, and it is located close to the mainland of Kep City.
Koh Tonsay is located 4.6 km south of Kep and can be reached by boat from Kep port. Tourists are drawn to the beautiful white sand beach overlooking the sea. The sea here is shallow and the sea bottom has a long gradual slope, making Koh Thonsay excellent for swimming. At the sea bottom are a variety of corals, sea animals and plants which attract researchers and ecologists.
Koh Thonsay is 2 square kilometers in area. During Norodom Sihanouk’s Sangkum Reastr Niyum regime, it was used as a place to rehabilitate criminals, who were also used to defend the island. Horse cart paths and wooden, thatch roofed motels were also constructed during this time. Most of this infrastructure has been destroyed by weather and decades of war.
Today there are new bamboo guest houses on the main beach, visited by Cambodian and foreign tourists. In addition, fishermen and their families live on the island, occupying other beaches around the shoreline.
Etymology.
The name Koh Tonsáy is derived from the word Rumsay (រំសាយ). While trying to avoid the commander’s troops, Prince Sakor Reach grew hopeless because his troops were exhausted. He led his remaining troops across the sea to an island in front of Kep city, where the troops spread out. Accordingly, the island was called Koh Rumsay( កោះរំសាយ) and later grew into Koh Thonsay(កោះទន្សាយ), as it is known today.

Mexican Federal Highway 2

Federal Highway 2 "(Carretera Federal 2)" runs along the Mexico–United States border.
Route description.
The highway is divided into two discontinuous segments. The western segment begins in Tijuana, Baja California, and terminates at El Porvenir, Chihuahua, near Ciudad Juárez. The eastern segment begins at Ciudad Acuña, Coahuila, and continues to the Gulf of Mexico at Playa Lauro Villar, Tamaulipas, near Matamoros.
Between Tijuana and Mexicali in Baja California, and again between Reynosa and Matamoros in Tamaulipas, the route is bypassed by Mexican Federal Highway 2D, a four lane controlled access toll road referred to in Mexico as an "autopista". It is advised that drivers use pesos when paying tolls as US dollars may be accepted at a rate disadvantageous to the driver. Highway 2 is considered to be part of Pacific Coastal Highway from Tijuana to Highway 15 in the State of Sonora.
The highway passes through the border states of Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas. The highway also has connecting access to every official port of entry into the United States with the exception of the international bridge between Ojinaga, Chihuahua, and Presidio, Texas, which is within the gap between the two highway segments. These ports of entry allow access from the highway to all four United States border states: California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. As a result, customs inspection stations are common along some sections of the highway.
Even if the highway were to be extended to join the two segments, the gap between the two is more directly crossed by traveling along Interstate 10 and U.S. Highway 90 in the United States because of the course of the Rio Grande (Río Bravo del Norte) around the Big Bend region of Texas.
Federal highways in Mexico are generally designated with even numbers for east-west routes and odd numbers for north-south routes. Numerical designations usually ascend southward away from the U.S. border for east-west routes, and usually ascend eastward away from the Pacific Ocean for north-south routes. Therefore, Federal Highway 2, due to its proximity to the border, has the lowest possible even number designation, and intersecting north-south federal routes conform to this pattern.
Major intersections.
Western segment.
The eastern terminus of this segment is in El Porvenir, Chihuahua.
Eastern segment.
The western terminus of this segment is in Ciudad Acuña, Coahuila
The eastern terminus of this segment is at Playa Lauro Villar on the Gulf of Mexico.

Dittsche

Dittsche: Das wirklich wahre Leben (The really true life) is a German improvisation comedy television show starring Olli Dittrich and Jon Flemming Olsen. 
Olli Dittrich plays the unemployed Dittsche, who frequents a local fast food diner and converses with the proprietor about current events, drawing heavily on bizarre tabloid headlines to formulate perplexingly insane theories about their background. Schildkröte (German word for Turtle), a bar regular (played by Franz Jarnach), looks on mostly passively in the background.
The show is unscripted and is broadcast live from a real fast food diner in Hamburg. One special feature of the show is the camera perspective, which changes in a fixed pattern and is digitally processed to mimic surveillance cameras. The show also features many celebrities from German TV and sports, who appear as customers of the diner.

The Draco Tavern

The Draco Tavern by Larry Niven is a 2006 collection of science fiction short stories concerning the activities of Rick Schumann, the bartender of the Draco Tavern.
Fictional background story.
The Draco tavern is located in Siberia, near the Mount Forel spaceport. The tavern was created after a race of sentient aliens called Chirpsithra landed on Earth. They stand 11 feet tall with salmon pink exoskeletons. All of them appear to be female. Their equivalent of alcohol's effect on humans is a mild electrical current. They originated on tidally locked planets around red dwarf suns. Eventually, they had control over every single red dwarf sun in the galaxy, or so they claim. They enjoy the company of other sentient beings, and are extremely intelligent. Units of currency used for Chirp-Human commerce are the "svith" and trade markers, mentioned in the story "Cruel and Unusual".
When they first put their mile-wide bubbleships into orbit around the Moon and landed in Siberia, they brought a host of aliens with a desire to eat, drink and socialize, thus the Draco Tavern was designed to cater to their individual, very diverse, and often conflicting interests.
Publication information.
Several of the Rick Schumann/Draco Tavern short stories which have appeared in other short story collections by Larry Niven were not reprinted in this book, thus it is not a Draco Tavern omnibus. The stories included in this anthology are mostly printed in the chronological order in which they were originally published.

Invariant factor

The invariant factors of a module over a principal ideal domain (PID) occur in one form of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain.
If formula_1 is a PID and formula_2 a finitely generated formula_1-module, then

William P. Bryant

William P. Bryant (1806 – 1860) was an American jurist from Kentucky. He served as the first Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court in the Oregon Territory. United States President James K. Polk appointed Bryant, of Indiana, to the court once the Oregon Territory was established in 1848. In Indiana he served in both houses of the Indiana General Assembly and was a county judge. Bryant also fought in the Black Hawk War against Native Americans.
Early life.
William Bryant was born on August 3, 1806, in Mercer County, Kentucky. He grew up there and left home at age 18 after his mother had died when he was young and could no longer tolerate his father’s religious upbringing. In 1825, Bryant moved to Rockville, Indiana, where he would fight in the Black Hawk War and begin practicing law. After the war he served in the Indiana House of Representatives from 1831 to 1836, followed by serving in the Indiana State Senate from 1836 until 1839.
Bryant started a law practice in 1840 with General T. A. Howard, and later served as a circuit court judge for Rockville. After changing political party affiliations from Whig to Democrat, he was appointed by United States President James K. Polk to serve as chief justice of the three member Oregon Supreme Court. Bryant was appointed on August 14, 1848, the same day the new Oregon Territory was created. He migrated to the territory in 1849, arriving April 9.
Oregon.
While in Oregon, Bryant purchased an island and milling operation from George Abernethy in the Willamette River called Abernethy’s Island. However, the island near Oregon City was previously claimed by Doctor John McLoughlin. Later this became an issue between McLoughlin and Samuel R. Thurston. Thurston had worked the Donation Land Claim Act in Congress to exclude McLoughlin’s claim to Oregon City and the island.
Oregon Supreme Court.
On August 14, 1848, Bryant was nominated by President Polk to be “chief justice of the supreme court of the United States for the Territory of Oregon” and was subsequently unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate. He held his first session of court on August 20, 1849 in Oregon City.
As the only federal judge in the territory, Bryant presided over the first criminal trial in what is now the state of Washington in 1849. At that time the Oregon Territory encompassed all of present states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming. On May 1, 1849, a group of roughly 100 Snoqualmie and Skewahamish tribesmen showed up at Fort Nisqually. Fort Nisqually at this time was a fur trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company. The Native Americans were not there to attack, but eventually an American named Leander Wallace was killed by the natives.
Following the murder, U.S. troops were deployed and demanded the tribes turn over the killers. Only after giving the tribe’s chief 80 blankets did they turn over anyone. These six Snoqualmies were charged with murder and Justice Bryant began the trial on October 1, 1849, at Fort Steilacoom after a grand jury returned indictments for all six. The outcome was that two, Kussus and Quallalwowt, were convicted of the murder and sentenced to hanging on October 2. On October 3, the two were hanged by U.S. Marshal Joseph L. Meek. The total cost of the trial was $2,379.54, which included the cost of the 80 blankets. Former judge of the Provisional Government of Oregon and later justice on the Oregon Supreme Court, Alonzo A. Skinner was brought with Bryant to serve as the prosecutor.
The next year Chief Justice Bryant resigned from the court. His resignation was effective January 1, 1851.
Later years.
After leaving the court Bryant returned east. He first moved to the nation’s capital in Washington, DC, before returning to Indiana and his hometown of Rockville. William Bryant died there on October 10, 1860.

History.
Upon moving up from Division II in 1981, Loyola was an original member of the ECAC Metro Conference which changed its name to the Northeast Conference (NEC) on August 1, 1988. During its eight seasons in the circuit, the Greyhounds never won the championship and had no appearances in either the NCAA or National Invitation Tournaments. The only player in the program's Division I history to have reached the National Basketball Association (NBA) is Mike Morrison, a four-year letterman from 1985 to 1989. An All-Conference First Team as a junior and senior, he was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the second round (51st overall) of the 1989 NBA Draft. He was eventually named to the NEC 25th Anniversary All-Time Team in January 2006. Mark Amatucci was also honored as the circuit's Jim Phelan Coach of the Year in 1983–84.
Loyola was a member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) from 1989 to 2013. The Greyhounds won the MAAC Championship to earn the automatic bid into the NCAA Tournament twice. The first time was in 1993–94 with an 80–75 win over Manhattan at Knickerbocker Arena and Tracy Bergan earning conference tournament Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. This was also Skip Prosser's only campaign as the program's head coach. The Greyhounds' next conference title came eighteen years later in 2012 with MVP Erik Etherly spearheading a 48–44 victory over Fairfield at MassMutual Center. Jimmy Patsos was the MAAC Coach of the Year that season. The MAAC era at Loyola ended with Patsos' departure to Siena on April 2, 2013.

<doc id="9886936" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9886936" title="Lost Adams Diggings">
Lost Adams Diggings

The Lost Adams Diggings is a Southwestern treasure story that refers to the existence of a canyon rich in gold deposits somewhere in western New Mexico in the early 1860s.
The Legend.
Adams, for whom the legend became known and whose first name forever has been lost to history, was journeying in his wagon from the state of New York to Tucson. After Apaches set his wagon on fire, Adams drove a dozen saved horses towards Sacaton, Arizona, with the hope to sell them. In Sacaton, Adams met a group of twenty one miners led by John Brewer traveling together in search of the gold fields. The party also accounted the Pima-Mexican guide who promised the prospectors to lead them to the valley of gold :“I know a place where canyon walls cry tears of every day! And those tears are larger than your coins!” Supposedly, In 1862, the young Pima-Mexican had gone on an expedition with the Apaches when those attacked Pueblo Indians in western New Mexico. While on the expedition he had seen gold nuggets that were larger than oak nuts. The young man had appreciation for works made out of silver and turquoise but had no knowledge of gold value. The miners made a bargain with the guide who only asked for a horse, a saddle, a weapon and some of the gold in exchange. The group was badly in need of horses, and when by fate Adams appeared in Sacaton with his twelve head, Brewer struck a deal with Adams on the terms that Adams would share leadership with him in exchange for donating his horses. 
Along with their guide the group followed White River and its east fork into the White Mountains and entered western New Mexico. The guide paused and pointed to two mountains that were shaped like sugar loaves. “The gold canyon lies at the foot of those peaks,” the guide said. According to Adams, from that mountain lookout the miners were able to observe San Francisco Mountains. Adams thought that this mountain range was located on Mt. Ord, or on one of the mountaintops nearby. The miners entered a canyon with a fantastic gold deposit through 'the Little Door', as Adams referred to it. He said that the passageway was so narrow that the riders had to enter it one by one. Within a few days the group collected a fortune of gold nuggets that they hid in a corn-grinding basin left by ancient Indians. The young guide left the miners on the second night after the discovery and after being paid. Before leaving the guide issued a warning. He told the group not to stay long in the canyon that was a campsite for Apaches. The miners continued to mine the gold until they ran out of supplies. The party decided to send Brewer and five others to buy more supplies at Old Fort Wingate, west of modern Grants. Nine days after the provisions party did not return, Adams became concerned about their safety. Along with another miner named Davidson, Adams climbed out of the canyon to discover five bodies on the trail, Brewer was not among them. They raced back towards camp, but it was too late. A large party of Indians had reached the camp and killed the remaining miners. Days later, Adams was found by a military patrol wandering in the wilderness and out of his mind. 
Upon recovery Adams settled in California and when the Apache Wars ended, he led several expeditions to find the canyon and the basin filled with gold. 
Adams must have had a terrible sense of direction, after so many years of searching his quest proved hopeless. But in his search he inspired others to joint the hunt.
Possible locations.
For decades the Zuni Mountains were considered the most plausible location of the diggings. Thousands of prospectors, ranch-hands, and men-of-fortune searched this area and the rest of southwestern New Mexico prior to WWII, as the Adams diggings became the most sought-for gold in the country. Only Frank Dobie's 1939 book "Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver" adequately describes how renowned the Adams legend had become. The combination of the depression and the deregulation of the gold market prompted the most unlikely people to search for the diggings. Between 1895 and 1930 several large logging communities flourished in the Zuni Mountains, several with schools and post offices; wide-gauge railroads crisscrossed the mountains. The loggers were well aware of the Adams legend, as it had become a nationally known story. Between running logs nothing was more common than prospecting except for drinking. Rumors of gold in the Zunis had become so common that the U.S. government ordered several geological expeditions in the years between WWI and WWII to verify whether this claim could be supported. The geologists found nothing. In the 1950s the area was thoroughly re-explored for uranium during the uranium boom around Grants, New Mexico. Eventually the obsession with the Zuni Mountains as a host for the Adams diggings faded. It was also around the mid-century that the popularity of the Adams legend began to diminish and the Lost Dutchman Mine became America's most sought-for lost gold mine. The Adams diggings were beginning to seem a hoax or a mine unlikely to ever be found.
Geologically, the Adams diggings could only be in the southwestern quadrant of the state. Adams himself spent most of the remainder of his life searching the areas in and around Reserve, New Mexico. This area was the largest gold producing area in the state, and hosted several small mining booms, including the rich strikes at Silver City and Pinos Altos. The areas that could conceivably host the diggings in this region (containing several large mountain ranges that remain sparsely inhabited) are numerous, as minerals and evidence of previous mining can be found throughout the area. Local folklore will tell you that the gold is at the headwaters of either the Black River, the Gila River, or the Prieto River. Spanish Lore will tell you to look to the Blue Mountains. Dozens of mining camps in this region of New Mexico were thought to be the Adams diggings for brief periods, until each proved itself to be less rich than at first indicated: egregious hopes followed by rapid disappointment. That seems to be the story of gold in the desert southwest. 
The Datils and Gallinas Mountains and the basins to the north of these mountains were considered possible locations for the diggings that increased in popularity as the other locations lost appeal. Dick French, in his book "Four Days from Fort Wingate", places the diggings in this area. It has become known as "Dick French’s area," although his location was known to have been found by others in the 1950s, if not earlier. No gold has been found there. 
A similar but geographically less plausible location was found in eastern Arizona by Don Fingado near Clifton. The site contains features described by Adams much like the area favored by Dick French; however, again, the gold remained undiscovered. 
In some minds the gold was to be found on either the Zuni or Navajo reservations, but the laws preventing the acquisition of mineral rights in these regions have discouraged searching. 
There are other sites, but the leading candidates in the popular imagination are mentioned above. If it really exists, its traditional location remains within "Apacheria" or the southwest quadrant of New Mexico and bordering areas in Arizona. The complexity of the story is detailed in Jack Purcell's definitive book on the subject, "The Lost Adams Diggings: Myth, Mystery, and Madness." This work, unlike its predecessors, is a serious attempt to give historical perspective supported by cited research. Purcell believes that the gold exists and is perhaps somewhere in the mountains just south of Quemado, New Mexico. Perhaps gold will be found someday, but in the minds of most, the legend is fading away among the other items in the forgotten annals of American lore.
Legacy.
The many stories arising or deriving from the lost diggings have inspired many to search for lost Apache gold ever since. Its legend has supplied many folk tales, stories and books with ample fuel for fantasies of lost treasures, hidden canyons, Apache secrets and gold "somewhere out there" in the wilds. Another supposed Indian name for the mine was "Sno-Ta-Hay," which supposedly means "there it lies" i.e. the gold is on the ground and can be picked up or panned as a placer mine. Chief Nana supposedly called it that when he first warned the Adams party before the attack. As previously mentioned, J. Frank Dobie devoted half of his book "Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver" (now in its ninth printing) to the story of the Lost Adams Diggings and considered it to be the greatest "lost mine" story of US history. The amount of mail being sent to western New Mexico during the 1930s prompted the government to create a new post office in the area affectionately named "Lost Adams Diggings, NM;" the post office has since closed. 
The 1963 novel "MacKenna's Gold" by Heck Allen is loosely based on the Adams legend. The novel was made into a film in 1969 with the title "Mackenna's Gold." Numerous other books about, or based on, the diggings have been written.

Nanolathe

Nanolathing is a fictional construction method used in the Real-time strategy (RTS) computer games "Total Annihilation", Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihilation, nanolathes are the systems used by construction units and structures to produce more units and structures.
With a traditional lathe, stock is spun in place while various tools are used to remove small amounts of material at a time until the desired shape is achieved. Nanolathe technology, quite similar to the real-life process of 3D printing, is the reverse of this. Working from a pre-defined blueprint in memory, a construction unit sprays down microscopic particles, layer upon layer, until the build is complete. Once the blueprint is established, other construction units may assist with building up the layers, even if they do not have the blueprint themselves.
Appearance in Supreme Commander.
The different factions in Supreme Commander all use nanolathes, but the methods differ somewhat.
UEF establish the blueprint by surrounding the area with blue-glowing field. The particles are then sprayed in place by beams. Cybran constructors release small, flying drones. The blueprint appears as a red-glowing structure, and the building takes place by the drones using red beams. Aeon create a vortex field from where the building rises. Seraphim create an energy vortex, where the energy converts into matter at a fast rate and the structure expands until completed.

Gotland Blue

Blå Gotland (, ) is a cheese that was made in Sweden by the Arla Foods company in the town of Stånga on the island of Gotland. This cheese is often characterized as being somewhere between strong and mild, containing elements of both types. The colour is a pale yellow, with no holes. It is similar to Emmentaler in texture, but has a flavor reminiscent of stronger cheeses. The cheese is cubed shaped and covered in a blue wax, thus making the cheese take on visual cues from the Swedish flag and national colours. Blå Gotland was sold in Sweden and in Germany.
The cheese is no longer made as the factory in Stånga shut down in 2004.

Alla Beknazarova

Alla Oleksandrivna Beknazarova (, , born 28 August 1984) is a Ukrainian former competitive ice dancer. She is a three-time Ukrainian national champion — in 2001 with Yuriy Kocherzhenko and in 2007 and 2008 with Vladimir Zuev. Her best ISU Championship result, fourth, came at the 2001 World Junior Championships, competing with Kocherzhenko.
Career.
Beknazarova teamed up with Yuriy Kocherzhenko in late 1999 or early 2000. They were sent to the 2000 World Junior Championships, held in March in Oberstdorf, and finished 18th. In the 2000–01 season, Beknazarova/Kocherzhenko won gold at two JGP events and qualified for the ISU Junior Grand Prix Final, where they placed fourth. They also finished fourth at the 2001 World Junior Championships in Sofia. They won one senior international medal, bronze at the 2001 Karl Schäfer Memorial, and competed at two senior Grand Prix events and two senior ISU Championships. Their partnership ended in 2003.

John Workman

John Workman (born June 20, 1950) is an editor, writer, artist, designer, colorist and letterer in the comic book industry. He is known for his frequent partnerships with writer/artist Walter Simonson and also for lettering the entire run of Grant Morrison/Rachel Pollack's "Doom Patrol" (DC Comics).
Born in Beckley, West Virginia, Workman spent the first eight years of his life in Glen Rogers, West Virginia and Darlington, Maryland. Inspired by the George Reeves "Superman" TV series, he began writing short stories and drawing pictures. Living in Aberdeen, Washington, he studied art and journalism at Grays Harbor College and Clark College, receiving an Associate in Arts degree from Grays Harbor in 1970.
Career.
Working in and around the Aberdeen area from 1967 to 1975, Workman created local and regional advertising, always attempting to do the ad work in comics form whenever he was allowed to do so. He also did comics fanzine work, writing and drawing for several different publications, including fanzines overseen by Rick Spanier ("Assorted Superlatives") and by Mark Wheatley. In 1968, he met gag cartoonist Carl Stamwitz who had worked for Marvel Comics in their humor magazines. He was further encouraged when he met and had numerous conversations with the legendary writer-artist Basil Wolverton in 1969.
He got his start in comics publishing on a national level in 1972 by writing and drawing two four-page comics features, "Sindy" and "The Fallen Angels," that appeared for three years in two California-based men's magazines published by "Archie Comics" alumnus Ed Goldstein. Using different pseudonyms (one being E. L. Bert), Workman also wrote short prose stories that appeared in the magazines alongside stories by Harlan Ellison and Robert Bloch. Two years later, in the pages of Mike Friedrich's "Star*Reach", he wrote, penciled, inked and lettered stories for the seminal fantasy/science fiction comics anthology. Workman's work on "Star*Reach" attracted attention from DC Comics, and they offered him a production job in 1975.
Workman was art director of "Heavy Metal" magazine from 1977 to 1984. His comics art, writing, lettering, coloring and design work are evident throughout issues from that period.
Lettering.
From 1977-1983, Workman lettered comics occasionally (mostly for DC); he has been working steadily as a freelance letterer since 1983. Some of the regular titles he has lettered include First Comics' "Grimjack" from 1984 to 1987, Marvel's "Fantastic Four" from 1985 to 1989, "Cosmic Odyssey" in 1988–1989, "Fantastic Force" from 1994–1996, "The Incredible Hulk" from 1997–1999, and "Spider-Girl" from 2000–2002.
For DC Comics, Workman lettered "Doom Patrol" from 1987–1995, the "Legion of Super-Heroes" from 1991–1993, "Michael Moorcock's Multiverse" in 1997–1998, and "Aquaman" in 1999–2000.
Workman handled lettering chores for Topps Comics' "X-Files" titles in the late 1990s, and Image Comics' "Savage Dragon" from 2003–2005. Since 2003, he has done a lot of lettering work for Archie Comics, especially for their Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man titles. He has created logos for many of their super-hero characters and has done interior lettering on both New Crusaders and The Fox.
Walt Simonson.
Workman has worked on many of Walt Simonson’s projects, including "Thor" (Marvel, 1983–1987), "Balder the Brave" (Marvel, 1985), "Jurassic Park" (Topps, 1993), "Robocop vs. Terminator", "Star Slammers" (Bravura/Malibu, 1994), and "Orion" (DC, 2000–2002).
Tommy Lee Edwards.
Recently Workman has lettered much of the Marvel, DC and Wildstorm work of Tommy Lee Edwards, including "Gemini Blood" (1996–1997), "The Question" (2005), "Bullet Points" (2007), "Turf" and "Marvel 1985" (2008) for which he won the 2009 Harvey Award for lettering.
Writing, artwork and design.
In addition to the thousands of comics pages that he has lettered, Workman has also written and/or drawn for DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Archie Comics, "National Lampoon", "Playboy", Hamilton Publishing, and others. He wrote an introduction and the final chapter in Bhob Stewart's "Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood" and contributed a short autobiographical piece in comics form to the TwoMorrows book "Streetwise". Working in an art style similar to that of artist Mike Sekowsky, he pencilled and inked three of the dust jackets for the hardcover DC Comics "Justice League Archives" series.
He wrote and drew the 41-page "Adventures of Roma" which ran in consecutive issues of "Dark Horse Presents" in 1987. Workman's early science-fiction and girlie-humor strips "Sindy" and "The Fallen Angels" were collected in a five-issue run by Forbidden Fruit, an imprint of Apple Comics. "Wild Things", a three-issue series published by Metro Comics, was made up mostly of material created by Workman for such diverse publications as "Star*Reach" and "Heavy Metal". In July of 2013, a reformatted graphic novel version of "The Adventures of Roma" with new art and additional story material was published in both hardbound and softcover editions by CO2 Comics.
For the Fantagraphics imprint Eros Comix, Workman wrote and designed "Betty Being Bad" (1990), a 48-page booklet about pin-up model Betty Page. He also wrote and designed two hardcovers for Heavy Metal Books, "Heavy Metal: 25 Years of Classic Covers" and "Innocent Images". A self-published booklet,"The Comic Book Crisis," which examined the business side of comic books was incorporated (with additional new material) into issue 199 of "The Comics Journal", featuring commentary by Mike Friedrich, Steve Geppi, Kurt Busiek, Gary Groth and others.
Through his own Neonarcheos Publishing imprint, Workman has published limited editions of "Writing, Penciling, Inking, Lettering, Editing Martelaine," "The Third Man," "The Art of John Workman," and both black-and-white and color posters of pages of his artwork.
Lettering style.
Workman is noted for his distinct lettering style, tight craftsmanship, and the fact that for the most part he still does traditional lettering on art boards instead of using the computer and digital fonts. One of Workman's lettering trademarks is to often erase or omit panel borders when they touch the top, side or bottom of a word balloon or caption, thus opening up the balloon/caption to the gutter. In this regard, Workman's lettering style is similar to that of the late Bill Oakley. Workman's lettering style was highly influenced by the lettering of Jean "Moebius" Giraud from the time when Moebius appeared regularly in the pages of "Heavy Metal".
Because he does most of his lettering by hand, Workman's collaboration is sought by those artists who wish to have a more cohesive and integrated look to the final artwork. (A joke in the comic book community goes that "Comic books are the only place where having 'Workmanlike' craftsmanship is a plus.")
Recently, however, even Workman has moved toward digital lettering. In addition to his "on-the-art boards work," Workman has been electronically hand-lettering by way of a Wacom tablet for such books as "Torchwood," "Mega Man", "Thor", "Turf," and DC's "Before Watchmen" series ""Ozymandias"."
Personal life.
Workman is married to the former Cathy Foster, whom he met at Aberdeen's Eaton's Bookstall when she was looking for issues of "Lois Lane" drawn by Kurt Schaffenberger, and the two have a daughter named Kate, a writer who is the author of two Sherlock Holmes novels. His brother Bill worked beside him on-staff at "Heavy Metal" magazine. Both were in the 2000 Jon Cryer film "Went to Coney Island on a Mission from God... Be Back by Five".

Laboratorija Zvuka

Laboratorija Zvuka (Serbian Cyrillic: Лабораторија Звука; trans. "Sound Laboratory"), sometimes credited as Laboratorija ("Laboratory") only, was a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock band. Noted for their eccentric style, erotic lyrics, unusual line ups and bizarre circus-inspired stage performances, Laboratorija Zvuka were one of the pioneers of the Serbian and former Yugoslav alternative rock scenes.
History.
1970s and 1980s.
The band's history begins in 1977, when brothers Predrag (an architect and former film critic, formerly a member of The Best of Nothing and Med) and Mladen Vranešević (a former Falkoni and Neoplanti member) decided to form a band. The brothers previously worked together on music for films, theatre plays, radio and TV shows. They started working together in 1971, when they wrote music for Karpo Godina's short film "Zdravi ljudi za razonodu" ("Healthy People for Recreation"), on the lyrics of poet and musician Branko Andrić. For the music they were awarded on on the Festival of Short and Documentary Film, which motivated them to continue composing, often receiving awards for their music in Yugoslavia and abroad. They wrote music for numerous films, including "The Medusa Raft", "Veštački raj" ("Artificial Paradise"), "Još ovaj put" ("One Last Time"), "Kraj rata" ("End of the War"), "Oktoberfest", "The Original of the Forgery", "Full Moon Over Belgrade", and numerous TV shows, including "Poletarac", "Priče iz Nepričave", "Fore i fazoni", "Čik pogodi ko sam", "Lutkomedija".
The band, named Laboratorija Zvuka, featured musicians with whom the Vranešević brothers previously worked in studio: Aleksandar Pejak (guitar), Stevan Lukić (guitar), Laslo Pihler (drums), Vera Lajko (vocals, keyboards), Dina Kurbatfinsky Vranešević (Mladen Vranešević's wife, vocals), Aleksandar "Caki" Kravić (bass guitar), and Olah Vince (violin). With the song "Dok vam je još vreme" ("While You Still Can") they appeared on the Opatija Festival. After the success of the single, they recorded their debut album. "Telo" ("The Body"), released through Jugoton in 1980, was a concept album, with the A-side entitled "Vrline" ("Virtues"), featuring the songs which celebrated asceticism and healthy lifestyle, and the B-side, entitled "Poroci" ("Vices"), featuring songs about bodily pleasures. The album opens with an acted transmission from the bodybuilding competition in Bački Jarak, and is followed by new wave-oriented (but also featuring elements of other genres) songs "Suvarak" ("Spall"), "Lepo telo" ("Pretty Body", featuring a quotation from Oliver Dragojević's song "Oprosti mi, pape"), "Alkohol, žene i..." ("Alcohol, Women And...", featuring a quotation from the Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"), "Bajna mašina" ("Fabulous Machine"), and other songs.
On the concerts the band performed in a thirteen-piece lineup, which, beside the band members, featured the female singer Renata Vigi, drummer Ivan Kašik, but also the world bodybuilding champion Petar Čelik and his wife Irena. While the band was playing, Čelik was practicing his bodybuilding using various training devices. In 1980 the band released the 7" single featuring their biggest hit, the ska song "Ska-kavac joj zaš'o u rukavac" ("Grasshopper Got in Her Branch"), which featured quotes from "Crven ban", a collection of erotic folk poetry compiled by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. The song also featured the debut appearance of the band's mascot, Vilmoš Kauboj ("Vilmoš the Cowboy"), real name Vilmoš Lakatoš, a marginal character from the streets of Novi Sad, who toured with the band as an announcer.
The band's following album, "Duboko u tebi" ("Deep inside You"), released through Jugoton in 1982, featured elements of rockabilly. The song "Zaboravljena draga" ("The Forgotten Beloved") was recorded for Zoran Amar's film "Piknik u Topoli" ("Picnic in Topola"), featuring lyrics written by Predrag Vranešević and Slobodan Tišma, the member of Luna, and a former member of La Strada. However, as Tišma did not want to be known that he worked on the song lyrics, he was signed on the album as Bobo Misteriozo. The album also featured a cover of Larry Williams' "Bony Moronie", and "Odlazim dolazim" ("I'm Leaving I'm Coming"), recorded live in 1978, on the band's performance on the Subotica Omladinski festival. At the time, the band's new members became Deže Molnar (saxophone), and Miroslav Cvetković "Pis" (guitar). In 1982, the band performed in Germany, on the concerts organized by KPZ of Vojvodina for the children of Yugoslav guest workers. During this staying in Germany, the band recorded the electronic music-oriented single with the songs "Devica 69" ("Virgin 69") i "Šetnja" ("A Walk").
In 1982, Predrag Vranešević, in the name of the band, was charged because the band "insulted socialist moral and hurt patriotic feelings" of the citizens of Novo Mesto, SR Slovenia. Some citizens of Novo Mesto saw a poster announcing Laboratorija Zvuka concert and thought that the image of Vilmoš Kauboj insults the image of the late president Josip Broz Tito. Predrag Vranešević was sentenced to 40 days in prison, but the whole case was soon hushed up as absurd and all charges were dropped.
In 1983 the band performed in Germany once again, and after a performance at the Zagreb Bienale Festival, which that year featured the bands Gang of Four and Classix Nouveaux, established contacts with English managers, and in August 1984 went to London, and during five evenings they performed in the Institute of Contemporary Arts, under the name La Boratoria. The happening, entitled "Jašući konje Svetog Marka" ("Riding Saint Mark's Horses"), featured an art exhibition and a theatre play about a hero named PVC, an illegitimate son of Sergei Yesenin and Isadora Duncan. On the scene appeared the members of the band, ballet dancers, and bodybuilder Slobodan Blagojević. The performance was well received in the British press. During their staying in London, the band recorded a short documentary, entitled "Kuda ide naše malo društvo" ("Where Is Our Small Society Heading To"), with a screenplay written by Predrag, and directed by Mladen Vranešević. At this time, Predrag Vranešević started working with young bands, and helped Plavi Orkestar and Ruž in their first steps.
In 1986 the band released the album "Nevinost" ("Innocence"), in the new lineup, which, beside Predrag Vranešević on keyboards, guitar and vocals, Deže Molnar on saxophone, and Mladen Vranešević, Renata Vigy, and Dina Kurbatfinsky Vranešević on vocals, featured a former Luna and Pekinška Patka member Zoran "Bale" Bulatović on guitar, a former Luna and Ekatarina Velika member Ivan Fece "Firchie" on drums, Stojan Jovanović on bass guitar, and Senad Jašarević on keyboards. The band's new mascot, beside Vilmoš Kauboj, became a woman named Dušica Ilić, known as Duško Ilić before her sex reassignment surgery, who became known as the clairvoyant under the name Kleopatra ("Cleopatra") in the 1990s. The album featured rereleased songs from 7" singles, "Ska-kavac joj zašo u rukavac", "Devica", "Šetnja", but also the notable tracks "Daj mi bugi, dam ti vugi" ("Give Me Boogie, I Give You Woogie"), "Mala moja, al' je paranoja" ("My Baby Is Paranoid"), "Vili, Vili" ("Willie, Willie").
1990s.
After a longer break in their work, the band, in 1996, released the album entitled in Serbian ijekavian, "Nema niđe te ljepote" ("There's No Such a Beauty"), through Komuna. The title track was recorded for the Tourism Association of Montenegro, and the others were written during the bands career, but never appeared on any of the band's releases. The album featured ten songs, recorded in a minimalist manner and resembling demo recordings. The songs were written by Vranešević brothers. The songs "Do I Dare" and "Vinyl Mirrors" were written on the poems of Johnatan Loyd, and the lyrics for the song "Mimi" were written after the motifs from Ivo Tijardović's works. The album was recorded by Vranešević brothers, Molnar, Bulatović, and the backing vocals were sung by Milana Vranešević, daughter of Mladen and Dina Vranešević's. After the album release, the band officially ended their activity.
Post-breakup.
In 1991, Predrag Vranešević became the TV Novi Sad musical editor. He retired in 2005. In 2011, in cooperation with film director Želimir Žilnik, he created the opera "Nema zemlja" ("Silent Land"). The opera was based on Vranešević's 1971 rock opera "Fabrike radnicima" ("Factories to the Workers").
Mladen Vranešević dedicated himself to marketing. He died on July 16, 2006.
Legacy.
In 2006, the song "Ska-kavac joj zaš'o u rukavac" was ranked No. 84 on the B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs list.

Giulia Warwick (1857 – July 13, 1904) was an English operatic soprano and actress, best known for roles in with Richard D'Oyly Carte's and the Carl Rosa Opera Company in the last quarter of the 19th century.
Life and career.
Born Julia Ehrenberg, her stage name came from her birthplace, Warwick Street, in Regent's Park, Camden, London. Her father was a Polish Jew, and she and her two sisters were all interested in music. Warwick originally intended to be a pianist, playing at the Hanover Rooms as early as 1869, when she was only 12 years old, and then at St. George's Hall in 1872. She then studied singing under Sainton Dolby and Maurice Garcia.

Chris Knight (musician)

Chris Knight (born June 24, 1960) is an American singer-songwriter from Slaughters, Kentucky. In addition to releasing solo records of his own material, Knight has had a successful career writing songs that have been recorded by Confederate Railroad, John Anderson, and Randy Travis among others.
Biography.
Early life.
Knight grew up in the small western Kentucky mining town of Slaughters, Kentucky. He grew up in the country, had a lot of cousins who all lived in the same area of Kentucky. Knight has three brothers and a sister. His father was a pipe liner. Knight said that both his grandfather and great grandfather were farmers who had big farms before the Depression, but that they just couldn't hang on to them.
When he was three years old, he asked for a plastic guitar for Christmas. At 15, he became serious and began teaching himself John Prine songs on his older brother's guitar.
Knight earned a degree in agriculture from Western Kentucky University. He worked for ten years as a mine reclamation inspector and as a miner's consultant for the Kentucky Department of Surface Mining.
Music career.
Knight started writing songs when he was 26, but didn't start performing until he was 30. He got his first record deal when he was 37.
Nashville.
In 1986, he heard Steve Earle on the radio and decided to start writing songs. After six years he came to Nashville and won a spot on a songwriters' night at the Bluebird Cafe.
He attracted the interest of music producer Frank Liddell, who signed him to a contract with Bluewater Music. When Decca Records hired Liddell for an A&R position, Knight received a contract and in 1998 Decca released his self-titled debut. Knight still lived in a 10'-x-15' trailer on in Slaughters when the album was released. Decca folded at the end of the 1990s, only two years after Knight joined the label. After a couple years without a label, Knight signed with Dualtone Music Group.
Knight licensed his music to Dualtone Records for two records, then decided to release his music independently with the help of his manager. Knight said that "after the two records we decided that we could do anything an independent label can do, so we kind of cut out the record company. We cut out the third party ‘cause we had access to everything – publicity, distribution, everything. There was really no reason to go on a smaller label whenever we could do it ourselves."
Texas.
Knight is well known in Texas for writing the hit Montgomery Gentry song "She Couldn't Change Me" and because of his particular fame in Texas, was named an "Honorary Texan" in 2006 by Texas Governor Rick Perry.
Early releases.
He recorded his first demo tapes, bootlegged—and then self-released—while living alone in a trailer on his property outside Slaughters. Called "The Trailer Tapes," and officially released in 2007. They were one of the best-selling records of Knight's career.
Like its predecessor, the twelve songs on Chris Knight's "Trailer II" were recorded in 1996 inside of his sweltering single-wide in a field just outside of Slaughters. "Trailer II" is far more than just a sequel to "The Trailer Tapes." The tapes were produced by producer/engineer Ray Kennedy (Steve Earle and Lucinda Williams).
Little Victories.
It took Knight four years to release "Little Victories" in 2012. Knight's former Decca labelmate, Lee Ann Womack, collaborated with him on "You Lie When You Call My Name." Long-time musical hero John Prine sings on the title track. Buddy Miller plays guitar and sings on two tracks: "Missing You" and "Nothing on Me."
Musical style.
Knight's music has been described as "four-minute novels, mainly about his native Kentucky upbringing and characters he knew." Knight said, "It was interesting to me, growing up in a rural area in a big family in a small town. So, I got a lot of inspiration."
About his hometown, where he still lives, Knight says in Slaughters "there is not a whole lot going on. There are five or six churches. They just closed the grade school down. There used to be a high school, but they shut it down this year. There is one little store. They’ve torn the downtown down. When I was kid, my mother bought our school clothes in downtown Slaughters, but there is really nothing there now. A post office, churches and about 200 people."
When asked to talk about the darkness of his work, Knight said: "I never thought my first album was dark. I don’t think any of them are that dark. I mean, people that like to read, I write songs like I would write books if I was a novelist. It’s never been something that is that big a deal to me to write a story song with something real happening in it, but everybody got off on all this dark business."

<doc id="9887603" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9887603" title="QBZ-03">
QBZ-03

The QBZ-03 assault rifle, also known as the Type 03, is a Chinese gas operated, selective-fire weapon and is the latest assault rifle designed and developed for the 5.8 x 42 mm DBP87 round.
Unlike the bullpup QBZ-95, the QBZ-03 is a weapon of conventional design and is loosely inspired by the Type 81 assault rifle. The weapon is designed to be easily used by soldiers already familiar with previously issued rifles and machine guns. The QBZ-03 has a two-piece receiver largely made up of forged aluminum alloy with the stock, pistol grip, and handguards being made of a polymer compound. The gas block has a two position regulator, one for firing standard ammunition, the other to allow the use of rifle grenades. The sights are of a hooded front sight with a flip up rear diopter sight similar to the American M16 rifle. A scope rail is available to allow the use of various optics. The QBZ-03 has seen some issue within the People's Armed Police, People's Liberation Army Marine Corps, People's Liberation Army Air Force Paratroopers, and second line PLA ground units. An export-aimed version of the QBZ-03 also exists, first introduced in 2005 by the joint CJAIE (China Jing-An Import-Export) and Jiang-She Group Companies. The export version is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and feeds by STANAG magazines. The cyclic rate on the issued model is semi-automatic or fully automatic only, while the export model has an integrated three round burst mode. The type's most notable public display was by the PLA Airforce Airborne Troops during the October 1st 2009 60th Anniversary Parade.
ZH-05.
In February 2011, photos began to appear of a Chinese weapon called the ZH-05. The ZH-05 combines the Type 03 assault rifle with a 20 mm airburst grenade launcher. This makes China the third country to develop an airburst infantry weapon, after the American XM29 Objective Individual Combat Weapon and XM25 CDTE and the South Korean K11 DAW. Unlike foreign airburst weapons, the ZH-05 has a single-shot grenade launcher that requires each round to be manually loaded and reloaded after every firing, while the others are magazine fed; this makes it lightest of all the airburst weapons. The primary weapon of the system is the 20 mm grenade launcher, with the 5.8 mm rifle for secondary use. Grenades are pre-programmed and loaded into a manually operated bolt-action. Three types of grenade rounds available are impact detonation, airburst, and shotgun-type rounds. The U.S. encountered problems with the lethality of small 20 mm grenades during OICW development, causing the switch to larger 25 mm grenades for the XM25. China claims their grenades have less electronics in them to carry more explosives and fragments to cause adequate wounding capability. The grenades are reportedly capable of a damage radius and an 800 meters range.
Upgrade.
A new tactical variant of the rifle was spotted at an Anti-Terrorism exhibition.

Gunnison Tunnel

The Gunnison Tunnel is a 5.8 mile (9.3 km) irrigation tunnel constructed between 1905 and 1909 by the Bureau of Reclamation. At the time of its completion, it was the longest irrigation tunnel in the world. The tunnel diverts water from the Gunnison River in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison to the arid Uncompahgre Valley around Montrose, Colorado.
The tunnel opened in 1909 to much fanfare and dedication ceremony attended by President William Howard Taft.

The Fatal Eggs

The Fatal Eggs (, ) is a science-fiction novella by Mikhail Bulgakov, a Soviet novelist and playwright whose most famous work is "The Master and Margarita". It was written in 1924 and first published in 1925. The book became quite popular, but was much criticised by some Soviet critics as a satire of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the leadership of Soviet Russia.
Background.
By 1924, Bulgakov was relatively well known as a writer. He had published several short stories, including "Dyavoliada", in some ways a precursor to "Master and Margarita", and started publishing his first novel, "The White Guard". "The Fatal Eggs" was finished in early October 1924 and published in the "Nedra" journal in February 1925; a shortened edition was also published in May–June 1925 in the "Krasnaya Panorama" journal, under the title "The Ray of Life" (Russian: "Луч жизни"). Bulgakov also read the novel on several occasions to various social gatherings, where it met with favorable reception.
Plot summary.
"The Fatal Eggs" can be described as a science fiction novel. Its main protagonist is an aging zoologist, Vladimir Ipat'evich Persikov, a specialist in amphibians. The narration begins in Moscow of 1928, which seems to have overcome the destructive effects of the Russian Civil War and is quite prosperous. After a long period of degradation, research at the Zoological Institute has revived. After leaving his microscope for several hours, Persikov suddenly noticed that the out-of-focus microscope produced a ray of red light; amoeba left under that light showed an impossibly increased rate of binary fission, reproducing at enormous speeds and demonstrating unusual aggression. Later experiments with large cameras — to produce a larger ray — confirmed that the same increased speed of reproduction applied to other organisms, such as frogs, which evolved and produced a next generation within two days. Persikov's invention quickly becomes known to journalists, and eventually to foreign spies and to the GPU, the Soviet secret service. At the same time, the country is affected by an unknown disease in domesticated poultry, which results in a complete extinction of all chickens in the Soviet Russia, with the plague stopping at the borders of the country. A sovkhoz manager Aleksandr Semenovich Rokk (whose name is also a pun on the novel's title, "Rok" meaning "fate") receives an official permission to confiscate Persikov's equipment, and use the invention to attempt to restore the chicken populace to the pre-plague level. However, the chicken eggs which are imported from outside the country are, by a mistake, sent to Persikov's laboratory while the reptile eggs destined for the professor end up in the hands of the farmers. As a result, Rokk breeds an enormous quantity of large and overly aggressive snakes, ostriches, and crocodiles which start attacking people. In the panic that follows, Persikov is killed by a mob — which blames him for the appearance of the snakes — and his cameras are smashed. The Red Army attempts to hold the snakes back, but only the coming of sub-zero weather in August—described as a deus ex machina—puts a stop to the snake invasion. In an earlier draft the novel ends with the scene of Moscow's complete destruction by the snakes.
Analysis and critical reception.
A number on influences on the novel can be detected. One of the sources behind "The Fatal Eggs" was H. G. Wells's 1904 novel "The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth", where two scientists discover a way to accelerate growth — which at first results in a plague of gigantic chickens, and eventually in an all-out war between people affected by growth and those who are not. The novel is in fact referenced in the text of the novel in a conversation between Persikov and his assistant. It has also been noted that the death of the snakes from cold weather though they successfully resisted the military force is reminiscent of the death of aliens from a pathogen bacteria in "The War of the Worlds". Other influences may include rumours of "a giant reptile the Crimea, to capture which a regiment of Red Guards was deployed".
Many Soviet critics saw the events of "The Fatal Eggs" as a critique of Soviet Russia. Indeed, there is a case to be made for Professor Persikov's identification with Vladimir Il'ich Lenin (note the similarity in names), as both of them can be said to have unleashed destruction on Russia, and there seem to be similarities between them both in appearance and character. Chicken plague and the sanitary cordons that foreign countries established against it were seen as a parody of the ideas of internationalism and the policy of Antanta against it. Although Bulgakov was not repressed, from 1925 he was questioned by the GPU several times and was never allowed to leave the Soviet Union, possibly as a result of his negative image which was at least partly due to the publication of "The Fatal Eggs". Although there were positive responses, upon the whole the novel was viewed as dangerous and anti-Soviet.
Bulgakov was aware that the story might be displeasing to the authorities - after presenting the story at a literary evening in late 1924, he wrote in his diary: 'Is it a satire? Or a provocative gesture? ... I'm afraid that I might be hauled off ... for all these heroic feats.' 
English translations.
There are a number of English translations of "The Fatal Eggs", including but not limited to the following:
Film, TV or theatrical adaptations.
A film adaptation directed by Sergei Lomkin was released in 1996. Cast included Oleg Yankovsky.
On April 17, 1981 the CBC Radio program Nightfall broadcast an adaptation.
A theatrical adaptation by Dustin Wills and Ilya Khodosh was produced at the Yale Cabaret in September 2012.
A two-part Italian TV adaptation was broadcast by RAI in 1977.

ATP Recordings

ATP Recordings is a British independent record label that was started in 2001 by London concert promoter Barry Hogan of Foundation/All Tomorrow's Parties. It was originally created to bring out a compilation cd (ATPRCD01) after the Tortoise-curated All Tomorrow's Parties event. First, everyone who attended the first festival was given a limited edition promotional sampler (PROATPFCD01), the packaging of which echoed the Factory Records style of Peter Saville. The full compilation followed later, and indeed a number of other ATP festivals would also receive the compilation treatment, the most recent being the 2006 Nightmare Before Christmas, for which ATPR and Plan B Magazine collaborated on a free cd given out to attendees.
The label eventually moved on from just doing compilations for the festival to sign bands like Threnody Ensemble, Bardo Pond, The Magic Band, Jackie-O Motherfucker, Deerhoof and White Out (with Jim O'Rourke). In recent years ATP Recordings has expanded and now also has on its roster Apse, Alexander Tucker, Death Vessel, The Drones, Fuck Buttons, Fursaxa, The Scientists, Sleepy Sun, Built To Spill and Autolux.
Towards the end of 2007 they announced plans to release a new series of double 7" singles called Custom Made, which would feature bands choosing four songs; one something old, one something new, one something borrowed (a cover version) and one something blue (artists were free to interpret this as they feel). The first artists to release singles in this series are The Drones, Alexander Tucker and Deerhoof.
The label also released a very special collector's edition of the classic Spiritualized album "Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space". The label announced in 2010 that they would now be releasing music from Built To Spill throughout Europe and Autolux worldwide (except Japan & North America). They have also announced the release of the debut solo album from The Drones frontman Gareth Liddiard.
For 2012 new signings include Tall Firs, Tennis and Anywhere (feat members of The Mars Volta, Triclops! and The Minutemen).

The Painter of Signs

The Painter of Signs is a 1976 novel by R. K. Narayan.
Plot.
It is one of narayan's fiction revolving and highlighting raman.This bittersweet novel is as fresh and charming today as it was when originally published. Raman, a conscientious sign-painter, who is trying to lead a rational life, the novel is filled with busy neighborhood life and gossip, the alternating rhythms and sounds of the city from morning till night, and the pungent smells and tantalizing flavors of home cooking, as Narayan portrays everyday life in Malgudi. The city is growing and changing, as its inhabitants try to carve out some individual successes within the juggernaut of “progress.” 
Raman, a college graduate, brings a sense of professionalism to his sign-painting, taking pride in his calligraphy and trying to create exactly the right sign, artistically, for each client. Living with his aged aunt, a devout, traditional woman whose days are spent running the house and tending to her nephew’s needs and whose evenings are spent at the temple listening to the old stories and praying, Raman prefers a rational approach to life, avoiding the explanations of life’s mysteries which religion provides. As he begins to write his aunt’s biography, which she is dictating, with all its portents and interventions by deities, Raman asks, “How could the Age of Reason be established if people were like this?” For his own life, he believes that “ultimately he can evolve a scheme for doing without money,” and that he can “get away from sex thoughts,” which he believes are “too much everywhere.” 
Then he meets Daisy. A young woman devoted to improving the lives of women and the standard of living of the country through strict family planning, Daisy becomes his biggest customer, commissioning signs for all the family planning clinics she helps establish through the city and outlying rural areas. Accompanying her so he can select exactly the right location and style for the signs that are needed in the countryside, he finds himself totally bewitched by this liberated and high-minded young woman. Inevitably, his attraction to Daisy proves more powerful than this desire to avoid the entanglements of marriage. 
Narayan is a master of the domestic scene, as he presents the major and minor conflicts of family life through the different points of view of the participants. Respect for his characters and a good-humored (and often humorous) presentation of their issues give warmth to his scenes and allow the reader to feel real empathy with the characters. Raman’s belief in his own rational enlightenment and his simultaneous vulnerability to Daisy’s manipulations provide the author with unlimited opportunities for dramatic irony—Ram’s extreme naivete sets him up for major crises and “learning experiences.” Scenes between Ram and his devout, elderly aunt provide a glimpse of the conflicts between old and new India, in addition to the generational conflicts every family faces between its young and its old. Scenes between Ram and Daisy reflect the changes in the role of women in society, as women become more assertive and liberated. 
These reflect the idea that Painter of Signs contains the preoccupation with human character and human relationships. As Raman finds himself being torn between his Aunt and Daisy, the traditional way and the modern way, we see the protagonist as being "in-between" in the town of Malgudi. At the end of the novel, Raman's aunt left for Benares on a pilgrimage and Daisy left the town of Malgudi to pursue her career which means that Raman is left alone in Malgudi. This depicts the fact that it seems as though Raman cannot facilitate either women or what they represent (traditionality and modernity respectively), thus presenting the problematic themes of human character and their relationships with one another.

Divona

In Gallo-Roman religion, Divona or Gaulish Devona is the eponymous goddess of a sacred spring that was the source of fresh water "(fons)" for the city of "Burdigala" (Bordeaux). She is hailed ("salve", compare Salve Regina) in a Latin poem by Ausonius, the 4th-century Bordelais scholar-poet who was the tutor of the emperor Gratian.
The word "Divona" derives from Gaulish "deuos", "divinity," and may simply be an honorific title rather than the name of a particular deity. It is a likely origin for place names such as "Divona Cadurcorum" ("Divona of the Cadurci," modern Cahors, Δηουόνα, "Dēvona" in Ptolemy), Divonne (Ain) (although other derivations are suggested), and Dionne (Côte-d'Or). The territory of the Celtic Cadurci, in the modern French department of Lot, was noted for its springs in antiquity; Frontinus notes that the Cadurcan town of Uxellodunum was surrounded by a river and had an abundance of freshwater sources "(fontes)".
In ancient Roman religion, goddesses of freshwater sources are often associated with the deity Fons, god of fountains and wellheads, honored at the Fontinalia for his role in the public water supply for the city. Ausonius invokes "fons", the manmade outlet that makes the water available to the people, with a string of adjectives: "sacer, alme, perennis, / vitree, glauce, profunde, sonore, illimis, opace", "sacred, life-giving, eternal, / glassy, blue-green, measureless, sonorous, free of mud, shaded." He hails "fons" as the "Genius of the city" "(urbis genius)" having the power to offer a healing draught "(medico potabilis haustu)". In the next line, Ausonius says that this "genius" or tutelary deity is "Divona" in the Celtic language "(Divona Celtarum lingua)", that is, "fons" added to the "divae" (plural).
The name also appears in inscriptions.

Linda Evans (radical)

Linda Sue Evans (born May 11, 1947) is an American radical leftist who was convicted for militant activities. Evans was sentenced in 1987 to 40 years in prison for using false identification to buy firearms and for harboring a fugitive in the 1981 Brinks armored truck robbery, in which two police officers and a guard were killed. In a second case, she was sentenced in 1990 to five years in prison for conspiracy and malicious destruction in connection with eight bombings including that of the U. S. Capitol in the mid-1980s. Her sentence was commuted in 2001 by President Bill Clinton.
Students for a Democratic Society.
Evans began her life as an activist by organizing demonstrations at Michigan State University during 1965. In 1967 Evans became a member of the East Coast chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). She stated that she became interested in the civil rights movement after getting attacked by police during a demonstration at the Pentagon. “When I first became a political activist, I was a pacifist. I had never experience real violence in my own life and naively hoped that it changed.” Evans demonstrated her interest in anti-racism movements by supporting various groups championing Black, Native and Puerto Rican causes.
Evans’ leadership role in SDS began after a conference held on July 15, 1969 at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. At this she announced that she would be traveling with six other anti-war activists to Hanoi to participate in the release of three U.S pilots who were being held as prisoners of war. At this conference, she also read a statement from SDS which declared the organization's support for the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Almost a month later, on August 7, 1969, Evans returned from Hanoi along with the prisoners of war through Trans World Airlines.
Soon after Evans return from Hanoi, SDS held various conferences so that she could relate her experiences in Hanoi. During these conferences Evans stated that "SDS is on the side of North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front", called the U.S. the aggressor, and spoke of the "extremely humane treatment" given to captured American GIs. To conclude many of her appearances, she mentioned how willing the Vietnamese women and children were to bear arms in order to fight for their cause, and told of seeing an antiaircraft gun operated by Viet Cong women, cradling the gun in her arms and "wishing that an American plane would come over."
Two of these conferences were notable for their high attendance. One took place at St. Joseph’s Episcopal Church in Detroit on August 11, 1969, while the other took place at Cleveland during the SDS National Conference held August 29 through September 1, 1969. While at the SDS national convention, Evans announced her loyalty to Communism.
In 1970 Evans was arrested for conspiracy and crossing state lines to incite a riot while organizing for SDS’s National Action, more commonly known as the Days of Rage. The charges were dropped after it was disclosed that the government had used illegal wiretaps to obtain evidence. Evans was released on a $75,000 bond.
After Evans was released from prison in 1970, she moved to Texas where she continued to participate in radical causes.
Weather Underground Organization.
Evans became involved in Weatherman, a group that derived from SDS. She organized and led many Weatherman actions. Following the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion that killed three Weatherman members (Ted Gold, Diana Oughton, and Terry Robbins), Evans was one of the Weatherman members who chose to go underground in 1970. During her membership in the Weather Underground Organization, Evans provided safe housing for members of the Weather Underground Organization and by providing funding for their assumed identities. She generated these funds through her participation in various robberies. Evans also participated in the May 19th Communist Movement, a group that included some former members of the Weather Underground Organization.
On April 15, 1970, Evans and Dianne Donghi were arrested for trying to forge checks using false identification. The FBI was able to arrest them because of a tip they received from an ex-member of Weatherman named Larry Grathwohl, who was working as an undercover informant for the FBI. Grathwohl's testimony was later used in Evans’ final arrest by the FBI to prove that she had repeatedly been involved in illegal activities. 
Evans' final arrest was on May 11, 1985 for harboring Marilyn Jean Buck, a fugitive in the 1981 Brinks armored truck robbery case, in which two police officers and a guard were murdered. At the time of her arrest, Evans was wearing a wig and glasses to disguise herself. The FBI agents obtained from her purse a Browning 9mm pistol and false documents with the name of Rebecca Ann Morgan, Christine Johnson, and Louise Robinett. The FBI was able to trace the gun to Louisiana, where Linda Evans was found to have purchased four firearms and three boxes of ammunition from three separate businesses under the false identity of Louise Robinett. Having purchased the four guns under a false identification, Evans was charged with eleven violations of the Gun Control Act of 1968. From March 16 to March 20, 1987 she was tried before a jury. Along with the eleven violations charges and housing a fugitive, she was also charged for terrorist actions after 740 pounds of dynamite were found in her apartment along with evidence of a plan to target the U.S Capitol Building, the National War College, the Navy Yard Computer Center, the Navy Yard Officers Club, Israeli Aircraft Industries, the FBI and the New York Patrolman’s Benevolent Association. On March 20, 1987 she was found guilty of all charges and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. 
While incarcerated at the Federal Corrections Institution in Dublin, Evans advocated for an AIDS educational program for women and lesbian inmates. She helped raise funds for the program by creating quilts and served as a peer AIDS counselor and educator. Evans advocated for inmates' rights, claiming that “When I was in jail in Louisiana we were able to win a jail house lawyer’s legal suit forcing the jail to give women glasses and false teeth”.
On January 20, 2001, President Bill Clinton commuted Evans' sentence, commuting her 40 year sentence to the 16-years already served.
Life since prison.
Along with her partner, Eve Goldberg, Evans travels around the United States advocating for lesbian and female inmates' rights. Evans is involved with the activist organization the Center for Third World Organizing. In March 2002 she held a conference entitled “Tear Down the Walls,” in an attempt to gain support for giving amnesty to people she identified as political prisoners, claiming that “These political prisoners of war are women and men incarcerated because of their involvement in political activities which challenged the unjust nature of the U.S socioeconomic system." 
In 2003 Evans gave an interview in which she identified her sexuality as an influence for her political activities, stating that “Being a lesbian has always been an important part of the reasons why I am a revolutionary – even before I was self-conscious about how important this is to me“ and “Because I experience real oppression as a lesbian and as a women, I am personally committed from the very core of being to winning liberation for women, lesbians, and all oppressed people.”

"Fuck Me Pumps" (also accredited as "Pumps") is a song by English singer–songwriter Amy Winehouse from her debut album, "Frank" (2003). Written by Winehouse and Salaam Remi, the song was released in the United Kingdom as the album's fourth and final single on 23 August 2004 under the title "Pumps"—with "Help Yourself" as its coupling track—, reaching number sixty-five on the UK Singles Chart. A clean radio edit was released for promotional purposes.
The track is about stereotypical "gold-digging" girls. The term "fuck-me pumps" or "FMPs" is a slang expression for sexy women's shoes, particularly those featuring bare heels.
Music video.
The music video for "Pumps" shows Winehouse walking the streets with a microphone wearing pumps (high-heeled shoes). It shows the type of girls whom Winehouse sings about in the song in front of a nightclub arguing, as well as Winehouse walking through several streets with a microphone in her hand. The farther she walks, the shorter the coil on the microphone gets. Along with the lyrical phrases about money-hungry women looking for security and love, Winehouse sarcastically explains the irony of it.

Kameradschaftsbund (Czechoslovakia)

The Kameradschaftsbund (KB) was a Völkisch organization, founded in 1920s Czechoslovakia. It was a meeting ground of Sudeten German intellectuals, preparing them for taking up leadership roles in a possible future independent Sudetenland.
Walther Heinrich and Heinz Rutha were founders of the movement, and drew heavily on the theories of Othmar Spann. At the end of the 1920s, the movement became also political active; one of the strategies used was the infiltration of the "Turnverband", by Konrad Henlein, one of the earliest KB members. Many "Kameradschaftsbund" members would later obtain top positions in the "Sudetendeutsche Partei" (SdP), under them Karl Hermann Frank and Walter Brand. After Rutha was charged with homosexual activity in 1937 (he later committed suicide), the KB gradually lost its influence on the SdP; Heinrich was sent to a concentration camp in 1938, and the SdP itself had to openly embrace German National Socialism.

Deborah Jane Coltman-Rogers (6 April 1938 – 30 April 2014) was a British literary agent.
Rogers was one of six siblings, her mother Stella Moore was an actress, and the niece of Mrs. Patrick Campbell, while her father worked in the City of London. She attended Hatherop Castle School in Gloucestershire, but did not go to university.
Her agency, originally Deborah Rogers Ltd, was established in 1967. Pat White soon joined, and the two women were joined by a third partner, Gill Coreridge, two decades later. At the end of her life, Rogers was the chairman of Rogers, Coleridge and White.
Among the authors Rogers represented were A. S. Byatt, Ian McEwan and Peter Carey. Earlier in her career she had represented Angela Carter, and (before he joined Andrew Wylie's agency) Salman Rushdie. Shortly after the professional breach, Rogers offered Rushdie her second home as a refuge from the fatwā (death sentence) imposed by Ayatollah Khomeini in February 1989. The remote farm in Powys was used by Rushdie during his decade in hiding.
Rogers was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award in International Publishing at the London Book Fair in April 2014. The award was presented by another of her clients, Kazuo Ishiguro, who had been introduced to Rogers by Angela Carter.
She married the composer Michael Berkeley in 1979; the couple had a daughter. Rogers died from a heart attack.

Points are given for high finishes and, in some cases, for winning sprints at certain places along the route, most often called "intermediate sprints". The points classification is the top prize for many cycling sprinters and is often known as the sprint classification; however, in some stage races these classifications are based on different criteria.
The points classification is arguably the second most important title and cycling jersey to win at a cycling stage race behind the general classification, which is the winner of the event by overall time.

Visna virus

Visna virus (also known as visna-maedi virus, maedi-visna virus and ovine lentivirus) from the genus lentivirinae and subfamily Orthoretrovirinae, is a "prototype" retrovirus that causes encephalitis and chronic pneumonitis in sheep. It is known as visna when found in the brain, and maedi when infecting the lungs. Lifelong, persistent infections in sheep occur in the lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, joints, central nervous system, and mammary glands; The condition is sometimes known as "ovine progressive pneumonia", particularly in the United States, or "Montana sheep disease". White blood cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage are the main target of visna virus.
Viral infection.
First described in 1954 by Bjorn Sigurdsson in Iceland, Maedi-visna virus was the first lentivirus to be isolated and characterized, accomplished in 1957 by Sigurdsson.</ref> ""Maedi"", Icelandic for dyspnoea, and ""visna"", Icelandic for "wasting" or "shrinking" of the spinal cord, refer to endemic sheep herd conditions that were only found to be related after Sigurdsson's work.
Visna infection may progress to total paralysis leading to death via inanition; however, if helped to obtain water and food, animals may survive for long periods of time, sometimes greater than ten years. Viral replication is almost exclusively associated with macrophages in infected tissues, however replication is restricted in these cells—that is, the majority of cells containing viral RNA do not produce infectious virus.
The disease was introduced to Iceland following an import of Karakul sheep from Germany in 1933. The susceptibility to maedi-visna infection varies across sheep breeds, with coarse-wool breeds apparently more susceptible than fine-wool sheep. Attempts at vaccination against maedi-visna virus failed to induce immunity, occasionally causing increased viremia and more severe disease. Eradication programs have been established in countries worldwide.
Model system for HIV infection.
Though it does not produce severe immunodeficiency, visna shares many characteristics with human immunodeficiency virus, including the establishment of persistent infection with chronic active lymphoproliferation; however, visna virus does not infect T-lymphocytes. The relationship of visna and HIV as lentiviruses was first published in 1985 by visna researcher Janice E. Clements and colleagues in the HIV field. It has been postulated that the effects of maedi-visna infection in sheep are the "equivalent" of central nervous system disease and wasting syndrome found in human AIDS patients. Despite limited sequence homology with HIV, the genomic organization of visna is very similar, allowing visna infection to be used as an "in vivo" and "in vitro" model system for HIV infection.
Research using visna was important in the identification and characterization of HIV. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated that the AIDS virus was a retrovirus related to visna and provided early clues as to the mechanism of HIV infection.
Control programs.
Many countries have some sort of national programme to prevent and control a situation where the virus spreads.

Ponca Fort

Nanza is the Ponca name for what is now called Ponca Fort. It was a fortified village built by the Ponca in the vicinity of present-day Niobrara, Nebraska, USA, in circa 1700 and occupied until about 1865.
The site of Nanza is located at the fork where Ponca Creek meets the Niobrara River, west of the Niobrara River's entry into the Missouri River. It is located in what is now Knox County, Nebraska, near the town of Verdel.
Nanza was a principal settlement for the Ponca and was built to protect the Ponca against the Arikaras, Cheyennes or Apaches. It contained earth lodges and was surrounded by several cemeteries, probably created during disease outbreaks after European contact. Today Ponca Fort lies on private property. The site is renowned among archaeologists for its resemblance to Middle Mississippian fortified towns found in Ohio which date from 800 through 1550.
Nanza comprises numerous earth lodge sites encircled by a protective wall perhaps six feet high. Today the fortification is still visible. Archeological excavations have determined there was originally a ditch three feet deep and ten feet wide surrounding the berm. An earth embankment supporting a post palisade was discovered inside the ditch. Guns, hatchets, knives, beads, kettles, cloth and other European goods have been recovered from Ponca Fort, and serve as a testimony to the village's important position in the local fur trade. There is also evidence of extensive trade with other tribes. Pottery, stone mauls, meeling slabs and maulers, bone knives, hoes, tubes, shaft wrenches and picks, and strip bark in rolls from as far away as the Southeastern United States.

Pedro Ansúrez

Pedro Ansúrez ("floruit" 1065–1117; died 9 September 1118) was a Castilian count of Liébana, Saldaña and Carrión in the closing decades of the eleventh century and the opening decades of the twelfth. He is considered the founder and first lord of Valladolid.
Pedro was a descendant of the Beni Gómez family of Castilian nobility, the son of Ansur Díaz and Justa Fernández, daughter of Count Fernando Flaínez. His grandfather, Diego Muñoz, was a count of Saldaña and Carrión. He married twice. His first wife was Elo Alfonso (or Eylo), daughter of Count Alfonso Muñoz and Aldonza González of Trigueros. They were married by 17 June 1084. She was dead by 17 September 1114, when Pedro made a donation for the good of her soul to the canons of the cathedral of Valladolid. He and his second wife, Elvira Sánchez, were married by the next day, if not long before. Pedro had five children: Alfonso, Fernando (Ferdinand), María (Mary), Mayor and Urraca. Alfonso died young and his sarcophagus, commissioned by Pedro, can still be seen in the museum of Sahagún. Pedro and Elo's children were raised in the household of a lesser nobleman: that of Citi Álvarez and his wife Froilo, who were duly rewarded for their services with a grant of land.
Pedro was one of the nobles closest to Alfonso VI of León and Castile, although the later claim that he was Alfonso's tutor or guardian during his youth must be dismissed, since the king and Pedro were of roughly the same age. During 24 July–3 September 1067 Pedro served as the majordomo of Alfonso's court. He was raised by the king to the rank of count perhaps as early as 22 November 1068, certainly before 1 November 1070, after which time he always signs charters using the title. In 1072, he accompanied Alfonso into exile in Toledo. Later, when Alfonso returned to inherit the kingdoms of León and Castile, Pedro and Eylo were charged with the repopulation of Valladolid. This they did with men from their counties of Saldaña and Carrión. However, the city really began to grow when its lordship was given to Pedro some years later. He became a prolific builder, constructing a large palace for himself and his wife, which has not survived, and a hospital. He built a bridge over the Pisuerga and many religious edifices, like the church of Santa María la Antigua and the Colegiata de Santa María, which served as the site of the cathedral (the bishop's seat). The environs of Valladolid formed the outer limits of the Kingdom of Castile at his time and Pedro was responsible for the repopulating of the region between Liébana and Cuéllar. His massive frontier district included the historically significant city of Toledo. In 1095, his lordship included Madrid.
Around 1087, at the time of the marriage of Alfonso's eldest daughter and heiress apparent, Urraca, to Raymond of Burgundy, the king appointed Pedro to be her guardian ("tutor"), and she stayed at his court according to the later "Primera Crónica General" (late 13th century). This probably served to prevent the accumulation of too great influence in the hands of the French. Towards the end of the century, Pedro's power and influence were diminished by the extension of that of the Capetians Raymond and Henry of Burgundy.
When his daughter María was widowed by the Count of Urgel, Ermengol V, Pedro transferred the guardianship of her son, Ermengol VI, to Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona. Between 1103 and 1108, Pedro was in exile in Urgel, having displeased Alfonso VI. He took an active part in the conquest of Balaguer. Pedro brought with him to Urgell his armour-bearer ("armiger"), a knight by the name of Íñigo Pérez. Only the greater magnates could afford to employ officers like this. The "armiger", or "alférez", was responsible for leading Pedro's "mesnada" (retinue) into battle.
In 1114, out of fear of Hell, Pedro Ansúrez donated some land at Fuensaldaña to the church of Valladolid.
In 1143, Sancho Ansúrez, Pedro's grandson by his daughter Urraca, introduced the Premonstratensian Order into Spain when he became abbot of Fuentesclaras, moved to Retuerta in 1146. Sancho had studied under Saint Norbert at Prémontré.

Nave &amp; McCord Mercantile Company

The Nave & McCord Mercantile Company was a major pioneer mercantile chain of stores in the Midwest from the mid-19th century through the early 1930s. The company’s primary founders were brothers-in-law Abram Nave and James McCord.
Early history.
One of four children of Henry B. and Mary (Brooks) Nave, Abram Nave was born June 15, 1815, in Cocke County, Tennessee, and came to Saline County, Missouri, with his family about a year later. In 1841, Abram made his first business venture with $1,000 borrowed from his father. With the capital, he opened a general store in Savannah, a small town located in Andrew County, Missouri. He had arrived in town with a single wagonload of miscellaneous merchandise that he sold in a small building on the west side of the town square. The following year he married Lucy McCord in Saline County. She was born September 30, 1822 in Randolph County, Virginia. They would eventually have six children, two of which died young. 
In 1846, Abram opened another store under the name Nave & McCord in Oregon, Missouri, with his brother-in-law, James McCord. It was a partnership that would last 52 years, until Abram died. James was born January 7, 1826, in Randolph County, Virginia, one of four children (and only son) of William McCord and Sally Moss Field. He married Mary E. Hallick and they had 10 children.
From 1850-57, Abram, James and Dudley M. Steele were partners in the company Steele, McCord & Company that drove cattle, mules and other livestock from Missouri to Sacramento, California, where the animals were sold at a high profit. In the July 19, 1856, issue of the "North West Democrat" newspaper, it’s stated “Abram Nave reached home a few days ago from California. His numerous friends will be glad to hear he is in good health.”
Company formed.
Abram and James formed the wholesale grocery company Nave, McCord & Company in 1857 in St. Joseph, Missouri. By 1860, the company had expanded its operations over an extensive territory and branch offices were soon opened in Omaha, Nebraska (with partner Charles L. Clark), and Kansas City, Missouri. However, despite the company’s growth, 1860 would prove to be a disastrous year. On the morning of July 5, 1860, fire broke out in the upper floor of the Nave & McCord building in St. Joseph. The building’s walls collapsed before the general alarm was given. The debris completely covered the tenement and nine people perished. Two of Nave & McCord’s clerks, who slept in the second story, had a narrow escape. The insurance companies refused to pay the loss on the building upon the grounds that the collapse had occurred before the fire. The case was tried at St. Louis, and after eight years of litigation resulted favorably to Nave & McCord thanks to an eyewitness. A guest at the nearby Patee House had been unable to sleep owing to the hot weather. Seated at his window, he said he noticed the flames and watched the fire for some time before he heard the crash when the building collapsed. Abram and James rebuilt their company and managed to continue its success.
Other investments.
With the company back in the black, Abram began to diversify his interests, including the St. Joseph & Denver Railroad, and various banks, insurance companies and other firms. 
In 1868, Abram co-founded Leech, Nave & Company in Kansas City, which later became a Nave & McCord branch office. In 1872, he co-founded the wholesale grocery house Nave, Goddard & Company in St. Louis. Later this store also became part of the Nave & McCord chain. Abram remained in St. Louis for 10 years overseeing the company before returning to St. Joseph. He also became a partner with James and others in the Smith-McCord Dry Goods Company in Pueblo, Colo., and a stockholder in the Henry Krug Packing Company in St. Joseph. 
The C.D. Smith & Company was founded in St. Joseph in 1859 with Abram and James as co-partners with Dudley M. Steele and Charles Daniel Smith, the latter of which was the company’s manager. The company was originally a grocery wholesale business, but later became a drug store in 1886. Amazingly, the company remained in the Smith family for 133 years until it was bought by company employees in 1992. C.D. Smith Healthcare was acquired by AmeriSource Health Corporation in 1999.
In 1879, a new Omaha branch of the mercantile company was opened under the name Nave, McCord & Brady. John Speer Brady moved to St. Joseph, Mo., in 1866 and got a job soon after at Nave, McCord & Company. After 13 years of service, he opened the Omaha branch and managed it. Abram eventually sold his interest in the branch and it was renamed the McCord-Brady Company. The building still stands and became Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts in 1995. Another McCord-Brady office was later opened in Cheyenne, Wyoming, from 1915-32. 
More than 10 years younger than Abram, James McCord continued to branch out on his own with various mercantile and grocery businesses in Fort Worth, Texas; Oklahoma City; Kansas City, Mo.; Topeka, Kansas; and Hutchinson, Kansas; as well as a real estate firm in St. Joseph.
Abram’s wife Lucy died November 9, 1853, in Savannah. He married his second wife, Mary _______, about 1878. They ended up in a bitter divorce. Abram married a third time to Augusta Bagwell on Feb. 25, 1885. He had no children from either of these latter marriages.
Incorporation.
Nave, McCord & Company was incorporated and re-christened as the Nave & McCord Mercantile Company in 1880. Also in 1880, property was secured for a new building in St. Joseph on South Third Street near the lines of the Missouri Pacific and the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railroads. Disaster struck again when a handcart loaded with nails crashed into the supporting timbers and set fire to the uncompleted edifice by crashing into an area in which matches were stored. The new five-story, brick building was finally completed in 1882. That same year, a new branch office was opened in Atchison, Kansas.

The Nave-McCord Cattle Company was formed in 1881 in Texas with an initial investment of 1,500 cattle and the purchase of the range rights on the Double Mountain Fork Brazos River at the mouth of Spring Creek in Garza County, Texas. The company created the Square and Compass Ranch after purchasing in Garza County. About half of the ranch land was on the Llano Estacado, which was high and level and good summer pasture, and the rest was in the broken land, which made excellent winter pasture. The herd was gradually increased through additional purchases to 15,000 head. The Square and Compass name and brand were reportedly patterned after the emblem of the Masons, of which Abram was a member. Fenced in 1884, the ranch was operated at a modest profit despite blizzards and drought in 1886. The ranch and cattle were sold in 1901 to John B. Slaughter, who renamed it the U Lazy S Ranch. The sale included of land at $1.60 an acre and 5,000 cattle.
Dissolution.
Abram Nave died June 23, 1898, in St. Joseph, and James McCord died September 24, 1903 in the same city. By then, the sons of both men had become involved in Nave & McCord. St. Joseph city directories show that the Nave & McCord Mercantile Company lasted until at least 1930, but the company was liquidated soon afterward. Like so many businesses during this time, it was most likely a victim of the Depression. Today several of the company’s former buildings still stand, including those in St. Joseph, Mo; Atchison, Kan.; and Omaha, Neb.

Enmesarra, or Enmešarra, in Sumerian and Akkadian mythology is an underworld god of the law. Described as a Sun god, protector of flocks and vegetation, and therefore he has been equated with Nergal. On the other hand, he has been described as an ancestor of Enlil, and it has been claimed that Enlil slew him.

Stok Kangri

Stok Kangri (elevation 6,153 m (20,182 feet) is the highest mountain in the Stok Range of the Himalayas in the Ladakh region of northwest India. The peak is located in Hemis National Park, 12 km southwest of the trailhead at 3,610 m (11,845 feet) in the village of Stok and 24 km southwest of the Ladakhi capital of Leh. Despite its altitude, Stok Kangri is a popular peak and is often climbed as an initial non-technical foray into high altitude mountaineering.
In late July and August, all but the top of the peak may be snow-free, as can be seen by clicking on and following the Google Earth link, which leads to some excellent new high resolution satellite imagery. The elevation data was verified by GPS readings from 11 satellites at the Summit during a late July 2007 joint Nepalese-US expedition which encountered snow cover for 85% of the final four hour, four km, 900 metre climb.
The shortest and most popular approach to the peak ascends the Stok valley, along the Stok Chu. This valley's grazing landscape, especially near the village Stok, was decimated by flooding in the first week of August 2006, the most severe in decades.
The first official winter season ascent was made in March/April 2002, by the Bicton college team, which had three members on the summit. Snow was so deep base camp was located over a mile down an adjacent valley pitched on the frozen river.
The peak has been judged safe enough to climb for teams by expedition companies.

Military history of Ethiopia

The military history of Ethiopia dates back to the formation of the modern nation in 980 BC. Ethiopia has been involved in most major conflicts in the African region.
First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895–1896).
From 1895 to 1896, the First Italian-Abyssinian War was fought between the Kingdom of Italy and the Ethiopian Empire (Abyssinia). Unlike most of Africa, Ethiopia was able to avoid being conquered by the European powers. In 1895, Italian armed forces invaded Ethiopia from Eritrea. But, because Ethiopia had established a single and incorporated army and broke ethnic barriers to unite, the Italian regular forces were decisively defeated within a year at the Battle of Adwa. Special role for this purpose was played by the Russian military advisers and volunteers of Menylik's army (for example Leonid Artamonov).
Boundary confrontation ("cold" war) against the Britannic colonialists (1896–1899).
After successful colonial capture of the Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, could to started the new pressure of Britannic forces against Ethiopia, which made off only after the beginning of The Second Boer War 1899-1902. The Ethiopian army became more effective by what Britannic colonial forces. The numerous expeditions of Ethiopian forces stopped colonial expansion.
As could to write the Alexander Bulatovich (one of the Russian military advisers and participant of expedition of legendary army of Ras Wolde Giyorgis) - "Many consider the Abyssinian army to be undisciplined. They think that it is not in condition to withstand a serious fight with a well-organized European army, claiming that the recent war with Italy doesn't prove anything. 
I will not begin to guess the future, and will say only this. Over the course of four months, I watched this army closely. It is unique in the world. And I can bear witness to the fact that it is not quite so chaotic as it seems at first glance, and that on the contrary, it is profoundly disciplined, though in its own unique way. For every Abyssinian, war is the most usual business, and military skills and rules of army life in the field enter in the flesh and blood of each of them, just as do the main principles of tactics. On the march, each soldier knows how to arrange necessary comforts for himself and to spare his strength; but on the other hand, when necessary, he shows such endurance and is capable of action in conditions which are difficult even to imagine. 
You see remarkable expediency in all the actions and skills of this army; and each soldier has an amazingly intelligent attitude toward managing the mission of the battle. 
Despite such qualities, because of its impetuousness, it is much more difficult to control this army than a well-drilled European army, and I can only marvel at and admire the skill of its leaders and chiefs, of whom there is no shortage."
In obedience to the agreement with Russia and the order of Menelik II, First Ethiopian officers had begin to trained at the First Russian cadet school at 1901. 30-40 Ethiopian officers could to had military teaching at Russia for period 1901-1913, they could to had Russian Higher military education. So Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam was one of them.
In accordance with the order of emperor of Ethiopia, Directly Nikolay Leontiev organized the first battalion of the regular Ethiopian army, it was represented to Menelik II, in February, 1899. Leontiev formed an first regular battalion, the kernel of which became the company of volunteers from the former Senegal shooters (disappointed or unreliable for colonial authorities), which he chose and invited from Western Africa, with training of the Russian and French officers. The first Ethiopian military orchestra was organized at the same time.
Second Italo-Abyssinian War.
On October 3, 1935, Fascist Italy invaded the Ethiopian Empire from Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. Italian forces were able to defeat the Ethiopian forces in eight months with superior manpower and advanced weaponry. In violation of International agreements, the Italians used poisonous gas in a number of battles; although some historians (for example, Anthony Mockler) consider the effect of this weapon in battle negligible at best, it added infamy to the Italian invasion.
The Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the Spanish Civil War, and the Mukden Incident are often seen as precursors to World War II, and a demonstration of the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations. In 1941, after years of occupation, Emperor Haile Selassie I returned to what was now called Italian East Africa. With the help of the British, the Emperor led an uprising to drive the Italian Army from his country.
World War II.
In 1941, after years of occupation, Emperor Haile Selassie I returned to what was now called Italian East Africa. With the help of the British and the Congolese Force Publique, the Emperor led an uprising to drive the Italian Army from his country.
Indeed, when Italy entered World War II, Ethiopia was still under Italian occupation as part of Italian East Africa. However, even after the Italian invasion, some areas of the country remained under the control of Ethiopian armed resistance groups called "Arbegnoch": according to some Ethiopian historians, approximately in 1/4 of the country there was never under effective Italian control.
Indeed, the liberation of Ethiopia started in early 1941 during the East African Campaign.
After some initial Italian offensive actions in 1940 (conquest of Kassala in Sudan and British Somalia), British and Commonwealth forces launched attacks from the Sudan and from Kenya. Emperor Haile Selassie joined the resistance groups and on 5 May 1941, the Emperor re-entered Addis Ababa, five years to the day from when he was forced to flee. By the end of November, organized Italian resistance in East Africa ended with the fall of Gondar.
However Italians maintained a guerrilla war, mainly in northern Ethiopia, until September 1943.
Korean War.
Ethiopia sent 1,271 - 3,518 troops as part of the United Nation Forces to aid South Korea. The troops were known as the Kagnew Battalion under the command of General Mulugueta Bulli. It was attached to the American 7th Infantry Division, and fought in a number of engagements including the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. 121 were killed and 536 wounded during the Korean War.
Derg Rule.
In 1974, a military coup overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie and declared Ethiopia a republic. Between 1974 and 1984, a communist military junta called Derg ruled.
Ogaden War.
Somalia invaded the Ogaden region and starting the Ogaden War. Fighting erupted as Somalia attempted a temporary shift in the regional balance of power in their favour by occupying the Ogaden region. The Soviet Union switched from supplying Somalia to supporting Ethiopia, which had previously been backed by the United States. The war ended when Somali forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. Ethiopia was able to defeat the Somali forces with the aid of the USSR, Cuba, and South Yemen. This was the first conflict in which the Mi-24 was used.
Civil War.
The Ethiopian Civil War was a 17-year conflict between the Derg government backed by the USSR against anti-communist rebels backed by the United States. The conflict ended in 1991 with the Derg government defeated and out of power along with Eritrea gaining independence. The Eritrean insurgence that began in 1961 was helped by a nationwide Ethiopian guerrilla campaign of OLF, TPLF and ONLF against the Ethiopian Derg government. At the end of the Civil war, with the Eritrean and Ethiopian victory over the Derg government, Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopia in 1991 following a referendum.
Eritrean-Ethiopian War.
The Eritrean-Ethiopian War was a border clash that took place from May 1998 to June 2000.
Fighting escalated to artillery and tank fire leading to four weeks of intense fighting. Ground troops fought on three fronts. Eritrea claims Ethiopia launched air strikes against Eritrea's capital Asmara while Ethiopia accused Eritrea of striking first. The fighting led to massive internal displacement in both countries as civilians fled the war zone.
The conflict ended in stalemate and deployment of UNMEE.
Somalia.
In 2006, Ethiopia deployed troops to aid the TFG in the ongoing Somali Civil War. ENDF deployed troops in the northern region to aid the TFG and in the southern region with support from the United States Fifth Fleet. By January 2007 Ethiopian forces were about 200,000 troops. On November 2008 Ethiopia announced that they would be removing their troops, and all Ethiopian forces had left the country by January 15, 2009.

Gerald Francis Clifford (June 19, 1889 - February 25, 1952) enjoyed a state-wide reputation as a trial lawyer, politician and officer of the Green Bay Packers. Clifford served as the team’s vice-president and attorney for nearly three decades, setting up the unique and enduring corporate structure, fighting off near bankruptcy several times and quashing an attempt to move the team.
Clifford was born on June 19, 1889 in Chilton, Wisconsin. He was the son of Jeremiah M. and Catherine Connelly Clifford. His father was employed with the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad and the family lived in Iron Mountain and later Escanaba, Michigan.
After graduating from high school, Clifford traveled throughout Europe, then returned to attend the University of Michigan, receiving an LL.B. in 1912. He began his practice of law that same year in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where his father was now regional superintendent.
Throughout his career, Clifford practiced in a variously arranged small firm in Green Bay. He defended twenty-six first degree murder cases, with no clients convicted of the original charge. Clifford made many appearances before the Wisconsin Supreme Court and served as both a special prosecutor and Special Assistant Attorney General of Wisconsin.
Politically, Clifford was a liberal Democrat and a supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. As Wisconsin’s Progressive Party collapsed, he worked to bring its members into the Democratic Party. He was a longtime member of the State Central Committee and was a frequent speaker at state conventions. Clifford served as a delegate to all four national conventions that nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was the Democratic Party nominee for Congress in 1934.

John W. Campbell (New York)

John Williams Campbell (1880 – 1957) was a millionaire American financier. Campbell succeeded his father in a management role at Credit Clearing House. He kept an office at Grand Central Terminal in New York City. It was later converted into a bar called the Campbell Apartment, which is now a popular gathering spot for commuters and others after work. 
Biographical information.
Campbell was the son of John H. Campbell, the treasurer of Credit Clearing House, a credit-reference firm specializing in the garment industry. The younger Campbell had two sisters and an older brother. The family lived on Cumberland Street, in the affluent Brooklyn neighborhood known as The Hill, now called Fort Greene.
Having never attended college, Campbell started work at 18 at his father’s firm, where he became a senior executive at 25 and later president and chairman. In 1941, Credit Clearing House merged with Dun & Bradstreet. 
He married the former Rosalind D. Casanave, nicknamed Princess, who was once listed in the New York Times as a “patroness” of a “Monte Carlo party and dance” at the Westchester Country Club. 
In 1920, at the age of 40, Campbell was appointed to the board of New York Central Railroad, where he crossed paths with William Kissam Vanderbilt II, the railroad scion whose office was in Grand Central Terminal. It is probable that Vanderbilt showed Campbell the space. Campbell became chairman of the board of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, keeping the position until he died in 1957.
Office in Grand Central.
Like other successful tycoons of the day, Campbell demanded a grand office, one convenient to his clients and close to the railroad so he could commute first from a nearby 270 Park Avenue apartment, and later, from the Westchester Country Club to the north. To satisfy these needs, he leased of space from Grand Central Terminal. It was a single room long by wide with a ceiling and an enormous fireplace in which he kept a steel safe.
In 1923, Campbell commissioned Augustus N. Allen, an architect known for designing estates on Long Island and townhouses in Manhattan, to build an office in the leased space in Grand Central. He transformed it into a 13th-century Florentine palace with a hand-painted plaster of Paris ceiling and leaded windows. He installed 19th-century Italian chairs and tables, an art collection worth more than $1 million, and a massive desk from which he conducted business. One of the most striking features was a Persian carpet that took up the entire floor and was said to have cost $300,000 at the time, or roughly $3.5 million today. Campbell added a piano and pipe organ, and at night turned his office into a reception hall, entertaining 50 or 60 friends who came to hear famous musicians play private recitals. He had a permanent butler named Stackhouse.
After Campbell’s death in 1957, the rug and other furnishings disappeared from his office and the space eventually became a signalman’s office and later a closet at Grand Central, where the transit police stored guns and other equipment. It also became a small jail, in the area of the present-day bar.
The Campbell Apartment.
Not until 1999, long after his death, was the office of John W. Campbell restored and renovated into a public bar and lounge called the Campbell Apartment. The name is apparently a misnomer, people having assumed that such a grand space was an apartment, not an office. The walls and ceiling were brought back to their former glory and the original steel safe, once hidden behind a wall, now sits in the massive fireplace as a reminder of Campbell's wealth. The renovation cost $1.5 million.
In 2006, Mark Grossich, who restored the leased space and owns the bar, decided the Campbell Apartment needed further updating. He hired Nina Campbell, an interior designer in London, to spruce it up. She replaced a largely blue palette with a largely red one, including new carpet, bar stools and chairs. To avoid closing for even one night, the renovation took place in less than 12 hours and cost $350,000.

Taupo railway proposals

There have been a number of proposals to build a Taupo Line as a branch railway linking the township of Taupo in the central North Island of New Zealand to New Zealand's rail network. One proposal proceeded as far as the construction stage before being stopped.
Background.
By 1952, nearly every main centre in New Zealand was served by a railway, the exceptions being Kaitaia, Queenstown and Taupo. Taupo is one of New Zealand's biggest forestry centres and is a very popular tourist destination.
Proposed routes.
North Island Main Trunk line.
The first time consideration was made to link Taupo with a railway was in 1884 when routes for extending the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) railway south from Te Awamutu to Wellington were being explored and surveyed. One of the proposed routes was from just south of Te Awamutu following the course of the Puniu River inland through to Taupo, and onwards east to link at Hastings with the proposed Palmerston North - Gisborne Line. This route did not eventuate and the present route via Taumarunui was chosen.
Mokai Tramway.
In 1903 the Taupo Totara Timber Company (TTT Co) constructed an 82 km tramway to link their milling centre at Mokai with the New Zealand Government Railways line (NZR) at Putaruru. The line was built over the former Lichfield Branch line, which was originally built by the Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company to be part of the line to Rotorua. The TTT Co line then went onwards south of Lichfield through what are now Tokoroa and Kinleith and crossed the Waikato River at Ongaroto. 
At Ongaroto the company built a large timber bridge of locally-sourced totara, designed by Public Works Department engineer F. W. Furkert. In later years this timber bridge deteriorated and was condemned, but the company could not afford to replace it immediately because its sawmill had burned down in 1928. In the last few years of service, trains arriving at the bridge would stop and the passengers and fireman would walk across while the driver gently opened the throttle and then jumped off. The train would slowly ease across the bridge before being stopped on the other side by the fireman, where everyone would reboard the train. This bridge was replaced in 1931 by a steel truss bridge with a central pier. 
In general the TTT Co line was constructed to a fairly high standard for a bush tramway, with 1 in 30 grades and 30 metre radius curves. This reflected the company's ultimate intention to sell the line to NZR. 
In 1911 the TTT Co put forward a proposal to extend their line from Mokai into Taupo township via Oruanui. The station, and terminus of the line, was to be on Spa Road where Taupo-Nui-a-Tia College now stands. This would have required another bridge across the Waikato River. 
The proposal was quickly endorsed and praised by many in Taupo, and to support the extension the Taupo District Railway League was formed with powers to support the scheme and ensure it succeeded. The TTT Co proposed running the railway as a private trust-owned company. 
However, considerable objection was made to this proposal by the people of Rotorua, in particular the Rotorua Chamber of Commerce. They believed that any railway to Taupo should be from the railhead at Rotorua, running south via Waiotapu. The Rotorua Chamber of Commerce lodged a complaint to Parliament regarding the proposal. The Taupo District Railway League consequently lodged a complaint to the Member of Parliament for the district, Mr MacDonald, protesting the opposition being made by the Rotorua Chamber of Commerce. 
As time passed the proposal for the TTT Co scheme was eventually shelved, largely due to the outbreak of World War I and due to the considerable objections being made by the Rotorua Chamber of Commerce. The line would have required considerable improvements to bring it up to NZR standard as it was only built to carry timber and it consequently had very tight curves, narrow cuttings and light rails. It was not a fast railway line at all and the passengers that the TTT Co trains carried were noted to be able to climb off the train and walk alongside the train as it slowly crawled along. 
The TTT Co line eventually closed on 26 October 1944. However the Government saw that the line had greater potential and in September 1946 acquired the first 29 km between Putaruru and Kinleith. This section of line opened again on 9 June 1947 under the control of the Public Works Department using steam locomotives purchased from the TTT Co. 
Around the same time plans were being made for a large pulp and paper mill to be constructed at Kinleith. The line with its sharp curves, steep grades and light rails, needed to be significantly upgraded to enable heavy traffic. Reconstruction of the line began in 1949, reducing grades from 1 in 44 to 1 in 70 and curves from 201 metre radius to 322 metre radius. The rebuilt line was handed over to NZR on 12 June 1950.
Around this time there was a proposal to rebuild the line and extend it to Taupo. Nothing further was heard of this proposal after the 1949 election. This proposal has been brought up many times since.
Rotorua–Taupo line.
Proposals to link Taupo with Rotorua and the greater Bay of Plenty with a railway date back to 1911. It had long been intended that the Rotorua Branch would be extended into the Bay of Plenty to connect with the line being built from Gisborne. A railway into the Bay of Plenty would link Rotorua and surrounding regions to the Port of Tauranga. Rotorua interests at the time lobbied very hard to have a line built between Rotorua and the Bay of Plenty, claiming the considerable amounts of land which would be opened up and linked to the port, particularly if the line were to be extended to Taupo.
When the TTT Co announced a proposal in 1911 to extend its line running from Putaruru to Mokai into Taupo, this caused much upset in Rotorua, as it weakened Rotorua's case to have a line built to link Rotorua with the Port of Tauranga. The Rotorua Chamber of Commence consequently voiced strong opposition to the TTT Co proposal, and said that "any railway connection to Taupo should be from the Government railway at Rotorua".
The Government however was more focused on completing the East Coast Main Trunk Railway linking Tauranga and Gisborne, and would not consider linking Rotorua to the Bay of Plenty until that line was completed. The outbreak of World War I temporarily put a stop to the Rotorua proposal but once the war was over, enthusiasm for a line to link Rotorua and Taupo with the Port of Tauranga was renewed. 
In 1920 a Royal Commission was set up to investigate the viability of the government purchasing either the entire TTT Co or just the TTT Co tramway and options for building a railway into Taupo. The commission consisted of H.J.H. Blow, chief engineer of the Public Works Department, as chairman; Mr. F.W. Furkert, chief engineer of the TTT Co; Mr. H. Buxton of NZR; and Mr. G.H.M. McClure, Commissioner of Crown Lands for Wellington, with Mr. H.H. Sterling as secretary. In 1921 the commission brought forward a unanimous finding "There is urgent necessity in order to avoid great national waste, for an extension of the Rotorua Government Railway to Waiotapu with as little delay as possible". Despite this finding no further action was taken by the government. However the Rotorua Taupo Railway League, led by Edward Earle Vaile, continued to vigorously campaign for the Rotorua–Taupo railway to be built.
In May 1922 a Royal Commission was set up to investigate the construction and working of a Rotorua–Taupo railway, with five members: H. Buxton, G. T. Murray, L.M. Ellis, J.D. Ritchie and H. Munro. Its terms of reference were to access anticipated traffic and profitability and assess the area's settlement potential and a possible route. A favourable report was returned by the commission; however despite this, no further action was taken by the government.
In 1924 a line from Rotorua to Reporoa was authorised by Parliament but construction was not started as the Government's focus at the time was on completing the construction of the East Coast Main Trunk line.
Much lobbying continued by Rotorua interests and by the Rotorua Taupo Railway League, which consisted of settlers living between Taupo and Rotorua. By 1928 support for the Rotorua–Taupo line was very strong.
Cabinet approval.
In July 1928 the Coates government cabinet approved the construction of the Rotorua–Taupo railway. The line was to be constructed initially as far as Waiotapu, and then onwards to Taupo via Reporoa. Work began almost immediately with teams of construction workers transferred from the Taneatua–Opotiki line, which had been stopped. In Rotorua it had been hoped that work on the line would go to Rotorua people, as unemployment was very high in the town. For approximately one year from the date of approval by cabinet, men worked on constructing embankments and cuttings along the proposed route a short distance out of Rotorua between Waipa and Waiotapu. 
However in 1929, as a result of the depression and a downturn in economic activity, the Forbes government cabinet announced that work on the Rotorua–Taupo railway would cease as soon as jobs could be found in other parts of the country for the men working on this scheme. This was a real blow to the supporters of the railway, and did not help Rotorua at a time of high unemployment. There was much vocal opposition in Rotorua at the line being stopped and calls for the work to be resumed. The Rotorua Taupo Railway League produced a pamphlet titled "The truth about the Taupo Railway - the story of a great crime" arguing the need for and numerous benefits this line would bring, and the unjust stopping of the project by the government. The work did not resume and the formation and cuttings were abandoned. Some of this work can still be seen between Rotorua and Taupo along State Highway 5, on the western side of the road, a short distance out of Rotorua. 
From 1929 onwards there were various calls for the railway between Rotorua and Taupo to be restarted but nothing of any great significance until 1968 when NZR announced a proposal to construct a new line to Rotorua from Paengaroa on the East Coast Main Trunk, with an extension to the Waipa State Mill. An extension to Taupo was also seen by NZR "as being very attractive". 
The proposal created much attention both in support and against the idea. NZR wanted a better link into the Rotorua region to tap into and serve the central North Island pine forests with the Port of Tauranga and a line with easier grades than the steep line over the Mamaku ranges.
The route of the proposed new line and in particular, the proposed siting of new marshaling yards at Rotorua was the reason for much of the objections. NZR wanted to extend the existing Rotorua branch line from the central city station, across Fenton Street to Ngapuna where they proposed having a large marshaling yard, along with a spur line running south to the Waipa State Mill. Many people in Rotorua objected to having a railway crossing Fenton Street and wanted the railway marshaling yards located at Waipa instead of Ngapuna. NZR objected to shifting the marshaling yards, as it would significantly increase the cost of the project.
However an equally great number of people in Rotorua supported the railway proposal and consequently it became a hot political debate. By 1973 NZR started to back down on the proposal and stated that the scheme would only proceed if the people of Rotorua agreed upon where the marshaling yards would be located. This of course was never likely to occur and consequently the scheme fell though shortly after. This was the last time serious consideration was given for a railway to Taupo from Rotorua.
In 1989 the central city station and railway yard at Rotorua closed, and along with the last 2 km of the line, were lifted and relocated to Koutu.
Kakahi - Pukawa line.
A proposal to construct a railway between Kakahi on the North Island Main Trunk and Pukawa on the shores of Lake Taupo, near Tokaanu, was made by a group of three people - Te Heuheu Tukino, Paramount chief of the Ngati Tuwharetoa iwi (tribe); Lawrence Grace, who was closely related through marriage to the tribe; and Tudor Atkinson, the founder of the TTT Co.
The three set up a company called the Tongariro Timber Company Limited with the intention to construct the railway and to have branch lines heading into the bush at various points along the route to harvest the native timber along the way. The railway was intended to be paid for using some of the large sums of money expected to be earned from the timber to be harvested. It was agreed that the land would remain in Maori ownership and that the Tongariro Timber Company Limited would operate the railway. Once the railway was built the company would carry freight other than timber, such as dressed flax and grain, and passengers at Government rates. The railway would connect with a ferry service on Lake Taupo.
In January 1908 an Order in Council was made allowing the Maori owners to sell land for the construction of the railway. Work began immediately on surveying the proposed railway line. Tudor Atkinson tried locally to raise the necessary capital to build the railway. His efforts proved unsuccessful, and in 1916 he went to London where he formed a separate company to finance the railway. However World War I intervened and the company ended up being dissolved with all money being returned to the prospective shareholders.
In 1913 the Egmont Box Company Limited arrived at Kakahi in search of white pine (Kahikatea) for constructing boxes for dairy products. The company found suitable quantities of white pine on land next to which the Tongariro Timber Company held cutting rights to. The company obtained the cutting rights to this land, however it was found that the Egmont Box Company would need to construct a light railway to haul the logs out on. With the Tongariro Timber Company already having plans to build such a railway, it was proposed that the railway be constructed jointly by the two companies. 
It was agreed that the Egmont Box Company would construct the railway as far as the land that they were to harvest logs from, and then the Tongariro Timber Company would construct the rest of the line to Pukawa. Work started immediately and soon various cuttings, bridging, and track had been laid. However with World War I by now claiming many of the necessary fit and able men needed to do the job, work began to slow and it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain materials. 
In 1916 progress was further hindered with the New Zealand Government Railways (NZR) changing its mind on how the line was to connect with their line at Kakahi station. This meant that the Egmont Box Company would need to spend a very large amount of money to change the route to that now required to join up with the NZR line at Kakahi. This was money the company did not have and nor did the Tongariro Timber Company. Tudor Atkinson tried very hard to obtain the necessary capital but from this time onwards it was to be the end of the scheme as far as the Tongariro Timber Company and Egmont Box Company were concerned. 
Other parties tried to carry out and construct the railway, but all failed to do so with either not being able to obtain the necessary capital or the economic viability of the scheme prevented them making any progress. One group in the 1920s however did raise the necessary capital and gained the support from the Maori landowners but not the Government. Consequently this lack of support from the Government was why their scheme did not eventuate. 
The forest between Kakahi and Lake Taupo remained standing until after World War II when it was felled. By then the railway proposal had given way to road transport. Today all that can be seen of this scheme is the rail formation and large cutting built from Kakahi to the Whakapapa River.
Murupara Branch line.
Since 1983 there have been proposals to extend the Murupara Branch line to Taupo. The principal reason for extending this line has been to tap into the plantation pine forests in the central North Island and in particular those in the Taupo region.
1983 proposal.
In 1983 a study by town and country planners of the Ministry of Works found that if a railway were to constructed into the Taupo region, it would be very beneficial in transporting logs and sawn timber out of the region to the Pulp and Paper Mill at Kawerau and for export through the Port of Tauranga. It was also found that such a line would break even with revenue made from it covering the costs of constructing it.
The line was to be constructed from the present railhead at Murupara, across the Kaingaroa plains where it would sweep around the southern flank of Mt Tauhara in an arc like shape and then head north towards the Taupo industrial area before sweeping around in another arc in the Broadlands Road area and terminating at the Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. It was also suggested that there be a second stage to construct a line from the first stage line, near the State Highway 5 Napier - Taupo road through to Rangipo, so as to tap into forests in the Turangi area.
1985 proposal.
In 1985 Deputy General Manager of the New Zealand Railways Corporation, Bob Henare, stated that the proposed line would be a "no frills" style of railway with sharper curves and steeper grades so as to keep costs down. The line was to be a forestry style railway similar to the Murupara Branch, with its key role being to transport timber. Predicted increases in the number of logging trucks on public roads would also become a major problem when logging commenced in the region. He also said that the line would need to be constructed quickly as the rapidly maturing forests would not wait while people argued over whether or not to build the line. It was also intended for the line to be electrified from Taupo through to Mt Maunganui, once men who were at the time working on the electrification of the North Island Main Trunk, could be transferred on completion of the project. 
The 1985 proposal did not eventuate, but proposals to have the line extended to Taupo have been raised since that time, the last being in 1998.
1998 proposal.
In 1998 the findings of a study by consultants Woodward-Clyde for Environment Bay of Plenty, Environment Waikato, the Taupo District Council and Tranz Rail Limited were published to evaluate the various proposals to deal with transporting forestry products out of the Taupo region. The report stated that railheads could be accessed at Waiouru, National Park, Kinleith, and Murupara. The report said that it would be unlikely that rail connections would be made at National Park or Waiouru as the distance to forestry ports and processing plants would increase. A connection from Kinleith was a possibility but it would need to traverse difficult terrain and two crossings of the Waikato River may be needed. The report recommended an extension of the Murupara Branch line as being the best rail option.
The route recommended was similar to the 1985 proposal. The line would have traveled across the Kaingaroa Plains and followed the route more or less presently taken by the private forestry road, High Level Road. Stage one of the proposal would terminate at the junction between the two private forestry roads, High Level Road and the Off-Highway road leading from the Taupo Mill, near the State Highway 5 Napier-Taupo road. A recommendation was made that a log-processing yard be built at the junction of these two roads in conjunction with the rail line extension from Murupara.
The second stage of the proposal was to extend the line into the Taupo industrial area. The line would extend from the proposed log-processing yard around the southern flank of Mount Tauhara and head north towards Broadlands Road before completing a horseshoe like curve south into the Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. The report said the line would be used for transporting sawn timber from the processing yard to the mill on Centennial Drive. Forest industry people did not express an interest in this option, as they did not believe it would bring any new opportunities to them. 
The report concluded in respect to the rail options that Tranz Rail (now KiwiRail) and Fletcher Forests (now Tenon) would need to check the opportunities in extending a line south from the Murupara railhead. 
A roading option was consequently chosen and the rail proposal did not eventuate. The roading option involved a network of private forestry roads and did not use the proposed rail route.

Brad Knighton

Brad Knighton (born February 6, 1985 in Hickory, North Carolina) is an American soccer player who currently plays for New England Revolution in Major League Soccer.
Career.
College and amateur.
Knighton played four years of college soccer at UNC-Wilmington as well as for Indiana Invaders in the USL Premier Development League.
Professional.
Undrafted by Major League Soccer, he attended a New England Revolution tryout in early 2007 and was good enough to be invited on trial for the preseason. He impressed during the trial in Bermuda, winning a spot as the Revolution's third-choice keeper and a developmental contract with the club. The signing made him the first soccer player from UNC-Wilmington to be on a MLS roster.
After spending his first year and a half with the Revs behind Matt Reis and Doug Warren, he was loaned to the Portland Timbers on July 2, 2008 for the remainder of the 2008 Major League Soccer season. The move was aimed at getting Knighton some valuable playing time as he had seen no first team action while with New England.
Knighton was selected by Philadelphia Union in the 2009 MLS Expansion Draft on November 25, 2009. His first action with the team was a start in a friendly against Manchester United in which he allowed no goals before being replaced at halftime. He made his league debut for Philadelphia on August 8, 2010 against FC Dallas away, but was sent off for denying of an obvious goalscoring opportunity in 22nd minute. In his next start, he shut out the Chicago Fire at PPL Park on September 11, 2010, earning his first professional cleansheet, and also Philadelphia's first in franchise history. He was given a second consecutive start of the season vs. San Jose but was not able to hold down the starting position over the rest of the season, finishing with just 8 appearances.
On January 25, 2011, Knighton was waived by Philadelphia. In April 2011 he signed with Carolina RailHawks FC of the North American Soccer League.
Knighton signed with Vancouver Whitecaps FC of MLS in January 2012. After Joe Cannon, the starting goaltender for most of the season, had a blunder against the Portland Timbers in August 2012, Knighton established himself as the starting goalkeeper.
Honors.

Radiant (novel)

Radiant is a science fiction novel by the Canadian author James Alan Gardner. It was published in 2004 by HarperCollins Publishers under their Eos Books imprint. It is the seventh novel in Gardner's "League of Peoples" series. Like the six preceding novels, "Radiant" is set in the middle of the 25th century; like most of them, it takes place in outer space and on alien planets, and features the continuing character Festina Ramos.
Backstory.
In keeping with the series as a whole, "Radiant" shares the same backstory and conceptual background as the earlier books. Humanity has moved into the galaxy: based on a terraformed and bio-engineered New Earth, a human society called the Technocracy has developed an advanced, multi-planet, space-travelling society. The Technocracy explores space and colonizes new planets through its navy-like Outward Fleet and its Explorer Corps. Youn Suu, the novel's protagonist and first-person narrator, is a member of that Corps, as are the majority of the protagonists in Gardner's series. The Technocracy exists under the aegis of the League of Peoples, an umbrella organization of highly advanced alien beings that enforces a galactic peace and controls fatal violence against sentient beings in interstellar space.
In "Radiant," Gardner develops hints in the earlier books of a more complex picture of the human future. Specifically, he delineates an offshoot of Technocracy society that calls itself Unity. In the Technocracy, genetic modification of human beings is severely limited (though the limits are regularly violated on an individual and black market basis), while the Unity has embraced genetic modification as their way of life. The novel also employs alien species introduced in prior books: the Cashlings (from "Ascending"), the Greenstriders (from "Expendable" and "Vigilant"), the Fuentes (from "Ascending"), and most notably, from "Hunted," the form of sentient red moss nicknamed "the Balrog" (an obvious and Gardner-acknowledged borrowing from J. R. R. Tolkien). In "Hunted," a supporting character is infected with the red moss in a symbiotic relationship; in that novel, Festina Ramos describes the moss as "Grossly intelligent...marginally telepathic and telekinetic...possibly precognitive..." ("Hunted," chapter 16; ellipses in the original). Experience shows that the moss is far more powerful and formidable than Festina then guessed (scratch the "marginally" and "possibly"). In "Radiant," the protagonist Youn Suu is infested with the Balrog, with extreme consequences.
Buddhism.
In "Radiant," concepts from Buddhism play an important role: Youn Suu is a Buddhist from a planet settled by Buddhists; each chapter is prefaced by a Buddhist term and its definition. Gardner makes interesting connections between the traditional religion and one of the most basic preoccupations of his series, the idea of the evolution of biological life beyond the physical plane of existence. In Gardner's universe, alien species tend to go through an identifiable sequence of development—their "space-exploration phase, their bio-engineering phase, their evolution into immortal energy-beings phase..." ("Vigilant," chapter 17; ellipsis in the original). The implication is that humanity can follow the same arc of development—an implication that is stronger in "Radiant" than in any of its predecessors. The traditional Buddhist concept of individual spiritual development till the attainment of Nirvana dovetails neatly with this fictional idea.
In the Author's Note that prefaces "Radiant", Gardner specifies that he is not "preaching" Buddhism, but rather employing the religion to give his character a "multiplicity" of viewpoints on their world and their experience. Through much of the novel, the reader has varied access to the views of three different characters—Youn Suu, Festina Ramos, and a character known only by the nickname Tut, the three Explorers who do the novel's exploring. Ramos is a pragmatic realist, while Tut is a crazy person with a gold-plated face and penis. If Youn Suu embodies an Eastern take on the story's events, Ramos and Tut can be taken to represent the polar opposites of the Western mind. Some would use the terms left-brain (Ramos) and right-brain (Tut), while a classicist might prefer Apollonian versus Dionysian; there are many other pairs of terms that have been proposed for the same basic concepts. Interestingly, all three of these orientations are needed for the story's successful conclusion.
Plot summary.
At the start of the story, Youn Suu is a rookie Explorer on her first assignment in interstellar space. Like most Explorers, she suffers from a significant physical deformity—in her case, a facial blemish that has been left untreated to "qualify" her for the Explorer Corps. Her first assignment, with her partner Tut, is to investigate a sudden infestation of the Balrog in a domed city on the home world of the Cashlings. While there, she is herself infested by the red moss. At the same time, Youn Suu and Tut encounter Admiral Festina Ramos, present on a mission of her own.
Aboard an Outward fleet starship, Youn Suu is monitored medically, though there is no cure for her condition and no real treatment. The Balrog, far more than a parasite, is a hive mind well above the human level of development, so that killing it would violate the central precept of the League of Peoples. As its symbiotic relationship with its human host develops, the Balrog comes to share the mental functioning of its host, and prolongs the host's life while consuming her body—"her" because the only prior human host was also female (and also a Buddhist). Youn Suu is also exposed to potential exploitation, by people who want to use the Balrog's special abilities for their own purposes. Meanwhile, Ramos and the other explorers are called to an emergency rescue on a planet called Muta, where Unity survey teams have suddenly disappeared, with barely a peep of a distress signal.
The planet Muta, temperate and Earth-like, is to outward appearances almost ideal for colonization; yet colonizing efforts by the Unity, and the Greenstriders, and perhaps others, have mysteriously failed. The three Explorers land on the planet; even with the most elaborate precautions they fall prey to its peculiar circumstances, and find themselves stranded and contaminated with a microbe that threatens to destroy their bodies.
Investigating their predicament, they learn that the entire planet was once a global research station for the Fuentes, a species that discovered a way to transcend the physical body and transform itself into energy-based or consciousness-based entities. The research done by the Fuentes on Muta 6500 years earlier had been in pursuit of that goal—but had gone horribly wrong, dooming Fuentes and Greenstrider and Unity individuals to a disembodied but tortuous existence. While being hunted by raptor-like reptiles, the three Explorers must find a way to repair alien technology to reverse the damage, before their own bodies collapse.
