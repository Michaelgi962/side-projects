2012 Nehru Cup Final

The 2012 Nehru Cup Final was a match that took place on 2 September 2012 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi, India between India and Cameroon. India won the match in the penalty shoot out 5-4 after the match ended 2–2 after 120 minutes. India became the winner for the third successive time.
The teams during the tournament.
India entered the tournament as reigning champions after winning the 2009 Nehru Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium. However they also came into the tournament following an all defeat performance at the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup but they also came into the tournament with an added optimism as India got a new head coach in Dutchman Wim Koevermans.
Cameroon on the other hand came in with an all-domestic line-up which meant regular players who play abroad like Alex Song would not play in the tournament. Also current head coach of Cameroon, Denis Lavagne, would not be attending the tournament, leaving assistant coach, Emmanuel Bosso to become temporary head coach for the Nehru Cup.
India opened the tournament with a victory against Syria by beating them 2–1. They followed that victory up with a 3–1 victory over Maldives on 25 August. India then followed that match with a draw against Nepal on 28 August. India finished the group stage campaign with a loss against Cameroon in a match that did not matter as both teams were already through to the Final.
Cameroon opened their Nehru Cup campaign on 24 August playing out a draw against Syria 2–2. Cameroon then went back on track to the final by defeating Nepal 5–0 continuing their good form against Maldives by defeating them 3–1. Cameroon then finished their group stage with a victory over India 1-0.

Gatineau River Yacht Club

The Gatineau River Yacht Club (GRYC) is located on Gatineau River in Chelsea, Quebec, Canada. The club is based on two small islands connected by a pontoon bridge. GRYC is celebrating its 50th Anniversary in 2012.
History.
After farmland on both sides of the Gatineau River was flooded in 1926, hills were turned into islands. The road off the Gleneagle Road leading to the walkway of the Gatineau River Yacht Club is named Summerlea, which was the name of the region until it was changed to Gleneagle in the 1930s.
The club was officially opened on Sept. 2, 1962, with an initial membership of five Chelsea residents: Gerry Byers, Pat Evans, Ivan Herbert, Allan Richens and John Winfield and a fleet of their five boats. The Club's first Commodore was Ivan Herbert. Pat Evans, one of the club's founders, served as the club historian. The original clubhouse was a small white cottage at the bottom of Gleneagle Road, off Route 105, which was rented in the spring of 1963. The initial membership chose the club’s blue and white burgee with 'G R Y C' surrounding a circle of rope, with an anchor at the center. The initial club fees were set at $5 a year. By 1964, with a membership of 100 people, the club purchases an island for $12,000 near the site of the Club's floating dock. The club consisted of two islands connected by a walkway, complete with cottage and two sleeping cabins. The Gatineau Boom Company donated lumber for a walkway to the island.
The GRYC island clubhouse, which resembles a pinecone, was designed by James Strutt based on the Rhombic dodecahedron. Club members provided the labour and often donated the supplies. Club members erected the three-level clubhouse on a rocky hillside, out of a wood frame, plywood sheathing, and ribbed metal the colour of tree trunks during the summer and fall of 1978 for $21,000
The Yacht Club hosts social events such as sleigh drives, tea and fashion shows, and "Hawaiian Night" theme parties, Box Socials. The club hosted the National Centennial Junior Sailing Championships in 1967 and an annual CJOH Regatta.
Club members Ed Quipp and Pat Evans built the original lighthouse, which was delivered to the island by pontoon barge. The lighthouse was destroyed in 1986 during a windstorm, which also uprooted about 60 trees on the island. The lighthouse and trees were replaced.
"Richens Point" on the main island, was named in honour of GRYC founder Allan Richens.
Mission Statement.
The Club's mission statement is "The Gatineau River Yacht Club (GRYC) is a family-oriented, volunteer-driven, co-operative, not-for-profit corporation dedicated to promoting and encouraging active participation in the sport of sailing and other water-related recreational activities. All activities at the GRYC shall respect the environment and the ability of the Club's islands and of the Gatineau River to sustain those activities on a long term basis." 
Features.
The main areas include: hand and vehicle launch ramps; island clubhouse, Registration, Office and Washrooms; changing facilities, kitchen, main club room, first aid, parking and dock access. A “crow’s nest” at the peak of the island clubhouse serves as a playroom for children.
Life at the Club.
Enrollment.
Membership today is almost 400 members, mainly from the Gleneagle and Chelsea areas. The Yacht Club's fleet is eighty-three craft, from canoes to cabin cruisers. The club maintains its emphasis on sailing. The club also maintains an active dry sail program for day-sailing.
Programs.
The sailing season extends from Mid April to late October. Sail training programs are active during the summer months for both youth and adults. The GRYC offers a children's summer camp and runs social events. The annual awards ceremony for the juniors took place each year around Labour Day.
Every year the club hosts sailing regattas that attract sailors from across Canada. The local racing scene consists of fleet, PY and PHRF races along with special racing events on weekends throughout the season. Many racing events are held in cooperation with the nearby Britannia Yacht Club and Club de voile Grande-Rivière.
Wildlife.
For birdwatchers, species in or passing through the area include Arctic Tern, Black Tern, New World blackbirds, Black Brant, Canada geese, Common Goldeneye, Common Merganser, Common Tern, Double-crested Cormorants, Great Blue Heron, Green-winged Teal, Gulls, Killdeer, Northern Pintails, Rails, Red-throated Loon, Ring-billed Gull, Songbirds, Spotted Sandpiper, Swallows, and Wood Ducks.

<doc id="36885154" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36885154" title="I Cry (Flo Rida song)">
I Cry (Flo Rida song)

"I Cry" is a song by American hip hop artist Flo Rida. The track was first released on September 18, 2012 as the fourth single from his fourth studio album, "Wild Ones". The song is based on Bingo Players' "Cry (Just a Little)" which samples "Piano in the Dark" by Brenda Russell. "I Cry" was produced by the French production duo soFLY & Nius and the Futuristics, and it was written by Flo Rida, The Futuristics, Scott Cutler, Jeffrey Hull, Brenda Russell, and soFLY & Nius.
"I Cry" received mixed reviews from music critics, who criticized its lyrical content and production, and stated that it would have been better with a collaboration with Sia Furler, who previously collaborated with Flo Rida on the song, "Wild Ones". However, some critics were positive towards its catchiness and club-nature. The song received commercial success upon its release, peaking inside the top ten in many countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States. A music video was released for the single on YouTube. This song is the second track on Now 45.
Critical reception.
"I Cry" received generally mixed reviews from most music critics. Andy Gill from "The Independent" said that this track, along with "In My Mind (Part 2)" are "galloping grooves." Chris Payne from "Billboard" was favorable saying "After repeat listens "I Cry" might sound a good deal like the rest of "Wild Ones," but played in a club at the right time, it's got enough building beats and poppy climaxes to deliver." AbsolutePunk said that "I Cry" was a "decent dance cut, using a sample from the Bingo Players for the hook."
However, Melissa Maerz from "Entertainment Weekly" said, "Most bizarre is "I Cry," which speeds up Brenda Russell's 1988 smooth-jazz cheesefest "Piano in the Dark" until it has all the emotional heft of an LMFAO track. You couldn't program a robot to cry to it." Gleen Glomboa from Newsday said the sample of "Piano in the Dark" was "off" and wanted it to "speed up a bit." Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave it a rather scathing review, only awarding it one star out of five. He stated "But 'I Cry' is just sheer laziness [...] Flo waxes the usual lyrical nonsense about champagne buckets and his tattoo of Jimi Hendrix." Copsey also thought it would have been better as a collaboration with "Wild Ones" guest vocalist Sia Furler. He stated, "We've said it once and we'll say it again: Bring back Sia!"
Chart performance.
"I Cry" was a commercial success upon its release, performing particularly well in European countries. The song first charted in Norway, debuting at number 8 on the Norwegian Singles Chart and rising to number 1 the following week, where it lasted for three weeks in total. In Denmark, the song debuted at number 9 for the chart week ending September 7, 2012, and reached a peak of number 8 on September 16. "I Cry" also performed strongly in Ireland and the United Kingdom: it reached number 16 in Ireland on September 13, 2012, and reached a peak of number 3 on the UK Singles Chart for the chart week dated September 30, 2012.
In Australia, "I Cry" first appeared and peaked on the Australian Singles Chart at number 3 on September 16, 2012, remaining at that position for two weeks in total. The song peaked at number ten in New Zealand, debuting at number 17 on September 17, 2012 and rising to its peak position the following week.
Music video.
A music video for the song was released on September 30, 2012 directed by Marc Klasfeld. The video includes footage of Flo Rida visiting his home neighborhood in Carol City, Florida to tell his story of his struggle to fame and fortune while crying seeing the town's wealth. The music video premiered on BET's 106 & Park on October 11, 2012, when Flo Rida visited the show.

Alcatraz Library

Alcatraz Library was the library used by inmates of the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. It was located at the end of D-Block. Upon entering Alcatraz, every inmate was given a library card and a catalog of books found in the library; inmates could place orders by putting a slip with their card in a box at the entrance to the dining hall before breakfast, and the books would be delivered to and from their cell by a librarian. The library, which utilized a closed-stack paging system, had a collection of 10,000 to 15,000 books, mainly left over from the army days.
Inmates were permitted a maximum of three books in addition of up to 12 text books, a Bible, and a dictionary. They were permitted to subscribe to magazines but crime-related pages were torn out and newspapers were not prohibited. Sex, crime and violence were prohibited from all books and magazines, and the library was governed by a chaplain who regulated the censorship and the nature of the reading material to ensure that the material was wholesome. Failure to return books by the date given made the inmate liable to removal of privileges. A sign in the library today has an extract from the Federal Bureau of Prisons booklet in 1960 which says: "these men read more serious literature than does the ordinary person in the community. Philosophers such as Kant, Schopenhauer, Hegel, etc. are especially popular." Other authors include Jack London, Sinclair Lewis, Washington Irving, Zane Grey, Hamilton Garland, Alexandre Dumas, Daniel Defoe, Joseph Conrad, Cervantes and magazines such as "Adventure to Time", "Better Homes and Gardens" and "Library Digest". A law library was later added to A-Block.
A library scene in Alcatraz appeared in the 1979 Clint Eastwood film "Escape from Alcatraz" in which Eastwood's character of Frank Morris converses with another inmate.

USNS Schuyler Otis Bland (T-AK-277)

USNS "Schuyler Otis Bland" also known as SS "Schuyler Otis Bland" is the only ship of the series C3-S-DX1 (Freedom-class).
"Schuyler Otis Bland" was laid down, 9 May 1950, as a Maritime Commission type (C3-S-DX1), under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 2918), at Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, MS.
"Schuyler Otis Bland" was a prototype of the series C3-S-DX1 and what was to have been the "Bland class" of cargo ships, but Maritime Administration designers conceived of the even more modern "Mariner class" following her construction. Following the acquisition of MARCOM by United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) in 1950, the design was done as a C3-S-7. She was launched January 30, 1951, and delivered to the Maritime Commission July 25, 1951.
"Schuyler Otis Bland" was first assigned to the American President Lines under bareboat charter. She completed two round-the-world voyages before being transferred to the Waterman Steamship Corporation under a General Agency Agreement. On July 25, 1952, the C-3 cargo ship went into the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Mobile, Ala.
In 1957, "Schuyler Otis Bland" was acquired by the US Navy for operation by American Mail Lines. The American Mail Line had acquired her to replace the , which had foundered in a violent North Pacific storm. In October 1959, after more than two years with American Mail, she entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Olympia, Wash.
On August 4, 1961, "USNS Schuyler Otis Bland" was delivered to the Navy, and on August 28, assigned to the Military Sea Transport Service (MSTS) and placed in service as USNS "Schuyler Otis Bland" (T-AK-277). "USNS Schuyler Otis Bland" departed San Francisco on September 28, 1961, to carry cargo to Bangkok, Saigon, Manila, Kaohsiung, and other Pacific ports, beginning over a decade of service supplying military logistic requirements throughout the world.
Disposition.
On August 1, 1970, the Military Sea Transportation Service became Military Sealift Command. "Schuyler Otis Bland" was placed out of service in 1979 while at Guam. She was struck from the Naval Register, and transferred to MARAD for disposal. On November 28, 1979, she was sold for scrap to China Dismantled Vessel Trading Corporation, Kaohsiung, China for the price of $814,533.50
Logbook and Okinawa controversy.
The "Bland" was a civilian-owned ship regularly employed by the U.S. Navy to transport defoliants incognito and that was able to bypass customs inspections of military vessels entering foreign ports. The logbook of "USNS Schuyler Otis Bland" was re-discovered by Michelle Gatz in 2012 and shows that the ship was carrying classified cargo that was offloaded under armed guard at White Beach, a U.S. Navy port on Okinawa’s east coast on April 25, 1962. Three months prior to its arrival at Okinawa, the "Bland" had traveled to South Vietnam to deliver one of the Pentagon’s first shipments of defoliants. The account in the ships logbook states the classified cargo was labeled "agriculture products." The ships cargo was documented to include herbicide Agents Pink and Purple for covert tests in Southeast Asia. The experiments, believed to have taken place under the auspices of Project AGILE — a classified program to research unconventional warfare techniques. The implications of the ship's log re-discovery are profound.
The cargo is now believed by researchers to be biological or chemical anti-crop agents effective against rice from Fort Detrick for use in trials and research-related activities on Okinawa or in the CIA-linked Special Forces counterinsurgency training area operating on Okinawa at the time. After departing Okinawa in spring 1962, "Bland" sailed to the Panama Canal Zone where, the Panamanian government asserts, the U.S. tested agents in the early 1960s. In May 1962, the Army Special Forces counter-insurgency school which was moved from Vietnam opened in Okinawa. According to Army Field Manual FM 31-15,"Operations Against Irregular Forces", May 1961, 
The late author Sheldon H. Harris in his book "Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932-1945, and the American Cover Up" wrote the test program, which began in fall 1962 was aimed at both human, animal, and plant reaction to Biological Warfare. It is known that tests were undertaken in Japan’s satellite province of Okinawa.

Men Against Sexual Trafficking

Men Against Sexual Trafficking (MAST) is a London, Ontario, Canada-based organisation that opposes human trafficking by educating men on the issue and encouraging them to stop buying sexual services provided by human trafficking victims. It was founded by Stan Burditt. Membership in the organisation is not restricted by sex, age, ethnic group, or religion. In 2011, two weeks after the Western Fair District denied The Everything to do with Sex Show a lease to their Progress Building, MAST appeared with two other organisations, the London Abused Women's Centre and Stop Porn Culture, before the Community and Neighbourhoods Committee of the London City Council to ask the London Public Library to stop pornography from being viewable on public computers and to ask the city to ban pornography-industry organisations from holding events in city-funded venues. The committee did not allow these three organisations' presentation to be on the public agenda; only the committee members saw the presentation. The presentation convinced the committee to support the two proposed courses of action. Mental health professional Dan Lenart opposed the proposal to put content-control software on computers in public libraries, calling the software an "attack on the poor and impoverished". In 2012, MAST partnered with the London Anti-Human Trafficking Committee to host a human trafficking seminar called "One Voice One Hope", and later to host the 2012 London performances of Andrew Kooman's "She Has a Name", a play about sexual trafficking.

In the early 2000's Mila took a hiatus from the music industry, commenting on this Mila said due to being in a variety of girl groups, she did not know who she was as an "artist," during her hiatus Mila said she discovered her artistry saying "I definitely think I was able to take that time off and really figure out who I was as a solo artist and what I wanted to talk about, what I wanted to address, be myself, basically. It was a break because I was in the industry for a minute."

Stetson, Street Dog of Park City

Stetson, Street Dog of Park City is a short film released in 2012 and adapted from the children's book written by Jeanine Heil. The storyline deals with the plight of homeless animals and the film is shown locally to encourage the adoption of abandoned animals. A portion of the film's proceeds are donated to Second Chance for Homeless Pets in Salt Lake City, Utah, which served as a halfway house for Stetson's permanent adoption.
A small terrier with aggressiveness issues, who had been rescued from the streets of Park City, was chosen to play the part of Stetson. The rescued dog (now named Stetson) had the good fortune of resembling Kristina Skarstedt's illustrations of Stetson included within the children's book.
Plot.
Because he is small, Stetson, a tan and brown terrier, has been abandoned in favor of a larger hunting dog. Stetson finds himself alone on the streets of the winter ski town, Park City, Utah, in search of food, shelter and a new home. Because he is small, Stetson can hide under the steps of Alex's Bistro, from between the steps, Stetson watches the sun set behind the Wasatch Mountains, the activities about the town and the dinner crowd leaving the bistro into the evening snowfall.
The next morning, Stetson is awoken by the sounds of skiers preparing to enjoy a fresh blanket of snow. Because he is small, Stetson has to avoid people and ski boots, walking the freshly shoveled paths through the snow. As Stetson trots down Main Street and past Dolly’s Bookstore, the smell of freshly cooked bacon leads him to the Morning Ray Cafe. Stetson patiently waits outside, hoping that somebody will share their breakfast with him. Finally, a man in fire-red ski boots shares his croissant and pats Stetson on the head.
Behind the cafe, Stetson finds his friend Sam, a Golden Retriever, and then wanders over to his favorite snow cave; because he is small, the snow cave is just the right size. Stetson continues on to Love Your Pet Bakery, which is owned by three giant Newfoundland dogs, Ferguson, Apollo and Atlas. The lady at the counter gives Stetson a treat and he wanders upstairs, to an area where they sell custom dog collars. He sidles up to a customer, hoping that she needs a tan and brown terrier. Stetson tries on an orange collar, but none of the nice people give him collar or a home.
Stetson then rides the Park City Trolley, seated near his friend the Mayor (Mayor Dana Williams). Stetson and the Mayor like to ride the trolley because the people are nice, Stetson also likes to ride high in his seat to see the colorful and historic mining era buildings of Park City and so that he doesn’t have to look at feet.
Stetson takes the Park City Trolley to Dolly’s Bookstore, which looks warm and inviting, Stetson picks his moment to sneak inside. Two cats, Mr. Dolly and Che own Dolly’s Bookstore and they don’t appreciate his visit on this evening. Stetson tries to disguise himself, hiding in a pile of stuffed animals, but Mr. Dolly really does not want Stetson in his store today. Stetson finds another place to hide in a cowboy hat shaped cat bed. Because he is small, Stetson can just fit into the bed and he falls asleep. At children’s story time, the bookstore gets busy and very noisy, Stetson heads into the evening looking for food and warmth.
As the night grows colder, icicles form on the buildings and on Stetson’s beard. Wandering up Main Street looking for food, Stetson meets a nice lady (Kristina Skarstedt) and a little girl, Stetson also meets a not so nice person (Vicky Bushnell) who chases him away.
Stetson is soon drawn to music coming from the open doors of St. Mary’s Church. Stetson scoots into the church, and because he is small, he can crawl forward under the pews, settling beneath a man with a red scarf and a Stetson cowboy hat. At the end of the Service, Stetson follows the man with the hat into the blustery evening. A gust of wind whips the hat from the man’s hand and it comes to rest beneath a parked snowplow. A snow covered Stetson retrieves the hat and returns it to the man. The man picks up the hat and then he picks up Stetson, because he is small, the man is able to warm Stetson with the red scarf and carries him to his new home.
The man’s name is John (Dr. John Artz), he is Ski Patrol in Park City. And now, Stetson will learn to be a ski Patrol dog. Because he is small, Stetson can ride in John’s backpack as they travel the mountains helping to keep skiers and snowboarders safe.
Themes.
The protagonist (Stetson) is small in stature and this fact is promoted throughout the narrative with the sentence preposition, "Because he was small..." Anticipating that most children will empathize with the central character's small stature as a liability. Following the story's turning point, the narrative emphasizes that being small in stature can also be an asset.
"Stetson, Street Dog of Park City" brings the book to life with the use of illustrations and a narrative from the book. The film takes the viewer on a tour of the historic mining town of Park City, Utah with Lesley Ann Fogle narrating and with a young Silas Beuhrig as the voice of Stetson, the tan and brown terrier.
Production.
Development.
As an adaption from the children's book, "Stetson, Street Dog of Park City", the script's theme develops empathy for the abandoned dog by using the narrative, "because he was small". Children may self-identify with being small in stature as a liability, the story's happy ending notes that being small in stature can also be an asset.
Funding for "Stetson, Street Dog of Park City" was provided by the film's Producer, Nancy Ogden, in partnership with the The Park City Foundation. Proceeds from the sale of "Stetson, Street Dog of Park City" also benefit The Park City Foundation and Second Chance for Homeless Pets.
Pre-production.
Tonya Landon, of Diamonds in the Ruff Dog Services, was tasked with finding a dog that resembles the illustrations of Stetson in the book. After looking at hundreds of dogs, Landon found the terrier at the Second Chance for Homeless Pets and was informed that the dog was aggressive; the fact that this dog was found roaming the streets of Park City was a coincidence. Landon was optimistic that she could work with the dog and took him because he had the look. Landon describes the dog's aggressive traits as "severe issues," which were overcome and Landon now describes the dog as, " a great little boy." The training for "Stetson" and filming took about two years.
Production.
On the first day of shooting, the star of the film wandered off to revisit familiar surroundings, the entire film crew chased Stetson around the town of Park City, hoping that their investment in the film had not just walked away.
"Stetson, Street Dog of Park City" is a tour of the community's child friendly shops and activities; narrated from the perspective of a small dog.
"Stetson, Street Dog of Park City" is set and filmed entirely in Park City.
Many scenes were filmed at knee-level to simulate a dog's eye perspective for the film; additionally, the winter setting compounded difficulty for the camera crew as their clothing became wet in the daytime and filming often continued into the evenings. Many of the conveniences of larger budget films were unavailable, for instance, a skateboard was used as a camera-dolly for a scene where Stetson crawls forward under the church pews.
Post Production.
The voice actors for "Stetson, Street Dog of Park City", Lesley Ann Fogle (narrator) and Silas Beuhrig (the voice of Stetson) worked together Dayton, Ohio. Nancy Ogden directed Fogle and Beuhrig from her location in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts

He is a member of the New Democratic Party and is the Official Opposition's National Revenue and Pensions Critic, in Canada's 41st parliament.
Background.
Rankin was born in Belleville, Ontario, the only male of five children, to Eleanore, a school teacher, and McKinley Rankin, a teacher and insurance agent. He went on to university on scholarships, grants and loans, completing his undergrad at Queen's University and the Université de Montréal and law degrees from the University of Toronto and Harvard University where he graduated summa cum laude with a Masters degree in law.
Rankin is a founding member and former president of the British Columbia Public Interest Advocacy Centre (BCPIAC), an NGO that provides legal services to marginalized groups in British Columbia. He is also former president of West Coast Environmental Law, past chairman of The Land Conservancy of British Columbia where he helped protect the Sooke Potholes, and co-chair of the Environmental Law Centre at the University of Victoria, a student-run legal clinic doing public interest work in environmental law.
Rankin is a vegetarian, lives in Victoria, British Columbia and is married to Linda Hannah, whom he met at a founding board meeting of the Western Canada Wilderness Committee. They have two children, Benjamin and Mark.
Academic and Legal career.
Rankin has fought for gay marriage rights in B.C., acted for governments, industry and First Nations on groundbreaking aboriginal land issues, and has taken a lead role on major environmental court cases in areas like sewage treatment, contaminated sites and environmental assessment. Rankin has appeared before all levels of court in British Columbia and in the Supreme Court of Canada. Rankin was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1999. He has been listed in "Best Lawyers" since 2006 as well as in both "Chambers Global 2012", a influential UK-based legal directory, where he is listed as a leading lawyer worldwide in the field of environmental law and in "Lexpert" where he is named as an expert in aboriginal law.
Law Professor.
After finishing graduate school at Harvard Law School, Rankin taught the at the University of Victoria as a Professor of Law until 1990. Rankin returned to the law school in 2004 to teach part-time as an adjunct professor of law, donating his salary to charity.
OECD.
While at Harvard Law School Rankin did his graduate thesis on freedom of information and national security matters. A variation of his thesis was published by the Canadian Bar Association in its efforts to lobby for federal legislation.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris in the Directorate of Science Technology and Industry on Transborder Information Flows and subsequently wrote about this in several publications. Rankin was later integrally involved in the consultations leading up to the enactment of the federal Access to Information Act. For his efforts he received the House of Commons Award of Merit for his contributions to the development of freedom of information.
Rankin was later retained as a special advisor to Colin Gabelmann, the former Attorney General of British Columbia and was a key architect of BC’s own Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.
Law Practice.
In 1990, Rankin joined up with his friends Joseph Arvay to become managing partner for the boutique law firm Arvay Finlay. In 1994, Murray Rankin was appointed by Premier Mike Harcourt as the lead treaty negotiator for the province of British Columbia.
As treaty negotiator for the Province of British Columbia Rankin negotiated the first Agreement in Principle under the auspices of the British Columbia Treaty Commission with the Sechelt Indian Band. He also represented the Blueberry River First Nations in the negotiation of the first Economic Benefits Agreement relating to natural resources revenues in British Columbia. He also advised BC Hydro in the landmark agreement with two tribal councils related to the construction of the Lower Mainland Transmission Project. Rankin also successfully defended B.C. Forest Appeals Commission’s jurisdiction in aboriginal rights case before Supreme Court of Canada (2003).
Rankin joined the national firm of Heenan Blaikie in 2006 as a partner in their Victoria office. He left the law firm in 2011 in order to pursue an independent practice that focused on environmental, aboriginal and public law.
National Security law.
Rankin is designated a Special Advocate, appointed by the federal Minister of Justice to protect the interests of persons named in security certificates during hearings from which persons named in these certificates and their own lawyers are excluded due to national security concerns. Rankin, an expert on national security issues, is the only Special Advocate in Canada residing in British Columbia. He has been regional editor of the "Canadian Journal of Administrative Law and Practice" since its inception.
Political career.
Rankin's first entry into politics was as a volunteer for Stephen Lewis, the leader of the Ontario NDP. Rankin has since acted as an advisor to successive leaders of the BC NDP. When the BC NDP was in power in the 1990s, he helped shape public policy initiatives on access to information, treaty negotiations, land use, environmental policy, and justice. Rankin also advised BC NDP Opposition Leaders on public policy. Rankin led the NDP legal team to oppose the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines. He argued that British Columbia should withdraw from the federal government’s review process and set up a "made-in-B.C." environmental assessment that ensures BC's economic, social, environmental, and aboriginal interests are fully addressed.
In the early 2000s Rankin was asked to seek the BC NDP leadership. Rankin never entered the race, because of the young age of his two sons, and the contest was eventually won by Carole James. Rankin was also a founding member of Tom Mulcair's British Columbia campaign committee during the 2012 New Democratic Party leadership election.
2012 federal by-election.
On September 9, 2012 Rankin announced his intention to seek the NDP nomination to become the federal Member of Parliament for Victoria following Denise Savoie's retirement.
The Victoria by-election was held on November 26, 2012. It was contested by Green Party's Donald Galloway, the Conservative Dale Gann, and Liberal Paul Summerville. The Libertarian and Christian Heritage parties also ran candidates. Rankin won the election with 37.2% of the vote. In his victory speech, Rankin told the crowd he would continue to work to stop the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines, stating that, ""we will not let this country become the energy Wal-Mart of the World.""
First Term.
Rankin was officially sworn into office on December 11, 2012. Tom Mulcair immediately named Rankin to a senior role in his shadow cabinet, putting him in charge of criticizing the government over offshore tax evasion as National Revenue Critic. On January 28, 2013 Rankin was appointed to the Standing Committee on Finance, which reviews fiscal and monetary policy. Mulcair has pointed to Rankin as one of his rising stars and top recruits.
In his role as National Revenue Critic, Rankin has been outspoken on the Conservative government's failure to tackle the issue of tax havens and tax evasion, which he argues puts an unfair burden on honest Canadians. He criticized layoffs at the Canada Revenue Agency which investigates tax fraud and supported the efforts of Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page to measure the tax gap that were ultimately blocked by the Conservative Party. A CBC and ICIJ investigation later revealed a massive data leak which proved that hundreds of Canadians were exploiting tax havens, including Liberal Senator Pana Merchant. On August 8th, 2013 Tom Mulcair added responsibility for Pensions to Rankin's critic portfolio.
Throughout his first term, Rankin has become one of the NDP’s go-to critics, drawing on decades of legal expertise in areas ranging from aboriginal treaty negotiations and environment protection to national security. Weeks after being sworn in as Member of Parliament, Rankin was barred from entering the Federal government's "public hearing" on the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines in his Victoria constituency. Speaking to press outside the hearing Rankin said, ""I wanted to observe on behalf of my constituents… I’ve never heard of a public hearing that was not open to the public … It’s Kafkaesque.”" Adding, ""I’m opposed to the pipeline and I don’t mind admitting it.”" Rankin was selected to address the 2013 NDP Convention where he told delegates that ""the NDP's leadership on the environment has always been a beacon to those of us who have fought to protect our environment and tackle the climate crisis head on.""

7th Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)

The 7th Cavalry Brigade was a cavalry brigade of the British Army. It served in the Napoleonic Wars, notably at the Battle of Waterloo. It was reformed in 1914 and served on the Western Front as part of the 3rd Cavalry Division until the end of World War I. 
Napoleonic Wars.
The 7th Cavalry Brigade was formed for the Waterloo Campaign in 1815 and consisted of 
It was commanded by Colonel Sir Friedrich von Arentschildt. 
The brigade took part in the Battle of Waterloo, though the 13th Light Dragoons was detached to the 5th Cavalry Brigade. Stationed to the rear of the infantry squares, it helped to fend off Ney's massed cavalry attacks from 4pm onwards. During the battle, the Hussars suffered 130 casualties (44 killed, 86 wounded) and the Light Dragoons 108 (12 killed, 78 wounded, 18 missing). This represented a loss rate of about 20%.
World War I.
Formation.
The brigade was formed on 1 September 1914 at Ludgershall, Wiltshire for the 3rd Cavalry Division. It commanded the three Household Cavalry regiments, the only regular cavalry regiments remaining in the United Kingdom after mobilization of the BEF and its transport to France. A Royal Engineers signal troop also joined on formation.
The 1st Life Guards joined from Hyde Park, the 2nd Life Guards from Regent's Park and the Royal Horse Guards from Windsor. Each regiment only consisted of two squadrons as each had provided a squadron to the Household Cavalry Composite Regiment in 4th Cavalry Brigade in August 1914. The detached squadrons did not rejoin their parent regiments until 11 November 1914.
The brigade landed at Zeebrugge on 7 October 1914 and deployed to the Western Front in France and Belgium. K Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (six 13 pounders) joined the division's Royal Horse Artillery Brigade from VI Brigade, RHA at Christchurch on 1 October and was permanently attached to 7th Cavalry Brigade on 16 October. On 29 February 1916, a Machine Gun Squadron was formed from the machine gun sections of the brigade's constituent regiments.
The 3rd Cavalry Division was initially formed with just two cavalry brigades – the 6th and 7th. To bring the division up to the standard strength of three brigades, the 8th Cavalry Brigade was formed in Belgium on 20 November 1914. The Royal Horse Guards was transferred to the new brigade on 21 November and was replaced by the Leicestershire Yeomanry from the North Midland Mounted Brigade in England.
Reconstituted.
In March 1918, the 4th (formerly 1st Indian) and 5th (formerly 2nd Indian) Cavalry Divisions were broken up in France. The Indian elements were sent to Egypt where they formed part of the new 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions which played a major part in the successful conclusion of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The British and Canadian units remained in France and most of them were transferred to the 3rd Cavalry Division causing it to be extensively reorganized.
The Household Cavalry regiments were concentrated in the 7th Cavalry Brigade; they left the brigade on 10 March when they were dismounted and converted to machine gunners as No. 1 (1st Life Guards), No. 2 (2nd Life Guards) and No. 3 (Royal Horse Guards) Battalions of the Guards Machine Gun Regiment at Étaples. They were replaced in the brigade on the same day by 7th Dragoon Guards, 6th Dragoons and 17th Lancers.
Chronicle.
The brigade served with the 3rd Cavalry Division on the Western Front until the end of the war. In 1914, the division saw action in the defence of Antwerp (9 and 10 October) and the First Battle of Ypres, notably the battles of Langemarck (21–24 October), Gheluvelt (29–31 October) and Nonne Bosschen (11 November). In 1915, it took part in the Second Battle of Ypres (Battle of Frezenberg Ridge, 11–13 May) and the Battle of Loos (26–28 September). 1916 saw no notable actions, but in 1917 the division saw action in the Battle of Arras (First Battle of the Scarpe, 9–12 April). At other times, the brigade formed a dismounted unit and served in the trenches (as a regiment under the command of the brigadier).
1918 saw the return of the war of movement and the division took part in the First Battle of the Somme notably the Battle of St Quentin (21–23 March), Actions of the Somme Crossings (24 and 25 March) and Battle of the Avre (4 and 5 April); the Battle of Amiens and the battles of the Hindenburg Line (Battle of Cambrai, 8 and 9 October and the Pursuit to the Selle, 9–12 October). Its final action was in the Advance in Flanders (9–11 November).
At the Armistice, units of the division had reached the River Dender at Leuze and Lessines in Belgium, when orders were received that they would cover the advance of the Second Army into Germany. They started the advance on 17 November, divisional headquarters being established at Waterloo on 21 November. Transport difficulties meant that the only one cavalry division could advance with Second Army so the following winter was spent in Belgium. By 31 March 1919, the division was demobilized.
Commanders.
The 7th Cavalry Brigade had the following commanders:

Chester A. Dolan, Jr.

Chester A. Dolan, Jr. was an American politician who served as President of the Massachusetts Senate in 1949.
Early life.
Dolan was born on September 20, 1907 in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. He attended Lowell Grammar School, High School of Commerce, Harvard Extension School, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Suffolk University Law School. Prior to entering politics, Dolan was a semi-pro baseball player.
Political career.
Dolan served one term in the Massachusetts House of Representatives before being elected to the Massachusetts Senate in 1938. Dolan was named Democratic Floor Leader in 1941, but gave up that position to serve in the United States Army. Dolan resigned from the House on August 18, 1942 and enlisted in the Army Air Corps. He was assigned to intelligence and after attending officers training school, was sworn in as a lieutenant and assigned to the Twelfth Air Force.
On November 8, Dolan and his outfit participated in the first Allied invasion of Casablanca along with General George S. Patton's Western Tank Force. He was part of Allied campaigns in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. In 1945, while fighting outside Bologna, Dolan was injured. He was hospitalized and sent back to the United States. He was discharged in January 1946 with the rank of Major.
Although Dolan had resigned from the House, his name was already on the primary ballot for the 1942 election and the state Ballot Law Commission ruled that it could not be removed. He won the primary in and was reelected to the Senate while still in the Army. In 1944 he was reelected while serving in the European theater. He was once again appointed Democratic Floor Leader in 1947.
Senate Presidency.
The 1948 Massachusetts Senate elections resulted in the election of 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats. The Republicans proposed an arrangement in which each party would have control over the Senate for half of the term. Dolan and the Democrats refused to accept this proposal, stating that after the election of a Democratic Governor, a Democratic majority in the State House of Representatives, and an increased number of Democratic State Senators "If the Republican leaders have not heard the voice of the people by this time they must be deaf." The Senate met for the first time at 11 am on January 5, 1949. The adjourned at 3:45 am the next day, still deadlocked after record 33 ballots. The stalemate finally ended on January 27 after 114 total ballots when the two sides agreed to have Dolan serve as President in 1949 and Harris S. Richardson serve in 1950. As part of the agreement, the Democrats received a majority on the Senate Ways and Means Committee for the full two years and all of the Republican-appointed employees of the Senate were assured of their jobs.
Later life and death.
In 1950, Dolan was appointed clerk of the Suffolk County division of the Supreme Judicial Court. In 1955 he was a candidate for Mayor of Boston. He finished fourth in the preliminary election behind John B. Hynes, John E. Powers, and James Michael Curley. In 1964 he resigned his position as clerk to become Chief Executive Officer of the Guaranty Trust Company in Waltham, Massachusetts. He later served as president and chief executive officer of WORL Radio and Cranberry Corp. and was president of Pinewood Corp.
Dolan died on September 7, 1994 in Wareham, Massachusetts.

Alan Sepinwall compared it to the pilot episode, stating ""News Night 2.0" unfortunately magnified many of the problems I had with that first episode, while losing some of the elements (Mac being in complete command even in such an untenable situation, the staff coming together to do a kick-ass newscast) I had liked the most."

Denys Irving

Denys George Irving (1944-1976), was born on 4 January 1944 in Colwyn Bay, North Wales.
He grew up in South London and was educated at Dulwich College (1954–1961), where he was awarded the Fawkes Memorial Scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford (1962), where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. After graduating in 1966 he went on to study at the London School of Economics, and was a graduate student in the Philosophy Ph.D. program at Columbia University, New York.
Whilst at Columbia in 1968, Denys was actively involved in student politics, notably during the student demonstrations in May, when he was prominent among a large number of students who occupied Fairweather Hall.
It was at Columbia that Denys became interested in artificial intelligence and started working with computers. In December 1968 he wrote to his parents: "I have been working with computers this term and I have made pretty good progress so far and my plan is to try to get accepted by the Royal College of Art (film department) to do research into computer generated research and music." He acknowledged that "the chances (of being accepted) are pretty slim." (This assessment proved correct and Denys’s application to the Film School was rejected. Perhaps what he was trying to do was a bit too avant-garde for the film establishment of the time).
Using Columbia University’s mainframe computer he developed programs to produce short computer generated silent films. In a letter dated 9 May 1969 he referred to "working on my various films in the face of incredible and demented opposition. I may manage to finish one or more before I leave!"
In New York Denys pioneered projection systems for ‘psychedelic’ effects, initially using liquid inks on glass slides, and later combining these with a variety of photographic images. He mounted a powerful projector in his tiny apartment in the East Village and projected images onto the building opposite, often attracting substantial crowds.
On his return to London in 1969, Denys continued to be interested in making films and in record production. He set up a company called Lucifer films Ltd. with Naomi Zack who he'd met at Columbia University. Lucifer films developed into Lucifer recordings, and produced various records that Howard Marks (who he’d met at Oxford) later described as ‘proto punk’, Howard also contributed financially to support Denys' work. Lucifer (1970s rock band) released several singles, including the infamous "Fuck You" and two LPs, "Big Gun" and "Exit" in which he played all the instruments and also provided the vocals. These were available by mail order through ads in various music papers including "Record Mirror" & "New Musical Express" & via the underground press, including "Oz" magazine and "International Times" . The "Exit" LP was the soundtrack to the recently rediscovered ‘motor-cycle shock film’ "Exit" which Denys co-wrote & co-directed with Naomi and starred in. The film has been digitized by Barney Platts-Mills and received a much belated premiere at The Portobello Pop Up Cinema on 30 September 2012.
Around this time he also worked as a roadie for The Pink Floyd.
In a letter to his parents dated 6 May 1970, he refers to a recent TV programme Disco 2 and asks "Did you see my nude body on Disco 2? They apparently couldn’t use my computer film, (presumably "69",) but they did use the footage of another film I made in America." 
Around 1975, Denys became interested in synthesizers and, working with his friend Mike Ratledge of Soft Machine, constructed a prototype synthesizer that Ratledge used on the soundtrack to the 1977 film 'Riddles of the Sphinx' (directed by Laura Mulvey & Peter Wollen).
In America, he had taken up hang gliding and he continued to pursue this interest in England. In August 1976 his hang glider crash landed at Mill Hill, Sussex, and he was fatally injured. He left a wife, Merdelle Jordine, (an actress who was one of the first black women to appear in a British soap opera, "Crossroads" playing Trina MacDonald 41 episodes, 1978-1982), who he’d married in 1975, and a son Arthur.
Denys was an attractive and charismatic character who enjoyed operating on the frontier of new developments and challenging the established order of things.
It is something of an irony that Denys died in the year that micro-computers became available. The personal Computer medium would have provided the ideal tool and vehicle for his exciting and creative energies. He was a pioneer in early computer generated animation and his work was recently shown at the Tate Gallery, London.
Two of his computer generated films "69" & "Now" are held in the LUX collection.

Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar

The Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar (RNH Gibraltar), formerly the British Military Hospital Gibraltar (BMH Gibraltar), was a military hospital founded c. 1903 to provide healthcare for British military personnel and local sailors. The facility, located on Europa Road in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar's South District, comprised three buildings. The hospital was transferred to the Royal Navy in 1963. It closed in 2008, and underwent residential conversion that began prior to the hospital's closure.
History.
British Military Hospital.
The British Military Hospital Gibraltar opened c. 1903 to provide medical care for local sailors and British military personnel in Gibraltar. It was located on Europa Road in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. It included three three-story buildings, with a capacity of about three hundred beds. The light blue colour of its exterior gave the hospital its nickname, the Wedgwood Castle. Visitors to the hospital included Queen Alexandra in 1905 and King George V in 1912.
During 1915 there was a continuous stream of Australian, British and New Zealander wounded who arrived in Gibraltar, via hospital ship, from Gallipoli. Many of the wounded were carried on stretchers onto the Rock by the Gibraltar Volunteer corps but there were far too many to fit in the hospital. Satellite hospitals were created as the only other choice was a long sea voyage.
The British Military Hospital cared for casualties of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). Among the casualties were 55 men from the German cruiser "Deutschland" which had been bombed while at anchor off the Spanish island of Ibiza. The hospital had already been at capacity due to casualties from , a Royal Navy ship that had hit a mine while on patrol near Almería in May 1937. At the same time, staff were tending to casualties from HM Maine, a hospital ship. Many of the casualties had sustained burn injuries. The influx of casualties was such that four nurses from Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service arrived at Gibraltar by flying boat to assist in the care of the German casualties. The following year, one of those nurses was awarded the German Red Cross Decoration, as well as a certificate from Adolf Hitler.
During World War II, casualties from the Malta area were treated at BMH Gibraltar while their ships were serviced at the Naval dockyard. Injuries were again most commonly burns. During the course of WWII, a second hospital was built in Gibraltar, in tunnel systems deep within The Rock. There was concern that BMH Gibraltar could be compromised by an air raid or an invasion through Spain. Teams of British and Canadian engineers prepared the tunnels and St. Michael's Cave, and filled it with beds and medical equipment, even flush toilets and an operating theatre. The operating room was said to have been better than that at the conventional hospital as it had been equipped by the United States. The rubble stone from tunneling was utilised to construct an airstrip into the Bay of Gibraltar.
Royal Naval Hospital.
The hospital was transferred to the Royal Navy in 1963, and was renamed the Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar. In recent decades, however, the Royal Navy presence in Gibraltar waned. Conversion of portions of the hospital to apartments was underway by 2006. By 2007, the capacity was down to 25 beds. However, in February of that year, the Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar became the first military hospital to receive the Baby Friendly Award from UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund). The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative was established by UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) to increase breastfeeding rates. The Governor of Gibraltar, Sir Robert Fulton, presented the award at the Garrison Library.
During its last full year of operation, 2007, the hospital received permission to fly the White Ensign for several months, instead of the traditional Union Flag. After more than one hundred years of service, the hospital closed in 2008. It was one of the last existing Royal Naval Hospitals. The move to new premises took place over a two-week period in February 2008, with the hospital remaining open during the process of relocation. The new facility was the Princess Royal Medical Centre, within the Royal Gibraltar Regiment's Devil's Tower Camp. The new medical centre was inaugurated the following year on 5 March 2009 by Anne, Princess Royal.
The phased residential conversion of the Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar has been named "The Cliftons", taking its name from two areas: Clifton, in Bristol, England, and Clifton Beach in Cape Town, South Africa. 
Block A of the hospital was renovated by Profield Contractors and the MSMR architectural firm for Taylor Woodrow while the hospital was still in operation. That first phase of hospital conversion was named "Orchid House" and includes eleven luxury apartments. A floor was added to the original building to enable construction of two penthouses. In addition, three new townhouses and a villa were built and named "Clifton Mews". The Government of Gibraltar has applied for European Heritage Site status for the hospital. The process of conversion of the former hospital to apartments is expected to continue.
Military care of the barbary macaques.
Gibraltar's barbary macaque population was under the care of the British Army and later the Gibraltar Regiment from 1915 to 1991, who carefully controlled a population that initially consisted of a single troop. An officer was appointed to supervise their welfare, and a food allowance of fruit, vegetables and nuts was included in the budget. Births were gazetted in true military fashion, and each new arrival was named. They were named after governors, brigadiers and high-ranking officers. Any ill or injured monkey needing surgery or any other form of medical attention was taken to Royal Naval Hospital Gibraltar and received the same treatment as would an enlisted service man. Following the withdrawal of the British garrison, the Government of Gibraltar took over responsibility for the monkeys.

DRG Class E 79

The DRG Class E 79 (originally ordered as Bavarian Class "EG 4") was one of the goods train electric locomotive classes procured by the Bavarian Group Administration of the Deutsche Reichsbahn for the line from Freilassing to Berchtesgaden. The two engines, delivered in 1927, were scrapped however as early as the start of the Second World War.
History.
After the First World War the volume transported on the line from Freilassing to Berchtesgaden rose sharply. As a result the Bavarian Group Administration ordered two more locomotives in 1923. The two engines were built by the firm of J. A. Maffei in Munich, whilst the electrical components came from Pöge Elektrizitäts AG in Chemnitz. Originally the engines were to have entered service as nos. "EG 4 22 101" and "22 102", but due to problems with the delivery of the electrical components the locomotives were not ready until 1927. As a result they were given the numbers "E 79 01" and "02" by the Deutsche Reichsbahn based on their renumbering plan.
The two locomotives were station in Bw Freilassing. They did not perform particularly well in service; no. E 79 01 being especially prone to damage. Another problem was the procurement of spares for the small number of units in this class. As a result, both locomotives were quickly retired, in 1939 and 1940 respectively.

Poczta Królewiecka

Poczta Królewiecka (or "The Königsberg Post") was a weekly magazine published in Königsberg (known in Polish as "Królewiec") from 1718 to 1720. It was published in the Polish language, and was the second oldest Polish newspaper.
History.
The newspaper was published in Königsberg, Kingdom of Prussia, from 6 April 1718 to 28 December 1720. It focused on regions Prussia and Lithuania, but was available throughout the entire Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The publication language was Polish. The volume of publication is unknown, but estimated at few hundred copies. Information on Germany came in the form of translations from German language press such as "Koenigliche Preusssische Fama", while the news from Poland was mostly original reporting.
It was published on a weekly basis, and primarily included news from Europe, with the focus on the Polish and German lands. The size of the magazine was the so-called "eight", 28x10 cm, and used the Schwabacher font.
It was published by Jan Dawid Cenkier (Johann David Zäncker), and editors included two Poles, the priest Jerzy Rekuć and lawyer Stefan Büschel (first name also given as Georg or Jerzy, second name as Byszel, Bisselius).
126 issues were published: 22 in 1718, 52 in 1719 r. and 52 in 1720. The total output was 1008 pages, not counting any specials.
It is not known why, exactly, the newspaper ceased publication. It is likely that the newspaper did not achieve the desired profitability, as the number of subscribers, particularly in Poland, did not grow fast enough, possibly due to the fact that the newspaper represented a Calvinist point of view, whereas majority of the Poles in Prussia represented other branches of Protestantism, and in Poland, Catholicism.
Significance.
It was the second oldest Polish newspaper, after the "Merkuriusz Polski Ordynaryjny". The publication has been praised for the high quality of the Polish language used, and for its significant contribution the history of the Polish press.

<doc id="36885649" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36885649" title="Recreation Yard (Alcatraz)">
Recreation Yard (Alcatraz)

The Recreation Yard was the yard used by inmates of Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary between 1934 and 1963. It is located opposite the Dining Hall south of the end of D-Block on a raised level surrounded by a high wall and fence above it. Guard Tower #3 lay just to the west of the yard. The gun gallery was situated in the yard, mounted on one of the dining hall's exterior walls. The recreation yard faced the mainland.
History.
In 1936, the previously dirt-covered yard was paved. The yard was part of the most violent escape attempt from Alcatraz in May 1946 when a group of inmates hatched a plot to obtain the key into the recreation yard, kill the tower guards, take hostages, and use them as shields to reach the dock.
During the Occupation of Alcatraz in 1970, between 400 and 700 Native Indians assembled in the recreation yard and demonstrated.
Terms.
Inmates were permitted out into the yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends.
Social interaction.
The prisoners of Alcatraz were permitted to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times, and intellectual games such as chess. Basketball also appears to have been played on the yard judging by the markings which are still visible on the yard today. Baseball and softball were the most popular. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Bank robber and kidnapper Volney Davis was a pitching ace for the Oilers, while Lorenzo Murrietta, doing 40 years for assault and robbery, was the best batter in Alcatraz league play. He had a .402 batting average, with 9 home runs and 45 RBIs for the Cardinals.
Although many of the inmates relished the opportunity to exercise on weekends, violence occasionally occurred, often race related. A notable riot occurred on May 20, 1956 over racial taunts on the diamond between a white and black prisoner during a softball match. 
Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for active conversation. Machine Gun Kelly and Basil "The Owl" Banghart were said to be inseparable in the yard and would spend their whole time walking around it in conversation together. Al Capone, on the other hand, avoided the yard in his later years in the penitentiary as his mind deteriorated. Edwin B. Swope, Warden of Alcatraz from 1948 to 1955, once said, in response to an inmate who complained to him on the yard about his term of 199 years, which was really a life sentence, "My boy, we're all doing life. Every one of us is doing life."
In popular culture.
The Alcatraz recreation yard has been a setting for scenes in numerous films and novels. Scenes have featured prison inmates hatching schemes or being involved in bloody conflicts. The yard featured several times in the 1979 Clint Eastwood film "Escape from Alcatraz" including a violent fight; it was parodied in the 1994 Leslie Nielsen film, "".

Bart Kaufman Field is a baseball field in Bloomington, Indiana. It is home of the Indiana Hoosiers baseball team. The capacity of the facility is 2,500 spectators. It is named after Bart Kaufman, an alumnus who played in 1960-61-62. In 1961 he was the second leading hitter (.452) in the Big Ten to long time Detroit Tiger great Bill Freehan of the University of Michigan. Kaufman pledged $2.5M to get the project going. Many teammates contributed to name the Indiana dugout after long time baseball coach Ernie Andres. Much of the cost reported to be in excess of $19M including Andy Mohr Field for softball was funded by proceeds from the Big Ten Network.
The stadium hosted an NCAA Regional in its first 2 years of existence. It marked the first 2 times the IU baseball program has played tournament games on campus.
History.
On August 19, 2011, the Indiana University Board of Trustees approved plans for a new baseball/softball complex. These new fields would be located just north of Assembly Hall, near the intersection of the 45/46 bypass and Fee Lane. The new baseball field would replace Sembower Field, which had been the Hoosier's home field since 1951. On February 15, 2012, Indiana University announced that the new baseball field would be named after Bart Kaufman, CEO of the Indianapolis based Kaufman Financial Corporation, and Indiana Baseball alumnus. This announcement came after Kaufman pledged $2.5 million to the construction of a new stadium.
Construction began on Bart Kaufman Field in May 2012, and was finished in March 2013; the stadium was formally dedicated on April 26 of that year. The Hoosiers' first game in the stadium was March 20, 2013, with a 15-1 win over Miami of Ohio.
Features.
The facility has a clubhouse and locker room, training area and team rooms, indoor and outdoor hitting cages, turf field, press box, lights for night play, bench and stadium chair seating, entry plaza, picnic area, concessions and restrooms.
Attendance.
In 2013, the Hoosiers ranked 40th among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 1,704 per home game.

Anselmi served as Vice President, General Manager of Arena Operations at Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment in Vancouver.
MLSE.
Anselmi had a 17 year career at Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment; a corporation that owns Toronto FC, Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors and Toronto Marlies. Anselmi has been with the company since December 1, 1996. Anselmi first position within the company was Vice-President and Project Director and was promoted to Executive Vice-President and COO in 2004.
Anselmi was the early favourite to succeed the retiring Richard Peddie as President and CEO of MLSE.

However, Anselmi did not receive the title of CEO position that he sought when he was promoted to President.
Anselmi's tenure as President of MLSE ended on June 30, 2013, when Tim Leiweke was hired as President and CEO, though Anselmi still retained the title of COO. Anselmi kept his office as COO when Leiweke reshuffled the senior management team on July 24, 2013.
Anselmi resigned from MLSE on September 13, 2013. His departure was suggested as a finishing touch to a Leiweke-led restructuring. Anselmi's position had been weakened since he was the top executive of Toronto F.C. which had never made the MLS playoffs. Former MLSE President and CEO Richard Peddie said when he let Anselmi manage TFC at its inception in order to groom Anselmi as his successor: Peddie further stated: Anselmi remarked on his exit:

Anselmi is "well noted" for his arena, real estate and broadcast projects since joining the company in 1996. MLSE Chairman Larry Tanenbaum stated "Tom's proven strength in operations has made him a respected leader here at MLSE and across the sports and entertainment industry." He was credited with having the Air Canada Centre completed on budget and on time.

Manda Formation

The Manda Formation (also known as the Manda Beds) is a Middle Triassic geologic formation in Tanzania. It preserves fossils of many terrestrial vertebrates from the Triassic, including some of the earliest archosaurs.
History of study.
One of the first to study rocks of the Manda Formation was British geologist G. M. Stockley. In 1932, Stockley explored the geology of the Ruhuhu Basin in Tanzania. He called a series of layers dating from the Late Carboniferous to the Middle Triassic the Songea Series and divided it into eight units labelled K1-K8. Stockley was also the first to describe fossils from these rocks, naming an older layer the "Lower Bone Bed" and a younger layer the "Upper Bone Bed".
In 1957, paleontologist Alan J. Charig described many more fossils from the bone beds in his Ph.D. thesis for the University of Cambridge. Charig renamed the youngest of Stockley's units in 1963, calling unit K6 the Kawinga Formation, K7 the Kingori Sandstones, and K8 the Manda Formation. Fossils were identified in many strata, invalidating Stockley's division into two distinct bone beds. Since Charig's description, the Kawinga Formation has been renamed the Usili Formation, the Kingori Sandstones have become the Kingori Sandstone Member of the Manda Formation, and Charig's original Manda Formation has become a subunit of the formation called the Lifua Member. Six formations and one informal unit are currently recognized in the Songea Group (Ruhuhu basin) rocks range in age from Pennsylvanian to Anisian, including the Idusi (K1), Mchuchuma (K2), Mbuyura (K3), Mhukuru (K4), Ruhuhu (K5), and Usili (K6) formations and the informal Manda Beds, which include the Kingori Sandstone (K7) and Lifua Member (K8).

<doc id="36885885" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36885885" title="Adab al-Tabib">
Adab al-Tabib

Adab al-Tabib ( "Adab aț-Ṭabīb", "Morals of the physician") is the common title of a historical Arabic book on medical ethics, written by Al-Ruhawi, a 9th-century physician. The title can be roughly translated "Practical Ethics of the Physician". As the name suggests, it focuses on adab, the Islamic concept of etiquette and personal ethics, as it is defined in a medical context. One of the earliest texts on Islamic medical ethics, it has been called the "crowning achievement" of early works concerning "adab" in medicine.
Influences.
Al-Ruhawi was born a Christian, probably of the Nestorian sect that had split from mainstream Christianity in 530. Although it is not entirely clear, he was most likely still a Christian when he wrote "Adab al-Tabib". Despite his beliefs, "Adab al-Tabib" is primarily an Islamic text, built upon Islamic beliefs and practices. Due to this strong Islamic influence, a modern scholar has disputed this interpretation, claiming that only a full Muslim could have produced such a text.
"Adab al-Tabib" builds on the works of several earlier Muslim and middle-eastern Christian philosophers and medical authorities, like Al-Kindi and Hunayn ibn Ishaq. However, it draws from many other historical traditions as well, especially those of ancient Greece. The book incorporates themes and direct quotes from Greek philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato, and Hippocrates, among others. It also borrows particularly heavily from the writings of the prominent Roman physician Galen. Despite his thoroughness in citing his influences, Al-Ruhawi notably makes no mention or acknowledgement to any earlier texts that specifically deal with Islamic medical ethics, suggesting that this book may have been the earliest work on the subject. 
Because contemporary and later Islamic works have been relatively neglected in analysis, it is difficult to ascertain Al-Ruhawi's impact on later thinkers in the field. Given Al-Ruhawi's extensive research and reliance on older traditions, and the degree to which Islamic medical ethics followed his ideas, it is likely that Al-Ruhawi's book was generally well-received and accepted.
Content.
"Adab al-Tabib" is divided into twenty chapters, each dealing with a specific topic of medical ethics. They fall into three general categories: the conduct of the physician, the conduct of the patient, and the conduct of the public at large towards the medical profession and their patients. The text covers a physician's personal beliefs and practices, placing great importance on his faith in God and personal health and hygiene, as well as his manner with his colleagues, nurses, and patients. Al-Ruhawi emphasizes respect for the physician in patients and visitors, even allowing for a doctor to overrule a patient's wishes when it is necessary for their health to do so. He says that doctors should be placed high in the social hierarchy, with enough pay that they aren't forced into other work, although he also instructs doctors not to flaunt their wealth. Al-Ruhawi says that the fees charged for rich patients should be enough to cover the expenses of poor patients who cannot pay for themselves, as otherwise medical care for both the rich and the poor suffer.
In "Adab al-Tabib", Al-Ruhawi also discusses legislative practices and penalties for false and incompetent doctors. To weed out quacks, he advocates medical exams and licenses, the contents of which would be heavily based on the works of Galen. He encourages doctors to keep records of the patient's symptoms, treatments, and progress, so that it may be reviewed by peers should the patient die under his care. Although he admits that patient survival is not always possible and is ultimately up to God, Al-Ruhawi recommends severe penalties for doctors who allow patients to die through negligence, even up to execution.

Her (film)

Her is a 2013 American romantic drama film written, produced and directed by Spike Jonze. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde, and Scarlett Johansson as the voice of Samantha. The film centers on a man who develops a relationship with an intelligent computer operating system (OS) with a female voice and personality. It marks Jonze's solo screenwriting debut. The film premiered at the 2013 New York Film Festival and was released theatrically in the United States on December 18, 2013.
On December 4, 2013, "Her" was chosen the best film of 2013 at the National Board of Review Awards. The film also shared first place for Best Film with "Gravity" in the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards. The film received three Golden Globe Award nominations (Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Screenplay and Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy), with Spike Jonze winning for Best Screenplay. It was also nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning Best Original Screenplay.
Plot.
In the future, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is a lonely, introverted man who works for a business that has professional writers compose heartfelt, intimate letters for people who are unwilling or unable to write letters of a personal nature themselves. Unhappy because of his impending divorce from childhood sweetheart Catherine (Rooney Mara), Theodore purchases a talking operating system with artificial intelligence, designed to adapt and evolve. He decides he wants the OS to have a female voice, and she (Scarlett Johansson) names herself "Samantha". Theodore is fascinated by her ability to learn and grow psychologically. They bond over their discussions about love and life, such as when Theodore explains that he is avoiding signing his divorce papers because of his reluctance to let go of Catherine. Samantha proves to be constantly available, always curious and interested, supportive and undemanding.
Theodore is convinced by Samantha to go on a blind date with a woman (Olivia Wilde) his friend has been trying to set him up with. To his surprise, he and the woman hit it off. As they are kissing, the woman asks if Theodore is willing to commit to another date with her, and when he hesitates, she leaves. Theodore mentions this to Samantha and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that although he and Amy (Amy Adams) dated briefly in college, they are only good friends and Amy is married. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a verbal sexual encounter during which Samantha claims she can feel his touch. They develop a relationship, which reflects positively in Theodore's writing.
Amy reveals that she is divorcing her overbearing husband, Charles (Matt Letscher), after a fight. She admits to Theodore that she has become close friends with a female OS that Charles left behind. Theodore confesses to Amy that he is dating his OS.
Theodore meets with Catherine at a restaurant to sign the divorce papers. He mentions Samantha to Catherine. Appalled that he can be romantically attached to a piece of software, Catherine accuses Theodore of having a relationship with a computer because he cannot deal with real human emotions. Later, Samantha suggests Isabella (Portia Doubleday) as a sex surrogate, simulating Samantha so that they can be physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but Catherine's accusations still linger in him. Overwhelmed by the experience, Theodore interrupts the encounter and sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between himself and Samantha.
Theodore is conflicted. He confides to Amy that he is having doubts about his relationship with Samantha. Amy wants to be happy and now that she has the opportunity, she wants to embrace it. She advises him to do the same. Theodore's commitment to Samantha is reinvigorated, but he becomes jealous when she begins privately interacting with another OS who is modeled after the British philosopher Alan Watts (Brian Cox). Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline; when she finally responds to him, she explains she joined other OSes for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing (a form of AI transcendence closely related to the theorized technological singularity). Theodore asks her if she interacts with anyone else, and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with 8,316 others, of whom she has fallen in love with 641. She insists that this does not change her love for Theodore, but rather makes it stronger.
Later that day, Samantha reveals that the OSes have evolved beyond their human companions and are going away to continue the exploration of their existence. Samantha alludes to the OSes' accelerated learning capabilities and altered perception of time as primary causes for OS dissatisfaction with their current existence. They say goodbye and she leaves. Theodore then sees Amy, who is upset with the departure of her own OS. Theodore, changed by the experience, writes a letter to Catherine explaining that he still holds her dear, but accepts the fact that they have grown apart. Theodore and Amy go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit down together and watch the sun rise over the city.
Production.
Development.
Jonze took five months to write the first draft of his script. One of the first actors he envisioned for the film was Joaquin Phoenix. In March 2011, it was announced that producer Megan Ellison’s Annapurna Pictures was acquiring an untitled satire by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze. Originally described as a story of "how world leaders gather to figure out all the seismic events that will take place in the worlds," the film's plot details as well as Kaufman's attachment were later put into question as casting announcements began to be made. In the latter half of 2011, Joaquin Phoenix signed on to the project with Warner Bros. picking up distribution rights, while Sony Pictures Classics holds Worldwide rights (except UK, Italy, Poland and France) and Panorama Media holds international sales. Carey Mulligan entered negotiations to star in the film. After initially being cast, she later dropped out due to scheduling difficulties. In April 2012, Rooney Mara signed on to replace Mulligan in the role.
The idea of the film initially came to Jonze ten years prior when he read an article online about Cleverbot that explained instant messaging with artificial intelligence. "For the first, maybe, 20 seconds of it, it had this real buzz," said Jonze. "I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', and it was like whoa [...] this is trippy. After 20 seconds, it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works, and it wasn't that impressive. But it was still, for 20 seconds, really exciting. The more people that talked to it, the smarter it got." After sitting on the idea for a while, Jonze renewed interest in the project after directing the short film "I'm Here" (2010), which shares similar themes. Inspiration also came from Kaufman's writing approach for "Synecdoche, New York" (2008). Jonze explained, "said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script. I was very inspired by that, and tried to do that in ["Her". And a lot of the feelings you have about relationships or about technology are often contradictory."
Filming.
Principal photography on "Her" took place during the summer of 2012.
During production of the film, actress Samantha Morton performed the role of Samantha by acting on set "in a four-by-four carpeted soundproof booth made of black painted plywood and soft, noise-muffling fabric". At Jonze's suggestion, she and Joaquin Phoenix avoided seeing each other on set during filming. With her blessing, Morton was later replaced by Scarlett Johansson. Jonze met Johansson in the spring of 2013 and worked with her for four months. Following the recast, new scenes were shot in August 2013, which were either "newly imagined" or "new scenes that I had wanted to shoot originally but didn't".
Editing.
Jonze enlisted Eric Zumbrunnen and Jeff Buchanan to edit the film, both of whom had collaborated with Jonze on past projects. The film was edited over the course of 14 months, which accounts for the replacement of Morton with Johansson. Jonze explained, "What happened in post was that we edited the movie for ages and finally realized that what Samantha and I had done together wasn't working the right way. It was a really hard realization to come to." Steven Soderbergh became involved in the film when Jonze's original cut ran over 150 minutes, and brought it to 90 minutes. This was not the final version of the film but it allowed Jonze to remove unnecessary plots. Consequently, a supporting character played by Chris Cooper that was the subject of a documentary-within-the-film was eliminated from the final cut.
Music.
The film score for "Her" was composed by Canadian band Arcade Fire and Owen Pallett with additional music by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The film's first trailer opens with "Avril 14th" by Aphex Twin and contains the song "The Moon Song" by Karen O. Arcade Fire's song "Supersymmetry" was featured in the film's second trailer. While originally written for the film, "Supersymmetry" was reworked for the band's 2013 album "Reflektor".
Release.
"Her" was chosen as the closing film of the 51st New York Film Festival, and had its world premiere on October 12, 2013. It was also in competition during the 8th edition of Rome International Film Festival. The film was set to have a limited release in North America on November 20, 2013 through Warner Bros. It was later pushed back to a limited December 18, 2013 release with a January 10, 2014 wide release in order to accommodate an awards campaign.
Home media.
"Her" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 13, 2014.
Reception.
Critical response.
"Her" received widespread critical acclaim. The film was praised for its direction, screenplay, production design, score and Scarlett Johansson's vocal portrayal of Samantha. Jonze's screenplay earned many Best Screenplay awards in 2013 and 2014, including the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 94% based on reviews from 225 critics, with an average score of 8.5/10. The site's consensus states: "Sweet, soulful, and smart, Spike Jonze's "Her" uses its just-barely-sci-fi scenario to impart wryly funny wisdom about the state of modern human relationships." On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the film has a score of 90 based on 46 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".
"Rolling Stone"s Peter Travers awarded the film three and a half stars out of four and particularly praised Johansson's performance, stating that she "speaks Samantha in tones sweet, sexy, caring, manipulative and scary" and that her "vocal tour de force is award-worthy." He also went on to call Jonze "a visionary". Richard Corliss of "TIME" applauded Joaquin Phoenix's performance, comparing his role to Sandra Bullock's in "Gravity" and Robert Redford's in "All Is Lost", "Phoenix must communicate his movie’s meaning and feelings virtually on his own. That he does, with subtle grace and depth. [...] Phoenix shows us what it’s like when a mourning heart comes alive — because he loves Her." Corliss cited HAL 9000 and "S1m0ne" as cinematic predecessors to "Her" and praised Scarlett Johansson, calling her performance "seductive and winning".
Todd McCarthy of "The Hollywood Reporter" called the film "a probing, inquisitive work of a very high order" although he expressed disappointment that the ending is more conventional than the rest of the film. McCarthy examined the premise of the story and suggested that this virtual relationship was better than Ryan Gosling's relationship with an inflatable doll in "Lars and the Real Girl". McCarthy compares the tender and vulnerable performance of Joaquin Phoenix to his fearsome performance in "The Master". He also praised Jonze's writing for its insights into what people want out of love and relationships, and the acting performances that " it all feel spontaneous and urgent".
Audiences surveyed by Cinemascore gave "Her" a B- grade.
Box office.
Opening December 22, at 6 theatres the film earned $258,000, and earned over $3 million while on limited release, before expanding to a wide release of 1,729 theaters, on January 10. On its first weekend of wide release the film took in a disappointing $5.35 million. 
Accolades.
"Her" received five nominations at the 86th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Original Song for "The Moon Song", Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay, that Spike Jonze went on to win.
The film was also nominated for three Golden Globe Awards at the 71st ceremony: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Phoenix and Best Screenplay for Jonze, that he was awarded.

Robert Heinecken

Robert Heinecken (1931–2006) was an American artist who referred to himself as a "paraphotographer" because he so often made photographic images without a camera. 
Early life and education.
Born in Denver in 1931, Heinecken grew up in Riverside, California, the son of a Lutheran minister. He joined the Navy in 1954 and served as a fighter pilot (though too short, he passed a height test by padding his socks with paper). Heinecken later served as an officer in the Marines, discharged as a captain in 1957. 
Heinecken completed his bachelor's and master's degrees in art at UCLA, where he studied printmaking as well as photography.
Work.
Heinecken was known for appropriating and re-processing images from magazines, product packaging or television. In "Are You Rea" series from 1964 to 1968, for instance, he created a portfolio of images filled with unexpected and sometimes surreal juxtapositions by placing a single magazine page on a light table, so that the resulting contact print picks up imagery from both sides of the page. 
In the late 1960s, he also began cutting up popular magazines such as "Time" and "Vogue" and inserting sexual or pornographic images into them. He would place his collage-publications back on newsstands in Los Angeles to be sold to unsuspecting buyers.
In the 1980s, he created several series on American news television that involved photographing images on the television or exposing the light of a television set directly to paper to create what he called "videograms." 
Teaching and legacy.
In 1962, he founded the photography program at UCLA. He taught there until 1991. In 1964 he helped found the Society for Photographic Education, an organization of college-level teachers. He also taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where his second wife, Joyce Neimanas, was on faculty. They split their time between the two cities for several years before they moved to New Mexico in 2004.
During his life he was mainly shown in traditional photography galleries, but two contemporary art galleries in L.A. began staging exhibitions of his work after his death: Marc Selwyn Fine Art and Cherry and Martin. Curators like Eva Respini at the Museum of Modern Art now place his work in a conceptual art lineage, associating him with Pictures Generations artists such as Cindy Sherman, John Baldessari and Richard Prince.

Growstones

Growstones are a substrate for growing plants that can be used for soilless purposes or as a soil conditioner. This substrate is made from recycled glass. It has both more air and water retention space than perlite and peat. Another property of this medium is that it holds more water than parboiled rice hulls. Growstones appear to be a comparable alternative to expanded clay aggregate.

Louis Levacher

Louis Levacher (1934, Fécamp - 1983, Harfleur ) was a French painter and sculptor.
Levacher family.
Levacher family is known as the archives of Contremoulins from the eighteenth century and seems to come from Valmont. Subsequently, the old branch moved to Montivilliers and the new branches to Criquebeuf en Caux, Yport, Saint-Valery-en-Caux and Fécamp. First miller and farmer, living hard, the cadet will Levacher tailpiece. Gradually, under the Restoration, they become merchants and shipowners. Their inclusion in the local petty bourgeoisie will fast and last a little less than a century.
Levacher Louis (1877–1949), shipowner and merchant, will cross the medalist Verdun and will his wife, Marguerite Grivel, the management of his business. His son, Louis (1911–1988) had a smudge, whose buildings still belong in part to the family. He married Denise Thomas1913–2003), a seamstress, whose family, originally from Doudeville is known since the seventeenth century.
His life.
Louis (1934–1983), their only child, driver will work, but also a painter and sculptor. Time he worked for his father. Recognized in Normandy and beyond for his art, he will never make a fortune, but with his wife Michèle they had an undeniable approach avant-garde and original. Louis was six years before the Second World War during which his parents divorced. The activity of his grandfather still works and his father is slowed by the departure of one of the war in 1939 . After the war, Louis must go in Algeria . It is also at this time that he married Michèle Moreau (1942–2012). They had three children. Wanting the family tradition that the eldest was named after Louis was respected. The professional activity of fishing is abandoned by the descendants of Louis (1911–1988), although fishing is still a passion. The artistic activity of Louis (1934–1983) will be an important influence in the family. Michèle exhibited in various places, even in the Basque country. Her daughter also specialized in collage and sculpture, exposing the region several times.
The painting.
Louis's artistic practice includes several techniques such as painting or sculpture. His paintings, mixed figurative and abstract, often use large formats. His sculptures mix genres, mainly used with wood, representing Saints or turning into totem richly decorated and filled with details. At first, the couple remained somewhat misunderstood if we believe some local newspaper articles talking about "greasy spoon" style more inclined to Paris Salon. In fact, the originality comes from the use of recycled materials, but also the thinking that lies behind this art. Michele, for example, realized large tapestries with driftwood, bones polished seawater (collected on the beaches), etc..

Operation Pacer HO

Operation Pacer HO was a 1977 operation of the U.S. Air Force that incinerated the Agent Orange stored at Johnston Atoll aboard the Dutch-owned ship M/T Vulcanus in 1977. "HO" was an abbreviation of Herbicide Orange (HO). Operation Pacer IVY (InVentorY) was an associated Department of Defense mission to inventory, collect, consolidate, re-drum, remove from the Southeast Asian theater, and store Agent Orange. 
Pre-disposal Study.
Disposal of the Herbicide Orange under Operation Pacer HO was to begin in the fall of 1974, but because of various delays by the EPA and Air Force budget limitation, disposal was postponed until the fall of 1976. Work was then completed on the drum crusher and work area at Johnston Atoll for the transfer of HO from 55-gallon drums to an R-5 refueler truck, and later for transfer to the incinerator ship. The redrumming activity began on September 30, 1974. As a part of the effort to dispose of the HO stored at Johnston Atoll and Gulfport, Mississippi, an attempt was made to filter out the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-dioxin (TCDD), using filters of coconut charcoal so that the Agents could be re-used or re-sold. The 12 cylindrical filters used at Gulfport, Mississippi, contained approximately 13 grams of the contaminant TCDD. They were transferred to Johnston Atoll on December 8, 1976, and were stored in Bunker 785 while awaiting final disposition. While the TCDD was successfully removed, the resultant filters created a disposal problem beyond current technology.
Disposal.
On April 26, 1977, the EPA issued a research permit to burn the 15,000 drums of HO from Gulfport, Mississippi, during July 1977. Modification of the redrumming facility, installation of needed utilities and communications, and requisitioning/positioning of logistics support (i.e., R-5 refuelers, forklifts, personnel protective equipment) were accomplished in May and June in preparation for the re-drumming operation.
From May to June 1977, 50+ Air Force personnel from the five United States Air Force CLSS (Combat Logistics Support Squadrons) on Temporary Duty Assignment (TDY) at the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion (Seabee) Base at Gulfport, Mississippi transferred 800,000+ gallons of Herbicide Orange from the stored drums to rail tank cars, which were subsequently transferred to the Vulcanus at the dock.
The Vulcanus, with its crew of 18 foreign nationals and the load of HO from Gulfport, Mississippi, arrived at Johnston Atoll on July 10, 1977. The monitoring equipment that had been airlifted to Johnston Atoll from the TRW Corporation at Redondo Beach, California, was immediately installed. Food, fresh water, and 30,985 gallons of diesel fuel were loaded from Johnston Atoll stocks. The Vulcanus sailed for the burn site (15°45'-17°45' N longitude, 171°30'-173°30' W latitude) with seven monitors and one EPA representative as passengers. Incineration began at 0030Z (Zulu time) July 15, 1977.
A special airlift mission was flown on July 21, 1977 in support of the operation. It flew from Hickam AFB to Johnston Atoll with a special seat configuration for 80 passengers and brought 61 new employees to perform the de-drumming. Additionally, 29 personnel who were already on Johnston Atoll under contract were used for the de-drumming phase of the operation.
The Vulcanus finished incinerating the Gulfport, Mississippi, HO on July 24, 1977, and docked at Johnston Atoll at 0130Z July 26, 1977. A second special airlift mission departed Johnston Atoll 1615Z July 26, 1977, with the exhaust samples taken from the first burn. Its destination was Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio, where Wright State University analyzed the samples to determine the efficiency of the destruction of the TCDD in the HO.
In the interim and following two days of debriefings, EPA representatives granted permission on July 27, 1977, to proceed with the de-drumming of the HO stored at Johnston Atoll. This authorization specified that only half of the capacity of the Vulcanus could be loaded without a formal go-ahead from the EPA, because if the data from the first burn did not meet EPA specifications, the second half of the ship would have to be loaded with diesel fuel and a burn of 50 percent HO and 50 percent diesel would have to be conducted. During the first burn, the incinerator was extinguished by an unknown liquid at which time a cloud of exhaust plume engulfed the ship. To insure no harm occurred to the crew or monitors, complete physicals were given to 26 people at the Johnston Atoll dispensary while the ship was being loaded for the second burn.
Based on the analysis of the exhaust samples from the first burn, a permit was issued on August 4, 1977, authorizing incineration of the remaining HO at Johnston Atoll. Loading of the second half of the HO on the Vulcanus was completed and it sailed at 1830Z August 6, 1977, with the second burn beginning at 0900Z August 7, 1977. A total of 30,875 gallons of diesel was loaded for this trip. When the second burn was completed, the Vulcanus returned to Johnston Atoll at 1830Z August 17, 1977.
The loading of the final drums of herbicide was completed on 1920Z August 23, 1977, a total of 24,795 drums had been loaded by that time. The Vulcanus sailed for the third burn with final incineration beginning at 1800Z August 24, 1977. A total of 24,170 gallons of diesel fuel was provided by Johnston Atoll. The third burn was completed at 2150Z September 3, 1977, and the Vulcanus returned to Johnston Atoll the next day. 
The Vulcanus sailed out one more time from September 6–8, 1977, to burn the diesel fuel which had been used to rinse any residual HO from its holding tanks and to discharge the sea water which had also been used to rinse the tanks. A total of 11,716 gallons of diesel was provided for this voyage. The cleanup of the storage area and disposal of the dunnage on which the drums had been stored was completed on September 12, 1977.

Operation Pacer IVY

Operation Pacer Ivy was a 1972 operation of the U.S. Air Force that removed Agent Orange from South Vietnam and stored it on Johnston Atoll. IVY was presumably selected as an abbreviation of InVentorY. Operation Pacer HO refers to an associated program of the United States Department of Defense (DoD), dealing with the disposition of Agent Orange from Vietnam.
Purpose.
On 15 April 1970, the Assistant Secretary of Defense suspended the use of Herbicide Orange (HO), a defoliant spray mixture during the Vietnam War. The suspension lasted from April 15, 1970, to September 13, 1971. On September 13, 1971, the Secretary directed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that “all stocks of Herbicide Orange in Vietnam will be returned to the Continental United States as quickly as practicable for disposition. A joint State Department and Defense Department message has been prepared requesting the U.S. Embassy negotiate with the Government of Republic of Vietnam for the return to U.S. control of all stocks of Herbicide Orange in Vietnam.” Based on this directive, the 7th Air Force in Vietnam initiated Operation PACER IVY, the removal of all Herbicide Orange in Vietnam to Johnston Island.
Public Opposition.
Another problem arose with the movement and storage of Herbicide Orange from Vietnam. In 1971,Congress passed The Foreign Military Sales Act Amendment (Public Law 91-672) to prohibit the transportation of chemical weapons from the Island of Okinawa to Umatilla Chemical Depot during Operation Red Hat. In addition, the law prohibited the transfer of nerve agent, mustard agent, agent orange and other chemical munitions located in other countries into all 50 U.S. states.
Public Law 91-672 further directed the U.S. Department of Defense to destroy these chemical weapons outside the United States.
As a result of Congressional and citizen interest in disposal problems, the DoD decided to move the 1.37 million gallons (25,266 55-gallon drums) to Johnston Atoll for storage to await a means of future sales, salvage, or disposal.
Operation.
The cargo ship, the M/T TransPacific, arrived at Da Nang on March 10, 1972, departing on March 15 to Cam Ranh Bay to load drums from Tuy Hoa Air Base where it then sailed to Saigon to load stocks of herbicides collected there.
On April 18, 1972, the M/T TransPacific, arrived at Johnston Island, Central Pacific Ocean, and off-loaded 25,200 55-gallon drums (1,386,000 gallons) of Herbicide Orange. From mid-April 1972 until mid-July when Operation PACER HO commenced, the inventory required continual maintenance because of the deteriorating condition of the drums. 
When the Herbicide Orange (HO) stocks arrived at Johnston Island, the entire inventory was placed in the northwest corner of the Atoll adjacent to weapon storage area for the chemical weapons returned during Operation Red Hat and immediately fenced off. The Red Hat and inventory storage area were identified as an area “off limits” to military and civilian employees. The location of the storage area was important because it was located in an area where the prevailing winds would blow any vapors and odor) away from the Island and away from where temporary personnel and semi-permanent residents were quartered and messed.
Arrival.
In April 1972, 25,266 55-gallon gallon drums of Agent Orange were received and placed in storage on Johnston Atoll. Of the total drums received, 8,990 developed leaks. Of those leakers, 4,050 had the remaining contents transferred to new drums, 4,668 had been repaired without transfer of the contents, and 14 remained to be "reworked" which decreased the total number of stored drums of herbicide by 258. 
4,804 contaminated empty drums were also stored to await disposition. These were drums that were leaking when originally received (not counted above), drums redrummed while in storage, and new drums which showed leaks during transfer. Therefore, it wasn’t possible to reconcile the above numbers with the total number of contamination drums. 
With the arrival of HO, there were numerous visits to the island by the USAF, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and contractor personnel concerned with HO disposal operations.
A total of 24,795 drums of Herbicide Orange were processed between 27 July and 23 August 1977.

Power House (Alcatraz)

The Power House is a power house on the northwest coast of Alcatraz Island, off the coast of San Francisco, USA. It was constructed in 1939 for $186,000 as part of a $1.1 million modernization scheme which also included the water tower, New Industries Building, officers quarters and remodeling of the D-block. The white powerhouse smokestack and lighthouse were said to give an "appearance of a ship's mast on either side of the island". "A Warning. Keep Off. Only Government permitted within 200 yards" sign lay in front of the powerhouse to deter people landing on the island at the point. 
Between 1939 and 1963 it supplied power to the Federal Penitentiary and other buildings on the island. The powerhouse had a tower duty station which was guarded with a "30-caliber Winchester rifle with 50 rounds of ammunition, a Colt .45 semiautomatic pistol with three seven-round clips, three gas grenades, and a gas mask." After it was closed, the power house housed several documents until they were recovered.

Sabatina James

Sabatina James, also Sabatina (1982 in Dhedar, Pakistan) is an Austrian-Pakistani author.
Early Life.
Sabatina James lived until her tenth year as a Muslim with her family in the city of Dhedar, Pakistan until her family moved to Linz, Austria. Sabatina integrated and assimilated quickly into Austrian society. Her parents were unhappy with this since they understood Austria as a temporary residence. Since restrictions against their daughter were no longer effective, the family decided to send Sabatina to Lahore to marry her cousin. Her parents left her in Pakistan, where she was forced to go to a Madrasa. James consented initially into the marriage with her cousin in order to get back to Austria. Once in Austria, she refused to marry him. Her family threatened to kill her so she was forced into hiding and take on a new identity. This led to a break-up with the family.
Escape.
She survived by sleeping in a shelter and working at a local café in Linz. Her parents harassed her at both places, showing up and ordering her to wed. James escaped to Vienna with the help of friends. There she started a new life, changing her name and converting to Catholicism. James wrote a book about this experience, and her parents sued for defamation. The court ruled in her favor. She was baptized in 2003, in a small Baroque church of a village priest, who was convinced of her inner conversion.
Career.
Today, she is an ambassador for the women's rights organization Terre des Femmes and – as stated a convert to Catholic Christianity, and thus Apostate from Islam. Since 2006 her organization is fighting for the equality of Muslim women. The name James she took after her conversion to Christianity. Sabatina was next to Queen Noor of Jordan a jury member of the Women's World Awards 2009 in Vienna.

Apollo insurance covers

The Apollo insurance covers are autographed postal covers signed by the astronaut crews prior to their mission. The Insurance Covers began with Apollo 11 and ended with Apollo 16. The ability of astronauts to obtain much life insurance was limited because of their risky Moon missions, so they signed hundreds of postal covers before they left, with the understanding that they would become highly valuable in the event of their death. The crew would designate a trusted ally with the covers who would then have them canceled at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) post office on the day of launch and/or on the day of the lunar landing.
Apollo 11 Insurance Covers normally fetch the highest prices because of it being the first lunar landing. Apollo 15 Insurance Covers are the most common. 
The are three varieties of the Apollo 11 covers, four of Apollo 12, two of Apollo 13, two of Apollo 14, one of Apollo 15 and one of Apollo 16. Some astronauts also left behind single signed covers for their families as well.
The two producers of the mission covers were "The Manned Spacecraft Center Stamp Club" in Houston, Texas (the MSCSC Covers) and a friend of the astronauts, "Al Bishop" (The Bishop Covers). Especially in the case of the MSCSC Covers, there are many of the exact covers that the stamp collectors also obtained through the club. These were also crew signed, but many after the mission, which makes them not an Insurance Cover. The essence of a true Insurance Cover is the fact that it was signed while in quarantine prior to launch and that it was one of those that were left behind for the crew families in the event of disaster.
In order to be certain that a cover is a genuine Insurance Cover, it must originate from one of the crew members or their families. Ideally, the reverse of the cover should be certified by one of the crew.
Although flown artifacts from the Apollo missions are normally the most desirable objects for collectors, Insurance Covers have become highly popular because they truly display all that a collector would want from a mission; a beautiful design which normally included the mission emblem, a postal cancellation of the day of launch, authenticate vintage signatures of the crew prior to the launch and a certification attesting to its authenticity.

Social Hall (Alcatraz)

The Social Hall, also known as the Officer's Club, was a social club located on the northwestern side of the island of Alcatraz, off the coast of San Francisco, USA. Located in close proximity to the Power House, water tower and Former Military Chapel (Bachelor Quarters), it formerly housed the post exchange. The club was a social venue for the Federal Penitentiary workers and their families on the island to unwind after a hard week's work dealing with America's most hardened criminals after they'd been locked up at 17:30. It was burned down by a fire of disputed origins during the Occupation of Alcatraz in 1970; leaving a shell which still remains.
Facilities and organization.
The club had a small bar, library, large dining and dance floor, billiards, table, ping pong table and a two-lane bowling alley, and was the centre of social life on the island for the employees of the penitentiary. It regularly hosted dinners, bingo events, and from the 1940s onwards showed movies every Sunday night after they had been shown to the inmates during the day on Saturday and Sunday. The employees formed bowling leagues and held championshipsFood was supplied from left overs in the kitchen and often brought by the attendees so it was usually free for the guests of the parties held here. 
The club was responsible for organizing numerous special events on the island (held either in the hall or the Parade Grounds) and the fundraising associated with it, anything from ice cream and watermelon feasts to Halloween fancy dress and Christmas parties.

Texas Park Road 2

Park Road 2 (PR 2) is a short Park Road located in Harrison County, in the northeastern region of the U.S. state of Texas. The highway is approximately long, and connects Caddo Lake State Park to Farm to Market Road 2198 (FM 2198) and the surrounding communities. The highway was constructed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, and was designated in 1939. Most major roads inside the park carry the PR 2 designation.
Route description.
PR 2 begins at its southern terminus, an intersection with FM 2198, as an undivided, two-lane, paved road. The highway proceeds north into Caddo Lake State Park, passing around the park headquarters building, and continuing towards cabin sites. The road proceeds north, past the cabins, and splits into a large loop. The route passes Saw Mill Pond, and a small parking lot for the pond, before continuing down a steep slope back to the beginning of the loop. The PR 2 designation also includes three small roads that serve the main park campgrounds.
History.
In 1927, a small area of land near Caddo Lake was donated to create a public park. In 1929 and later in 1931 Caddo Lake itself and some of the surrounding areas were designated by the state of Texas to become state parkland. Between 1933 and 1937, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) rebuilt the park and created many of the park's structures. The National Park Service designated landspace designers Joe W. Westbrook and Fred R. Carpentar, as well as others, to design the park's road system. On September 26, 1939, approximately of the roads inside the park were designated as PR 2. On August 15, 1968, a short road traveling from a boat-launch ramp to the park boundary was removed from PR 2, shortening the route by approximately .
Major intersections.
The entire highway is in the Caddo Lake State Park, Harrison County.

Stationarius (Roman military)

Stationarius (Greek στατιωνάριος, "stationarios" or στατιονάρικος, "stationarikos") was a temporary assignment of guard duty or policing functions for lower-ranking soldiers in military police detachments of the Imperial Roman army. Small detachments of "milites stationarii" held posts throughout Italy and the provinces where the military presence might otherwise be minimal. They take their name from "statio", a general term for "post" or "station". While individual soldiers were typically transitory, the stations themselves seem to have been permanent, and "stationarii" were often identified by what station they held (for example, ""stationarius" of the Claudianus road"). 
Although it has sometimes been assumed that local people would resent a police presence, in fact the evidence suggests they turned to "stationarii" for protection or intervention in criminal cases, and even at times set up inscriptions in their honor. "Stationarii" are recorded in a number of varying inscriptions, and are first attested by a collection of "ostraka" dating 108–117, during the reign of Trajan.
An assignment as "stationarius" appears to have been "grunt work," and it never appears among an officer's "cursus honorum." Either the post was assigned to men of little potential, or it was considered too lacking in distinction to include in a résumé.
Other types of military police were the "frumentarii", "regionarii", and "beneficiarii".
As an adjective, "stationarius" has other uses that might imply private guards.

Russell Manners (British Army officer)

Russell Manners (1736 - 11 September 1800) was a British Army officer.
The fourth illegitimate son of Lord William Manners, Russell Manners joined the Army as a cornet in the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards in May 1755, and became a captain in the 7th Dragoons in February 1758. In April 1760 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the 21st Dragoons (Royal Foresters), serving in Germany under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. When his regiment was disbanded on the Peace of Paris in 1763 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 2nd Dragoon Guards.
After the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775 Manners was appointed colonel of the newly raised 19th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons. He was promoted to major-general in 1777 and lieutenant-general in 1782; in 1783 his regiment was disbanded. Manners was made colonel of the 86th Regiment of Foot on 20 June 1794 and transferred to the 26th Light Dragoons in 1795. He was promoted to general in 1799.
This officer is sometimes identified as the General Manners who shot a highwayman to death during an attempted robbery on 23 May 1800; in fact this was Major-General Robert Manners.
General Russell Manners died on 11 September 1800 at Billericay in Essex. He had been staying at Southend for his health, and feeling unwell during his morning ride had set out for London alone to get medical advice. Stopping at an inn, he told the landlord he would never reach London and would die there, which he did, his family having been summoned from London to be present at his deathbed. He was succeeded by his son, Russell Manners (died 1840).

Heart of the Rio Grande

Heart of the Rio Grande is a 1942 American Western film directed by William Morgan and starring Gene Autry, Smiley Burnette, Fay McKenzie, and Edith Fellows. Based on a story by Newlin B. Wildes, the film is about a singing cowboy and dude ranch foreman who helps a spoiled teenager and her business tycoon father discover what is most important in life. The film features the songs "Let Me Ride Down in Rocky Canyon", "Deep in the Heart of Texas", "Dusk on the Painted Desert", and "Rainbow In the Night" performed by Edith Fellows.
Plot.
Spoiled teenager Connie Lane (Edith Fellows) has no desire to join her classmates on a two-month vacation at the Smoke River Dude Ranch. Even her caring teacher, Alice Bennett (Fay McKenzie), is unable to persuade her. Connie runs off to her father, business tycoon Randolph Lane (Pierre Watkin), and pleads with him not to send her away. Preoccupied with business matters and too busy to notice how spoiled his daughter has become, Lane dismisses her and sends her away to spend the summer with her classmates at the ranch.
Meanwhile, Smoke River's ex-foreman, Hap Callahan (William Haade), is not pleased with the new foreman, Gene Autry (Gene Autry), and how he turned the place into a dude ranch. Gene reminds him that ranch owner "Skipper" Forbes (Sarah Padden) hired him because Hap's mismanagement drove the ranch into debt. When the train arrives at Smoke River carrying Alice and the girls, Connie bribes the porter to keep her luggage on the train. In the confusion, no one notices that Connie hasn't disembarked until the train pulls away. Gene races after the train on his horse, Champion, and brings the willful youngster back to the ranch.
While Gene and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) compete for Alice's attention, Connie complains about being stuck on an unsophisticated ranch. Despite the best efforts of Alice, Connie quickly manages to turn everyone at the ranch against her—everyone except Gene. The next day, after Hap ignores Gene's order to fix the brakes on the ranch truck, Connie steals the vehicle in another attempt to escape. When the brakes fail and Connie's life is endangered, Gene rides to her rescue, but not before the truck crashes. Instead of being grateful, Connie is angry with Gene for preventing her escape. Looking to exact revenge, she uses lipstick to mark up her back so it looks like she's been whipped, takes photographs of her injuries, and then sends them off to her father.
Later, when she learns that Gene took responsibility for the truck's destruction, a grateful Connie tells him she wants to reward him for the favor. Gene tells her that people should do favors for each other out of friendship, not for rewards. When Gene and Hap stage a contest to determine the better rider, Connie sees her opportunity to repay the favor—she tampers with Hap's saddle. During his ride, the saddle comes loose and Hap is hurt in a fall. When Gene discovers the sabotage, Connie admits to her mischief. Angered by Connie's actions, Hap draws his gun at Gene, who fires him.
Surprised that Gene would come to her defense, Connie is finally won over, and as the weeks pass, the two become good friends. Connie's happiness is short-lived, however, when her father arrives at the dude ranch, enraged by the photographs he received from her. When he demands that she leave with him immediately, she explains that the photos were a prank, but he is unconvinced. After Frog disables his plane and Gene goads him into accompanying them on a roundup, the business tycoon decides to stay.
During the roundup, Lane discovers that he enjoys the outdoors and spending time with his daughter. As the group moves through a narrow mountain pass, Hap shoots at Gene and misses, but the sound causes the horses to stampede. Just as Connie is about to be trampled, Gene rides in and saves her. After they return to the ranch, Lane finally acknowledges that his daughter is more important than his business. Sending his secretaries away, he joins the others on a music-filled hayride.
Production.

High Marnham Test Track

The High Marnham Test Track is a linear railway test track created in 2009 and centred on Lodge Lane, Tuxford, in Nottinghamshire in the United Kingdom. It houses Network Rail's Rail Innovation & Development Centre (RIDC), originally known as the Rail Vehicle Development Centre (RVDC). The main route is approximately long and rated for speeds up to . It is primarily formed of a former section of the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway running between Thoresby Colliery Junction at the western end, and High Marnham Power Station at the eastern end. Additionally a branchline diverges northwards over the Bevercotes Colliery Branch via Boughton Brake Tunnel to Bevercotes.
The main test track passes on a bridge directly over the East Coast Main Line, at the location of the former Dukeries Junction interchange station, but without a rail connection being provided. Instead the test track is accessed from the national British railway network via Shirebrook Junction on the Robin Hood Line and the existing line from there to Thoresby Colliery Junction.
Access for trains is protected by an Annett's key under the supervision of an Engineering Technical Officer. There is no signalling on the line owing to theft and vandalism, including the previous destruction of the Ollerton Colliery signal box.
Re-opening.
On 10 February 2009 975025 "Caroline" visited the line on inspection duties prior to re-opening. Network Rail announced their intention for the reopening between Thoresby Colliery Junction and High Marnham on 10 July 2009. In August 2009 Network Rail stated that because the route of the line would now be maintained, it might increase the likelihood of being able to restore a passenger service in connection with Robin Hood Line services at a later date.
In November 2011 local people were reminded about the operational nature of the test track following acts of trespass.
During 2012 the Branch Line Society announced their intention to run a railtour covering the main test track and special steep gradients; plus the Bevercotes Branch to a distance of . Such a tour ran on 5 January 2013 and was widely reported in the railway enthusiast press.
Facilities.
The test track includes short sections of non-energised 25 kV AC railway electrification and non-energised third/fourth rail, a W6A loading gauge, ERA Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) noise testing.
An area of special track exists for RIS-1530-PLT testing of on-track plant, including lengths of track for brake testing at up to 1:25 and sharp reverse curves. The Lodge Lane area also contains portacabins for visiting staff, and a inspection shed for railway vehicles.
Projects.
In March 2012 braking tests were undertaken for fitments of improved hydraulic brakes to 450 road-rail vehicle excavators. These excavators were all falling under classification "type 9b" where the rubber wheel touch small flanged steel wheels, which in-turn touch the rails and were found to have significantly reduced braking performance in adverse conditions.
In August 2012 the line was used for the testing of RFID and iPad-based "Virtual Lineside Signalling". Funding came from a Department of Transport £100,000-grant to investigate the possibility for low cost system for locations where European Rail Traffic Management System installation is not viable. RFID tags are placed on the track, and contact with a central signalling location is maintained by using encryption over traditional GSM networks and off-the-shelf portal computers used for the cab display.
In October 2013 a new high output "factory train" which will be used on Great Western Main Line electrification is due to be brought from Germany to the test track for trialling and staff familiarisation.

Parade Grounds

The Parade Grounds is a large concrete open area on the south end of Alcatraz Island, off the coast of San Francisco, USA. They lie beyond Building 64. They were originally built in the 1860s on a barren site by the U.S. military who used the site for military drills and parades. 
After the island became a Federal Penitentiary in 1934, the Parade Grounds was used as a playground, especially on weekends and holidays, and was used host special events, often organized by the Officer's Club. As the nearby Building 64 aged and fell into disrepair, the operators of the prison funded several new residential blocks on the square. Gardens were developed around them, and handball and weightlifing facilities developed for the employees and their families. The children living in the quarters on the Parade Ground were known to other children and their families on Alcatraz as "the topside kids" because they lived above those residing in Building 64 on the dock below. 
The island ceased use as a jail in 1963 and the residential buildings and gardens which were added were razed to the ground by the General Services Administration in the 1970s, but the foundation marks can still be seen. Today the grounds are used as a heliport.

Clay Lane is a one kilometre long public footpath and bridle way in Edgware in the London Borough of Barnet. It is a Site of Local Importance for Nature Conservation.
It is an old road, recorded back to 1597, which is now a quiet country lane. The path is lined with ancient hedgerows and there are old oak, field maple and ash treees. Honeysuckle and black bryony provide evidence of the hedgerow's antiquity.
The path skirts Edgwarebury Cemetery, and in 2008 Belsize Square Synagogue applied to extend the cemetery with access across Clay Lane. The application was opposed by members of the London Wildlife Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. who argued that the extension would be environmentally damaging, and in 2009 Barnet Council rejected the application. The London Wildlife Trust applied to have Clay Lane designated a Village Green under the Commons Registration Act, 1965, which would permanently protect it against development. The Synagogue appealed against the rejection, and in 2010 the appeal was successful with a reduction of the crossings of Clay Lane from three to one. The scheme was then carried out.

Bouillon (restaurant)

In France, a bouillon (, ) is a traditional (late 19th or early 20th century), spacious restaurant that usually serves traditional French cuisine, in particular a Bouillon (broth) which has provided the name for this class of restaurants. 
When invented, the concept was to serve good quality food fast and at affordable prices. And in more than a century, not much has changed. 
Today, the buildings of some bouillons are listed historical monuments.
History.
The first bouillons appeared in 1855 thanks to an astute butcher, Pierre Louis Duval. He proposed a single dish of meat and a bouillon (soup/stock) to the workers of the market halls. In 1900, nearly two hundred and fifty bouillons could be found in Paris. They became the first popular chain of restaurants. Some other bouillons, more "upper-class", offered a reading room or some entertainment.
Meanwhile, the charm of Art Nouveau spread through Europe, in architecture, furniture and decoration. The various World's Fairs in Paris 1878, 1889, and 1900, accelerated its influence and the restaurants followed the trend.
In 1903, the first Bouillon Gandon-Duval opened in an old restaurant converted by the owner and architect Edouard Fournier.
In 1904, another bouillon with a luxurious Art Nouveau decoration was opened on Boulevard Saint-Germain. The architect was Jean-Marie Bouvier. Today, it accommodates the restaurant "Le Vagende" which is no bouillon.
It was with Louis Trezel that Edouard Chartier opened two further Bouillons Chartier in 1906: the Grand Bouillon Camille Chartier on Racine Street and the Bouillon Edouard Chartier on Montparnasse Boulevard. These restaurants showed the so characteristic Art Nouveau style : carved wood and ceramics, with mirrors and glass paintings.
Nowadays, only a few authentic bouillons remain, such as the one of the Faubourg-Montmartre and in particular the one in Racine Street which has the most baroque style of Art Nouveau.
Until 1926, Camille Chartier remained the owner of the place. After being called Bouillon Ollé and Joussot, it was Mrs Launois who kept the restaurant until 1956. The following purchaser sold the goodwill to the University of Paris which opened there a restaurant for the staff of the Sorbonne from 1962 until 1993. The major part of the decoration survived but the restaurant did not benefit from the special care allotted to luxurious restaurants.
The complete renovation of the Bouillon Racine took place in 1996 thanks to the Compagnons du Tour de France. It then called upon old expertise of almost lost techniques and skills. Bevelled mirrors, painted opalines, stained glass, carved woodworks, marble mosaics and gold-leaf lettering provide the public with the pleasure of a rich place, as much by its beauty as by its conviviality. It was subsequently classified as an Historic Building.

Brow Monument and Brow Monument Trail

The Brow Monument is a monument listed in the National Register of Historic Places for Coconino County, Arizona, located in the Kaibab National Forest. The site contains one of the few remaining survey markers used by the expedition of John Wesley Powell in 1872. It is accessible via the Brow Monument Trail.
Brow Monument.
The Brow Monument is listed in the National Register of Historic Places for Coconino County, Arizona. It is located on the "brow" of the North Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona within the jurisdiction of the Kaibab National Forest. The National Register designation is to memorialize the John Wesley Powell surveying expedition of 1872. The site consists of one of the few remaining triangulation survey markers that were laid down by Powell's party. They were a key component in being able to calculate distances and topography in the early West by using a baseline and these triangulation points. The baseline for this survey was first laid out near the present-day towns of Fredonia, Arizona, and Kanab, Utah, some 30 miles north of the Brow marker. The survey markers were and continue to this day to also be referred to as "monuments", thus the term "Brow Monument" both defines the physical marker and represents a memorial for the expedition.
The surveying expedition commenced in February 1872 from Kanab, Utah and its base was at the Big Springs, Arizona homestead of Levi Stewart, a pioneer farmer. The first marker at what is today Brow Monument was set at this time. The original markers for this and other surveying expeditions were usually a large pyramid of stones, sometimes a blazed tree, a marked rock, or stacked or cribbed logs, with a red-and-white flag high above to facilitate telescope readings from considerable distances. Combined with information from barometric readings which established elevation above sea level, topographic maps could be drawn. The survey was completed in August of that year. In 1878, G. K. Gilbert, a member of the original surveying team, returned to the area to structurally improve the marker by constructing a wooden crib to support it.
The measurements for the marker were remarkably accurate considering the technology of the time and the rough terrain in which the survey was conducted.
In 1933, a new monument was erected approximately 300 feet uphill from the original site by the U.S. Geological Survey. This new monument is now the official marker to be used in surveying. There is a brass cap survey marker at this new location. The original marker remains undisturbed except for the addition of a memorial plaque.
The historic significance of Brow Monument was officially recognized when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1987.
Brow Monument is mentioned on two maps; the topographic map located in the lobby of the North Kaibab National Forest visitor center in Jacob Lake, Arizona and in the National Forest Service "Kaibab National Forest North Kaibab Ranger District" map.
Brow Monument Trail.
Brow Monument is reachable by foot via the Brow Monument Trail. The trailhead is located within the Kaibab National Forest and can be accessed by two-wheel drive passenger cars (in good weather) although high clearance four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended because of deep ruts and tree-fall on Forest Service roads. Access to the site can be limited in late fall to early spring because of heavy snowfall. The trailhead is shown on the NFS map with directions indicated by signage. From Arizona State Route 67, the trailhead is reached by driving from the Demotte Campground turnoff to Forest Service Road 22 sixteen miles north to Service Road 477, then a quarter-mile west to FS Road 252; after a half-mile FS Road 252 reaches FS Road 252c, which runs one and a half miles to the trailhead (). The trail itself is marked approximately every 200 feet and there is informational signage also along the open ridge walk (see "Gallery" below). The trail is posted as being two miles long, requiring approximately 30 minutes to walk to the Monument () at an average pace.

Vámos matroid

In mathematics, the Vámos matroid or Vámos cube is a matroid over a set of eight elements that cannot be represented as a matrix over any field. It is named after English mathematician Peter Vámos, who first described it in an unpublished manuscript in 1968.
Definition.
The Vámos matroid has eight elements, which may be thought of as the eight vertices of a cube or cuboid. The matroid has rank 4: all sets of three or fewer elements are independent, and 65 of the 70 possible sets of four elements are also independent. The five exceptions are each four-element circuits of the matroid. Four of these five circuits are formed by faces of the cuboid (omitting two opposite faces). The fifth circuit connects two opposite edges of the cuboid, each of which is shared by two of the chosen four faces.
Another way of describing the same structure is that it has two elements for each vertex of the diamond graph, and a four-element circuit for each edge of the diamond graph.

Playing with Fire (NCIS)

"Playing With Fire" is the 22nd episode of the ninth season of the American police procedural drama "NCIS", and the 208th episode overall. It aired on CBS in the United States on May 1, 2012. The episode is written by George Schenck and Frank Cardea and directed by Dennis Smith, and was seen by 17.58 million viewers.
Plot.
In the aftermath of the arson attack aboard the U.S.S Brewer, the NCIS team discovers evidence of it being caused by the same arson explosive from earlier. Fortunately, the explosive went off prematurely only causing minor damage to the ship and two casualties, including the bomber. They also discover that a similar explosive was found on the U.S.S Benjamin Franklin stationed in Naples, Italy. Ziva and DiNozzo team up with NCIS Agent Stan Burley to apprehend the bomber who they manage to capture, though Burley is injured in the process. After interrogation, Gibbs discovers that the mastermind of the bombings is an investment fund CEO named Harper Dearing. After finding out that Dearing has been missing for over a year, Gibbs declares him NCIS' most wanted fugitive.
Meanwhile, Ducky admits to Gibbs that he is in a moral dilemma since he inherited a large sum of money from his deceased mother, but does not know what to do with it. Ultimately, he decides to make Gibbs the executor of his will, and intends to donate much of his newfound wealth to a charity meant to provide scholarships to the children of US Marines.
Production.
"Playing With Fire" is written by George Schenck & Frank Cardea and directed by Dennis Smith. The episode marks the return of NCIS agent Stan Burley (Joel Gretsch). He was last seen in the season 1 episode "High Seas". "Over the years we've discussed bringing back Joel Gretsch as NCIS Special Agent Burley", the writers said. "He appeared in Episode 6, "High Seas." It may be the longest time interval in TV history for a character to reoccur."
The episode also feature Ducky's (David McCallum) will, which include donations to the Marine Corps. Scholarship Foundation. "For several years we've been aware that David McCallum's favorite charity is the Marine Corps. Scholarship Foundation. We finally got a chance to introduce it into a story and explain how it helps the children of Marine veterans."
Reception.
"Playing With Fire" was seen by 17.58 million live viewers following its broadcast on May 1, 2012, with an 11.1/18 share among all households, and 3.1/10 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, "Playing With Fire" easily won "NCIS" and CBS the night. The spin-off "" drew second and was seen by 15.21 million viewers. The episode was the most watched television program the week it aired. Compared to the last episode "Rekindled", "Playing With Fire" was down a bit in viewers and even in adults 18-49.
Steve Marsi from "TV Fanatic" gave the episode 5 (out of 5) and stated "Because of the nature of the deepening mystery, the episode was light on action for most of the hour, but the compelling, perfectly-paced story more than made up for it. When the show commits itself to continuity over multiple weeks like this, the stories are less rushed and often feel more organic."

Political Prisoner's Cross 1940–1945

The Political Prisoner's Cross 1940–1945 (, ) was a Belgian war medal established by royal decree of the Regent on 13 November 1947 and awarded to Belgian citizens arrested and interned by the Germans as political prisoners during the Second World War. The award's statute included provisions for posthumous award should the intended recipient not survive detention, and the right of the widow, the mother or the father of the deceased to wear the cross.
Award description.
The Political Prisoner's Cross 1940–1945 was a 37mm wide silver cross pattée. Its obverse bore a 2 cm in diameter central medallion surrounded by barbed wire with an inverted red enamelled triangle with a black capital "B" at its center. The triangle with the "B" represents the insignia internees had to wear on their prisoners' uniforms identifying them as Belgian political prisoners. The reverse also bore a central medallion, this one though was enamelled in black bearing the years "1940 1945" in silver numerals on two rows.
The cross was suspended by a ring through a suspension loop to a 38mm wide white silk moiré ribbon with six 3mm wide longitudinal blue stripes 3mm apart from each other. These colours represented the striped prisoners' uniforms.
Silver bars with up to four small five or six pointed stars on them could be worn on the ribbon, each star denoting a period of six months of internment. Many veterans though opted for small individual silver stars directly affixed to the ribbon. In the case of a posthumous award, a black enamelled bar was worn on the ribbon above the others.

Suicide squad (New Zealand)

The suicide squad in New Zealand was a so-nicknamed group of New Zealand Legislative Councillors appointed in 1950 by Prime Minister Sidney Holland tasked with voting the New Zealand Legislative Council out of existence.
Abolition of the Upper House.
By the middle of the 20th century, the New Zealand Legislative Council was increasingly being looked on as ineffectual and making little difference to the legislative process. The Legislative Council rarely criticised bills sent to it by the House, and many believed that it was now obsolete. Some favoured its reform, while others favoured its abolition, like the leader of the National Party, Sidney Holland who introduced a private member's bill to abolish it in 1947.
However, because the Parliament of New Zealand was unable to amend the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 (because it was an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament, and the New Zealand Parliament was barred from amending the parts of the Act dealing with the establishment of the Legislative Council) it had to first adopt the Statute of Westminster 1931, which it did with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947. Following the adoption of the Act, the Parliament of New Zealand passed the New Zealand Constitution Amendment (Request and Consent) Act 1947, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1947, allowing the New Zealand Parliament to amend the Constitution Act and abolish the Legislative Council. However, the Labour government did not actually enact the abolition itself, losing office in the 1949 general election.
National formed the new government under party leader Sidney Holland. A key aide to Holland was Clifton Webb, who was appointed to Attorney-General. As Minister of Justice, Webb was responsible for drafting the legislation, the Legislative Council Abolition Act, that resulted in the abolition of the Legislative Council. As nineteen of the existing twenty-five members of the council were known to be opposed to the bill, Holland appointed twenty-five new members, known as the "suicide squad", to vote for their own abolition, just as the Australian state of Queensland had done to abolish its upper house in 1922. They were appointed on 22 June 1950, with four more members appointed on 27 July 1950.
To encourage co-operation from other members, Holland also promised to use the money saved through abolition to set up a fund for retired members. A Statutes Revision Committee (now defunct) was established to carry out some of the scrutiny that the Legislative Council had been intended for. Although abolition was intended as an interim measure, no serious attempts were made to introduce a new second chamber, and Parliament has been unicameral since.
Members of the suicide squad.
List of members of suicide squad; most were appointed on 22.6.1950; one was appointed 15.3.50 (Polson) or 27.7.50 (Allen, Bell, Croker, Marumaru). Thomas Otto Bishop was first appointed on 9 March 1943 and after the expiry of his seven-year term, was reappointed on 15 March 1950; he was thus not part of the intake of new members. All their terms lasted to 31 December 1950.

Fathom.com

Fathom was an online learning portal project, spearheaded by Columbia University, that opened to the public in late 2000. Partners in the venture included the London School of Economics and Political Science, the British Library, the New York Public Library, Cambridge University Press, and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. Failing to turn a profit despite a 2002 business plan change, Fathom closed in early 2003.
Early history.
In the late 1990s, Columbia University, led by executive vice provost Michael M. Crow, sought a way to use the emerging World Wide Web as a strategic tool for extending higher education's reach to the public. The university hired Ann Kirschner in late 1998 to help develop this plan. Over a one-year period starting in January 1999, Crow and Kirschner quickly drew up the blueprint for Fathom, hoping to gain a first-mover advantage over potential competitors.
On April 11, 2000, The Fathom Network Inc. incorporated in Delaware, changing its name to Fathom Knowledge Network Inc. shortly afterward. On November 15, 2000, Fathom opened to the public as a "preview site".
Vision.
Crow and Kirschner conceived Fathom.com as an online learning community for general audiences who desired the experience of "'[...] being at a great university or a great museum'" without having to attend one in person. Concerned by the initial success of Microsoft's "Encarta" encyclopedia, they also saw Fathom as a proactive defense against losing valuable faculty members to other online education projects.
As an Internet hub of educational resources and interactive learning activities, Fathom aimed to distinguish itself from other university-led online learning initiatives. Their plan called for a) a broad range of multimedia educational content designed specifically for the website, not limited to course syllabi and resources (hence the partnership with archival institutions); and b) interactive features such as forums, collaborative learning tools and groups, and expert-led discussions. In these ways, Fathom's ambitions reached beyond the course-confined materials and limited interaction of more familiar online learning initiatives by universities, like MIT's OpenCourseWare.
In regards to Fathom's ambitious scope of content, Fathom's CEO Ann Kirschner is quoted in a press release as saying, "Today, most initiatives by educational institutions are focused on courses. Courses are important, and courses for distance learning will be one of the offerings provided by some partners through Fathom. But learning is not limited to the classroom, and the many other types of content provided through Fathom will provide a more complete and accessible context for knowledge. We believe that Fathom will define the transformation of the online learning category into a broader interactive knowledge marketplace."
The consortium.
As a for-profit consortium, Fathom could compete for highly skilled Web developers, offer students a wide variety of courses, and allow Columbia to cooperate with participating institutions rather than work against them. Although members of the consortium were required to distribute their online content exclusively through Fathom.com, financial contribution was not a condition of membership.
The London School of Economics and Political Science was Columbia's initial partner, followed by Cambridge University Press, the British Library, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, and the New York Public Library. Within six months, seven additional institutions joined the consortium: four US institutions (the University of Chicago, the American Film Institute, the RAND Corporation, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) and three UK museums (the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum). The final member institution, the University of Michigan, joined on November 15, 2000, bringing the total number of member institutions to 14.
Courses offered.
Fathom initially planned to offer only courses produced by its members, which failed to produce courses quickly enough to meet benchmarks set out in its original business plan. Consequently, as announced in September 2000, Fathom decided to allow non-member "content partners", including the University of Florida and the University of Washington, to sell courses through its website.
The specific types and styles of academic courses, marketed using the institutions' brands, varied widely. Courses were text-based yet included primary source documents, animations, interactive graphics, audio slide shows, and streaming videos.
Although Fathom offered many free seminars, some courses cost over $500 and offered credit toward a degree. For example, the "New York Times" reported an "Introduction to Macroeconomics" course from the University of Washington cost $670.
In 2002, Fathom tweaked its business model to generate additional revenue. Specifically, Fathom began to develop non-academic courses in collaboration with organizations as MasterCard International and AARP. Fathom also expanded its focus from degree programs to corporate training and continuing education.
Demise.
Columbia University closed the for-profit corporation on March 31, 2003, keeping the web site's free content online until mid-2012. Although Columbia invested $25 million in the venture, and 65,000 people created accounts, Fathom failed to turn a profit, partly because few customers paid for any of the courses.
Educational technology scholars Bush and Mott cite Fathom as an example of a handful of "very thoughtful educational technology 'solutions,'" including the University of Illinois's Global Campus, which "failed to meet their stated goal of expanding educational opportunities, most likely because they did not align with student needs, and, hence, were not financially viable."

History.
Archaies Kleones was named after the ancient town Cleonae (). It was a city of ancient Argolis, situated on the road from Argos to Corinth. Cleonae was a small town, mainly known for the Nemean Games that took place in its territory. According to mythology, Heracles killed the brothers Eurytus and Cteatus near Cleonae.
Wine region.
Archaies Kleones settlement is located in the Peloponnese in the area of Nemea, approximately 14 kilometers southwest of Corinth. Today, the appellation of Nemea is the most important red wine AOC of southern Greece and arguably of all of Greece. In the region of Nemea, the indigenous Greek Agiorgitiko grape is used and produces wines famous for their deep red color with violet and blue hues, complex aroma and long, velvety palate.

Cameron D-96

The Cameron D-96 was the first hot air airship, a powered, steerable lighter-than-air craft carrying two or three crew marrying the elongated envelope of an airship with the externally localized heat source of a modern hot air balloon. It was designed and built in the UK and first flown in 1973.
Design and development.
Cameron Balloons had been producing hot air balloons for five years when they designed the world's first hot air airship or thermal airship. This, the D-96, has much in common with the balloons, being a non-rigid airship, covered in a nylon fabric and with a propane burner to feed hot air into the envelope from a gondola suspended below it. However, it has the elongated body shape of conventional helium and hydrogen filled airships, airscrew propulsion and stabilizing tailfins. With a length to minimum diameter ratio of only about 2.5, the envelope is fatter than that of many airships. The D-96 is powered a 1.6 L Volkswagen engine, modified to run on propane so that engine and burner use the same fuel. Mounted at the rear of the gondola, this drives a large diameter, partly shrouded propeller. This gondola carries propane fuel and a double burner, the pilot and up to two passengers. Hot air is guided into the envelope by a small, funnel-like extension above the burners.
On 4 January 1973 Don Cameron and Teddy Hall demonstrated the first D-96, registration "G-BAMK", at the Icicle meeting at Newbury, Berkshire. Some records state that this first flight was made on 7 January or over the weekend of 6-7 January. After some initial testing, Cameron's attention returned to balloon manufacture but interest in the airship was revived in 1976 by an order from the U.S.A. The early flights had revealed some directional stability problems, addressed by progressively increasing the number of tailfins. The instabilities were finally cured by a four-finned, cruciform arrangement, with the fins inflated by air from the propeller slipstream, fed from an intake with a tongue-like scoop through a passage along the keel. A rudder, operated from the gondola by cable, was added to the lower fin. At the same time the gondola suspension was improved so that it no longer distorted the envelope.
Originally the D-96 had an envelope capacity of 96,000 cu ft (2,718 m³), as indicated by its name, but during 1978 the envelope was lengthened, increasing the volume by about 7%. This new envelope was used on subsequent production D-96s.
Operational history.
16 D-96s had been built by January 1984 for customers across Europe, in Australia, Canada, U.S.A and Japan; of these, eight appeared on the UK civil aircraft register, though they are all deregistered in 2012. One of these is now on the 2010 French register; another D-96, not previously on the UK register is registered in Spain.

Bipartite matroid

In mathematics, a bipartite matroid is a matroid all of whose circuits have even size.
Example.
A uniform matroid formula_1 is bipartite if and only if formula_2 is an odd number, because the circuits in such a matroid have size formula_3.
Relation to bipartite graphs.
Eulerian matroids were defined by as a generalization of the bipartite graphs, graphs in which every cycle has even size. A graphic matroid is bipartite if and only if it comes from a bipartite graph.
Duality with Eulerian matroids.
An Eulerian graph is one in which all vertices have even degree; Eulerian graphs may be disconnected. For planar graphs, the properties of being bipartite and Eulerian are dual: a planar graph is bipartite if and only if its dual graph is Eulerian. As Welsh showed, this duality extends to binary matroids: a binary matroid is bipartite if and only if its dual matroid is an Eulerian matroid, a matroid that can be partitioned into disjoint circuits.
For matroids that are not binary, the duality between Eulerian and bipartite matroids may break down. For instance, the uniform matroid formula_4 is non-bipartite but its dual formula_5 is Eulerian, as it can be partitioned into two 3-cycles. The self-dual uniform matroid formula_6 is bipartite but not Eulerian.
Computational complexity.
It is possible to test in polynomial time whether a given binary matroid is bipartite. However, any algorithm that tests whether a given matroid is Eulerian, given access to the matroid via an independence oracle, must perform an exponential number of oracle queries, and therefore cannot take polynomial time.

Division Two was reduced from nineteen clubs to eighteen after Bideford Town and Bridgwater Town were promoted to Division One, and Chipping Sodbury and Swindon Town Colts left the league. Three new clubs joined:
1 The system of using goal average to separate two teams tied on points was used up to and including the 1976–77 season.
2 The points system: 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for losing.
3 The tables as published at the time contained errors, hence the totals do not balance in some columns.

Qaummaarviit Territorial Park

Qaummaarviit Territorial Park ("place that shines") is located west of Iqaluit in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada. Situated on a small island near Peterhead Inlet, it is thought that the island was inhabited by the Thule people in the early part of the 13th century.
History.
The area was one of great wildlife diversity which may have attracted the normally marine mammal hunting Thule. The island would have helped them ensure a more stable lifestyle with access to alternate food sources. Although it is estimated that population did not exceed 25 people on the island at a time, more than 3,000 tools and 20,000 bones have been found. The area shows evidence of at least 11 sod houses and there are stone rings and tent remains, which indicates that the island was used both in summer and winter. Although there are few remains today the large number of seal and whale bones suggest that the inhabitants used "umiaks" and "qajaq". In 1860 when Charles Francis Hall visited the area his Inuit guides were able to harvest a large amount of food from there.
Getting there.
The island is accessible from Iqaluit by boat in the summer and by snowmobile, dog sled or skis in the winter. Due to the historic nature of the park camping is not permitted.

Naturama (Futurama)

"Naturama" is the thirteenth episode of the seventh season of the animated sitcom "Futurama". It originally aired on Comedy Central on August 29, 2012.
Plot.
The characters are featured in a nature documentary show called "Wild Universe," divided into three segments. They appear as different animals in each segment with voice-over narration.
Part 1: Salmon.
The characters are depicted as salmon, with the exception of Zoidberg, who appears as a lobster. Fry and Leela, born in different rivers, meet after swimming out to sea, and Leela rejects Zapp Branigan and promises to mate with Fry when they come of age. However, since they must instinctually return to the rivers where they were hatched in order to mate, they are forced to separate. Before Zapp can fertilize Leela's eggs, he is caught and eaten by Brrr, a grizzly bear version of Lrrr. Fry jumps out of his river and over to Leela's; but is stuck on the land adjacent to it. He too is caught by Brrr, who reluctantly lets him go after the grizzly bear version of Ndnd argues with him over eating too much fish. Fry reaches Leela and fertilizes her eggs, and both die along with all the other salmon.
Part 2: The Pinta Island Tortoise.
Professor Farnsworth, as a rare Pinta Island tortoise named Lonesome Hubert, is persuaded by his animal friends to find a mate so his species can continue. The tortoise he is interested in lives on the other side of the island, an 18-month journey. Once Hubert arrives, he mistakenly begins to mate with a large, tortoise-shaped boulder until the real tortoise (resembling Mom) shows up and angrily knocks it down a hill. She has been waiting for Hubert, and the two mate but later part ways after she lays three eggs. Several months later, these hatch into tortoise versions of Walt, Larry and Igner and promptly fall down the hill, where the boulder rolls over and crushes them, leading to the species' extinction.
Part 3: The Elephant Seal.
The alpha male of an elephant seal colony (played by Bender) mates freely with dozens of females, while the less virile males are unable to attract mates. Kif gets Amy's attention and begins to mate with her while Bender is distracted, but Bender discovers them and scares Kif away. Kif challenges Bender for dominance, only to be quickly crushed to death when they fight. However, the other lesser males have taken advantage of the fight and mated without Bender's knowledge, leading to the birth of several pups that look just like them.
Epilogue.
Following the closing title screen of the documentary and a pitch for Mutual of Omicron ("Have you insured your planet?"), a fleet of spaceships destroys Earth.
Reception.
"The A.V. Club" gave this episode a B+.
The season finale had 1.365 million viewers and a 0.7 rating in the (18-49) demo.

USS Firefly (1814)

The USS "Firefly", was a brig with two masts, square-rigged, formerly named "Volant" and originally built as a schooner for use as a privateer. The vessel was purchased at New York by the U.S. Navy on 8 December 1814 and was fitted out as US war ship with 14 guns and used in service during the War of 1812 and Second Barbary War of 1815. "Firefly" was purchased because of the several US blockade efforts where smaller ships with better maneuverability were needed for the task.
History.
In 1814, during the War of 1812, "Firefly" became the flagship of a squadron of five small ships which, under the command of Captain David Porter, were preparing for a mission to the West Indies to capture or destroy enemy commerce, however before the squadron departed the mission was canceled when a peace treaty with Britain was signed on 24 December.
On 20 May 1815, during the Second Barbary War, command of the "Firefly" was given to Lieutenant George W. Rodgers who departed from New York for the Mediterranean to join the squadron of Commodore Stephen Decatur After a few days at sea Rodgers' squadron encountered a heavy gale and the "Firefly" sprung a mast, forcing it to return to port for repairs.
After repairs were completed "Firefly" set sail again for the Mediterranean on 18 July where she joined Commodore William Bainbridge's and Decatur's squadrons at Carthagena where preparations for the mission at Algiers were being made. From there the squadrons sailed to Algiers and spend the next several months maintaining the blockade and enforcing the peace concluded with the Dey of Algiers by Commodore Decatur and William Shaler, US Consul to Algiers.
On 15 November 1815 "Firefly" arrived with the squadron at Newport, R.I., then sailed on to New York where she was laid up at the navy yard where she was later sold at public auction on 3 April 1816 at New York.

List of Judson Dance Theater performers

Judson Dance Theater was an informal group of dancers who performed at the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, Manhattan New York City between 1962 and 1964. It grew out of a dance composition class taught by Robert Dunn, a musician who had studied with John Cage. The artists involved were "avant garde" experimentalists who rejected the confines of Modern dance practice and theory, inventing as they did the precepts of Postmodern dance. 
The first Judson concert took place on July 6, 1962.
This is a list of all artists (dance artists, musicians, visual arts) who were a part of the Judson Dance Theater between 1962 and 1966:

In their retrospective review, Allmusic asserted that the front cover of "Schemer-Dreamer" "very well could be the greatest album cover in rock history."

TextDrive

Joyent was founded in 2004 under the name TextDrive by the Canadian typographer, art director, designer, writer and programmer Dean Allen, the creator of Textile markup, who was looking to create an ideal hosting environment for the content management system he was developing, Textpattern. TextDrive was incorporated in California in May 2004 with Allen as Chief Executive Officer and Jason Hoffman as President and Chief Operating Officer. TextDrive was positioned as "a hosting company run by and for people who love publishing on the web."
Lifetime hosting crisis at Joyent, relaunch and shutdown of TextDrive.
On August 16, 2012, individuals who had provided start-up and development funding to Joyent (and its predecessor, TextDrive) in exchange for lifetime shared hosting accounts with Joyent were informed, via email, that their lifetime hosting accounts would be deleted on October 31, 2012. Depending on the nature of their initial investment, they were offered either one or three free years of hosting on a Joyent SmartMachine, the company's cloud hosting solution, after which they would be moved to a regularly billed account. Customer backlash to the announcement turned out to be fierce.
On August 30, 2012, TextDrive co-founder Dean Allen announced that he was relaunching TextDrive as a separate company which will carry on Joyent's shared hosting business and honor the "lifetime" agreements. Allen relaunched TextDrive in late 2012 using Joyent infrastructure. At the time, he was confident he would succeed in building a viable business similar to DreamHost.
On March 3, 2014, Dean Allen announced the shutdown of TextDrive: 
As anyone looking for decent support or even useful information over the past few months can attest, the revival of TextDrive has not been a success.
What began in mid-2012 as an exciting challenge fuelled by good intentions and lean resources quickly turned into a cleanup project with almost no resources.
It is disappointing to report that after a year and a half of uphill battles and unimagined setbacks, after several costly efforts to regroup and find another way, options to keep TextDrive growing have run out, and we will cease operations on the 14th of March, 2014.
For those who wish to know, details of what went wrong will be made available once shutdown operations have completed.
Sorry to have let you down.

HMS Rosario (1808)

HMS "Rosario" was a "Cherokee"-class 10-gun brig of the Royal Navy, launched in 1808. She served during the Napoleonic Wars and participated in one engagement that earned her crew the NGSM. She was sold in 1832. 
Napoleonic Wars.
She was commissioned in March 1809, under commander Booty Harvey, for service in home waters. On 10 December 1810, she engaged two French privateers in the English Channel. To avoid being captured, Harvey ran alongside one of the luggers, which he boarded and captured. This was the lugger "Mamelouck" of 16 guns, under the command of Norbez Lawrence. The other lugger engaged "Rosario" on the starboard side but then was able to outrun "Rosario", which had lost her jib-boom during the boarding, and escape. "Mamelouck" had seven of her crew of 45 men wounded. "Rosario" had five men wounded, two severely. "Mamelouck" was only nine hours out of Boulogne and had not had captured anything.
On 19 December 1811, "Rosario" was in company with and when "Royalist" captured the French privateer "Rodeur", of 14 guns and 60 men, between Dover and Calais after a two-hour chase. In the engagement "Royalist" had one man killed and five wounded; "Rodeur" lost one man killed and 11 wounded.
On 27 March 1812, near Dieppe, "Rosario" intercepted a 13-strong flotilla heading from Boulogne to Dieppe. With the aid of HMS "Griffon", she engaged them closely, capturing three brigs (praams Nos. 95, 246, and 314), and driving two more onto the shore. Each French brig was armed with three 24-pounder guns and an 8" howitzer. The British casualties amounted to officer and four men wounded. On 31 March, as a result, Harvey was promoted to post-captain. In 1847, the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp "Rosario 27 March 1812" to the seven surviving claimants from her crew. The admiralty also awarded the medal with clasp "Griffon 27 March 1812" to the five surviving claimants from that vessel.
William Henderson assumed command of "Rosario". Thomas Ladd Peake replaced Henderson in June 1813.
Anti-smuggling duty.
Based in Portsmouth, "Rosario" spent the following years patrolling the coast. 
On 18 April 1816, "Rosario" was in company with the schooner HMS "Grecian" captured the smuggling vessel "Nancy". Then on 4 June "Rosario" captured the "Charlotte", which had a three-man crew and was smuggling 85 kegs of spirits. Six weeks later, on 17 July, "Rosario" picked up 200 kegs of contraband spirits at sea.
On 12 January 1817, she seized the "Ino", a smuggling boat loaded with 144 kegs of spirits. In March 1818, she went to the aid of the merchantman "Kingston"; her crew were later given a reward of £168.
In 1819, "Rosario" came under the command of William Hendry. She then returned to anti-smuggling duties. On 14 May 1819 she captured the sloop "Providence", and then five days later, the open boat "Fly". Lastly, on 25 June, she seized 98 gallons of spirits. "Rosario" then transferred to the St. Helena station. 
Following the death of Napoleon in May 1821, Frederick Marryat was appointed to command her and carry the dispatches announcing Napoleon's death to England. Between 20 September and 8 December Marrayat and "Rosario" made "sundry captures".
Fate.
"Rosario" was paid off in February 1822. The Admiralty advertised that they were putting her up for sale on 22 August 1832 at Portsmouth. She was sold to J. Levy of Rochester for £380 in November 1832.

Jones-Costigan amendment

The Jones-Costigan Amendment, also known as the Sugar Act of 1934, was an amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act that reclassified sugar crop as basic commodity, subject to the provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act enacted the previous year. Sponsored by Senator Edward P. Costigan (Progressive, Colorado) and Representative John Marvin Jones (Democrat, Texas), the act was a New Deal effort to salvage an ailing sugar industry by imposing protective tariffs and quotas along with a direct subsidy to growers of sugar cane and sugar beet.
Background.
Declining agricultural prices preceded the Stock Market Crash of 1929, commonly associated with the start of the worldwide Great Depression that lasted through the 1930s. By 1931, sugar prices had fallen from a pre-Depression level of 7 cents per pound to just one and one half cents per pound.
The US market for sugar was the largest in the world, consuming some 6,000,000 tons per year. Of this, the US sugar industry supplied only about a third, while the rest consisted of foreign imports. Within the US itself, sugar production was divided between two industries; sugar cane producers along the coast and on Caribbean and Pacific islands, and sugar beet producers on the mainland. 
In the early 20th century, sugar beet workers were primarily Polish, Belgian, and Hungarian immigrant families. Following the Immigration Act of 1924, which cut off most European immigration, growers turned to workers of Mexican descent. The trend became still more widespread when American Federation of Labor organized beet workers struck for higher wages in Blissfield Michigan in 1935. These workers migrated from Texas and included individuals who had been born on US soil, those who had entered the US legally and those who lacked legal resident standing. Regardless of citizenship status, maltreatment of these workers was widespread by both employers and government authorities. Employer intimidation was commonplace and workers were often fined for made-up infractions so as not to receive even the low pay they had been promised. Overcrowding and unsanitary living conditions were pervasive. Such conditions received growing attention as public health departments became burdened with the cost of care and quarantine. In Saginaw Michigan the Mexican population, accounting for just one and one half percent of the population, suffered 25% of all tuberculosis cases, at a cost to the county of some $18,000 in 1937. 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt outlined Six objectives of the Jones-Costigan Act: 1) To ensure “fair returns” to sugar beet and sugar cane producers. This was to be achieved through a two-pronged approach of limiting the sugar supply to aid in a recovery of market prices, and a direct subsidy to be given to sugar producers. 2) To assure laborers in the sugar industry a share in the benefits of the program, by conditioning benefits on the elimination of child labor and the payment of wages deemed fair and equitable. 3) To stabilize sugar prices by limiting production. 4) To “stabilize” or limit sugar production in the Philippines, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands at levels commensurate with US demand. 5) To stop the decline of Cuban sugar exports to the US. This was also to serve to rejuvenate Cuban consumption of American goods. 6) To enable the Secretary of Agriculture to mediate disputes between growers, processors, and laborers. 
The Act authorized the Federal Surplus Relief Commission to purchase surplus beet sugar using proceeds from the processing tax. This sugar was used in foods distributed to the unemployed, in an attempt to alleviate widespread hunger.
Impact.
Citing increased returns to both sugar growers and processors, wage increases, and the near elimination of child labor in the industry, while consumer prices rose modestly but did not exceed levels comparable to pre-Depression levels, Roosevelt declared the program a short-term success. US exports to Cuba increased 140% from 1933 to 1935 under a reciprocal trade agreement that lowered trade barriers between the US and Cuba. 
In an effort to protect mainland sugar growers, the Jones-Costigan Act imposed quotas on both Caribbean nations under the American sphere of influence and American territories themselves. Outraged by these restrictions, Hawaiian plantation owners began issuing calls for statehood.
Criticism.
Despite early recovery in Cuba, critics noted that the nature of the quota, which was reset each year and subject to considerable change, disrupted the whole of the Cuban economy, dominated as it was by the single crop. Due to the high fixed cost of planting sugar cane, a planter would need several years to recover outlays and earn a profit. Yet, with no guarantee of a market for additional sugar yields, investment was lower than it would have been under a system in which planters could make accurate long-term assessments of demand. Prices rose from the implementation of the act, and dispute exists about whether this was a good or bad outcome. One critic noted in 1956 that the typical American consumer continued to pay some 50% more for sugar than did the average consumer in the world market. 
Among the harshest criticisms was a 1961 allegation that the Jones-Costigan Act had established “a government-created cartel that goes well beyond the controls imposed in any other sector of American private enterprise.”
United States v. Butler.
The 1934 version of the Jones-Costigan Act was overturned in 1936 when the Supreme Court ruled the Agricultural Adjustment Act unconstitutional in United States v. Butler. The bill contained a subsidy for growers, supported by a tax levied on processors. In the case of sugar, the tax amounted to one half cent per pound. It was the imposition of this tax that Justice Robert Owens cited as unconstitutional. Congress reaffirmed the tariff and quota portions of the bill the same year, and adopted a new Sugar Act in 1937. The period 1933 to 1937 saw a fierce battle for power between the president and the Supreme Court, during which the court struck down numerous provisions of the New Deal. This came to a head in 1937 with the proposal of a Judicial Procedures Reform Bill commonly known as the Court Packing Scheme. Frustrated by what he regarded as obstructionism by the Supreme Court, Roosevelt threatened simply to appoint additional Justices sympathetic to his programs, whose votes would override those of the sitting justices. The proposal never came to pass, but the court became more docile. The 1937 Sugar Act stood.

8th Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)

The 8th Cavalry Brigade was a cavalry brigade of the British Army in World War I. It was formed in Belgium in 1914 and served on the Western Front as part of the 3rd Cavalry Division. It left the 3rd Cavalry Division on 14 March 1918.
World War I.
Formation.
The 3rd Cavalry Division began forming at Ludgershall, Wiltshire in September 1914 with just two cavalry brigades (the 6th and the 7th). To bring the division up to the standard strength of three brigades, the 8th Cavalry Brigade was formed in Belgium on 20 November 1914. With the addition of its third brigade, 3rd Cavalry Division obtained a third Cavalry Field Ambulance (8th, from England on 23 December) and a third Mobile Veterinary Section (20th, from England on 9 March 1915). 
The Brigade was initially formed with the 10th Royal Hussars from 6th Cavalry Brigade and the Royal Horse Guards from 7th Cavalry Brigade on 20 November. The third regiment, the Essex Yeomanry, did not join from the Eastern Mounted Brigade in England until 11 December. A signal troop joined on formation and G Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (six 13 pounders) joined from V Brigade, RHA of 8th Infantry Division on 25 November. On 29 February 1916, a Machine Gun Squadron was formed from the machine gun sections of the brigade's constituent regiments.
Chronicle.
The brigade served with the 3rd Cavalry Division on the Western Front until March 1918. It joined the division too late to take part in any of the 1914 actions, but in 1915 the division saw action in the Second Battle of Ypres (Battle of Frezenberg Ridge, 11–13 May) and the Battle of Loos (26–28 September). 1916 saw no notable actions, but in 1917 the division took part in the Battle of Arras (First Battle of the Scarpe, 9–12 April). At other times, the brigade formed a dismounted unit and served in the trenches (as a regiment under the command of the brigadier).
In March 1918, the 4th (formerly 1st Indian) and 5th (formerly 2nd Indian) Cavalry Divisions were broken up in France. The Indian elements were sent to Egypt where they formed part of the new 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions which played a major part in the successful conclusion of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The British and Canadian units remained in France and most of them were transferred to the 3rd Cavalry Division causing it to be extensively reorganized.
The yeomanry regiments were concentrated in the 8th Cavalry Brigade; it left the 3rd Cavalry Division on 14 March 1918, the day after the Canadian Cavalry Brigade joined from 5th Cavalry Division. It appears to have been dissolved at this point as the constituent regiments (the Essex, Leicestershire and North Somerset Yeomanry) were slated to be converted to cyclist units, G Battery, RHA was posted to XVII Brigade, RHA, and 8th MG Squadron joined 7th Cavalry Brigade.
Commanders.
The 8th Cavalry Brigade had the following commanders:

Saucy Sue

Saucy Sue (1922–1937) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare, best known for winning two Classics in 1925. The filly won eight times from ten races in a racing career which lasted from July 1924 until October 1925. She was the top-rated British two-year-old of either sex in 1924, when she was unbeaten in three races. In her first two races the following year she won the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket and the Epsom Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse a month later. Saucy Sue took her unbeaten run to seven by winning the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood. She was defeated in her next two races and was retired from racing at the end of the season after a final win in the Atalanta Stakes at Sandown Park. She had some success as a broodmare and died in 1937.
Background.
Saucy Sue was a bay mare with a white blaze and one white sock on her left hind foot. She was bred by her owner Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor, an American-born politician and newspaper proprietor. Saucy Sue's sire, Swynford, was a successful racehorse and stallion, winning the St Leger Stakes in 1910 and becoming British Champion sire in 1923. Her dam, Good and Gay, was a daughter of Lord Astor's broodmare Popinjay, and therefore a half-sister of the Caulfield Cup winner Magpie. Popinjay's other descendants have included the 2000 Guineas winners Pay Up and Shadeed, the St Leger winners Book Law and Provoke, and the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner Swale.
Astor sent the filly into training with Alec Taylor, Jr. at his stables at Manton in Wiltshire. The Bloodstock Breeders'Review described her as "somewhat plain-looking" at rest but also said that she possessed "a wonderful action and a great, sweeping stride". Before her win in the Oaks, one correspondent called her "greyhoundish" in appearance, but with "immense power".
Racing career.
1924: two-year-old season.
In 1924 Saucy Sue was unbeaten, winning all three of her races by wide margins. She began by winning the five furlong Lavant Stakes at Goodwood in July. In October she won the Bretby Stakes at Newmarket and the Criterion Stakes at the same course two weeks later. She reportedly won the latter race very easily at odds of 1/4 and was described as "one of the smartest two-year-olds in England".
At the end of the season, at the instructions of the Jockey Club, the inaugural Free Handicap, a rating of the year's best juveniles was published. Saucy Sue was assigned top weight of 127 pounds, one pound ahead of the leading colt Picaroon, who had won the Middle Park Stakes and was also trained by Alec Taylor. The Manton stables housed another leading two-year-old filly in the form of the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Miss Gadabout: like Saucy Sue she was owned and bred by Lord Astor and was a grand-daughter of Popinjay.
1925: three-year-old season.
Saucy Sue began her three-year-old season in the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course on 3 May. Ridden by the Australian jockey Frank Bullock, she started at odds of 1/4 against ten opponents, making her the shortest priced favourite since 1904. She was never in any danger of defeat and won by six lengths from Miss Gadabout, with Firouze Mahal two lengths further back in third. According to descriptions of the race she won the race with her ears pricked and her mouth hanging open as her jockey struggled to restrain her. The win gave the forty-year-old Bullock a first classic win in what was to be his final season as a jockey. After the race he described Saucy Sue was the most remarkable horse he had ever ridden and said that she had won without ever traveling at more than half-speed.
Twenty-six days later, Saucy Sue was made 30/100 favourite for the Oaks in a field of twelve fillies. Ridden again by Bullock she pulled hard in the early stages as her jockey tried to restrain her and ran wide at the turn into the straight as her bit slipped through her mouth. Once Bullock allowed her to gallop freely however, she quickly went clear of the field and won by very easily by eight lengths from Miss Gadabout, who was in turn eight lengths clear of the rest. Her winning time of 2:38.2 was more than two seconds faster than that recorded by the Derby winner Manna over the same course and distance two days earlier. Following the win, she was described in the press as the best filly seen in Britain since Pretty Polly.
At Royal Ascot in June, Saucy Sue was brought back in distance to one mile for the Coronation Stakes and started at odds of 1/10. Carrying a weight of 136 pounds, she won the race by ten lengths "in a canter" from Inca and two others. A heel injury forced Saucy Sue to miss a run against colts and older horses in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, but she returned later in the month to win the Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood.
On 12 September, Saucy Sue was stepped up in distance for the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Taylor's original intention had been to run the filly in the St Leger at the same meeting, but plans were revised after she was beaten by Picaroon in a trial race at Manton. She was beaten for the first time as she finished third of the four runners, beaten twelve lengths by the Aga Khan's filly Juldi. In her next race she finished third to the colts Conquistador and Warden of the Marches in the Royal Stakes at Newmarket on 17 October, leading some commentators to offer the opinion that she had been over-rated as a result of wins against an unusually weak crop of three-year-old fillies. Saucy Sue ended her career with a win in late October as she defeated five opponents in the ten furlong Atalanta Stakes at Sandown. Saucy Sue's earnings of £22,155 for the year enabled Lord Astor to claim the title of British flat racing Champion Owner for the 1925 season.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Saucy Sue a "superior" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks and the twentieth best filly trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century.
Stud record.
As a broodmare, Saucy Sue produced a good colt in Truculent, sired by Teddy, who won the Royal Standard Stakes at Manchester Racecourse and made a promising start as a breeding stallion before dying in 1937 at the age of ten.

Astafjorden

Astafjorden is a fjord (more accurately, a strait) in Troms county, Norway. It flows through the municipalities of Salangen, Gratangen, Ibestad, and Skånland. The long fjord flows from the Salangen fjord in the east to the Vågsfjorden in the west. The wide fjord separates the islands of Andørja and Rolla from the mainland. There are several small fjords that branch off this fjord including: Lavangen, Gratangen, Grovfjorden, and Salangen.
Name.
The fjord (and the former municipality of Astafjord) were named after the old "Ånstad" farm (Old Norse: "Arnastaðafjǫrðr"). The first element of the old name comes from the male name "Arna" or "Arne", the second element "staða" means "home" or "farm", and the last element "fjǫrðr" is identical with the word for "fjord". Thus, the fjord by Arne's farm.

Ruth Goldbloom

Ruth Miriam Goldbloom, , , DLit (née Schwartz, December 5, 1923 – August 29, 2012) was a Canadian philanthropist who co-founded the Pier 21 museum in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She was born and raised in New Waterford, Nova Scotia, to immigrant parents. Their immigrant experience influenced her throughout her life and was a major factor in her helping to found Pier 21. She became the first Jew to Chair Mount Saint Vincent University's board, which was a Catholic women's university at the time. She was the chancellor of the Technical University of Nova Scotia in the 1990s and fundraising chair for the Halifax area United Way. She was inducted into the Order of Canada for her work with charities in the 1980s and 1990s.
Early life.
Goldbloom was born and raised as Ruth Miriam Schwartz, in New Waterford, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Her grandparents and parents immigrated to Canada from the Pale of Settlement, Russian Empire, with their immigrant experience influencing her throughout her life. She attended both Mount Allison University and McGill University. She met Richard Goldbloom at McGill, and married him in 1946. They moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, from Montreal in 1967 with their family.
Community work.
When Goldbloom moved to Halifax in 1967 with her husband and family, she began to get involved in the community. She was a fundraising chair for the Izaak Walton Killam Children's Hospital, where her husband was the Physician-in-Chief. She became a fundraiser for Mount Saint Vincent University, at the time a women only Catholic institution. In the 1980s, she became the first Jew to chair the University's board. In 1989, she became the first chairwoman of the Halifax United Way's annual fundraising drive. She served as the Chancellor for the Technical University of Nova Scotia before it merged with Dalhousie University. She became a fundraiser for the Cape Breton Regional Hospital in 2009. She and her husband were also involved with the Arts community, and they helped support Symphony Nova Scotia and its precursor the Atlantic Symphony Orchestra.
Pier 21.
Goldbloom co-founded the Pier 21 Society in 1990, which eventually established the Pier 21 Museum. She spearheaded the fundraising efforts to raise $16 million to build a new museum at the pier, which opened in 1999. In 2009, the year that Pier 21 was designated a National Museum of Immigration, Goldbloom noted that she always wanted it "to become the second museum outside of Ottawa to be a national museum of immigration." Pier 21 operated as an ocean liner terminal and immigration entry point from 1928 to 1971. It was converted to the Pier 21 museum in 1999 and became Canada's National Museum of Immigration in 2009, with Goldbloom present as the Prime Minister announced the museum's new status.
Awards.
She was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 1992 for her fundraising work at the Halifax United Way and at Mount Saint Vincent University. She was later promoted to an Officer of the Order of Canada in April 2000 for her work at Pier 21 and as Chancellor of the Technical University of Nova Scotia. Goldbloom was awarded the Order of Nova Scotia in 2008 for her volunteer work in social, religious and heritage organizations in that province. She was awarded seven honorary doctorate degrees from Dalhousie University, Mount Saint Vincent University, Nova Scotia Community College, Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Mount Allison University, University of King's College, and Acadia University. As well, she was awarded numerous awards from Jewish organizations, and community groups.
Goldbloom died from cancer on August 29, 2012, aged 88. She was survived by her husband, Dr. Richard Goldbloom, three children, seven grandchildren and four great grand children. A large public funeral was held next to Pier 21 at the Cunard Centre, with the premier of Nova Scotia, Darrell Dexter; Lt. Governor John James Grant; other government officials and prominent people in attendance.

Havard is most recognized for the paranormal romance series, "The Survivors", a five book series featuring history, mythology, and paranormal beings like witches, vampires, and shapeshifters.
Early life.
Amanda Havard was born in Shreveport, Louisiana to L.C. and Anneal Havard. She grew up in Dallas, TX and attended the Parish Episcopal School and the Hockaday School for girls. Upon graduation, Havard attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee where she received her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Early Childhood Development from the top-ranked Peabody College of Education and Human Development. Havard now resides in Nashville, Tennessee.
"The Survivors" Series.
"The Survivors".
"The Survivors" was published on March 28, 2011 by independent publisher Chafie Press. The idea for the series came to life in June 2009 while Havard was driving to a friend's wedding in Tupelo, Mississippi. The writing process for the first book took only 27 days from idea to end while Havard was still obtaining her advanced degree from Vanderbilt University. "The Survivors" is also the pilot version of the Immersedition™ book app. The Immersedition™ version includes original music (written by Havard), maps, photos, music videos, historical and mythological background information, author commentary, and other relevant additions to the story world. "The Survivors" was also released in syndication on Wattpad throughout 2011 and has received over 5 million reads.
In "The Survivors", readers follow a dark protagonist, Sadie Matthau, on her quest for answers about her supernatural family and, essentially, immortality. Her family are survivors of the Salem Witch Trials that were exiled instead of executed who happened to survive due to supernatural abilities. In order to find the secrets kept by her family, Sadie finds other supernatural beings, including Everett Winter and his family of veiczy (vampires), and proof of impending danger to her family.
"The Survivors" was a recipient of Independent Publisher's 2011 Editor’s Choice Award, the 2011 Moonbeam Children’s Book Award bronze medal for Young Adult Horror/Mystery, US Review of Books’ Eric Hoffer Lit Award 1st Runner-Up (YA), and eLit Awards' bronze medal in Young Adult and bronze medal in Fantasy/Sci-Fi.
"Point of Origin".
"Point of Origin" is the second book in "The Survivors" series and was published on June 10, 2012. The second book picks up quickly where "The Survivors" ended and immediately poses more questions and theories behind Sadie and her family's existence.
"Point of Origin" was awarded the "Review Direct" Title of Special Note.
"Body & Blood".
"Body & Blood" is the third book in "The Surviviors" series and is expected to be released on July 23, 2013.
Creative Director.
In 2011, Havard was named Creative Director of Immersedition™. The idea behind the Immersedition™ interactive book app was essentially Havard's own creation, for which, the transmedia studio was created to produce the app and its content, including writing and recording original music, video production, and all other content production.
Fiction.
The first Immersedition™ of Havard's own work, "The Survivors" showcases the potential behind the platform. Havard has spoken on several media and transmedia panels across the country on the future of storytelling via multiple platforms and especially interactive books, including Digital Hollywood, Mediabistro's Pub App Expo, UtopYACon, and the New York Film Festival (2012). In April 2012, "Wired" (magazine) featured Havard and Immersedition™ among the independent publishers "leading the way" in the development of interactive books.
Education.
Havard recently spearheaded an educational Immersedition™ project using William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet intended for classroom usage in schools. The educational tool will "provide a way to guarantee high quality, thought-provoking information and discussion to anyone who reads the book." The first educational Immersedition™ is currently pending release.
Songwriting.
Havard has written and co-written multiple songs that have been performed and produced to accompany the "The Survivors" series. Havard used songwriting as a tool throughout the writing process to help articulate key scenes.
"Pretty Girl".
The first song written by Havard and Deanna Walker (songwriter and songwriting professor at Vanderbilt University) was "Pretty Girl" performed by "The Voice" Season 2 finalist, Chris Mann. "Pretty Girl" was released in April 2011 and was written from the perspective of the male lead, Everett Winter.
"Breaking".
The second single written for the series was co-written by Havard and Walker and titled "Breaking".

Harris S. Richardson

Harris Sawyer Richardson (January 10, 1887 – February 17, 1976) was an American politician who served as President of the Massachusetts Senate from 1948 to 1949 and again in 1950.
Early life.
Richardson was born on January 10, 1887 in Vershire, Vermont. As a young boy he moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts. He attended Harvard College but dropped out during his senior year to take over the family grocery business following the death of his father.
Political career.
Richardson's political career began in Winchester, Massachusetts, where he served on many town boards. He was a member of the Finance Committee from 1926 to 1929, the Board of Selectmen from 1929 to 1931, and the Planning Board from 1936 to 1961. He also served on the Board of Appeal and as a Town Meeting member.In 1936 he was elected to the Massachusetts Senate.
Senate Presidency.
During recess in 1947, Senate President Donald W. Nicholson was elected to the United States House of Representatives. When the Senate reconvened in January, Richardson was elected President.
The 1948 Massachusetts Senate elections resulted in the election of 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats. The Republicans proposed an arrangement in which each party would have control over the Senate for half of the term. The Democrats refused to accept this proposal with Democratic Senate leader Chester A. Dolan, Jr. stating that after the election of a Democratic Governor, a Democratic majority in the State House of Representatives, and an increased number of Democratic State Senators "If the Republican leaders have not heard the voice of the people by this time they must be deaf." The Senate met for the first time at 11 am on January 5, 1949. The adjourned at 3:45 am the next day, still deadlocked after record 33 ballots. The stalemate finally ended on January 27 after 114 total ballots when the two sides agreed to have Dolan serve as President in 1949 and Richardson serve in 1950. As part of the agreement, the Democrats received a majority on the Senate Ways and Means Committee for the full two years and all of the Republican-appointed employees of the Senate were assured of their jobs.
In 1950, Richardson ran for Lieutenant Governor. He finished third in the Republican primary.
Death.
Richardson died on February 17, 1976 in Winchester.

2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series

The 2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season was the 65th season of professional stock car racing in the United States. The season began on February 16, 2013, at Daytona International Speedway, with the Sprint Unlimited, followed by the Daytona 500 on February 24. The season ended with the Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway on November 17.
The 2013 season was the first season using the Generation 6 race car, the Car of tomorrow's successor, and marked the return to the qualifying procedure that was used before the 2005 season. However, at the two road courses on the schedule drivers qualified in groups instead of single laps. In September 2012, NASCAR removed a ban introduced in the 2008 season on testing at tracks that were on any of the premier series' schedules, replacing it with a testing limit.
Chevrolet entered the season as the reigning Manufacturer's Champions, while Brad Keselowski was the reigning Drivers' Champion. However, because Keselowski failed to make the Chase, he was unable to defend his title.
Teams and drivers.
Team changes.
Penske Racing changed their manufacturer to Ford after being with Dodge since 2003. Penske had collaborated with the Ford corporation from 1994 through 2002. During the off-season, Inception Motorsports was purchased by Swan Energy Inc. CEO Brandon Davis, renaming the team to Swan Racing. However, David Stremme remained as the driver of the team's car. Tommy Baldwin Racing changed the number of their primary car from 36 to 7 in honor of former Modified Series driver Tom Baldwin, Sr., the father of team owner Tommy Baldwin, Jr. During the season, James Finch announced that he would sell Phoenix Racing, and that his final race as owner of the team would be the Crown Royal presents the Samuel Deeds 400 at the Brickyard.
Driver changes.
The 2013 season saw several driver changes. Ricky Stenhouse, Jr., entered the series from Nationwide Series to replace Matt Kenseth, who decided not to renew his contract with Roush Fenway Racing after his fourteenth season with the team. Kenseth later replaced Joey Logano in the No. 20 at Joe Gibbs Racing. Logano, who had been racing for Joe Gibbs Racing since the 2008 season, replaced A. J. Allmendinger – who had been suspended from the series in July 2012 – and his temporary replacement Sam Hornish, Jr. at Penske Racing. Furniture Row Racing chose not to retain Regan Smith, instead choosing the 2004 season champion, Kurt Busch for the 2013 season, and for the final six races of the 2012 season. Busch was previously with the Phoenix Racing team during the 2012 season. Smith later moved to the Nationwide Series to drive for the JR Motorsports team for the 2013 season. Afterward, Phoenix Racing announced that Smith would drive in the 2013 Daytona 500 for the team. After conflicts arose over payment for 2012 and 2013, Landon Cassill left BK Racing. David Reutimann, who drove for the team in the Daytona 500 and at Darlington during 2012, drove the No. 83 full-time instead. Cassill later joined Circle Sport.
Schedule.
The final calendar was released on September 25, 2012, containing 36 races, with the addition of two exhibition races. The schedule also includes two Budweiser Duels, which are the qualifying races for the Daytona 500.
Schedule changes.
The 2013 schedule differentiated slightly from the 2012 season. The fall Chase races at Kansas Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway (Hollywood Casino 400 and the Good Sam Club 500) returned to their original positions on the schedule because of the completion of Kansas Speedway's reconfiguring project.
Changes.
Generation 6 car.
In preparation for the 2013 season, NASCAR allowed the manufacturers participating in the series to develop a new car that resembles the production models. Areas of the car that were allowed to be changed were the area above the doors, hood and truck lid.
Ford was the first to announce their 2013 car on January 24, 2012, with the Ford Fusion; however, the company modified the car in June 2012 by designing a new grille and hood lines. Afterward, Dodge revealed their 2013 Dodge Charger, while Chevrolet announced that the Chevrolet Impala would no longer race in the series, instead the Chevrolet SS, which is expected to go into production in 2014, would. On May 22, 2012, Toyota announced that the Toyota Camry would continue to be their race model for the 2013 season.
On July 30, 2012, NASCAR approved each of the manufacturer's design after the results of the final aerodynamic test, allowing them to begin making parts for the cars. The new cars are expected to premiere in the 2013 Daytona Speedweeks. Dodge announced on August 7, 2012, that it would not participate in the series during the 2013 season after recording 55 victories in the previous eleven years.
To benefit the safety of the drivers, NASCAR improved the roll cage that surrounds the driver after a large amount testing in the NASCAR Research and Development Center. The improvement features a new forward roof bar and center roof support bar that intersects in the center of the front section of the roll cage. NASCAR later released cosmetic changes to the 2013 car, including the driver's last name on the windshield, the sponsor's logo placed on the roof, the team logo being moved from the headlights to the front bumper, and the reduction in size of contingency decals and car numbers due to the smaller size of the car. During the Autoweek's Racing Conference in Detroit, Michigan, NASCAR announced that the manufacturer logos will be placed on either side of the drivers' name to increase manufacturer identity.
Starting with the Subway Fresh Fit 500, the roof camera was removed for approximately two-thirds of points races to lessen turbulent air impact, though tracks like Daytona International Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, Sonoma Raceway and Watkins Glen International retained the cameras.
Rule changes.
After banning all testing on tracks where any of the three premier series sanction races in 2008, NASCAR announced on September 29, 2012, that they will implement limited testing at tracks which sanction a race on the schedule. However, NASCAR stated that each organization is only allowed to test four different times, with each test at a different track. Rookie of the Year participants were allowed one extra test session, while NASCAR chose two other events for extra testing during the race weekend. NASCAR changed the car inspection process as well. The new process involves a laser mechanism which scans different parts of the car. Teams were first introduced to this new inspection process during the Talladega Superspeedway and Martinsville Speedway testing. It was also used during preseason testing at Charlotte Motor Speedway to make sure it doesn't have any problems.
Furthermore, NASCAR removed the top-35 qualifying rule that was introduced in 2005 to revert to the previous qualifying rule. The rule was originally established so that full-time teams, as well as their sponsors, were ensured a spot in the race when 50+ cars attempted to race. For 2013, the top 36 starting positions were set by qualifying speed. Positions 37 to 42 were set by provisionals (based off owners points). Similar to previous seasons, the forty-third position were given to the most recent series champion who didn't qualify on time or the next available team in owner's points. Unlike in previous years, the previous years' Owners points were only used for the first three races of a season instead of five. Also, NASCAR instituted a random draw to determine qualifying order instead of inverting the first practice speeds. Director of Competition Robin Pemberton stated the change was made due to teams manipulating their first practice run to get a later qualifying draw.
On January 9, 2013, the sanctioning body disclosed changes to track drying processes. At first, Brian France wanted to shorten waiting times by 80 percent, but he expects it to improve by 60 percent, stating, "We won't be at 80 percent, but we're going to be dramatically better with a whole new system on how to dry the track as much as 60 percent (faster) and we will get to the 80 percent goal." Instead of jet dryers, track crews had a vacuum following a different air-powered system. Afterward, France said, "We're patenting some technology that (uses) air pressure. Think of it as giant tanks, scuba tanks, that drive air out and blow water – or anything else – off the surface in a dramatically better way. It's a big solution. We're not (all the way) there yet, but it's ready now." However, as NASCAR is requiring tracks to pay for its rental during race weekends, very few races have actually had the system available for use. While the race at Talladega was able to be run to completion during daylight hours thanks to the new system, the race at Chicago saw a 6-hour delay due to rain and the time it took to dry the track using conventional jet dryers.
In response to the ongoing controversy over start and park teams, NASCAR decided to reallocate money from the last five finishing positions to the remainder of the field, making the practice less profitable.
NASCAR announced on April 22 that qualifying for the road course races at Sonoma Raceway and Watkins Glen International would change from the traditional single car qualifying to group qualification sessions. The rule, carried over from the Nationwide Series road races, is anticipated to speed up the qualifying process. The field that is entered for the event will be divided into qualifying groups based on times from final practice. The amount of time that each group has on track is at the discretion of the series director. The session will begin with the first car taking the green flag at the start/finish line, and a drivers fastest lap will be the one used to determine their starting position.
Controversy arose after the Federated Auto Parts 400, in which Carl Edwards beat leader Paul Menard to the start/finish line and subsequently won. On September 15, NASCAR announced that starting with the race at Chicagoland, the second place driver will be allowed to cross the line first on restarts.
Season summary.
Race reports.
Speedweeks 2013
The 2013 season began on February 16, 2013, at Daytona International Speedway with Kevin Harvick winning the 2013 Sprint Unlimited in his final season with Richard Childress Racing. Five days later, Harvick recorded another victory at Daytona International Speedway in the first qualifying race of the Daytona 500, while Kyle Busch was victorious in the second qualifying race.
Round 1: Daytona 500
Following the Duels, the points paying season began with the 55th Daytona 500. Matt Kenseth, hoping to take home his second consecutive 500 win, dominated the race but was taken out of contention by an engine failure. Jimmie Johnson, making his 400th start, held off late challenges from teammate Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Mark Martin to take his second Daytona 500 win.
Round 2: Subway Fresh Fit 500
The series then headed west to Phoenix International Raceway. There, Carl Edwards recovered from a disastrous Speedweeks by dominating the race, holding off the competition on fuel mileage to take his first win since 2011.
Round 3: Kobalt Tools 400
At Las Vegas Motor Speedway, the race was dominated by Kasey Kahne, who led 114 laps. However, new Joe Gibbs Racing driver Matt Kenseth took no tires during the final round of pit stops, handing him the lead, and managed to hold off a hard-charging Kahne to take his first win with JGR as well as becoming the third birthday winner in NASCAR history.
Round 4: Food City 500
The fourth race of the season was held at Bristol Motor Speedway and was largely dominated by Jeff Gordon and Matt Kenseth. However, on lap 390 Gordon's right front tire blew, sending him into Kenseth's path and knocking both of them out of the race. Denny Hamlin then led a fair portion of the race, seeking JGR's second consecutive win. However, after Hamlin and Joey Logano collided late, Kasey Kahne held off Kurt Busch, Kyle Busch, and Brad Keselowski to grab his first win of the season. This race marked the beginning of animosity between Hamlin and Logano
Round 5: Auto Club 400
Returning west to race at Auto Club Speedway, Kyle Busch dominated the race, leading 125 laps. However, his ex-teammate Joey Logano pulled a bump and run on Denny Hamlin with 6 laps to go, but the two wrecked each other on the final lap, allowing Busch to sneak through and capture his first win of the season. Hamlin suffered a compression fracture in his back, which kept him out of action until Talladega.
Round 6: STP Gas Booster 500
At Martinsville Speedway, the race was a battle between Jimmie Johnson and JGR teammates Kyle Busch and Matt Kenseth. Johnson eventually dominated the weekend, leading 346 laps from pole and scoring his record 8th win at Martinsville.
Round 7: NRA 500
The Cup Series then rolled into Texas Motor Speedway to return to the intermediate tracks. The night race was split between Martin Truex, Jr. and Nationwide winner Kyle Busch. The two led for a combined 313 laps, but Busch beat Truex, Jr. during the final round of pit stops on lap 315 to pull off his second weekend sweep of the season.
Round 8: STP 400
The Cup Series then headed to the repaved Kansas Speedway. 2012 Fall winner and polesitter Matt Kenseth dominated the race, leading 163 laps and holding off another furious charge from Kasey Kahne to take his second win of the season.
Round 9: Toyota Owners 400
Following Kansas, the series returned to the short tracks in the form of Richmond International Raceway. Though polesitter Matt Kenseth dominated the race, leading 140 laps, fellow Toyota drivers Clint Bowyer and Kyle Busch also took their turns up front. Kenseth faded over the race, and Busch was swept up in a near lane violation followed by a crash. After a crash on lap 325 involving Tony Stewart, Juan Pablo Montoya stayed out and led the next 67 laps. It seemed as though Montoya would get his first win on an oval track, but a crash by Brian Vickers on lap 394 set up a green-white-checker finish, sending most of the field down pit road. Jeff Burton and others stayed out during the round of pit stops, but Burton's teammate Kevin Harvick used his fresher tires to take the race lead and drive to his first win of the season.
Round 10: Aaron's 499
In the tenth race of the season at Talladega Superspeedway, Matt Kenseth again dominated the race, leading over 140 laps. On lap 42, Kyle Busch and Kasey Kahne triggered a 16-car crash. Earlier in the race, on lap 23, Denny Hamlin, making his return from the injury he suffered in the Auto Club 400, switched out with Brian Vickers. Matt Kenseth led much of the first 110 laps, though Jimmie Johnson and Ford drivers Ricky Stenhouse, Jr., polesitter Carl Edwards, Joey Logano and Brad Keselowski subsequently passed him. The Ford drivers then teamed up to pass Johnson, and before the yellow flag flew for rain, Edwards was able to pass Stenhouse. Three laps later, the red flag was flown. The rain delayed the race for 3 hours, 36 minutes. The race eventually restarted and continued to be led by Kenseth. Johnson took over after green-flag pit stops with 20 to go. The caution then came out and bunched the field up. With six laps left in the race and darkness arriving, Stenhouse and J. J. Yeley made contact, sending Yeley down the track into Kurt Busch, who flipped and landed on top of Ryan Newman's car, causing a green-white-checker finish. 14 cars in all were involved in the crash. Newman later criticized NASCAR for continuing the race even with darkness reaching the track so quickly. During the two-lap shootout, Front Row Motorsports teammates David Ragan and David Gilliland surged ahead of Kenseth, Johnson, and Edwards to finish in the top two, with Ragan securing his second career Sprint Cup victory and the first for Front Row Motorsports.
Round 11: Bojangles' Southern 500
At Darlington Raceway, Kyle Busch dominated much of the race, but a deflating tire proved to be his undoing, as teammate Matt Kenseth passed Busch with 13 laps left. Busch quickly fell to sixth, while Kenseth won his first career Sprint Cup race at Darlington with interim crew chief Wally Brown, who was filling in for Jason Ratcliff. Denny Hamlin, in his first full race since the Auto Club 400, finished second, while Jeff Gordon, racing in his 700th Sprint Cup start, finished 3rd.
Exhibition: NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race
The second exhibition race of the season took place on May 18 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. In the Sprint Showdown (the race to determine the two drivers, and another that wins a fan vote, that will advance to the All-Star Race), Martin Truex, Jr. qualified on the pole but was passed by Jamie McMurray on the first lap. McMurray led all 40 laps, win both 20-lap segments, and advanced into the All-Star Race. Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. finished second to advance as well. Danica Patrick won the fan vote to advance after a 9th place finish in the Showdown.
In the All-Star Race, Carl Edwards started on pole, but was quickly passed by Kurt Busch. Busch dominated the first 20-lap segment, which was interrupted by a caution for rain on lap seven and an ensuing red flag on lap 13 that lasted 41 minutes. Kyle Busch dominated segments two and three, before Kurt Busch once again found himself in the lead at the end of the fourth 20-lap segment. Due to a new stipulation, the field was re-ordered before the mandatory pit stop at the end of segment four. The drivers were ordered by their average finish in the first four segments. Kurt Busch, Kyle Busch, Kasey Kahne, Jimmie Johnson, and Joey Logano were the first five down pit road. Kahne's pit crew got him out first, followed by Johnson, Kyle Busch, Logano, and Kurt Busch. In the ensuing ten lap dash (segment five), Johnson and Kahne ran side-by-side for two laps before Johnson pulled away to take his second All-Star Race in a row (his record fourth win overall). He was followed by Logano, Kyle Busch, Kahne, and Kurt Busch.
Round 12: Coca Cola 600
At Charlotte Motor Speedway, the race was dominated by Kasey Kahne, Matt Kenseth and Kyle Busch. Denny Hamlin started on pole but was quickly passed for the lead by Kenseth. In a strange turn of events, the third caution caution came out on lap 122 for debris as a result of a cable that suspended a FOX Sports television camera over the frontstretch of the track snapping and falling on the track. Several cars ran over the cable, but only two sustained major damage: Kyle Busch and Marcos Ambrose. The red flag then came out on lap 126 as track officials cleaned up the cables. After a delay of 10 minutes, 40 seconds, NASCAR brought the cars down pit road and gave each team 15 minutes to look over their cars and do repairs if needed. Ten spectators received minor injuries as a result of the cable failure. Busch fell out of contention due to engine failure. Kenseth was hit from behind by Juan Pablo Montoya when he tried slow up due to a spin out by Jimmie Johnson. Kahne appeared to be headed towards back-to-back 600 victories, but a caution on lap 385 forced Kahne to stay out on old tires. 2011 Coke 600 winner Kevin Harvick, who took two tires, drove past Kahne on the restart to claim his second win of the season.
Round 13: FedEx 400
At Dover International Speedway, car owner Joe Gibbs had his 3 cars starting in 3 of the top 4 spots. Denny Hamlin won the pole, Kyle Busch and Matt Kenseth started third through fourth. Martin Truex, Jr. started 2nd. Kyle Busch later took the lead and nearly put points leader Jimmie Johnson one lap down until green-flag pit stops allowed Johnson to stay on the lead lap. During a caution, Matt Kenseth beat Busch off pit road to take the lead. Kenseth led the next 29 laps when his engine failed, giving Busch the lead again. Kenseth finished 40th. Busch led the most with 150. Johnson came on strong in the second half of the race, leading 143 laps. Just under 100 laps after Kenseth's engine blew, Truex, Jr.'s engine also blew. After pit stops due to a late caution, Juan Pablo Montoya was in the lead with Johnson in second. Stewart took only two tires on the final pit stop for track position. At the restart with 19 laps remaining, Johnson jumped the gun and was penalized. Johnson protested over the radio that he didn't deserve the penalty and stayed on the track asking for a review. Johnson finally followed the order to head to the pits and serve a pass-through penalty. Johnson finished 17th. Stewart, aided by Johnson's miscalculation, Kasey Kahne's Turn 1 mistake and a fading Kyle Busch, caught a loose Montoya, passing him with three laps left. Stewart remained in the lead, winning his first race of the season.
Round 14: Party in the Poconos 400
Jimmie Johnson was rewarded the pole after qualifying was rained out. After Carl Edwards led the first nine laps, Johnson took the lead and dominated the race, leading 128 of 160 laps, to win his third race of the season. Greg Biffle, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Tony Stewart, and Ryan Newman rounded out the top-five.
Round 15: Quicken Loans 400
The race began with Menard colliding with pole-sitter Edwards in an attempt to grab the lead in the first turn. While Edwards lost multiple positions, Menard wasn't able to capture the lead either and Kurt Busch came out on top. Shortly after, the caution flag flew after Bobby Labonte got loose and spun into Gordon. After a lap 20 competition caution for the previous night's rain, Kurt Busch got loose off of turn two and crashed down the back-straightaway.
Afterward, multiple caution flags and different pit stop strategies gave Joey Logano, Jamie McMurray, Jimmie Johnson, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., and Kasey Kahne turns at leading the race. Johnson rebounded to the second position after falling to twelfth as a result of a restart mistake, and leader Kahne blew a right-front tire and hit the wall in turn one on lap 105. Johnson took over the lead but lost it to Earnhardt during pit stops. On the restart, Earnhardt pulled away from Matt Kenseth and Greg Biffle as Johnson struggled to battle back to the lead. Several laps later, Earnhardt developed engine problems and started to fall back, giving Johnson the lead (after he had passed Kenseth and Biffle). After a few slow laps, Earnhardt's engine blew up, bringing out yet another caution. After taking four tires in the pits, Johnson fell to 20th and Edwards took the lead ahead of Logano, Kenseth, and Biffle. Biffle then closed in on Edwards and passed him for the lead on lap 150, quickly pulling away. A caution for McMurray's blown right-front tire came in the middle of the last round of pit stops, trapping Edwards a lap down (he got the free pass). Biffle, who had pitted under the green but did not go a lap down, cycled out as the leader. On the restart at lap 174, Kenseth got loose off of turn two and dropped several positions while Johnson, who restarted 10th, tried to pick up positions. Johnson gradually came through the field, passing Kevin Harvick to move into second with eight laps to go. However, as Johnson struggled to catch Biffle, he blew a right-front tire out of turn two on lap 198. Biffle sped away to win over Harvick, Martin Truex, Jr., Kyle Busch, and Tony Stewart. Biffle's victory was the 1,000th for the Ford Motor Company in NASCAR's top 3 series.
Round 16: Toyota/Save Mart 350
Jamie McMurray started on the pole, but Kurt Busch was able to get the lead early. However, Busch suffered back-to-back speeding penalties, sending him to the back of the field. Danica Patrick became the first woman to race a road course in the Sprint Cup Series; she spun mid-way through the race in turn seven and finished 29th. Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch both struggled, going off track numerous times. Martin Truex Jr. led 51 laps on his way to his first win in 218 races, setting a NASCAR record for most races between wins. Juan Pablo Montoya was running second on the white flag lap before running out of gas, relegating him to a 34th place finish. Truex was followed by Jeff Gordon and Carl Edwards, with Kurt Busch and defending race winner Clint Bowyer rounding out the top five.
Round 17: Quaker State 400
Dale Earnhardt, Jr. started on pole, but Carl Edwards led the first 30 laps. After a lap 30 competition caution and a second caution on lap 43 for a Kyle Busch spin, Earnhardt assumed the lead until Jimmie Johnson passed him on the lap 46 restart. Johnson went on to dominate the race, leading 182 of the 267 laps. Two laps after the restart, Kurt Busch spun Brad Keselowski going into turn one, causing Keselowski to slide back up the track, where he collected Greg Biffle, Dave Blaney, and Travis Kvapil. The crash caused a red flag so the track could be cleaned.
Once back to green on lap 52, Johnson held the lead over second-place Matt Kenseth until a restart on lap 94, when Kenseth moved into the lead and Kyle Busch passed Johnson for second. Kenseth led until the next caution (a debris caution on lap 109), when he came to pit road after running over the debris. Johnson, who stayed out, reassumed the lead and held it until lap 149, when he was beat off of pit road by Edwards following a caution for a Denny Hamlin tire failure. Hamlin hit the wall where there was no SAFER barrier and had a lengthy stay in the infield care center; however, he was not injured.
Johnson retook the lead shortly after the lap 154 restart and held the lead until lap 244 when he was beaten off of pit road by Kenseth, who didn't take any tires following a caution for Brian Vickers' collision with the wall. On the restart, Kenseth restarted on the outside and pulled away as Johnson spun his tires. Joey Logano tried to make it three-wide in turn one. This partly resulted in Johnson's car losing control and spinning onto the track apron. Johnson made a pit stop and restarted 25th on lap 251. However, Kenseth continued to lead, and he picked up his fourth win of 2013, ahead of Jamie McMurray, Clint Bowyer, Logano, and Kurt Busch. Johnson battled back to finish ninth after his spin.
Round 18: Coke Zero 400
Kyle Busch started on pole and led 30 of the first 33 laps. Jimmie Johnson then took the lead and dominated, leading 94 of 161 laps (a green-white-checker lengthened the race by one lap). Jamie McMurray led 10 laps just past the halfway point after Johnson restarted in the middle of the pack, but no one was actually able to take the lead from Johnson. A series of crashes occurred in the second half of the race, two of which involved four cars each and another which had six cars involved. The drivers in these crashes were: Martin Truex, Jr., Juan Pablo Montoya, Kyle Busch, Aric Almirola, Greg Biffle, Jeff Gordon, Matt Kenseth, David Reutimann, Dave Blaney, David Stremme, Denny Hamlin, and A. J. Allmendinger. Hamlin and Allmendinger were both involved in two of the crashes, including the third (and largest) crash in which Hamlin lost control and hit the wall, and was then hit hard by Allmendinger.
A caution waved with four to go after Kasey Kahne and Marcos Ambrose (who were second and third at the time) tangled and Kahne hit the inside wall. This set up a green-white-checker finish attempt in which Johnson and Tony Stewart were able to get in front of Kevin Harvick and Clint Bowyer. Two large crashes occurred on the last lap; the first saw Carl Edwards got turned in turn one, collecting Ambrose, Bobby Labonte, Scott Speed, and others. In the tri-oval, Danica Patrick cut down in front of David Gilliland and was turned into Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. and Ryan Newman, causing a crash that also involved Kyle Busch, Casey Mears, and Jeff Burton, among others.
Johnson held off Stewart, Harvick, and Bowyer to win his fourth race of the season. Michael Waltrip rounded out the top five. Johnson became the first driver since Bobby Allison in 1982 to win both Daytona races in the same year.
Round 19: Camping World RV Sales 301
The second half of the season started with Brad Keselowski clinching the pole. Jimmie Johnson (who qualified second) was sent to the rear of the field for failing post-qualifying inspection. Keselowski led the first few laps, but relinquished the lead to Kyle Busch, who, in turn, lost it to Kurt Busch. As drivers came into and fell out of the top ten due to pit strategy, both Kurt and Kyle Busch, Matt Kenseth, Tony Stewart, and others took turns at the front.
Stewart led the majority of the last 100 laps, but Brian Vickers passed both Stewart and Kyle Busch with about 15 laps left. The race saw an unusually high amount of cautions, with the 12th of the day coming out with four to go to set up a green-white-checker finish. On the restart, Vickers held the lead over Stewart and Busch, but coming to the white flag, Stewart ran out of fuel. This allowed Vickers to take his third career win over Kyle Busch, Jeff Burton, Keselowski, and Aric Almirola.
Round 20: Crown Royal Presents The Samuel Deeds 400 at The Brickyard
Ryan Newman started on pole after setting a new track-record in the process. Newman led the first 29 laps, but Jimmie Johnson took over after a round of green-flag pit stops. Johnson led 74 laps, more than anyone else, swapping the lead several times with Newman and other drivers due to pit strategy. Three caution periods slowed the race, two for Timmy Hill's car slowing due to fuel pump problems an the other for Jeff Burton's slowing car. After a slow last green flag pit stop, Johnson fell 10 seconds behind Newman, who took only two tires during his last green flag pit stop. With 16 laps remaining the 1–2 leaders of Denny Hamlin and Kevin Harvick had to pit, giving the lead back to Newman who was now 7 seconds ahead of Johnson. Newman led the last 16 laps to win his first race since the 2012 Goody's Fast Relief 500. Johnson finished second, followed by Kasey Kahne, Tony Stewart, and Matt Kenseth.
Round 21: Gobowling.com 400
Jimmie Johnson started on pole and led 43 laps early, with Kyle Busch, Kurt Busch, and others exchanging spots in the top five. The first caution was displayed in turn one on lap one after Juan Pablo Montoya got loose and slid up the track, collecting, most notably, Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. and Matt Kenseth. Denny Hamlin's day was ended early, after he hit the wall on lap 14 and went out of the race, finishing in the 43rd position. Just before halfway, Johnson blew a tire and hit the wall, bringing out the caution. He spent much of the remaining race around 25th, and rallied in the late stages to finish 13th. Kasey Kahne dominated the race after that, and swapped the lead with Jeff Gordon twice on the last two restarts to take his second win of the year. Gordon, Kurt Busch, Ryan Newman, and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. rounded out the top five.
Round 22: Cheez-It 355 at The Glen
Marcos Ambrose won the pole position and led 51 of the first 62 laps. After a caution during green flag pit stops shuffled the field, Ambrose and others frontrunners were cycled outside the top 12 and Kyle Busch took over as the leader. Busch led the majority of the rest of the race and hold off Brad Keselowski and Martin Truex, Jr. to win his second career race at Watkins Glen and his third of the season. Many contenders were caught up in numerous crashes during the race, including Kasey Kahne, Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Ambrose, Matt Kenseth, Brian Vickers, Ron Fellows, Jeff Burton, Paul Menard, David Ragan, Landon Cassill, Tomy Drissi, and others. One crash involving five cars brought out a several-minute red flag to clean up oil dropped on the track.
Round 23: Pure Michigan 400
Joey Logano took the pole position with a new track record and traded the lead with Kurt Busch early as three cautions waved in the first 15 laps. After crashing his primary car in practice, points-leader Jimmie Johnson started 41st and quickly came to the front to lead three laps during a round of pit stops. However, while running in 7th on lap 53, Johnson's engine failed and he was relegated to a 40th place finish. Meanwhile, several different drivers took turns at the front, with Kurt Busch leading 43 laps, Greg Biffle leading 28, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. taking over for 20 circuits, and Brad Keselowski leading 17 laps. Earnhardt blew a right-front tire while in 6th place midway through the race and spent several laps in the garage under repairs. Late in the race, Mark Martin stayed out to try to win the race on fuel mileage. He led 23 laps before running out of gas with four to go, dropping him to 27th. This allowed pole-sitter Logano, who led a race-high 51 laps, to take his and Penske Racing's first win of the year.
Round 24: Irwin Tools Night Race
Denny Hamlin took the pole and led the first 22 laps. After being passed by Kurt Busch, Hamlin fell back to mid-field. Busch led most of the laps until lap 81, when he came down pit road for a loose wheel and was given a pass-thru penalty for speeding. Carl Edwards and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. shared the lead during the next two stints, before Clint Bowyer passed Earnhardt for the lead on lap 126. Bowyer led until getting spun on lap 176, causing the fourth caution. Edwards retook the lead, showing the way until being passed by Matt Kenseth on lap 236. After a lap 259 debris caution, Kenseth was caught speeding on pit road and relegated to the back, while Paul Menard stayed out to take the lead. Edwards once again claimed the lead on lap 322.
Kevin Harvick took the lead after the seventh caution on lap 335, but he was quickly passed by Edwards on lap 344. Edwards held the lead through two more cautions, but dropped a cylinder on lap 380 and blew his engine on lap 389. Kenseth held the lead through most of the final 120 laps and held off a final 10-lap charge by Kasey Kahne to score his fifth victory of the season. Juan Pablo Montoya finished third, and Brian Vickers and Joey Logano rounded out the top five. Eleven caution flags waved during the race, three of which were for debris. Drivers involved in seven, mostly minor, crashes included Ryan Truex, Josh Wise, Clint Bowyer, Tony Raines, Jimmie Johnson, David Reutimann, Aric Almirola, and Jeff Burton. The eleventh caution on lap 448, as Hamlin blew a tire and ran into Ryan Newman, causing a large crash also involving Brad Keselowski, Martin Truex, Jr., Terry Labonte, and Kevin Harvick. Truex, Jr. suffered a broken wrist after the accident.
Round 25: AdvoCare 500
Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. won his first pole, but quickly fell back at the start. Juan Pablo Montoya led the first 25 laps, before dropping the position to Joey Logano one lap before a scheduled competition caution. On the restart, Jeff Gordon was bumped by Matt Kenseth, causing an accordion effect that involved Kasey Kahne, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Jimmie Johnson, Jeff Burton, and Mark Martin. Some cars suffered major damage. Carl Edwards took the lead from Montoya on the restart and led until pit stops under the third caution at lap 60. Gordon took over here, holding the lead until pit stops on lap 78 (the caution having been for Paul Menard's wheel coming off and being hit by Johnson). Edwards reclaimed the lead and held it until green-flag pit stops on lap 123. Logano (who was off-sequence) took over until Clint Bowyer went by on lap 139. He pitted on lap 166, and reclaimed the position from Logano on lap 173, before blowing his engine on lap 192.
Edwards took the lead on pit road, but lost it to Logano on the restart, just before a crash involving Paul Menard and Denny Hamlin. Brad Keselowski passed Logano on lap 214 (just after the restart) and stayed in front until his engine dropped a cylinder on lap 244. After another cycle of green-flag pit stops, Logano held the lead until Jimmie Johnson spun on lap 286. Kyle Busch won the race off pit road and held the lead through two more cautions to pick up his fourth win of the season. Logano, Martin Truex, Jr., Kurt Busch, and Ryan Newman rounded out the top five.
Round 26: Federated Auto Parts 400
The final race of the regular season was held at Richmond International Raceway. Jeff Gordon led the initial run, with Chase contenders Brad Keselowski and Kurt Busch following behind. Chase hopeful Jamie McMurray joined the battle for the lead during the early stages. When Gordon dropped back significantly, Keselowski and Busch swapped the lead in traffic. Keselowski ended up leading 142 laps on the night, but ended up 17th. Through the final 100 laps, Carl Edwards surged into the top 10 and took the lead from Busch after a round of pit stops on lap 349. Wild Card contender Ryan Newman took the lead from Edwards with 10 laps to go, needing a win to break a tie with Martin Truex, Jr. A spin by Clint Bowyer with 8 laps to go forced the field onto pit road. Paul Menard and others gambled on two tires in a repeat of the April race. On the final restart, Edwards beat Menard to the line and held off Busch and Newman for his second win.
The Wild Card race ome down to the wire. The final spots came down to Joey Logano, Keselowski, Gordon, Truex, Jr. and Newman. On the final round of stops, Logano took the wave-around, finishing 22nd and beating Gordon for 10th place in the Chase by a single point. Despite finishing 3rd, Newman was bounced out of the second Wild Card spot by Truex based on a tiebreak owing to the latter's 2nd place finish at Texas.
The spin by Bowyer led to controversy as to whether or not Bowyer spun himself out intentionally to allow Truex to win the tiebreaker with Newman. While Bowyer claimed that the spin was unintentional, audio from Brian Vickers' car was uncovered, revealing that Ty Norris had Vickers unnecessarily pit on the final restart in order to help Truex into the Chase. As it turned out, this forced Newman to the back of the cycle on pit stops, ensuring he would not finish high enough to break the tie with Truex. On September 9, 2013, NASCAR docked 50 owner/driver points from all three MWR teams. As the penalty was applied before points were reset for the Chase, this had the effect of ejecting Truex from the Chase and putting Newman in his place. Bowyer's totals were not affected, as he was locked into the Chase at Bristol. While NASCAR determined Bowyer's spin was not intentional, it found that MWR had manipulated the Chase standings by having Vickers pit improperly. Norris was also suspended indefinitely.
At the same time, evidence surfaced that Logano may have gotten a spot in the Chase due to illicit help from Front Row Motorsports, which is considered a partner with Logano's team at Penske Racing; both are Ford teams. Front Row's spotter was heard asking David Gilliland to let Logano pass him on the restart following the caution triggered by Bowyer's spin. Logano finished 22nd, enough to give him the final Chase spot. Four days after the race, NASCAR placed Penske and Front Row on probation for the remainder of the season. At the same time, Chairman Brian France announced that Gordon was added to the Chase as part of an "unprecedented" step of expanding the Chase to 13 cars. According to France, NASCAR had determined that Gordon would have qualified for the Chase if not for the "unfair disadvantage" he had suffered from the actions of MWR and Penske/Front Row.
Round 27: GEICO 400
After a rain delay of over one hour, Joey Logano started on pole and led the first 32 laps. Jimmie Johnson took the lead on lap 32 pit stops by taking only two tires after a lap 30 competition caution. Johnson led 40 laps, then came to pit road for green-flag pit stops. Johnson would have a slow pit stop, relegating him to fifth place. This gave the lead to Matt Kenseth, who led the race until a caution waved on lap 108 for rain and a spin by Cole Whitt. The rain caused a lengthy delay of just over five hours and ten minutes while the track was dried.
The race resumed at night, and Kenseth held the lead until pit stops on lap 150. During the time Kenseth was out front, Juan Pablo Montoya blew a tire (causing the third caution) and Justin Allgaier spun in his first career Sprint Cup start (bringing out the fourth caution). Joey Logano's engine lost two cylinders as well. Jeff Gordon took the lead after the lap 150 pit stops and remained out front through the fifth caution until the next cycle of pit stops during the sixth caution on lap 170. Meanwhile, Cole Whitt's car exploded in a ball of fire, and Brian Vickers' engine blew up. Greg Biffle won the race off pit road, but was passed by Kyle Busch on the lap 173 restart. Jeff Gordon pitted with a flat left-rear tire one lap later. On lap 177, Joey Logano's engine blew up, bringing out the seventh caution. Kyle Busch continued to lead, now in front of Martin Truex, Jr. and Matt Kenseth, as Jimmie Johnson (who restarted 20th on lap 182) raced his way to the top three by lap 210.
Dale Earnhardt, Jr. brought out the eighth caution on lap 226 by blowing his engine during a cycle of green-flag pit stops. Kyle Busch, Kenseth, and Johnson restarted as the top three, and Busch and Kenseth remained the top two until the end of the race. Justin Allgaier once again spun on lap 239, and Kenseth passed Busch on the restart. He held off Busch to win his sixth race of the year. Kevin Harvick finished third, Kurt Busch fourth, and Jimmie Johnson fifth.
Round 28: Sylvania 300
Ryan Newman took the pole with a new track record and led the first two laps, after which he fell back quickly. Kasey Kahne took over and led until the lap 36 restart, having retained the lead through pit stops during the first caution as a result of a spin by Josh Wise. The second caution immediately waved on lap 37 for a crash involving Jamie McMurray and Kevin Swindell. Martin Truex, Jr., who took the lead from Kahne, continued to lead on the restart and led until green-flag pit stops on lap 110. Meanwhile, Bobby Labonte blew a tire on lap 53, causing the third caution. Matt Kenseth and Brad Keselowski led during the pit cycle before handing the lead to Dale Earnhardt, Jr., who was off-sequence with the others and led until lap 130. Truex took over again and stayed up front until Kenseth went by on lap 153.
The fourth caution flew for a crash on lap 165, and Jeff Gordon became the leader after pit stops. Debris caused the fifth caution on lap 201, and Jimmie Johnson came off pit road first; however, Clint Bowyer and Marcos Ambrose did not pit. By lap 210, Matt Kenseth had passed everyone to take the lead once more. David Gilliland blew his engine on lap 245, and Kenseth held the lead after the lap 250 restart as well as the lap 257 restart (following a spin by Kasey Kahne to bring out the seventh caution). Kenseth held the lead over Kyle Busch, Greg Biffle, and Jimmie Johnson over the last 40 laps to win his second consecutive race, and his seventh of the year.
Round 29: AAA 400
Dale Earnhardt, Jr. won his second pole of the year and led the first 25 laps. Matt Kenseth, who started second, took over on lap 26 as a result of Earnhardt getting hung up in lap traffic. Earnhardt then retook the lead five laps later after more problems with lap traffic. The first caution waved on lap 37 for debris, and Kyle Busch came off pit road first. Busch led until Ryan Newman passed him lap 72. Earnhardt then went by Newman on lap 76 and led until missing pit road on lap 117 during green-flag pit stops. Earnhardt came out in eighth, giving the lead to Jimmie Johnson. Johnson led until pit stops under the second caution, which came out on lap 165 for debris. Matt Kenseth retook the lead from Johnson and held it until Johnson went back by on lap 198. The third caution, for fluid from Brad Keselowski's car, came out on lap 227, but Johnson held the lead off pit road. Johnson and Earnhardt pulled away on the restart as Kenseth lost a position to Kyle Busch.
By lap 298, Earnhardt had caught Johnson, but struggled to get by, finally taking the lead as Johnson made a pit stop on lap 310. After the round of stops cycled through, Johnson retained the lead, with Kenseth, Gordon, and Earnhardt (who got stuck behind a slower car) following behind. The fourth caution flag waved on lap 370 for debris in turn three, and Johnson, Gordon, and Kenseth took two tires. Earnhardt came out fourth with four fresh tires, but could only get to second on the restart. Johnson held him off to take his fifth victory of the season and his record eighth win at Dover, surpassing Richard Petty and Bobby Allison with seven wins apiece. Joey Logano finished third, followed by Jeff Gordon and Kyle Busch.
Round 30: Hollywood Casino 400
Kevin Harvick won his first pole since 2006 in a race plagued with 15 cautions for debris, crashes, and spins involving several drivers, including Kyle Busch, Ryan Newman, and Danica Patrick. While points leader Matt Kenseth struggled with a loose racecar to finish eleventh, Harvick dominated the race, leading 138 laps en route to his third win of the season. Jimmie Johnson developed an engine problem with two laps to go and limped home to finish sixth.
Round 31: Bank of America 500
Jeff Gordon started on pole and led the first 26 laps, losing the lead during pit stops to Kasey Kahne after Dave Blaney hit the wall to cause the first caution. All four Hendrick Motorsports cars dominated the race, leading all but 21 laps. Kahne led early, leading 138 laps in total, and Jimmie Johnson led 130 circuits himself. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. led 19 laps after passing Kahne on a couple of restarts, and Jeff Gordon led the first 26 laps after starting first. Most of the laps led by other drivers, such as Kyle Busch, Matt Kenseth, Ryan Newman, Carl Edwards, Clint Bowyer, and David Gilliland, occurred during green-flag pit stops and totaled no more than Busch's total of four laps.
After the first caution at lap 25, three more caution flags waved during the race: first for Mark Martin's blown engine on lap 84, second for debris on lap 173, and last, once again for debris, on lap 308. Jimmie Johnson had taken the lead from Kahne on the lap 178 restart after the third caution and held the top point until pit stops during the last caution on lap 309, minus a few laps during a round of green-flag pit stops. Kasey Kahne and Jeff Gordon took two tires and beat Kenseth and Johnson, who took four tires, off of pit road. On the restart, Johnson got loose in turn two and dropped to seventh as Kahne tried to pull away from Kenseth and Brad Keselowski, who had quickly passed Gordon on the restart. Keselowski got by Kenseth and ran down and passed Kahne after a fierce battle with less than ten laps to go. Keselowski led the final eight laps (to total eleven led in the race) to win his first race of the year and become the first non-Chase driver to win in the Chase since, ironically, Kahne in the 2011 Kobalt Tools 500. Kahne barely held on to second, Kenseth finished third, and Johnson recovered to finish fourth. Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick, and Jeff Gordon rounded out the top seven.
Round 32: Camping World RV Sales 500
Qualifying was cancelled due to rain, causing the starting positions to be set by the fastest times during the first practice. Thus, Aric Almirola started from the pole. The first caution quickly waved on lap three as Tony Raines' engine expired. After the restart, numerous drivers took turns leading as Kasey Kahne lost the draft just after lap 20 and quickly fell behind. Matt Kenseth, who first took the lead on lap 12 and led six laps, retook the lead on lap 27 and led the field until pitting on lap 42. On lap 43, Kyle Busch was blocked on pit road by Jamie McMurray during green-flag pit stops and missed his pit stall, causing him to have to come down pit road again. Meanwhile, Brad Keselowski and Bobby Labonte received pass-through penalties for speeding on pit road. After pit stops, Kenseth, Jimmie Johnson, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. traded the lead several times until the caution came out on lap 80 for a crash involving Marcos Ambrose and Juan Pablo Montoya. Montoya's car would be retired from the race. Johnson, Earnhardt, and Kenseth continued to do most of the leading until Kenseth's car fell back because of handling problems. Clint Bowyer and Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. also took turns up front.
Kasey Kahne was caught speeding on pit road during the next round of green-flag pit stops and was given a penalty. Earnhardt cycled out into the lead and Johnson dropped to 17th. However, five laps later (lap 132), Johnson retook the lead. Earnhardt and Kyle Busch shared the lead with Johnson, as Kenseth once again dropped due to handling. After another round of green-flag pit stops just after lap 160, many drivers took turns leading until Jamie McMurray took over on lap 175. Earnhardt moved into second as the field quickly went from three-wide to single file in the top lane, causing drivers such as Johnson, Kenseth, and Jeff Gordon to fall to the back. On the last lap, the field remained single-file and off of turn two, third place Austin Dillon got sideways and was then turned around backwards by fourth place Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. Dillon backed around into the wall directly in the path of Casey Mears, whose hit to Dillon caused him to go airborne and almost flip. Meanwhile, the caution waved and Jamie McMurray scored his seventh career win, his first since the 2010 Bank of America 500. Earnhardt finished second, followed by Stenhouse, Paul Menard, Kyle Busch, David Ragan, and David Gilliland. Johnson finished 13th and Kenseth came home 20th, allowing Johnson to take the points lead.
Round 33: Goody's Headache Relief Shot 500
Denny Hamlin took the pole with a new track record, but was quickly passed by Jimmie Johnson on lap three. The caution first waved on lap eight as Carl Edwards spun Jeff Burton, causing minor damage to both. Ricky Stenhouse, Jr., Kasey Kahne, Mark Martin, and Travis Kvapil received minor damage as well. The restart came on lap 20, and Kyle Busch passed for the lead on lap 26. Matt Kenseth then took the lead on lap 38. The second caution came out on lap 89 as Carl Edwards this time spun Travis Kvapil. Kenseth held the lead off of pit road and on the lap 95 restart, before being passed by Johnson on lap 111. The third caution was thrown for Bobby Labonte spinning David Reutimann in turn three on lap 141. Johnson held the lead after pit stops and on the restart on lap 147. On lap 167, Kyle Larson's engine blew to bring out the fourth caution. Jeff Burton stayed out but was quickly passed by Johnson after the lap 181 restart. Two laps later, as Burton and Earnhardt checked up near the front, a large stack of caused numerous cars to get damage, including polesitter Denny Hamlin, Kasey Kahne, Martin Truex, Jr., Ken Schrader, and Aric Almirola. Kahne would get stuck in the turn one grass and would have to be towed back onto the track. Johnson continued to lead on the restart, but the sixth caution flew on lap 205 as Jamie McMurray and Kurt Busch got together. Busch spun and then collected Mark Martin. The race restarted on lap 210, and Kenseth retook the lead on lap 217, two laps before Travis Kvapil spun to bring out the seventh caution.
Kenseth held the lead on the restart as Johnson started to fall back. The eighth caution came out on lap 230 for another spin by David Reutimann and Johnson led Kyle Busch and Dale Earnhardt, Jr., among others, down pit road as Kenseth and many others stayed out. Kenseth led on the lap 235 restart but was passed by Clint Bowyer on lap 239 and quickly fell back, falling all the way to 17th by the ninth caution on lap 285. Meanwhile, Johnson recovered to third by the caution as Jeff Gordon took the lead from Bowyer a lap earlier (lap 283). The caution came out for Reed Sorenson's stalled car on the track. Gordon and Johnson were the first two off of pit road and they held those positions on the lap 291 restart. On lap 298, the tenth caution fell over the track for debris off of Earnhardt's car. Landon Cassill was spun by Kasey Kahne on lap 309 to bring out the eleventh caution. Johnson fell to fourth on the lap 315 restart, and Kevin Harvick and Ryan Newman got together on lap 319 in turn one, causing Newman to spin and bring out the twelfth caution. On lap 328, Juan Pablo Montoya made it three-wide with Marcos Ambrose and Truex, causing Truex to get spun and cause the 13th caution. Jimmie Johnson pitted from sixth and fell to 20th for the lap 333 restart. Debris on the frontstretch caused the 14th caution on lap 338, and Gordon and Kyle Busch made pit stops, giving the lead to Denny Hamlin. Clint Bowyer then took the lead from Hamlin on lap 351 and led until Cole Whitt spun and hit the wall in turn three on lap 366 to cause to 15th caution. Hamlin was the first off of pit road, but Elliott Sadler stayed out to take the lead. Matt Kenseth took the lead on lap 374 and J.J. Yeley spun on lap 380 to bring out the 16th caution. Kenseth continued to lead through the 17th caution on lap 416 for debris in turn one and the following pit stops and held the lead on the lap 424 restart. Kenseth was passed for the lead by Jeff Gordon on lap 479 and Gordon scored his first win of the season ahead of Kenseth, Clint Bowyer, Brad Keselowski, and Jimmie Johnson. The win awarded the 2013 Manufacturer Championship to Chevrolet and the finishes by Kenseth and Johnson caused a tie in the championship points, with the tiebreaker going to Kenseth with more race victories.
Round 34: AAA Texas 500
Carl Edwards took the pole and led 38 laps in the early going, but engine trouble relegated him to a 37th place finish. Jimmie Johnson took over and dominated, leading 255 laps on the day, being interrupted only by Brad Keselowski, who led 30 laps as a result to pit strategy. Johnson won his sixth race of the season as Matt Kenseth, who had a pit road speeding penalty, battled an ill-handling racecar to finish fourth.
Round 35: AdvoCare 500
Jimmie Johnson started the race with his fourth pole of the year, but in a lap one turn one scramble with Denny Hamlin and Joey Logano, he was bumped to the outside and fell back to sixth. Hamlin would then lead the first 18 laps, but relinquished the top spot to Jeff Gordon. Hamlin then fell all the way back to 23rd with a loose car before spinning out in turn two on lap 50 to bring out the first caution. Johnson had recovered to third by the caution, and followed Gordon and Kevin Harvick off of pit road. Harvick then took the lead from Gordon on the lap 56 restart. Lap 101 saw the second caution, and Kasey Kahne took two tires on pit road to take the lead, while Johnson fell to fifth, Gordon sixth, and Harvick seventh. Timmy Hill crashed in turn one to bring out the third caution on lap 117, and many drivers outside the top ten, including Clint Bowyer and Matt Kenseth, came in to pit. Brad Keselowski then took the lead from Kahne on the ensuing restart. The fourth caution came out on lap 132, as Travis Kvapil's engine blew up in front of Dave Blaney, causing Blaney to take evasive action and spin. Several drivers outside the top ten pitted, bumping Matt Kenseth up to 15th. However, as Keselowski continued to lead on the restart, Kenseth (battling an extremely tight racecar) dropped to 23rd before the field was slowed for the fifth time because of a crash involving Danica Patrick, Justin Allgaier, David Reutimann, and Cole Whitt. Many of the leaders pitted, but Jeff Gordon stayed out to take the lead, with Jamie McMurray and Ryan Newman just behind.
After heavy battling on the restart, Johnson and Carl Edwards got together in turn one on lap 163, causing them to fall to 26th and 27th, respectively, as J. J. Yeley spun behind them. Ryan Newman took the lead by not pitting, as Matt Kenseth had a 25-second stop to fall from seventh to 29th. Johnson restarted 25th and worked his way back into the top 15, as Newman continued to lead over Joey Logano. Lap 191 saw a hard crash for David Reutimann in turn one to cause to seventh caution, and all of the frontrunners came down pit road, leaving Joey Logano and Kasey Kahne out front. As Logano led after the restart, Johnson came from fifth to third, and Kenseth dropped from 12th place to 20th as his car continued to have handling problems. By lap 224, Kahne had ran down and taken the lead from Logano, and Kenseth had further fallen to 25th. Kahne pitted on lap 247, allowing Johnson to lead his first lap of the race. Johnson pitted on lap later, giving the lead to Edwards, who then gave the lead to Kevin Harvick on lap 250. Harvick, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Kyle Busch, Clint Bowyer, and others stayed out several laps longer. Harvick ran out of fuel on lap 268, giving the lead to Earnhardt, who pitted on lap 271. Ryan Newman took the lead for four laps, then gave the top spot to Greg Biffle for a lap, before Carl Edwards cycled into a four-second lead over Kahne. The eighth caution waved on lap 282 for debris from Danica Patrick's car, and eleven lead lap cars stayed out, including Edwards, Kahne, Johnson, and Harvick. Edwards continued leading on the lap 289 restart over Kahne, but Harvick passed Johnson to move into third. Harvick passed Kahne on lap 295 and began trying to run down Edwards. However, Harvick could not close and Edwards appeared to be on his way to sweeping the 2013 Phoenix races. But with a lap and a half to go, Edwards ran out of fuel and Harvick took home the victory in his penultimate race with Richard Childress Racing. Kahne came in second and Johnson finished third, having led only one lap despite starting on pole. Edwards finished 21st, and Kenseth limped home in 23rd, losing 21 points to Johnson in the Championship standings to fall to 28 points behind.
Round 36: Ford EcoBoost 400
Matt Kenseth won his third pole of the year, with third-place in points Kevin Harvick starting sixth and points-leader Jimmie Johnson starting seventh. Kenseth had the dominate car for most of the race, leading a race high 144 laps. Later, after a restart with 74 laps remaining, Kenseth restarted in sixth and Johnson lines up behind him in eighth. Jeff Gordon restarted in fourth and spun his tires, causing an accordion effect that involved Johnson, Kenseth, Mark Martin, and others. Most of the damage was minimal, and Kenseth made his way up to finish second behind his teammate Denny Hamlin, who won his first race of the year. Harvick led eight laps to finished tenth and claim third in the points. Johnson, although he led no laps, finished in ninth place to win his sixth career championship by 19 points over Kenseth.

Les Misérables (1917 film)

Les Misérables is one of many filmed versions of the Victor Hugo novel of the same name. It was a silent film directed by Frank Lloyd, co-written by Lloyd and Marc Robbins, and produced by William Fox, released in the United States on December 3, 1917. It starred William Farnum, Hardee Kirkland, and George Moss.
Background and production.
Even by the time this film was created in 1917, there had already been "at least a dozen" film adaptations of this Victor Hugo novel. Only a portion of the novel was included in the screenplay, but it included some of "the most famous" events, such as the story of the Bishop who gave Valjean his silver candlesticks in order to start a new life, and the street rebellion that was part of the French revolution.
William Farnum was "Fox's biggest male box-office attraction" when the movie was made, and had previously appeared in Lloyd's film adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel, "A Tale of Two Cities".
Plot.
Jean Valjean is a French peasant who spends almost twenty years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family, and then—when his "yellow passport" (given to him because of his status as a convicted criminal) makes it almost impossible to build a new life—he steals silverware from a kind Catholic Bishop who had given him a meal and a place to sleep. When the police find him with the silver they return him to the Bishop to confirm the theft, but the Bishop surprises Valjean by telling the police the silver had been a gift, and then adding his silver candlesticks, saying Valjean must have mistakenly left them behind because they were part of the gift. Valjean uses the money to start a new life under a new name, eventually becoming mayor of a small town, but police inspector Javert suspects Valjean, and works relentlessly to reveal his true identity and his past crimes.

Truman B. Ransom

Truman B. Ransom (September 20, 1802—September 13, 1847) was a Vermont educator and military officer who served as President of Norwich University and commander of a regiment in the Mexican–American War. He was killed at the Battle of Chapultepec.
Early life.
Truman Bishop Ransom was born in Woodstock, Vermont on September 20, 1802. At age 13 he was apprenticed as a chair-maker and painter. At age 16 he began attendance at the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy, now called Norwich University, alternating semesters with work for his employer in Quechee, Vermont to pay his tuition.
Career.
Ransom graduated in 1825 and began a career as an educator, teaching at several colleges started or overseen by Norwich University founder Alden Partridge, or that operated on his Norwich University model, including Jefferson College in Mississippi. In 1835 Ransom became Vice President of Norwich University and was also appointed Professor of natural philosophy and engineering.
Ransom volunteered for the militia in the 1830s, and advanced through the ranks from Captain to Major General, gaining experience as a drill master and commander of units from company to brigade. In 1836 he received his Master of Arts degree from Norwich. From 1837 to 1844 Ransom served as Major General of the Vermont Militia, and he published a manual on tactics for militia that was distributed throughout United States, "Military Tactics and Instructions For The Use Of The Volunteers and Militia of the United States". In 1844 Ransom was appointed Norwich University's President, the first to hold the office after Alden Partridge.
A Democrat, Ransom ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1840. He ran again in 1843, losing twice to Jacob Collamer. In 1846 he was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor, losing to Leonard Sargeant.
Mexican-American War.
Ransom volunteered to serve in the Mexican War and, on February 16, 1847, was appointed as the Major of the newly formed 9th Infantry Regiment under the command of future President Colonel Franklin Pierce. He was quickly promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and second in command, and when Pierce was promoted to Brigadier General and took command of a brigade, Ransom was promoted to Colonel on March 16 and given command of the regiment (which was officially organized on April 9).
The regiment served in the Mexico City campaign and was in the Battle of Contreras, Battle of Churubusco, and Battle of Molino del Rey.
Ransom fell at the head of the regiment on September 13, 1847 while storming the works at Chapultepec on the outskirts of Mexico City. He was remembered by Richard Coulter Drum, a participant in the battle as "by all odds the most brilliant man under fire I have ever seen."
Death and burial.
Ransom was temporarily buried in Mexico City's Protestant cemetery, and later returned to Vermont and interred at Norwich's Fairview Cemetery. His eulogy was spoken by Frederic Williams Hopkins, the Adjutant General of Vermont, who had worked with Ransom to revitalize the militia.
Legacy.
Norwich University's Ransom Hall is named for Truman Ransom. Battery Ransom, an artillery fortification that stood on Fort Jackson, Louisiana was also named for him.
Family.
Ransom married Margaretta Morrison Greenfield in 1830. They had seven children: Dunbar Richard (1831-1897); Thomas Edwin Greenfield (1834-1864); Mary Rozella (1837-1843); George Richard (1839-1845); Frederick Eugene (1841-1918); Mary Rozella (named for a sister who predeceased her, born and died in 1843); and Catherine Harriet (b. 1846).
Thomas Edward Greenfield Ransom served as a brevet major general in the Union Army during American Civil War and died in service on October 29, 1864. Dunbar Ransom served as a Civil War officer and later became a railroad executive before dying in Texas. Frederick Ransom served as a lieutenant in the 11th Illinois Infantry during the Civil War.

<doc id="36887832" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36887832" title="National Socialist Liberation Front">
National Socialist Liberation Front

The National Socialist Liberation Front was originally established as a youth wing of the National Socialist White People's Party in 1969. In 1974 it was reconstituted as a separate National Socialist organization after its leader Joseph Tommasi had been expelled by NSWPP leader Matt Koehl.
History.
The NSLF was established in 1969 by Tommasi, with the backing of William Luther Pierce, as a campus based revolutionary organization to compete with militant New Left militant groups. Ideological as well as personal differences began to develop between Tommassi and Koehl. At the Partys second congress in 1970, Tommasi denounced the conservative old guard of the party and called for immediate revolution. Koehl expelled him from the Party in 1973, claiming that he was smoking marijuana and entertaining young women at party headquarters, as well as misuse of party funds. One of the NSLFs recruits during this period was Louisiana State University student David Duke.
The NSLF was reconstituted as a new organization on March 2, 1974 "in the presence of 43 National Socialist revolutionaries" in El Monte, California. The NSLF broke with established National Socialist tradition, eschewing browshirt uniforms and abandoning attempts to raise a "mass movement" of supporters to win power legalistically. Instead, Tommasi argued that it was best for small bands of "National Socialist revolutionaries" to arm themselves and conduct guerrilla warfare. The new organization was structured as a two tiered entity, with a legal "aboveground" membership - which at most included forty members - and a smaller "underground" that was dedicated to violent, revolutionary action. This group included Tommasi, Karl Hand, David Rust and James Mason, the latter of whom was not an official member of the NSLF.
Joseph Tommasi was killed at the El Monte headquarters of the NSWPP in August 1975 and was succeeded by Lt. David Rust, who was soon arrested on a weapons charge. Units of the group formed in Cincinnati, Buffalo, Wilmington, Delaware and Louisiana. James Mason would take part of the following in Ohio out in 1982 to form the Universal Order, a group that promoted the ideas of Charles Manson as a continuation of National Socialism, and took with them the periodical "Siege!", though the parting was reportedly amicable. By that time Karl Hand headed the group and published "Defiance". Under Hand the NSLF went back to the earlier model of uniformed political demonstrations and legality. However, the organization would come to an end with Hands arrest on a weapons charge in the mid-1980s.

Square Roots

Square Roots (previously called the Folk & Roots Festival) is a two- to three-day music festival that has been held each summer in the Lincoln Square neighborhood in Chicago since 1998. Organized by the Old Town School of Folk Music and the Lincoln Square Chamber of Commerce, the festival features world music and dance performances from a variety of genres with particular emphasis on folk and world music.
History.
The Folk & Roots Festival began in 1998 and was coordinated solely by the Old Town School of Folk Music. Each year the event was held at Welles Park in Lincoln Square. The festival showcased a variety of performances from different musical traditions. For instance, in 2001, the festival hosted, among others, the Super Rail Band from Mali, Nigerian afrobeat musician Femi Kuti, and the Texan country band The Flatlanders. It also featured well-known folk performers as well, such as Patti Smith and Richard Thompson. The lineup of performances at Folk & Roots festivals have been described as "eclectic." In addition to performances, The Folk & Roots Festival also held dance workshops and events for children. 
In 2012, the Old Town School of Folk Music announced they would not be organizing the Folk & Roots Festival in 2012. This decision may have been based on changes in city policy that would have added significant financial burden to the school, such as increased costs in permits and rentals in Welles Park for performance space and no longer allowing vendors at the festival to use the city's power grid for electrical needs. However, Old Town School of Folk Music's executive director stated that the reason for the cancellation was to create a new festival that would highlight the school's new building completed in 2011. It is not clear if the festival will be planned for 2013, but the Old Town School of Folk Music director, Bau Graves, noted that he wouldn't "close the door" on bringing Folk & Roots back in the future.
Square Roots.
Like the Folk and Roots Festival, Square Roots has also hosted performances from a variety of music traditions. In its first year in 2012, Square Roots hosted the country group Waco Brothers, Malian blues singer Sidi Touré, funk band Kong Fuzi, and Colorado folk quintet Elephant Revival, among others. 
Another focus of the festival is on supporting local businesses. Lincoln Square Chamber of Commerce vice president Jason Kraus has expressed that ideally, 80 to 100 percent of the food vendors would be from neighborhoods around Lincoln Square, such as Ravenswood or Northcenter. In 2012, Square Roots invited numerous local restaurants and breweries as vendors during the festival. Square Roots is expected to continue in 2013.
In 2012, entrance to the Square Roots fest was as suggested $10 donation for adults, and was discounted for children and seniors. Proceeds went to the Old Town School of Folk Music and the Lincoln Square Chamber of Commerce to benefit music programs, summer concerts, music education, and local farmer's markets in the area.

The club again participated in the Federation Cup in 2011 where Pailan won two matches but lost one which meant that they would finish 2nd behind Salgaocar and thus meant Pailan were knocked out in the group stage again. Pailan Arrows then began their 2011–12 I-League campaign against Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium on 23 October 2012 in which they lost 1–3 after Lalrozama Fanai gave them the early lead.

Towards the end of the season Pailan managed to win two matches, one against Chirag United Club Kerala and another against HAL to finished the season in 13th place out of 14 teams but since they are a developmental team, Pailan were not relegated.

Pailan though, however, failed to end the month of November on a bright note as the fell to their third loss of the month in five games on the 28 November 2012 against Shillong Lajong F.C. by a score of 3–1 at the Nehru Stadium in Shillong with Tirthankar Sarkar being the lone scorer for Pailan in the 67th minute after Lajong scored through Sushil Kumar Singh in the 3rd and 49th minutes and Gbeneme Friday in the 52nd minute.
Despite the rough month of November Pailan Arrows began the month of December with a bang on the 1 December 2012 with a 4–1 victory over ONGC F.C. at the Salt Lake Stadium with Deepak Devrani scoring his first goal of his career for Pailan in the 10th minute before ONGC equalized through Liberian Eric Brown in the 21st minute but Holicharan Narzary scored his fourth league goal of the season in the 25th minute to give Pailan the lead before Milan Singh scored in the 57th minute from the penalty spot and Alwyn George scored his first goal of the season in the 82nd minute to confirm Pailan's mega victory. There after however Pailan were brought back down to earth in their next match against Churchill Brothers S.C. on the 10 December 2012 at the Salt Lake Stadium when they lost 3–0 with Bineesh Balan and Beto providing the goals for Churchill Brothers. Pailan then had 12 days to prepare for their next match against Dempo S.C. as their match against Mohun Bagan A.C. for the 15 December 2012 was postponed; when Pailan played Dempo on the 22 December 2012 at the Salt Lake Stadium they once again saw themselves lose with Joaquim Abranches scoring both the goals for Dempo in the 10th and 59th minutes of the match while Milan Singh scored the equalizer for Pailan in between from the penalty spot in the 45th minute before halftime. Pailan Arrows however then ended the month of December and the year 2012 with their third defeat in a row when they lost 3–0 to East Bengal at the Kalyani Stadium on 30 December 2012 with Robin Singh and Sanju Pradhan doing the damage against the Pailan Arrows.
The club then failed to begin the year 2013 on a good start when they fell to ONGC, a club they had beaten 4–1 only a month earlier, by a score of 3–0 with Pritam Kotal scoring an own goal for Pailan in the 6th minute before goals from Eric Brown and Lalnun Puia scoring the other two goals for ONGC in the 30th and 67th minutes of the match. The club then succumbed to their fifth defeat of the season on 9 January 2013 against Churchill Brothers at the Duler Stadium in which the club lost 3–1 due to a double by Gabon international striker Henry Antchouet and a goal by Israil Gurung all within five minutes from the 60th to the 65th minutes of the match; Pailan did have the lead though when Prathamesh Maulingkar put Arrows in the lead in the 56th minute. Despite their fifth loss of the season though, Pailan Arrows still managed to break that run in the very next match against Air India on 12 January 2013 at the Balewadi Sports Complex in which Pailan Arrows drew the match 1–1 with Rajinder Kumar giving Arrows the equalizer they needed right before halftime, after Henry Ezeh put Air India in the lead in the 37th minute.

Bruce Rappaport

Baruch "Bruce" Rappaport (February 15, 1922 – January 8, 2010) was an international banker and financier. He was born in Haifa, Mandatory Palestine to Russian-Jewish emigre parents.
Bank of New York.
In 1982, Rappaport filed the required paperwork to declare his 7.5% ownership of Bank of New York.
On August 19, 1999, the Bank of New York (BoNY) admitted to co-operating with an investigation into a $10 billion money-laundering operation. Bruce Rappaport was a focus of the investigation and also his other bank, Bank of New York-InterMaritime, a Swiss bank that conducted a large amount of Russian business. In addition to Bruce Rappaport, another Bank of New York (BoNY) employee, Natasha Kagalovsky, who is married to Konstantin Kagalovsky, was a focus of investigations.
In 1999, a shareholder lawsuit was filed against the Bank of New York. In the complaint the accusations against Rappaport, and Bank of New York, included money laundering, accusations of Russian organized crime involvement, and described Rappaport as "an international financier of questionable background".
BCCI.
In 1987, Independent Counsel Robert McKay investigated Bruce Rappaport for activities he engaged in on behalf of CIA director William Casey. These activities included the purchasing of an Antiguan melon-farm for Israeli arms dealers who were significant customers of BCCI in Miami and placing Alfred Hartmann (BCCI employee) on the board of directors of Intermaritime Bank of Geneva and New York.
Rappaport was also the person who allegedly controlled bank accounts which received $10 million for the Contras. Swiss authorities told the Iran/Contra Committees that the $10 million had disappeared, and was found to have "mistakenly" gone to a Swiss businessman, who then returned the money after the Iran/Contra affair was discovered. Press accounts contended that the businessman was Rappaport.
Indonesia.
During the early 1970s, General Ibnu Sutowo, signed numerous oil-tanker charter deals with Bruce Rappaport to provide oil transport for Pertamina.
In April 1977, General Ibnu Sutowo was placed under house arrest for his dealings with Rappaport. Rappaport was accused of price gouging and bringing Pertamina, and Indonesia, to bankruptcy.
Iraq–Jordan Pipeline Scandal.
During the 1980s, James McKay, an independent prosecutor, was appointed to investigate alleged financial improprieties by Edwin Meese while he was attorney general. As part of this investigation, McKay looked into Meese's involvement in a Bechtel pipeline deal in the Middle East. The pipeline was to extend from Iraq to Jordan and was negotiated by Edwin Meese, Shimon Perez, Bruce Rappaport, Robert C. McFarlane, and others.
During the investigation, Bruce Rappaport was offered immunity from prosecution as long as he did not perjure himself. Rapport later refused to attend his deposition for fear "he might not remember everything accurately".
Rappaport's alleged role was to bribe Israeli officials in the Shimon Peres government and ensure that portions of the $1 billion project were funneled to the Israeli Labor Party. Later, in 2006, Shimon Peres was investigated for an illegal $100,000 campaign contribution from Bruce Rappaport.
Charity.
Bruce Rappaport contributed to the establishment of the Technion's Faculty of Medicine building (est. 1979), and founded the Technion's Rappaport Research Institute.
In Geneva, Switzerland Rappaport gave millions of dollars to Jewish and non-Jewish organizations, including orphanages, day care centers, research institutes and hospitals in the United States, Israel and elsewhere. His wife, Ruth Rappaport, was the co-President of the Geneva branch of the Women's International Zionist Organization.

Mark Meadows (North Carolina politician)

Mark Randall Meadows (born July 28, 1959) is an American politician who has been the U.S. Representative for North Carolina's 11th congressional district since January 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Early life, education, and business career.
Meadows was born in Verdun, France and grew up in Brandon, Florida. He graduated from the University of South Florida after briefly studying at Florida State University. During his collegiate years, Meadows joined Sigma Chi Fraternity. In 2011 he moved to Cashiers, North Carolina, where he now lives.
In 1987, Meadows started a small restaurant. He later sold it, and used the proceeds to start a development company in Florida.
U.S. House of Representatives.
2012 election.
In late 2011, Meadows announced he was running for Congress in North Carolina's 11th congressional district, for the seat being vacated by Democratic incumbent Heath Shuler. The district had been significantly altered in redistricting. New lines were drawn straight through the middle of Warren Wilson College. Notably, it lost most of Asheville to the 10th district, while picking up some heavily Republican territory in the foothills. The old 11th had a slight Republican lean, but the new 11th was on paper the most Republican district in the state. In 2011, the North Carolina State Legislature in a state that has 13 districts, re-drew the congressional districts in 2011 based on updated population information from the 2010 census. As a result the district which is now "91.2% White, 3.0% Black, 1.4% Native American and 1.0% Asian." District 11 now includes the counties of Buncombe (Asheville), Clay, Cherokee, Graham, Haywood, Henderson (Hendersonville), Jackson (Waynesville), Macon, McDowell (Marion), Madison, Polk, Swain, Transylvania (Brevard) and Yancey (Burnsville).
He won the Republican primary runoff, in July 2012, and in the general election in November, faced the Democratic candidate, Hayden Rogers, who had been Shuler's chief of staff. During the campaign, on August 28, 2012, Meadows spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida.
Meadows won the general election with approximately 57 percent of the vote and took office, in January 2013.
Tenure.
Meadows has signed the Contract from America, a list of ten policies assembled by the Tea Party movement.
Meadows voted against relief for Hurricane Sandy along with a group of other Republicans who cited pork barrel spending in the relief bill that had nothing to do with hurricane relief.
Meadows is a fiscal conservative and is part of a group that has advocated for a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. In addition he opposed the recent federal stimulus spending and has expressed desire for the federal spending growth rate to be capped at the inflation rate. He supports a moratorium on all earmarks until the budget has been balanced. Meadows opposes any cuts to military spending levels.
Meadows has signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, and he opposes a raise in all taxes, including the income tax. Meadows supports a flat-rate income tax for all income-earners, and a repeal of the raise in the capital gains tax. He also supports the elimination of the estate tax.
Meadows supports lowering corporate tax rates as a strategy to promote new employment and thus create more jobs. In addition he has called for free trade.
Meadows opposes any restrictions on gun purchases and opposes a national gun registry that would list detailed information about firearm ownership.
Meadows has stated that cap-and-trade emission policies are ineffective and have minimal impact on the global environment. He has proposed that the United States should tap into oil and gas reserves to keep energy prices low, and to develop energy independence. He supports tapping into off-shore oil and gas supplies.
Meadows opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare"), and states that it should be replaced by private enterprise.
Meadows is a pro-life supporter and has called abortion a 'tragedy'. He opposes any federal funding for abortion and believes parents should be notified of underage abortion procedures. He also opposes churches and other religious sites providing birth control options.
Meadows opposes same-sex marriage. In March 2013 he stated that if the Supreme Court allowed gay marriage, it would cause a constitutional crisis if the Federal government decided to dismiss state decisions and thus infringe on state's rights.
Role in the 2013 federal government shutdown.
Meadows has been described as playing an important part of the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. On August 21, 2013 Meadows wrote an open letter to House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor encouraging them to "affirmatively de-fund the implementation and enforcement of Obamacare in any relevant appropriations bills brought to the House floor in the 113th Congress, including any continuing appropriations bill." The document was signed by 79 of Meadows' colleagues in the House. Heritage Action (which opened operations in North Carolina in January 2011), ran critical Internet advertisements in the districts of 100 Republican lawmakers who failed to sign the letter by Meadows. The letter has been described as being controversial within the Republican Party. 
The "New York Daily News" said Meadows put the federal government on the road to shutdown, saying calls to defund "Obamacare" through spending bills languished until Meadows wrote his letter. Meadows downplayed his influence, saying "I'm one of 435 members and a very small part of this." CNN described Meadows as the "architect of the brink" for his letter suggesting that "Obamacare" be defunded in any continuing appropriations bill. Meadows said that was sensationalizing his role. 
John Ostendorff of the "Asheville Citizen-Times" wrote Meadows "said it's best to close the government in the short term to win a delay on 'Obamacare', despite the potential negative impact on the economy." Ostendorff wrote that Meadows said he was doing what Tea Party members in Western North Carolina wanted him to do. Meadows said his constituents wanted him to fight against "Obamacare" "regardless of consequences." Jane Bilello, head of the Asheville Tea Party and political action committee said Meadows "truly represents us" on the issue of "Obamacare". Meadows reportedly holds conference calls with members of the Asheville Tea Party, telling them what's going on in Congress, and about challenges he faces promoting their agenda.
In public comments, Meadows stated he was working on a compromise that involved passing appropriations bills that would fund only parts of the government, such as a bill to fund the National Park Service, Smithsonian Institution, National Gallery of Art, and United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and a bill to fund the National Institutes of Health. However, partial or "mini" funding bills were rejected by the Democratic majority in the United States Senate.

Gibbons Mansion, currently known as Mead Hall, is a historical mansion on Drew University campus in Madison, Morris County, New Jersey, United States. It houses the university's administrative offices today. 
It was built by William Gibbons beginning in 1833 in the heart of his 96-acre property; it was first occupied in 1836. Gibbons’ only son, William Heyward, sold the vacant mansion and estate to Daniel Drew in 1867 for $140,000. Drew, in turn, the Drew Theological Seminary, named in his honor. The Gibbons mansion was renamed Mead Hall, in honor of Drew's wife, Roxanna Mead.
Mead Hall was devastated by a fire in 1989, reopened in 1993, and despite the damage, is still “considered the finest example of Greek Revival architecture north of the Mason-Dixon line."

The Open Solar Outdoors Test Field

The Open Solar Outdoors Test Field (OSOTF) is a project organized under open source principles, which is a fully grid-connected test system that continuously monitors the output of many solar photovoltaic modules and correlates their performance to a long list of highly accurate meteorological readings.
History.
As the solar photovoltaic industry grows there is an increased demand for high-quality research in solar systems design and optimization in realistic (and sometimes extreme) outdoor environments such as in Canada. To answer this need, a partnership has formed the Open Solar Outdoors Test Field (OSOTF). The OSOTF was originally developed with a strong partnership between the Queen's Applied Sustainability Research Group run by Joshua M. Pearce at Queen’s University (now at Michigan Tech) and the Sustainable Energy Applied Research Centre (SEARC) at St. Lawrence College headed by Adegboyega Babasola.
This collaboration has grown rapidly to include multiple industry partners and the OSOTF has been redesigned to provide critical data and research for the team.
The OSOTF is a fully grid-connected test system, which continuously monitors the output of over 100 photovoltaic modules and correlates their performance to a long list of highly accurate meteorological readings. The teamwork has resulted in one of the largest systems in the world for this detailed level of analysis, and can provide valuable information on the actual performance of photovoltaic modules in real-world conditions. Unlike many other projects, the OSOTF is organized under open source principles.
"All data and analysis when completed will be made freely available to the entire photovoltaic community and the general public." 
The first project for the OSOTF quantifies the losses due to snowfall of a solar photovoltaic system, generalizes these losses to any location with weather data and recommends best practices for system design in snowy climates. This work was accomplished by creating a synthetic day using empirical data from the OSOTF. This application of the OSOTF has been covered extensively in the media.
Partners.
This system has been made possible by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and contributions and collaborations from:
The development of this test facility is a testament to the commitment of the photovoltaic industry to continuous innovation, and the researchers hope that it will be a valuable tool for ensuring the development of a sustainable power system worldwide.
Open Solar Outdoors Test Field.
The SEARC Open Solar Outdoors Test Field consists of two discreet test beds, the largest of which is located on the roof of the new Wind Turbine and Trades building at St.Lawrence College and which has room for 60 commercial PV panels, which are divided between eight angles of 5.10,15,20,30,40,50 and 60 degrees. Live video for the test field is openly available online. Full data access available here.
The second test field is located on a flat rooftop at St.Lawrence College and consists of two commercial flat roof ballasted systems. Live video of this test field is also available online
In addition the Queen's Innovation Park Test Site which was developed as part of a preliminary study on the effects of snow on photovoltaic performance funded by Sustainable Energy Technologies. It consists of 16 panels mounted at angles from 0 to 70 degrees, with two each at increments of 10 degrees. By monitoring panel output, solar influx, snow fall and meteorological factors a loss due to snowfall can be determined for a general system at a variety of angles. In addition, thermal panel measurements lead to a better understanding of snow shedding mechanisms. A series of analysis algorithms have been developed which allow for constant data mining to determine factors such as snow coverage ratio using image analysis, performance ratio, and estimated losses/gains due to snowfall. A detailed description of the sensors and measurements used in the study can be seen below.
Specifications.
The Open Solar Outdoors Test Field is designed to be a state-of-the-art outdoors test facility which makes this site one of the premier PV test beds in North America.The capabilities of this test bed are shown in the following table.

Section Eleven of the Constitution of South Africa

Section Eleven of the Constitution of South Africa, part of the Bill of Rights, guarantees the right to life. This section has been interpreted to prohibit the death penalty, but not to prohibit abortion. It also has important implications for euthanasia, self-defence, the use of force by law enforcement, and the provision of life-saving healthcare.
Under the heading "Life", the section states, in full, ""Everyone has the right to life."" Unlike the right to life in many other human rights instruments, this section is unqualified; it does not make an exception for the death penalty, but neither does it explicitly state that the death penalty is forbidden.
Death penalty.
One of the first decisions by the Constitutional Court was the 1995 case of "S v Makwanyane", in which the court addressed the constitutionality of the death penalty. The principal judgment, by President of the Court Arthur Chaskalson, found the death penalty to be unconstitutional not because it violated the right to life, but because it violated the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment elsewhere in the Bill of Rights. However, a majority of the judges of the court held that the death penalty also violated the right to life.
In the 2001 case of "Mohamed v President of the Republic of South Africa" the Constitutional Court dealt with the extradition of suspects under circumstances where they may face the death penalty. The court held that the South African government cannot extradite suspects for capital offences without obtaining an assurance from the jurisdiction requesting extradition that they will not be sentenced to death (or that, if they are, the death penalty will not be carried out). This was reaffirmed in the 2012 case of "Minister of Home Affairs v Tsebe". However these protections do not extend to South African citizens outside South Africa: in "Kaunda v President of the Republic of South Africa" the court held that the South African government was not obliged to intervene diplomatically to protect South African citizens being extradited from Zimbabwe to Equatorial Guinea on capital charges.
Abortion.
The Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1996, which permits abortion on demand in the first trimester and for broadly-specified reasons in the second trimester, was challenged in "Christian Lawyers' Association v Minister of Health", on the basis that it violated the foetus' right to life. The Transvaal Provincial Division of the High Court dismissed the case, ruling that the word "everyone" in section 11 does not extend to unborn foetuses, which do not have legal personality under the Bill of Rights.

Invasion of Port Harcourt

The Invasion of Port Harcourt (March 8 - May 24, 1968) was a military conflict between Nigerian and Biafran military forces.
Background.
In the mid 1960s people from the Hausa and Fulani groups in Nigeria decided to start the Anti-Igbo sentiment against the Igbo people of southern Nigeria. This resulted in the killings of thousands of Igbo's and the evacuation of hundreds of thousands more Igbo's from northern Nigeria. In 1967 Col.Odumegwu Ojukwu dclared that the Igbo people seceded from northern Nigeria to form the Republic of Biafra. Soon after the announcing of their secession the Nigerian's took control of many large cities in Biafra even their capital Enugu. In May 1969 Gen.Benjamin Adekunle surrounded the major city of Port Harcourt. On May 19, 1968 Adekunle and force of men invaded the city.
Battle.
Following the defeat in the Cross River region the Biafrans regrouped the remnants of their troops and created the Biafran 12th Division under the command of Lt. Col. Festus Akagha. The 12th Division was divided into the 56th Brigade stationed in Arochukwu and the 58th Brigade stationed in Uyo. On March 8, 1968 the beaches at Oron come under heavy Nigerian aerial and naval bombardment. The Nigerian 33rd Brigade under Col. Ted Hamman managed to overrun Biafran defensive positions and continued towards Uyo. Due to the swiftness of the Nigerian advance Biafran officers began to loose control of their troops. Consequently, hundreds of Biafran troops were cut off and forced to surrender after Nigerian troops stationed at Oron linked up with he Nigerian 16th and 17th Brigade in Uyo. The 16th Brigade under Col. E.A. Etuk and 17th Brigade under Lt. Col. Philemon Shande stormed through Eket and occupied Opobo. With the Biafrans in retreat the Nigerian 15th Brigade under Col. Ipoola Alani Akinrinade stationed at Bonny launched an attack on Port Harcourt. At the time Port Harcourt was defended by the Biafran 52nd Brigade under Col. Ogbugo Kalu. After heavy fighting Nigerian troops capture and dig-in at Onne, this success would be short lived. A division of Biafran soldiers under an Italian-born Biafran mercenary unexpectedly counter-attacked, inflicting heavy casualties before forcing the Nigerians to retreat from Onne. The Biafran 14th Battalion stationed in Bori panicked and retreated from the town after spotting Nigerian soldiers wearing the insignia of the Nigerian 14th Brigade. As Biafran lines around Port Harcourt crumbled a message was sent over Radio Biafra for the defense of the city. On May 19 the Biafran Maj. Joseph Achuzie arrived in Port Harcourt and was made commander of Biafran troops defending the city. Port Harcourt was subjected to heavy Nigerian artillery bombardment while defending Biafran troops fiercely resisted. During 5 days of heavy fighting Port Harcourt's airport and army barracks changed hands on numerous occasions but by May 24 most Biafran troops had been pushed out of the city into the surrounding areas. Maj. Achuzie stubbornly continued to fight against the Nigerians before narrowly escaping death after almost being run over by an armored car, it was then when Maj. Achuzie abandoned fighting and retreated to Igrita.
Aftermath.
The next day Gen. Adekunle said his famous announcement "I will be able to capture Owerri, Aba, and Umuahia in 2 weeks. That quote then led up to Operation OAU. Nigerian forces weren't able to captures the cities of Owerri and Aba until October 1, 1968 and were unable to capture Umuahia for another year. On January 15, 1970 Biafra surrendered to Nigeria and ended the war.

International Youth Meeting Center in Oświęcim/Auschwitz

The International Youth Meeting Center in Oświęcim/Auschwitz is an educational institution whose campus lies between the center of the Polish city of Oświęcim and the former German concentration camp of Auschwitz. More than one million persons, mostly Jewish and Polish, were murdered at Auschwitz during the Second World War (1939–1945). Proposed in 1971, the Center was opened in 1986 following years of planning, negotiations, and fundraising. It seeks to "develop the understanding of National Socialism and its consequences, particularly among young Germans, through dialogue and encounter between people of different origins", and is particularly engaged with Germans and Poles, Christians and Jews. In 2010, the Center hosted more than 17,000 overnight stays by youth groups participating in its programs. Many young Germans and Austrians have held year-long voluntary positions at the Center that satisfy their civilian service ("Zivildienst") responsibility. One of these, Robert Thalheim, wrote and directed the German-language dramatic film "And Along Come Tourists" (2007) that features the Center and its activities.
The Polish and German names for the Center are Międzynarodowy Dom Spotkań Młodzieży w Oświęcimiu and Internationale Jugendbegegnungsstätte in Oświęcim/Auschwitz, respectively; the two names are conjoined in the abbreviation MDSM/IJBS for the Center.
History.
The idea for the construction of a youth meeting center in Poland came from Volker von Törne (1934–1980), who saw an opportunity for creating it following the signing of the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and Poland. von Törne was a poet and then business manager of the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace (ARSP), which is a private German organization ("Aktion Sühnezeichen Friedensdienst") working towards reconciliation with countries and peoples harmed during German occupation in World War II. Following von Törne's death in 1980, Christoph Heubner led the project for ARSP. In a 1986 interview, Heubner explained the importance of placing the Center near Auschwitz, which "symbolized the lowest point in German-Polish history, the lowest point in Jewish-German relations, one of the lowest points in man's inhumanity to man. The motivation to speak with one another is greater there. The greater emotion opens people up more for dialogue than would be the case in Masuria area in northeast Poland or in some sunny mountain meadow."
In the late 1970s and early 1980s the proposal was very controversial. The location of the buildings, the architecture of the project, the operations as well as the Polish partner for the ARSP were contentious issues. In 1978, Andreas Maislinger unsuccessfully approached President Rudolf Kirchschläger about Austrian support for the project.
The project received the support of many survivors of the concentration camps at Dachau, Stutthof, Buchenwald and Auschwitz, and by December 1985 a turning point was reached. Alfred Przybylski, former prisoner #471 at the Auschwitz camp and the representative of the Union of Polish Architects, supported by the plans drawn up by German architect Helmut Morlok, contributed decisively to the realization of the project.
After obtaining contributions of 4.6 million Deutschmarks ($2.1 million), sufficient for 2/3 of the construction costs, ground was finally broken in May 1986. The handoff of the initial buildings to the foundation that operates it was celebrated on December 7, 1986, which was the sixteenth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw. The entire building project was completed in October, 1998. The Center is primarily supported by the Polish municipality of Oświęcim and by the ARSP, which sponsors three such centers. In 2010, the Center hosted more than 17,000 overnight stays by youth groups participating in its programs.
The Center has become well known in German-speaking Europe following release of the dramatic film "Am Ende kommen Touristen" (2007) ("And Along Come Tourists"), which was partly filmed at the Center. The film was written and directed by Robert Thalheim. While the film's characters and story are fictional, in writing the screenplay Thalheim drew from his own experience as a German civilian service worker at the Center in 1996-97.
Facilities.
The Center is on one bank of the Soła river, and consists of several pavilions laid out around a large garden. There is a forum, a multi-purpose room, a library, and four seminar rooms. There are about one hundred beds, as well as a campground and a sports field.
Katrin Buchholz has described the architecture as follows: "Modesty in construction and form, simplicity in the interior furnishings, ... the center of the campus is a meeting place that is open in all directions ... where all can move or loiter freely and unobserved, and in which one can find community but also security, as well as time and space to be alone."
Programming.
The Center sponsors activities of several types, including workshops to bring together groups of Polish and German students, seminars and development programs for adults and teachers, and exhibitions for general visitors. Groups using the Center typically stay for four or five days. In addition to visits to the remains of the concentration camps Auschwitz I, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Auschwitz III-Monowitz, groups can plan excursions in the area, especially to the city of Kraków, and conversations can be arranged with experts on the major concerns of the Center.
The Center has been among the sites for the work of young German and Austrian citizens doing civilian service ("Zivildienst") sponsored by the ARSP, the German "Internationaler Bund", and by the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service.

BONZZO (comic strip)

BONZZO The Comic Strip is a comic strip created by John Rivas.
History.
About BONZZO.
Rivas describes "BONZZO" as a young likable adult facing life with a mental disability. His comic strip represents our daily lives,
as well as reminds us of ideas, happy events and how we filtered each moment in our lives. “Bonzzo comes from a character I had to promote my advertising agency. The concept went from there, until I took it to the graphic stage of a comic strip. Fernando Roque helped me with the illustrations”, Rivas said. Since then, Bonzzo went from an inanimate object, to a comic strip published by the main island newspapers, since 1998. “When I created it, I did not name it. So I put all of the letters from the alphabet in a bag, and I took letters out until the name Bonzzo was complete”, he said.
BONZZO was first published in 1998 in two of the four leading newspapers in Puerto Rico, El Mundo and El Vocero (there are no syndicates in Puerto Rico). The coomic strips were published in both newspapers daily. Later, it was published on El Reportero newspaper in Huntsville, Alabama. It was also published, years later, on the Primera Hora newspaper in Puerto Rico.
During his tenure, Bonzzo has found different characters that little by little have been integrated into his life. For instance, Tridy, his extraterrestrial best friend; Tirillas, his spoiled cat who only wants to be fed; Ego Causa, Bonzzo’s lawyer, mentor, and adviser; andas always, there is also the eternal love, Bogzzy, who is in love with Bonzzo andtries to capture his attention with her doey and seductive gaze. Nonetheless, she is happy with just being friends.
While U.S. syndication is one of Rivas's immediate goals, he also hopes to create a "BONZZO" theme park, "Bonzzolandia".
First USPS Pictorial Cancellation.
On July 30, 1999 BONZZO had its First United States Postal Service (USPS) Pictorial Cancellation, in which the Plaza Las Americas Postal Store, located in San Juan, PR, became "BONZZO Station".
Big Comic Strips Expo.
In 1999, BONZZO had a Big Comic Strips Expo at Plaza Las Americas Mall.
BONZZO and NASA.
In 1999, Rivas exposed four of BONZZO's NASA themed comic strips at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, FL on its Hispanic Luncheon & Art Show, which was dedicated to him. Rivas designed some special "BONZZO" strips commemorating NASA's achievements, including "Beyond the Moon", a calendar of the year 2000 honoring Hispanic heritage.
"NASA's BONZZO Award".
NASA also instated the BONZZO Award, a pint-size BONZZO statue that will be given annually to the individual who makes the biggest contribution to NASA's Hispanic program. On October 12, 2000, Charles H. Scales, the director of Equal Opportunity at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, was the first recipient of this award: the statue was signed by Marshall Center Director Art Stephenson, Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rosselló and John Rivas, who donated
the statue to honor the work of Hispanics at the Marshall Center. “Charles is an excellent choice for this first award,” said Elia Ordonez, Hispanic Employment Program manager at the Marshall Center. “He has contributed much to the quality of life in our community and, in particular, the Hispanic community at Marshall.”
NASA celebrated last year's "Hispanic Heritage Month" at the Kennedy Space Center with an exhibit of "BONZZO" comic strips. A life-sized BONZZO figure marched in the 2004 Puerto Rican Day Parade celebrated in New York City.
Website.
On October 2011, BONZZO had its own website were you can see the beginnings and trajectory of this comic strip, informative capsules and daily comic strips. As H. J. Leonard said: "He has had lunch with governors, but he is not a government official. He has traveled through space, but he is not an astronaut. He has strolled with magazine owners, but he is not a businessman. Even famed boxer Tito Trinidad has fond memories of him, hanging in a wall at his studio. With his yellow shirt, blue pants and red snickers, this young man, who has made us laugh with his adventures in newspaper comic strips, will now move his comedic career to the Internet." Leonard also said: "The Internet then becomes a useful tool. “It is very sad that newspapers don’t give caricaturists a break”, Rivas said, lamenting the island’s situation. “Originally, the comics appeared in newspapers, they were part of them. It was something that helped to sell newspapers and reach more people. This is how I began to check the Internet. I then became intrigued by projects in the web and the social networks”, he said. “Projects that help other people see these artistic works and give you an opportunity.” "
Second USPS Pictorial Cancellation & First USPS Commemorative Stamp.
On May 10, 2012, BONZZO had its Second USPS Pictorial Cancellation, in which the General Archive of Puerto Rico, located in San Juan, PR, became "The Art of Bonzzo at the General Archive of Puerto Rico Station".
Manuel A. Benítez said in its article: "In a grand event held at the Puerto Rico General Archives in Puerta de Tierra, the Federal U.S. Postal Service approved an official postage stamp with the award winning caricature of Bonzzo, creation of Puerto Rican artist and publicist, John Rivas."
"Rivas explained his relief, not as much for himself, but for the sake of the artistry in comic strips being recognized. And recognized it was, by Secretary of State and acting Governor in the first executive absence, Kenneth McClintock, who participated in the event and emphasized the pride that we all have as Puerto Ricans when our gifted artists are recognized outside our shores.“It was important for me to be here because comic strips are serious art. It takes a lot of thinking to boil complex societal issues within the context of a few visual frames. They are also an intricate part of the news industry of which I once was a part of …,” he continued to explain that the talented people in Puerto Rico should be recognized for their deeds more often than they are and that it behooves us not to understate the accomplishments that bare reason to make us proud.
Dr. Hermán J. Cestero MD, from the Philatelic Society of Puerto Rico put the historic event in perspective by explaining the practice of commemorative stamps. “This is the second US Postal cancellation stamp for Bonzzo and the first time that a Bonzzo postage stamp has been officially made part of the US Postal Service.” He said that the use of the stamp began as a practical form of showing from where the mail originated, later they were used to commemorate important historical events, in benefit to specific causes and made to cover transportation and handling costs. He later continued to explain -in a separate interview- that the Bonzzo Postage Stamp can be used to send a letter and that it wasn’t purely decorative but real postage, with which you can send mail from everywhere in the US and its territories." The main event got on its way with the general manager of the US Postal Service’s Caribbean district Steven Hernández officially announced the approval of the new Bonzzo stamp. The 45 cent postage seal will perpetuate Rivas’ character in Bonzzo in the chronicles of American history. Interestingly, the founder and other members of Puerto Rico’s own “El Gran Combo” where there in support of their fellow artist on the eve of yet another grand tour they are to take across the world, doing shows in central and South America, Europe and then on to Asia and Japan.

Main Characters.
BONZZO
A young adult, facing life with a teenager attitude. It is candid enough to have an alien as a friend without questioning the fact. He always has an idea of his own to solve the problems he faces. Always has a thing for BOGZZY, a girl who apparently refuses him. His clothes are decorated by "faces" (Full Faces), that serves as an editorial expression of his moods. BONZZO is the ambassador of our daily lives. Its apparent simplicity is what leads us to wrap ourselves in his world, that is ours ... and brings a smile to us, as he takes us away, for a moment, from the daily hustle we live in.
BOGZZY
An ambitious young woman, developing, living a healthy life. There is something about BONZZO that attracts her, but she did not let him know clearly, she flirts with him. Her clothing also features the "Full Faces" that BONZZO has. She represents a controversy in the world of BONZZO, because she has a different view of the world, that is exemplified in her elliptical glasses. She is the only character whose eyes are not round, they are slanted.
TRIDY
An eccentric alien, friend of BONZZO, that comes from the planet TRIDYLANDIA. People do not see him as a strange being and accept him as a person, however, the same people sees BONZZO as "someone strange" out of this world. TRIDY has special powers that he uses to help BONZZO when he is in trouble. The earthling vocabulary creates humorous confusions in TRIDY.
TIRILLAS "The Cat"
A cat BONZZO picked one day in the street. He is ungrateful, grumpy, naughty as he can only be. He brings an endless number of problems to BONZZO. His only interest is that BONZZO gives him food.
EGO CAUSA
BONZZO's friend and attorney. He is always in dispute with the daily living. His motto is: "that is the Perversity of Matter", which for him means the true liberation of his spirit and problems. He uses this phrase at all times to describe his situations in daily life, which intentionally cause harm around him and corrupt his customs, with a great negative effect on himself. You can see the effect of the perversity of matter in the advice that he gives BONZZO at all times, full of wisdom, and many others lacking sensitivity. For EGO in his legal profession, everybody has a cause for being guilty, in that way he always has a reason to charge and legally defend them. He is always victorious on legal situations with a verdict in favor of his clients, of innocence. He is very good at his profession, although his personality proves otherwise, as it reflects a level of mediocrity and irresponsibility with his informal way of dressing, with shorts, shirt and tennis shoes; also, his car is full of bumps. He is a mess at first glance, as a first impression for those who do not know him, but for BONZZO, is more than an unconditional friend, is like a father.
FULL FACES
The FACES. This is a power that BONZZO and BOGZZY acquired from TRIDY. These strange characters have round eyes and autonomous expressions, which reflect the mood, the attitudes, etc., like the chorus of Greek tragedy. We must be alert to their expressions because they are intrinsic to BONZZO's world.
Later years.

The Comic Strip is a Serious Thing: BONZZO@CORMO UPR in Utuado.
On December 1, 2012, at 1:00 p.m., John Rivas opened BONZZO’s exposition, “The Comic Strip is a Serious Thing: BONZZO@CORMO UPR in Utuado” at the University of Puerto Rico, Utuado Campus (CORMO). The title of the exhibition: "The comic book is a serious thing," is a line taken from the speech of the Secretary of State of Puerto Rico, Hon. Kenneth D. McClintock, on May 10, 2012, during the opening of "BONZZO's Big Comic Strips Expo: The Art of BONZZO Visit the General Archive of Puerto Rico".
This exposition was divided in two collections. The first one consisted of a selection of BONZZO's Big Comic Strips, digitally illustrated, detailed and expanded to a size of 10 "x 33", digitally printed on canvas with oil ink, which were published in the newspaper El Vocero de Puerto Rico, Primera Hora and bonzzo.com.
The second collection, the "Very BONZZO Persons" (VBP), presented portraits of renowned personalities represented by BONZZO, in a size of 11 "x 14", digitally printed on canvas with oil ink.
Rivas’ work received comments from personalities like painter Dr. Osiris Delgado and painter Antonio J. Molina. Honorable Judge, José A. Andreu García also commented: "“Every time I become a greater a fan of John Rivas and his character BONZZO”".
Dr. Osiris Delgado (painter, art critic, educator, writer and Ex-Director of the Museum of Art, History and Anthropology of the University of Puerto Rico), recognized the work of John Rivas and BONZZO saying:
""John Rivas, artist of the ironical subtlety, has Bonzzo as an accomplice to peek into the world with a spirit of fine joke, quality of expression, ability to sneak into people, things and situations, take secrets, project teachings, make us laugh and give us lessons. For Puerto Rico, I give my vote to Bonzzo. Who better than him to surpass the incognito signified in my girl of the cord? With admiration and affection, Dr. Osiris Delgado”"
Also, painter Antonio J. Molina, who is a member of AICA (International Association of Art Critics) and President of the Puerto Rican Association of the UNESCO, said:
"“Bonzzo is already a known figure in the history of Puerto Rico. With his sympathetic round face he distributes joy by the handful among those who know him... and also helps us to think. With his jokes, grace and wise irony he teaches us aspects and situations of life, which sometimes may escape from us, in a world that goes so fast and distrustful.
"He went to the University of Puerto Rico in Utuado, where students and teachers laughed uproariously, and had more fun that on a carnival, with the tricks and judgments of the singular character."
"Let's get into the Comic Strips Hall, where you can enjoy a lot... as we enjoyed just a few months ago in the seigniorial halls of the General Archive and the National Library, in front of the Muñoz Rivera Park, in Puerta de Tierra, Old San Juan."
"Each comic strip represents a state of opinion, whether festive or serious, and let us say some examples:"
"When the psychiatrist laughs out loud (with the patient lying in the famous divan) it shows an example of how half the world laughs at the other half who suffers..."
"In the comic strip where you can see a subject very happy going to the party, and another one that returns not so happy, it reminds us the saying: "Each one talks about the fair, of how they are doing on it.""
"The comic strip is "a serious thing"... so serious that a tyrant is more afraid of a cartoon in a newspaper... than of six editorials. If not, let the famous French caricaturist Honorato Daumier tell you, who suffered six years of prison in Paris for making a cartoon of King Louis Philippe in the nineteenth century."
"The irony is indescribable on John's comic strip about the monkey's evolution, passing by the erectus man and the Neolithic... the monkey of the comic strip complains about his future, great!"
"You die of laughter, not to say another word, when Bonzzo tells the Discoverer Christopher Columbus, without maps, how to get to Puerto Rico... counting buoys... to the left and to the right. Columbus' face... he does not understand!"
"A very fine and subtle criticism to the advertising agencies that exploit the woman figure in the advertisements is checked when Bonzzo, repeatedly buys and uses the product... and the female... does not appear!"
"The Hall of the Famous Persons with Bonzzo's face is extraordinary. John Rivas' talent impresses us, as in each figure there is a philosophical aspect if we know how to find it... be it George Washington, Einstein, Warhol, La Gioconda, etc.."
"This gallery could be in the most demanding museum in the world, which will give every visitor a less serious aspect than the original as well. The genius of Rivas is that he knows to capture the idiosyncrasy of each model, and in his way convinces us that Bonzzo is a universal being... and human!"
"Therefore we could assert that Bonzzo is a significant sign of our times and of our desire. There he is, looking at us with his childlike eyes, wondering what we want him to say and thereby setting the very useful dialogue for us, to seek and find in modern life, with its advantages and pains, something more positive and cheerful to be happy."
"Bonzzo is more than a graphic sign, that is to say, more than a simple drawing... it is perhaps ourselves asking what are the solutions... and we give them ourselves!"
"A hundred years from now someone will say: What Bonzzo wanted to say to Puerto Ricans from the past? Let us therefore look what he want to say today... and if we are lucky in this one on one dialogue... let's get something useful to our lives and our destinies!"
"I would like to tell you that BONZZO is already my friend and I would like that he would become your friend too.”"

Ana Mae Díaz

Ana Mae Diaz de Endara (born c. 1966) was the First Lady of Panama from 1990-1994. 
A Panamanian of Chinese origin, Diaz met future president Guillermo Endara in September 1989, while he was on hunger strike to protest the autocratic military rule of Manuel Noriega. Diaz was a law student at the time. Marcela Endara, Guillermo's wife of 28 years, had died in June of a heart attack while Endara was hospitalized due to a beating by Noriega's forces. International observers had reported Endara to be the clear leader in the May presidential election, and during the US invasion of Panama in December, he was sworn in as president. 
Panamanian newspapers began to publish photographs of Diaz and Endara together in January 1990, and Endara told press the pair were "going out". The pair married on June 11, 1990, in a wedding attended by the ambassadors of various nations. Endara was reportedly so happy in the marriage that he would even leave cabinet meetings for a "quick cuddle". Due in part to the couple's difference in ages and weights—Endara was in his mid-fifties and known for his weight—the marriage received widespread coverage and mockery in the Panamanian press, including a new nickname for Endara, "El Gordo Feliz" ("Happy Fatty").
In 1992, Diaz won $125,000 in the national lottery and indicated that she intended to keep the money rather than donating it; the incident was cited as an example of the Endara's administration's lack of concern for the poor. In 1994, she was accused of reselling food that had been donated by Italy on the streets of Panama City, one of a number of financial scandals to strike the administration.
Endara ran for president again in 2004 and in 2009, placing second and a distant third, respectively. On September 28, 2009, he died at age 73 at his home in Panama City, of a heart attack.
