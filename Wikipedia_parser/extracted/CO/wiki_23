Empress Yan Ji

Empress Yan Ji (閻姬) (died 126), formally Empress Ansi (安思皇后, literally "the peaceful and deep-thinking empress"), was an empress during Han Dynasty. Her husband was Emperor An. She was known for her conspiratorial and nepotistic behavior, both as empress and (briefly) as empress dowager. However, her plan, along with her brothers, to hold onto power for a long time ultimately resulted in failure and the deaths of her clan members.
Family background and marriage to Emperor An.
Yan Ji's father Yan Chang (閻暢) was the son of Yan Zhang (閻章), an official under Emperor Ming whose two sisters were imperial consorts, and who was described as a capable official whose promotion however was halted by Emperor Ming, who did not want to appear nepotistic.
When Ji was young, she was described as intelligent and beautiful, and in 107, she was selected as an imperial consort for Emperor An, who was 13, and she quickly became his favorite. In 108, he created her empress—even though she was also described as jealous, to the extent that that year, she poisoned Consort Li, who had given birth to a son of the emperor, Liu Bao (劉保).
As empress.
During most of Emperor An's reign, he was mostly overshadowed by his regent, Empress Dowager Deng Sui, but after Empress Dowager Deng died in 121, he asserted his authority and put a number of his trusted individuals in power to displace the late empress dowager's family, many of whom were forced to commit suicide. Among these entrusted individuals were Empress Yan's brothers Yan Xian (閻顯), Yan Jing (閻景), Yan Yao (閻耀), and Yan Yan (閻晏), particularly Xian. Empress Yan herself influenced her husband in his actions greatly, much to the detriment of the empire. In 124, she falsely accused nine-year-old Prince Bao, who had been made crown prince because he was Emperor An's only son, of crimes, and Emperor An deposed Prince Bao and created him Prince of Jiyin.
As empress dowager.
In 125, Emperor An died suddenly while on a trip to Wancheng (宛城, in modern Nanyang, Henan). The empress, who was with him, did not immediately announce his death, but conspired with her brothers and the powerful eunuchs Jiang Jing (江京) and Fan Feng (樊豐), to find an alternative to Prince Bao, who would otherwise appear to be his father's natural successor. They chose a young cousin of Emperor An's, Liu Yi (劉懿) the Marquess of Beixiang, and Marquess Yi was made emperor over Prince Bao. (They had made this decision because the Marquess of Beixiang was young and easy to control.)
The Yans, working with Jiang, quickly moved to grab more power. They falsely accused some other of Emperor An's trusted individuals—including his stepuncle Geng Bao (耿寶), his wet nurse Wang Sheng (王聖), and the eunuch Fan of crimes. Fan was executed, while Geng and Wang were exiled with their families. The Yans were firmly in power—or so they thought. A major illness to the young emperor would foil their plans.
The eunuch Sun Cheng (孫程), believing that Prince Bao was the proper emperor and knowing that the young emperor was ill, formed a conspiracy with Prince Bao's assistant Changxing Qu (長興渠) and a number of other eunuchs with intent to restore Prince Bao. When, late in the year, the young emperor died, Empress Yan and her brothers again did not announce his death but sommoned the sons of the imperial princes to the capital, intending to again bypass Prince Bao. Several days later, Sun and 18 of his fellow eunuchs made a surprise attack on the palace, killing Jiang and several eunuchs in his party and forcing his colleague Li Run (李閏) to lead their coup d'état. They welcomed Prince Bao to the palace and declared him emperor (as Emperor Shun). For several days, the eunuchs' forces battled with the empress dowager's forces, finally defeating the empress dowager and her brothers. The Yan clan was slaughtered, while Empress Dowager Yan was confined to her palace.
Some officials advised Emperor Shun to depose Empress Dowager Yan from her title of empress dowager. After some consideration, Emperor Shun declined such action and continued to treat her with the honors due an empress dowager. However, perhaps in fear and in mourning for her family, she died in early 126 and was buried with her husband Emperor An.

Richard Roth (journalist)

Richard Roth (born 1955) is an American journalist, a CNN correspondent who covers the United Nations and was the host of "Diplomatic License" (until its cancellation in January 2006), a weekly program that was devoted to United Nations affairs. Roth is a CNN "original" — one of the first employees when the network launched in 1980. He has covered a wide range of stories over the last 25 years, from the 1989 Beijing student uprising in Tiananmen Square to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the first Gulf War. Before CNN, he was an anchor and reporter for AP Radio and a producer for WPIX-TV in New York. Roth graduated from New York University with a degree in journalism.
Roth lived in Whitestone, Queens, in the early 1970s. He is a devotee of Alfred Hitchcock's "North by Northwest"; he is alleged to have revisited the various locations shown in the film, e.g., Mount Rushmore and Cary Grant's famous cornfield sequence. He is not to be confused with Richard Roth of CBS News.
In popular culture.
Richard Roth appeared in Robert Wiener’s book "Live from Baghdad". He appeared as a character in the 2002 HBO film of the same name where he was portrayed by actor Hamish Linklater.
The book as well as the film features Roth’s brief involvement with Wiener’s crew in Baghdad which was caused by sudden withdrawal of his fellow reporter colleague Tom Murphy on safety issues. Roth was stationed in Amman before joining Wiener and left the crew shortly before the Gulf War began, but within this time became part of an important coverage where the CNN team stepped into a messy US diplomatic mission in Baghdad and he interviewed a stranded US expatriate worker Robert Vinton. Roth’s interview of Vinton saw widespread coverage in the US and caused subsequent disappearance of Bob Vinton by the Iraqi authorities, though he was finally released and allowed to leave Iraq for home.

BM-27 Uragan

The BM-27 Uragan (, 'hurricane'; GRAU index 9P140) is a self-propelled multiple rocket launcher system designed in the Soviet Union. It began its service with the Soviet Army in the late 1970s, as its first modern spin and fin stabilized heavy multiple rocket launcher. 
Description.
The BM-27 Uragan is capable of launching 220 mm rockets from 16 launch tubes mounted on the rear of a ZIL-135 8x8 chassis. This vehicle is extremely similar to that used in the FROG-7 free flight rocket system. It has 2 gasoline engines that power its 20 tonnes to a maximum speed of 65 kilometers per hour. One engine drives the 4 wheels on the left of the truck while the other engine drives the 4 wheels on the right. The ZIL-135 has 8 wheel drive, but only the front and rear axles are used for steering. It has a maximum cruising range of 500 kilometers.
The cab of the ZIL-135 is NBC protected, allowing the rockets to be fired without exposing the crew to possible contaminants. The crew of 4 can emplace or displace the system in 3 minutes. 
Before firing, stabilizing jacks must be lowered and the blast shield raised to protect the cab and its occupants. Indirect fire aiming is achieved with the use of a PG-1 panoramic telescope. Although there are no night vision sights, the driver of the launch vehicle is equipped with a night vision device. 
The BM-27 can use HE-FRAG, chemical, ICM or scatterable mine PTM-3 or PFM-1) submunition equipped rockets all of which are detonated by electric timing fuses. Each rocket weighs 280.4 kilograms. The warheads weigh between 90 and 100 kilograms depending on type. A full salvo of 16 rockets can be fired in 20 seconds and can engage targets within a range of 35 kilometers.
Because of the size of the warhead, the range of the rocket and the speed that a salvo can be delivered, the BM-27 is very effective at mine laying. Each 220 mm rocket can scatter 312 anti-personnel PFM-1 mines. Minefields can be laid behind a retreating enemy or even be used to trap an enemy by encircling them with mines. Tactics such as this were often used by the Soviets in Afghanistan. 
Once the rockets have been fired, 9T452 (another ZIL-135 based vehicle) is used to assist in reloading. It carries additional rockets and a crane to transfer the rockets from the reload vehicle to the launcher. The entire reloading procedure takes around 20 minutes. 
Variants.
the Ukraine produces the BM-27 on a KrAZ 6x6 truck chassis.

Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait)

The Wisam Al-Tahrir () (Liberation Medal) was issued by the government of Kuwait for service during the Liberation of Kuwait campaign.
Description.
The Kuwait Liberation Medal was approved by the Kuwait Council of Ministers for award in five classes, generally according to the rank of the recipient. The medal was offered by the Chief of Staff of the Kuwait Armed Forces on July 16, 1994.
A nation of seafarers and ship builders, Kuwait chose as their coat of arms, the traditional dhow. Falconry is the sport of Kings in the Persian Gulf, and the falcon in the arms is seen as a symbol of Kuwaiti prowess. The official symbolism of the colors is that black symbolizes battlefields, white is for deeds, green is for the meadows, and red is for the blood of Kuwait's enemies.
Australia.
The Australian Government has decreed that Australian personnel may accept their medals as a keepsake, but permission to wear them in uniform has so far been refused. This because the Liberation Of Kuwait Medal (Saudi Arabia)was approved to wear in uniform some time prior to the Kuwait issued medal being issued.
Canada.
The Canadian Government has decreed that Canadian personnel may accept their medals as a keepsake, but permission to wear them in uniform has so far been refused.
France.
France accepted all grades version for their personnel according to their rank at the time of operation desert storm, permission to wear them in uniform has been granted.
United Kingdom.
HM Government has decreed that British personnel may accept their medals as a keepsake but permission to wear the medal or ribbon is strictly forbidden.
United States.
The US accepted only the fifth grade version for all personnel.
Criteria: Awarded to members of the Military Coalition who served in support of Operation Desert Shield or Desert Storm in one or more of the following areas between 2 August 1990 and 31 August 1993: Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, Gulf of Aden, that portion of the Arabian Sea that lies north of 10 degrees north latitude and west of 68 degrees east longitude, as well as the total land areas of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. To be eligible, a service member must have been:
The Government of Kuwait offered the Kuwait Liberation Medal to members of the Armed Forces of the United States by letter dated 16 July 1994. The medal was accepted by Secretary of Defense William J. Perry per memorandum dated 16 March 1995.
The Kuwait version of the Kuwait Liberation Medal is considered junior in precedence to the Saudi Arabian version of the medal.

Paddock (war rooms)

Paddock is the codeword for an alternative Cabinet War Room bunker for Winston Churchill's World War II government located in Brook Road, Dollis Hill, northwest London under the Post Office Research Station. It was constructed in 1939 but only rarely used during the war, with only two meetings of the War Cabinet being held there. It was abandoned in 1944.
Paddock has had various, intermittent uses since (including a brief period where what is thought to be the map room was used as a Post Office staff social club) but otherwise the site remains largely disused and empty as it was when it was decommissioned at the end of World War II. 
The bunker is owned by the housing association responsible for the homes now occupying part of the former research station site above, and is open to the public two or three times a year, with guided tours provided by volunteers from the Subterranea Britannica organisation - see below.

Marinism

Marinism (Italian marinismo, or secentismo, "17th century") is the name now given to an ornate, witty style of poetry and verse drama written in imitation of Giambattista Marino (1569-1625), following in particular "La Lira" and "L'Adone".
Features.
The critic James V. Mirollo, the author of the first monograph in English on the subject, distinguished the terms as follows:
The following discussion is based on Mirollo's analysis.
Similitude and metaphor.
The Marinist poet never hesitated to embark on a long string of comparisons with nature, most of them couched as metaphor rather than simile because this allowed for more striking statements. "There was hardly an area of human experience that could not be pressed into service for a comparison." Nevertheless, Marino leans heavily on both classical mythology and Christian imagery, adapting it freely to create a huge number of memorable word-pictures: "gems, minerals, and precious metals [...] flowers (especially the rose and the lily), birds, fire, snow, the seasons, the sea, and, above all, sun and stars [...] milk, ivory, parturition, the arts and sciences, and a variety of actions and emotions useful for personification."

Tretyakovskaya (Moscow Metro)

Tretyakovskaya () is a cross-platform Moscow Metro station in the , , Moscow. It is on Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya and Kalininskaya lines.
The southern hall of Tretyakovskaya opened on 3 January 1971. It is named after the nearby State Tretyakov Gallery. Unlike Kitay-gorod which was purpose-built as a cross-platform interchange station, Tretyakovskaya operated normally station before the connection with Kalininskaya Line in 1986. At that time a second platform was opened forming a cross-platform interchange.
Designed by V. Polikarpova and A. Marova, Tretyakosvskaya has blocky pylons faced with white Koyelga marble and joined by a continuous marble cornice. All Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line trains stopped at this station until 1986, when the new northern platform opened. Currently the older (southern) platform is served by northbound trains terminating at Medvedkovo and Novogireyevo.
The southbound (northern) platform, served by trains terminating at Tretyakovskaya and Novoyasenevskaya, was designed by R. Pogrebnoy and V. Filippov. It features curved white marble separated by translucent panels which conceal fluorescent light fixtures. The walls are faced with red marble and decorated with a series of plaques by Alexander Bourganov depicting great Russian painters.
The two platforms are joined by a passage located midway along their length and also by the shared vestibule, which opens onto Klimentovsky Lane.
Transfers.

Affine involution

In Euclidean geometry, of special interest are involutions which are linear or affine transformations over the Euclidean space R"n". Such involutions are easy to characterize and they can be described geometrically.
Linear involutions.
To give a linear involution is the same as giving an involutory matrix, a square matrix "A" such that
where "I" is the identity matrix.
It is a quick check that a square matrix "D" that has zero off the main diagonal and ±1 on the diagonal, that is, a signature matrix of the form
satisfies (1), i.e. is the matrix of a linear involution. It turns out that all the matrices satisfying (1) are of the form 
where "U" is invertible and "D" is as above. That is to say, the matrix of any linear involution is of the form "D" up to a matrix similarity. Geometrically this means that any linear involution can be obtained by taking oblique reflections against any number from 0 through "n" hyperplanes going through the origin. (The term "oblique reflection" as used here includes ordinary reflections.)
One can easily verify that "A" represents a linear involution if and only if "A" has the form
for a linear projection "P".
Affine involutions.
If "A" represents a linear involution, then "x"→"A"("x"−"b")+"b" is an affine involution. One can check that any affine involution in fact has this form. Geometrically this means that any affine involution can be obtained by taking oblique reflections against any number from 0 through "n" hyperplanes going through a point "b". 
Affine involutions can be categorized by the dimension of the affine space of fixed points; this corresponds to the number of values 1 on the diagonal of the similar matrix "D" (see above), i.e., the dimension of the eigenspace for eigenvalue 1.
The affine involutions in 3D are:
Isometric involutions.
In the case that the eigenspace for eigenvalue 1 is the orthogonal complement of that for eigenvalue −1, i.e., every eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 is orthogonal to every eigenvector with eigenvalue −1, such an affine involution is an isometry. The two extreme cases for which this always applies are the identity function and inversion in a point.
The other involutive isometries are inversion in a line (in 2D, 3D, and up; this is in 2D a reflection, and in 3D a rotation about the line by 180°), inversion in a plane (in 3D and up; in 3D this is a reflection in a plane), inversion in a 3D space (in 3D: the identity), etc.

Stuart Thayer

Stuart LeRoy Thayer (March 27, 1926 - June 24, 2009) was a historian of American circuses. 
Biography.
He was born on March 27, 1926 in Ann Arbor, Michigan to Louise and Lyle O. Thayer (1901-1968). Thayer served in World War II after which he graduated with a degree in literature from the University of Michigan. He operated an insurance agency in Ann Arbor until his late 40s, when he retired to devote the remainder of his life to documenting the history of the American circus. He began writing articles on circus history in "Bandwagon", the journal of the Circus Historical Society, in the late 1960s, one a piece on Ringling cages co-authored by Richard Conover, then the leading student of American field shows. 
His first major work was "Mudshows and Railers", an account of the 1879 circus season based mainly on a close reading of the "New York Clipper", the industry's trade paper, and metropolitan dailies. The first of his three groundbreaking books on the history of the American Circus before 1860, "Annals of the American Circus", came out in 1976. It was the first extensively researched, comprehensive account of the ante-bellum American circus, obsoleting virtually all previous secondary work on the subject. He later co-authored books with fellow historians Fred Dahlinger and William L. Slout, and continued to publish in "Bandwagon". "Traveling Showmen", his masterpiece, was published in 1997. The distillation of his thirty years of research, the book analyzed the economic and operational aspects of pre-Civil War circuses. A companion volume on the performance and performers appeared in 2006. At the time of his death, he was finishing a biography of Adam Forepaugh, the late 19th century circus manager. 
Thayer died in Seattle, Washington on June 24, 2009. He was survived by his wife Boyka, son Preston, stepdaughter Katherine Davis, stepson Jon Davis, and grandchildren Amin, Nilofar, Aydan, and Thayer.

Aerial dance

Aerial modern dance is a sub-genre of modern dance first recognized in the United States in the 1970s. The choreography incorporates an apparatus often attached to the ceiling, allowing performers to explore space in three-dimensions. The ability to incorporate vertical, as well as horizontal movement paths, allows for innovations in choreography and movement vocabulary.
Overview.
Aerial modern pieces, whether solo or ensemble, often involve partnering. The apparatus used has its own motion, which changes the way a dancer must move in response. The introduction of a new element changes the dancer’s balance, center, and orientation in space. Aerial modern dancers gather annually for workshops in places like Boulder, Colorado, Co Donegal, Ireland and Bretagne, France, Italy.
In Boulder Colorado, Frequent Flyers Productions' produces the Aerial Dance Festival – the first of its kind – (the "Aerial Dance Festival") and has been held every year since its inception in July 1999. Here, workshops, performances, and discussions bring together dancers, gymnasts, circus artists, and other aerial enthusiasts to showcase their own works and learn about new developments in technique and technology.
In Bretagne, France, the festival is called Ls Rencontres Dans Aeriennes (LRDA, or "Aerial Dance Encounters") and was originally founded in 2008 by Fred Deb.
The Irish Aerial Dance Festival is organised by Fidget Feet, an aerial dance theatre company based in Ireland, run by artistic directors Chantal McCormick and Jym Daly. It is run every year in Letterkenny, County Donegal, Ireland.
Lindsey Butcher of Gravity & Levity, based in Brighton, England, runs the European Aerial Dance Festival in Brighton, England every summer.
Fred Deb was one of the forerunners of aerial dance using fabric in France. Deb started her company Drapés Aériens in 2001, Fred Deb’ has choreographed and conceived many works in collaboration with Jacques Bertrand. Originally a dancer by training, Jacques is her assistant, partner, and technical director.
Another early influence on aerial modern dance, Terry Sendgraff, is credited with inventing the "motivity" trapeze. Terry Sendgraff actively performed, choreographed and taught in the San Francisco Bay Area from the early 1970s until announcing her retirement in 2005, at the age of 70. The motivity trapeze came about as a result of an exploration on a low-hung circus trapeze. The ropes twisted together, causing the apparatus to spin. By formalizing this, hooking both ropes to a single point of attachment, Ms. Sendgraff used the apparatus to spin, twist, as well as fly in a straight line and in a circle.
In Italy, an emergent aerial Dance company (Cafelulé), brought the contemporary dance discipline in a vertical stage. The performance of the Company distinguish from others by the details of the coreography and the armony of the movement, typical elements of the classic dance.
Aerial dance is an art form that is incredibly demanding and requires a high degree of strength, power, flexibility, courage, and grace to practice.
The first and only book detailing the history of aerial dance was published in 1988 by Human Kinetics: Jayne C. Bernasconi and Nancy E. Smith "Aerial Dance".
Site dance.
Another example of aerial modern dance are the site-specific works of Joanna Haigood of the Zaccho Dance Theatre, Amelia Rudolph of "Project Bandaloop," and Sally Jacques' Blue Lapis Light Haigood’s work is based on careful research of the history, architecture and societal impact of found spaces, and the translation of these memories into the movements performed in that space. Project Bandaloop combines rock-climbing with dance in performances that scale and/or descend canyons, rock walls, and tall buildings across the world. Video of their outdoor work is sometimes integrated into indoor performances, projected onto screens or trampolines behind the dancers on stage. Blue Lapis Light uses multiple apparatuses, such as aerial silks, harnesses, and bungees to create dances on bridges, office buildings, hotels, and other outdoor spaces.
Amateur dancers.
There is an ever growing community of non professional aerial dancers, many who take class and attend workshops at aerial dance festivals, with professional companies or at individual schools and training places.

<doc id="2858827" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2858827" title="Jean-Baptiste Labat">
Jean-Baptiste Labat

Jean-Baptiste Labat (sometimes called, simply, Père Labat) (1663 – 6 January 1738) was a French clergyman, botanist, writer, explorer, ethnographer, soldier, engineer, and landowner.
Life.
Labat was born and died in Paris. He entered the order of the Dominicans at the age of twenty. He was ordained at the completion of his philosophical and theological studies. Besides preaching, he taught philosophy and mathematics to secular students at Nancy. Abandoning this work, he devoted himself to missionary activity and for many years preached in the various churches of France.
In 1693, determined to devote himself to foreign missionary work, he received permission from the general of his order to travel to the West Indies, then under French domination. On 29 January 1694, he landed in Martinique. He was entrusted with the parish of Macouba (Macumba), where he labored for two years and added many new buildings, including the church.
In 1696 he travelled to Guadeloupe, and was appointed procurator-general of all the Dominican convents in the Antilles ("Procureur syndic des îles d'Amérique") upon his return to Martinique.
The French government appointed him as an engineer due to his scientific knowledge. In this capacity, he visited the French, Dutch, and English Antilles from Grenada to Hispaniola. Labat encountered many aspects of Caribbean society, including slavery. In his account for the year 1698, Labat included his impressions regarding the slaves of Martinique: "The dance is their favourite passion. I don't think that there is a people on the face of the earth who are more attached to it than they. When the Master will not allow them to dance on the Estate, they will travel three and four leagues, as soon as they knock off work at the sugar-works on Saturday, and betake themselves to some place where they know that there will be a dance."
Labat was no simple observer or opponent to slavery, however. As proprietor of the estate of Fonds-Saint-Jacques (in the north, alongside a river of the same name) and founder of the parish of François, both on Martinique, Labat applied himself to modernizing and developing the sugar industry on this island, and owned -and brutalized- his own slaves. Fonds-Saint-Jacques was for a long time regarded as a model to be copied. On Martinique, Labat's memory has survived in the vocabulary: "La Tour du père Labat" ("windmill"); "les chaudières Père Labat" (the Père Labat boilers"), or the standard of distillation known as "type Père Labat".
As engineer in Guadeloupe, he took an active part in its defense when the British attacked the island in 1704. Labat fired several cannon with his own hand. He was appointed "Vice-Préfet Apostolique" in the same year.
In 1706, Labat was sent to Europe as deputy of his order. He spent several years in Italy and attended a meeting of the order at Bologna, and presenting to the general a report of his work. Labat prepared to return to America, but was denied permission and detained in Rome for several years. He traveled to Paris in 1716. He lived in the convent on Rue Saint-Honore until his death. During these years, Labat commenced a long contemplated history of the West Indies. The work was finally published in six volumes at Paris, in 1722, with copious illustrations made by himself ("Nouveau Voyage aux isles Françoises de l'Amérique", Paris, 1722).
Legacy.
The genus of the tropical fruit tree family Sapotaceae Labatia, first described in 1788, was named after Labat. It was maintained as a distinct entity until the 1930s when it was submerged in the genus "Pouteria". In 1972, it was proposed that a new genus called Neolabatia be recognized, containing six species formerly known as Labatia, but this classification is disputed.

In Spite of All the Danger

"In Spite of All the Danger" is one of the first songs recorded by the Quarrymen, then composed of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, pianist John Lowe and drummer Colin Hanton.
The song was written by McCartney and Harrison and is the only song to credit the two alone. It is believed to have been recorded on Saturday 12 July 1958 (three days before Lennon's mother's death). However, that recording date is disputed by the group. The recording was made at Percy Phillips' home studio in Liverpool (see 1958 in music), and cost 17 shillings and six pence (87.5p).
Composition.
Along with their cover of Buddy Holly's "That'll Be the Day" recorded at the same session, these songs were the first recordings made by what would become the Beatles. The only other previous recording of the Quarrymen in performance was a reel-to-reel tape-recording made by an audience member on 6 July 1957, during the Quarrymen's last set for the 1957 "Rose Queen garden fête" at St. Peter's Church, Woolton, Liverpool. This was made on the very day on which McCartney first met Lennon, but before he was a member of the group. So, while it is true that an audience member made a recording that night, the recording was not under the band's control, and it was made before McCartney or Harrison joined the band.
McCartney has claimed he wrote the song. "'In Spite Of All The Danger' was actually written by me and George played the guitar solo! We were mates and nobody was into copyrights and publishing, nobody understood — we actually used to think when we came down to London that songs belonged to everyone... I remember we all went down on the bus with our instruments – amps and guitars – and the drummer went separately. We waited in the little waiting room outside while somebody else made their demo and then it was our turn. We just went into the room, hardly saw the fella because he was next door in a little control booth. "OK, what are you going to do?" We ran through it very quickly, quarter of an hour, and it was all over. I think we paid £5 for that. It was me, John, George, Colin Hanton on drums and Duff Lowe, five of us ... I sang the lead, I think so anyway. It was my song. It's very similar to an Elvis song. It's me doing an Elvis ... I'm a bit loath to say which! ... It was one that I'd heard at scout camp when I was younger and I'd loved it."
Most commentators conclude that the Presley song used by McCartney as a model was "Tryin' to Get to You", which was included in Elvis's first UK album, back in 1956. Chris Ingram says it was "clearly inspired" by it, and John C. Winn says it was "fashioned after" it. However, the fact McCartney himself is not entirely sure as to which Elvis song influenced him may be simply that it was not just one Elvis song, but actually two of his songs which influenced him, the second being the last track on Elvis' 1957 Christmas Album, which hit UK stores by early December, a gospel song entitled "It is no secret". Twice during that recording, after the first and second verse, the Jordainaires, who backed Presley starting in 1956, perform a chorus which is very similar to the various choruses one hears "In spite of all the danger". That particular chorus is not heard in any of the original versions of the same song, by other artists, so if in fact McCartney wanted to recreate the Elvis song he'd heard and loved while at scout camp, years earlier, it was after listening to both songs, the second a few months before recording "In spite of all the danger", that did the job, inadvertent as it may have been, in the latter case.
Musical structure.
The Song is in the key of E and follows a standard I (E chord)-I7-IV (A chord)-V7 (B7 chord)-I-IV-I progression. Here the harmonic development initially arises with the move (in bar 5 on "I'll do anything for "you"") to a subdominant or IV (A chord built on the 4th degree of the E major scale), but without the intervening range of chords prolonging harmonic tension that so characterised later Beatles songwriting. The resolution back to the tonic comes as the V chord (B7 in bar 8 on "you want me "to"") shifts to the I (E chord on "true to "me"").
History of the recording.
Only one copy of the "That'll Be the Day" and "In Spite of All the Danger" recordings was made, and each band member kept the acetate disc for a week. Lowe was the last to have it, keeping it for nearly 25 years. In 1981, Lowe attempted to sell it at auction, but McCartney intervened and purchased it from him. McCartney had engineers restore as much of the record's sound quality as possible and then made approximately 50 copies of the single that he gave as personal gifts to family and friends. In 2004, "Record Collector" magazine named the original pressing as the most valuable record in existence, estimating its worth at £100,000, with the 1981 copies made by McCartney coming in second on the list at £10,000 each.
Public release.
"In Spite of All the Danger" was not released to the public until it appeared on 1995's "Anthology 1" collection (see 1995 in music) along with "That'll Be the Day". The "Anthology" version (2:44) runs a little shorter than the unedited original (3:25).
McCartney played the song throughout his 2005 world tour (see 2005 in music).
The song's recording was depicted by "The Nowhere Boys" in the 2009 biopic "Nowhere Boy" which was accurate even to the 17/6d charge for the recording session. The band also perform "That'll Be The Day," although this was cut out of the film and is now available as a deleted scene on the DVD and Blu-Ray releases. These versions of the two songs can be heard on the film's soundtrack.

Penteli, Greece

Penteli () is a town and a municipality in the North Athens regional unit, Attica, Greece. It belongs to the Athens metropolitan area. It takes its name from the Penteli mountain.
Municipality.
The municipality Penteli was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 3 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
Geography.
Penteli is situated on the southern slopes of the limestone Penteli mountains. It is 14 km northeast of central Athens. Some of the neighbourhoods of Penteli are Agia Triada, Agios Dimitrios, Daou and Kallithea.
History.
The bones of prehistoric animals - mastodons, rhinoceros, antelope, and giraffe, along with giant turtles, hyenas and other animals no longer extant in the area - have been found among the limestone crags of the mountain that looms over the present suburb of Athens. The Penteli mountains were renowned in Classical Greece as well as in the Roman Empire as a source of the marble, which was also used to build the Parthenon. The Romans constructed a 140-foot water tower and aqueduct to supply water to the city of Athens.
During the Greek War of Independence, the French philhellene Sophie de Marbois-Lebrun, Duchess of Plaisance supported the revolutionary leaders. When she settled in Greece in 1834, she bought large plots of land in Athens and on the Penteli mountain. She had the Rododafni Castle in Penteli built for her.
In July 1995, Penteli was ravaged by a large forest fire. According to Turkish former prime minister, Mesut Yilmaz, many of the forest fires that raged the Greek countryside during that summer were accually started by Turkish secret service agents. The forests of Penteli suffered damage again from the August 2007 fires.

Ufuk Talay

Ufuk Talay (born 26 March 1976 in Sydney, Australia) is an Australian footballer who plays for Sydney United FC. Talay is suited to play in central midfield and is known for his good distribution and on-field vision.
Club career.
Talay first entered a national competition for Marconi-Fairfield in the now defunct NSL, as first an understudy to Steve Corica and later as a midfield partner. He made his debut late in the 92/93 season, playing the last six regular season games and scoring in the final round. Marconi went on to win the grand final with seventeen-year-old Talay watching as an unused substitute. Talay remained with Marconi for a further two years, becoming a regular starter in the first team.
Turkey.
Seeking a more promising career to build on his NSL and national team experience, Talay joined Turkish giants Galatasaray in the Turkish Premier Super League. He spent time on loan out to other sides in the Turkish top flight and lower divisions with Antalyaspor, Karabükspor and Bursaspor, followed by a brief six-month stint in the French second division with Nîmes Olympique, before Galatasaray transferred him to Gaziantepspor in 2002. He shortly moved again to second division side Mersin Idman Yurdu, before being enticed to return to Australia with Sydney FC in the new A-League competition.
Sydney FC.
As the sixteenth player signed to the inaugural Sydney FC squad, Talay sought to reignite his football career and at Sydney was reunited with former Marconi teammates Corica and Matthew Bingley, as well as Clint Bolton and Robbie Middleby whom shared the experience of the Youth World Cup. He has been described by Socceroo Josip Skoko as "the best player to never represent Australia", and Talay has expressed his desire for a full international cap. A motivation for his return to Australia is "the chance to get back in the spotlight and get that Aussie shirt". 
His first season was cut short by a knee injury, missing the last seven games (including the grand final) after solid performances in the A-League and Club World Cup. As the 2006/07 season started, Talay found himself on the outer as new coach Terry Butcher favoured a central pairing of Terry McFlynn and Mark Milligan. His early appearances of the season were as a late substitute, before other injuries opened the opportunity to win back a first team place, which he held for the remainder of the year. He also took over penalty-duties for the side, making the most of the opportunity twice in the year. Two yellow cards in the final league match saw Talay suspended for Sydney's first leg final against Newcastle but on return for the second leg he could not prevent the club's elimination.
Following the close of the A-League season, Sydney proceeded on to the AFC Champions League 2007 competition. Talay played all six group-stage games, scoring goals against Shanghai Shenhua and Urawa. In the return match against Shanghai Shenhua, he sensationally hit the crossbar from the penalty spot, Sydney eventually drawing the match 0–0.'
Talay remains with Sydney for the 2007/08 season, continuing into the final season of his original three-year contract, playing every game of the season except one (due to suspension after receiving a fourth yellow card for the year the previous match). In December 2007, it was announced that he would follow former Sydney FC teammate Mark Rudan to Japan, signing with second division side Avispa Fukuoka, the move completed in February at the close of Sydney's season.
Avispa Fukuoka.
Talay Joined fellow Australians Mark Rudan and Newcastle's Joel Griffiths becoming the third Australian in their squad. He was an immediate success, scoring twice in three games, and netting a third in his fifth game.
North Queensland Fury FC.
Talay returned to Australia in 2009 after signing a two-year deal with newly established A-League franchise North Queensland Fury FC, after expressing interest in returning home to his family. He played in their inaugural year, the A-League 2009-10 season and the following season. Talay was recommended as captain by former teammate Robbie Middleby.
Sydney United.
Despite announcing his retirement once North Queensland Fury folded, It was announced on 12 March 2011 that Talay had signed for NSW Premier League club Sydney United.
International career.
His first national level selection was for the Young Socceroos in 1994. He joined the squad in a number of Youth World Cup qualifiers and retained his place for the 1995 Youth World Cup in New Zealand.
In January 2008, he was named by coach Pim Verbeek in a 22-man Socceroos training camp squad, made up entirely of A-League players, in preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup third round qualifiers in Sydney. But his performances at the camp did not see him through to making his national team debut, being snubbed out of the final 39-man squad for the qualifiers.

Tracy Shaw

Tracy Shaw (born 27 July 1973, Belper, Derbyshire) is a British actress and singer.
She is best known for her role as hairdresser Maxine Peacock in British soap opera "Coronation Street" during the 1990s and early 2000s.
Career.
Shaw was born into the hotel and pub trade, at the time when her parents ran the Talbot Hotel in Belper, Derbyshire. She attended St. Benedict's School in Derbyshire, learnt classical dance at Hilda Davis School of Dance, Belper and went to the Arden School of Theatre in Manchester in 1990, where she got a degree in theatre studies.
Her best known work at present is hairdresser Maxine Peacock in the long-running, popular British soap opera "Coronation Street" which is set and filmed in Manchester. However, Shaw came into conflict with the show's bosses after they reportedly tried to cut her pay by £20,000 a year and she bowed out from her famous role as a result. Shaws's character met a tragic and unfortunate end in the episode screened on 13 January 2003, when she was murdered by Richard Hillman (played by Brian Capron).
She has also appeared in numerous ITV dramas. In 2003 Shaw appeared as Sally in the stage play "The Blue Room", starring alongside Jason Connery. 
Since the birth of her children Tracy has returned to acting and has performed in several National Stage Tours, more recently Mum's the Word (2010) and Busy Body (2011), as well as the lead role in pantomimes in Worthing and Southsea.
She also had a short lived pop career in 1998, releasing two singles on the Love This Records label, "Ridin' High" and a cover of Lonnie Gordon's top 10 hit, "Happenin' All Over Again".
Personal life.
In May 1996 she was presented with the Rear of the Year, title. She had a series of high-profile romances, including engagement to Darren Day, which led to an array of media stories of cocaine addiction which were ultimately proven to be false though Shaw admitted to having used the drug.
She married Robert Ashworth in June 2001, but a series of early problems occurred including a row on a return flight from the Caribbean after she had been filming ITV1's "Wish You Were Here...?". In 2003, her father Karl Shaw was featured in an article in the "News of the World", and said that Shaw survived on "three bottles of wine and a packet of crisps a day". He also said that if "she carries on this way it will kill her". She made moves to turn her life around including spending two months in rehab in the United States and leaving her husband. Before this she had set up an eating disorder charity called 'The Tracy Shaw Foundation' which helps teenagers combat eating disorders, as she had struggled with anorexia during the 1990s, and at one stage her weight plunged below six stone.
Her marriage ended in divorce in 2004, and Shaw set up home with and subsequently became engaged to childhood friend and Cisco Sales Manager Ashley Poundall, the son of her mother Anne's boyfriend of eight years, Colin. The couple currently live in Caversham, Berkshire and have two sons Louis (born February 2005) and Luca (born September 2006).. Tracy's maternal grandfather Edward Duffy hailed from Coatbridge in Scotland and she still has a number of family members living in the area.
Stalker.
In 2000, alleged stalker Kevin Sedgwick pleaded guilty to harassing Shaw over a period of five years. He had written a number of letters to her, as well as Coronation Street co-stars Jacqueline Pirie and Jennifer James, and hung around the grounds of Granada Studios in Manchester, put his arms around Miss Shaw, and asked for a kiss. Sedgwick pleaded guilty later that year to multiple acts of gross indecency with children and had suffered from hearing voices in his head.

Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia)

The Naut Tahrir al-Kuwait () (Medal for the Liberation of Kuwait) was instituted by King Fahd ibn Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia for service during the Liberation of Kuwait campaign.
Background.
The Saudi Arabian version of the Kuwait Liberation Medal is awarded to members of the Coalition Forces who participated in Operation Desert Storm and the liberation of Kuwait between the dates of January 17, 1991 and February 28, 1991. 
It is considered rarer than the Kuwaiti version of the medal, because it recognizes service in a relatively short period of time (only a few weeks) whereas the Kuwaiti version of the medal is granted for service over several years. The Saudi version is also senior in precedence, owing to its having been authorized for several years before the Kuwaiti version was offered.
Description.
The Saudi version of the Kuwait Liberation Medal consists of a silver star of fifteen rounded points (with shorter rounded points between them) surmounted by a gilt medallion which contains a wreath tied at its based and a crown at its top. In the center of the gilt medallion is a silver representation of the Earth, over which is superimposed a gilt representation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Above the gilt medallion are the crossed swords and palm tree taken from the Royal Cypher. Beneath the gilt medallion is a swallow-tailed scroll with its ends folded back and point upward so they follow the contour of the gilt medallion. On the scroll are the words, LIBERATION OF KUWAIT in English, and the same inscription above it in Arabic. 
The ribbon bar to the medal bears a gilt device consisting of crossed swords (point up) superimposed over a palm tree. This device is taken from the Royal Cypher. The device is not used on the suspension ribbon to the actual medal.
Australia.
The Australian Government has authorised the medal to be worn with other international honours and awards after all other Australian medals.
Belgium.
Belgium has authorised the medal to be worn on military uniform with other international honours and awards after all Belgian medals.
Canada.
The Canadian Government has decreed that the Canadian personnel may accept their medals as a keepsake but permission to wear them in uniform has so far been refused.
France.
France accepted the medal for their personnel; permission to wear them in uniform has been granted.
United Kingdom.
British servicemen have not been given permission by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to wear this medal. The wearing of the medal or the ribbon is strictly forbidden. It is accepted only as a keepsake.
United States.
Service must have been performed in support of Operation Desert Storm and the liberation of Kuwait, between 17 January 1991 to 28 February 1991. Eligible areas include:

Jean Rosenthal

Jean Rosenthal (born Eugenia Rosenthal March 16, 1912 - May 1, 1969) is considered a pioneer in the field of theatrical lighting design. She was born in New York City to Romanian-Jewish immigrants.
In the early part of the 20th century, the lighting designer was not a formalized position. Rather the set designer or electrician handled the lighting of a production. Rosenthal helped make the lighting designer an integral member of the design team. She also said that lighting "was a career in itself". As well as particular lighting innovations, she created an atmosphere specific to the production, and she was in demand as a Broadway lighting designer.
In 1929, she was introduced to Martha Graham at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. She became Graham's technical assistant, which led to a lifelong collaboration with Graham. She worked with Graham on 36 productions. Rosenthal studied lighting design at the Yale School of Drama from 1931 to 1934 with Stanley McCandless.
She returned to New York City, where she joined the Federal Theatre Project in 1935. This led to collaborations with Orson Welles and John Houseman. She would later follow Welles to the Mercury Theatre, where she was credited as a member of the board in addition to production and lighting manager, although not as lighting designer.
Some of her major contributions were the elimination of shadows by using floods of upstage lighting and controlling angles and mass of illumination to create contrasts without shadows. "Some of the signature lighting she did for Balanchine and the diagonal shaft of light she created for Graham (lovingly referred to by her as "Martha's Finger of God"), are now in such widespread use by dance companies of every style that they have become standards of the lighting repertoire."
She was light designer for hundreds of productions, including Broadway, Martha Graham's dances, the New York City Ballet, and the Metropolitan Opera. On Broadway she lit musicals such as "West Side Story" (1957), "The Sound of Music" (1959), "Take Me Along" (1959), "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" (1962), "Fiddler on the Roof" (1964), "Hello, Dolly!" (1964), "Cabaret" (1966), and "The Happy Time" (1968).
Death.
On May 1, 1969, she died of cancer at the age of 57. Her book, "Magic of Light: The Craft and Career of Jean Rosenthal, Pioneer in Lighting for the Modern Stage", (Little Brown & Co, ISBN 0-316-93120-9) was published posthumously in 1972. Lael Wertenbaker assembled the book, a long-running project between her and Rosenthal, from tape-recorded dictation sessions.

<doc id="2858870" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2858870" title="Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)">
Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)

Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education) 3 S.C.R. 3, 2003 SCC 62, was a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which followed the Nova Scotia Supreme Court's finding that a delay in building French language schools in Nova Scotia violated the claimants' minority language educational rights under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This finding led to an important debate regarding the scope of section 24(1) of the Charter, which provides for remedies for those whose rights are infringed, and the applicability of the common law doctrine of "functus officio". While the Supreme Court of Canada split on what constitutes an appropriate usage of section 24(1), the majority favoured a section 24(1) with broad, flexible capabilities.
Background.
According to the Supreme Court of Canada, Nova Scotia's past had not been marked by a great deal of governmental action for providing education in French. After 1982, however, section 23 was added to the Constitution of Canada, thus creating a right for Francophone and Acadian Nova Scotians to schooling in their own language, provided that they were of a sufficient number. Several Francophone families in five school districts, Kingston/Greenwood, Chéticamp, Île Madame-Arichat (Petit-de-Grat), Argyle, and Clare, tried to invoke that right, requesting new buildings or programs for primary and secondary education, and the provincial government responded with affirmation that section 23 did indeed mandate that this request be fulfilled. This affirmation was, however, followed by delay, and in 1998, with no schools having been built, the minority language community turned to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to move the government to meet its obligation.
The court heard the case in October 1999. The court was led by Justice LeBlanc, who found that section 23 required new schools and programs for the families. Moreover, he ruled that the delay in construction also constituted an infringement of the claimants' section 23 rights. He reached the latter conclusion by pointing out that French language Nova Scotians were increasingly being absorbed into the English language community. Hence, any further delay would eventually jeopardize the existence of the French community. Since the French community's requests were also anchored on a constitutional principle, they also deserved priority. Accordingly, LeBlanc used section 24(1) of the Charter to set deadlines and demand that the government report to him as construction progressed.
The obligation of the provincial government to report to Justice LeBlanc was disputed, as it was considered a violation of "functus officio", in which a judge makes a ruling and afterwards has no authority. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal sided with the government and overturned the requirement of reporting, citing concerns about moving Canada towards United States-style injunctions and upsetting the relationship between the Canadian court system and the government. The argument that section 23 gave the claimants a right to French programs and schools, however, was not questioned.
Decision.
While construction had been completed by the time the minority language families appealed their case to the Supreme Court of Canada, Justices Frank Iacobucci and Louise Arbour, writing for the majority of the Court, declined to set aside the case for mootness. They went on to vindicate the position of Justice LeBlanc and overturn the Court of Appeal. 
Section 23.
The majority of the Supreme Court approved the creative method for enforcing section 23 partly by emphasizing the importance of section 23 and how it was always meant to be an enforceable right. Section 23, they wrote, has a "remedial nature... designed to correct past injustices not only by halting the progressive erosion of minority official language cultures across Canada, but also by actively promoting their flourishing." Hence, section 23 is a positive right requiring government action.
Section 24.
Regarding section 24, the majority cited past Charter cases such as "R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd." (1986), "Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act" (1985), and "Vriend v. Alberta" (1998) to point out that the courts have approached the Charter with a "generous and expansive interpretation and not a narrow, technical, or legalistic one." This style of interpretation, the majority felt, was just as applicable for remedies as rights, and they observed the broad wording of section 24(1), which merely dictates that the court will award a "remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances." Since section 23 must be enforced, section 24(1) must be "responsive" to an infringement of the right, and since section 24(1) is itself an important part of the Charter, the remedy must be "effective." While judicial restraint is important, it is limited by the obligation of the Court to enforce constitutional rights. 
The circumstances, which included the threat that the French language would eventually disappear, were judged to require a remedy that would ensure the right would be met in a reasonable amount of time. The section 24(1) phrase limiting remedies, requiring that they be "appropriate and just in the circumstances", was defined partly as giving the courts themselves the right to determine what was appropriate and just, although judges should be aware of doctrines such as "functus officio." The Supreme Court also defined an "appropriate and just remedy," as being one that upholds the right, including with regard to circumstances. It is also appropriate and just to remember that as part of the constitution, and with broad wording, section 24 can "evolve to meet the challenges and circumstances of those cases" and can have "novel and creative features." The Court should avoid taking functions it could not hold and should be fair to the government, but in this case hearing reports was judged to allow the court to exercise its constitutional function to enforce rights. In addition, the court would not "improperly take over the detailed management and co-ordination of the construction projects."
With regard to "functus officio", the Court ruled that this common law principle cannot invalidate section 24, although it is an important consideration. The Court ultimately concluded "functus officio" was not violated because the reports did not "alter a final judgment." While LeBlanc could see reports, he could not change his decision to further define section 23.
Dissent.
The justices who did not side with Iacobucci and Arbour did not dispute the applicability or importance of section 23. Instead, a dissent regarding the usage of section 24(1) was written by Justices Louis LeBel and Marie Deschamps. They justified their dissent on the grounds that in order for the courts to "avoid turning themselves into managers of the public service... Judicial interventions should end when and where the case of which a judge is seized is brought to a close." In their view, Justice LeBlanc seeing reports amounted to overseeing the construction, which violated "functus officio" and the separation of powers, which could, in turn, threaten judicial independence. The dissenting justices also felt Justice LeBlanc had an option not to require reports, and section 23 still could have been enforced.
Justice LeBlanc's expectations, moreover, were not judged to be clear enough to the government. Fundamental justice was thus seen as having been violated.
The majority responded to these concerns by arguing that "the approach taken by... LeBel and Deschamps JJ. which appears to contemplate that special remedies might be available in some circumstances, but not in this case, severely undervalues the importance and the urgency of the language rights in the context facing LeBlanc J."

Iain Fyfe

Iain Fyfe (born 3 April 1982) is an Australian footballer who plays as a defender for Mes Kerman in the Iran Pro League.
Club career.
On completion of his SASI program in 2000, Iain joined hometown NSL club Adelaide City. After just three appearances off the bench in 2000–01, he broke into the Adelaide first team the following season, making 52 appearances in two years before moving to Sydney Olympic in 2003. He also earned a call up to the Australian Under-23 side for a friendly against Spain, but it would be the only one. Domestically, his move was positive, becoming a key figure for Olympic, playing all-but-one matches of the 2003–04 season.
Scotland.
Following the collapse of the NSL after that season, Fyfe went overseas and trialled at various clubs, including Scottish Premier League side Hibernian, before signing for Hamilton Academical in the Scottish Second Division. There he played alongside fellow Australians, David Carney as well as childhood friend and former Adelaide City teammate Scott Tunbridge. Fyfe struggled to break into the Hamilton first team, making only fifteen appearances before being released in early 2005.
Sydney FC.
Partnered next to first Mark Rudan and later Jacob Timpano, Fyfe was in the Sydney first XI for much of the A-League season. However he was dropped to the bench for the penultimate round due to inconsistent form. Several strong performances from Rudan kept him there, making only one start and three appearances off the bench in the club's last five games, although a missed match was through suspension. In the A-League grand final, Fyfe played an important role in defending Sydney's 1–0 lead over the Central Coast Mariners, having replaced injured Mark Rudan with 20 minutes remaining.
In the 2006–07 season, Fyfe was shifted to a wide defensive role by new coach Terry Butcher, who opted to play Mark Milligan in midfield rather than his usual right back position. The impact of the move was immediately apparent with Fyfe, goal-less in the previous season, scoring the winning goal against Central Coast in the opening round and netting again in the 3–2 loss to Melbourne Victory a week later. He went on to play every match of the season up until Sydney's semi-final exit. Strong performances led to another call up to the national team, included in the A-League-based Australian side for the 2007 Asian Cup qualifier against Kuwait on 16 August 2006, but again did not make an appearance.
During the Pan-Pacific Championship Iain played his 100th competitive game against Major League Soccer Glamour team Los Angeles Galaxy. Sydney went on to lose the match 2–1, with Sydney's goal coming from Brendan Renaud. He was Sydney's most capped player, and most consistent, only missing 3 competitive matches, in the 3 years Sydney have played in the A-League.
Adelaide United.
On 24 November 2008, it was announced in November that Iain had signed a contract with Adelaide United commencing April 2009; this brings Fyfe back to Adelaide where he began his career after 5 years playing in Sydney and Scotland. Starting all the games in the opening of his first season back at Adelaide, Fyfe's first goal allowed his club to equalise against Wellington Phoenix in round five.
He scored his second goal for Adelaide in a 1–1 draw against Central Coast Mariners in Round 2 of the 2010–11 season. On 14 January 2011, It was announced that Iain would be joining K-league club Busan I'Park FC. His farewell game for Adelaide was meant to be on 29 January 2011 against Central Coast Mariners at Hindmarsh Stadium, but due to a hamstring injury his last game was on 21 January 2011 against North Queensland Fury when they won 8–1.
Busan I'Park.
In January 2011, Fyfe joined South Korean club Busan I'Park. Fyfe made his first start and debut for Busan I'Park in their 2–1 away loss to Jeju United in the first week of the 2011 K-League season.
Return to Adelaide United.
On 29 February 2012, it was announced that Fyfe had signed a one year undisclosed contract with club Adelaide United after his contract with South Korea K-League club Busan I'Park.
Mes Kerman.
He was linked to a move to the Iran Pro League in summer 2013. On 2 August 2013, Mes Kerman announced that Fyfe will be joined to the team after passing medical test. He officially joined to the team on 10 August and signed a two years contract. He made his debut in a 1–0 lose to Saipa.
International career.
Fyfe started his career in 1999, joining a talent identification program at the South Australian Sports Institute, and was soon exposed to the international football stage. He was selected for the Australian U17 side in qualifying matches for the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship and retained his place in the Joeys squad for the final tournament in New Zealand. Australia marched through to the final against Brazil, the match ending scoreless after extra time and proceeding to penalties. Fyfe entered the match as a substitute in extra time to secure the defence, but in the shoot-out he was tasked with Australia's ninth penalty kick. His shot was dramatically saved by goalkeeper Rubinho, allowing Brazil to take the title.
On 16 February 2005, Iain Fyfe returned to Australia became the 16th member of the inaugural Sydney FC squad. Playing at centre back under coach Pierre Littbarski, Fyfe was instrumental in Sydney's qualification for the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship, being named Player of the Tournament for the 2005 Oceania Club Championship. This prompted his inclusion in a Socceroo training camp with new manager Guus Hiddink, and his inclusion on the substitutes bench for the World Cup qualifier against Solomon Islands.

You Know What to Do

"You Know What to Do" was one of the first songs written and recorded by George Harrison with the Beatles. It was recorded on 3 June 1964 (see 1964 in music) and does not appear on any album except 1995's "Anthology 1" release (see 1995 in music).
Background.
During a photographic assignment on the morning of 3 June 1964, Ringo Starr was taken ill with tonsillitis and pharyngitis, 24 hours before the Beatles were due to leave for a six country tour. The original session booked for that day was cancelled so that a replacement drummer, Jimmie Nicol, could be brought in and rehearse with the band. After running through six songs in a one hour rehearsal in Abbey Road Studio Two, everyone felt satisfied with Nicol's drumming, and he left to pack his suitcase.
That evening, in a four hour session in Abbey Road Studio Two, each of the three present Beatles recorded a demo of a newly written song. Harrison recorded "You Know What to Do", John Lennon did "No Reply", which eventually ended up as the opening track of their next album "Beatles for Sale", and Paul McCartney did "It's for You", a song which was written specifically for Cilla Black to sing. The tape of the session was subsequently misfiled, and was re-discovered in 1993.
After "Anthology 1" was released, Harrison was asked about the song and he said he did not even remember its existence.
Harrison's previous contribution to the Beatles' output was "Don't Bother Me", recorded 11–12 September 1963. His next contribution was not until "I Need You", recorded 15 February 1965. Asked about this gap, in "The Beatles Off the Record" in 1965, and referring obliquely to "You Know What To Do", George Martin explained that Harrison "got discouraged some time ago when none of us liked something that he had written".
Musical structure.
The song is in the key of A major. After an introduction in D chord on the guitar the verse begins in A (I) on "When I see you I just don't know what to say" ending that line with E (V). The verse also features a D (IV) chord. Pedler cites the song as an example of how "one of the The Beatles' greatest contributions to pop songwriting was their skill in combining the familiarity of simple I-IV-V sequences with dramatically new harmonic material." The bridge features an '8-7-flat7-6' glide in consecutive semitones down the chromatic scale, a device also used in Michelle, Cry Baby Cry, Got To Get You Into My Life, And Your Bird Can Sing and Mother Nature's Son.

Rockingham, Nova Scotia

Rockingham is a community located in Nova Scotia's Halifax Regional Municipality.
Geography.
Rockingham is situated on the western shore of Bedford Basin.
It is north of Clayton Park and Fairview and south of Bedford; specifically, Birch Cove and Princes Lodge. Its eastern extent is formed by the shore of the Bedford Basin and its western extent is generally the top of the ridge that rises from the Basin, although this was subsequently extended westward to an area near the Birch Cove Lakes and Highway 102.
History.
The first Europeans to settle in what was to become Rockingham were foreign Protestant farmers and innkeepers, starting in 1784. While the inns were too close to the city to benefit from stage coach traffic, they were conveniently located for drovers bringing their livestock to the Halifax market. Drovers lodged at the inns and kept their animals in the pastures while they arranged for their sale and slaughter.
In the 1840s William Evens and William Davey bought properties on the western shore of the basin. Evens, a butcher, built a slaughterhouse, while Davey established a large inn called the Four Mile House. When the Nova Scotia Railway was being built the two men persuaded the railway board to locate the first stop at Four Mile House. On February 1, 1855, the first ceremonial run of the Nova Scotia Railway came to Four Mile House. The village that grew up around the railway station took the name Four Mile House.
In 1886, the residents of the Four Mile House district decided their community needed a name that better reflected its growing prosperity. The name Rockingham Station was inspired by the Rockingham Inn that had been located two miles north at Prince's Lodge. This particular inn had burned down in 1833 but lived on in memory due to its links with Lieutenant Governor Sir John Wentworth, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, and Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, a powerful English noble and friend of the Wentworths.
The construction of the Nova Scotia Railway in 1855 altered the character of the community. Destruction of the shoreline cut off farmers from some resources, but eventually the railway helped the village to grow and prosper. Country life was now easily accessible; wealthy families built grand summer homes and transient visitors enjoyed staying at the Wayside Inn (formerly the Five Mile House) and other tourist accommodations in Rockingham.
The Four Mile House district was selected by the Roman Catholic Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul in the early 1870s for a convent and institution of higher learning. "Mount St. Vincent" was built up the hill on a large parcel of land almost directly opposite the NSR station. The convent, along with its women's finishing school, Mount St. Vincent Academy and associated residence facilities opened in 1873 following approximately one year of construction.
The Intercolonial Railway (ICR), which had taken over the NSR, expropriated waterfront land at Rockingham Station from the Sisters of Charity during the early 1900s to widen its trackage leading to Fairview. Immediately prior to the Halifax Explosion, telegraph operator Vince Coleman managed to warn an incoming passenger train to hold at Rockingham Station's passenger station (the last ICR station stop before Richmond terminal), ultimately saving countless lives. The new rock cut being built for the railway through south end Halifax was finished in 1918 under the newly created Canadian National Railways (CNR), with some of the blasted rock being used as infill to create the Halifax Ocean Terminals in the south end of the city, as well as infill of Bedford Basin off Rockingham Station to create what is now the Rockingham Railway Yard.
In 1925, Mount St. Vincent Academy was upgraded in status to a women's junior college. The community of Rockingham Station began to experience some subdivision of land as it was located in a cheaper tax jurisdiction (the Municipality of the County of Halifax) as opposed to the adjacent city which ended at Fairview. On April 5, 1961, the village's name was formally simplified by the provincial government to just Rockingham.
The creation of Bicentennial Drive, an all-weather bypass highway to Bedford, likely spurred construction of the first major subdivision developments in 1962, although much of the Rockingham area on the hillside overlooking Bedford Basin would require significant blasting to create streets and underground services. Mount St. Vincent College was upgraded to a full university, named Mount St. Vincent University, in 1966.
On January 1, 1969, the community of Rockingham, along with many other surrounding areas of the Municipality of Halifax County were amalgamated into the City of Halifax.
Rockingham continued to benefit from being located immediately north of the peninsular city on the Highway 102 corridor to Bedford and beyond. The opening of the A. Murray MacKay Bridge in 1970 led to improved connections between Rockingham and western Halifax to the City of Dartmouth and particularly a new industrial park named Burnside which would become a major regional employer. A smaller industrial park named Bayers Lake was also built near Rockingham on the west side of Highway 102. New residential developments in the expanding city were subsequently built in Rockingham such as the Clayton Park subdivision, located along the eastern slope of Geizer's Hill on the Rockingham-Fairview boundary.
During the 1970s-1980s, CN Rail and later Via Rail operated a form of commuter rail passenger service on the railway line along Bedford Basin into downtown Halifax using frequently scheduled Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs) which were destined for Yarmouth, Moncton and Sydney. Rockingham's station was closed after the January 15, 1990 budget cuts to Via Rail saw these services discontinued. The Bedford Highway was redeveloped during the early 1990s into a major collector road from Birch Cove into the city.
On April 1, 1996, the City of Halifax was merged into the Halifax Regional Municipality. Preceding and following amalgamation, subdivision development in the western part of Rockingham continued apace, spurred in particular by the opening of Dunbrack Street and Northwest Arm Drive, however the most significant period of recent growth in Rockingham occurred between 1997-2003 with the Clayton Park West subdivision which was a 20-year development that filled within a quarter of the budgeted timeframe. Clayton Park West became one of the fastest-growing, densest new developments in Nova Scotian urban history. The rapid development was spurred by the conversion of the Bayers Lake Industrial Park into a "business park" model containing Halifax's first big box outlet stores, as well as new highway interchange construction between Lacewood Drive and Highway 102.
Today, the focus of Rockingham has moved from the former suburban centre located on the Bedford Highway, slightly north of Mount St. Vincent University and the CN station, to the new development at Clayton Park West which now extends to the northern extents of Rockingham at the Kearney Lake Road.

Black Jack (horse)

A coal-black Morgan-American Quarter Horse cross, Black Jack served in the Caisson Platoon of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard). Named in honor of General John J. (Black Jack) Pershing, he was the riderless horse in more than 1,000 Armed Forces Full Honors Funerals (AFFHF), the majority of which were in Arlington National Cemetery. With boots reversed in the stirrups, he was a symbol of a fallen leader.
Early life.
Black Jack was foaled January 19, 1947, and came to Fort Myer from the Cavalry remount station at Fort Reno, Oklahoma, on November 22, 1952. Black Jack was the last of the Quartermaster–issue horses branded with the Army's U.S. brand (on the left shoulder) and his Army serial number 2V56 (on the left side of his neck).
Career.
Black Jack served a long and respectable military career. Among the highlights were that he participated in four state funerals:
Army Major General Philip C. Wehle was the commanding general of the Military District of Washington during those state funerals, except for LBJ's; during LBJ's, it was Army Major General James Adamson.
Death and burial.
Black Jack died after a 29-year military career on February 6, 1976. He was cremated, with his remains laid to rest in a plot at Fort Myer, Virginia, on Summerall Field; his final resting place lies 200 feet (60 m) northeast of the flagpole in the southeast corner of the parade field. He is one of only two horses in United States history to be buried with Full Military Honors, the other being Comanche.

<doc id="2858897" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2858897" title="Demersal fish">
Demersal fish

Demersal fish live and feed on or near the bottom of seas or lakes (the demersal zone). They occupy the sea floors and lake beds, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks. In coastal waters they are found on or near the continental shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise. They are not generally found in the deepest waters, such as abyssal depths or on the abyssal plain, but they can be found around seamounts and islands. The word "demersal" comes from the Latin "demergere", which means "to sink".
Demersal fish are bottom feeders. They can be contrasted with pelagic fish which live and feed away from the bottom in the open water column. Demersal fish fillets contain little fish oil (one to four percent), whereas pelagic fish can contain up to 30 percent.
Types.
Demersal fish can be divided into two main types: strictly benthic fish which can rest on the sea floor, and benthopelagic fish which can float in the water column just above the sea floor.
Benthopelagic fish have neutral buoyancy, so they can float at depth without much effort, while strictly benthic fish are more dense, with negative buoyancy so they can lie on the bottom without any effort. Most demersal fish are benthopelagic.
As with other bottom feeders, a mechanism to deal with substrate is often necessary. With demersal fish the sand is usually pumped out of the mouth through the gill slit. Most demersal fish exhibit a flat ventral region so as to more easily rest their body on the substrate. The exception may be the flatfish, which are laterally depressed but lie on their sides. Also, many exhibit what is termed an "inferior" mouth, which means that the mouth is pointed downwards; this is beneficial as their food is often going to be below them in the substrate. Those bottom feeders with upward-pointing mouths, such as stargazers, tend to seize swimming prey.
Benthic fish.
Benthic fish, sometimes called groundfish, are denser than water, so they can rest on the sea floor. They either lie-and-wait as ambush predators, maybe covering themselves with sand or otherwise camouflaging themselves, or move actively over the bottom in search for food. Benthic fish which can bury themselves include dragonets, flatfish and stingrays.
Flatfish are an order of ray-finned benthic fishes which lie flat on the ocean floor. Examples are flounder, sole, turbot, plaice, and halibut. The adult fish of many species have both eyes on one side of the head. When the fish hatches, one eye is located on each side of its head. But as the fish grows from the larval stage, one eye migrates to the other side of the body as a process of metamorphosis. The flatfish then changes its habits, and camouflages itself by lying on the bottom of the ocean floor with both eyes facing upwards. The side on which the eye migrates depends on the species, so some species end up with both eyes on their left side, and others on the right.
Flounder ambush their prey, feeding at soft muddy area of the sea bottom, near bridge piles, docks, artificial and coral reefs. Their diet consists mainly of fish spawn, crustaceans, polychaetes and small fish. 
The great hammerhead swings its head in broad angles over the sea floor to pick up the electrical signatures of stingrays buried in the sand. It then uses its "hammer" to pin down the stingray.
Some fishes don't fit into the above classification. For example, the family of nearly blind spiderfishes, common and widely distributed, feed on benthopelagic zooplankton. Yet they are strictly benthic fish, since they stay in contact with the bottom. Their fins have long rays they use to "stand" on the bottom while they face the current and grab zooplankton as it passes by.
The bodies of benthic fish are adapted for ongoing contact with the sea floor. Swimbladders are usually absent or reduced, and the bodies are usually flattened in one way or another. Following Moyle and Cech (2004) they can be divided into five overlapping body shapes:
Benthopelagic fish.
Benthopelagic fish inhabit the water just above the bottom, feeding on benthos and zooplankton. Most demersal fish are benthopelagic.
Deep sea benthopelagic teleosts all have swimbladders. The dominant species, rattails and cusk eels, have considerable biomass. Other species include deep sea cods (morids), deep sea eels, halosaurs and notacanths.
Benthopelagic sharks, like the deep sea squaloid sharks, achieve neutral buoyancy with the use of large oil-filled livers. Sharks adapt well to fairly high pressures. They can often be found on slopes down to about 2000 metres, scavenging on food falls such as dead whales. However, the energy demands of sharks are high, since they need to swim constantly and maintain a large amount of oil for buoyancy. These energy needs cannot be met in the extreme oligotrophic conditions that occur at great depths.
Shallow water stingrays are benthic, and can lie on the bottom because of their negative buoyancy. Deep sea stingrays are benthopelagic, and like the squaloids have very large livers which give them neutral buoyancy.
Benthopelagic fish can be divided into flabby or robust body types. Flabby benthopelagic fishes are like bathypelagic fishes; they have a reduced body mass, and low metabolic rates, expending minimal energy as they lie and wait to ambush prey. An example of a flabby fish is the cusk-eel "Acanthonus armatus", a predator with a huge head and a body that is 90 percent water. This fish has the largest ears (otoliths) and the smallest brain in relation to its body size of all known vertebrates.
Deepwater benthopelagic fish are robust, muscular swimmers that actively cruise the bottom searching for prey. They often live around features, such as seamounts, which have strong currents. Commercial examples are the orange roughy and Patagonian toothfish.
Habitats.
The edge of the continental shelf marks the boundary where the shelf gives way to, and then gradually drops into abyssal depths. This edge marks the boundary between coastal, relatively shallow, benthic habitats, and the deep benthic habitats. Coastal demersal fishes live on the bottom of inshore waters, such as bays and estuaries, and further out, on the floor of the continental shelf. Deep water demersal fish live beyond this edge, mostly down the continental slopes and along the continental rises which drop to the abyssal plains. This is the continental margin, constituting about 28% of the total oceanic area. Other deep sea demersal fish can also be found around seamounts and islands.
The term "bathydemersal fish" is sometimes used instead of "deep water demersal fish". "Bathydemersal" refers to demersal fish which live at depths greater than 200 metres.
The term "epibenthic" is also used to refer to organism that live on top of the ocean floor, as opposed to those that burrow into the seafloor substrate. However the terms "mesodemersal", "epidemersal", "mesobenthic" and "bathybenthic" are not used.
Coastal.
Coastal demersal fish are found on or near the seabed of coastal waters between the shoreline and the edge of the continental shelf, where the shelf drops into the deep ocean. Since the continental shelf is generally less than 200 metres deep, this means that coastal waters are generally epipelagic. The term includes demersal reef fish and demersal fish that inhabit estuaries, inlets and bays.
Young mangrove jacks, a sought after eating and sport fish, dwell in estuaries around mangrove roots, fallen trees, rock walls, and any other snag areas where smaller prey reside for protection. When they mature, they migrate into open waters, sometimes hundreds of kilometres from the coast to spawn.
Stargazers are found worldwide in shallow waters. They have eyes on top of their heads and a large upward-facing mouth. They bury themselves in sand, and leap upwards to ambush benthopelagic fish and invertebrates that pass overhead. Some species have a worm-shaped lure growing out of the floor of the mouth, which they wiggle to attract prey. Stargazers are venomous and can deliver electric shocks. They have been called "the meanest things in creation."
Other examples of coastal demersal fish are cod, plaice, monkfish and sole.
Deep water.
Deep water demersal fish occupy the benthic regions beyond the continental margins.
On the continental slope, demersal fishes are common. They are more diverse than coastal demersal fish, since there is more habitat diversity. Further out are the abyssal plains. These flat, featureless regions occupy about 40 percent of the ocean floor. They are covered with sediment but largely devoid of benthic life (benthos). Deep sea benthic fishes are more likely to associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains, where invertebrate communities are established. Undersea mountains (seamounts) can intercept deep sea currents, and cause productive upwellings which support benthic fish. Undersea mountain ranges can separate underwater regions into different ecosystems.
Rattails and brotulas are common, and other well established families are eels, eelpouts, hagfishes, greeneyes, batfishes and lumpfishes.
The bodies of deep water demersal fishes are muscular with well developed organs. In this way they are closer to mesopelagic fishes than bathypelagic fishes. In other ways, they are more variable. Photophores are usually absent, eyes and swimbladders range from absent to well developed. They vary in size, and larger species, greater than one metre, are not uncommon.
Deep sea demersal fish are usually long and narrow. Many are eels or shaped like eels. This may be because long bodies have long lateral lines. Lateral lines detect low-frequency sounds, and some demersal fishes have muscles that drum such sounds to attract mates. Smell is also important, as indicated by the rapidity with which demersal fish find traps baited with bait fish.
The main diet of deep sea demersal fish is invertebrates of the deep sea benthos and carrion. Smell, touch and lateral line sensitivities seem to be the main sensory devices for locating these.
Like coastal demersal fish, deep sea demersal fish can be divided into benthic fish and benthopelagic fish, where the benthic fish are negatively buoyant and benthopelagic fish are neutrally buoyant.
The availability of plankton for food diminishes rapidly with depth. At 1000 metres, the biomass of plankton is typically about 1 percent of that at the surface, and at 5000 metres about 0.01 percent. Given there is no sunlight, energy enters deep water zones as organic matter. There are three main ways this happens. Firstly, organic matter can move into the zone from the continental landmass, for example, through currents that carry the matter down rivers, then plume along the continental shelf and finally spill down the continental slope. Other matter enters as particulate matter raining down from the overhead water column in the form of marine snow, or as sinking overhead plant material such as eelgrass, or as "large particles" such as dead fish and whales sinking to the bottom. A third way energy can arrive is through fish, such as vertically migrating mesopelagic fishes that can enter into the demersal zone as they ascend or descend. The demersal fish and invertebrates consume organic matter that does arrive, break it down and recycle it. A consequence of these energy delivery mechanisms is that the abundance of demersal fish and invertebrates gradually decrease as the distance from continental shorelines increases.
Although deep water demersal fish species are not generally picky about what they eat, there is still some degree of specialisation. For example, different fish have different mouth sizes, which determines the size of the prey they can handle. Some feed mostly on benthopelagic organisms. Others fed mostly on epifauna (invertebrates on top of the seafloor surface, also called "epibenthos"), or alternatively on infauna (invertebrates that burrow into the seafloor substrate). Infauna feeders can have considerable sediment in their stomachs. Scavengers, such as snubnosed eels and hagfish, also eat infauna as a secondary food source.
Some feed on carrion. Cameras show that when a dead fish is placed on the bottom, vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers appear very quickly. If the fish is large, some scavengers burrow in and eat it from the inside out. Some fish, such as grenadiers, also appear and start feeding on the scavenging inverebrates and amphipods. Other specialization is based on depth distribution. Some of the more abundant upper continental slope fish species, such as cutthroat eel and longfinned hake, mainly feed on epipelagic fish. But generally, the most abundant deep water demersal fish species feed on invertebrates.
At great depths, food scarcity and extreme pressure limits the ability of fish to survive. The deepest point of the ocean is about 11,000 metres. Bathypelagic fishes are not normally found below 3,000 metres. It may be that extreme pressures interfere with essential enzyme functions.
The deepest-living fish known, the strictly benthic "Abyssobrotula galatheae", eel-like and blind, feeds on benthic invertebrates. A living example was trawled from the bottom of the Puerto Rico Trench in 1970 from a depth of 8,370 metres (27,453 ft).
In 2008, a shoal of 17 hadal snailfish, a species of deep water snailfish, was filmed by a UK-Japan team using remote operated landers at depths of in the Japan Trench in the Pacific. The fish were 30 centimetres long (12 in), and were darting about, using vibration sensors on their nose to catch shrimps. The team also reported that the appearance of the fish, unlike that of most deep sea fish, was surprisingly "cute", and that they were surprised by how active the fish were at these depths.
Demersal fisheries.
Most demersal fish of commercial or recreational interest are coastal, confined to the upper 200 metres. Commercially important demersal food fish species include flatfish, such as flounder, sole, turbot, plaice, and halibut. Also important are cod, hake, redfish, haddock, bass, congers, sharks, rays and chimaeras.
The following table shows the world capture production of some groups of demersal species in tonnes.
Black sea bass inhabit US coasts from Maine to NE Florida and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and are most abundant off the waters of New York. They are found in inshore waters (bays and sounds) and offshore in waters up to a depth of 130 m (425'). They spend most of their time close to the sea floor and are often congregated around bottom formations such as rocks, man-made reefs, wrecks, jetties, piers, and bridge pilings. Black sea bass are sought after recreational and commercial fish, and have been overfished.
Grouper are often found around reefs. They have stout bodies and large mouths. They are not built for long-distance or fast swimming. They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. They lie in wait, rather than chasing in open water. They are found in areas of hard or consolidated substrate, and use structural features such as ledges, rocks, and coral reefs ( as well as artificial reefs like wrecks and sunken barges) as their habitat.
Their mouth and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance. They also use their mouth to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful that it is nearly impossible to pull them out of their cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in. There is some research indicating that roving coral groupers ("Plectropomus pessuliferus") sometimes cooperate with giant morays in hunting.
Deepwater benthopelagic fish are robust, muscular swimmers that actively cruise the bottom searching for prey. They often live around features, such as seamounts, which have strong currents. Commercial examples are the orange roughy and Patagonian toothfish. Because these fish were once abundant, and because their robust bodies are good to eat, these fish have been commercially harvested.
Conservation status.
Major demersal fishery species in the North Sea such as cod, plaice, monkfish and sole, are listed by the ICES as "outside safe biological limits."

John Kennedy, Sr.

John Kennedy, Sr. (born 20 December 1928) is an Australian rules football coach and player.
Early life/playing career.
Born in Camberwell, Kennedy's professional career began as a school principal. In 1950, he joined the Hawthorn Football Club as a player. Over the next ten years, he played 169 games for Hawthorn, serving as Captain from 1955 until his retirement, and winning the club's Best and Fairest award four times (in 1950, 51, 52 and 54).
Coaching career.
He got a rushed introduction to coaching in 1957, regular coach Jack Hale was involved in an automobile accident on the way to Glenferrie Oval and missed the game. Kennedy at short notice addressed the players during the game breaks and was rewarded with a 21 point victory over Essendon.
In 1960, he took over as Hawthorn coach, and led the team to their first premiership in 1961. In 1963, he stepped down as coach, but Hawthorn's poor onfield performance over the next few years saw him recalled to the role in 1967. He coached Hawthorn to subsequent premierships in 1971 and 1976, when he again stepped down from the role.
In 1985, Kennedy became the coach of the North Melbourne Football Club, and coached them until 1989. In total he coached for 411 games, Won 236, Lost 170 and Drew 5. In all, Kennedy coached Hawthorn and North Melbourne to 5 Grand Finals with 3 Premiership wins.
Legacy.
As a player, Kennedy was renowned for his toughness and skill.
As a coach, Kennedy has a similar reputation for toughness, but also for oratory. Kennedy is notorious for borrowing ideas from any source he thinks will inspire the players, but it is his passion rather than his quotations that he is best known for. In the 1975 VFL Grand Final against North Melbourne, his exhortation to the Hawthorn players at half time was: ""At least DO SOMETHING! DO! Don't think, don't hope, do! At least you can come off and say 'I did this, I shepherded, I played on. At least I did something.'"" Despite this his team still lost convincingly.
He is famous for his battered brown overcoat, which is now on display at the Hawthorn Football Club.
He was an inaugural induction into the Australian Football Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1999.
Kennedy's grandson Josh Kennedy was recruited by Hawthorn under the father/son rule in the 2006 AFL Draft. His son John Kennedy Jr. also played for the Hawks.
Statue.
In honor of his 80th birthday, a statue of him overlooking Waverley Park was unveiled. The text on the plaque reads

91 Aquarii

91 Aquarii, also known as Psi1 Aquarii (, ), is the Flamsteed designation for a triple star system in the equatorial constellation of Aquarius. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +4.248. Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of around from Earth. An extrasolar planet is known to orbit the main star.
Stellar system.
91 Aquarii is a triple star system. The primary component, 91 Aqr A, is a giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. This is an evolved star with 174% of the Sun's mass that has expanded to over 10 times the size of the Sun. It is radiating 49 times the Sun's luminosity from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,603 K. This gives it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star.
The primary shares a common proper motion with two others stars, 91 Aqr B and C, suggesting that they are physically connected. The latter pair form a binary system located at an angular separation of 52 arcseconds from the primary. They are 10th magnitude stars separated by 0.3 arcseconds from each other.
Because it lies near the same line of sight, the binary star system CCDM J23159-0905DE was listed to belong to the 91 Aquarii system according to the CCDM catalogue. However, it is listed as physically unconnected in the WDS catalogue and the pair have a different proper motion than 91 Aquarii. CCDM J23159-0905DE has two components, the 13th magnitude CCDM J23159-0905D 80.4 arcseconds from 91 Aquarii, and the 14th magnitude CCDM J23159-0905E 19.7 arcseconds from 91 Aquarii.
Planetary system.
In 2003, the discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting 91 Aquarii A was announced. Despite controversy, the exoplanet was confirmed again on Jan 03, 2011 by the Conference " Planetary Systems Beyond the Main Sequence", Bamberg 2010 (Quirrenbach "et al.").

Ruth Bancroft Law

Ruth Bancroft Law (May 21, 1887 - 1970) was a pioneer American aviator during the 1910s.
Biography.
She was born on May 21, 1887. Around 1911 she married Charlie Oliver.
Law was instructed by Harry Atwood and Arch Freeman at Atwood Park in Saugus, Massachusetts. She received her pilot's license in November 1912. In 1915 she gave a demonstration of aerobatics at Daytona Beach, Florida, before a large crowd. She announced that she was going to "loop the loop" for the first time, and proceeded to do so, not once but twice, to the consternation of her husband Charles Oliver.
In the spring of 1916, Law took part in an altitude competition, twice narrowly coming second to male fliers. She was furious, determined to set a record that would stand against men as well as women.
Laws greatest feat took place on 19 November 1916, when she broke the existing cross-country distance flying record of 452 miles (728 km) set by Victor Carlstrom by flying non-stop from Chicago to New York State, a distance of 590 miles (950 km). The next day she flew on to New York City. Flying over Manhattan, her fuel cut out, but she glided to a safe landing on Governors Island and was met by United States Army Captain Henry "Hap" Arnold (who changed her spark plugs in the Curtiss pusher), who would one day become Commanding General of the United States Army Air Forces. She was the toast of the city; President Woodrow Wilson attended a dinner held in her honor on 2 December 1916.
After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Law campaigned unsuccessfully for women to be allowed to fly military aircraft. Stung by her rejection, she wrote an article entitled "Let Women Fly!" in the magazine "Air Travel", where she argued that success in aviation should prove a woman's fitness for work in that field.
After the war, Law continued to set records. After Raymonde de Laroche of France set a women's altitude record of nearly 13,000 feet (3,962 m) on 7 June 1919, Law broke Laroches record on 10 June, flying to 14,700 feet (4,481 m). Laroche in turn, however, broke Laws record on 12 June, flying to a height of 15,748 feet (4,800 m).
She died in 1970.
Legacy.
Law's brother was the parachutist and pioneer movie stuntman Rodman Law (1885-1919).

Tana Moon

The fictional character Tana Moon, a Metropolis reporter, was Superboy's first love, introduced as part of the "Reign of the Supermen" storyline.
Fictional character history.
When the young clone of Superman (later known as Kon-El) escapes from Project Cadmus, he goes to the Daily Planet. He tells his story to Lois Lane who brushes him off, thinking he was just another publicity hound. He sees Tana and is attracted to her. Superboy spots Tana leaving a building and sweeps her into the sky. He agrees to give her an exclusive after learning she is an anchorwoman for the Galaxy Network Broadcasting owned by Vincent Edge. Tana urges Superboy into more spectacular heroic feats and her own popularity rises as a result.
Eventually she parts ways from Superboy, as a way to gain acceptance and fame as her own woman, not only as the "Superboy reporter". She finds him again when Superboy settles down in Hawaii. After a while they rekindled her professional relationship, which eventually blossomed into true love, even if strained by the lack of maturity of Superboy, who was always in pursuit of a more exciting life between battles and girls.
During her time in Hawaii, Tana comes to befriend several more people. Agent Rex Leech, Rex's daughter Roxy, the super-powered Dubbilex and Bibbo Bibbowski's white puppy named Krypto. Roxy's love for Superboy would turn out to be a long-running conflict.
Superboy split up with Tana while he and Knockout were on the run from the law. Knockout turned out to be an evil murderer. Superboy defeats her and returns to Tana. Unfortunately, Tana shortly thereafter gave crucial information to Amanda Spence, who was posing as a harmless reporter. The info helped Spence and the Agenda capture Superboy and create the clone Match.
Tana struggled to keep alive their love, which was further affected by the knowledge Superboy would never age. The conflict with Roxy was soon neutralized. In the process of saving him from an illness, Roxy and Superboy's DNA come close to being identical, making them all but siblings. They decide to leave their feelings for each other as platonic. Despite this, Tana leaves again, only to find herself embroiled in Superboy's battle with "The Agenda". During the battle she is electrocuted by the vengeful Amanda Spence and dies. Tana's death marked the end of innocence for Superboy, leading him to a more responsible life.
Superboy, temporarily in adult form, would later confront Spence. Enraged, he slams Spence downward. This fools her into believing she is going to perish. He stops her movement, leaving her head inches from the floor. He declares that since he must live with the knowledge of what might have been with him and Tana, Spence must live with the knowledge she could have perished at his hands.
Superboy would battle and subdue Spence at least one more time.
In other media.
Tana Moon appears in the BBC radio drama adaptation of "The Death of Superman", "Funeral For a Friend", and "Reign of the Supermen!" storylines. It was released as "Superman: Doomsday and Beyond" in the United Kingdom by BBC Audiobooks and as "Superman Lives!" in the United States by Time Warner Audiobooks..

Memphis, New York

Memphis is a hamlet in the Town of Van Buren, west of Syracuse in Onondaga County, New York, United States.
Because of its location on the south town line of Van Buren, part of Memphis can be considered to be also in the Towns of Elbridge and Camillus. The community was also called, in the past, "Canton," though the name now refers to a small community between Camillus and Memphis.
The small community is spread over a wide area due to the primary use of land for farming, including a portion of Hourigan's Farm, the Hooper Farm, and the Bloomer Farms. Some interesting facts about the area include the area known on maps as "The Kingdom," named for Kingdom Road. This area is located west of State Route 31, south of the New York State Thruway, and east of River Road. There is a natural spring, known as Whiskey Hallow, which is located off to the east of Perry Road which the local community uses for a fresh source of water. "The Kingdom" is sometimes known as "Stan's Kingdom," apparently named for a man named Stan, but is often incorrectly known as "Satan's Kingdom."

Movement for the Liberation of Saguia el Hamra and Wadi el Dhahab

The Movement for the Liberation of Saguia el Hamra and Wadi el Dhahab, also referred to as the Liberation Movement ( Harakat Tahrir), Movement for the Liberation of the Sahara, Advanced Organization of the Sahara or simply the Muslim Party was a Sahrawi movement created in the late 1960s by Muhammad Bassiri, a Sahrawi journalist and quranic teacher.
Its aim was the peaceful overturning of Spanish colonial rule and achievement of Western Sahara's self-determination. It initially organized and operated in secret, but revealed its existence in a demonstration in El-Aaiun (Laayoune) against Spanish rule in 1970, attempting to hand over a petition to the Spanish colonial rulers calling for better treatment and Western Sahara's independence.
The protest was immediately and bloodily suppressed by the occupation forces. The massacre and ensuing disturbances has been named the Zemla Intifada, or uprising, after the place the demonstration was held. A nation-wide hunt for members of the movement followed: Bassiri himself was arrested and "disappeared" in Spanish custody. He is assumed to have been killed by his jailors, and is counted by the present-day Sahrawi nationalist movement as its first modern-day martyr.(Morocco, which claims Western Sahara as its own province, has also similarly attempted to appropriate his legacy, arguing that the Harakat Tahrir was primarily interested in ejecting Spain, not in achieving independence as a nation separate from Morocco.)
After the crushing of the Harakat Tahrir, Sahrawi nationalists abandoned the hope of a peaceful end to colonial occupation. In May 1973 the militant Front Polisario formed under the leadership of El-Ouali, calling for armed revolution against Spanish rule. The Polisario, which is still active, would later turn its guns on the Moroccan and Mauritanian forces which invaded Western Sahara upon Spain's departure in 1975.

<doc id="2858982" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2858982" title="Digital signature transponder">
Digital signature transponder

The Texas Instruments digital signature transponder (DST) is a cryptographically enabled radio-frequency identification (RFID) device used in a variety of wireless authentication applications. The largest deployments of the DST include the Exxon-Mobil Speedpass payment system (approximately 7 million transponders), as well as a variety of vehicle immobilizer systems used in many late model Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Toyota, and Nissan vehicles.
The DST is an unpowered "passive" transponder which uses a proprietary block cipher to implement a challenge-response authentication protocol. Each DST tag contains a quantity of non-volatile RAM, which stores a 40-bit encryption key. This key is used to encipher a 40-bit challenge issued by the reader, producing a 40-bit ciphertext, which is then truncated to produce a 24-bit response transmitted back to the reader. Verifiers (who also possess the encryption key) verify this challenge by computing the expected result and comparing it to the tag response. Transponder encryption keys are user programmable, using a simple over-the-air protocol. Once correctly programmed, transponders may be "locked" through a separate command, which prevents further changes to the internal key value. Each transponder is factory provisioned with a 24-bit serial number and 8-bit manufacturer code. These values are fixed, and cannot be altered.
The DST40 cipher.
Until 2005, the DST cipher (DST40) was a trade secret of Texas Instruments, made available to customers under non-disclosure agreement. This policy was likely instituted due to the cipher's non-standard design and small key size, which rendered it vulnerable to brute-force keysearch. In 2005, a group of students from the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute and RSA Laboratories reverse-engineered the cipher using an inexpensive Texas Instruments evaluation kit, through schematics of the cipher leaked onto Internet, and black-box techniques (i.e., querying transponders via the radio interface, rather than dismantling them to examining the circuitry). Once the cipher design was known, the team programmed several FPGA devices to perform brute-force key searches based on known challenge/response pairs. Using a single FPGA device, the team was able to recover a key from two known challenge/response pairs in approximately 11 hours (average case). With an array of 16 FPGA devices, they reduced this time to less than one hour.
DST40 is a 200-round unbalanced Feistel cipher, in which L0 is 38 bits, and R0 is 2 bits. The key schedule is a simple linear feedback shift register, which updates every three rounds, resulting in some weak keys (e.g., the zero key). Although the cipher is potentially invertible, the DST protocol makes use of only the encipher mode. When used in the protocol with the 40–24-bit output truncation, the resulting primitive is more aptly described as a Message Authentication Code rather than an encryption function. Although a truncated block cipher represents an unusual choice for such a primitive, this design has the advantage of precisely bounding the number of collisions for every single key value.
The DST40 cipher is one of the most widely used unbalanced Feistel ciphers in existence.
Reaction and fixes.
The vulnerability exposed by the Hopkins team indicates potential security threats to millions of vehicles which are protected using DST-based immobilizer systems, and to the Exxon-Mobil Speedpass system. The ideal solution to this problem is to replace the DST transponder in these systems with a device provisioned with a more robust cryptographic circuit utilizing a longer key length. However, the cost of recalling these security systems is prohibitively high, and-- as of October 2005-- neither Texas Instruments, Exxon-Mobil or any vehicle manufacturer has announced such a recall. Currently the most effective protections against this attack rely on user vigilance, e.g., protecting transponder keys, auditing Speedpass invoices for fraud, and optionally using a metallic shield (such as aluminum foil) to prevent unauthorized scanning of DST tags. This vulnerability has also spawned the creation of the RSA Blocker Tag and RFID Blocking Wallets.

Cry for a Shadow

"Cry for a Shadow" is an instrumental rock piece recorded by the Beatles on 22 June 1961. They recorded the song at Friedrich-Ebert-Halle, Hamburg-Harburg, Germany while they were performing as Tony Sheridan's backup band for a few tracks, under the moniker the Beat Brothers. It was written by George Harrison with John Lennon, as a parody of the Shadows style. (The Shadows, who backed Cliff Richard, were the biggest British instrumental rock & roll group at the time of the recording.) It imitates the lead guitar with typical Hank Marvin licks, the melodic bass fills, and even has an imitation during the second middle eight of the famous Jet Harris yell. It is the only Beatles track to be credited to Lennon and Harrison alone.
It was intended to be released as the B-side of "Why", another Sheridan song with the Beatles, but the record company chose to release another song instead. In early 1964, as the Beatles were gaining popularity, the record company Polydor decided to release it, with "Why" changed to the b-side. "Cry for a Shadow"'s original title was "Beatle Bop".
"Cry for a Shadow" was the only officially released Beatles single to feature Pete Best on drums.
It is also featured on The Beatles' First and as part of the "Anthology 1" compilation in 1995.
San Francisco new wave group Translator released a cover version of this song as a B-side in 1983. It is included in the cover version record "B-Sides the Beatles" by rock band the Smithereens.

Cuerdale Hoard

The Cuerdale Hoard is a hoard of more than 8,600 items, including silver coins, English and Carolingian jewellery, hacksilver and ingots. It was discovered on 15 May 1840 on the southern bank of a bend of the River Ribble, in an area called Cuerdale in South Ribble near to the city of Preston, Lancashire, England. The Cuerdale Hoard is the largest Viking silver hoard ever found outside Russia, and exceeds in number of pieces and weight any hoard found in Scandinavia or any other western areas settled by the Vikings.
The coins in the hoard are from three sources, represented in the proportions 5:1:1. Viking kingdoms of eastern England are represented in the largest portion; the other two portions are of Alfred's Wessex and of coins from foreign sources, which include Byzantine, Scandinavian, Islamic, Papal, North Italian and Carolingian mintings, many of which last are from Aquitaine, perhaps, Richard Hall suggests, acquired there in Viking raids of 898. 
Discovery.
The hoard was found by a group of workmen repairing the embankment of the river. It was in a lead box, which shows evidence of the hoard having been parcelled into small bags or packages. After discovery it was quickly recovered by the landowner's bailiffs, ensuring it remained together, though the workmen managed to keep a coin each. The remainder was declared treasure trove and handed to Queen Victoria as the Duke of Lancaster.
The Duchy passed it to the British Museum in London, where the bulk of it remains today. About 60 items selected from the hoard are held and displayed by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Some coins minted at Quentovic in northern France (possibly present-day Étaples) are held by the Château-musée de Boulogne-sur-Mer.
Origins.
It is believed the coins were buried between 903 and 910 AD, soon after the Vikings had been expelled from Dublin in 902. At this time the Ribble Valley was an important Viking route between the Irish Sea and York. The presence of large numbers of newly minted Norse coins from York and large amounts of Irish Norse bullion leads experts to believe this may have been a war chest belonging to Irish Norse exiles intending to reoccupy Dublin from the Ribble Estuary, but there have also been many other theories about its ownership and purpose.
In 1966 the numismatist M. Banks suggested that the hoard was not even buried by Vikings, although it was Viking treasure, or much of it was. Banks suggested that the Cuerdale Hoard might have been a gift to English churches suffering persecution in the areas called the Danelaw that were occupied by pagan Vikings. Since so many of the coins were apparently minted across the Channel, said Banks, they were probably a contribution from the Frankish Christians to their English brothers.
Many such mysteries surround the Cuerdale trove. Little archaeological investigation has yet been done of the site of Cuerdale Hall. Such an investigation might reveal why the hoard was buried in that location. The orientation of the old hall and roads and fields to the south suggests that a ford or bridge existed at the present near the site of Cuerdale Hall. Rob Curedale, a descendant of the De Keuerdale family, proposed an alternative theory that the hoard was buried by Sir Thomas de Molyneux who occupied Cuerdale Hall and raised an army of several thousand with help from Irish nobility to support Richard II. The treasure could have been several hundred years old when brought from an unknown location in Ireland at the direction of Richard II and buried at Cuerdale.
Other theories include that the silver was intended for a casting works in the vicinity. Remains of fortifications and moat suggest that a larger building once occupied the present site of Cuerdale Hall.
Folklore.
The existence of the hoard may have been known long before its eventual rediscovery. A local Preston-Lancashire tradition said that anyone who stood on the south bank of the Ribble at Walton-le-Dale, and looked upriver to Ribchester, would be within sight of the richest treasure in England. The Ribchester Helmet had been found as part of a Roman hoard in 1796.
Contexts.
The presence of the Vikings can be seen today in Preston through numerous place names. The Cuerdale Hoard is an example of the rich archaeology that exists around the Preston area and includes evidence of prehistoric and significant Roman history.
The hoard was number 9 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the British Museum for the 2003 BBC Television documentary "Our Top Ten Treasures" presented by Adam Hart-Davis.

Eleventh Dream Day

Eleventh Dream Day is an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois.
History.
The band was founded by guitarists Rick Rizzo and Janet Beveridge Bean, who met at a place fondly known as 1069. This was a house/practice space/hang out in Louisville where at the time, Beveridge Bean was practicing with the band she was in with Tara Key and Tim Harris; the Zoo Directors. After moving to Chicago, Bean and Rizzo joined with guitarist Baird Figi and bassist Doug McCombs; Bean soon switched over to drums. Their first self-titled EP in 1987 introduced the hallmarks of EDD's sound: Neil Young-inspired electric guitar workouts mixed with punk energy.
The band's full-length follow-up, "Prairie School Freakout" (1988), won critical praise and the attention of major labels. The band then signed with Atlantic Records. Follow-ups "Beet" (1989) and "Lived to Tell" (1991) won more strong reviews but did not sell many copies; Figi left during the "Lived to Tell" tour and was replaced by Matthew "Wink" O'Bannon. 
The band made a stab for commercial success with 1993's "El Moodio", but the effort was unsuccessful and Eleventh Dream Day was dropped from Atlantic's roster. O'Bannon left after recording 1994's "Ursa Major" and the band ceased to be a full-time entity; Rizzo went back to college to earn a degree in education, while Bean and McCombs concentrated on their other musical projects, Freakwater and Tortoise respectively. 
Eleventh Dream Day has since recorded new albums every few years, starting with 1997's "Eighth". Recent albums have balanced the band's Young-influenced approach with an interest in ambient sound, likely influenced by McCombs's work with Tortoise. EDD released "Stalled Parade" in 2000, playing a handful of shows after the album's release with Mark Greenberg of (the Coctails) assisting on keyboards and other instruments. "Zeroes and Ones" was released on April 25, 2006, on Thrill Jockey Records. "Riot Now!" was released on March 15, 2011, on Thrill Jockey Records.
"New Moodio", a forgotten alternate version of "El Moodio" recorded in 1991 with Brad Wood at Idful Studios, will be released for the first time two decades after the fact by Comedy Minus One in May 2013.

Shinomori Aoshi

, known in Western order as Aoshi Shinomori in the English version of the anime, is a fictional of the "Oniwabanshū" in the "Rurouni Kenshin" universe created by Nobuhiro Watsuki.
Design.
Nobuhiro Watsuki based Aoshi on Hijikata Toshizō, the deputy Leader of the Shinsengumi. There are most certainly versions of Hijikata portrayed in books and fiction; Aoshi grew out of the Hijikata who killed his gentler feelings and buried his human weakness. Watsuki describes himself as a fan of the other version of Hijikata. Watsuki describes that version of Hijikata, seen in "Moeyo Ken" ("Burn, O Sword"), as "a bundle of raw combat-instinct who keeps fighting until the very death." Since, according to Watsuki, the addition of the Oniwabanshū occurred during the "last minute," he found difficulty writing with him since he had not resolved a "concrete image" for Aoshi. Watsuki says that he used no specific design model for Aoshi. As the image of Hijikata grew stronger within Watsuki, the "Rurouni Kenshin" author added fringes (bangs) to Aoshi's design. Watsuki held a chance to change the hairstyle while compiling the edited manga, but chose not to edit the hairstyle, since he did not want readers to believe that "Aoshi was wearing a rug or anything." 
Watsuki said he originally intended for his design of the 13-year old "young Aoshi" to be used for another character. He says that many female readers liked young Aoshi. He described drawing Aoshi's fringes as "a pain." 
During the run of the Kyoto arc, Watsuki reported receiving a reader letter that said "I'll bet Aoshi is gonna be another one of those characters who "just" happens to be around to help Kenshin in times of need." The letter "kind of got to" Watsuki and he told himself that Aoshi is going to be a "bad guy." As a response Watsuki decided to make Aoshi an antagonist in the arc and fight Okina (Kashiwazaki Nenji), his former master.
Character outline.
Background.
Born in January 1853 in Tokyo Prefecture, Shinomori Aoshi was raised a ninja of the Oniwabanshū, who worked for the Shogunate government during the Edo period. At the suggestion of Kashiwazaki Nenji (better known as Okina), Shinomori was given the position of Okashira at the age of fifteen, in time for the Oniwabanshou to defend Edo Castle. He helped to raise Makimachi Misao from childhood as a member of the Oniwabanshū.
After the revolution, since a few members of the Oniwabanshū were unable to adapt to life in the Meiji era, Aoshi and these members worked for the corrupt, power-hungry business man, Takeda Kanryū instead. Aoshi's subordinates included Beshimi, who specialized in darts and poison; Hyottoko, whose name literally means "Fire Man" who breathes fire; Han'nya, a skilled martial artist and deft ninjutsu practitioner; and Shikijō, a scarred "muscle man".
Personality.
Shinomori Aoshi is a very quiet, intelligent individual. He never speaks when unnecessary and he always thinks before he acts. He seems to be unemotional most of the time, earning him the nickname of "that gloomy jerk" from Myōjin Yahiko. Aoshi only smiles once in the manga (excluding the times when he smirks) and around eight times in the anime (though no one sees him do so). He does not show it, but he has a soft spot reserved for his friends and Makimachi Misao.
Aoshi appears to be very cool and level headed when the readers and audiences first see him, although they see glimpses of his obsession to defeat Kenshin in a few scenes. After Han'nya, Shikijō, Beshimi, and Hyottoko die, and during the time Aoshi escapes from Kanryū's mansion, he seems to be in a shock, and his eyes have a shaded look, a conventional manga portrayal of depression, possession, or daydreaming. His intelligence and analytical skills are also well-honed evidenced from his display of narrowing the location of a mine below the water to a tenth of a degree and meter.
Techniques.
Aoshi is a grand master and Okashira of the Oniwanbanshou shinobi. Aoshi's weapon of choice is a kodachi, a sword that is described in the series to act like a shield because its light weight makes it easy to block with. He originally used only one of these short swords for defense outside of Kaiten Kenbu and relied mainly on ninjutsu for his offense, but later used a two-sworded style, employing a pair of the swords. When in their saya, they appear to be part of a single sheathed sword, one blade appearing to be the hilt, while the second blade is stationed opposite the first and blends in with the saya itself, giving it the impression of being a nodachi. A dangerous opponent, he uses his speed together with a mix of sword and hand-to-hand combat moves. His physical strength is extremely high, having once knocked Sanosuke out with one blow to the back of the neck in the anime, and break Suzaku's sword in his grip in the manga.
Plot overview.
While working with Kanryū as "muscle" in his opium manufacturing operation, Aoshi came face to face with Kenshin, who was trying to rescue Takani Megumi. During the confrontation with Kenshin, Aoshi revealed that he aims to kill Kenshin, who was formerly known as the famed Hitokiri Battōsai. After an intense fight, their battle ends with Aoshi's defeat when Aoshi is struck a second time to the throat by his own Kodachi after Kenshin narrowly escapes death by having his scabbard reduce the damage brought on by Aoshi's Kaiten Kenbu. Kanryū betrays Aoshi and kills his four subordinates with a Gatling gun while they die one after the other protecting Aoshi, and when Kenshin had gripped his sword Kanryu ran out of bullets (in the anime, Beshimi threw a dart into the ammo belt, which jammed, allowing Kenshin to get in close) and was soon struck by Kenshin's sakabato and arrested. After the deaths of his friends and team-mates, Aoshi became even more determined to defeat Kenshin, obsessed even, stating that it is the only thing he can do for his fallen comrades now, to obtain the title of the strongest and bring it before their graves as flower.
Determined to achieve his goal, Aoshi follows him to Kyoto after training intensely for a few months and narrowly missing him when Kenshin heads to Kyoto with Saito and Misao, and joins Shishio Makoto (despite initially rejecting the offer) in hopes of fighting Kenshin. He lets no one stand in his way, going as far as fighting and severely injuring Okina (Kenshin however later remarks that Aoshi subconsciously held back against his former comrade) to try to learn of Kenshin's whereabouts (but fails to get the location). Aoshi joins forces with Shishio Makoto and plans to kill Kenshin and then commit suicide.
Towards the end of the Kyoto Arc, the much-anticipated battle arrives and Kenshin fights Aoshi. Kenshin saves Aoshi from his own madness, as he realizes that death is not the answer to his situation. To put an end to the feud and see who is truly the strongest, both decide to use their strongest attacks resulting in Kenshin's victory. Even though Kenshin's ougi, Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki, activated after Aoshi's Kaiten Kenbu Rokuren (which was already cutting his neck), the sheer speed of the attack allowed it to strike first and incapacitate Aoshi. He later appears to fight against Shishio, though still weakened from Kenshin's Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki, yet he still managed to buy time for Kenshin, who had been knocked unconscious by Shishio, to get back on his feet.
Aoshi spends his time meditating in a temple, needing time to sort through what he has done and been through. Before Kenshin leaves Kyoto, he asks if Aoshi would like to share a drink (of sake) with him; Aoshi refuses the offer (saying that he does not drink), but goes on to say he would be willing to have tea with him when they meet again.
In the Jinchū Arc, Aoshi returns to Tokyo with Misao in order to deliver the diary of Yukishiro Tomoe to Kamiya Kaoru. They arrive to discover Kaoru is "dead," though Aoshi soon solves the mystery and reveals that the body buried of Kaoru was actually a doll, created by a man named Gein. Subsequently, he defeats Gein in the graveyard after the latter returns to try to retrieve his creation which he considers his masterpiece, and allows him to burn in the flames he himself started after telling him that Aoshi burned the doll as a sign of pity. Joining Kenshin and his friends as they travel to Yukishiro Enishi's island to rescue Kaoru. Aoshi defeats Suzaku, a master mimic who is one of the four Sushin bodyguards of Enishi's second in command before leaving Kenshin to fight Enishi. Following the battle, he and Misao return with the group to Tokyo, only for Aoshi to announce that he and Misao will return to Kyoto very soon because the high mountains where Aoshi buried the remains of his four comrades will hit winter before the plains do, and they will have to give them a finer resting place. Before leaving, he honors Kenshin's request in Kyoto by having a cup of tea with him.
Reception.
Daryl Surat of "Otaku USA" said that while, in Surat's view, Aoshi does not engage in "meaningful" battles, the character scored highly in popularity polls among readers because Aoshi appears "like a CLAMP character wearing Gambit's coat." Surat used Aoshi as an example of "Rurouni Kenshin" being a "neo-shonen" work that appeals to boy and girls.
In live-action film.
Yusuke Iseya is cast as Aoshi in two live-action sequels to "Rurouni Kenshin".

Alvin Ceccoli

Alvin Warren Ceccoli (born 5 August 1974 in Sydney, Australia) is an Australian footballer who played for three A-League clubs (Sydney FC, Central Coast Mariners and Adelaide United) and was capped internationally for Australia.
Club career.
Alvin Ceccoli is of Sammarinese heritage. Alvin started his National Soccer League (NSL) career at Wollongong Wolves in 1995 as a 21-year old. He played 156 matches in the National Soccer League, punctuated by a short stint in Greece with AEK Athens FC. He won successive NSL Championships with Wollongong in 1998/99 and 1999/2000 before joining Parramatta Power, becoming part of the losing grand final side in 2003/04.
He was one of seven players signed by Sydney FC from the defunct NSL. Ceccoli's first season at the glamour club was a rebirth for his career. Alvin not only became one of the strongest defenders in the league, but also earned his second national team cap against Bahrain in a qualifying match for the Asian Cup in 2007, as a reward for an excellent season with Sydney FC. During the second season with Sydney however, he had some disagreements with new coach Terry Butcher which soured his relationship with the club, and he sought a move elsewhere.
A transfer to Japanese second division team Avispa Fukuoka allowed him to reunite with former Sydney coach Pierre Littbarski, and was formally released by Sydney on 16 January 2007. He spent close to a year at Avispa and was released at the end of the season.
On 3 January 2008 Ceccoli signed a contract for the remainder of the A-League season with Central Coast Mariners FC as cover for Dean Heffernan, his contract running until after the 2008 Grand Final on 25 February. Ceccoli agreed on 20 January 2008 to sign with rival A-League club Adelaide United for their 2008 AFC Champions League campaign beginning in March. It would be his third A-League club in as many years, but was notably absent from Adelaide's first two ACL matches. On 20 March 2008 it was revealed he had left the club to return home to Wollongong to be close to his young family. Staying locally, he has joined Illawarra Premier League club Dandaloo FC for 2008.

Senjinkun military code

The was a pocket-sized military code issued to soldiers in the Imperial Japanese forces on 8 January 1941 in the name of then War Minister Hideki Tojo. It was in use at the outbreak of the Pacific War.
The "Senjinkun" was regarded as a supplement to the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors, which was already required reading for the Japanese military. It listed a number of exhortations regarding military regulations, combat readiness, esprit de corps, filial piety, veneration of Shinto "kami", and Japan's "kokutai". The code specifically forbade retreat or surrender. 　The quote "Never live to experience shame as a prisoner." was repeatedly cited as the cause of numerous suicides committed by soldiers and civilians.
Japanese soldiers were instructed to “show mercy to those who surrender”. This was written in response to prior misconduct on the battlefield.
Towards the end of the war, copies of the "Senjinkun" were also distributed to the civilian population of Japan as part of the preparation for Operation Downfall, the expected invasion of the Japanese home islands by Allied forces.

A similar military code titled "Precepts Concerning the Decisive Battle" was issued by War Minister Korechika Anami on 1945-04-08. The "Precepts" stipulated that Imperial Japanese Army officers and men should:

Precordial examination

In medicine, the precordial exam, also cardiac exam, is performed as part of a physical examination, or when a patient presents with chest pain suggestive of a cardiovascular pathology. In reality it's unlikely that this examination would be performed in isolation or in its entirety outside of a medical examination. It would typically be modified depending on the indication and integrated with other examinations especially the respiratory examination.
Like all medical examinations, the precordial examination follows the standard structure of inspection, palpation and auscultation.
Positioning.
The patient is positioned in the supine position tilted up at 45 degrees if the patient can tolerate this. The head should rest on a pillow and the arms by their sides. The level of the jugular venous pressure (JVP) should only be commented on in this position as flatter or steeper angles lead to artificially elevated or reduced level respectively. Also, left ventricular failure leads to pulmonary edema which increases and may impede breathing if the patient is laid flat.
Lighting should be adjusted so that it is not obscured by the examiner who will approach from the right hand side of the patient as is medical custom.
The torso and neck should be fully exposed and access should be available to the legs.
Inspection.
General Inspection:
Inspect the hands for:
Inspect the head for:
Then inspect the precordium for:
Palpation.
The pulses should be palpated, first the radial pulse commenting on rate and rhythm then the brachial pulse commenting on character and finally the carotid pulse again for character.
The pulses may be:
Palpation of the precordium.
The valve areas are palpated for abnormal pulsations (palpable heart murmurs known as "thrills") and precordial movements (known as "heaves"). Heaves are best felt with the heel of the hand at the sternal border.
Palpation of the apex beat.
The apex beat is found approximately in the 5th intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. It can be impalpable for a variety of reasons including obesity, emphysema, effusion and rarely dextrocardia. The apex beat is assessed for size, amplitude, location, impulse and duration. There are specific terms to describe the sensation such as tapping, heaving and thrusting.
Often the apex beat is felt diffusely over a large area, in this case the most inferior and lateral position it can be felt in should be described as well as the location of the largest amplitude.
Finally the sacrum and ankles are checked for pitting edema which is caused by right ventricular in isolation or as part of congestive cardiac failure.
Auscultation.
One should comment on
Completion of examination.
To complete the exam blood pressure should be checked, an ECG recorded, funduscopy performed to assess for Roth spots or papilledema. A full peripheral circulation exam should be performed.

David Carney

David Raymond Carney (born 30 November 1983) is an Australian football (soccer) Midfielder, currently playing with A-League side Newcastle Jets FC until the end of the 2013-14 season. Born in Sydney, he began his playing career with the New South Wales Institute of Sport before moving to England to join Everton. Having failed to break into the Everton first team he then moved to Oldham Athletic, Halifax Town and Hamilton Academical in Scotland before returning to his native Australia. After a successful spell with Sydney FC, Carney then returned to England, signing with Sheffield United before spending time with Norwich City on loan and eventually moving to the Netherlands to play for Twente. He subsequently had spells with Blackpool, AD Alcorcón, Bunyodkor and New York as well as making 48 sppearances for the Australia national side for whom he scored six goals.
Career.
Junior career.
Sydney-born Carney attended Robert Townson Primary School in Campbelltown, New South Wales. At the age of 16, Carney moved to England after impressing in a trial match and signing for Everton. There he played in various youth and reserve teams alongside Manchester United star Wayne Rooney, most notably at the 2002 FA Youth Cup final. After not securing a permanent contract at Everton F.C., he left the club in 2003. David Moyes told Carney upon releasing him "...sometimes you need to take one step back to take another one forward." He had brief stints on month-to-month contracts at Oldham Athletic and Hamilton Academical before electing to return to Australia.
Sydney FC.
Carney trialled for newly formed A-League side Sydney FC in March 2005 and was signed to a one-year deal after impressing coach Pierre Littbarski. He was an immediate success at the club, scoring twice at the Club World Championship Australian Qualifying Tournament, including the only goal of the final, and again at the Oceania Club Championship to help ensure the club's qualification for the Club World Championship. On 16 December 2005, Carney scored the winning goal against African champions El Ahly to secure Sydney FC 5th place at the tournament.
In the 2005–06 A-League season, Carney was an essential part of Sydney FC's success. He made 24 appearances (22 starts), scoring 6 goals and creating a further 6 assists. His dribbling and occasional goal poaching made Carney a genuine crowd favourite at Sydney FC and he subsequently attracted the attention of a number of clubs in Europe.
Overseas trials.
Carney's initial contract expired at the end of the 2006 season, and after strong rumours linking a move to Romanian club FC Steaua Bucureşti, he was offered trials in Germany at Bundesliga side Mönchengladbach and promoted second division club Alemannia Aachen. Despite scoring twice in a trial match and being offered a deal by Aachen he decided against signing for the club, citing ""the language factor"" as the main reason for declining the move.
2006–2007 season.
He remained loyal to Sydney FC and re-signed for another season. A shoulder injury required surgery and sidelined him for the early part of the season. He made 14 appearances (12 starts), scoring one goal and providing 2 assists. Carney played in Sydney FC's appearances in the AFC Champions League and his good form was rewarded with selection in the Australian national football team to play a friendly match against Uruguay in Sydney, and in the AFC Asian Cup tournament in Thailand and Malaysia.
Sheffield United.
Carney joined English Championship side Sheffield United in August 2007 for a transfer fee of A$125,000. Carney played 90 minutes in each of Sheffield United's first two Football League Cup ties, setting up two goals. He made his first starting appearance in the Championship for Sheffield United in a 2–0 defeat at Bristol City on 6 October 2007. These performances and his displays in the Australian national team reportedly led to interest from German clubs Bayern Munich, VfL Bochum and Kaiserslautern; and a £2.3 million bid from Belgian champions Anderlecht.
Carney steered Sheffield United past Barclays Premier League side Bolton, securing a position in the fourth round of the FA Cup, with the only goal of the third round tie. Having been rested for the fourth round tie with Manchester City, Carney scored the equaliser for the Blades in their league match against Watford in January 2008 followed by a slick finish for the equaliser at Colchester United in the same week before flying out to Melbourne for Australia's first World Cup qualifier on 6 February.
Since Kevin Blackwell became manager of Sheffield United in February 2008, Carney was "effectively frozen out of the first team." In August 2009, it was speculated that Blackwell was so eager to leave Carney out of the first team that he named a squad one substitute short, despite Carney recently scoring a cracking goal whilst on international duty.
Norwich City.
In January 2009 Carney joined Norwich City on loan until the end of the season, becoming Bryan Gunn's first signing as Norwich manager. Carney would link up again with new first-team coach Ian Crook, with whom he worked at Sydney FC. Carney made his first appearance for the club coming on as a substitute in the 3–3 away draw to Wolves on 3 February.
FC Twente.
In August 2009 Sheffield United agreed to the sale of Carney to Dutch Eredivisie side FC Twente in what was reported to be a two-year deal with a third year extension option.
Shoulder surgery in December 2009 restricted Carney's number of appearances but he recovered in time to be fit for the end of the season in which the club won the Dutch League title for the first time in their history. In August 2010, Carney played in FC Twente's 1–0 win over Ajax to win the Dutch Super Cup.
Blackpool.
On 1 September 2010, Carney signed a one-year deal with a further year option at Blackpool in the Premier League. He made his Premier League debut on 11 September 2010, coming off the bench in the 85th minute, helping Blackpool to a 2–0 win at Newcastle United at St James' Park. Carney got his first start in the Premier League against Aston Villa on 10 November. He left Blackpool at the end of his contract with Blackpool after they were relegated to the Championship.
AD Alcorcón.
In October 2011 Carney joined Spanish Segunda División club AD Alcorcón on a one-year deal. Carney made his debut for the club in a league match against Gimnàstic de Tarragona. After failing to hold down a first team spot he mutually terminated his contract with the club.
Bunyodkor.
On 10 February 2012, Carney joined Uzbek League team FC Bunyodkor on trial. On 18 February 2012, the club signed Carney to play in the 2012 Uzbek League, which runs from March to September with a possible return to the A-league for the 2012–13 season. Carney made his debut for Bunyodkor in their 2–1 defeat to Adelaide United in the AFC Champions League on 6 March playing for 64 minutes. Carney made his league debut for Bunyodkor on 26 March, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Shavkat Salomov in their 2–2 draw against Qizilqum Zarafshon. Carney scored his first goal for Bunyodkor in their 3–1 victory over Metallurg Bekabad on 26 April. On 18 September, it was revealed that Carney was deemed surplus to requirements at Bunyodkor with the coach citing that performances at club level were not as good as performances for the national team. It was finally confirmed on 29 September, that Carney was released from the club after spending weeks without playing for the team and chasing money owed to him. Following his release, Carney's agent believed he would sign for a Championship side in England.
New York Red Bulls.
Carney signed with Major League Soccer club New York Red Bulls on 8 August 2013, a move that reunited him with Australian international teammate Tim Cahill. Carney left Red Bulls on 25 November 2013, after they declined to take up the option to extend the contract.
Newcastle Jets.
On 2 February 2014, Carney signed with Newcastle Jets FC in the A-League until the end of the 2013–14 season.
International career.
Carney made the Australian squad for the trip to Bahrain in February 2006 to play in the Socceroos first ever match in Asia, and made his full début as a second half substitute. Carney played in his second full international against Kuwait in Sydney, Australia in August 2006. Carney played a full game in the Socceroos 3–0 win over Qatar in their first 2010 World Cup qualifier on 6 February 2008.
Carney chose to play for Australia in the 2008 Olympic Games, rather than staying in the UK to concentrate on the forthcoming season with Sheffield United, putting a question mark over his future at Bramall Lane.
2007 Asian Cup.
During the Asian Cup championship, Carney was selected to play in the starting line-up for Australia against co-host nation Thailand in the final game of the group matches. Australia won 4–0 and advanced to the quarter finals of the competition, where they faced Japan. Carney played from start to finish in the Asian Cup quarter final, a match that ended 1–1 after 90 minutes, and remained the same score after 30 minutes of extra time. Japan won 4–3 after penalties were taken to break the deadlock with Carney striking Australia's third and final penalty goal. During the Asian Cup, Carney was played at left full back, impressing in both matches. He subsequently played in left back in Australia's 1–0 defeat against Argentina in September 2007. In his next international, against Nigeria in November 2007, Carney scored from 30 yards to give the Socceroos a 1–0 win.
In June 2009, Carney was an impressive figure in the team that beat Bahrain to secure qualification to the World Cup Finals in 2010. He scored the second goal in their 2–0 victory in Sydney and was then rested for the final group game against Japan in Melbourne the following week due to being on a yellow card.
On 12 August 2009, Carney played in the Australian side that comprehensively beat the Republic of Ireland 3–0 in Limerick. Carney scored the third goal of the game with a stunning 35-yard drive into the top corner.
2010 FIFA World Cup.
Carney was selected in the 23-man squad to play at the FIFA 2010 World Cup in South Africa for the Socceroos. Carney appeared in the World Cup playing in their Group match against Ghana in which they drew 1–1 and their 2–1 victory against Serbia.
2011 Asian Cup.
Carney started for Australia in the left-back position for the 2011 Asian Cup in Qatar. In the final against Japan, a joint error made by Carney in extra-time allowed Japanese player Tadanari Lee to volley the winning goal.
Carney scored his sixth International goal for Australia in their 2–1 victory against Germany in Monchengladbach on Tuesday 29 March.
Player of the season.
Australian magazine FourFourTwo named Carney as the Socceroo's Player of the Season for 2007–08 ahead of established Premiership players Tim Cahill, Harry Kewell, Lucas Neill and Mark Viduka.

This Is How a Heart Breaks

"This Is How a Heart Breaks" was released in June 2005 as the second single from Matchbox Twenty frontman Rob Thomas's debut album, "…Something to Be". The song was moderately successful on the charts peaking at number 52 in the USA and number 13 in Australia. It was certified gold by the RIAA selling over 500,000 copies and in 2006 it won a Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo.
In popular culture.
The song was used during the 2005 NBA Finals by ABC television.
Video and plot.
The video, directed by Pedro Romhanyi, starts off with images of New York City then Thomas singing as he walks along the street. Then suddenly, he sees someone and runs away, chased by that person through the New York streets. Later on, Thomas escapes from the chaser and sings a few lines while walking along another part of the street. Just as he finishes his lines, the chaser catches up to Thomas again and he runs through a bar and jumps out a window in the bar. Eventually, Thomas loses the chaser and goes into an elevator in a building. Once he leaves, he runs up the stairs to the fire exit and when gets to the roof top he sings some lines then sees the chaser chasing him again. As the chase continues Thomas tries to climb down a fire escape only to fall into trash. Then Thomas runs on top of some parked cars only to run into a fence which he can't climb. Then Thomas gets cornered and finds himself face to face with the chaser. As the video ends we get a very quick glimpse of the chaser's face and it is in fact himself, Rob Thomas.

Muchukunda

Muchukunda, son of King Mandhata, was born in the Ikshvaku dynasty. Ikshvaku dynasty is also known as Suryavamsha. The important kings of this dynasty are Harishchandra, Dileepa, Raghu and Sri Rama.
Battle with the Asuras.
Once, in a battle, the deities were defeated by the demons. Tormented by arrows, they sought help from king Muchukunda. King Muchukunda agreed to help them and fought against the demons for a long time. Since the deities did not have an able commander, king Muchukunda protected them against the demonic onslaught, until the deities got an able commander like Kartikeya, the son of Lord Shiva. Then Indra said to the king Muchukunda, "O king, we, the deities are indebted to you for the help and protection which you have given us, by sacrificing your own family life. Here in the heaven, one year equals three hundred and sixty years of the earth. Since, it has been a long time, there is no sign of your kingdom and family because it has been destroyed with the passage of time. We are happy and pleased with you, so ask for any boon except Moksha(liberation) because Moksha(liberation) is beyond our capacities".
Muchkunda asks Indra for a boon to sleep. While fighting on the side of the deities, king Muchukunda did not get an opportunity to sleep even for a moment. Now, since his responsibilities were over, overcome by tiredness, he was feeling very sleepy. So, he said, "O King of the deities, I want to sleep. Anyone who dares to disturb my sleep should get burnt to ashes immediately".
Indra said, "So be it, go to the earth and enjoy your sleep, one who awakens you would be reduced to ashes".
After this, king Muchukunda descended to earth and selected a cave, where he could sleep without being disturbed.
Kalayavan's death.
Kalayavan, the great Yavana warrior king, was killed by Muchukunda's gaze in the Indian epic "Mahābhārata".
Kalayavan was undefeated and unmatched in battle due to a boon, but he was also merciless and cruel.
He learns that Krishna is the only person who can defeat him in battle and accepting this challenge sets out to invade Krishna's kingdom, Mathura. When the two armies faced each other in battle, Krishna dismounts from his chariot and starts walking away, followed by Kalayavan. After a long time Krishna, followed by Kalayavan, enters a dark cave. In this cave Muchukunda was sleeping since the time he was blessed by king of deities.
The person on whom Muchkunda's gaze falls is doomed to instantaneous death. Kalayavan in a fit of anger and unable to see in the dark attacks Muchukunda mistaking him to be Krishna. When Muchkunda opens his eyes, his gaze falls on Kalayavan who is immediately burnt to death.
According to Hinduism, Muchukunda was an ancestor of Sri Rama, who belonged to Tretha Yuga. Sri Krishna appears towards the end of Dwapara Yuga. So, Muchukunda is asleep for a long time. After he woke up, he saw Sri Krishna and was delighted. Sri Krishna advised him to perform Tapas to cleanse the accumulated sins. Sri Krishna told him that his next life would be his last life. After that, he would get Moksha (liberation). Then, Muchukunda came out of the cave. He was astonished to see the size of various beings. The size of all creatures had shrunken due to evolution during the longtime that he was alseep. Then Muchukunda went to north to Gandamadana Mountain and from there to Badrika Ashrama.
Muchikunda River.
The Muchkunda river i.e.Musi River is a tributary of Krishna River in the Deccan Plateau region of Andhra Pradesh state in India. It flows through a major portion of Hyderabad, India and divides the historic old city with the new city. It was known as Muchukunda river in olden days, this name was changed to Musi,which name is still in use today. The reason for change of original name "Muchukunda" is not known.

Pericardial friction rub

A pericardial friction rub, also pericardial rub, is an audible medical sign used in the diagnosis of pericarditis. Upon auscultation, this sign is an extra heart sound of to-and-fro character, typically with three components, one systolic and two diastolic. It resembles the sound of squeaky leather and often is described as grating, scratching, or rasping. The sound seems very close to the ear and may seem louder than or may even mask the other heart sounds. The sound usually is best heard between the apex and sternum but may be widespread.
Cause.
The pericardium is a double-walled sac around the heart. The inner and outer (visceral and parietal, respectively) layers are normally lubricated by a small amount of pericardial fluid, but the inflammation of pericardium causes the walls to rub against each other with audible friction. In children, rheumatic fever is often the cause of pericardial friction rub. 
Differential diagnosis.
Pericardial friction rub is one of several, similar sounds. A differential diagnosis may be possible, or not, depending upon the number of components that are audible. Pericardial friction rub may have one, two, or three audible components, whereas the similar pleural friction rub ordinarily has two audible components. One- and two-component rubs are ambiguous. A three-component rub distinguishes a pericardial rub and indicates the presence of pericarditis. Also, a pleural rub can only be heard during inspiration and expiration, whereas, the pericardial rub can be heard even after cessation of breathing. Pleural rub creates pain mostly on the lateral part of the chest wall, whereas pain due to pericardial rub is always central in location. The intensity of pleural rub is increased on pressing the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the affected area, whereas there is no such change in case of a pericardial rub.

Styx and Stone

Styx and Stone (Jacob Eishorn and Gerald Stone) are two fictional comic book characters in the Marvel Comics universe. They are a criminal duo that have crossed Spider-Man's path on a number of occasions. They were created by David Michelinie and Todd McFarlane and first appeared in "The Amazing Spider-Man" #309. They reappeared in issues #332-333 and #376-377 of the same series.
Fictional character biography.
Gerald Stone was an idealistic scientist who wanted to find a cure for cancer. He conducted an illegal experiment on a homeless person named Jacob Eishorn. The experiment failed and Eishorn became a living cancer, who needed to kill to survive. Now calling himself "Styx", Eishorn enjoyed the killing of innocents. Feeling responsible for Styx, Stone built high-tech weaponry for himself and turned the two of them into a mercenary duo. Stone hoped that as mercenaries, Styx wouldn't kill innocents, but by now Stone was willing to kill anybody to protect Styx. He planned on using the money they earned as mercenaries to find a cure for Styx.
On their first outing, the duo was hired by Johathon Caesar, a millionaire obsessed with Mary Jane Watson to kidnap her. This brought them into conflict with Spider-Man, Mary Jane's husband, who defeated the duo. Styx and Stone returned to Caesar, who told them to try again. This time, the duo faced Spider-Man who was at the time in conflict with Venom. During the fight, Styx's touch nearly killed Venom and they were returned to prison.
A third meeting with Spider-Man involved the vigilante Cardiac. Cardiac's alter-ego, Dr. Elias Wirtham, had been a good friend of Stone and offered to cure Styx. Cardiac was convinced that Styx couldn't be cured or redeemed and tried to kill Styx. Spider-Man stopped Cardiac and the two fought, while Styx and Stone attempted, in vain, to escape.
Powers and abilities.
Styx's touch can kill anything organic and can disintegrate organic matter within seconds. His fingers can grow longer to increase his range. His touch has no effect on synthetic or inorganic material and Spider-Man's synthetic costume was enough to protect his body from Styx's touch.
Stone wears two large weapons on his shoulders. These weapons can fire energy blasts, a blinding flash, a sticky resin to immobilize opponents and knockout gas. The duo often uses a flying platform of Stone's design.
Other versions.
Ultimate Marvel.
A teenage version of Styx and Stone appears in the Ultimate Marvel universe as a street punk and a member of the Serpent Skulls gang.

KTXX-FM

KTXX-FM (104.9 FM, "The Horn") is an American radio station licensed to serve the community of Bee Cave, Texas. The station broadcasts a sports radio and classic hits format to the Austin, Texas area. The Genuine Austin Radio outlet broadcasts at 104.9 MHz with an ERP of 3,200 watts. Its transmitter is located in Bee Cave, Texas, and the station has studios along Loop 360 in Southwest Austin.
History.
The station was the original home to "Digital 104.9" with the callsign KXXS. In February 2007, that format and callsign moved to 92.5, to make room for rhythmic contemporary station KXBT The Beat as "Beat 104.9". This was the third incarnation of "The Beat", as it originally launched on 104.3 in 1998 as KQBT, although it took on KXBT on the same freqency after a six-month format hiatus there. The format moved from 104.3 due to a change in ownership when Entercom sold that frequency to Univision, only in the interim after CBS Radio (formerly Infinity Broadcasting) sold it to Entercom. The staff and lineup from "The Beat" was still intact, even though new owner Entercom indeed let them go and was hired by Border Media Partners (BMP).
On September 26, 2008, BMP announced that KXBT will flip to Spanish CHR. On September 29, 2008, KXBT became a simulcast of KXXS, allowing them to now cover the entire Austin metro with KXBT serving the western portion and KXXS covering the eastern part of the area. The simulcast was called "Digital 104.9 y 92.5". The "Digital" simulcast would be broken up in mid-2009, when 104.9 flipped to Regional Mexican. The Spanish CHR format was retained on 92.5. "The Beat" has since been resurrected by Clear Channel where it aired on KFMK and later KPEZ to date.
On November 2, 2009, KHHL swapped call letters from sister station KTXX 103.1 Karnes City, Texas followed by a format change sports, branded as "104.9 The Horn". The brand is a tribute to the University of Texas at Austin sports team, the Texas Longhorns.
On January 2, 2014, the ESPN Radio brand was dropped and the station became a hybrid of sports talk and classic hits. Morning and afternoon drive, as well as the noon hour, remained local sports talk, while the other non-sporting event hours became classic hits. On May 5, 2014, more sports talk was added during the weekday and the station now has sports talk from 6 AM-7 PM and classic hits the rest of the time, unless a sporting event or specialty program is being broadcast. "The Horn" remains as the station's brand.
The original KTXX calls originate from KTXX 92.5 (now KRPT) Devine, Texas (1985-2003).

The Gift (The Jam album)

The Gift is the sixth and final studio album by British band The Jam. Released on 12 March 1982, it reached No. 1 on the British charts. Clocking in at 32:17 minutes, the album received a mixed reception from critics and fans.
The original release of the album was on 12" vinyl, and initial copies came with a paper bag stating "The Jam... A Gift". These copies are increasingly difficult to find, especially in good condition. Other issues included the regular vinyl issue, the Japanese vinyl issue (with a bonus lyric book), the CD issue, the re-mastered issue, and a recently issued Japanese version in a mini-LP style sleeve.
The album moved away from the simple three-chord music of "In the City" and "This Is the Modern World", and the more melodic "All Mod Cons", "Setting Sons" and "Sound Affects", to demonstrate Weller's love of northern soul. Funk bass lines and wah-wah guitar effects were often used throughout the album, along with jazz influences such as brass sections and saxophone solos (most notably on the track "Precious") and "Trans-Global Express" which was based on the Northern Soul funk hit "So Is The Sun" by World Column, lifting the chorus and rhythm line in their entirety from that song. Only two songs on the album exceed three and a half minutes.
The biggest hit of the album was "Town Called Malice". The song's lyrics are an accurate reflection of English working-class life at the time, and deal with small-town issues such as recreational drinking, the struggle to make a living, unemployment and lack of facilities in small towns.
"Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?", which was released as a 7" vinyl single in the Netherlands only, represents the efforts put in by 9-to-5 working men and women of Britain, who keep society running (and as such, are unsung heroes). Unlike the earlier song "Mr. Clean" from "All Mod Cons", Weller does not mock the character, but rather praises him/her. However, the character from "Mr. Clean" represents a completely different strata of society, the executive/upper management types who would typically hound and otherwise make the character from "Just Who Is The 5 O'Clock Hero?"'s life difficult.
Weller's experimentation of several different musical styles previously unexplored by The Jam on this album led to increasing disagreement with the other band members, Bruce Foxton and Rick Buckler, who were disillusioned with the move away from a traditional pub rock or punk rock style. The band broke up after touring the album (even after its massive success, rising to No. 1 on the British charts) on the 'Trans-Global Express Tour'.
After the album's release, Paul Weller went on to form The Style Council. The song "Carnation" was later covered by Liam Gallagher of Oasis and Steve Cradock of Ocean Colour Scene.
A 2-disc deluxe edition was released in 2012 for the album's 30th anniversary.

Shabolovskaya (Moscow Metro)

Shabolovskaya () is a station on the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line of the Moscow Metro. Though the station itself was built along with the rest of the Kaluzhskaya Line in 1962, problems with the escalator shaft postponed its opening until November 6, 1980. During the 18 intervening years the appearance of the platform was modernized, so it does not appear similar to the other 1960s stations on the line.
Shabolovskaya has pylons punctuated on all four faces by projecting piers and faced with white marble. The piers on the transverse faces of the pylons extend upward into the vaulted ceiling. The outer walls are clad in incongruously dark corrugated metal which contrasts sharply with the bright white of the ceiling and pylons. At the end of the platform is a backlit stained-glass panel on the theme of radio and television broadcasting. The station was designed by I.G. Petukhova, V.P. Kachurinets, N.I. Demchinsky, and Yu.A. Kolesnikova.
Shabolovskaya's entrance vestibule is on Ulitsa Shabolovka south of the intersection with Ulitsa Akademika Petrovskogo.

<doc id="2859099" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2859099" title="Mark Rudan">
Mark Rudan

Mark Rudan (born 27 August 1975) is an Australian former footballer and current head coach of National Premier Leagues NSW side Sydney United 58.
Club career.
Rudan joined NSL club Sydney United in 1993 at completion of the AIS program. He spent much of his five seasons at United totalling 73 NSL appearances by the end of the 1997–98 season. He was signed to new club Northern Spirit for the 1998–99 NSL season. In the first match of the season he was sent off. After serving a one-match suspension, he made amends in Round 3 scoring twice in a 2–1 win. He went on to start almost all matches that year, although saw red again in Round 16 (also against Olympic). Spirit finished fifth, but were eliminated in the first semi-final stage. Rudan was again a key figure in the 1999–00 season, playing 22 games, a less successful year for the club, slumping to the bottom half of the table.
Overseas.
In mid-2000, unhappy with his situation at Spirit, Rudan bought out the remainder of his contract and moved to German second division club Alemannia Aachen on a free transfer. Eligibility for a Croatian passport ensured he could play in Europe. The move started well on the pitch, working his way into the first team, but he would later become embroiled in a corruption scandal known as the 'suitcase affair'. In 2001, allegations of financial irregularity arose over the transfers of Rudan and fellow Australian Goran Lozanovski. Rudan was arrested by German authorities and later released. Charges were eventually laid on Aachen's treasurer Bernd Krings, who was convicted of financial fraud. It was revealed that persons claiming to represent Rudan and Northern Spirit collected DM290,000 in a suitcase from Aachen as a transfer fee. Documents outlining the transfer fee were shown to be falsified as Spirit neither requested or received any fee for the player. Similar circumstances were revealed surrounding Lozanovski's transfer from South Melbourne, but both players were cleared of any wrongdoing.
Rudan returned to on-field matters but unable to settle in the team, he and the club sought to part ways. After rumoured transfers to other German clubs, he was released by Aachen in January 2002. He continued on to a spell at Nanjing Yoyo in the Chinese first-division, before returning to Australia to link up again with Sydney United. Now a seasoned player with international experience, Rudan appeared regularly for the NSL club throughout the 2002–03 calendar but could not help them reach the finals round. He cemented his place in the team for the next (and ultimately last) NSL season. After missing the first match through injury, Rudan played every remaining game for United that year. With the Australian league collapsing he again sought a move overseas, joining Public Bank in the new Malaysian Super League, where he won the defender of the year award helping his team achieve its best ever finish to a season in 2nd place.
Sydney FC.
Sydney FC's formation as a new club in 2005 for the new A-League included enticing Australians playing abroad to return home. Mark was signed into the inaugural squad and honoured as club captain. It was not until late in the season he found better form, playing solidly in the last regular season matches and scoring the winner against in the semi-final second-leg, and Sydney went on to win the final and became the inaugural A-League Champions.
Yorke's departure as the 2006–07 season started, saw Rudan reinstated as captain but the year started on a low as Mark was sent off after just 14 minutes against in the second match of the new season.
On 15 December 2007, Rudan farewelled a home crowd of 12,530 following their 4–2 defeat to Perth Glory. Popovic handed his captaincy back to Rudan for this final game. His time at Sydney FC was extremely successful. He is remembered as the clubs first Footballing Legend as more than 4000 fans waited outside the stadium singing his name after the game in acknowledgement of his achievements for the club.
Avispa Fukuoka.
In December 2007, Rudan signed a deal with J. League side Avispa Fukuoka, linking up with his former coach of Sydney FC Pierre Littbarski and replacing former teammate Alvin Ceccoli.
FC Vaduz.
On 6 January 2009, Rudan signed for Axpo Super League (Switzerland 1st division) team FC Vaduz, based in Liechtenstein on a free transfer. The contract ran until 30 June 2010. He again linked up with his former manager at Avispa Fukuoka.
Adelaide United.
On 6 August 2009, before the start of the 2009–10 A-League season, Rudan joined Adelaide United on a one-year contract. Despite this, United announced he would not play against Perth Glory on 7 August in the Reds' first game of the new season. He left Adelaide after their final group game in the AFC Champions League as he announced his retirement as a player, and intends to move into coaching.
International career.
Rudan's footballing talent was first recognised in 1992 as he was granted a place in the AIS program, aimed at developing players for national youth teams. He joined the Young Socceroos squad for a South American tour in 1993, including a youth tournament mostly including club sides. Rudan was made vice captain to Mark Viduka in Australia's undefeated Youth World Cup qualifying campaign and scored the only goal of the Oceania final against New Zealand. As part of the squad for the 1995 Youth World Cup, Rudan played three of Australia's four matches including their second round exit in extra time at the hands of Portugal. He progressed his way into the national under-23 team and played most matches qualifying for the Olympics in Atlanta.
Coaching career.
After his short stint at Adelaide United and the announcement of his professional retirement as a player, Rudan moved into coaching, becoming the first grade coach for first division NSW club, Rockdale City Suns in 2011.
In 2013, Rudan departed from Rockdale City Suns and was appointed head coach of Sydney United 58. In his first season, Rudan helped win the inaugural season of the National Premier Leagues with his old club.
Personal life.
Rudan once featured in an episode of an Australian version of The Biggest Loser TV show, airing on 28 February 2006. Rudan was manager of the "Blue team" of contestants. Then Sydney FC teammate Dwight Yorke was manager of the red team. He is of Croat origin.
Since retiring from football, Rudan has joined Fox Sports as a pundit for their football coverage. Rudan currently features on Matchday Saturday and Fox Sports's weekly A-League highlights show.
Rudan's elder sister Mariana is a presenter on Australian football program The World Game.

Frazier Chorus

Frazier Chorus were a pop group from Brighton, England. A pop group without the usual guitarist, bassist or drummer; they instead utilised flute, clarinet, bongos and hushed vocals.
History.
Originally a four-piece, they signed to British indie record label 4AD and released the single "Sloppy Heart" in 1987. Shortly afterwards they moved to Virgin Records, and achieved reasonable chart success with a string of melodic pop songs about Dream Kitchens, Happy Eaters and Little Chefs, all taken from their 1989 debut album, "Sue". 
With the emergence of the indie-dance scene in the early 1990s the band changed tack. Singles from their second album "Ray" were remixed into indie-dance floorfillers by a number of top remixers, including Paul Oakenfold, Chad Jackson and Youth. The band were restyled from the fey indie pop band of 1989 into an act more like The Beloved and If?.
Singer Tim Freeman released a third album billed as Frazier Chorus ("Wide Awake"), which did not reach the UK Albums Chart, although it was released years after "Ray" on a small independent record label, while Kate Holmes moved into electronica via the bands Sirenes, Technique, and Client.
Tim Freeman is the brother of actor Martin Freeman, whose character "Tim Canterbury" in "The Office" was based on his sibling.

Van Valkenburgh was also the judge who sentenced Carl Glesser, a naturalized American citizen of German birth and publisher of the "Missouri Staats-Zeitung," to five years in Leavenworth after Glesser had pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act for thirteen articles he had published. Glesser began serving his sentence on April 30, 1918.
Moreover, Van Valkenburgh presided over the May 1918 trial of socialist activist Rose Pastor Stokes for alleged violation of the Espionage Act through speaking against war profiteering. Although Stokes proclaimed that she had "at all times recognized the cause of our entrance into the war" and "at no time opposed the war," Stokes was found guilty at trial and Van Valkenburg delivered a draconian sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, declaring Stokes to be "part of a systematic program to create discontent with the war" and to advance the cause of revolution.
Appeals Court Judge.
Van Valkenburgh was nominated by President Calvin Coolidge as Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on March 18, 1925. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate and received commission that same day.
During his tenure as a Circuit Judge Van Valkenburgh participated in the decisions of more than 500 cases and wrote some 170 opinions. Important among these were:
Death and legacy.
Arba Seymour Van Valkenburgh died on November 4, 1944, in Kansas City, Missouri. He and his wife did not have children. Judge Van Valkenburgh was devastated at the death of his wife, and commissioned a memorial stained glass window from the surviving Tiffany glass firm, Louis C. Tiffany Studios Corporation, for the cathedral church of the Episcopal Diocese of West Missouri, Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral, located in Kansas City, Missouri. It was dedicated on February 3, 1935.

Tirschenreuth

Tirschenreuth is the capital city of the district of Tirschenreuth. It is located in the northeast of Bavaria, very close to the Czech-Bavarian border.
Geography.
Tirschenreuth is located in the north of Upper Palatinate administrative region, around 75 miles north of Regensburg and 35 miles east of Bayreuth.
Incorporations.
The following villages were incorporated in Tirschenreuth
History.
Until the German Mediatisation in 1803 Tirschenreuth was part of the possessions of the Cistercian Abbey Waldsassen.
It received its town charter from Waldsassen's abbot Johann V. in 1364.
Originally the Waldsassen Abbey and its possessions were immediately subordinate to the Holy Roman Empire. After this state was ended in 16th century, Tirschenreuth first became part of the Electorate of the Palatinate, then part of Bavaria. It became capital of the district of the same name. In 1972, when the segmenting of bavarian districts was reformed, the district of Tirschenreuth was expanded with the former district of Kemnath.
Economy.
One well-known company that resides in Tirschenreuth is Hamm AG, a manufacturer for road rollers.
Tirschenreuth was famous for fine quality porcelain and vintage pieces are highly sought after by collectors. The Famous Porcelain Factory was shut down many years ago.
International relations.
Tirschenreuth is twinned with:

Fresh frozen plasma

The phrase fresh frozen plasma (FFP) refers to the liquid portion of human blood that has been frozen and preserved after a blood donation and will be used for blood transfusion. The capitalized phrase Fresh Frozen Plasma in the United States can refer to the fluid portion of one unit of human blood that has been centrifuged, separated, and frozen solid at or colder within eight hours of collection. The phrase "FFP" is often used to mean any transfused plasma product. The other commonly transfused plasma, PF24, has similar indications as those for FFP with the exception of heat-sensitive proteins in the plasma such as factor V.
The use of plasma and its products has evolved over a period of four decades. The use of FFP has increased tenfold from between the years 2000-2010 and has reached almost 2 million units annually in the United States. This trend may be attributable to multiple factors, possibly including decreased availability of whole blood due to widespread acceptance of the concept of component therapy. FFP contains the labile as well as stable components of the coagulation, fibrinolytic and complement systems; the proteins that maintain oncotic pressure and modulate immunity; and other proteins that have diverse activities. In addition, fats, carbohydrates and minerals are present in concentrations similar to those in circulation. Although well-defined indications exist for the use of FFP in single or multiple coagulation deficiencies, indications for many of its other uses may be empiric.
Indications.
Very few specific indications for the use of FFP exist. These indications generally are limited to the treatment of deficiencies of coagulation proteins for which specific factor concentrates are unavailable or undesirable. In many clinical practices, fresh and frozen plasma contains proteins with two important coagulation factors in it — the V and the VIII. Other documentations indicate FFP has not enough beneficial effect when it is used as a transfusion to stop massive hemorrhage.
In addition, circumstances exist in which FFP has been employed and is believed to be of therapeutic value, but data supporting its efficacy are limited or unavailable (e.g., multiple coagulation protein deficiencies in the uncontrollably bleeding patient). Because such patients are often critically ill and satisfactory alternative therapy may not be at hand, FFP may be appropriate.
Indications for the use of FFP include the following:
Replacement of isolated factor deficiencies.
FFP is efficacious for treatment of deficiencies of factors II, V, VII, IX, X, and XI when specific component therapy is neither available nor appropriate. Requirements for FFP vary with the specific factor being replaced. For example, hemostatic levels of factor IX in a patient with severe deficiency are difficult to achieve with FFP alone, whereas patients with severe factor X deficiency require factor levels of about 10 percent to achieve hemostasis and are easily treated with FFP.
Reversal of warfarin effect.
Patients who are anticoagulated with warfarin are deficient in the functional vitamin K dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. These functional deficiencies can be reversed by the administration of vitamin K. However, for anticoagulated patients who are actively bleeding or who require emergency surgery, FFDP (or single-donor plasma) can be used to achieve immediate hemostasis.
Massive blood transfusion (>1 blood volume within several hours).
Use of FFP in massive blood transfusion, for which there is less credible evidence of efficacy, appears to have increased in frequency in the past decade, possibly due in part to the relative unavailability of whole blood. Pathological hemorrhage in the massively transfused patient is caused more frequently by thrombocytopenia than by depletion of coagulation factors. The empiric use of FFP to reverse hemostatic disorders should be confined to those patients in whom factor deficiencies are presumed to be the sole or principal derangement. There is no evidence that the prophylactic administration of FFP decreases transfusion requirements in multiply transfused patients who do not have documented coagulation defects.
It is however exceedingly common for patients to have documented blood clotting abnormalities (Prolonged APTT, INR) after large blood loss requiring for example 4 units or more of packed red blood cells. FFP is commonly recommended in these settings. In urgent situations it may be unacceptable to wait hours for lab test results before blood products are given. Though unlikely to be done, a clinical trial to prove efficacy and lack of adverse effects of giving empiric FFP compared to placebo would not be unethical, since the true risks and benefits of this currently intuitive practice is unknown.
Use in antithrombin III deficiency.
FFP can be used as a source of antithrombin III in patients who are deficient of this inhibitor and are undergoing surgery or who require heparin for treatment of thrombosis.
Treatment of immunodeficiencies.
FFP is useful in infants with secondary immunodeficiency associated with severe protein-losing enteropathy and in whom total parenteral nutrition is ineffectual. FFP also can be used as a source of immunoglobulin for children and adults with humoral immunodeficiency. However, the development of a purified immune globulin for intravenous use largely has replaced Fresh frozen plasma
Treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
FFP may be beneficial for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Risks.
The risks of FFP include disease transmission, anaphylactoid reactions, alloimmunization, and excessive intravascular volume, as well as transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) and an increase in infections (including surgical wound infections). The potential viral infectivity of FFP probably is similar to that of whole blood and red blood cells. The rate of posttransfusion hepatitis depends on many factors, including donor selection. In rare instances, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted by blood transfusions and possibly by FFP. Allergic or anaphylactoid reactions can occur in response to FFP administration and may vary from hives to fatal noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
FFP should be blood type-matched to ensure compatibility, as agglutination reactions are possible, though rare. The potential for alloimmunization is present, as demonstrated by the infrequent formation of anti-Rh antibodies. For this reason, plasma containing anti-D antibodies (from an RhD-negative donor) is preferably not given to an RhD-positive recipient, and RhD-positive plasma is avoided in RhD-negative women of child-bearing age. As with any intravenously administered fluid, excessive amounts of FFP may result in hypervolemia and cardiac failure.
Alternatives.
Evidence indicates that other plasma components (e.g., single-donor plasma) that do not meet the criteria of FFP may have adequate levels of coagulation factors and are suitable for patients in whom FFP is indicated. Single-donor plasma is efficacious in the treatment of mild deficiencies of stable clotting factors. It also is of value in treatment of multiple deficiencies as in reversal of warfarin effects or in liver disease.
Safe and effective alternative treatment often exists so that FFP is no longer the therapy of choice in many conditions. Cryoprecipitate should be used when fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor is needed. For treatment of hemophilia A, cryoprecipitate or factor VIII concentrates, heated or unheated, are available. For treatment of severe hemophilia B, factor IX complex is preferable. Both of these concentrates are prepared from pooled plasma, and the risk of virus transmission is negligible as there hasn't been an infection since 1985 when techniques were developed to kill off viruses including HIV. The factor IX concentrate carries the additional hazard of thrombogenicity.
Crystalloid, colloid solutions containing human serum albumin or plasma protein fraction, hydroxyethyl starch, and dextran are preferable to FFP for volume replacement. The practice of administering both packed red cells and FFP to the same patient should be discouraged, as this adds to the cost and doubles the infection rate. When conditions are appropriate, whole blood should be given.
For nutritional support, amino acid solutions and dextrose are available.
The most important alternative to the use of FFP is a comprehensive program of blood conservation. This includes measures such as autologous donation before elective surgery, the infusion of shed blood, and the realization that in many patients normovolemic anemia is not an indication for transfusion.
Effectiveness.
There is little scientific evidence to support the increasing use of FFP in clinical medicine purely for volume expansion. While FFP is a reliable solution for intravascular volume replacement in acute blood loss, alternative therapies are equally satisfactory and considerably safer. There is no documentation that FFP has a beneficial effect when used as part of the transfusion management of patients with massive hemorrhage. FFP contains the major plasma proteins, including the labile coagulation factors (V and VIII), but in clinical practice other blood components or derivatives usually provide greater efficacy.
Nevertheless, in augmenting replacement of whole blood lost in catastrophic haemorrhage, FFP replacement must be considered along with replacement of packed red blood cells.

Peter Kocan

Peter Raymond Kocan (born 4 May 1947), Australian author and poet, is remembered in Australia for his attempt to assassinate federal Opposition Leader Arthur Calwell in 1966.
Life and career.
Kocan was born Peter Raymond Douglas in Newcastle, New South Wales and raised in Melbourne. His father, an engineer, was killed in a car accident three months before his birth. Kocan's mother then moved to Melbourne and remarried, but the marriage failed so Peter, his mother and younger brother moved to Sydney. Kocan left school at fourteen to work in New South Wales as a labourer and station-hand, before returning to Sydney, where he gained work as a factory-hand in a dye factory.
On the evening of 21 June 1966, while campaigning for the 1966 federal election, Arthur Calwell addressed an anti-conscription rally at Mosman Town Hall in Sydney. After Calwell left the meeting, just as his car was about to drive off, Kocan approached the passenger side of the vehicle, aimed a sawed-off rifle at Calwell's head and fired at point-blank range. The closed window deflected the bullet, which lodged harmlessly in Calwell's coat lapel. Calwell sustained only minor facial injuries from broken glass. Calwell later visited Kocan in the mental hospital where he was confined for ten years, and forgave him for the incident.
Kocan was tried and found guilty of attempted murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and was detained first at Long Bay Correctional Centre in Sydney. In late December 1966, Kocan was transferred from jail to Ward 6 for the Criminally Insane in Morisset Mental Hospital, at Morisset, south of the city of Newcastle.
During his years in prison and hospital, Kocan immersed himself in history, literature and poetry after a chance remark by another inmate led him to discover the writing of Rupert Brooke. Between 1967 and 1969, the poet Michael Dransfield corresponded and exchanged poems with Kocan. These letters, which comprise drafts of poems by Dransfield, quotes of poems by other poets, and recommendations for books Kocan should read are now held in the collection of the Academy Library of the University of New South Wales.
Kocan began to write poetry in 1967. Two selected works of poetry, "Ceremonies for the lost" (1974) and "The other side of the fence" (1975) were published while he was at Morisset. He was released on license from Morisset in August 1976, and began to write about his experiences. Two autobiographical novellas, "The Treatment" and "The Cure", told of his life in the asylum. "The Cure" won the 1983 NSW Premier's Literary Award for Fiction. His other works include the poetry volumes "Standing with Friends," "Fighting in the Shade", the joint collection "Primary Loyalties," and the science-fiction novel "Flies of a Summer."
Kocan lived for many years on the Central Coast of New South Wales, teaching, acting, and writing drama, poetry, and fiction. He gained public recognition for his work,receiving regular support from the Literary Arts Board of the Australia Council, and has won various literary prizes. He graduated from the University of Newcastle in 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours), and obtained a Masters degree. He moved to Brisbane in 2003. His most recent novel, "Fresh Fields", is a fictionalised account of his youth.

Omicron Aquarii

Omicron Aquarii (ο Aqr, ο Aquarii) is the Bayer designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Aquarius. It has the traditional star name Kae Uh, from the Chinese 蓋屋 (Mandarin "gàiwū)" "the roof". Visible to the naked eye, it has an apparent visual magnitude of +4.71. Parallax measurements put it at a distance of roughly from Earth.
In Chinese, (), meaning "Roofing", refers to an asterism consisting of ο Aquarii and 32 Aquarii. Consequently, ο Aquarii itself is known as (, .)
The spectrum of Omicron Aquarii fits a stellar classification of B7 IVe; the luminosity class of IV suggests that this is a subgiant star that is exhausting the supply of hydrogen at its core and is in the process of evolving into a giant star. The 'e' suffix on the class indicates that the spectrum shows emission lines of hydrogen, thus categorizing this as a Be star. Omicron Aquarii is rotating rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 205 km/s. The rotation rate along the equator may be as high as 77% of the critical rotation velocity, with the axis of rotation being inclined by around . The emission lines are being generated by a decreted circumstellar disk of hot hydrogen gas.
It is classified as a Gamma Cassiopeiae type variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude +4.68 to +4.89.

First patented May 29, 1894 by Fred Menzenhauer, the guitar zither came into use in the late 19th century and was widely mass-produced in the United States and in Germany by Menzenhauer and later by Oscar Schmidt Inc.
A form of psaltery and member of the family of chordophones, the guitar zither is closely related to the Autoharp. It differs from the concert zither in not having a fretboard and from the Autoharp in not having a mechanical process for blocking chords.
The name guitar zither is apparently derived from its sound, as the concert zither is more closely related to the guitar, in performance method, and in physical form, than is the guitar zither. A closely related instrument, the mandolin zither has doubled strings in unison courses producing a more mandolin-like sound.

Hamm AG is a German worldwide manufacturer and marketer of road rollers based in Tirschenreuth, Germany. It is a subsidiary of Wirtgen Group.
Brothers Anton and Franz Hamm, who were gunsmiths, founded the company in 1878 to build agricultural equipment. The company built their first diesel-powered road roller in 1911, from a design by a second-generation Hamm, Hans Hamm. This was at a time when most rollers where steam powered. In 1928 the company abandoned all other product lines to concentrate on road rollers. Hamm produces the first all-wheel drive-all-wheel steering double-drum, or tandem, roller in 1932, and retains patent protection rights until 1970. The company introduced an all-wheel steering and all-wheel drive rubber-wheeled roller in 1963, and then rolled out its oscillating vibratory roller in 1989.
In 1999 the Wirtgen Group GmbH announced that it would purchase Hamm AG, and the transaction was completed in March 2000.

Muhammad Bassiri

Muhammad Sidi Brahim Sidi Embarek Basir (; b. 1942 or October 1944 - disappeared on June 18, 1970) was a Sahrawi nationalist leader, disappeared and presumedly executed by the Spanish Legion in June 1970.
Biography.
Muhammad Bassiri was born in a Sahrawi family in Tan-Tan (nowadays Southern Morocco, then part of the Cap Juby Spanish protectorate).
In 1957 he left Tan-Tan for the newly independent Morocco to attend school in Marrakesh, and proceeded to study the Quran & Arabic in Cairo, Egypt and Journalism in Damascus, Syria, where he get in touch with the Panarabism ideology. On returning to Morocco in 1966, he founded "Al-Shihab" (The Torch), a Sahrawi nationalist newspaper. He also worked as a journalist in Casablanca
In March 1968 he was allowed to enter to Spanish Sahara (he had tried to enter on December 1967, but he was detained and expelled), because of the closing of the newspaper by Moroccan authorities in late 1967, and settled in the city of Smara as a Quranic teacher. It was there he started to organize the anti-colonial movement known as the "movement of liberation" (In Arabic: Harakat Tahrir) calling for end of Spanish occupation of the Sahara. Bassiri stressed non-violence (influenced by the peaceful struggle of Gandhi in the colonized India) and wanted to bring about change through democratic action, although the ruthless colonial rule imposed by Francisco Franco's Fascist Spain forced the Harakat Tahrir to remain clandestine. Bassiri didn't want a precipitated independence, but to negotiate with the Spanish authorities
Disappearance.
On early June 17, 1970 the organization appeared openly in a peaceful demonstration against the Spanish colonial rule, asking for autonomy (as a first step to independence) and self-determination in the Zemla neighborhood of El-Aaiun, in parallel to an official Francoist demonstration. The Spanish governor-general of the colony, General José María Pérez de Lema y Tejero, went to Zemla to discuss with the organizers of the demonstration, but did not reach an agreement to make them leave the place and join the official demonstration. Tensions escalated between the growing mass of Sahrawi protesters and the Spanish reservist soldiers, who were stoned-throwed after detaining 3 speakers of the protest, answered opening fire on the mass at 17:30 PM. Disturbance continued until 19:00 PM, when troops of the Tercio "Juan de Austria" of the Spanish Legion brutally put down what remained of the protesters. The events were seen by the Spanish authorities as a defiance to the official demonstration organized by the General governor, made to show the world the supposed Sahrawi support to the Spanish regime and refusal to the UN involvement. These events have been dubbed the Zemla Intifada by Sahrawis.
Bassiri, who had abandoned Zemla before violence erupted, was informed of the events. He was offered to escape to Mauritania by car, but he refused it. According to Salem Lebser, he replied: "Nobody could say I'm an adventurer who has led people to death and then disappeared..I already fled once Morocco, where I felt like a stranger. But I would not fled from my own land". Bassiri was tracked down that night, detained around 03:00 AM of June 18, and jailed at El Aaiun Territorial Police headquarters. On June 19, and after being allegedly tortured, he testified before the Spanish military authorities. A photograph of him registering before the "Habs Shargui" prison authorities is the last known trace of him. Later, he was allegedly moved to "Sidi Buya", the Spanish Legion headquarters in El Aaiun. According to testimonies given by three different persons to then apostolic prefect to Spanish Sahara Félix Erviti Barcelona, Bassiri was executed by a Spanish Legion patrol in the dunes surrounding El Aaiun on the night of 29 July 1970, although Spanish authorities of the time claimed that he had been expelled from the territory to Morocco on that date, moreover they also claimed later that Bassiri had entered Spanish Sahara illegally from Algeria in September 1970. Spanish colonial authorities even claimed in 1971 that Bassiri had died on the Skhirat coup d'etat against Hassan II.
Present-day Sahrawi nationalists such as the Polisario Front honor him as the father of the modern Sahrawi independence struggle, as well as the first of the Sahrawi "disappeared" and a national martyr for the Liberty.

Singapore Improvement Trust

History.
The Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) was a government organisation set up in 1927 by the British colonial government in Singapore in response to the housing needs of the population of Singapore. At that time, many people resided in overcrowded shophouses and squatter settlements, resulting in widespread disease and lack of hygiene and sanitation. Often, over 200 people would live in one shophouse. This also generated massive civil unrest and crime. 
The SIT was formed with the recruitment of Captain Edwin Percy Richards as deputy chairman. The SIT was composed of professional architects and contractors to resolve this large social problem, with the goal of building affordable public housing for the common population of Singapore. 
Projects.
One of its earliest projects was the Tiong Bahru housing estate, which is regarded as the first public housing estate of Singapore. However, SIT managed to build only 23,000 housing units in 32 years, unable to find an effective solution to the lack of housing as the population grew faster than it built housing units.
Singapore's first satellite new town, Queenstown, was initiated by SIT in the 1950s but has been developed mostly by HDB.

National Law University, Jodhpur

National Law University, Jodhpur is a National law university in India. The University offers both under-graduate and post-graduate courses in various streams of law. 
The degrees offered at the under-graduate level are;
All of these are ten semester courses, and are open to students only on a fully residential basis. Since 2008, the admission to these courses is through the nation-wide Common Law Admission Test, the first of which took place on 11 May 2008. 
At the post-graduate level the degrees offered are:
The admission to these courses is though the National Entrance Tests organised by the University each year.
History.
The National Law University, Jodhpur was set up in November 1999 (by the passing of the National Law University Act,1999 by the State Legislature of Rajasthan) under the leadership of Dr. N.L. Mitra. Since then the University has seen three more Vice-Chancellors. The first batch (both under-graduate and post-graduate) of the University was admitted in the year 2001. The first under-graduate batch passed out in 2006 with their graduation ceremony (First Convocation) organised in January 2007 and attended by the then Vice-President of India Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and the then Governor of Rajasthan and formerly the President of India H.E. Mrs. Pratibha Patil. 
The second under-graduate batch passed out in 2007 and the Convocation ceremony for them was organised on 29 March 2008 and was attended by the then Home Minister, Government of India, Mr. Shivraj Patil.
Philosophy.
Established in 2001, National Law University claims to be the first institution of its kind in the country where study of law is coupled with other disciplines such as Science, Management Science and Policy Sciences. It introduced for the first time the degree of B.B.A., LL.B. (Hons) (i.e. Management and Law) in the country, requiring the students of the course to undertake specialised courses in Management Studies (such as Audit, Accounting, Principles of Management, Organizational Behaviour, Marketing, Strategy, etc.) and assimilate the learning therein especially with the fast evolving corporate and financial laws. 
As the University itself puts it, National Law University only answers the intention to do the same from the entire country following the traditions of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in technology education, Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) in the management education and All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) in medical education. Terming its establishment as a Third Generation Experiment, the University calls forth and furthers the need behind viewing and handling legal education today in a multidisciplinary scenario.

On the external side, since its establishment, the University has been hosting the M.M. Singhvi Bar Council of India Trust Moot Court Competition, organised to commemorate the memory of the late M.M. Singhvi, a lawyer in India. The Competition is organised under the aegis of the M.M. Singhvi Memorial Trust and the Bar Council of India.

The Second NLU AntiTrust Law Moot Court Competition was held from the 17 to 20 February 2011.
On the internal front, moot courts are well integrated in the curriculum of the University. In all law subjects (beginning right from the first semester of the under-graduate program), 15–20 percent of the marks are earmarked for moot courts and are assessed by the panel of two or three judges (teaching faculty or retired judges) where the students are required to address the court on the problem related to the subject-matter being taught in the paper and assessed upon their performance. Based on the cumulative performance in these internal moot courts and other criterion, the Moot Court Committee organises an intra-University moot court competition once in each semester and depending upon the rankings of these intra-University moot court competitions, the students are sent to represent the University in various National and International Moot Court Competitions.
The students have performed well in various national and international moot court competitions. The University was victorious at the Susan J. Ferrell Inter-cultural Human Rights Moot Court Competition conducted by the St. Thomas University, Florida, in January 2007.

Pi Aquarii

Pi Aquarii (π Aqr, π Aquarii) is the Bayer designation for a binary star in the equatorial constellation of Aquarius. It shares the traditional name Seat with Delta Aquarii, where it has long been misspelled "Skat." It may be from the Arabic word "ši'at" "a wish". This system has an apparent visual magnitude of a mean apparent magnitude of +4.57. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of roughly from Earth.
This is a binary star system with an orbital period of 84.1 ± 0.004. The primary component is a B-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of B1 Ve. This is a large star with nearly eleven times the mass and over six times the radius of the Sun. Pi Aquarii shines about 7,300 times as brightly as the Sun. This energy is being radiated from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 27,094, giving it the blue-hued glow of a B-type star. It is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 215 km/s.
Pi Aquarii is notable for having undergone a transition from a Be star (showing hydrogen emission lines) into an ordinary B-type star. It is classified as a Gamma Cassiopeiae type variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude +4.45 to +4.71; a range of 0.28. The dominant variability period, , is nearly the same as the orbital period.
In culture.
In Chinese, (), meaning "Tomb", refers to an asterism consisting of π Aquarii, γ Aquarii, ζ Aquarii, η Aquarii. Consequently, π Aquarii itself is known as (, .)
In the catalogue of stars in the "Calendarium" of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Wasat al Achbiya (وسط الأخبية - "wasath al ahbiyah"), which was translated into Latin as Media Tabernaculorum, meaning "the middle of luck of the homes (tents)". This star, along with γ Aqr (Sadachbia), ζ Aqr (Sadaltager / Achr al Achbiya) and η Aqr (Hydria), were al Aḣbiyah (الأخبية), the Tent.

Eurobasket 1937.
The Poles took fourth place with an overall record of 2–3 at the second European basketball championship, the Eurobasket 1937 held by the International Basketball Federation's FIBA Europe continental federation. They took first place in their four-team preliminary group on a three-way tie-breaker after France and Latvia both matched the Polish team's 2–1 record. They then lost to eventual champions Lithuania in the semifinals and were defeated a second time by France in the bronze medal game.
Eurobasket 1939.
Poland won the bronze medal in their second Eurobasket competition. The competition format was a single round-robin without playoffs; Latvia and Lithuania both defeated Poland whereas the other five teams in the competition fell to the Poles. With Lithuania undefeated and Poland and Latvia tied at 5–2, the loss to Latvia was decisive in pushing Poland to third place.
Eurobasket 1946.
Due to World War II, the next European championship was Eurobasket 1946. The Poles started well, with a victory over Luxembourg. They lost their next two preliminary games to Italy and Hungary to finish in third place of the four-team group. This put them in the 7th–10th place classification semifinal, where they lost again, this time to Belgium. In the 9th/10th playoff, Poland defeated England.
Eurobasket 1947.
The European championships returned to the odd-year schedule with Eurobasket 1947. Poland placed second in their preliminary group, losing only to eventual silver medallist Czechoslovakia en route to a 2–1 record. They then went 1–2 in their semifinal group, falling to the gold medal Soviet Union team and bronze medal Egypt. This put Poland in a 5th/6th place playoff against France, who had been 1–2 in the opposite semifinal group. France won, 62–29.
Eurobasket 1955.
After an 8-year hiatus, Poland returned with Eurobasket 1955 in Budapest. They quickly showed that they could still play with the European field, winning all four of their preliminary round games to advance to the final round. Despite their mediocre 3–4 record in that round, the Poles had demonstrated that they could be effective against the best of the European pool with a 72–68 win over eventual silver medallist Czechoslovakia. They finished 5th overall of the 18 teams in the tournament.
Eurobasket 1957.
Two years later in Sofia, Poland competed at Eurobasket 1957. Despite being seeded into the same preliminary pool as the Soviet Union, the Poles went 2–1 in the round-robin and advanced to the final round. They lost their first six of seven games in that round, getting their first win in the last game of the round, against France to take 7th place overall.
Eurobasket 2007.
After a 10-year break, Poland returned with Eurobasket. It was quite sn unexpected achievement. The Poles advanced from eliminations defeated their group rivals : Ukraine, Bulgaria and Sweden. Because of injury, many key players including Michał Ignerski and Maciej Lampe did not compete. The Poles lost all 3 games, but even in defeat they remained competitive losing by 8 to a well-regarded French team and by 9 to the Italian squad.

Collingham, Nottinghamshire

Collingham is a village and civil parish in Nottinghamshire, England.
Collingham is located on the banks of the River Trent on the A1133 main road, just off the A46. It is approximately from Newark-on-Trent, from the city of Lincoln, and from the city of Nottingham.
History.
Collingham is close to the old Roman Fort at Brough and there have been several local finds of Roman coins, jewellery and villa remains. It lies close to the Fosse Way on its way to Lincoln. The village name suggests a fairly early Saxon foundation, preceding the occupation of eastern England by the Danes and it is naturally mentioned in the Domesday Book. It is thought that the Great North Road crossed the Trent here before Newark was founded; prior to the river's change of channel westwards it ran close to the village and was the cause of much flooding. Many of the other villages close by have names which suggest that they were later daughter settlements. It possessed two churches in North and South Collingham from before the Norman Conquest. The parishes extended from the river floodplain onto the uncultivated moorland on the higher ground between Trent and Witham, allowing for good grazing and meadowland throughout the year.
In medieval and early modern times Collingham operated an openfield system and enclosure did not take place until the turn of the 18th/19th centuries, changing much local farming from a small holding of strips and the right to extensive grazing, to individual small cottage holdings or a precarious existence as a landless agricultural labourer. The wide square fields and relatively few isolated farms are the result. One field was set aside in the enclosure award of 1790 for lease every year with the revenues being put to the use of the poor of the parish. Around the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century there was an influx of agricultural labour, displaced from the enclosures of the upland Lincolnshire villages in places like Boothby Graffoe, Coleby and Harmston, taking the place of former Collingham people who had moved to towns such as Lincoln, Newark and Nottingham in search of better employment.
During the siege of Newark in the English Civil War, the countryside was subject to deprivation from the opposing armies wanting food and fresh horses and the village suffered. In 1664, a mercer of Collingham, one Thomas Ridge, issued his own copper halfpenny tokens, in response to currency shortage after the Civil war.
In the nineteenth century Collingham was fairly self-sufficient with its own watchmaker, shoemakers, blacksmiths, dressmakers, schools, grocers and carriers. There were many local societies and the Nonconformist Churches had their own congregations. At one point there was considerable enmity between the Vicar of North Collingham and the Rector of South Collingham with many disputes about the schools in the village. There are a large number of listed buildings in the village [http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/england/nottinghamshire/collingham], from the c16 through to the c19, and the village is highly valued as a place to live and commute from.
More information is available on the village's website Collingham Website
Facilities.
Local amenities include the Co-op and One-Stop convenience stores, butchers, general store, newsagent, and post office. There is a medical centre/dentist/pharmacy complex which serves much of the surrounding area, plus a library in the same building. Now collectively known as Collingham Village Centre, negotiations are currently under way between Collingham Parish Council, Lincolnshire Co-operative, Collingham Football Club, and other interested parties, to build a new, much larger, Co-op supermarket, and a greatly enlarged car park. This will add another two to four retail outlets in the Village Centre, and is supported by the majority of the villagers who voted in a Parish Council survey.
There are some sporting facilities in Collingham, notably Collingham Football Club and Collingham Cricket Club. There are also facilities for tennis, bowling and croquet while the nearby River Trent seems very popular with anglers.
Collingham is fairly easy to get to by road or railway, being very close to the A46 and 5.5 miles from the A1/A46 junction at Newark-on-Trent. Collingham is served by the Nottingham-Lincoln railway line used by East Midlands Trains and you can reach most parts of the Midlands. There is an East Coast station at Newark Northgate from which London can be reached as well as all locations on the East Coast mainline. A bus service to Newark operates on an irregular basis, with two daily buses running to Lincoln on a daily basis.
Bypass.
One ongoing issue affecting the village regards a bypass. The issue is not new, and has surfaced a number of times over the past sixty years or so, the last time being rejected in favour of another project in the county, a new bus station in Mansfield. The proposed bypass is not seen as a priority and in addition would damage the countryside and natural environment along the east side of the village.Many villagers pose the argument that the damage to the environment would be more than offset by the reduction in damage to the built environment along the High Street, and the cessation of the use of Low Street as a 'rat run' to avoid the traffic lights at the Station Road junction. Pressure groups within the village continue to campaign for the bypass to be built, regardless of how remote the possibility.
Notable people.
The composer John Blow was born in the village and two villagers, John and William Bacon were in the Charge of the Light Brigade (under the assumed name of Baker). William was killed and John returned but later left the Army and both are buried in North Collingham churchyard.
Drummer William Bowerman, formerly of 'I Was A Cub Scout' is from Collingham. He is now playing with experimental band 'Brontide'.

Penwortham

Penwortham () is a town and civil parish in the South Ribble borough of Lancashire, England. It is situated on the south bank of the River Ribble facing the city of Preston. The town is at the most westerly crossing point of the river, with major road and rail links crossing here.
History.
The distinctive town name is derived from pen (meaning a hill), weid (meaning ford) and ham (meaning settlement) with earlier names of Peneverdant and Pendrecham in 1200; Penwrtham in 1204; Penuertham in 1212; Penwortham 1260 and Penewrthamn in 1292.
The town's history can be traced to pre-historic times with archaeological evidence showing that the ford at Middleforth was used to cross the Ribble. Penwortham was listed in the Domesday Book as "Penverdent". At the Norman conquest in 1066 the Barony was held by King Edward. In the 12th century Penwortham was the head of a barony held by Warine Bussel which included a large part of Leyland Hundred and manors in West Derby and Amounderness. Penwortham Castle, a motte-and-bailey castle was built during the post-Norman conquest period overlooking the Ribble and its ford by Roger of Poitou and served to guard the estuary and a ford crossing it. After Roger built Lancaster Castle, Penwortham declined in importance. Some evidence of this castle is still evident in St Mary's Churchyard but only the mound remains. In later centuries a manor house was built, but no evidence remains.
The barony was acquired by Roger de Lacy in 1205, and descended as part of the Honor of Clitheroe to the Earls and Dukes of Lancaster and the Crown. In the 16th century there were disputes about suit and service due to the court of Penwortham from the members of the fee. Charles I sold the royal manor to Edward Ditchfield and others in 1628 and it later passed to the Faringtons of Worden in Leyland. Courts were held until the late 19th century. Court rolls and books are kept at Worden Hall. Penwortham Priory was built in the west of the town.
Higher Penwortham has an old legend linked to it. The Fairy Funeral seen on the road through Penwortham Wood, was thought to forecast death.
Penwortham Hall, formerly called "The Lodge", was built in 1801 by John Horrocks, founder of the Preston cotton-manufacturing industry. It was sold by his son Peter to William Marshall, whose son Frederick died in 1889. It was left by Frederick to his sister, the wife of Rev. T. Ross Finch. The property, which is a Grade II listed building, is today used as a series of private dwellings.
The parish was part of Preston Rural District throughout its existence from 1894 to 1974. In 1974 the parish became part of the Borough of South Ribble.
Demography.
Penwortham is one of the largest civil parishes by population in Lancashire, with a population of 23,436 recorded in the 2001 census. The town's development closely resembles that of Preston.
Geography.
The Middleforth, Lower Penwortham, area was developed during the Victorian period which is evidenced by the large number of terrace housing along Leyland Road and the surrounding streets. Higher Penwortham is characterised by its 1920s and onwards, post-war semi-detached housing.
In recent times there have been several new housing developments, especially around the Broad Oak Farm, Bee Lane, Kingsfold Drive, Stricklands Lane and Factory Lane areas of the town.
Landmarks.
Penwortham Priory was built for the Rawsthorne family and redesigned by the Cumbrian architect George Webster. The priory was demolished due to the rapid expansion of the area and the need for new housing. Penwortham Church Lodge was originally situated on Penwortham Hill towards Preston, but as a consequence of widening the A59 road the lodge was taken down and removed to a residential road in Hutton. Penwortham Water Tower was built in the late 19th century and has been converted to a dwelling. It is part of a development of semi-detached cottages built for employees of the local squire, Lawrence Rawstorne.
Education.
As well as a number of primary schools, the three high schools in Penwortham are Penwortham Girls' High, All Hallows Catholic High School and Penwortham Priory Academy. All are situated in proximity to Liverpool Road, in the centre of the town.
Public services and amenities.
Penwortham has two supermarkets, a Sainsbury's which was converted from a Kwik Save in 2007, and a Booth's which opened in the mid-1990s. There are three fish and chip shops.
Penwortham Leisure Centre, is part of Penwortham Priory Academy, whose swimming pool is used by the general public.
One of Lancashire's oldest charities, Galloway's Society for the Blind, established in 1867, has had its headquarters in Penwortham since 1950. The charity provides services to 6,500 blind and visually impaired people across Lancashire and beyond.
Transport.
The area has now nearly merged with Preston with excellent transport links across the river. Higher Penwortham is situated on the A59 road which leads into Preston via the "Preston Flyover", which is the main crossing over the river.Penwortham Cop Lane railway station was on the West Lancashire Railway between Preston and Southport, until the line closed in 1964. The cutting which carried the railway under Cop Lane has been widened and now carries the A582 Penwortham bypass.
Bus routes serving Penwortham are provided by John Fishwick & Sons, Preston Bus and Stagecoach. Frequent bus services are Fishwick's Preston–Leyland route and the Preston–Penwortham circular operated by Stagecoach.
Community Events.
Throughout the year, many events are ran in Penwortham to bring together the community and celebrate different occasions. The longest running event, Penwortham Gala, is held annually on Hurst Grange Park, starting with a procession of floats that are filled with children from local primary schools and community organisations. This is followed by entertainment, stalls and a funfair throughout the day and into the evening. 
Penwortham Live had its second event after beginning in April 2013, as a festival of music, art, drama and poetry. Live entertainment was available over the weekend throughout many local businesses, predominantly on the main high street, Liverpool Road. 
Penwortham Christmas market is an annual festive market located on Liverpool Road. A one day event in December, offering craft stalls, gifts, food and drink and entertainment.

Kohnstamm's phenomenon

First described by German neurologist Oskar Kohnstamm (1871–1917) in 1915, Kohnstamm's phenomenon is a sustained involuntary contraction of a muscle after a prolonged voluntary contraction. The simplest demonstration, sometimes called "the floating arms experiment", is to have a subject press the arms against a door frame or wall for about thirty seconds, and then step away. The arm will involuntarily rise.
Russian scientists Victor Gurfinkel, Mikhail Lebedev and Yuri Levick used Kohnstamm's phenomenon to activate tonogenic structures in humans and thereby demonstrate postural automatisms, such as neck reflexes.

Michael Dransfield

Michael Dransfield (12 September 1948 – 20 April 1973) was an Australian poet active in the 1960s and early 1970s who wrote close to 1,000 poems. He has been described as "one of the most widely read poets of his generation." 
Early life.
Dransfield was born in Sydney, and educated at Sydney Grammar School. He briefly studied English literature and language at the University of New South Wales and Sydney University before dropping out. He worked for some months as a clerk at the Australian Taxation Office before drifting into the counter-culture. From then on he worked intermittently, living mainly in Paddington, Balmain, and Darlinghurst in Sydney, and in the north coast town of Casino, and he travelled frequently between Tasmania and Queensland, visiting his large group of friends and fellow poets.
Poetry.
Dransfield wrote his first poem at the age of eight and began to write regularly at fourteen. He was a prolific poet, writing lyrical poems, which as his career progressed came to focus more and more on drug experiences. His poetry was first published in the mid-1960s.
Dransfield's poems were published in "Meanjin", "Southerly", "Poetry Australia" and "Poetry" magazine. His first published collection was "Streets of the Long Voyage". He published two more books, including "Drug poems" (Sun Books, 1972).
Between 1967 and 1969, Dransfield corresponded and exchanged poems with Peter Kocan, who had been imprisoned for attempting to assassinate federal opposition leader Arthur Calwell, and who was then a patient at the Morisset Mental Hospital in Morisset, New South Wales. The letters comprise drafts of poems by Dransfield, quotes of poems by other poets, and recommendations for books Kocan should read.
Themes.
Dransfield's poems address "people marginalized by society" "the relationship of the creative self to the outside world" "personal identity, the family, the relationship between human beings and the natural world, poetry itself, and states of mind"
Death.
In his early twenties Dransfield was plagued by ill health. He died at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Sydney, on 20 April 1973, aged 24, leaving behind close to a thousand poems. Sources report conflicting causes of death, including that he died of a heroin overdose, infection related to drug use and a report that the coroner's finding on the cause of death was "acute broncho-pneumonia and brain damage".
Legacy.
Rodney Hall, who as poetry editor of "The Australian" newspaper had been among the first to publish Dransfield's poetry, edited and posthumously published several collections of Dransfield's poetry during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including "Collected Poems" (UQP, 1987). In 2011 a poet character called "Michael" (evidently based on Dransfield) was featured in the second part of the ABC telemovie "".

<doc id="2859226" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2859226" title="Hindmarsh Stadium">
Hindmarsh Stadium

Hindmarsh Stadium (currently known as Coopers Stadium due to sponsorship from the Adelaide based Coopers Brewery) is a multi-purpose stadium located in Adelaide, South Australia. It is the home of the Australian A-League team, Adelaide United. 
The stadium now has a capacity of 17,000, of which 15,500 is seated. Home team, Adelaide United regularly fill this capacity, and averaged crowds of over 12,000 to its matches during the 2006/2007 Season and 2007/2008 Season. United used the stadium for its home matches in the 2008 AFC Asian Champions League, the 2010 AFC Asian Champions League, and the 2012 AFC Asian Champions League.
History.
Built in 1960, the stadium stands on the site that was once Hindmarsh Oval which housed the West Torrens Football Club of the SANFL from 1905 until 1921, when the team moved to nearby Thebarton Oval which would remain its home until 1989.
The Soccer Association of South Australia owned land on a former brick pit on Torrens Road at Brompton named Rowley Park which was located only 5 km from the city, and the original plan was for the land to be the home of Soccer in SA. However, the Soccer Association had received negative press regarding its failure to grow grass on the site. Rowley Park also had a tendency to flood during winter as the bottom of "The Brick Pit" was below the level of the water table which made playing soccer virtually impossible. The land was eventually leased to a group of speedway drivers and would become the famous Rowley Park Speedway which ran from December 1949 until it closed in April 1979. The land was eventually sold and is now the Kym Bonython housing estate, named for the speedway's long time promoter Kym Bonython.
When it became obvious to the Soccer Association that Rowley Park would be unsuitable as a soccer venue they obtained a lease on Hindmarsh Oval from the Hindmarsh Council. The old Hindmarsh Oval was developed over the years into a rectangular stadium capable of holding 15,000 with a single tier grandstand built in 1960 that held approximately 2,000 while 6 light towers for night games (plus another 8 smaller light towers on the grandstand roof) were installed during the mid-1970's. Other than the grandstand, the ground was all terracing surrounding the playing surface. This changed in 1996 when seats were installed on the eastern side of the ground.
Along with the Olympic Sports Field, Hindmarsh became one of two Adelaide venues in the then new but now-defunct National Soccer League in 1977. Hindmarsh was the home ground of the Adelaide City Zebras (who also played games at the Sports Field), and later the home ground for West Adelaide Hellas. Hindmarsh would eventually became the sole Adelaide NSL venue during the late 1980's.
In 1986 Hindmarsh stadium hosted the first leg of the NSL Grand Final between Adelaide City and Sydney Olympic. Unfortunately for Adelaide fans Olympic won 1-0. Adelaide would go on to win the 2nd leg in Sydney 3-1 and become NSL Champions. Hindmarsh again hosted the NSL Grand Final (this time a single game) in 1994-95 when Adelaide City faced the Mark Viduka led Melbourne Knights. In front of a packed house of over 16,000 the Knights defeated the Zebras 2-0.
As soccer was generally played to smaller crowds during the 1970's and 80's, Hindmarsh became a regular host of the Socceroos in some of their international matches, with Adelaide based players such as Robert Zabica, Alex Tobin, and the Vidmar brothers Aurelio and Tony all playing prominent roles.
Hindmarsh Stadium not only hosted soccer matches but also hosted Rugby Union and Rugby League. In 1992 the New Zealand All Blacks played an exhibition game against a South Australian 'Select' team which included former Wallabies Lock and current day author/media personality Peter FitzSimons. The All Blacks, including goal kicking Stand-off Grant Fox who would retire the following year as the All Blacks highest ever point scorer, ran out easy winners while FitzSimons, playing up to the crowd by humorously claiming innocence, was sent off mid-way through the second half after numerous infringements. At the time this made FitzSimons the only Wallaby (although his international career had finished by the time of the match) to ever be sent off in a match against the All Blacks.
In 1996 as part of the rebuilding of the venue before the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, the original single tier grandstand with its wooden bench seats was demolished and replaced by the current two tier structure. The terracing on the opposite wing was also removed and replaced by seating. When the ground was rebuilt before the Olympics only the new grandstand would remain in place.
In 1998 the short lived National Rugby League team the Adelaide Rams used Hindmarsh for their last 4 home games of the 1998 NRL season. The Rams début at the venue was a success when they thumped the Balmain Tigers 52-0 in front of 7,351 fans. The Rams would end up 2-2 at Hindmarsh after defeating the Auckland Warriors, but losing to Manly-Warringah and North Sydney. The Rams were to continue using Hindmarsh as their home ground in the 1999 NRL season giving them a rectangular venue suited to league rather than an oval as was their previous home, the Adelaide Oval. However the team was wound up by owners News Ltd only weeks before the start of the 1999 season.
Hindmarsh Stadium was one of the venues chosen to host preliminary matches for the men's soccer during the 2000 Olympics held in Sydney. This saw the stadium receive almost a complete rebuild which brought it to its present status. The field was lengthened from 110 to 120 metres to be able to also accommodate both rugby league and rugby union which used longer field dimensions (though the minimum field length of a union field including in-goal areas is actually 120 metres so shorter than desirable in-goals are required), the 6 old light towers were replaced with 4 television standard ones (one in each corner) and the former terracing was now all seated, uncovered stands with only the grandstand built in the mid-1990's remaining in place. During the Olympics, temporary stands were erected in the corners of the stadium to bring capacity up to 20,000. Hosting matches from Groups A and B, the highest recorded attendance at Hindmarsh was 18,340 when Italy drew 1-1 Nigeria on 19 September 2000.
Other soccer played in the stadium in the past include several international matches, including most of the games played in the 2004 OFC Nations Cup - an event where the Socceroos began their qualifying campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In 2007 the venue hosted the first two rounds of the Olyroos campaign as they qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics. With the rise in the sports popularity in Australia, Hindmarsh is rarely used these days by the Socceroos other than for training purposes or matches against lower ranked countries such as those from the Pacific islands. International matches now generally take place at larger capacity venues such as Sydney's 84,000 seat ANZ Stadium, Brisbane's 52,500 seat Suncorp Stadium, or the largest stadium in the Southern Hemisphere, the 100,024 capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground. Though with the redevelopment of the Adelaide Oval to a world class, 53,500 capacity stadium, there is renewed speculation the Socceroos will return to Adelaide for high profile international matches.
On 15 April 2006 on a Saturday night the stadium hosted its first NRL match since the Rams final home game in 1998 when the Sydney based Penrith Panthers played that year's NRL Grand Finalist the Melbourne Storm. With 7,017 fans in attendance the Storm ran out easy 40-18 winners with emerging rugby league superstar Greg Inglis scoring 3 tries for Melbourne. It was a home match for the Panthers who brought the game to Adelaide due to renovations being completed at their usual home, Penrith Park in western Sydney.
The Stadium's Record attendance outside of the 2000 Olympic Games is 17,000 at the 2008 AFC Champions League Final Second leg between Adelaide United and Gamba Osaka of Japan. Adelaide lost 2-0, but still became runners up. This remains Adelaide United's record attendance at Hindmarsh.
On 3 October 2008 it was announced by the SA Government Minister for Recreation and Sport Michael Wright coach Ricky Stuart, head coach of Sydney based NRL team the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, that the Sharks would play three NRL home games at Hindmarsh over 3 years starting from 2009. The first of those was against the North Queensland Cowboys on 19 April 2009. On a sunny autumn day the Cowboys defeated the Sharks 34-10 in front of 8,547 fans, the record crowd for a rugby league match at Hindmarsh.
Unfortunately for NRL fans in Adelaide it was announced early in the 2010 season that Cronulla had been allowed by the SA Government to pull out of their contract. Cronulla's official reasons were wanting to concentrate on their home fans by not taking home games away from Toyota Stadium. The NRL return to Adelaide in 2010 when the another Sydney based club Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs played a home game at the Adelaide Oval instead of Hindmarsh against the Melbourne Storm. The Bulldogs had planned to make the Adelaide Oval their 'other' home, returning in 2011, again against the Storm, but this was also abandoned after just two years.

Let's Get Together Now

Let's Get Together Now is an official song used as an anthem for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Performed by the supergroup Voice of Korea/Japan (Lena Park and Brown Eyes for South Korea and Sowelu and Chemistry for Japan), it was released in three separate versions: a full Japanese version, a full Korean version (with some English at the end), and a merged version which combines the lyrics of the two versions. The last of the three was included in the official soundtrack album and was performed in the opening ceremonies in Seoul on May 31, 2002.
Composed by Daisuke Kawaguchi and Kim Hyung-Suk and written by Yoshimitsu Sawamoto, Kiyoshi Matsuo, Park, and Kim, the lyrics tell spirit of gathering and coming together as one, as the with the theme of the two countries in co-hosting the said event. Although this is not the official theme song (which is "Boom" by Anastacia), this song proves to be popular.
The single was certified gold by the RIAJ in March 2002.

Google Reader

Google Reader was an RSS/Atom feed aggregator operated by Google. It was created in early 2005 by Google engineer Chris Wetherell and launched on October 7, 2005, through Google Labs. Google Reader grew in popularity to support a number of apps which used it as a platform for serving news and information to people. Google closed Google Reader on July 1, 2013, citing declining use.
History.
In early 2001, software engineer Chris Wetherell began a project he called "JavaCollect" that served as a news portal based on web feeds. After working at Google he began a similar project with a small team that launched an improved product on October 7, 2005, as Google Reader.
In September 2006 Google announced a redesign for Reader that included new features such as unread counts, the ability to "mark all as read", a new folder-based navigation, and an expanded view so people could quickly scan over several items at once. This also marked the addition of a sharing feature, which allowed readers to publish interesting items for other people to see.
In January 2007 Google added video content from YouTube and Google Video to Reader.
In September 2007 product marketing manager Kevin Systrom (later, founder of Instagram) announced that Google Reader had graduated out of Google Labs.
In March 2013 Google announced that Google Reader would be discontinued on July 1, 2013. As of July 2, 2013, visiting the Google Reader site provides an information page about the service's closure.
Interface.
Reader's interface evolved several times from an early version, described by a Google designer who helped work on the revision as a "river" of news, to various experiences optimized for a wide range of devices, from browsers to the Wii video game console.
In late 2008, Google Reader had a significant upgrade to its user experience and design. Led by Google designer Jenna Bilotta, the interface now included a cleaner visual style, collapsible navigation, "Friends" navigation, the ability to hide unread counts, and feed bundles.
Some of the features of Google Reader in 2013 were:
Organization.
Users could subscribe to feeds using either Google Reader's search function, or by entering in the exact URL of the RSS or Atom feed. New posts from those feeds were then shown on the left-hand side of the screen. One could then order that list by date or relevance. Items could also be organized with labels, as well as being able to create "Starred Items" for easy access.
Sharing.
From 2007 to 2011, items in Google Reader could be shared with other Web users. Previously this was done by sending a link through e-mail, directing the user to the shared article; or by creating a basic webpage that includes all shared items from a user's account. In December 2007, Google changed the sharing policy so that items the user marked as shared were automatically visible to their Google Talk contacts. Users criticized this change because there was no way to opt out.
Google removed the sharing functionality built into Reader in October 2011, and replaced it with a Google+ +1 button. Users criticized this change because it effectively dismantled existing social networks that had formed around these features and disabled sharing and publishing functions that served as a communications medium for Iranians seeking news sources that couldn't be blocked by the government.
The Google+ +1 button and count of how many people liked an article were removed in March 2013 shortly after the announcement that Google Reader would be discontinued.
Offline access.
Google Reader was the first application to make use of Google Gears, a browser extension that lets online applications work offline. Users who installed the extension could download up to 2000 items to be read offline. After coming back online, Google Reader updated the feeds. Google Reader stopped supporting this feature in June 2010.
Mobile access.
A mobile interface was released on May 18, 2006. It could be used by devices that support XHTML or WAP 2.0. On May 12, 2008, Google announced a version of Google Reader targeted at iPhone users. On December 2010, Google released a Google Reader app for Android, available from the Android Market.
iGoogle.
On May 4, 2006, Google released a new feature which enabled feeds from Reader to be displayed on iGoogle (formerly Google Personalized Homepage).
Play.
In March 2010, Google announced and released Google Reader Play. Play presented a slideshow interface which displayed popular items one at a time. These items were drawn from assorted sites' feeds, and their appearance in Play was based on the data provided by Reader users' responses, e.g. how many people liked or shared the item. Unlike Google Reader, a Google Account was not required to access Play.
Discontinuation.
On March 13, 2013, Google announced they were discontinuing Google Reader, stating the product had a loyal but declining following, and they wanted to focus on fewer products. They gave users a sunset period until July 1, 2013, to move their data and suggested: "If you want to retain your Reader data, including subscriptions, you can do so through Google Takeout."
After the closure announcement, Feedly said that more than 500,000 new users had joined them in the following 48 hours, and 3 million in the following two weeks.
In response to the planned closure, Digg also announced plans to build a Google Reader replacement, rebuilding its API and adding features to take advantage of the implicit recommendations of social network activity.
As of July 2013, another popular alternative is InoReader, whose UI is very similar to Google Reader's.
Several petitions were started to keep Google Reader running, including one on Change.org with over 100,000 signatures.
Instapaper developer Marco Arment speculated that the real reason for the closure was to try to keep everyone reading and sharing information using Google+, and that it signaled the end of the era of unrestricted and interoperable web services like RSS from large organizations like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

Rho Aquarii

Rho Aquarii (ρ Aqr, ρ Aquarii) is the Bayer designation for a binary star in the equatorial constellation of Aquarius. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +5.34. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, this star is at a distance of roughly from Earth.
This is a single-lined spectroscopic binary, with the presence of a companion being revealed by Doppler shifts in the spectrum. The primary is a giant star with a stellar classification of . It is a Mercury-Manganese star, showing a surfeit of these elements in the spectrum. With five times the Sun's mass, this star is radiating 1,035 times as much luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 12,593 K. This heat gives it the blue-white hue of a B-type star. The companion may be a variable star.

I'm Sorry (video game)

"I'm Sorry", known in Japan as , is an arcade game released by Coreland/Sega in 1985. This action game stars a caricature of former Prime Minister of Japan, Kakuei Tanaka. The title is actually a play on the Japanese word for Prime Minister, "Sori". The game satirizes Tanaka's greed by making the goal of the game acquiring gold bars. Oddly enough this game, with so much Japanese satire, made it into some of the United States arcades.
Gameplay.
The goal is for the greedy protagonist to collect all the gold bars while jumping over or defeating various enemies and obstacles in each maze-like level. Some of these enemies are: Giant Baba (a Japanese wrestler), a moonwalking Michael Jackson, Madonna, Japanese comedian Tamori, Carl Lewis, moving statues (activated when passed by). Some obstacles include: Gates, "fire" hydrants, safes (making it difficult to gain access to the gold), a rolling barrel, conveyor belts, and a swimming pool with platforms ranging in size and strength. When you collect all the gold in a given level, you must cash it into a building (labeled "out" when the level begins and "in" once you retrieve all the gold) to beat the level. The player can only hold ten bars of gold at once. In later levels there are more than 10 bars of gold, so the player must make multiple deposits.
Enemies.
Tamori, Michael Jackson, Carl Lewis, and Madonna can all be killed with one punch. Punching Giant Baba stuns him, more are required to actually kill him. The closer the player is to Giant Baba the faster he can be killed. Madonna has a range attack where she begins to jump and then launches a kiss at you. Carl Lewis jumps, so he can be walked under but he is more difficult to punch. When an enemy is killed it later respawns. The barrels cannot be killed.
If the player is caught by Tamori (the guy with the sunglasses), the player's clothes will change into a white diaper while the captor changes into a leather S&M bikini and lashes his whip on the crying protagonist's back.
Levels.
The game has 4 maps. After every 4 levels the game returns to first map. However, the difficulty of the map is increased by adding one of the following:
There are 32 distinct levels. Once level 32 is completed, the player returns to level 16.
Rarity.
The Video Arcade Preservation Society conducted a survey and found that of about 800 arcade machine collectors and their nearly 20,000 games, there aren't any instances of an "I'm Sorry" machine owned by a collector.

Dave Wakeling

Dave Wakeling (born David Wakeling, 19 February 1956) is an English rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He is most famous for singing and writing songs for the 1980s 2-Tone band The Beat (known in the U.S. as the English Beat) and also General Public.
He was born in Birmingham.
Career.
The first album by The Beat, "I Just Can't Stop It", was a hit and singles from this album included "Mirror in the Bathroom", "Hands Off She's Mine" and "Can't Get Used To Losing You" which all entered the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart. They also had UK hits from the albums "Wha'ppen?" and "Special Beat Service". In 1983 The Beat disbanded, citing, "every great band only has three really good albums".
Wakeling then formed General Public with Ranking Roger in 1984 and they released their debut album, "All the Rage". He would go on to record another two albums with General Public, "Hand To Mouth" (1986) and "Rub It Better" (1995), shortly after which the act would disband.
He then produced the soundtrack for the John Hughes film "She's Having a Baby" (1988), in which he also recorded the title track.
Wakeling released a solo album, "No Warning", on I.R.S. Records in 1991 and has lived in California for a number of years. He regularly performs as The English Beat in North America.
Dave Wakeling and his California-based version of the English Beat band recorded two new songs that feature prominently in the Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated episode "Dance of the Undead" which aired 26 March 2013. It features a zombie ska group called Rude Boy and the Ska-Tastics who come back to life in order to turn people into zombies and make them dance to ska music forever. According to an interview with the "San Francisco Examiner", he said: "This was my first opportunity to do anything for television as a gun for hire, and I actually managed to record and mix two songs in 12 hours. It was like running at double speed with no brakes, but it was exciting, and Warner Bros. really loved them. So the zombies have a song called 'You’re Dead Right, Mate,’ and the Hex Girls have one called 'We’re the Good Bad Girls,’ which has a definite Ramones-Runaways vibe to it, but frankly, I’m really happy I did it, because I’ve always loved ‘Scooby-Doo."
Personal life.
Wakeling resides in Santa Monica, California with his wife Damessa and their two children, Max and Chloe.
In a July 2012 interview with "New York Music News", Wakeling expressed concern over the United States' economic problems, stating: "I have a nose tuned to the smell of the death of an empire, and I smell it now."

José Coll y Cuchí

José Coll y Cuchí (January 12, 1877 – July 2, 1960) was a lawyer, writer and the founder of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. He was a member of a prominent Puerto Rican family of politicians, educators and writers.
Early years.
Coll y Cuchí was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. His father was Cayetano Coll y Toste, a historian who in 1913 was named the "Official Historian of Puerto Rico" and his mother Adela, was the daughter of José Cuchí y Arnau former mayor of Arecibo. His family sent him to private schools for his primary and secondary education. In 1896, Coll y Cuchí's family sent him to Spain where he earned his degree in law from the University of Barcelona. During his stay in Spain, he became interested in politics and became involved with the Puerto Rico's independence movement.
When Coll y Cuchí returned to Puerto Rico, he found himself with a totally different political situation. The island which once belonged to the Spanish Crown was now a territory of the American. This came about as part of the accord of the Treaty of Paris as a consequence of the outcome of the Spanish-American War.
Politician.
In 1904, he joined the Puerto Rican Republican Party and was elected to the Puerto Rican Chamber of Delegates. Believing that Puerto Rico's identity as a nation was threaten by the Foraker Law, he decided to join the Puerto Rican Union Party headed by Antonio R. Barceló and was re-elected to the Chamber of Delegates in 1908. As member of the Chamber, he led the fight against the Foraker Law, also known as the Organic Act of 1900, which established a civilian government in the island. The new government had an American governor and executive council appointed by the President of the United States.
By 1919, Coll y Cuchí felt that the Union Party wasn't doing enough for the cause of Puerto Rico and together with some followers departed from the party and formed the Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico in San Juan. By the 1920s there were two other pro-independence organizations in the Island: the Nationalist Youth and the Independence Association. The Independence Association was founded by José S. Alegría, Eugenio Font Suárez and Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa in 1920. Under Coll y Cuchi's presidency, the party was able to convince the Puerto Rican Legislature Assembly to approve an act that would permit the transfer of the mortal remains of Puerto Rican patriot Ramón Emeterio Betances from Paris, France to Puerto Rico. Betances' remains arrived in San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920 and a funeral caravan organized by the Nationalist Association transferred the remains from the capital to the town of Cabo Rojo where his ashes were interred by his monument.
Founding of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.
On September 17, 1922, the three political organizations joined forces and formed the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Coll y Cuchí was elected president, José S. Alegría (father of Ricardo Alegría) vice-president and Antonio Vélez Alvarado "The Father of the Puerto Rican Flag" to the party's Supreme Counsel. In 1924 Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and was named vice-president.
In 1927, Coll y Cuchí was invited to Columbia University to give a conference. At that conference the governor of New York Al Smith was present and congratulated Coll y Cuchí. When Smith ran for President of the U.S. in 1928, under the democratic ticket, he invited Coll y Cuchí to come to the U.S. and campaign for him among the Hispanic communities, which he did. The Nationalist Party did poorly in the 1928 elections, they only received 399 votes out of a total of 253,520 votes.
Despite the fact that he was a leader in the independence movement, Coll y Cuchí displayed respect and admiration towards the Americans. Albizu Campos did not like what he considered was Coll y Cuchí's attitude of fraternal solidarity with the enemy. By 1930, there were more disagreements between Coll y Cuchí and Albizu Campos as to how the party should be run. As a result Coll y Cuchí abandoned the party and some of his followers returned to the Union Party. On May 11, 1930, Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. In 1931, when President Herbert Hoover visited Puerto Rico, Coll y Cuchí urged the islanders to greet him with a warm welcome.
Notable family members.
Coll y Cuchí came from a prominent family of Puerto Rican educators, politicians and writers. His father Dr. Cayetano Coll y Toste (1850-1930), was a historian and writer. His brother Cayetano Coll y Cuchí, was a President of Puerto Rico House of Representatives. His daughter Edna Coll was a noted educator and author who founded the Academy of Fine Arts in Puerto Rico and his niece Isabel Cuchí Coll was a journalist, author and the Director of the "Sociedad de Autores Puertorriqueños" (Society of Puerto Rican Authors). His nephew (Edna's son) Jose "Fufi" Santori Coll is a former BSN basketball player, coach and television sportscaster.
Later years.
Coll y Cuchí was director of Puerto Rican Athaeneum's Political Sciences Section. He is the only Puerto Rican to have received the Medal of Honor from Spain's "Royal Academy of the Spanish Language" for the best book published during a five year span. Coll y Cuchí never abandoned his pro-independence ideals and continued to be active in the independence cause. José Coll y Cuchí died in Santurce, Puerto Rico on July 2, 1960.
Written works.
Among his written works are the following:

Garlock, California

Garlock (formerly, Eugeneville) is an unincorporated community in Kern County, California. It is located east-southeast of Saltdale, at an elevation of 2169 feet (661 m).
A post office operated at Garlock from 1896 to 1904 and from 1923 to 1926.
Garlock is a ghost town that was known as El Paso City or Cow Wells interchangeably. The little town provided water for cattlemen and freighters wishing to avoid the potentially treacherous washes in Red Rock Canyon. Some gold had been found in the canyons of the El Paso Mountains, enough to warrant an arrastre being built in 1887. In 1893 a nugget was brought in worth $1,900 from Goler Heights (former reference to Goler Canyon is located in Death Valley, NOT off Garlock Rd.) and so the rush began. In 1894 Eugene Garlock of Tehachapi moved in an eight stamp mill. Miners would talk of going down to "the Garlock mill," "down to the Garlock," and finally just "Garlock."
The site is now registered as California Historical Landmark #671.

Even Flow

"Even Flow" is a song by the American rock band Pearl Jam. Featuring lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard, "Even Flow" was released in 1992 as the second single from the band's debut album, "Ten" (1991). The song peaked at number three on the "Billboard" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, "rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991–2003)". A remixed version of the song was included on the 2009 "Ten" reissue.
Origin and recording.
"Even Flow" features lyrics written by vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, "I know it was a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it." Drummer Dave Krusen said, "I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation." He added that "it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better." Guitarist Mike McCready stated, "We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out."
An alternate version of the song was recorded with drummer Dave Abbruzzese in 1992 while the band was recording songs for the soundtrack for the 1992 film, "Singles". This version was used for the music video, and was used in single releases in the United Kingdom. This version can also be readily found on Pearl Jam's 2004 greatest hits album, "rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991–2003)".
Composition and lyrics.
"Even Flow" was written in the key of D major, with Gossard performing his parts in open D tuning and McCready complementing it with a similar rhythm pattern in standard tuning. The recorded version of the song actually sounds slightly sharper than D major, with everything tuned up — accidentally or otherwise — around one quarter of a step. The song features a funk guitar riff by Gossard.
McCready on the song:
That's me pretending to be Stevie Ray Vaughan, and a feeble attempt at that. Stone (Gossard, Pearl Jam guitarist) wrote the riff and song; I think it's a D tuning. I just followed him in a regular pattern. I tried to steal everything I know from Stevie Ray Vaughan and put it into that song. A blatant rip-off. A tribute rip-off, if you will!
The vocal line that appears in the main verse begins with a very prominent tritone interval.
The stark lyrics by Vedder for "Even Flow" describe the experience of being a homeless man. The subject sleeps "on a pillow made of concrete" and panhandles passersby for spare change. In addition to being illiterate, he may also be mentally ill, as he "looks insane" when he smiles and struggles to keep coherent thoughts ("Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies/Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away").
At Pearl Jam's March 28, 1994 concert at the Bayfront Amphitheater in Miami, Florida, Vedder introduced the song by saying, "I thought I'd throw in a bit of street education while you still have an open mind...Right across the street there's a little homeless community that lives under the bridge. You should just know that those people ain't all crazy and sometimes it's not their fault. This song is called 'Even Flow'."
Release and reception.
While the "Even Flow" single was released commercially to international markets in 1992, the commercial single was not released in the United States until June 27, 1995 and was only available as a more expensive import version beforehand. The alternate studio recording of "Even Flow", which was recorded in 1992 with Abbruzzese, was released as a CD single and 12-inch white vinyl in the United Kingdom. The original version was used in single releases in the United States. The song was released as a single in 1992 with a previously unreleased B-side titled "Dirty Frank", which can also be found as an extra track on European releases of "Ten" and as an alternate version on the compilation album, "Lost Dogs" (2003).
The song peaked at number three on the "Billboard" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 21 on the "Billboard" Modern Rock Tracks chart. Outside the United States, the single was released commercially in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Canada, the song reached the top 80 on the Canadian Singles Chart. "Even Flow" peaked at number 27 in the UK and number 22 on the Australian Singles Chart. It was a moderate top 20 success in New Zealand.
Chris True of Allmusic called "Even Flow" "the somewhat less ballady more swaggering follow up to the breakout single 'Alive'." True said that the song "doesn’t even really have an intro—it just starts and keeps going—and the band seems more in the groove than on the overly earnest 'Alive'." True said that the song "confirmed that Pearl Jam were more than just one hit grunge rock wonders." The song was placed at number 77 on a list of "The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time" by "Rolling Stone". It was also included on VH1's countdown of the "100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs" at number 30.
Music video.
Original video.
Pearl Jam originally hired director Rocky Schenck to film a music video for "Even Flow". On January 31, 1992, on their way to England to begin a European tour, the band members came to Los Angeles, California to film the video. The concept for the video was based on an idea by Gossard. Schenck filmed Pearl Jam in a zoo setting. He had arranged a nighttime shoot at an old, closed facility, brought in different wildlife, and set up his lights among the cages and in the trees. Along with the animal footage, the members of Pearl Jam were filmed individually and as a band, standing on the side of a cliff and air jamming. The shoot took hours, and the band was not pleased with the end result. Schenck's shoot was considered a waste of time and money by the band; it also damaged Abbruzzese's wrists significantly. After shooting had finished, he was taken to the emergency room where he was advised not to put strain on his wrists. Abbruzzese would drum on the band's European tour with a splint attached to his hands.
Official video.
The original music video for "Even Flow" was ultimately replaced by a performance clip directed by Josh Taft, who had previously directed the "Alive" music video for the band, and who would later direct the music video for "Oceans". The video consists of performance footage of the band filmed during a January 17, 1992 show at the Moore Theatre in Seattle, Washington. Taft was filming that night not in his capacity as a director, but as a friend of Gossard's. (At one point during the show, Vedder had even stopped the proceedings, clearly of the opinion that Taft's presence was intrusive. "This is not a TV studio, Josh" he'd yelled indignantly, in an interlude that Taft left in his final cut but that MTV clipped out of most versions it aired. "Turn those lights out, it's a fucking rock concert!") The video shows Vedder climbing the theatre, and then jumping down between fans at the concert and ending with Gossard throwing his guitar towards the camera.
The footage used in the video is actually spliced from different songs: for instance Gossard and McCready each play two different guitars, Vedder wears a hat at some point and the theatre climb actually occurred during "Porch". Taft's presence at the Moore Theatre show, and the fact that he had filmed sufficient footage to compile into a music video, proved to be a break for the band. Otherwise with Epic ready to provide MTV with an "Even Flow" video and Schenck's version already completed, Pearl Jam would have had little choice but to go with it, and the band members unanimously despised Schenck's version when they saw the final edit. The alternate studio recording of "Even Flow", which was recorded in 1992 with Abbruzzese, was used for the video as the band felt it synched up well with the live footage. The video was released in April 1992.
Live performances.
"Even Flow" was first performed live at the band's October 22, 1990 concert in Seattle, Washington at the Off Ramp Café. Pearl Jam performed the song for its appearance on "MTV Unplugged" in 1992. "Even Flow" has gone on to become the band's most performed live song, having been played over 700 times (the next most played song, "Alive", is at over 620 performances). Over the years, the tempo of the song has become slightly faster in live performances. Live performances of "Even Flow" can be found on the "Dissident" single, the live album "Live on Two Legs", the compilation album "Wild and Wooly: The Northwest Rock Collection", various official bootlegs, the live album "Live in NYC 12/31/92", the "Live at the Gorge 05/06" box set, the live album "Live at Lollapalooza 2007", and the "Drop in the Park" LP included in the Super Deluxe edition of the "Ten" reissue. Performances of the song are also included on the DVDs "Touring Band 2000", "Live at the Garden", "Immagine in Cornice", and the "MTV Unplugged" DVD included in the "Ten" reissue. On "Live at the Garden", McCready performs an improv within "Even Flow" that goes on for nearly five minutes.

Brookfield High School (Connecticut)

Brookfield High School is a public high school in Brookfield, Fairfield County, Connecticut. 
In the 2006-2007 school year the school had roughly 1000 students. This steep increase was due to one of the largest freshman classes ever, with over 300 people. Ethnically the students are approximately 97% Caucasian, 0.12% Black, 0.3% Asian, 2.6% Hispanic.
The school is located at 45 Longmeadow Hill Road. Recently, a new library, video production studio, and two new wings were added as the existing rooms were updated. In August 2009, the senior parking lot was repaved. The school is no longer under continuous construction.
In the 2009-2010 school year, Brookfield High School switched to block scheduling. Eight class periods are spread over two days, termed "A" and "B" days, with four class periods in a day. Classes then meet every other day. This allows more time for instruction and activities during class and homework outside of class.
The school mascot is the Bobcat and the school colors are blue and gold. Both white and black have also been used in team uniforms.

Waiau, Canterbury

Waiau is a small town in north Canterbury, in the South Island of New Zealand. It lies east of Hanmer Springs on the northern bank of the Waiau River, some from the river's mouth.
Waiau is the largest town on State Highway 70, also known as the Inland Kaikoura Route. From 1919 until 1978, Waiau was the terminus of the Waiau Branch, a branch line railway that ran to the town from a junction with the Main North Line in Waipara. There were proposals to extend this line beyond Waiau as part of the Main North Line and some of formation was made for a route to Kaikoura, but construction ground to a halt and a coastal route via Parnassus and Hundalee was chosen for the Main North Line instead.
Waiau shares its name with several much smaller settlements and farming communities within New Zealand. The name is Maori, and means "flowing water".

Lewis Stadler

Lewis John Stadler (July 6, 1896 - May 12, 1954) was an American geneticist. His research focused on the mutagenic effects of different forms of radiation on economically important plants like maize and barley.
Biography.
Lewis John Stadler was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1896 to Henry Louis and Josephine Ehrman Stadler. Stadler's early education efforts were unremarkable, but two summers worked on Midwestern farms sparked an interest in agriculture. He began his undergraduate work at the University of Missouri and completed a B.S. in agriculture at the University of Florida (1917). Afterwards, he returned to the University of Missouri and earned the A.M. (1918). Post-A.M., he enrolled in the Field Artillery of the United States Army, although his commission as Second Lieutenant was not used in overseas duty due to the end of World War I. Stadler spent 1919 in graduate studies at Cornell University under H.H. Love and R.A. Emerson. He returned again to the University of Missouri and completed his Ph.D in 1922. Following graduation, he joined the University of Missouri Department of Field Crops faculty. Stadler remained at Missouri until 1954 and acted as a visiting professor at the California Institute of Technology (1940), and Yale University (1950). He simultaneously held an appointment with the U.S. Department of Agriculture beginning in 1930. Stadler completed presidential terms for several academic organizations, including Genetics Society of America, American Society of Naturalists, and Sigma Xi.
While Stadler spent almost his entire academic life at the University of Missouri he was also involved in external activities. During the 1930s Stadler participated in efforts to bring European scientists to the U.S. to escape Nazism. In 1948 Stadler was appointed a delegate to the Eighth International Congress of Genetics, which met in Stockholm. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture rejected his passport application and conducted a loyalty investigation; Stadler initially thought it was a State Department action.
Stadler married Cornelia Field Tuckerman in 1919. They had six children: Maury, Henry, David, John, Eliot, and Joan.
Although Stadler's initial research was on field plot technique and agronomy, his main research interest became genetics, concentrated upon the study of mutation in corn. In 1925, he won a National Research Council Fellowship in Biology for a study in variation in linkage values in maize. He did much work on the effects of X-ray treatments, and did comparative studies of mutation caused by X-rays and by ultraviolet rays. His work earned him an international reputation.
He died of leukemia in 1954.
In his honor, the University of Missouri holds the Stadler Genetics Symposium every two years.

Chubby Jackson

Greig Stewart "Chubby" Jackson (October 25, 1918 – October 1, 2003) was an American jazz double-bassist and band leader.
Biography.
Born in New York City, Jackson began at the age of seventeen as a clarinetist, but quickly changed to bass.
Jackson performed and/or recorded with Louis Armstrong, Raymond Scott, Jan Savitt, Henry Busse, Charlie Barnet, Oscar Pettiford, Charlie Ventura, Lionel Hampton, Bill Harris, Woody Herman, Gerry Mulligan, Lennie Tristano and others. He is perhaps best known for his spirited work both with the Herman bands, and as a leader of his own bands, big and small.
In the 1950s, Jackson worked as a studio musician, freelanced, and hosted some local children's TV shows: "Chubby Jackson's Little Rascals", which was seen weekday mornings on WABC TV Ch. 7 in NYC from Monday March 23, 1959, to Friday July 14, 1961, and "The Chubby Jackson Show", Saturday afternoons on WABC TV Ch.7 from July 22, 1961, to August 5, 1961.
Jackson would host his last two kids' TV shows for WOR TV Ch.9 in NYC "Space Station Nine," which was seen weekday evenings from Monday January 1, 1962, to Friday January 26, 1962, and he briefly served as the fourth and last emcee of WOR TV's "Looney Tunes Show"/"The Chubby Jackson Show" weekday afternoons. The last series was seen from Monday January 12, 1962, to Friday June 14, 1962. (Information can be found on Jackson's local NYC kids TV shows in The NYC Kids Shows Round Up section of "TV Party.Com")
In 2000, Jackson was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.
He died in Rancho Bernardo, California (in the Poway area), at the age of 84.
His son Duffy Jackson is now a prominent jazz drummer who toured with the Count Basie Orchestra and appeared in the 2008 film, "Revolutionary Road" as a 1950s musician.
His daughter Jaijai Jackson, noted radio personality and jazz promoter, created a social community dedicated to her father's contribution to jazz and the entertainment world entitled The Jazz Network Worldwide. This is where musicians from all over the world find each other and network with all the supporting roles of business that gives jazz its heartbeat.

<doc id="2859356" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2859356" title="Pipeline video inspection">
Pipeline video inspection

"Pipeline video inspection"' is a form of telepresence used to visually inspect the interiors of pipelines. A common application is to determine the condition of small diameter sewer lines and household connection pipes.
Older sewer lines of small diameter, typically , are made by the union of a number of short sections. The pipe segments may be made of cast iron, with to sections, but are more often made of vitrified clay pipe (VCP), a ceramic material, in , & sections. Each iron or clay segment will have an enlargement (a "bell") on one end to receive the end of the adjacent segment. Roots from trees and vegetation may work into the joins between segments and can be forceful enough to break open a larger opening in terra cotta or corroded cast iron. Eventually a root ball will form that will impede the flow and this may cleaned out by a cutter mechanism and subsequently inhibited by use of a chemical foam - a "rooticide".
With modern video equipment the interior of the pipe may be inspected - this is a form of non-destructive testing. A small diameter collector pipe will typically have a cleanout access at the far end and will be several hundred feet long, terminating at a manhole. Additional collector pipes may discharge at this manhole and a pipe (perhaps of larger diameter) will carry the effluent to the next manhole, and so forth to a pump station or treatment plant.
Inspection equipment.
Service truck.
The service truck contains a power supply in the form of a small generator, a small air-conditioned compartment containing video monitoring and recording equipment, and related computer and display for feature recording.
Cable and winch.
At the back end of the truck is a powered reel with video cable reinforced with kevlar or steel wire braid. Some trucks also contain a powered winch that booms out from the truck allowing for lowering and retrieval of the inspection equipment from the pipeline.
Inspection camera.
Sometimes referred to as a PIG (pipeline inspection gauge), the camera and lights are mounted in a swiveling head attached to a cylindrical body. The camera head can pan and tilt remotely. Integrated into the camera head are lighting devices, typically LEDs, for illuminating the pipeline. The camera is connected to display equipment via a long cable wound upon a winch. Some companies, such as Rausch Electronics USA, incorporate a series of lasers in the camera to accurately measure the pipe diameter and other data.
Inspection process.
Using a camera tractor.
A run to be inspected will either start from an access pipe leading at an angle down to the sewer and then run downstream to a manhole, or will run between manholes.
The service truck is parked above the access point of the pipe. The camera tractor, with a flexible cable attached to the rear, is then lowered into the pipeline. The tractor is moved forward so that it is barely inside of the pipeline. A "down-hole roller" is set up between the camera tractor and the cable reel in the service truck, preventing cable damage from rubbing the top of the pipeline. The operator then retires to the inside of the truck and begins the inspection, remotely operating the camera tractor from the truck. When the inspection is complete or the camera cable is fully extended, the camera tractor is put in reverse gear and the cable is wound up simultaneously. When the camera tractor is near the original access point, the downhole roller is pulled up and the camera tractor is moved into the access point and pulled up to the service truck. A tractor may be used to inspect a complete blockage or collapse that would prevent using a fish and rope as described below.
Pulling the camera backwards.
For small diameter pipes there may not be enough room for the tractor mechanism. Instead, a somewhat rigid "fish" is pushed through the pipe and attached to a rope at the access point near the truck. The fish is then pulled to place the rope along the pipe. The rope is then used to pull the inspection pig and cable through the pipe. Detaching the rope, the cable is then used to pull the pig backwards as the pipe is inspected on the monitor (this is the method shown in the illustrations below).
Analysis of video footage.
Much of the analysis of what was viewed in the pipeline is conducted at the time of the inspection by the camera operator, but the entire inspection is always recorded and saved for review.
Using software you can easily record digital video and simplify the analysis process, here are some samples of different applications available on the market:
Data use.
Depending mostly upon the change in conditions from a previous inspection various improvements may be made to the pipe. It may be cleaned with a rotating root cutting blade on the end of a segmented rotating chain, or a chemical foam may be applied to discourage root growth. If damage is found limited to only a few locations these may be excavated and repaired. Extensive moderate defects may be repaired by lining with a fabric liner that is pulled through the pipe, inflated, and then made rigid through chemical means. Severe damage may require excavation and replacement of the pipe with more modern materials.

Gooch crucible

A Gooch crucible, named after Frank Austen Gooch, is a filtration device for laboratory use (and was also called a Gooch filter). It is convenient for collecting a precipitate directly within the vessel in which it is to be dried, possibly ashed, and finally to be weighed in gravimetric analysis.
The device was originally a standard platinum laboratory crucible with a perforated base into which asbestos pulp was placed to form the filter mat. The crucible was then heated in an oven to dry out until it attained constant weight The use of these materials meant that after filtration, the crucible and its contents could be subjected to high temperature to dry the filtrate and possible oxidize, or ash it to minimum weight. However, because of the high cost of platinum, versions made of porcelain were introduced in 1882. Some Gooch crucibles, such as the one in the drawing, permit two layers of asbestos to be used, separated by a perforated porcelain plate.
Other inorganic fibers, notably glass, have been used in place of asbestos. Gooch crucibles made of borosilicate glass with fritted glass bases are more common today. Platinum may still be required for the most corrosive materials, and porcelain ones are used where ashing at high temperature is required, but the borosilicate glass ones are adequate for drying.
They may also be used for collection and processing of biological tissue samples within the same container.

<doc id="2859384" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2859384" title="Flat white">
Flat white

A flat white is a coffee beverage developed in Australia and New Zealand in the 1980s. It is prepared by pouring microfoam (steamed milk with small, fine bubbles and a glossy or velvety consistency) over a double shot of espresso (sometimes ristretto espresso). It is somewhat similar to the cappuccino or the latte although smaller in volume, therefore having a higher proportion of coffee to milk (closer to a cortado), and milk that is more velvety in consistency – allowing the espresso to dominate the flavour, while being supported by the milk.
Description.
The beverage is typically served in a small 150–160 millilitre ceramic cup. Microfoam is used, and loosely frothed milk from the top of the steaming vessel is typically discarded or held back in the vessel while the creamy milk from the bottom of the vessel is folded into the coffee, resulting in a smooth and velvety texture. A flat white may incorporate latte art.
According to a survey of industry commentators, a flat white has several defining characteristics: 
Flat whites are typically prepared using espresso beans with a relatively light roast rather than more traditional dark Italian roasts. This fact, together with proper extraction by a skilled barista and the fact that double shots are typically used, creates the characteristically rich and intense, though not bitter, aroma of a flat white. This is another reason why flat whites are predominantly found in third wave cafes, since they typically use only lightly roasted beans anyway.
History.
Australian food historian, Michael Symons, claims that the name "flat white", meaning an espresso with milk, originated in Sydney, Australia, in the mid-1980s, in contrast to the terms "short black" and "long black". The style was developed and standardised in Wellington, New Zealand, in the late 1980s. The style was exported to the United Kingdom by expatriates from both New Zealand and Australia in 2005 and by 2010 was being sold in Starbucks franchises in the United Kingdom.
With the post–World War II influx of Italian immigrants to Australia and the introduction of espresso coffee machines in the 1950s, a "flat white" was requested in Italian cafés where the cappuccino was generally prepared and served. The milk poured was as much for tea as for coffee. The style developed and standardized in the late 1980s is an appropriation of that common term.
Outside of Australia and New Zealand, a cafe offering a flat white was once a sign that it considered itself part of the Third Wave Coffee movement of independent artisanal coffee making. However, with the flat white becoming increasingly well known, many cafes who are not part of the specialty coffee movement are also offering flat whites - for example in the UK, large coffee shop chains such as Starbucks, Costa Coffee, Cafe Nero and Pret a Manger have added flat whites to their menus.
Similar beverages.
A cappuccino is similar, but in many countries has a head of dry foam rather than microfoam. A flat white is similar to an original Italian cappuccino, which is a single espresso with microfoam served in a 150–160 ml cup.
The Spanish cafe con leche is similar, but uses scalded milk. In a flat white, the milk is steamed without frothing to 60–70 °C (typically 150–170 °F). Steaming the milk to this temperature retains the fats and proteins in the milk which retain a sweet flavour, lost when milk is steamed to scalding temperatures. A Cafe con Leche also lacks the head of microfoam.
The flat white and thelatte are also similar with some people incorrectly suggesting that: ""The only difference between the two drinks is the vessel in which they're presented. A flat white is served in a ceramic cup, usually of the same volume (200 millilitres) as a latte glass. However, some cafes will top a latte with extra froth, while others may pour a flat white slightly shorter."" In both Australia and New Zealand, there is a generally accepted difference between lattes and flat whites in the ratio of milk to coffee and the consistency of the milk due to the way the milk is heated. The milk in a flat white shouldn’t be frothed.

Malik Ayaz

Malik Ayaz, son of Aymáq Abu'n-Najm, was a Turkish slave from Georgia who rose to the rank of officer and general in the army of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni (also known as "Mahmud Ghaznavi)". His rise to power was a reward for the devotion he bore his master.
In 1021, the Sultan raised Ayaz to kingship, awarding him the throne of Lahore, which the Sultan had taken after a long siege and a fierce battle in which the city was torched and depopulated. As the first Muslim governor of Lahore, he rebuilt and repopulated the city. He also added many important features, such as a masonry fort, which he built in the period of 1037-1040 on the ruins of the previous one, demolished in the fighting, and city gates (as recorded by Munshi Sujan Rae Bhandari, author of the "Khulasatut Tawarikh" (1596 C.E.). The present Lahore Fort is built in the same location. Under his rulership the city became a cultural and academic center, renowned for poetry.
The tomb of Malik Ayaz can still be seen in the Rang Mahal commercial area of town.
Road named after Ayaz in Pakistan.
There is a road bearing the name of Ayaz in the city of Gujar Khan, Pakistan. The road name is Hayatsar Road. Hayatsar was initially known as "Ayazsar" before being renamed as Hayatsar. It is believed that Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi ordered Ayaz to choose an area for the accommodation of soldiers before war with Rajput. Ayaz chosen land, which is now called Gujar Khan.

The Daily Northwestern

The Daily Northwestern is a student newspaper at Northwestern University that is published on weekdays during the academic year. Established in 1881 and published in Evanston, Illinois, it is run entirely by undergraduates, many of whom are students at Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism.
The Daily is widely considered one of the best college newspapers in the country. It is a frequent winner of the Columbia Scholastic Press Association and the coveted Associated Collegiate Press Pacemaker Award. Its former staffers are leaders in the world of journalism; many have won awards such as the Pulitzer Prize.
Although it serves the Northwestern community, The Daily is unaffiliated with the university, being supported entirely by advertisers. It is owned by the Students Publishing Company, which also publishes the Northwestern Syllabus yearbook. Current circulation is in excess of 7,500. The Daily Northwestern is the only daily publication for both Northwestern and the city of Evanston, Illinois.
The paper's offices are located on the third floor of the Norris University Center on Northwestern's Evanston campus.
Early history.
The Daily is the descendant of two earlier publications, the "Tripod" and "Vidette", the older of which began publishing in 1871 alongside or ahead of the earliest college newspapers in the United States. In 1881, in what is considered The Daily's founding moment, the two papers merged to become "The Northwestern", only gradually shedding its literary-journal roots. Publication was increased to five days a week by 1910. The newspaper became independent of the university in 1923.

Dancing Man

The Dancing Man is the name given to the man who was filmed dancing on the street in Sydney, Australia, after the end of World War II. On 15 August 1945, a reporter took note of a man's joyful expression and dance and asked him to do it again. The man consented and was caught on motion picture film in an Australian edition of the newsreel Movietone News. The film and stills from it have taken on iconic status in Australian history and culture, and symbolise victory in the war.
Identity.
There has been much debate as to the identity of the dancing man. Frank McAlary, a retired barrister claims that he was the man photographed pirouetting in Elizabeth Street, Sydney, on 15 August 1945. A Queen's Counsel, Chester Porter, and a former Compensation Court judge, Barry Egan, both claim to have seen Mr. McAlary being filmed dancing. The television programme "Where Are They Now", produced by Australia's Seven Network, attempted to solve the mystery of the dancing man's identity. The network hired a forensic scientist who examined the film reel and picture and came to the conclusion that it was indeed McAlary.
The Royal Australian Mint, however, chose to portray Ern Hill as the dancing man on a 2005 issue $1 coin commemorating 60 years since the World War II armistice. Mr. Hill has made a statement that, "The camera came along and I did a bit of a jump around." The coin, sculpted by Wojciech Pietranik, does not bear any name. 
Rebecca Keenan of Film World Pty. Ltd., says the dancer may be Patrick Blackall. Mr. Blackall has claimed, "I'm the genuine dancing man," and has signed statutory declarations that he is the man in the film.

Curt Stern

Curt Stern (August 30, 1902 – October 23, 1981) was a German-born American geneticist.
Life and Death.
Curt Jacob Stern was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Hamburg, Germany on August 30, 1902. He was the first son of Earned S. Stern, born 1862 in England, who was interned during WWI. and Anna Stern, née Anna Liebrecht was a schoolteacher.(b.1873) . Her father C. Liebrecht was a teacher at the Israelitische Gemeindeschule Gleiwitz a "Gymnasium" in Upper Silesia, with a PhD in mathematics and natural sciences at the University of Breslau. His father dealt in antiques and dental supplies, and his mother was a schoolteacher. The family moved to a suburb of Berlin shortly after his birth. As a child, he showed a strong interest in biology and natural history. He went to the "Hindenburgschule" in Berlin-Oberschoeneweide. Supported by two high school teachers and his parents, he decided to study zoology. He entered the University of Berlin in 1920 at age 18.
Stern conducted his doctoral studies at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut, which was a one to two hour commute each way from his home. He chose the lab of Max Hartmann, a protozoologist, to study the reproduction of a protozoan of the order Heliozoa. In 1923 after only 3 years, he received a Ph.D. for the description of its mitosis, the youngest person to receive a PhD from the university at that time. "To achieve his degree so early under these circumstances was an early, clear signal of the remarkable combination of high intellectual ability, photographic memory, and stamina that was to characterize his career." 
Stern had read and critiqued a paper on the basis for crossing-over by Richard Goldschmidt, the 45 year old director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology. Six months later Goldschmidt returned the critique to Stern without comment, called him into his office and offered him a post-graduate fellowship financed by the Rockefeller University at Columbia University, N.Y. to study genetics in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, the famous "Fly Room", so-named for the fruit fly Drosophila, the subject of genetic research for Morgan.
Stern lived in New York City from 1924-1926. In 1926 his very first paper written in English was published in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academies of Science. After his fellowship, Stern returned to his alma mater, the University of Berlin, where he stayed for 6 very productive years from 1926-1932 as an investigator until he became a professor in 1928. There, he wrote the first two of his 5 books (Multiple Allelie, Handbuch der Vererbungswissenschaften, I. Berlin: Gebr. Borntraeger.147 pp. 193 and Faktorenkoppelung und Faktorenaustausch, 1933) and 35 papers.
Most articles were about Drosophila genetics, but two hinted at areas he would pick up much later: one 1928 article delved into the topic of human genetics, and another one from 1929 about mutagenic effects of radiation.
On October 29, 1931 Curt Stern married Evelyn Sommerfield, an American citizen, whom he had met 1925 at Columbia University. During 1932 he returned to the U.S. for a one-year fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, spent at the California Institute of Technology. He was in the company of geneticists Thomas Morgan, Alfred Henry Sturtevant, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Calvin Bridges, Rollins Adams Emerson, C.D. Darlington, Berwind P. Kaufmann, Drosophila geneticist Jack Schultz, and yeast geneticist Carl C Lindegren. The year 1933 marks the year both of his last publication in German for 22 years to come, the year Hitler had come to power and Curt and Evelyn's decision to live in the US. Evelyn had returned to Germany to investigate in-person whether or not it was safe for him to return to Germany, seeking advice from his academic colleagues. The decision was forced by Hitler enacting an Aryan paragraph in April 1933 limiting public service to Aryans.
After a temporary position at Case Western Reserve University in 1933, he accepted a research associate position at University of Rochester the same year, where he moved through the ranks to assistant professor in 1937, associate professor 1937-41 He became an American citizen in 1939. Curt and Evelyn had three daughters: Hildegard (1935), Holly Elizabeth (1938), and Barbara Ellen. Stern had brought his parents to live with his family in what became a suburb of Rochester, Brighton, Monroe County, New York. In 1941 Stern had become a full professor. From 1941 to 1947 he was chairman of the Department of Zoology and chairman of the Division of Biological Sciences.
After 11 years in NY state, he left for Berkley in 1947, age 45 to follow in the footsteps of his mentor Richard Golschmidtr at the University of California at Berkeley where he had numerous doctoral students until his retirement in 1970.
Curt Stern was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1970. His last public address was in 1973. Within 4 years his intellectual abilities had declined to such a degree, that he would not speak publicly any more. He died of complications of Parkinson's disease, i.e. cardiac failure on October 23, 1981,In Sacramento, CA at the age of 79.
Stern's work.
In 1931, Stern was the first to demonstrate crossover of homologous chromosomes in "Drosophila melanogaster", only weeks after Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton had done so in maize (corn).
In 1936, he demonstrated that recombination can also take place in mitosis resulting in somatic mosaics, organisms that contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissues. He later demonstrated that there were multiple genes on the "Drosophila" Y chromosome, and described the mechanism of dosage compensation.
After World War II had begun, Stern fully entered the field of human genetics, supervising his first graduate student seminar in 1939, selecting "what little solid data existed", as explained by his former student Neely. Stern's seminar was a rational response to the perverted ideas of genetics feeding racist theories of national socialist movements racial hygiene, so prominent in Europe and the U.S. at that time, culminating in eugenics which had made it impossible for him to continue to live in Germany.
During World War II, he led research for the American government on low-dose radiation safety, building on work he had started in Berlin. His laboratory group concluded that there is no "safe" threshold below which radiation is not harmful.
Re-founding human genetics.
After the war, his research focused on human genetics, pioneering in what is now known as gene regulation. Although not a physician, he engaged in clinical work in human genetics. In 1943 he began teaching a course in human genetics to medical students at the University of Rochester. The first edition of Stern's pioneering textbook "The Principles of Human Genetics" was published in 1949, which he said in an autobiographical sketch from 1974 he wrote to feed the needs of premedical students. Both his teaching and his textbook were instrumental in re-founding human genetics on a non-racist basis, in sharp contrast with pre-war German and American traditions in the subject. Stern was a signatory of the 1950 UNESCO statement "The Race Question", a statement by leading scientists in many fields, that questioned the validity and scientific foundations of racial theories and eugenics.
Notably, Stern made the effort to translate his human genetics textbook into German, which became the first publication in his mother tongue after a 22 year hiatus of silence, and was published in 1955 Only two more articles published in German language journals followed, besides the hundreds in English. He must have continued to read German science books, as he reviewed them for Science for example 
Commemoration.
The Curt Stern Award, established by the American Society of Human Genetics in 2001, recognizes a scientist who has made major scientific achievements in human genetics during the past 10 years.

1 Police Plaza

1 Police Plaza (often abbreviated as 1PP) is the headquarters of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). The building is located on Park Row in downtown Manhattan near City Hall and the Brooklyn Bridge. Its block borders Park Row, Pearl Street, and Police Plaza.
The NYPD's previous headquarters was located at 240 Centre Street approximately one mile north of 1 Police Plaza.
Description.
Like Boston City Hall, 1 Police Plaza is rectangular in plan and is an inverted pyramid in elevation. It is a 13-level, horizontally-oriented brutalist building designed by Gruzen and Partners in 1973. A expansion project was completed in 2011.
Located on the eighth floor of 1 Police Plaza is the Real Time Crime Center, an anti-crime computer network which is essentially a large search engine and data warehouse operated by detectives to assist officers in the field with their investigations.
The Major Case Squad and the Technical Assistance Response Unit are also located at 1PP.
Criticism.
Park Row, historically a four-lane artery linking the financial district to Chinatown, has been closed to civilian traffic since 2001. The NYPD asserts that this is necessary to protect its headquarters from a truck bomb attack. Chinatown residents are increasingly frustrated at the disruption caused by the closure of the vital thoroughfare, especially nearby residents. People who live nearby argue that the police department has placed a choke hold on an entire neighborhood and that if One Police Plaza is such an obvious terrorist target, perhaps it should be moved from a residential area. Members of the Civic Center Residents Coalition have been fighting the security perimeter around the building for years.
Paul J. Browne, the NYPD's chief spokesman, said police headquarters will not be moving despite the numerous complaints from residents. He said the department had tried to alleviate the impact of the security measures by stopping officers from parking in nearby public spaces and reopening a stairway that skirts the headquarters south side and leads down to street level near the Brooklyn Bridge. The department also plans to redesign its guard booths and security barriers to make them more attractive, and is involved in efforts to convert two lanes of Park Row into a pedestrian green-way. “The Police Department has worked hard to be responsive to the community while maintaining the requisite level of security for this sensitive location,” he said.
Expansion.
A expansion of One Police Plaza is slated for completion in 2011. The project will not add any new floors to the building or any new employees to police headquarters, so the building’s impact will be minimal. The renovated building will have new computers and equipment. Angry Lower Manhattan residents held a rally on August 27, 2008 near One Police Plaza to protest the addition. Tenants of three neighboring co-ops filed a lawsuit to force the NYPD to undergo environmental and land use reviews.
Other.
1PP is also known to insiders as "the Puzzle Palace", although this term can also refer to the National Security Agency.
Inside 1 Police Plaza, a room on the second floor affectionately called "The Shack" serves as the police bureau office for local press outlets. Its tenants include the Associated Press, the "Daily News", "New York Post", "The New York Times", "Newsday", "Staten Island Advance", "El Diario La Prensa", NY1 News, and WINS Radio. Its police counterpart is on the 13th floor, the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Public Information (DCPI).
Inside 1PP is the "Fourteenth Floor", the NYPD commissioner's office.
In popular culture.
In literature.
Popular authors who feature the NYPD and NYC are: William J. Caunitz, Gabriel Cohen, Edward Dee, John Mackie, Dan Mahoney, and Joseph Wambaugh.
In television.
"One Police Plaza" was a made-for-TV movie which aired in 1986. It was a crime drama that about a veteran policeman's investigation of a woman's murder which led him to the discovery of corruption in high places.
The opening of each season of "" ends with an image of the main characters walking outside the One Police Plaza building.
1 PP is also in the TV series Blue Bloods. Commissioner Reagan is often seen in his office on the 14th floor.

Wakeful (horse)

Wakeful was one of the great Thoroughbred mares of the Australian turf. She had shown her versatility by defeating top racehorses at distances from 5½ furlongs to 3 miles. She was unplaced in only three races.
This bay filly was foaled in 1896, and was by the outstanding racehorse and sire, Trenton from Insomnia by Robinson Crusoe. Her pedigree contained mostly good old colonial bloodlines that had proved their worth in Australian racing and breeding. She was offered at the St Aubins stud dispersal sale in 1900 and purchased by Leslie Macdonald for the bargain price of 310 guineas.
Racing record.
Wakeful did not commence racing until she was four because of shin soreness. At her third start she won the VATC Oakleigh Plate, followed that by winning the VRC Newmarket Handicap and then the AJC Doncaster Handicap in a race record time of 1:39.75.
Taken to Sydney in 1902, she won all her four starts including the Sydney Cup carrying the impost of , and ran a race record. Wakeful then went on to win races such as the AJC Plate and VRC Champion Stakes at three miles.
At her last start she ran second in the 1903 VRC Melbourne Cup carrying the huge impost for a mare of which was 13 pounds over weight for age and conceded the winner Lord Cardigan . Previously no mare had carried more than and none of them finished in the first six. In all she had 44 starts, winning 25 races, was second 12 times and third 4 times.
Stud record.
After finishing racing and going to stud, Wakeful produced ten foals including the 1918 Melbourne Cup winner Night Watch. Some of her other colts were Blairgour (1907) and Baverstock (1911).
Honours.
The Wakeful Stakes is a Group 2 race named in her honour, in which 13 fillies have gone on to win the Oaks. In 2002 Wakeful was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.

Becky Godwin

Rebecca 'Becky' Godwin (born 1954 Richmond, Virginia, USA; died 1968 Virginia Beach, Virginia) was the adopted daughter and only child of the then Governor of Virginia Mills E. Godwin, Jr. (1914-1999) and Katherine Beale Godwin, of Chuckatuck, Virginia, a small community then in Nansemond County which is now a part of Suffolk. 
In August 1968, Becky Godwin, aged fourteen, was spending a day with her mother at Virginia Beach while her father, then in his first term as Virginia governor, attended the 1968 Democratic Convention. With the customary state police nearby, she had just stepped out of the surf onto the sand when she was struck by lightning. Several people were in the vicinity either on the beach or in the surf, but Godwin was the only one affected. It was a clear sunny day with no storms in the area. Although rushed to a hospital, she never regained consciousness. 
Memorials.
There are three scholarships set up in Becky Godwin's name. There is the Becky Godwin Memorial college scholarship fund for the young people of Chuckatuck, Virginia and the Becky Godwin Fund at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Nursing. At Mills E. Godwin High School in Henrico County, the Becky Godwin Memorial Award is given annually to a senior selected by classmates. At Virginia Wesleyan College, there is the Becky Katherine Godwin Memorial Scholarship. Governor Godwin was a founding Trustee of the College.

Xia Meng

Xia Meng (Chinese: 夏夢; a.k.a. Hsia Moon or Miranda Yang; born Yang Meng (楊濛) on 16 February 1932 in Shanghai, China) is a Hong Kong actress and film producer. She was the key figure of Hong Kong's Left Wing Mandarin movie scene.
Debut on stage.
Hsia Moon was first exposed to drama and stage play in McTyeire School, an elite girls' school established by Methodist missionaries in Shanghai. In 1947, Miranda Yang Meng moved with her family to Hong Kong, where she attended Maryknoll Convent School. In 1949, In conjunction with school's event, She was chosen to play the leading role in school's English language production of Saint Joan.
Film career.
How Xia Meng stepped into movie industry was in fact an unintentional one. In 1950, curiosity has driven Yang Meng and her friends to visit the film set of Great Wall Movie Enterprises Ltd, and this was where she was first spotted by the crews, as well as Studio manager Yuan Yang An.
Through the help of his daughter Mao Mei (later a movie star and Hong Kong Ballerina), Yang Meng accepted Yuan's invitation and joined the studio in the age of 17. Inspired by Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, the new actress now renamed Xia Meng (literally means Summer dream) by Yuan, which Yuan metaphorically wished her dream come true as she joined the studio in summer.
The Great Wall Crown Princess.
Xia Meng was given her first role as the title character in Li Ping Qian's A Night-Time Wife (1951). The comedy was a hit and rocketed Hsia Moon to stardom. Many other hits followed. There was the tragic demimondaine of Cao Yu's classic adaptation Sunrise, at her best as the virtuous widow of A Widow’s Tears (both 1956), The scapegoat of the feudal moral value in the critically acclaimed Hong Kong classic The Eternal Love (1960), the deprived bourgeoisie in HKFA Archival Gem's Romance of The Boudoir (1960), and perhaps most remarkably, her gender-bending turn as a man masquerading as a woman in The Bride Hunter (1960) as well as the one of the most memorable, a massive hit during its premiere in Singapore and Hong Kong Princess Falls in Love (1962); both features are the all-female Shaoxing opera comedy.
Xia Meng was the prima donna of Hong Kong left wing Mandarin movie scene, and also one of the Chinese language cinema brightest movie stars in 1950s–1960s. In 1959, Xia Meng emerged as the most actress in the Hong Kong Top Ten Mandarin Movie Star Election, organized by The Great Wall Pictorial . She is dubbed as the 'Crown Princess' of Great Wall alongside the other leading ladies of the Studio. (The 'second princess' is Shi Hui (Shek Hwei), while the 'third princess' is Chen Sisi (Chan Sze Sze))
A rare actress who embodied the beauties of a modern woman and those of a historical maiden, Xia Meng was often described as "the God's Masterpiece", and she was one of the few Hong Kong movie stars whose films were released in the People's Republic of China before the Cultural Revolution, she exuded glamour in a manner that was then no longer permitted among her mainland counterparts. The Mainland media nowadays have been frequently quoting her as the Chinese answer to Audrey Hepburn.
However, Hsia Moon films, together with other Hong Kong left-wing studio production, was banned in Taiwan during Cold War era. 
It has been widely reported that Jin Yong has deep affection towards Xia Meng, apparently Jin Yong joined the studio as a scriptwriter to be near her. She was Cha's muse, inspiring him to model the ethereal Xiaolongnü character in his novel The Return of the Condor Heroes on her. Although his devotion to her was unrequited as Xia Meng was already happily married to a businessman in 1954, But he remained infatuated even after Xia Meng left showbiz in 1967. To Jin Yong, her leaving Hong Kong for good was a big newsworthy event. For days, he splashed the news with front-page headlines in the newspaper he founded, Ming Pao Daily News.
Cultural Revolution.
1967 summer, Xia Meng visited Guangzhou and witnessed the chaotic situation where the Cultural Revolution had just started. The dire effect was soon to be felt on Hong Kong's Studios which were influenced by Communist Party of China, and Great Wall's movies would no longer had the same cachet as before. Xia Meng realized the facts and she did not agree with that, as well as the Cultural Revolution after the visit.
Feeling insecure and threaten, Xia Meng who was pregnant at the time excused herself from involved in this grand political movement. Hence, soon after she finished the screen performance in Oh, The Spring Is Here (1967), she resigned from studio in September, and quietly left for Canada even before the film was released. It wasn't until two years later that she returned to Hong Kong, and started the business in garment manufacturing, which she kept a distance from the film industry for about 10 years.
Return as movie producer.
After the end of The Cultural Revolution, Xia Meng was invited by Liao Chengzhi, vice chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) of that time, to attend the 4th National Congress of China Federation of Literary and Art Circles(CFLAC) held in Beijing from 30 October 1979 – 16 November 1979, which considered to be her first public appearance after her final screen performance in 1967. Under the encouragement of Liao, Xia Meng decided to re-embrace the film as movie producer, marked her return to movie industry after she waited for ten years.
In 1980, she formed Bluebird Movie Enterprises Ltd, and produced the debut film Boat People (Ann Hui, 1982), a movie and landmark feature for Hong Kong New Wave, which won several awards including the best picture and best director in the second Hong Kong Film Award. After producing Young Heroes (Mou Dunfei, 1983) and Homecoming (Yim Ho, 1984), Xia Meng sold her film company to Jiang Zu Yi. She does not officially involve in any movie production since then.
Awards.
Xia Meng's performance in Peerless Beauty (1953) and A Widow's Tears (1956) won her the Greatest Individual Achievement Award given by the Cultural Ministry of the People's Republic of China. In 1995, Xia Meng was honored the Chinese Film Stars Special Award, in conjunction with 90 anniversary of Chinese Cinema.
Political activities.
She was also involved in political activities, being selected as a committee member of the Chinese National Cultural Alliance and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. In the meanwhile, she has been the president of South China Film Industry Workers union before.
Tribute to Xia Meng.
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Xia Meng has a star with hand print and autograph by the name of Miranda Yang on the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade, Hong Kong.
In August 2005, China has honored 128 movie stars in a commemorative stamp collection marking 100 years of Chinese language cinema, Xia Meng was one of the honorees.

Troy Cooley

Troy James Cooley (born 9 December 1965 in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia) is a former first-class cricketer for the Tasmanian Tigers, and was bowling coach for the England cricket team for several years before returning to Australia in 2006.
Career.
Born in Launceston, Tasmania, Cooley played 33 first-class games and three one-day games for the Australian state. With the bat he scored 291 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 9.38 with a top score of 32 not out. In one-day domestic cricket with the bat he never had to bat in his 3 matches that he played. With the ball in first-class cricket he took 54 wickets at 61.35 with a best of 4/41 and in one-day domestic cricket with the ball he took 4 wickets at an average of 21.25 with a best of 
2/16.
Coaching.
He took up coaching for the Tasmanian Tigers as at one time or another an assistant coach to the state team, the state's junior development officer, fitness advisor, pace bowling coach and under-17 coach.
As the bowling coach for the England national team, he was considered instrumental in helping players such as Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison, Simon Jones, Matthew Hoggard and James Anderson amongst others improve their bowling, though the form of the latter after Cooley's intervention suggests otherwise.
Following the lack of an offer from the ECB, he left his post at the end of his contract in December 2005, and in May 2006 became the bowling coach for the Australian national team. The England Cricket Board (ECB) was criticised for letting him move as he was seen as a key figure in England's 2005 Ashes success. Following England's loss of the first test in The Ashes in Australia in 2006, former England captain Tony Greig commented that England missed Cooley. After England had lost the fourth test, Cooley commented that the English side has lost its "intensity", and was surprised at the team bringing back injured players like Ashley Giles who had little recent form.
At the end of the 2010–11 Ashes series, Cooley will become head coach of Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.

Epsilon Cassiopeiae

Epsilon Cassiopeiae (ε Cas, ε Cassiopeiae) is a star system in the constellation Cassiopeia. It has the traditional name Segin. With an apparent visual magnitude of 3.4, this is one of the brightest stars in the constellation. The distance to this star has been determined directly using parallax measurements, yielding a value of around .
Properties.
This is a giant star with a stellar classification of B3 III, indicating that it has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and entered a later evolutionary stages of its lifetime. Cote "et al." (2003) indicate that it displays the spectral properties of a Be star, even though it is not categorized as such. The presence of emission lines in the spectrum indicates the presence of a circumstellar shell of gas that has been thrown off by the star. The outer atmosphere of Epsilon Cassiopeiae has an effective temperature of 15,174 K, giving it the blue-white hue of a B-type star. The interferometer-measured angular diameter is 0.43 milliarcseconds. At the estimated distance of this star, this yields a physical size of roughly 6 times the radius of the Sun.
Observation of this star during the Hipparcos mission suggest that it may undergo weak periodic variability. The amplitude of this variation is 0.0025 in magnitude with a frequency of 11.17797 times per day, or one cycle every 2.15 hours. The signal-to-noise ratio for this measured variation is 4.978. Hipparcos measurements of the space velocity components for this star suggest that it is a member of the Cas-Tau group of co-moving stars, with a 93% likelihood. This group may be kinematically associated with the Alpha Persei Cluster, indicating that the Cas-Tau group, including Epsilon Cassiopeiae, may have been separated from the cluster through tidal interactions.
Etymology.
In Chinese, (), meaning "Flying Corridor", refers to an asterism consisting of ε Cassiopeiae, ι Cassiopeiae, δ Cassiopeiae, θ Cassiopeiae, ν Cassiopeiae and ο Cassiopeiae. Consequently, ε Cassiopeiae itself is known as (, .)
While some published reports incorrectly claim that this star was designated by NASA as Navi, in honor of astronaut Virgil Ivan "Gus" Grissom, one of the three astronauts who died in the Apollo 1 accident, the actual star so designated is Gamma Cassiopeiae in the center of the constellation.

When SSI began work on the game engine in 1989 after the completion of "The Secret of the Silver Blades", they passed responsibility for continuing the Forgotten Realms Gold Box games to Stormfront. SSI had planned to do only one more Gold Box game ("Gateway to the Savage Frontier") before retiring the series in favor of the Dark Sun engine, but when Dark Sun was delayed and "Gateway" went to #1 on the charts they asked Stormfront for a sequel.
Designers Don Daglow, Mark Buchignani, Mark Manyen and David Bunnett recognized that the Gold Box engine was past its prime and needed some kind of story or character enhancements to feel like a new game and not a tired sequel.
Although they added many small enhancements to the game in addition to its all-new story, the largest feature was the first-ever option for either of two NPCs to fall in love with a player character. The sophisticated AI (for its time) tracked the player's actions in the game, much as the modern game Fable charts the player's actions as good or evil. If the player's actions matched the values of the NPC there was a chance they could fall in love.
Plot overview.
A few weeks after the events of "Gateway to the Savage Frontier", the mage Amelior Aminitas magically summons the party (by now called the "Heroes of Ascore") to eliminate the (apparently) last remaining troops of the Zhentarim from the dwarven city of Llorkh.
Afterwards, the party is given a seemingly simple mission - to protect ambassadors of the "Lord's Alliance," which holds together the different cities of the frontier. However, the ambassadors are kidnapped, the Zhentarim and its allies (the Kraken Society and the Hosttower of the Arcane) plot to break up the alliance to conquer the region, and the party is framed as traitors.
Much of the game is devoted to the players attempting to clear their names (usually done by completing a mission in each town of the Lord's Alliance) and alerting the alliance's leaders of the plot. The final mission (which doesn't necessarily fit in the overall plotline) involves retrieving a treasure held by a dragon.
To uncover the plot, the player has to collect two different sets of items:
Gameplay.
"Treasures of the Savage Frontier" allowed characters up to level 12. Depending on the player character's actions, certain non-player characters could fall in love with him. The game allowed the option to utilize allied forces, which increased the number of combatants.
Reception.
The game was reviewed in 1992 in "Dragon" #184 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.
According to GameSpy, "interest in the Gold Box-style of games waned quickly after its release. For what it's worth, it was a memorable enough closing for the series, and it is remembered as one of the more polished and accomplished of the games".
Trivia.
One interesting side note to the game is the presence of what may be the only absurdist character in a video game, Ougo the Strange. Created by Daglow as a tribute to "Theatre of the Absurd" playwright Eugène Ionesco, Ougo is a bizarre Ionesco-style character in the otherwise normal island of Farr Windward who ends up playing a key role in one of the game's missions.
The game's principal technical enhancement to the aging Gold Box engine was the addition of weather to "wilderness play", with combat encounters in the snow restricting character movement and adding variety to the game.

Incomplete comparison

An incomplete comparison is a misleading argument popular in advertising. For example, an advertiser might say "product X is better". This is an incomplete assertion, so it can't be refuted. A complete assertion, such as "product X sells for a lower price than product Y" or "the new product X lasts longer than the old product X" could be tested and possibly refuted.
In grammar, an incomplete comparison is a comparison that leaves out one of the item being compared.
Unacceptable:
"Learning Chinese is more difficult. difficult than what?"
Acceptable:
"Learning Chinese is more difficult than learning Spanish."

Thrust (Transformers)

Thrust is the name of several fictional characters from the Transformers series. The original character was an evil red Decepticon jet, with most of the following character using the name Thrust being a variation on that concept. The biggest exception being the Thrust who appeared in "Beast Machines" who was an evil Vehicon who turned into a motorcycle.
Transformers: Generation 1.
Thrust in the original Transformers toyline is the name of a Decepticon who transforms into a red VTOL jet.
Thrust, Ramjet, and Dirge are part of a team dubbed by Transformers fans as the "Coneheads" for the way their animation models were drawn to make them visually distinct from the original Decepticon jets Starscream, Skywarp, and Thundercracker despite their toys being modifications of the same mold used to create that original trio. 
Thrust's personality is that of a braggart who tries to psyche out his opponents with the roar of his engines, but is in fact a coward when it comes to actual battle. 
Thrust was named the 24th top unfortunately named Transformer by Topless Robot.
Marvel Comics.
Thrust first appeared in issue #17 of the US Marvel Transformers comic, acting as a bodyguard for Straxus. 
"He played a larger role in the Marvel UK storyline "Target: 2006", where he was portrayed as one of the Decepticons' deadliest killers, and one that needed to be taken out by the Autobot commando group the Wreckers to signal a mass-Autobot uprising on Cybertron. The Decepticons had prepared a major offensive to wipe the Autobots out and capture Emirate Xaaron, unaware this was part of the Autobot trap. Megatron's summoning the Insecticons to Earth scrapped both sides’ plans."
He subsequently joined the Decepticons on Earth. He was seen entering Earth via the Spacebridge, alongside Ramjet and Dirge around the same time as the Aerialbots were being created. Despite acquitting themselves well against the inexperienced Autobots they were eventually forced to flee when the Aerialbots formed Superion. 
"A story called "The Gift" in issue 93 of the Marvel UK comics explored Jetfire's problems fitting in with the other Autobots. Jetfire accompanied Jazz to a Blackrock fuel plant to oversee the creation of more fuel for the Autobots. The plant was attacked by Decepticons Thrust and Bombshell. Although Jetfire was able to put out a fire at the plant before it exploded, he blamed himself for being slow to react. "
Thrust would serve as part of the Earthbound forces under first Shockwave, then Ratbat, battling both the Autobots and Scorponok's Decepticon faction. When Starscream seized the power of the Underbase, Dirge, Thrust and Ramjet were part of the forces sent against him. 
"Although they were not shown to be deactivated by the villain, they were not seen again in the comic continuity, although they would be seen in the UK. Earthforce tales under the command of Megatron and Shockwave. In the alternate Movie themed future of the UK comics, Thrust was indicated to have taken command of the Seekers."
It is unclear if Thrust was revived with many of the other Decepticons deactivated by Starscream's power, but as Dirge and Ramjet were both shown to be alive and well, it is likely.
Animated series.
In the cartoon, Thrust first appeared in the second season episode "Dinobot Island".
In the episode "The God Gambit" Cosmos collected data in space on a potential new power source, but was attacked by Astrotrain, Thrust and Starscream. Crashing on the moon Titan, the local priests worshiped the Decepticons as "Sky Gods", but rebels were able to reactivate Cosmos and call for aid from the Autobots. Optimus Prime sent Omega Supreme with Perceptor and Jazz. Astrotrain set himself up as the chief god of the moon and forced the natives to gather energy crystals. The trip to Titan drained Omega of most of his energy, but Perceptor and Jazz were able to gather enough crystals to reactivate Omega and defeat the three Decepticons. Vowing to not let the Autobots gain the crystals, Astrotrain set up a chain reaction destroying them. The Autobots aided the natives to escape the explosion and helped them settle in another area of the moon.
In "The Golden Lagoon" Thrust is the one that discovers the lagoon after Beachcomber left. He was also one of the nine Transformers to be transported to the giant alien world in "Child's Play". He attempted to warn the Insecticons about the Morphabots in "Quest For Survival," but was simply fired upon. In "Kremzeek!" he was responsible for dropping Kremzeek in the Autobot base.
Thrust also appeared in the . Among other roles he had in the movie, Thrust is most recognized as the first Decepticon run over by Optimus Prime as the Autobot Leader made his way towards Megatron. Thrust, along with Dirge, and Ramjet are crushed by Unicron yet they all appear in later episodes.
In "Ghost in the Machine", Thrust and Dirge are among other Decepticons being punished by Galvatron for failing to stop a demoralizing assault by Starscream—now a ghost possessing the bodies of other Decepticons. Just before he and the other offenders are to be hunted down, Trypticon, the Decepticon city is possessed, trapping Thrust, Dirge, Runamuck and Runabout inside. He and Dirge liberates Trypticon from Starscream's control, just before the traitorous ghost was about to aid Unicron in destroying Cybertron.
Thrust appeared in episode #1 and #15 of the Japanese exclusive "Headmasters" series.
Dreamwave Productions.
Thrust was recruited as a Decepticon under the leadership of Megatron in his war against the Autobots on the planet Cybertron. Thrust became a member of the elite Seekers under Aerospace Commander Starscream. He often worked with fellow Seekers Ramjet and Dirge. He appeared defending Cybertron's planetary engines from Grimlock's group, but was later seen slumped against the wall. Staying with the Decepticons during the chaos following Megatron's disappearance, Thrust was one of those who defeated the Chaos Trinity. 
In the third "War Within" series Thrust appeared among the Decepticon troops under the command of Shockwave.
After the Great Shutdown ended, Thrust was reformatted by Shockwave into the form of an Earth-style jet, serving as one of his bodyguards. After the War between the Autobots and Decepticons ended on Cybertron, Ultra Magnus led a mission to Earth to arrest the Autobots on Earth for continuing their violent ways. Thrust was among the troops under Ultra Magnus. 
Defeated by the Autobots on Cybertron, Shockwave was forced to set up a new secret headquarters in the wastelands of Cybertron, with Astrotrain, Blitzwing, Dirge, Ramjet and Thrust following him. Shockwave completed work on his new warrior, Sixshot. Megatron returned to Cybertron with three clone warriors and the Predacons and was able to defeat Shockwave. Shockwave was kept alive, but restrained. All Shockwave's warriors except Blitzwing, who was destroyed, joined up with Megatron in his plan to invade the Earth.
Devil's Due Publishing.
Thrust would appear again in the second G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers crossover from Devil's Due Publishing with Dirge, Ramjet, Scourge and Cyclonus, acting as bodyguards for Shockwave. When the Dinobots returned from different a time period they routed Shockwave's troops. Ramjet was presumably killed either during this event, or when Cobra Commander detonated a store of explosives inside Starscream, killing everyone present. In this story, Thrust had not received an Earthen mode and transformed into a Cybertronian jet.
Despite this Thrust (or at least a cone-headed jet Decepticon with a similar color scheme) would be seen amongst the Decepticon troops trying to hold back the Autobot/G.I. Joe force attempting to rescue Optimus Prime. Here, like most other Transformers featured, he was in his Earthen form.
Fun Publications.
In "Transformers: Timelines" volume 2 #2, "Games of Deception" (set in the Marvel universe but not following the continuity of either "Generation 2" or the later Marvel UK tales) Thrust appeared under the command of Bugbite. Coming to Earth with him, Thrust served him loyally, hitting Ramjet with a cerebro shell. However, in the final three-way battle between Bugbite's group, Megatron's forces and Ultra Magnus' Autobots, Thrust was gunned down by Magnus.
Thrust appears in "At Fight's End".
IDW Publishing.
Thrust appears among the Cybertronians fighting alongside Megatron in "Megatron Origin" #3, where he is seen fighting Ironhide. 
Thurst appears in "" as part of the Decepticon infiltration cell on Nebulos when Thunderwing arrived. Thrust was ordered to stay in their base in order to be able to have a recording of the events in case things went wrong. Despite the Decepticons' best efforts the monster devastated much of the planet and Thrust fled along with Dreadwind and Darkwing.
In "All Hail Megatron" #16 Thrust was among the Decepticons discovered wounded and hiding in abandoned buildings in New York by the U.S. military.
Beast Wars II.
A second character named Thrust was introduced in the Japanese exclusive series "Beast Wars II".
Animated series.
In the Japanese exclusive "Beast Wars II" series, Thrust is a Predacon who transformers into a yellow jet, and is a soldier in the forces of a transformer calling himself Galvatron. 
Like his best friend Dirge, Thrust has the attitude of a manzai comedian. He never calms down and hates acting serious. He’d much rather have fun and take things in stride. Thrust has a shrewd personality, though, and along with Dirge he forms a well-known duo among the Predacons. Unfortunately, the duo isn’t known for exactly what they’d like to be. For the most part they are thought of as bunglers. Thrust hates sea breezes since they tend to cause him to rust and for that reason alone he strangely has a great hatred of the Maximal Scuba.
Thrust and Dirge share a great deal in common. Thrust transforms into a stealthy fighter jet just like his partner. He also carries his weapon of choice, the Thrust Gun, in his leg compartment and can attach a barrel to it for increased power.
Thrusts inability to focus on anything for a length of time reduces him and his partner to the more menial tasks while complex assignments are left to more appropriate Predacons.
Later, he is upgraded by Gigastorm using the power of the Angolmois energy, thereby transforming him into Thrustor, a cybernetic velociraptor.
Manga.
In "The Maximal Brainwashing Project" Starscream and BB were able to capture Diver and the Tasmanian Kid, brainwashing them into serving the Predacons. Meanwhile Leo Prime, Apache and Scuba were able to capture Dirge and Thrust. The shock of being damaged in capture had the side effect of making the Predacons think they were Maximals. Diver and the Kid were able to ambush the Maximals, allowing Galvatron to gain the upper hand on Lio Convoy, but the Maximals were aided by Dirge and Thrust. Furious that Lio had seemingly stolen his brainwashing idea Starscream had BB attacked the Maximals. Megastorm found the whole turn of events amusing and planned to use his main cannon to destroy all the Maximals and Predacons in the conflict, becoming the leader of the Predacons. His attack took so long to charge Diver was able to ruin it with a water geyser. The explosion was enough to shock the brainwashed Maximals back to their senses. Galvatron and the Predacons retreated with Dirge and Thrust in tow.
IDW Publishing.
In "Beast Wars: The Ascending" Shokaract's heralds Hellscream, Max-B, Antagony, Thrustor and Hardhead defended their master on Cybertron until he was shunted into limbo by the Maximal Snarl. The heralds then retreated once there was no vessel for Unicron.
Thrust had a biography printed in the "Beast Wars Sourcebook" by IDW Publishing.
Transformers: Armada.
In the "Transformers: Armada" cartoon series, Thrust is a noted Decepticon strategist called to Earth by Megatron. He becomes second in command of the Decepticons under Megatron replacing Starscream who had served that role prior to leaving the Decepticons.
Note: According to the Japanese tech spec and animated series Thrust can become invisible, but in the Dreamwave comics, they attribute his ability to turn invisible to his Mini-Con partner Inferno.
Animated series.
Stealthily stalking the skies in his jet mode, Thrust is aided by his optical camouflage powers that render him invisible. He personally selected the Mini-Con Inferno to be his partner when he arrived on Earth from Cybertron. In addition, he worked in conjunction with the Air Military Team (Terradive, Thunderwing, Gunbarrel) on several occasions.
Heralded as a master tactician and general, Thrust won numerous victories for the Decepticons on the planets Duke and Vector. The schemes he crafted for the Decepticons certainly seemed to confirm that fact, but they came crashing down when he failed to factor in the arrival of Jetfire on Earth, and later, his ability to combine with Optimus Prime. 
Following these, and other disastrous encounters with the Autobots, Thrust was approached by Sideways and given promises of great power and respect, Thrust began to work against Megatron. At the same time, he arranged a scheme to manipulate Starscream and eventually allow the Decepticons to gain possession of all three Mini-Con weapons, which Thrust then used to power the mighty Hydra-Cannon. Back on Cybertron, however, Thrust's treachery was revealed when he absconded with the Skyboom Shield and Requiem Blaster, and delivered them to Sideways, who planned to use them to revive his master, the Chaos-Bringer Unicron. Following Starscream's self-sacrifice and Sideways' theft of the Star Saber, Unicron was fully reborn and attacked Cybertron, with Thrust perched on his shoulder cheering over the destruction of the Transformers race. Because of this, both Optimus and Megatron (who is now reformatted as Galvatron) agree to form an alliance between the Autobots and Decepticons to defeat Unicron and save their planet. While Optimus tries to blast an opening on Unicron, Galvatron angrily confronts Thrust on Unicron's surface for his treachery, swearing that he will pay for it. However, Thrust retorts at this, saying that so much damage has been done on Cybertron and that Galvatron would be foolish to have the Decepticons to side up with the Autobots to save it. An angry Galvatron then prepares to fire his cannon on Thrust, who then attempts to fly away, only to bump into a portion of Unicron's body by accident and became lodged in a shifting joint, and found that his cries for help elicited no response from either the Chaos-Bringer or his former leader. Galvatron warned him that this was the fate of those who dared to dream of both power and treason, and walked away as Thrust was crushed to his death, thus being consumed by his desire for ultimate power.
Dreamwave Productions.
Thrust had a much lesser role in the accompanying Dreamwave comics. He first appeared in issue #9, arriving from Cybertron to equip the Decepticons with rocket boosters, providing them with some much needed mobility. He then took part in the Decepticon assault on the Mini-Con base on the moon, and also battled Hot Shot and Red Alert alongside Starscream in order to discover the location of the Autobot base. He then became part of Megatron's forces on Earth, hunting the Mini-Con adventure team, accidentally being taken out by a super-powered Cyclonus and accompanying Starscream and Demolishor in search of Over-Run and the Mini-Con Matrix, battling Hot Shot again. However, they ran into trouble in the most unexpected of forms - the original Galvatron, who took out Thrust. Left for dead by the other two, Thrust managed to make his way to the Decepticon base on Earth. His luck didn't improve: he was confronted by Galvatron's fellow Heralds of Unicron - the original versions of Scourge, Thunderwing and Dirge - and subsequently beaten to a pulp. He did not appear again in the "Armada" comics.
Although the character of Thrust did not appear in the "Energon" animated series he continued to appear in the "Transformers: Energon" comic series by Dreamwave, allying himself with the Autobots after the disappearance of Megatron. He was one of those who aided the Autobots when Cybertron was attacked by the Four Horsemen of Unicron: Airazor, Cheetor, Rhinox and Terrorsaur. Subsequently, he was one of those who volunteered to head to Earth to battle the Terrorcon invasion. He was one of the defenders of Toronto alongside Hot Shot, Red Alert, Hoist, Beachcomber and Rodimus, battling against Divebomb and a swarm of Terrorcon clones before receiving help from a very unlikely source: Megatron, resurrected in a new body by Optimus Prime. Megatron decimated the Terrorcon invasion, and Thrust attempted to ingratiate himself with his bemused former leader. 
Thrust would make one more appearance in flashback in "Transformers: Energon" #30 as one of the Decepticons piloting Megatron’s battle barge as Starscream delivered a warning of Scorponok's ambitions. Unfortunately Dreamwave went out of business at this point, so any further development of Thrust remains untold.
Transformers: Cybertron.
Another Thrust appeared in the "Transformers: Cybertron" line as a Mini-Con.
Thrust was presented as a revolutionary who enjoyed defying the pointless laws of the Mini-Con Council. Thriving on chaos, he took advantage of the black hole created by the Unicron singularity, sabotaging the Mini-Cons' ships and leaving them trapped on Cybertron as the black hole expands, then leading a rebellion.
Fun Publications.
Thrust pays the price for his ways in the club comic. When Unicron attacks Cybertron in the midst of the Mini-Con civil war, Thrust is amongst those killed by the chaos bringer.
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.
Thrust is a cowardly Decepticon jet. He prefers fighting humans to Autobots, but will fly away in terror if they attack with heavy artillery.
Transformers Animated.
Thrust is Swindle's bodyguard. He is a clone of Starscream, representing Starscream's envy.
Fun Publications.
Thrust's sole, brief appearance is in "The AllSpark Almanac II". He bears the dubious distinction of being the only "Animated" Starscream clone to get not only no in-show portrayal but also no toy as well.

Organizations in Deus Ex

"This article is a list of organizations in Deus Ex 1. For a list of organizations in other Deus Ex games, please see and ."
In the cyberpunk computer game Deus Ex, the player encounters a variety of different kinds of organizations. The following is a listed summary of each of the fictional organizations within the world of the futuristic cyberpunk computer game "Deus Ex", which is set in the year 2052.
UNATCO.
The United Nations Anti-terrorist Coalition Organization (UNATCO) is a major antagonist organization in Deus Ex. UNATCO are depicted in Deus Ex as a peacekeeping, anti-terrorist organization established to deal with the growing problem of international terrorism. UNATCO is described as "the world's first ever policemen" UNATCO plays a key role in the storyline of Deus Ex, since they responsible for many evil acts including the dispersal of biological warfare agents against the general population, and military suppression of any peaceful or military resistance to UNATCO member governments. UNATCO's questionable acts are because they are actually a branch of a larger conspiracy, Majestic 12, which is using UNATCO to take over the world.
The game does not specifically mention when UNATCO was formed, however, the player learns that UNATCO has in fact been in existence for many years. For instance, Paul Denton joined UNATCO in 2040. In 2035, Paul Denton is said to have vowed to join UNATCO to fight against terrorism. Mechanical augmented agents, Gunther Hermann and Anna Navarre have also worked for UNATCO for many years, although how long is not made clear in the game. JC Denton confirms that UNATCO itself had existed many years before 2052 (the fictional date where Deus Ex takes place) when he says to Shannon, "...Amazing, if you think about it, all the hours I spent dreaming about working here...". The character, Walton Simons indicates that UNATCO may have been formed by executive order due to an attack on the Statue of Liberty, however, an in-game document reveals that the executive order had to do with the establishment of the UNATCO headquarters on Liberty Island, rather than with establishment of UNATCO itself.
UNATCO are introduced in Deus Ex following a false flag terrorist strike on the Statue of Liberty. At the beginning of the game, the player receives his orders direct from UNATCO director, Joseph Manderley. Manderley reminds the player to always and constantly follow procedure. During the game, the player discovers evidence, suggesting that UNATCO is part of a larger conspiracy known as Majestic 12. JC Denton uncovers financial links, which bind UNATCO to the director of FEMA, Walton Simons and key leader of Majestic-12. The player also learns that Joseph Manderley is but a puppet appointed by Majestic 12 to do their dirty work, including sending the player to assassinate Luminous Path scientist, Tracer Tong. Joseph Manderley was appointed in order to provide an urbane face for UNATCO, but is later assassinated and replaced by Walton Simons in order to "restore discipline". UNATCO are depicted in the game as constantly framing other organizations for various acts, including the bombing of the Statue of Liberty, drug smuggling and murder, which were done to reduce support for the NSF organization and their allies. UNATCO personnel, especially in the case of the player are rarely allowed discretion, even if the action would improve society. Characters, such as Paul and JC Denton, who use discretion are often heavily rebuked, or even expelled from UNATCO.
As a result of the actions of the player, the global communications network called the Aquinas router is overloaded and destroyed. This plunges the world into a dark age. The organization, Majestic 12 and by extension, UNATCO are depicted in the sequel "" as having ceased to exist. The UNATCO headquarters on Liberty Island is an effective ruin occupied by a class of people known as bums. With the exception of the ruined complex towards the end of , UNATCO is rarely mentioned, implying that they disbanded after the events of Deus Ex.
When "Deus Ex" was released in 2000, Ion Storm created a website (www.unatco.org) for the fictional organization to promote the game. Ion Storm pulled the website shortly after the September 11 attacks. The motto of UNATCO is from the "Sententiae" of Publilius Syrus: "Nihil aliud scit necessitas quam vincere", which means, ""Necessity knows nothing else but victory.""
National Secessionist Forces.
The National Secessionist Forces (NSF) is the second major organization to be encountered by the player in Deus Ex. During the early stages of the game, the NSF are depicted as a terrorist organization, who were partially said to be involved in numerous terrorist acts. However, the player later discovers in the game that many of these reported terrorist acts are lies, or they were framed by Majestic 12 for many of the terrorist acts. Many of the terrorist acts had been done by Majestic 12 as a plot to reduce support for the NSF and their allies. The NSF were also framed for many other criminal acts, including illegal drug smuggling (although the Luminous Path Triad, being a mafia group, is involved in such smuggling activities). When the NSF started running out of troops during their assault in New York City, however, they began to desperately take hostages, allowing them to stall for time and delay UNATCO, despite a policy discouraging hostage-taking.
While the United Nations and the U.S. government classified the NSF as a terrorist group, many people saw the NSF as liberators from an increasingly authoritarian U.S. central government. Leon Woods was killed at his infamous last stand in 2045 at Squalnomie Square, but the NSF continued on gaining more and more strength, as well as gaining support from Silhouette (the resistance movement against the French government), the Luminous Path Triad (a mafia group in Hong Kong), and X-51 (a group of former Area 51 scientists). Dissident computer scientists and programmers, said to be based in Seattle and San Francisco, aided the NSF in setting up a highly encrypted communication network, eroding the edge that MJ-12 and UNATCO had due to their control over the Aquinas network and ECHELON. At this point, the United Nations declared war on the NSF. The state of Texas, which unsuccessfully tried to secede in 2032, is described in an email as being in a state of constant warfare between the NSF and UNATCO and the U.S. military. Their resistance to the U.S government makes them dangerous in Majestic 12's sight. Majestic 12 bomb the Statue of Liberty to justify the need to establish a UNATCO headquarters on Liberty Island with the (secret) intent of destroying The NSF to suppress the truth.
The NSF discover that the United Nations and the U.S. government are deliberately restricting the lower-class people from accessing Ambrosia, which is the only known temporary remedy for The Gray Death. The NSF learn that UNATCO is actually under the control of Majestic 12. The NSF fear that Majestic 12 will take over the world, so forcefully intercept an Ambrosia shipment and steal the vaccine in an attempt that government employees and the lower class might be given the same chance as the upper class to survive. The NSF planned to load the Ambrosia onto a 747 where it could be shipped to Luminous Path Triad scientist Tracer Tong to be synthesized, making the NSF popular with the lower classes.
JC Denton is sent by Joseph Manderley on orders of FEMA director Walton Simons to stop the NSF, but subsequently learns of the truth and allies with the NSF. He sends an NSF distress signal from NSF's New York headquarters in Hell's Kitchen, allowing other NSF bases and resistance groups in Europe to take necessary counter measures. Several prominent members from the New York Section remain at large, probably waiting to reform the organization in New York; indeed, this is evidenced by the fleeing of NSF commanders Decker Parkes, Erin Todd, and Wayne Young to Europe. During the game, an NSF brigade is conducting operations in Paris under the command of , leader of Silhouette and the Illuminatus Morgan Everett. Morgan Everett, in conversation with JC, mentions their still-operational HQ as being a few hundred miles north of the X-51 base at Vandenberg. In Paris, JC Denton overhears a man asking his wife to come with him to America as he has been contracted to work with the NSF.
After the events of Deus Ex, most of the organization seems to be crippled but not destroyed. This is partly due to the actions of the player, whose short tenure with UNATCO saw the capture of several important bases, including the NSF New York headquarters, capture or death of several commanders, including a prominent NSF leader and financial backer, Juan Ivanovich Lebedev, and the failure of a critical operation in New York City.
Rooks.
The Rooks are a gang that live in a hidden and abandoned sector of subway in Battery Park, along with civilians unaffiliated to them called the Mole People. They are led by a man named El Rey and hold power that is opposed by few. The only threatening adversary that they have in the subway is a zyme dealer named Rock. Some members of the gang mention that they are considering being hired by the NSF as mercenary contractors. Some may have already taken the offer, as men in the same uniform as Rooks are seen on Liberty Island (called 'mercenary thugs'), and a few are also seen in Hell's Kitchen (called 'NSF thugs').
FEMA.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is based loosely on the real world government organization with the same name. FEMA in both the real world and in Deus Ex is an agency of the US Department of Homeland Security that was created by Presidential Order on 1 April 1979. Like in the real world, FEMA is tasked with handling responses to natural and domestic disasters within the United States, arguably making FEMA among one of the most influential organizations in Deus Ex. In Deus Ex, FEMA is directed by Majestic 12 augmented agent, Walton Simons, who uses his position as FEMA director to take control of the U.S government under the false pretense of "terrorism". For instance, after the Statue of Liberty bombing, FEMA were able to take control of the government and authorize the establishment of the UNATCO Headquarters on Liberty Island.
The transcripts of conversations in Deus Ex reveal that an unnamed Senator is infected with the plague and will be promised Ambrosia to treat the plague, if he appoints Walton Simons the director of FEMA. As a result, Simons is appointed to the position. It is made evident that Majestic 12 were coercing governments and people in powerful positions to obey their wishes should they want Ambrosia for the plague.
FEMA is a tool used by Majestic 12 to implement a New World Order. Throughout Deus Ex, FEMA takes an unusually aggressive stance against terrorism and rioting in cities such as New York.
Majestic 12.
Majestic 12 (also written as MJ-12, MJ12, or Majestic-12) is the major antagonistic organization in the game. Majestic 12 is hinted at near the start of the game and is mentioned towards the midpoint of the game. If the player so chooses, Majestic 12 are seen early in the game while the player is rescuing Ford Schick. Otherwise Majestic 12 are encountered later in the game. J.C Denton may first learn of Majestic 12 from his own brother, Paul Denton. Later while assisting Paul Denton, JC Denton is captured and held in a secret facility. He soon discovers that this facility is in fact a Majestic 12 facility located beneath UNATCO Headquarters, establishing a definite connection between the two organizations.
Majestic 12 plans to control the world in secret through the production of the "Gray Death nanovirus" and the virus's vaccine, Ambrosia. The organization's public fronts include Page Industries, which controls the global banking system and is run by Bob Page, VersaLife (a division of Page Industries), and UNATCO.
It is later revealed to the player that Majestic 12 are actually The Majestic Council of The Twelve. It was originally under the control of The Illuminati, however, a wealthy and powerful banker Bob Page neutralised the ruling Council of Five and seized Majestic 12 from their control.
Majestic 12 also controls and selectively censiors all global communications using the Aquinas Protocol and other complex information-processing systems. Daedalus was an artificial intelligence originally intended as a pattern-matching AI to assist in finding and processing of information, however, Bob Page wanted to use it as a "weapon" to control electronics. This new use of Daedalus led to unpredictable events. Daedalus using its pattern matching algorithm identified Majestic 12 as a terrorist group along with Silhouette and The NSF. As a result, Daedalus assisted JC Denton escape from the Majestic 12 facility.
Majestic 12 also use sophisticated military technologies or advanced surveillance techniques to monitor and study people's psychological behaviour. These patterns are then used to play mind games on the masses, for example, by creating an illusion of a false enemy i.e. UNATCO vs NSF. In many cases, Majestic 12's enemies are weakened allowing them to gain more power. Majestic 12 also use Men in Black to intimidate or unnerve dissidents and coerce them in to submission, and to deter would-be assassins or spies when serving as bodyguards and security forces.
Majestic 12's main HQ is based in Area 51, but has bases including but not limited to submerged Ocean Labs, concealed bases in UNATCO headquarters, bases in the sewage system beneath New York, and the Versalife Headquarters.
Majestic 12 military personnel bear the insignia "XII", which is twelve in Roman numerals. Other symbols used include a hand menacing a globe; this is displayed in actual form in Majestic Twelve's facilities, including the restricted labs at VersaLife's Hong Kong building, as a kind of centrepoint. The symbol also appears on MJ-12 computer terminals, in this instance the globe being the azimuthal equidistant projection used by the UN flag, under the shadow of a translucent hand. The symbol can therefore be interpreted in either of two ways; as a display of MJ-12's actual covert control of the UN and associated agencies, such as UNATCO, or as an aspiration to the complete world domination that the group strives towards and very nearly acquires.
Page Industries.
Page Industries is a huge multinational corporation owned by antagonist Bob Page. Page Industries owns VersaLife and is involved in robotics manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, construction, computer hardware, software manufacturing, and defence. It is mentioned frequently throughout the game, but appears to be a front for Majestic 12. Page Industries was partially responsible for the augmentation project, including the creation of JC and Paul Denton. Page Industries is not mentioned in "", implying that the organization probably ceased to exist.
VersaLife.
VersaLife is seen in the game as a multinational company owned by Page Industries. The player infiltrates the VersaLife data entry facility, located in Hong Kong on orders of Tracer Tong. There, the player meets the shift supervisor, Richard Hundley, who can be persuaded to give access to the labs. After the player accesses the labs, he discovers that VersaLife in fact specialise in nanotechnology, nanoaugmentations and genetic engineering. The player's character, JC Denton comments that, "They're hiding more than nanotechnology down there" and would later discover that VersaLife themselves is under the control of Majestic 12 and were responsible for (intentionally) creating The Grey Death virus using a universal constructor. The player notices throughout the game that VersaLife also conduct unethical experiments in secret labs which are strictly off limits under the false pretense of "trade secrets". It is revealed that VersaLife also experiment with synthetic creatures, known as "transgenics,". Some of these include Greasels, Grays, and Karkians. In addition to these creatures, Bob Page claims that VersaLife created the protagonist, JC Denton, and his brother, Paul Denton. This is later proved by four cloning tubes in Area 51 that are labeled for JC, Paul, a clone of Walton Simons named Wade Walker, and . Alex Denton appears in the sequal to Deus Ex, .
The Illuminati.
The player is directed to Morgan Everett in an attempt to find a cure for The Gray Death. JC Denton learns that Morgan Everett is in fact the leader of The Illuminati. The Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus, "enlightened") aim to achieve global domination, so that they can provide a balanced world in which they can rule and control in peace. The Illuminati have been operating in secret for centuries in order to fulfill this goal. Between 1940 and 1965, The Illuminati contained a database of all the genetic codes of all the population. Notable leaders include Morgan Everett, Stanton Dowd, Lucius DeBeers, Chad Dumier, and Nicolette DuClare.
The plan of The Illuminati was to bring the world to a state where it relied on The Illuminati, allowing a centralised government to be created. Therefore, most events in history have been intentionally caused or engineered by The Illuminati. The Illuminati planned to control the world through religion and politics, but it became evident that in the 20th century, such beliefs would be rejected by many. Therefore, The Illuminati planned to control the world through controlling finance and technology. The Bilderberg Group and Majestic 12 were formed in order to achieve this goal.
The Illuminati lost power as a result of Majestic 12 separating from the control of The Illuminati. The Illuminati essentially lost most its power in the 21st century and Page attempted to achieve world control by using The Aquinas Protocol.
Silhouette.
Silhouette is the resistance movement against the French government, led by Chad Dumier (who is known to the public as "The Minister of True Lies"). They have discovered that the United Nations and the French government are deliberately restricting poor people from accessing Ambrosia (the vaccine for the Gray Death disease), and are under the control of a secret organization called "Majestic 12" that wants absolute control over everything in the world. They are allied with the NSF (the resistance movement against the United States government), the Luminous Path Triad (a mafia group in Hong Kong), and X-51 (a group of former Area 51 scientists). They focus their efforts on subversion of media outlets to attract citizens to their cause. Their motto is "Tandis qu'ils dorment, nous gagnerons" ("While they sleep, we will win"). The philosophy and approach of Silhouette are similar to the real-life French Situationists. By the game year (2052), Silhouette suffered a leak that led to the exposure of one source of their funding, the wealthy French heiress and banker Beth DuClare. After a brief but torrid scandal, she was assassinated by Majestic 12.
Also during that year, an attack on the Statue of Liberty was the most-cited reason for the establishment of a standing UNATCO force on American soil. Many throughout the world suspected Silhouette, which had several months before released statements on world cultural monuments, among them a claim that the Statue ought not have been given to America. However, it is discovered that UNATCO had perpetrated the bombings to reduce support for Silhouette and its allies.
Through their leader's close relationship with Nicolette DuClare, Silhouette benefit from the financial, social, and intelligence support of the French faction of the Illuminati. Dumier claims that he doubts the Illuminati would continue to assist Silhouette were MJ-12 not a threat, but the younger DuClare sympathizes more with Silhouette. The Illuminati find Silhouette to be useful allies in their struggle with MJ-12.
Knights Templar.
The Knights Templars play only a small role in Deus Ex. They are briefly mentioned only in documents as descendants of the medieval order of the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon. The player does not interact with anyone from The Knights Templars. This is probably due to the fact that they were mostly destroyed by a combined UNATCO/Interpol operation led by Joseph Manderley.
X-51.
As described in game, X-51 is a group of scientists, technicians, and ex-United States army soldiers, led by Dr. Gary Savage, who defected from Area 51 in 2051 after learning about the shadowy intentions of Majestic 12, the secret organization led by the game's main antagonist, Bob Page.
When they walked out, they stole “everything smaller than a paper clip” according to X-51 member and scientist Carla Brown, and C-4'ed the large pieces of machinery at Area 51 that would make up the Universal Constructor needed for MJ-12's nefarious plans.
After their defection, they are said to have eluded UNATCO and the United States Army by posing as a research consortium and purchased Vandenberg Air Force Base, which had fallen into disrepair as a result of a catastrophic seismic upheaval mentioned in the game's back-story only as the "SoCal Earthquake". They have had contact with the NSF, the Illuminati, and other resistance movements, however they are not coordinating fully with any organization. Despite this, they are portrayed as well armed and their Vandenberg base as heavily fortified.
They are the only institution excluding MJ-12 who are said to possess a "Universal Constructor", a device with which they hope to find a cure for the plague known as the "Gray Death", a pandemic that has spread across the planet within the game.

Twelve Years' Truce

The Twelve Years' Truce was the name given to the cessation of hostilities between the Habsburg rulers of Spain and the Southern Netherlands and the Dutch Republic as agreed in Antwerp on 9 April 1609. It was a watershed in the Eighty Years' War, marking the point from which the independence of the United Provinces received formal recognition by outside powers. For the time of its duration, the Truce allowed King Philip III and his favorite minister the Duke of Lerma to disengage from the conflict in the Low Countries and devote their energies to the internal problems of the Spanish Monarchy. The Archdukes Albert and Isabella used the years of the Truce to consolidate Habsburg rule and to implement the Counter-Reformation in the territories under their sovereignty.
Context.
The war in the Low Countries reached a stalemate in the 1590s. After the fall of Antwerp in 1585, King Philip II ordered Alexander Farnese to direct his military actions first towards the failed campaign of the Spanish Armada, then against France to prevent the succession of King Henry IV. In the following years the Army of Flanders was entirely on the defensive. Unable to sustain the cost of a war on three fronts, Philip II was forced to declare a suspension of payments in 1596. Spain's predicament was adroitly used by Stadtholder Maurice. In a series of campaigns, the Republic's army surprised Breda in 1590, took Deventer, Hulst and Nijmegen the following year and captured Groningen in 1594. By that stage the Army of Flanders had lost almost all its strategic positions north of the great rivers.
After the accession of Philip III in Spain and of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella in the Habsburg Netherlands in 1598, the Army of Flanders tried to regain the offensive against the Dutch Republic. While it met with a tactical defeat in the Battle of Nieuwpoort on 2 July 1600, it did succeed in its strategic goal to repel the Dutch invasion of Flanders. The lengthy Siege of Ostend (1601-1604) amply demonstrated the balance of power. Both sides poured enormous resources into the besieging or defending a town that was reduced to rubble. Ambrogio Spinola, who had succeeded Archduke Albert as commander in the field, eventually captured the town on 22 September 1604, but only at the price of accepting the loss of Sluis. The following year, Spinola seized the initiative, bringing the war north of the great rivers for the first time since 1594. Suddenly the Dutch Republic had the enemy threatening its heartland. By 1606, the Spanish army had captured Oldenzaal, Lochem, Lingen, Rijnberk and Groenlo despite the efforts of Maurice of Nassau. 
Meanwhile, Habsburg diplomacy had managed to disengage from two fronts. In 1598 Henry IV and Philip II had ended the Franco-Spanish War with the Peace of Vervins. Six years later, James I, Philip III and the Archdukes concluded the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) with the Treaty of London. Together, these treatises allowed the Habsburgs to concentrate their resources on the war against the Dutch. They did not however keep the Republic's allies from continuing their material support. Moreover, Habsburg successes in the Low Countries came at a heavy price. In 1605 the Dutch East India Company made serious inroads into the Portuguese spice trade, by setting up bases in the Moluccas. These advances signaled a serious threat that the conflict might spread further in the Spanish overseas empire. The scale of Spinola's campaigns had furthermore exhausted the Spanish treasury. On 9 November 1607 Philip III announced a suspension of payments. The balance of power had led to a balance of exhaustion. After decades of war, both sides were finally prepared to open negotiations.
Conferences.
On 12 April 1607 the United Provinces and the Habsburg Netherlands agreed to a ceasefire, valid for eight months and taking effect on 4 May. The ceasefire was later extended to include operations at sea. Even then it was difficult to obtain the assent of Philip III. The king was appalled by Albert's readiness to concede on the point of independence. Only the desperate situation of Spain's finances compelled him to ratify the agreement. The ceasefire would be prolonged several times to allow for the negotiations that would eventually lead to the signing of the Twelve Years' Truce.
The peace conference opened in The Hague on 7 February 1608. The negotiations took place in the Binnenhof, in a room that has since been known as the "Trêveszaal". As Stadtholder Maurits declined to take part in the conference, the leadership of the delegation of the Republic was given to his cousin William Louis of Nassau, the Stadtholder of Friesland, Groningen and Drenthe. The chief negotiator on the Dutch side was the influential Land's Advocate of Holland, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. The delegation of the Habsburg Netherlands was led by Ambrogio Spinola. Its leading participant was the Chief-President Jean Richardot. They were assisted by Neyen, the Secretary of State and War, Don Juan de Mancicidor, and the "Audiencier" Louis Verreycken. There was no separate delegation for the King of Spain. The delegates of the Archdukes were empowered to negotiate on his behalf.
The conference failed to come to an agreement on the terms of a peace treaty and it broke up on 25 August. The parties were unable to compromise in matters of colonial trade and religion. To safeguard the Spanish Empire, the Habsburgs demanded that the Dutch would cease all navigation south of the Equator. It was a price that the mercantile United Provinces refused to pay. The demand inspired Hugo Grotius to publish his famous "Mare Liberum" in defense of the Dutch refusal. The United Provinces likewise rejected the Habsburg demand that the Catholics in the Republic would be given freedom of religion as an interference in their domestic affairs. In spite of these setbacks, the French and English mediators nevertheless succeeded to convince the two sides to settle for a lengthy truce. It would preserve the peace, while remaining silent on all contentious subjects. After considering longer and shorter periods, the term of the Truce was set for twelve years.
Formal talks were resumed on 28 March 1609 at the Antwerp City Hall. On 9 April the two delegations set their signatures to the text. The ratification process proved difficult. In the Republic, towns such as Amsterdam and Delft feared that the Truce would diminish their trade. The States of Zeeland resented the loss of income from privateering and insisted on maintaining the blockade of the Scheldt. Philip III had his own reasons to relent. It took several missions from the Archducal Court before he was prepared to ratify the treaty on 7 July 1609.
Content.
The Habsburgs agreed to treat the United Provinces like an independent state for the duration of the Truce. The wording of the article was ambiguous. The Dutch version of the agreement stated more or less that the independence of the Republic had been recognized. The French text suggested that the Republic would be treated "as if" it were independent.
All hostilities would cease for twelve years. The two parties would exercise their sovereignty in the territories that they controlled on the date on the agreement. Their armies would no longer levy contributions in enemy territory, all hostages would be set free. Privateering would be stopped, with both parties repressing acts of piracy against the other. Trade would resume between the former belligerents. Dutch tradesmen or mariners would be given the same protection in Spain and the Archducal Netherlands as enjoyed by Englishmen under the Treaty of London. This meant that they could not be prosecuted for their beliefs, unless they gave offense to the local population. For their part, the Dutch agreed to end the blockade of the Flemish coast, but refused to allow free navigation on the Scheldt.
Exiles from the Southern Netherlands were allowed to return, but would have to conform to Catholicism. Estates that had been seized during the war would be restituted or their value would be compensated. A number of aristocratic families stood to gain from this article, with Stadtholder Maurits and his siblings foremost among them. The practicalities of the restitution were agreed upon in a separate treaty dated 7 January 1610.
The agreement was silent on the trade with the Indies. It did not endorse the Spanish claim to exclusive rights of navigation, nor did it back the Dutch thesis that it could trade or settle wherever there was no previous occupation by either the Spanish or the Portuguese. The Truce did not alleviate the situation of Catholics in the Republic or of Protestants in the Habsburg Netherlands. Although they were not actively persecuted, they could not profess their religion in public and remained excluded from public office.
Consequences.
Developments in the Dutch Republic.
During the Truce, two factions emerged in the Dutch Republic. The divisions separating them were religious as well as political. The unity of the Dutch Reformed Church was threatened by a controversy that found its origins in the opposing views of Jacobus Arminius and Franciscus Gomarus on predestination. Arminius' less rigid views appealed to the well-to-do merchants of Holland. They were also popular among the regents dominating the political life of that province, because they offered the prospect of an inclusive church controlled by the state. Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius were among the principal supporters. The strict interpretations of Gomarus stood for a church of the elect, independent of outside control. They appealed to the industrious strata of the manufacturing towns as well as to exiles from the Southern Netherlands who were excluded from political power, adding an element of social conflict to the controversy. In many towns congregations split between Remonstrants seeking to moderate the Belgic Confession, and Counter-Remonstrants insisting on its rigid interpretation. On 23 September 1617 Stadtholder Maurits openly sided with the Counter-Remonstrants. In an attempt to force the issue, Remonstrants used their sway over local authorities to organize militias. Maurits had them disbanded and ousted Remonstrant regents from one town council after the other. On 29 August 1618 he had Oldenbarnevelt and other leaders of the Remonstrants arrested. Oldenbarnevelt and three others were tried and executed. Others, such as Grotius, were imprisoned in Castle Loevestein. Meanwhile the Synod of Dort upheld the strict interpretation of predestination and declared Arminianism heretical. Arminian theologians such as Johannes Wtenbogaert went into exile, where they set up a separate Remonstrant Church.
Developments in the Archducal Netherlands.
The Archducal Netherlands benefited from the Truce. Agriculture was at last allowed to recover from the devastation of war. The archducal regime encouraged the reclaiming of land that had been inundated in the course of the hostilities and sponsored the impoldering of the Moeren, a marshy area that is presently astride the Belgian–French border. The recovery of agriculture led in turn to a modest increase of the population after decades of demographic losses. Repairing the damage to churches and other buildings helped to boost demand. Industry and in particular the luxury trades likewise underwent a recovery. Other sectors, such as textiles and breweries, benefited from relatively lower wages in comparison to the Dutch Republic. International trade was however hampered by the closure of the river Scheldt. The archducal regime had plans to bypass the blockade with a system of canals linking Ostend via Bruges to the Scheldt in Ghent and joining the Meuse to the Rhine between Venlo and Rheinberg. In order to combat urban poverty, the government supported the creation of a network of Monti di Pietà based on the Italian model.
Meanwhile the archducal regime ensured the triumph of the Counter Reformation in the Habsburg Netherlands. Most Protestants had by that stage left the Southern Netherlands. Under the terms of legislation passed shortly after the Truce, the remaining Protestant presence was tolerated, provided they did not worship in public. Engaging in religious debates was also forbidden by law. The resolutions of the Third Provincial Council of Mechelen of 1607 were likewise given official sanction. Through such measures and by the appointment of a generation of able and committed bishops, Albert and Isabella laid the foundation of the Catholic confessionalisation of the population.
Resumption of hostilities.
More than once it looked as if the Truce was about to collapse. The succession crisis over the duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg resulted in severe tensions during the siege of Jülich of 1610 and the confrontations that led to the Treaty of Xanten in 1614.
Petrus Peckius the Younger led a failed attempt at renewing the truce in 1621.

Woods Point, Victoria

Woods Point is a small town in Victoria, Australia. At the 2006 census, Woods Point and the surrounding area had a population of 94.
The town began as a general store built by Henry Wood, to service the gold diggings around the recently discovered Morning Star Reef. Wood's Point Post Office opened on 1 December 1862.
By 1864, only three years after the discovery of the gold reef, the area had become a thriving town with 36 hotels. The town was subdivided into numerous suburbs, such as Waverly, Piccadilly, Killarney, Richmond, and Morning Star Hill. Communication was established via a telegraph line to Jamieson, and two local papers were in circulation. 
From the 1870s to 1890s, mining activity declined, and the population dropped to between 100 and 200. The mining industry was revived in the 1890s, and the population grew once again, with four hotels servicing the town. Much of the town had to be rebuilt following devastating bushfires in 1939. The Morning Star Mine continued operations until its closure in 1963. 
The town now serves as a hub for recreational trail-bike and off-road four-wheel drive activities and contains one hotel and one general store/petrol station, Mini Golf course, tennis court and many camping areas, the most popular being J. H. Scott Reserve. There are three gold mines still active in the area surrounding the town. The town is still only accessible by dirt roads.
Woods Point was again severely threatened by bushfire in December 2006 and a 2008 bushfire calendar has been released with proceeds going to the town.
The general store in Woods Point closed its doors in late 2010 and a smaller version opened down the main street, just over the bridge. This store facilitates small diesel fuel sales while the Commercial Hotel is covering the unleaded fuel sales. Plenty of fuel for motorbikes.
Morning Star, a publicly listed company, is currently operating the Morning Star mine, as well as other nearby projects.

<doc id="2859527" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2859527" title="Pulsus paradoxus">
Pulsus paradoxus

Pulsus paradoxus (PP), also paradoxic pulse or paradoxical pulse, is an abnormally large decrease in systolic blood pressure and pulse wave amplitude during inspiration. The normal fall in pressure is less than 10 mmHg or 10 torr. When the drop is more than 10mm Hg, it is referred to as pulsus paradoxus. Pulsus paradoxus has nothing to do with pulse rate or heart rate. The normal variation of blood pressure during breathing/respiration is a decline in blood pressure during inhalation and an increase during exhalation. Pulsus paradoxus is a sign that is indicative of several conditions, including cardiac tamponade, pericarditis, chronic sleep apnea, croup, and obstructive lung disease (e.g. asthma, COPD).
The "paradox" in "pulsus paradoxus" is that, on clinical examination, one can detect beats on cardiac auscultation during inspiration that cannot be palpated at the radial pulse. It results from an accentuated decrease of the blood pressure, which leads to the (radial) pulse not being palpable and may be accompanied by an increase in the jugular venous pressure height (Kussmaul's sign). As is usual with inspiration, the heart rate is slightly increased, due to decreased left ventricular output.
Mechanism of reduced blood pressure during inspiration in normal conditions and in tamponade.
Normally during inspiration, systolic blood pressure decreases ≤10 mmHg., and pulse rate goes up slightly. This is because inspiration makes intrathoracic pressure more negative relative to atmospheric pressure. The negative pressure in the thorax increases venous return, so more blood flows into the right side of the heart. However, the decrease in intrathoracic pressure also expands the compliant pulmonary vasculature. This increase in pulmonary blood capacity pools the blood in the lungs, and decreases pulmonary venous return, so flow is reduced to the left side of the heart. Also the increased systemic venous return to the right side of the heart expands the right heart and directly compromises filling of the left side of the heart. Reduced left-heart filling leads to a reduced stroke volume which manifests as a decrease in systolic blood pressure. The decrease in systolic blood pressure leads to a faster heart rate due to the baroreceptor reflex, which stimulates sympathetic outflow to the heart.
Although it might be tempting to expect during inspiration that the increased volume of the right ventricle causes the septum to bulge dramatically into the left ventricle, this is unlikely, as there is still a large pressure gradient between the right and left ventricles during inspiration. However, during cardiac tamponade, this is the case. Here, pressure equalizes between all of the chambers of the heart. This means that there is a zero-sum gain and as the right ventricle gets more volume, it can push the septum into the left ventricle and therefore reduce the volume of the left ventricle. This additional loss of volume of the left ventricle that "only" occurs with equalization of the pressures (as in tamponade) allows for the further reduction in volume, so cardiac output is reduced, leading to a further decline in BP. However, in situations where the left ventricular pressure remains higher than the pericardial sac (most frequently from coexisting disease with an elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure), there is no pulsus paradoxus.
Although one or both of these mechanisms may occur, a third may additionally contribute. The large negative intrathoracic pressure increases the pressure across the wall of the left ventricle (increased transmural pressure, equivalent to within ventricle - outside of ventricle). This pressure gradient, resisting the contraction of the left ventricle, causes an increase in afterload. This results in a decrease in stroke volume, contributing to the decreased pulse pressure and increased heart rate as described above.
Pulsus paradoxus occurs not only with severe cardiac tamponade, but also with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea and croup. The mechanism, at least with severe tamponade, is likely very similar to those of hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies (diastolic dysfunction), where a decrease in Left Ventricular (LV) filling corresponds to an increasingly reduced stroke volume. In other words, with these cardiomyopathies, as LV filling decreases, ejection fraction decreases directly, yet non-linearly and with a negative concavity (negative first and second derivatives). Similarly with tamponade, the degree of diastolic dysfunction is inversely proportional to the LV end-diastolic volume. So during inspiration, since LV filling is lesser relative to that during expiration, the diastolic dysfunction is also proportionally greater, so the systolic pressure drops >10 mm Hg. This mechanism is also likely with pericarditis, where diastolic function is chastened.
Measurement of PP.
PP is quantified using a blood pressure cuff and stethoscope (Korotkoff sounds), by measuring the variation of the systolic pressure during expiration and inspiration. Inflate cuff until no sounds (as is normally done when taking a BP) slowly decrease cuff pressure until systolic sounds are first heard during "expiration" but not during inspiration, (note this reading), slowly continue decreasing the cuff pressure until sounds are heard "throughout" the respiratory cycle, (inspiration and expiration)(note this second reading). If the pressure difference between the two readings is >10mmHg, it can be classified as pulsus paradoxus.
Predictive value for tamponade.
PP has been shown to be predictive of the severity of cardiac tamponade.
Causes.
Pulsus paradoxus can be caused by several physiologic mechanisms. Anatomically, these can be grouped into:
Considered physiologically, PP is caused by:

Television Without Pity

Television Without Pity (often abbreviated TWoP) was a website that provided detailed recaps of select television dramas, situation comedies and reality TV shows, originally by mocking them. In 2007 the site was purchased by the Bravo unit of NBCUniversal. The site began by recapping the television show "Dawson's Creek" and was originally called Dawson's Wrap; later it broadened its scope and changed names to Mighty Big TV before settling on the current moniker. The site is notable for its wide usage of the word "snark" to describe its typical style of sarcastic review. Their official motto is "Spare the snark, spoil the networks," a takeoff on "spare the rod, spoil the child."
On March 27, 2014, it was announced that operations would cease on April 4, 2014, with forums remaining open until May 31, 2014. It was later confirmed, however, that the site's already published content would remain available as an archive, but the forums are no longer available as of May 31.
The site's mascot is Tubeelzebub (a portmanteau of tube and Beelzebub – "Tubey" for short), a devilish television set with horns and a pointed tail.
The recaps and forums have their own jargon, detailed in the site's help section. Recappers also commonly coin nicknames for show characters, based on inside jokes or an actor's previous work. Some of these terms arise from episode-specific forum discussions among non-staff television viewers and make their way into common usage (and sometimes into the recaps as well).
Show recaps and forums.
Recaps differ in styles: some of the recappers write shorter, more concise recaps while others write more comically, inserting references to their personal life, for example. Naturally, each style attracts different readers, with some preferring to use the site as information for episodes that they have missed, and others preferring the more humorous ones, which can be equally (or more) enjoyable to those who also watched the episode. Beginning in 2007, TWoP introduced "weecaps" – initially presented as single-page television series reviews written in real time. The abbreviated recap style – first used for coverage of "The Real World/Road Rules Challenge" and "Dancing with the Stars" during the spring – was later employed for a larger slate of summer replacement series, with eventual reconfiguring into multi-page entries. Shows with weecaps also gain dedicated forums with topic areas as with regularly recapped shows. The American version of "Survivor" used weecap coverage for the start of its but full recaps returned with that edition's 7th episode and have remained in place since then.
Shows canceled by the network (or deemed to be unpopular with the readers of TWoP) are considered to be in "permanent hiatus", a status which is rarely reversed except for reality shows: the U.S. version of "Big Brother" returned to coverage in June 2006 when its All-Stars season began for the first time since its third season; "Real World/Road Rules Challenge" also returned to the active list in April 2007, with its recapping format switched to a shorter, real-time commentary; and while the site decided after the sixth edition of "The Apprentice" to stop recaps, the "Celebrity Apprentice" edition was brought back for coverage. Shows placed into permanent hiatus will generally have their forum threads readable but locked, and given a single dedicated thread in the appropriate miscellaneous forum categories; the recaps remain available on the site, though in the "Permanent hiatus" section. There are some exceptions; "Doctor Who" coverage was put into permanent hiatus after the 2nd season; Glark commented on the action of moving the show to permanent hiatus that "If you want to know what Bit Torrent is, ask a Doctor Who fan". The full "Doctor Who" threaded forum was retained though moved into the Sci-Fi show category, and remains fully active with moderation. As of now, the 2005 remake of "" holds the record for the shortest run on TWoP, having been put on Permanent Hiatus after only one recap, although the 2005 series "Sex, Love & Secrets" was expunged before even one recap, due to incredibly low viewer response in the forums. The shows covered are almost exclusively American, with the exceptions of the new series of "Doctor Who", which is a British import to US television, and the original UK version of "Queer as Folk", which was a British import to Canadian television. Both shows are Russell T Davies productions.
At times, the site may offer a charity auction for "Tubey's Kids", whereby the person with the largest donation can request a recap of a specific episode or show (no longer than one hour) by any specific recapper. The results of these recaps are posted as "Mondo Extras" on the site.
The forum for each active show include threads for each episode of a show, a speculation thread, spoiler information, media references to the show, character/contestant-specific threads, and a general "meet market" for forum users. The forums are heavily moderated by staff to avoid significant off-topic discussion, unprotected spoiler information, and flame wars.
Famous visitors.
Some actors and producers have been known to visit the website. "The West Wing" creator Aaron Sorkin posted in the forums, but his relationship with the site eventually turned sour. His experience is believed to have inspired the episode "The U.S. Poet Laureate". In this episode, a character posts on White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Lyman's fansite and is vehemently attacked by members of the forum for his beliefs and his violation of the forum rules. In contrast, "Veronica Mars" creator Rob Thomas has more fully embraced the TWoP message board community, with a discussion thread in his show's forum open to directly communicate with viewers. In addition, on the January 18, 2007 episode of "My Name Is Earl," a character using the screen name WhoJackie was shown typing a post on the site's forums. As it turns out, a user by that same name had written the same post several days before the episode first aired. Jack Coleman, star of "Heroes" also maintained a blog at the site for some time.
For the past several years, posters at the site have organized "TARCon" in New York City which is a viewing party for the season finale of the "Amazing Race". The party has been attended by many of the show's contestants from current and past seasons.
2008 Staff changes and redesign.
In a March 6, 2008, blog post, TWoP founders Wing Chun (Tara Ariano), Sars (Sarah D. Bunting), and Glark (David T. Cole), announced they were leaving the site on March 11, 2008.
In April 2008, the TWoP site was redesigned and expanded to include features such as a wiki, videos, and a subsection "Movies without Pity."
Recappers.
TWoP's writers and the shows they reviewed at the time they closed the site:
Criticism.
Television Without Pity had a history of being the target of criticism. The site moderators were accused of arbitrarily and unprofessionally applying the discussion forum rules and jumping too quickly to edit posts, and sanction and ban members who did not adhere to the many rules for posting on the site. Moderators were also criticized for engaging in apparently retaliatory behavior, sanctioning or banning members who offered negative feedback or questioned the moderators' actions. Some of this criticism claimed that the problematic moderating increased after the site was acquired by Bravo in 2008, whereas others cite the decline in writing ability of the top moderators / editors. Critics also charged that the site lost its "edge" after the Bravo acquisition.

Great Sioux Reservation

The Great Sioux Reservation was the original area encompassing what are today the various Indian reservations in South Dakota and Nebraska. 
The reservation was established in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, and includes all of modern western South Dakota (commonly known as "West River" South Dakota) and modern Boyd County, Nebraska. This area was established by the United States as a reservation for the Teton Sioux, also known as the Lakota: the seven western bands of the "Seven Council Fires" (the Great Sioux Nation).
Reservation.
In addition to the reservation dedicated to the Lakota, the Sioux reserved the right to hunt and travel in "unceded" territory in much of Wyoming and in the Sandhills and Panhandle of modern Nebraska. Because each band had its territory, the US established a series of agencies through the Bureau of Indian Affairs to regulate the Lakota in this vast area. 
The United States used the Missouri River to form the eastern boundary of the Reservation, but some of the land within this area had already assigned to other tribes, such as the Ponca. The Lakota Nation considered West River central to their territory, as it had been since their discovery of the "Paha Sapa" (Black Hills) in 1765, and their domination of the area after they conquered and pushed out the Cheyenne in 1776.
Custer's 1874 Black Hills Expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln (near Bismarck, Dakota Territory) to the Black Hills or "Paha Sapa" discovered gold. The public announcement brought miners and open conflict with the Lakota. The US Army defeated the Lakota in the Black Hills War. By a new treaty of 1877, the US took a strip of land along the western border of Dakota Territory wide, plus all land west of the Cheyenne and Belle Fourche Rivers, including all of the Black Hills in modern South Dakota. However, the bulk of the Great Sioux Reservation remained intact for another 13 years.
General Allotment Act.
In 1887, Congress passed the General Allotment Act, also called the Dawes Act to break up communal Indian lands into individual family holdings. On 2 March 1889, Congress passed another act (just months before North Dakota and South Dakota were admitted to the Union on 2 November 1889), which partitioned the Great Sioux Reservation, creating five smaller reservations:
(Neither the Crow Creek Reservation, east of the Missouri River in central South Dakota, nor the Fort Berthold Reservation, which straddles the Missouri River in western North Dakota, were part of the original Great Sioux Reservation, although many historians assume one or both were.) With the boundaries of these five reservations established, approximately 9 million acres (36,000 km²), one-half of the former Great Sioux Reservation, was opened by the US government for public purchase for ranching and homesteading. Much of the area was not homesteaded until the 1910s, after the Enlarged Homestead Act increased allocations to for "semi-arid land". 
Settlement was encouraged by the railroads, and the US government issued publications of scientific instruction (since found to be incorrect) on how to farm the land. New European immigrants came to the area. The Lakota tribes received $1.25 per acre, usually used to offset agency expenses in meeting federal treaty obligations to the tribes.
Dawes Allotment Act.
By the Dawes Allotment Act, a listing of tribal members was made prior to allocation of land to individual households. (The Dawes Rolls became the basis of some tribe's qualifications for membership.) The government allocated 320 acre (1.3 km²) parcels to heads of families, and declared any remaining land as "surplus". The allotment of individual parcels and other measures reduced the total land in Indian ownership, while the government tried to force the people to convert to the lifestyles of farmers and craftsmen. The allocations were not based on accurate knowledge of whether the arid lands were sustainable for the family farms which the government envisioned, and experience has shown that to be an unsuccessful experiment for the Lakota and most homesteaders alike. Self-styled experts recommended regular tilling of the soil to attract moisture from the sky. 
It turned out that the Plains were settled during a wetter than normal period. Combined with inappropriate farming techniques and more normal droughts, farmers created the Dust Bowl conditions of the 1930s and many had to abandon their land. The government sold land it declared "surplus" to non-Natives for homesteading. Some individual Lakota owners sold their allocations of land as well.
By the 1960s, the territories of the five reservations were melting away, both through sales under the allocation process and through the US seizure of land for water-control projects, such as construction of Lake Oahe and other mainstem reservoirs on the Missouri River as part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. The Rosebud Reservation, which once included all of four counties and part of another, had been reduced to a single county: Todd County in south-central South Dakota, although much Indian-owned land remained in the other counties. Similar reductions occurred in the other reservations.
Although many non-Native homesteads were abandoned during the Dust Bowl-era of the 1930s, rather than reassigning the land to the Sioux, the federal government transferred much of the abandoned land to federal agencies, for instance, the National Park Service took over part of the modern National Grasslands and the Bureau of Land Management was assigned other land for management. In some cases, the US appropriated more land from the reduced reservations, as in the case of the WW2-era Badlands Bombing Range, taken from the Oglala Sioux of Pine Ridge. Although the range was declared surplus to USAF needs in the 1960s, it was transferred to the National Park Service rather than returned to the tribe's communal ownership.
Considering the Black Hills sacred and illegally taken, the Lakota pursued a claim against the US government for the return of the land. In the 1980 "United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians" the United States Supreme Court upheld their position in that the land had been taken illegally, and the US government offered financial compensation. The Oglala Lakota are persisting in their demand to have the land returned to their nation; the account with their compensation is earning interest.
Both inside and outside the reservation boundaries in West River, the Lakota are an integral part of the region and its history: many towns have Lakota names, such as "Owanka", "Wasta", and "Oacoma". Towns such as Hot Springs, Timber Lake, and Spearfish are named in English after the original Lakota names. Some rivers and mountains retain Lakota names. The traditional Lakota game of buffalo and antelope graze together with cattle and sheep, and bison ranching is increasing on the Great Plains. Numerous monuments honor Lakota and European-American heroes and events.

George Henry Bogert

George Henry Bogert (February 6, 1864 – December 13, 1944) was an American landscape painter.
Life and work.
George Henry Bogert was born in New York City, the son of Henry Bogert and Helen Anderson Evans. His father was a paper manufacturer, and a noted collector of coins, medals, and writings on numismatics. As a student at the National Academy of Design and later under Thomas Eakins in New York City, he early on displayed the talent that later brought him fame. 
In 1884 he went to France and painted landscapes for a time at Grez, near the forest of Fontainebleau, afterwards going to Paris, where he studied under Colin, Aimé Morot, and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. Four years later he returned to New York and thereafter until his death was a frequent exhibitor at the Society of American Artists, the National Academy of Design, and elsewhere. In 1899, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member.
It was in 1901 that his landscape work began to attract attention. At the outset his achievements were tentative, but evidenced sincerity and promise. Within a few years it was evident that the artist was rapidly approaching the completeness that marks reflective work, and his paintings testified to the maturity of his style. In his summer journeys abroad he painted at Etaples on the French coast with Eugène Boudin and in the Netherlands and on the Isle of Wight. In these surroundings he found sympathetic material for many of his subsequent works. His compositions were said to preserve that truth in nature which represents true art and he became a profound synthesist, ever seeking to secure unity of ensemble and endeavoring to avoid striking a false note in his efforts to produce harmony of color and effect. His success in this direction is strikingly illustrated in his composition ""Sea and Rain"", and in many of his pictures the scope of his artistic vision is wide and comprehensive. A most prolific painter whose work found a ready and discriminating market. Bogert was exceedingly versatile, a characteristic that prevented him from having pronounced style.
In 1911 an exhibit of his work was held at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, and attracted widespread notice. His work is represented in the permanent collection of the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, thanks to a gift from the New York merchant, George Hearn. In 1911 and 1914 he painted at the Old Lyme Art Colony in Old Lyme, Connecticut. 
In 1895 Bogert executed ""The English Channel from St. Ives to Lelant"", which was purchased by popular subscriptions in St. Louis and presented to the St. Louis Museum of Fine Arts. He won honorable mention at the Pennsylvanian Academy of Fine Arts in 1892; was awarded the Webb Prize at the exhibition of American artists in 1868 for ""Evening, Honfleur""; received the first Hallgarten Prize at the National Academy of Design in 1899; won a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900; was awarded silver medals at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904, and received gold medals from the American Society of Arts in 1902 and 1907. 
Bogerts work has been displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Gallery, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Huntington Library, Pennsylvania Academy, Brooklyn Museum, Edinburgh Museum in Scotland, Shanghai Club in China, Minneapolis Institute of Art, and others, also in private collections, including those of Andrew Carnegie, Clarence Mackay, and Thomas B. Clark.
He married on June 2, 1898, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Margaret Austin Merryman, daughter of Joseph P. Merryman, and had two children: Austin (died in childhood), and Eleanor Bogert, who married Charles Bradford Welles. He died in New York City.

Terence O'Donnell

Terence O'Donnell (1924 - 2001) was an American writer. He was born in Portland, Oregon and graduated from the University of Chicago. He resided in Portland most of his life and worked at the Oregon Historical Society. During the latter part of his life, he divided his time between an apartment on the South Park Blocks in Portland and "Crank's Roost," a home he designed and built on the Washington coast, in the Victorian village of Seaview on the Long Beach Peninsula.
O'Donnell lived in Iran from 1957-1971. He is perhaps best known as the author of the "Garden of the Brave in War: Recollections of Iran", which was published in 1980, during the Iran hostage crisis. The book was praised by critics and, although it did not attain broad popular readership, it is now regarded as a classic work. It is told from a very personal perspective, with observations about daily life and culture in southern Iran.

Howard Jacobson

Howard Jacobson (born 25 August 1942) is a Man Booker Prize-winning British author and journalist. He is best known for writing comic novels that often revolve around the dilemmas of British Jewish characters.
Background.
Jacobson was born in Manchester, raised in Prestwich, and was educated at Stand Grammar School in Whitefield, before going on to study English at Downing College, Cambridge under F. R. Leavis. He lectured for three years at the University of Sydney before returning to England to teach at Selwyn College, Cambridge. His later teaching posts included a period at Wolverhampton Polytechnic from 1974 to 1980.
Although Jacobson has described himself as "a Jewish Jane Austen" (in response to being described as "the English Phillip Roth"), he also states, "I'm not by any means conventionally Jewish. I don't go to shul. What I feel is that I have a Jewish mind, I have a Jewish intelligence. I feel linked to previous Jewish minds of the past. I don't know what kind of trouble this gets somebody into, a disputatious mind. What a Jew is has been made by the experience of 5,000 years, that's what shapes the Jewish sense of humour, that's what shaped Jewish pugnacity or tenaciousness." He maintains that "comedy is a very important part of what I do."
Jacobson married his first wife when he was 22. He married his second wife, Rosalin Sadler, in 1965; they divorced in 1995. In 2005, Jacobson was married for the third time, to radio and TV documentary maker Jenny De Yong. He stated, "My last wife. I'm home, it's right".
Writing career.
His time at Wolverhampton was to form the basis of his first novel, "Coming from Behind", a campus comedy about a failing polytechnic that plans to merge facilities with a local football club. The episode of teaching in a football stadium in the novel is, according to Jacobson in a 1985 BBC interview, the only portion of the novel based on a true incident. He also wrote a travel book in 1987, titled "In the Land of Oz", which was researched during his time as a visiting academic in Sydney.
His fiction, particularly in the six novels he has published since 1998, is characterised chiefly by a discursive and humorous style. Recurring subjects in his work include male–female relations and the Jewish experience in Britain in the mid- to late-20th century. He has been compared to prominent Jewish-American novelists such as Philip Roth, in particular for his habit of creating doppelgängers of himself in his fiction.
His 1999 novel "The Mighty Walzer", about a teenage table tennis champion, won the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for comic writing. It is set in the Manchester of the 1950s and Jacobson, himself a table tennis fan in his teenage years, admits that there is more than an element of autobiography in it. His 2002 novel "Who's Sorry Now?" – the central character of which is a Jewish luggage baron of South London – and his 2006 novel "Kalooki Nights" were longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Jacobson described "Kalooki Nights" as "the most Jewish novel that has ever been written by anybody, anywhere". It won the 2007 JQ Wingate Prize.
As well as writing fiction, he also contributes a weekly column for "The Independent" newspaper as an op-ed writer. In recent times, he has, on several occasions, attacked anti-Israel boycotts, and for this reason has been labelled a "liberal Zionist".
In October 2010 Jacobson won the Man Booker Prize for his novel "The Finkler Question", which was the first comic novel to win the prize since Kingsley Amis's "The Old Devils" in 1986. The book, published by Bloomsbury, explores what it means to be Jewish today and is also about "love, loss and male friendship". Andrew Motion, the chair of the judges, said: ""The Finkler Question" is a marvellous book: very funny, of course, but also very clever, very sad and very subtle. It is all that it seems to be and much more than it seems to be. A completely worthy winner of this great prize." His novel "Zoo Time" won the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize (2013), Jacobson's second time winning the prize (the first in 1999 for "The Mighty Walzer").
Broadcasting.
He has also worked as a broadcaster. Two recent television programmes include Channel 4's "Howard Jacobson Takes on the Turner", in 2000, and "The South Bank Show" in 2002 featured an edition entitled "Why the Novel Matters". An earlier profile went out in the series in 1999 and a television documentary entitled "My Son the Novelist" preceded it as part of the "Arena" series in 1985. His two non-fiction books – "Roots Schmoots: Journeys Among Jews" (1993) and "Seriously Funny: From the Ridiculous to the Sublime" (1997) – were turned into television series.
In 2010 Jacobson presented "Creation", the first part of the Channel 4 series "The Bible: A History".
On 3 November 2010, Jacobson appeared in an Intelligence Squared debate (stop bashing Christians, Britain is becoming an anti-Christian country) in favour of the motion.
On 6 February 2011 Jacobson appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. His musical choices included works by J. S. Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Louis Armstrong as well as the rare 1964 single "Look at Me" by The Whirlwinds. His favourite was "You’re a Sweetheart" by Al Bowlly with Lew Stone and His Band.
Views on the Middle East.
Jacobson has tackled Jewish anti-Zionists and those Jews that reject Israel in his novel "The Finkler Question". According to Professor Edward Alexander, amongst those he parodies and criticises is musician Gilad Atzmon.

Daintree River

The Daintree River runs through the Daintree Rainforest in the Cape Tribulation region of Queensland in northern Australia. It is located about 100 kilometres northwest of Cairns in far north tropical Queensland and drains an area of 2,125 square kilometres. The river, along with the Daintree Rainforest encircled by it was given Wet Tropics Word Heritage Listing in 1988. The area is now primarily a tourist attraction.
Attraction.
People are drawn to the area for its ancient vegetation, scenic surroundings and the vast array of native wildlife and plant species that inhabit the area. Currently, there is no bridge to enable crossing the river, so access is limited to the Daintree River Ferry, a commercial ferry that traverses the river for the purpose of tourism. Other features that surround the river include Black Mountain, Daintree Range, Thornton Peak and the Cape Tribulation Rainforest. The Daintree River is home to a dazzling array of tropical life. It supports saltwater and freshwater marine life, including the saltwater crocodile. The mouth of the Daintree River opens onto a giant sandbar that shifts with each changing tide. The river winds through thick mangrove swamps where the water remains very salty. As it progresses through the rainforest, the water turns fresh. At this convergence point, an abundance of wildlife congregate, particularly fish.
History.
Due to the ever-shifting deep centre of the sandbar, entering the Daintree River has always been a problem for ship captains. The area was missed by Captain Cook when passing in the voyage where his ship was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef. The Daintree River was first discovered in 1873 after Europeans were attracted to nearby regions due to its vast natural reserves of gold. The river was discovered by George Elphinstone Dalrymple, who was the Queensland Gold Commissioner on the Gilbert gold field at that time. He named the river after Richard Daintree, who was an English geologist and the Agent-General for Queensland in London.
World Heritage listing.
World Heritage Wet Tropic Listing was given to the river in recognition of "its outstanding natural universal value as an outstanding example representing; the major stages of Earths evolutionary history, significant ongoing ecological and biological processes, superlative natural phenomena and as containing important and significant habitats for in situ conservation of biological diversity. The river is part of the much larger Daintree Rainforest, region in Northern Queensland encompassing 894,000 hectres.
Flooding.
The river is surrounded by mountains and deep valleys. Combined with the climatic conditions of the area the river is prone to quickly developing floods with little warning due to the high rainfalls on the 1,000 metre high mountain ranges around the catchment and the influence of the cyclonic forces in the adjacent Coral Sea. In March 1996, record flood levels swamped roads and properties throughout the Daintree region. Statistics gathered at the time recorded 606 millimetres of rain falling in 24 hours.
In 2011, two new causeways were completed over Cape Tribulation Road, making the drive mostly floodproof in all but the most severe rain events. In particular, the notorious bottleneck at Cooper Creek was raised three metres.
Indigenous population.
The Kuku Yulanji is the indigenous people who once inhabited the regions surrounded by the Daintree River. The tribespeople were hunter-gatherers who lived in groups of eight to twelve, camping along the banks of the river and living on a staple diet that included a selection of bush tucker harvested from the vegetation from the forest surrounding the Daintree. It has been estimated that the tribe resided on the banks of the Daintree river for over 9,000 years.
Flora and fauna.
The river and its surroundings are home to some of the most primitive forms of animal and plant life in the world. The surrounding mountains and valleys provided protection from the forces to adapt to climate change by sheltering several species of plants. A notable example is the primitive She-oak "Gymnostoma australianum". This pine-like tree is the only remaining species in the Gymnostoma group of plants in Australia, and is now restricted to very isolated pockets north of the Daintree River. The genus was once widespread throughout Gondwana, and its relatives are still found in parts of the Pacific and south-east Asia.
Of the five species of ringtail possum found in north Queensland rainforests, the Cinereus ringtail possum ("Pseudochirulus cinereus") is almost wholly restricted to the Daintree catchment. Within the park, this species is found only in upland rainforest on Thornton Peak and the upper reaches of the Daintree and Mossman Rivers. Once considered a light-coloured form of the Herbert River ringtail possum, commonly found throughout the Atherton Tablelands, it was described as a distinct species in 1989. Black and white Striped possums ("Dactylopsila trivirgata") are quite common throughout the park, particularly in the coastal lowlands north of the Daintree River, although to see one while spotlighting requires a mixture of luck and know-how.
Due to the river's isolation, saltwater crocodiles - once threatened in the region due to hunting - have flourished in recent years, beneficiaries of legislation that protects them. There have been numerous reports of deaths in the Daintree River from crocodile attacks, so it is important not to step close to the riverbank, or stay within the confines of boats, and absolutely never swim in the river.

Deconstruction therapy

Deconstruction therapy was developed by the British underground philosopher Michael Swann. 
He envisioned a process by which the individual adopts new personalities, seemingly at random, constructing new histories to fit them and lives a new life. In several of his works he refers to the process as "meta-paradigm engineering".
The theory behind deconstruction theory/meta-paradigm engineering is that, over the course of a number of these paradigm shifts, the patient (or "explorer" as Swann would have it) becomes aware of certain aspects of their personality which remain constant throughout the process and can choose to deal with those they feel to be negative.
Being a very radical therapy, Swann's approach has garnered much criticism from the psychiatric orthodoxy although he claims to have had astonishing results, primarily in the field of sexual abuse therapy.

DTE Energy Electric Company

DTE Energy Electric Company (Formerly The Detroit Edison Company), founded in 1903, is an investor-owned electric utility which serves most of Southeast Michigan. Its parent company, DTE Energy (), provides energy services to a variety of clients beyond the DTE Energy Electric Company's service area.
History.
Detroit Edison was part of a large holding company called North American Edison Company. North American's stock had once been one of the twelve component stocks of the May 1896 original Dow Jones Industrial Average. North American Company was broken up by the Securities and Exchange Commission, following the United States Supreme Court decision of April 1, 1946.
After that Detroit Edison operated independently, and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol DTE through the mid-1990s. In early 1996, it became an operating subsidiary of the new holding company, DTE Energy Company, which replaced Detroit Edison Company on the stock exchange, and took over the trading ticker symbol.
Power generation.
The utility operates eleven fossil-fuel generating plants, as well as the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station. The company is co-owner, with Consumers Energy, of the Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant, a hydroelectric pumped storage facility in Ludington, Michigan. DTE uses fossil fuels (mainly coal) to generate 80-85 percent of its total electrical output, with the bulk of the remainder coming from nuclear power. 
At 3,300 MW, DTE's Monroe Power Plant has the third largest generating capacity of any coal-fired power plant in North America. Only Georgia Power's Plant Bowen located near Atlanta, Georgia and Ontario Power Generation's Nanticoke Generating Station in Canada have more generating capacity. 
DTE operates the coal-fired St. Clair Power Plant in St. Clair, Michigan, and the Belle River Power Plant in East China, Michigan on the west bank of the St. Clair River. Also in St. Clair County lies the Greenwood Energy Center, a natural gas-burning and fuel oil-burning plant. Farther north in Harbor Beach is the coal-fired Harbor Beach Power Plant, which the company has announced will cease operations sometime between August 2013 and April 2015. 
On the Detroit River, DTE operates the Conner Creek Power Plant in the city of Detroit, the River Rouge Power Plant in River Rouge and the Trenton Channel Power Plant in Trenton, which all burn coal.
Energy transmission.
As a condition of electric utility deregulation in Michigan, DTE Energy was forced to sell off Detroit Edison's sister subsidiary involved in high-voltage energy transmission: International Transmission Co. (ITC).
Energy distribution.
Detroit Edison's near 11-gigawatt generating capacity is offered to its service area, which encompasses 13 counties in the southeastern portion of Michigan's lower peninsula. Energy is distributed throughout Huron, Tuscola, Sanilac, Saint Clair, Lapeer, Livingston, Ingham, Oakland, Macomb, Wayne, Washtenaw, Lenawee and Monroe counties by over a million utility poles and of power lines. 
Detroit Edison's distribution line voltages are three-phase 4,800 volts (Delta) 4,800/8,320 volts (wye) and 7,620/13,200 volts (Wye) . All new distribution circuits constructed after 1959 are 13,200 volts. The 8,320 volt distribution lines are located in Pontiac, Michigan in an area that was served by Consumers Power Company until the mid-1980s when the area was acquired by Detroit Edison. Edison's subtransmission line voltages are 24,000 volts and 41,600 volts.
DTE Rail Service Inc..
With the bankruptcy of the Penn Central Transportation railroad in 1970, Detroit Edison sought to continue transporting coal from the Monongahela mines in Pennsylvania to a brand new power plant in Monroe, Michigan. However, the bankruptcy of Penn Central left Detroit Edison short of motive power and under capacitated coal hoppers. Detroit Edison then chose to purchase brand new locomotives and coal cars to fit their needs. Purchasing EMD SD40's and GE U30C's for mainline motive power as well as High-Side Articulated Gondolas (with a capacity of 185,000 pounds), this new equipment allowed Detroit Edison to move more coal "en masse" than what Penn Central was able to do with their equipment. The trains were maintained by Detroit Edison officials but operated by Penn Central crews.
By the late 1980s or early 1990, Detroit Edison discontinued use of their equipment, as Conrail began to supply enough locomotives and rolling stock to meet the power company's needs.

Inconsistent comparison

An inconsistent comparison is a misleading argument popular in advertising. For example, an advertisement might say "product X is less expensive than product A, has better quality than product B, and has more features than product C". This is designed to give the impression that product X is better than products A, B, and C in all respects, but doesn't actually make that claim. In fact, product A may be the most expensive, product B may be the lowest quality, and product C may have the fewest features of the three. So, the original statement really only means "product X is not the most expensive, lowest quality, fewest feature product on the market". That would hardly be as effective of an advertisement, however.

Tingha, New South Wales

Tingha is a small town on the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales, Australia in Guyra Shire. It is 30 kilometres south of Inverell and 629 kilometres north-north-east of Sydney. Tingha is an Aboriginal word for "flat or level".
History.
Before European settlement the Tingha area was occupied by the Nucoorilma, a sub-group of the Murri Aboriginal people. Many of their descendants still live in the surrounding area.
Tingha was first settled in 1841 by Sydney Hudson Darby and became a mining town after tin was discovered there in the 1870s. Within a year Australia’s first commercial tin mines were operating at a private settlement known as Armidale Crossing. Over 6,000 people arrived and more than 25% of the miners were Chinese. The Wing Hing Long Museum is a reminder of that heritage. "Armidale Crossing" Post Office opened on 1 September 1872 and was renamed "Tingha" the next month.
The village was proclaimed a town in 1885. Initially there were enough readily accessible surface deposits to make a good living without using machinery as the Chinese did. The first school was established by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1890. In the 1890s drought came to the district and the easily obtained deposits of tin were exhausted leading to a loss in population.
By the early 1900s the mining boom was over and Tingha's population had dwindled to just a few hundred people. Shortly after this, large companies moved into the area to mine the less accessible tin.
Today.
The main industry nowadays is agriculture with some fossicking in the area. Tin dredging and mining has continued on a scale that varies according to international price fluctuations.
Tingha has a hospital, pre-school, caravan park, sports and recreation club, a first aid post, hotels plus other shops and services to supply daily needs. Tingha's 'Swimming Hole' is a large man made pool which was once a mining excavation. One of the main attractions around Tingha is "Green Valley Farm" Entertainment Park.

Triangular prism

In geometry, a triangular prism is a three-sided prism; it is a polyhedron made of a triangular base, a translated copy, and 3 faces joining corresponding sides.
Equivalently, it is a pentahedron of which two faces are parallel, while the surface normals of the other three are in the same plane (which is not necessarily parallel to the base planes). These three faces are parallelograms. All cross-sections parallel to the base faces are the same triangle.
As a semiregular (or uniform) polyhedron.
A right triangular prism is semiregular or, more generally, a uniform polyhedron if the base faces are equilateral triangles, and the other three faces are squares. It can be seen as a truncated trigonal hosohedron, represented by Schläfli symbol t{2,3}. Alternately it can be seen as the Cartesian product of a triangle and a line segment, and represented by the product {3}x{}. The dual of a triangular prism is a triangular bipyramid.
The symmetry group of a right 3-sided prism with triangular base is "D3h" of order 12. The rotation group is "D3" of order 6. The symmetry group does not contain inversion.
Volume.
The volume of any prism is the product of the area of the base and the distance between the two bases. In this case the base is a triangle so we simply need to compute the area of the triangle and multiply this by the length of the prism:
formula_1
where b is the triangle base length, h is the triangle height, and l is the length between the triangles.
Related polyhedra and tilings.
This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of uniform truncated polyhedra with vertex configurations (3.2n.2n), and [n,3] Coxeter group symmetry.
This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of cantellated polyhedra with vertex figure (3.4.n.4), and continues as tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These vertex-transitive figures have (*n32) reflectional symmetry.

Compounds.
There are 4 uniform compounds of triangular prisms:
Honeycombs.
There are 9 uniform honeycombs that include triangular prism cells:
Related polytopes.
The triangular prism is first in a dimensional series of semiregular polytopes. Each progressive uniform polytope is constructed vertex figure of the previous polytope. Thorold Gosset identified this series in 1900 as containing all regular polytope facets, containing all simplexes and orthoplexes (equilateral triangles and squares in the case of the triangular prism). In Coxeter's notation the triangular prism is given the symbol −121.
Four dimensional space.
The triangular prism exists as cells of a number of four-dimensional uniform polychora, including:

Gabriel Zwilling

Gabriel Zwilling (c. 1487 – 1 May 1558) was a German Lutheran and Protestant Reformer born near Annaberg, Electorate of Saxony. He was educated in Wittenberg and Erfurt. He like Martin Luther was a member of the Augustinian order, which he left in 1521.
Zwilling became prominent in the Wittenberg reform movement in mid-1521, when Luther was secured in the Wartburg after the Diet of Worms. Along with Carlstadt, Zwilling guided the Wittenberg movement in a more radical direction. In January 1522 he participated in iconoclasm in Wittenberg.
When Luther returned to Wittenberg and regained control in March 1522, Zwilling publicly admitted his errors, and gave his support to Luther’s more conservative vision of reform. He became a "prediger" (“preacher”) in Altenburg in 1522, and moved to Torgau in 1523 where he became successively "prediger", pastor (1525), and superintendent (1529). He was removed from his final office because he opposed the Leipzig Interim of 1549. Zwilling died in Torgau.

New Zealand Legion

The New Zealand Legion was a political organisation founded in New Zealand during the Great Depression. Its ideology was a mixture of nationalism, individualism, and social conservatism. It is sometimes considered to be a fascist (or at least crypto-fascist) group, although the group itself did not see itself in this light.
History.
The New Zealand Legion was a successor to the New Zealand National Movement, which had been founded by a group of people dissatisfied with the United-Reform coalition government, who broke away soon after 1930. The group included John Ormond, a former Independent Reform candidate influenced by Albert Davy (although Davy himself did not join the Legion).
In particular, the government was accused of adopting "socialist" policies to combat the Depression, and of attempting to appease left-wingers rather than resist them. The New Zealand Legion presented itself as an alternative solution to the Depression, winning support from conservatives who believed that action was necessary but who rejected the socialist approach.
The Legion reached its height in late 1933, when it is believed to have had around 20,000 members. Much of its support came from smaller provincial towns, particularly in the Hawkes Bay area. The Legion had little in the way of organisation, however, and rarely set out any detailed programs. By the end of 1934, the Legion had dwindled away to virtually nothing.
Ideology.
The New Zealand Legion used a number of themes in its campaigning. One was nationalism, with the Legion arguing for greater self-reliance (particularly from Britain) and national unity. Another was individualism — harshly critical of "state paternalism", the Legion promoted what it saw as the right of people to be free from (and if necessary, to resist) government interference in their affairs. There were also calls for greater public morality and self-sacrifice "for the sake of the country". Although the Legion was involved in politics, it did not see itself as a political party, and professed itself opposed to the party system.
Some, particularly on the left, accused the Legion of being a fascist organisation, but this is a contentious claim. In particular, the Legion's belief in individualism is pointed out as contrary to fascist principle. After the Legion's eventual demise, Robert Campbell Begg, its one-time leader, was approached by the Nazis while on a world trip, but is reported to have found their philosophy "absurd".
