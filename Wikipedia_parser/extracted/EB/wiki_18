Religion in Ukraine

Ukraine in religious geography lies on the boundaries separating Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Islamic spheres of influence. Traces of the cultural influence of Catholic Lithuania and Poland, of Kievan and Muscovite Orthodoxy, and of Tatar and Ottoman Islam combine with the Soviet legacy of promoting atheism to shape the various present-day beliefs and professed beliefs of Ukrainian citizens.
History.
In pre-historic times and in the early Middle Ages, the territories of present-day Ukraine supported different tribes practicing their traditional Indo-European, non-Abrahamic religions (though note for example the non-Indo-European Tengrism of Old Great Bulgaria in the Ukrainian lands in the 7th century CE). Byzantine-rite Christianity first became prominent about the turn of the first millennium. (Later writers who sought to put Kievan Christianity on the same level of primacy as Byzantine Christianity imagined that the Apostle Andrew himself had visited the site where the city of Kiev would later arise.)
In the 10th century the emerging state of Kievan Rus' came increasingly under the cultural influence of the Byzantine Empire. The first recorded Rus' convert to Eastern Orthodoxy, the Princess Saint Olga, visited Constantinople in 945 or 957. In the 980s, according to tradition, Olga's grandson, Knyaz (Prince) Vladimir baptised his people in the Dnieper River. This began a long history of the dominance of the Eastern Orthodoxy in Ruthenia, a religious ascendancy that would later influence both Ukraine and Russia. Domination of Little Russia by Moscow eventually led to the decline of Uniate Catholicism in Tsarist-controlled Ukraine.
Judaism has existed in the Ukrainian lands for approximately 2000 years: Jewish traders appeared in Greek colonies. After the 7th century Judaism influenced the neighbouring Khazar Khaganate. From the 13th century Ashkenazi Jewish presence in Ukraine increased significantly. In the 18th century a new teaching of Judaism originated and became established in the Ukrainian lands - Hasidism.
The Golden Horde (which adopted Islam in 1313) and the Sunni Ottoman Empire (which conquered the Ukrainian litoral in the 1470s) brought Islam to their subject territories in present-day Ukraine. Crimean Tatars accepted Islam as the state religion (1313-1502) of the Golden Horde and later as vassals of the Ottoman Empire (until the late 18th-century).
During the period of Soviet rule (1917-1991) the governing Soviet authorities officially promoted atheism and taught it in schools, while promoting various levels of persecution of religious believers and of their organizations. Only a small fraction of people remained official church-goers in that period, and the number of non-believers increased.
Religious structure of society.
General outlook.
[[File:Ukraine religion 2006 Razumkov center.svg|thumb|left|200px|"What religious group do you belong to?" Sociology poll by Razumkov Centre about the religious situation in Ukraine (2006)
Estimates compiled by the independent Razumkov Centre in a nationwide survey in 2003 found that 75.2 percent of the respondents believe in God and 22 percent said they did not believe in God. 37.4 percent said that they attended church on regular basis.
As of January 1, 2006, there were 30,507 registered religious organizations, including 29,262 religious communities; the Government estimated that there were approximately 1,679 unregistered religious communities. More than 90 percent of religiously active citizens were Christians, the majority Orthodox. Religious practice was generally stronger in the western part of the country due to Western Ukraine being part of Soviet Union for shorter period(1939–41; 1944–91).
The different confessions in Ukrainian society were estimated by the nationwide survey. The result differ from the official number of registered religious groups. Thus the Russian Orthodox church (today in Ukraine, it is called the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)) traditionally (since the times of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union) has enjoyed the favour of many local authorities.
The 2006 Razumkov Centre survey indicates:
All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations.
Since December of 1996 in Ukraine exists All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations that unites around 90-95% of religious communities of Ukraine. Since the end of 2003 parallel to the council exists Conference of leaders of Christian Churches of Ukraine. Affiliation in both assemblies is without any obligations. 
In 2007 the council was accounted for representatives of 19 organizations, in 2013 - only 18. The Conference of leaders was accounted for representatives of 9 churches.
Christian Orthodox.
Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate).
The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) (UOC) has 35 eparchies and 10,875 communities (approximately 68 percent of all Orthodox Christian communities in the country), most of which were located in the central, southern, and eastern oblasts. By 2007, the Church had 122 monasteries, 3519 monks and nuns, 7509 priests, 7755 churches with 840 churches being built. 
The Church is headed by the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine, Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan). This Church uses predominately the Old Slavonic language for services.
Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate.
The Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate (UOC-KP) was formed after independence and has been headed since 1995 by Patriarch Filaret (Denysenko) with the title Patriarch of Kiev and all Rus-Ukraine, who was earlier the Russian Orthodox Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine. The Church claims direct lineage to the Kievan Metropolia of Petro Mohyla.
The UOC-KP had 31 eparchies, 3,721 communities, and 2,816 clergy members. Approximately 60 percent of the UOC-KP faithful live in the western part of the country. The UOC-KP was not recognized by the Eastern Orthodox Communion.
The UOC-KP uses Ukrainian and Slavonic as liturgical languages.
Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.
The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) was founded in 1919 in Kiev. Banned during the Soviet era, it was legalized in 1989.
The church has 12 eparchies and 1,166 communities, approximately 70 percent of them in the western part of the country. The UAOC has 686 clergy members.
In the interest of the possible future unification of the country's Orthodox churches, it did not name a patriarch to succeed the late Patriarch Dmitriy. The UAOC was formally headed in the country by Metropolitan Methodij of Ternopil and Podil; however, the large eparchies of Kharkiv-Poltava, Lviv, Rivne-Volyn, and Tavriya have officially broken relations with Methodij and have asked to be placed under the direct jurisdiction of the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.
The UAOC uses the Ukrainian language.
Other Orthodox Churches.
There are also Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church, Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, Ruthenian True Orthodox Church, Romanian Orthodox Church (Metropolis of Bessarabia), Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church Canonical, Autonomous Ukrainian Orthodox Church in America, Ukrainian True Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Reformation Orthodox Church, Orthodox Russian Church, Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church - Apostolic (catacombic), and some very marginal (Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church - Apostolic, Autonomous Orthodox Church of Lviv, True Orthodox Church of Greece, Catacombic True Orthodox Church).
Catholics.
Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.
The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) constituted the second largest group of believers after the Christian Orthodox churches. The Union of Brest formed the Church in 1596 to unify Orthodox and Roman Catholic believers. Outlawed by the Soviet Union in 1946 and legalized in 1987, the UGCC was for forty-three years the single largest banned religious community in the world.
The UGCC had 18 eparchies, 3,433 communities, and 2,136 clergy members. The UGCC's members, who constituted a majority of the believers in western Ukraine, numbered approximately four million.
Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk is the present head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. 
The UGCC uses the Ukrainian language.
Roman Catholic Church.
The Roman Catholic Church is traditionally associated with historical pockets of citizens of Polish ancestry who lived mainly in the central and western regions.
The Roman Catholic Church had 7 dioceses, 879 communities, and 499 clergy members serving approximately one million persons.
The Church uses the Polish, Latin, Ukrainian and Russian languages.
Other Catholics.
Armenian Apostolic Church, and Armenian Catholic Church
Ukrainian Protestant Churches.
Protestants make from 1% to nearly 3% of the population in Ukraine, but they constitute over 25% of the church network in the country. The biggest is the Christians of Pentecostal confession with over 2,500 churches and over 250,000 members that make several unions and also there are 1,560 Charismatic churches. There are over 2,500 Evangelical Christian Baptists unions with over 150,000 members, plus Methodists, Mennonites, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and others. There is also a Sub-Carpathian Reformed Church with about 140,000 members, which is one of the earliest Protestant communities in the country.
Other Christian churches and movements.
The Embassy of God of Sunday Adelaja maintains a significant presence throughout the country, as do other neopentecostal groups. Jehovah’s Witnesses are strong, with 265,985 adherents reported in the movement’s 2013 "Yearbook". In 2010 the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) dedicated its Kyiv Ukraine Temple, and in 2012 claimed a membership more than 11,000 in 57 congregations in Ukraine. Other active movements include Seventh-day Adventists, the The Local Churches of Witness Lee, United Pentecostal Church (Oneness), and Branhamites.
Islam.
According to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, there are an estimated 456,000 Muslims in Ukraine. In the Crimea, the Ukrainian Muslims make up to 12% of the population. A major part of the south steppes of modern Ukraine at a certain period of time belonged to the Turkic peoples, most of whom were Muslims since the fall of the Khazar Khanate.
The Crimean Tatars are the only indigenous Muslim ethnic group in the country. The Nogays, another Muslim group who lived in the steppes of southern Ukraine, emigrated to Turkey in the 18th-19th century. In addition, there are Muslim communities in all major Ukrainian cities representing Soviet-era migrants from Muslim backgrounds. There are approximately 150 mosques in Ukraine. Many Muslim mosques use the Crimean Tatarian, Arabic, Azeri, Tatarian and Russian languages.
There are no single administrative center, instead there are five of them: Spiritual Administration of Crimea Muslims (DUMK) - Crimean Tatars; Spiritual Administration of Ukraine Muslims (DUMU) - people of Caucasus, Crimean and Volga Tatars, Pakistani, Afghans, Arabs, Russians, Ukrainians; Spiritual Center of Ukraine Muslims (DCUM) - Volga Tatars; Kiev muftiat - Kazan and Volga Tatars; UMMA - Arabs, Uzbeks, Russians, Ukrainians.
Judaism.
The size of the current Jewish population varied. The State Committee of Statistics estimated that there were 103,600 Jews. Some Jewish leaders, said the Jewish population could be as high as 300 thousand. Observers believed that 35 to 40 percent of the Jewish population was active communally; there were 240 registered Jewish organizations. Most observant Jews were Orthodox. There were 104 Chabad-Lubavitch communities in the country. The Progressive (Reform) Jewish movement had forty-eight communities. There are four major branches: Orthodox, Conservators, Progressive reformers, Reconstructionists.
Judaic congregations use Russian, Hebrew, Yiddish and Ukrainian.
Paganism.
The largest Rodnover group (federation) is the Obiednannia Ridnoviriv Ukrayiny ( "Native Faith Association of Ukraine"), founded in 1998 by Halyna Lozko. The federation has chapters in Kiev, Kharkiv, Odessa, Boryspil, Chernihiv, Mykolaiv, Lviv and Yuzhnoukrainsk. Lev Sylenko founded his RUNVira group in 1966 in Chicago, USA, and only opened their first temple in the mother country of Ukraine after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The current headquarters of RUNVira is in Spring Glen, New York, USA. Scholars estimated 95.000 Rodnovers (0.2%) in Ukraine in the 2000s.

Mark Power

Mark Power (born 1959) is an English photographer, born in Harpenden, England. He is a member of Magnum Photos and Professor of Photography in the The Faculty of Arts and Architecture at the University of Brighton.
History.
Power studied Fine Art at Brighton Polytechnic (1978–1981), and then travelled extensively, discovering a love for photography along the way. Upon his return, he worked as a freelance for several UK publications and charities.
Power primarily shoots his work on large format film, but has more recently diversified into short film making.
Between 1992 and 1996, Power embarked on "The Shipping Forecast" — a project that involved travelling to and photographing all 31 areas covered by the Shipping Forecast broadcast on BBC Radio 4. This project was published as a book and was a touring exhibition across the UK and France. He used a Volkswagen campervan as his mode of transport for the project, echoing the late Tony Ray-Jones, whose work has similarities in style and meaning to Power's.
Between 1997 and 2000, he was commissioned to document the Millennium Dome in London, a project that resulted in another touring exhibition and the accompanying book, "Superstructure". Around this time his technical methods changed and he began to use color film and a large format camera. This was followed by "The Treasury Project", published in 2002, which recorded the renovation of the UK government's treasury building on Whitehall, London.
In 2003, Power undertook another personal project, using the "London A–Z" map as inspiration. The work, titled "26 Different Endings," is a collection of images examining the areas on the outer boundaries of the map. The project was exhibited at the Centre of Visual Art at the University of Brighton, and was published as a book in 2007.
Between 1988 and 2002 Power was a member of Network Photographers. In 2002 he became a nominee of Magnum Photos, an associate in 2005 and a full member in 2007.
Between 1992 and 2004 Power was Senior Lecturer in Photography at the University of Brighton, becoming Professor of Photography in 2004, until the present.

Loving Annabelle

Loving Annabelle is a 2006 film directed by Katherine Brooks. Based on "Mädchen in Uniform", it tells the story of a boarding school student who falls in love with her teacher. It was filmed at Marymount High School in Los Angeles.
Plot.
Annabelle Tillman, the daughter of a senator, is sent to a Catholic boarding school after being expelled from two of her previous schools. Simone Bradley, a poetry teacher at the school, is in charge of her dormitory. Annabelle shares the dormitory with an amiable classmate, Christen. Katherine, who tends to bully people, and Colins, a student with a nervous disposition, also share the room. 
Simone is a dependable and respectable teacher who occasionally bends the rules out of concern for her students. Her personal life is synonymous with abiding by the conventions of society and religion. Annabelle is her antiagent – with unrestrained behavior, unconventional choices and outright defiance for authority. 
Annabelle receives a stern rebuke from the principal, Mother Immaculata, for audaciously flaunting her Buddhist prayer beads. Simone is given the responsibility of controlling her. At first Simone requests the principal to move Annabelle to another dormitory but soon notices her maturity and sensitivity and convinces her to comply with the school regulations. In the process Annabelle falls in love with Simone.
Simone resists Annabelle’s delicate overtures until they are left alone at the school during spring break. Simone drives Annabelle to her beach house where Annabelle discovers painful personal details about Simone’s past. Annabelle holds Simone tightly in her arms as Simone breaks down. A deep emotional connection is established between the two. 
Simone fights a hard battle with herself but is eventually overpowered by Annabelle’s relentless pursuit. At the annual school dance, Annabelle goes up on stage with her guitar and sings a song for Simone. Simone, who is confused, runs outside, but Annabelle catches up with her. They kiss and end up going back to Simone's room to have sex.
The next morning Mother Immaculata walks in on them getting dressed and demands to see Simone in her office immediately. On being questioned if she did the right thing Simone admits that she loves Annabelle. Government officials arrest Simone and just as she is leaving, Annabelle places her most prized possession – the Buddhist prayer beads – in her hands. 
Annabelle tearfully looks at her pictures taken by Simone at the beach house while Simone is driven away. The movie ends with the following quote – ‘For one human being to love another that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks…the work for which all other work is but preparation.’
Alternate ending.
The DVD release contains an alternate ending in which Annabelle can be seen driving to an unknown destination. She stops off at a road-side store and picks up the latest copy of the newspaper. The headline is that no charges have been brought on the teacher in the lesbian sex scandal at a school. Annabelle is then seen parking on the side of the road before going down towards Miss Bradley's beach house.

Winter Olympic coins

Although the first Olympic coin can be traced back to 480 BC, the modern Olympics did not see its first commemoratives until 1951. The original concept of Olympic coins was that the Greeks believed that coins brought the general public closer to the Olympic games. The premise was that those who could not attend the games could at least have a tangible souvenir of the event.
In 1951, the government of Finland authorized the striking of the first modern Olympic coin, a 500 Markkaa. The first Winter Games coin that numismatists could add to their collection was in 1964. An Official Act of the Government of Austria authorized the Austrian Mint to strike a commemorative 50 Schilling coin for the event.
With the exception of Canada’s Lucky Loonie program and its 2007 25-cent pieces to commemorate the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games, it is rare that Olympic coins are minted for circulation. Traditionally, Olympic coins are numismatic coins.

1988 Calgary Olympics.
Heading into the 1980s, the Olympics would return to Canada. The city of Calgary would host the 1988 Winter Olympics. Starting in 1985, the Federal Government, under the leadership of then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, issued a ten coin set to help finance and commemorate the Olympic games. In similar style to the Montreal Olympics, the RCM would introduce coins with a face value that had never been used before. Said coins would feature a $20 face value. These coins were issued in Proof quality only, and were sold with the partnership of the Royal Bank of Canada. Unlike the Montreal coins, mintage was limited to 5,000,000 coins and this would mark the first time that any silver coin had edge lettering on it. Said lettering was 'XV OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES – JEUX D'OLYMPIQUES D'HIVER.'

The RCM plans to release 12 twenty-five dollar coins, 10 seventy-five dollar coins, 3 14-karat coins, and 4 one kilogram coins (two in silver, two in gold).
With regards to the circulation coins, one of the novelties is that D.G. Regina will be removed from the Queen's effigy, making the 25-cent coins the first "godless circulating coins" since the 1911 issue of King George V. The first circulating $1 coin will be dated 2008 but the obverse will be the standard effigy of Queen Elizabeth II by Susanna Blunt with the wording "ELIZABETH II" and "D.G.

Vdisk

In storage virtualization, virtual disk (VD) or vdisk is a virtual logical disk or volume with which a computer or application performs I/O operations. Generally it is provided by a storage-virtualization device that is a part of storage area network (SAN). the term "vdisk" is used in HP EVA disk arrays and in IBM SAN Volume Controller. 
The disk is classed as virtual due to the way it maps to the physical storage capacity it represents. Most virtual-storage systems include a meta-data mapping table which translates the incoming (virtual) disk identifier, and LBA (logical block addressing) to a physical disk identifier and LBA. 
The virtualization granularity depends on the implementation. Some virtualized systems simply provide what may be thought of more as disk aggregation and so the granularity is a physical disk itself. True virtualization systems actually break down the physical disks into smaller "chunks", called extents. This allows spreading a single virtual disk across many physical disks; such parallelizing of the disk access can deliver improved performance over a non-virtualized system.

Lasioderma serricorne

Lasioderma serricorne, commonly known as the cigarette beetle, cigar beetle, or tobacco beetle, is very similar in appearance to the drugstore beetle ("Stegobium paniceum") and the common furniture beetle ("Anobium punctatum"), and all three species belong to the family Anobiidae.
"L. serricorne" is around 2–3 mm long, and brown in colour. The beetles, which can fly, live 2–6 weeks and do not feed as adults. They can be distinguished from "A. punctatum", by the fact that "A. punctatum" has a thorax which has a pronounced "hump" shape. "S. paniceum" and "L. serricorne" have thoraxes which have a much less obtuse looking angle when viewed from the side compared to "A. punctatum", and thus could be difficult to tell apart. However "S. paniceum" has a distinct three-segment "club" at the end of each antenna whereas "L. serricorne" has uniform filament antennae of eleven segments. "L. serricorne" also has much weaker punctures on the surface of the wing covers (elytra) than the other two species.
As indicated by its common name, the cigarette beetle is a pest of tobacco, both in the refined cigarette packet presentation and also as stored in hogsheads and bales, but is also a minor pest of oilcake, oilseeds, cereals, dried fruit, sage, flour, and some animal products.
The female beetle lays around 100 eggs loosely on the commodity. The hatching larvae are the "grow bag" stage of the insect are active and will move around on and bore into the product, feeding as they go. The complete life cycle takes 26 days at 37 °C and 120 days at 20 °C. "L. serricorne" cannot tolerate the cold; adults die within 6 days at 4 °C, and eggs survive 5 days at 0–5 °C.
The beetles carry a symbiotic yeast, "Symbiotaphrina kochii", that is transmitted to the next generation superficially on the eggs and carried internally in larvae and adults in the mycetome, a specialized organ that is linked to the gut. The yeast cells assist in the digestion of less nutritious foods, supply needed B-vitamins and sterols, and provide resistance to certain toxins.
Pest control.
Insect monitoring traps are available for "L. serricorne", which contain specific pheromones to attract male beetles, and help detect and monitor infestations. Infested bulk tobacco in the form of bales or hogsheads can be fumigated using methyl bromide or phosphine.
Dosage rates and treatment times with methyl bromide are 20 grams/m3 at 21 °C above and 32 grams/m3 for 48–72 hours at 7–20 °C. Methyl bromide is not recommended for cigar tobacco since it can produce off odours in the product.
With phosphine dosage rates are one gram of phosphine (equivalent to a 3-gram table) per m3 for 5 days at 12–15 °C and 4 days at 16–20 °C and 3 days above 20 °C. For localised infestations the approach is to find the infested product, dispose of it, and treat around the area with a residual insecticide such as cypermethrin to kill off any remaining beetles.

Newcastle-upon-Tyne (UK Parliament constituency)

Newcastle-upon-Tyne was a borough constituency in the county of Northumberland of the House of Commons of England to 1706 then of the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 and of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. It returned two Members of Parliament (MPs), elected by the bloc vote system. 
The constituency was abolished in 1918, being split into four divisions; Newcastle-upon-Tyne Central, Newcastle-upon-Tyne East, Newcastle-upon-Tyne North and Newcastle-upon-Tyne West.
Boundaries.
The constituency was based upon the town, later city, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne; in the historic county of Northumberland in North East England. In 1848, the constituency boundaries were described in "A Topographical Dictionary of England" 
The borough first exercised the elective franchise in the 23rd of Edward the First, since which time it has returned two members to parliament: the present electoral limits are co-extensive with those of the county of the town, comprising 5730 acres; the old boundaries, which were abrogated in 1832, included 2700 acres only.
When the House of Commons debated the boundaries to be used from 1832, the Tory Party suggested including Gateshead (to the south) and South Shields (to the east) within the Newcastle-upon-Tyne constituency. The Whigs resisted this idea, so these two neighbouring settlements were not incorporated into this seat. 
The boundaries of the parliamentary borough, as defined by the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832 (2 and 3 Wm. 4, c. 64), remained unchanged from 1832 until the area was divided into single member constituencies in 1918. These were not necessarily identical to the boundaries used for local government purposes. 
In the period after 1885, the constituency was surrounded by Wansbeck to the west and north, Tyneside to the north ease and east, Jarrow to the south east, Gateshead to the south, and Chester-le-Street to the south west.
Members of Parliament.
Party affiliations are derived from Stook Smith and Craig (see reference section below). Tory is used prior to the 1835 general election and Conservative from that time. Liberal candidates (as listed by Craig) before the formal creation of the party, shortly after the 1859 general election, are listed as Whig or Radical if the information is available in the work by Stooks Smith.
MPs, who were known by the same name, are distinguished in the table below and the election results by a number in brackets after the name. It is not suggested that such numbers were used by contemporaries of the individuals so numbered.
Elections.
The bloc vote electoral system was used in elections to fill two seats and first past the post for single member by-elections. Each voter had up to as many votes as there were seats to be filled. Votes had to be cast by a spoken declaration, in public, at the hustings (until the secret ballot was introduced in 1872).
"Note on percentage change calculations:" Where there was only one candidate of a party in successive elections, for the same number of seats, change is calculated on the party percentage vote. Where there was more than one candidate, in one or both successive elections for the same number of seats, then change is calculated on the individual percentage vote (if applicable).
The reference to some candidates as Non Partisan does not, necessarily, mean that they did not have a party allegiance. It means that the sources consulted did not specify a party allegiance.
Before the Representation of the People Act 1832, the borough had an electorate limited to its freemen. There were about 2,500 voters in the second half of the 18th century.

Julian Movchan

Julian Gregorovich Movchan ( (February 19, 1913 – January 6, 2002) was a Ukrainian-American journalist, writer and doctor.
Biography.
Born in the village of Zorokiv to a family of well-to-do peasants, in the Cherniakhiv region of what is now the Zhytomyr Oblast, his works first appeared in the local oblast newspaper "Radianska Volyn" when he was fourteen years old. Movchan moved to Zhytomyr to pursue secondary school but, due to his family's persecution as "kurkuls", left for Kharkiv, Ukraine's capital at the time where he began a new life. Escaping the ravages of the famine that engulfed most of rural Ukraine, Julian Movchan worked in a factory while editing its newspaper. At this time, he completed his education at an institute for journalism. However, disappointed with increasing censorship of the 1930s and unwilling for moral reasons to join the communist party, Movchan abandoned his career in journalism and entered medical school. When the Soviet Army occupied western Ukraine in 1939, he transferred his studies to Lviv. During the subsequent German occupation, he resumed his journalistic work, denouncing the Stalinist regime. During this time he also treated wounded soldiers of the UPA when they were smuggled into the city. When the Soviets returned, he fled westward and completed his medical studies in Munich. In 1949, he moved to America, eventually settling outside Cleveland, Ohio. He married, and had two children and four grandchildren.
After leaving Ukraine Movchan befriended Volodymyr Vynnychenko, the exiled president of Ukraine. The two had much in common: they were both eastern Ukrainian writers of humble origins with a left-wing but anti-Soviet patriotic Ukrainian political orientation. After Vynnychenko's death, Movchan was invited by his widow to move to France and serve as caretaker of Vynnychenko's archives. Movchan declined, but donated many of Vynnychenko's letters to the archives at Columbia University. Movchan continued to write until his death in January 2002.
Writings.
While maintaining a medical practice in the United States, Julian Movchan was a prolific writer, with over 1,800 published articles or letters, primarily but not exclusively in Ukrainian diaspora newspapers. Some of the many journals and newspapers that have included his articles and letters have included: the historically most important Ukrainian diaspora newspaper Svoboda Homin Ukrayiny [http://www.homin.ca/contact.php?lang=en; Narodnia Volia (newspaper of Ukrainian Social Revolutionaries); Novi Dni ; Novoye Russkoye Slovo [http://www.inforeklama.com/Partners/Newspapers/NRS/info.htm], and the The Militant. Julian Movchan primarily wrote on political and health-care related issues. He also wrote several books, including:

John Joseph of the Cross

Saint John-Joseph of the Cross (August 15, 1654 – March 5, 1739), known most commonly in the Italian language as San Giovan Giuseppe della Croce, was an Italian saint. He is the patron of Ischia, the place where he was born.
Biography.
He was born as Carlo Gaetano Calosirto on the island of Ischia, on August 15, 1654, and he entered the Franciscan Order of the Strict Observance at Naples before the age of sixteen, taking the name John Joseph of the Cross. He was the first Italian to follow the reform movement of Peter of Alcantara. He had a reputation for austerity and for the gift of miracles and was appointed Master of Novices.
In 1674 he was sent to found a friary at Afila, Piedmont, and assisted in the actual construction. He was ordained as a priest (much against his will) and as superior, performed the lowliest tasks in the monastic community.
In 1702, when the convents in Italy were no longer dependent on the Spanish houses, but were formed into a separate province, he was appointed Vicar Provincial of the Alcantarine Reform in Italy. When he was superior, he ordered that no beggar should be dismissed from the convent gate without relief: in time of scarcity he devoted to their necessities his own portion, and even that of the community. When he journeyed through Italy as provincial, he would not make himself known at the inns, where he lodged, lest any distinction should be paid him.
Not unfrequently he desired those whom he restored to health, to take some certain medicine, that the cure might be attributed to a mere natural remedy and with regard to his prophecies, which were numerous, he affected to judge from analogy and experience.
Veneration.
He was beatified in 1789, and canonized in 1839 by Pope Gregory XVI. At the Aragonese Castle (Il Castello Aragonese) on Ischia, there is a small chapel consecrated to Saint John Joseph of the Cross.

Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics, sometimes abbreviated as PK (from Ancient Greek "pharmakon" "drug" and "kinetikos" "moving, putting in motion"; see chemical kinetics), is a branch of pharmacology dedicated to determining the fate of substances administered externally to a living organism. The substances of interest include pharmaceutical agents, hormones, nutrients, and toxins. It attempts to discover the fate of a drug from the moment that it is administered up to the point at which it is completely eliminated from the body.
Pharmacokinetics describes how the body affects a specific drug after administration through the mechanisms of absorption and distribution, as well as the chemical changes of the substance in the body (e.g. by metabolic enzymes such as cytochrome P450 or glucuronosyltransferase enzymes), and the effects and routes of excretion of the metabolites of the drug. Pharmacokinetic properties of drugs may be affected by elements such as the site of administration and the dose of administered drug. These may affect the absorption rate. Pharmacokinetics is often studied in conjunction with pharmacodynamics, the study of a drug's pharmacological effect on the body.
A number of different models have been developed in order to simplify conceptualization of the many processes that take place in the interaction between an organism and a drug. One of these models, the multi-compartment model, gives the best approximation to reality; however, the complexity involved in using this type of model means that "monocompartmental models" and above all "two compartmental models" are the most-frequently used. The various compartments that the model is divided into is commonly referred to as the ADME scheme (also referred to as LADME if liberation is included as a separate step from absorption):
The two phases of metabolism and excretion can also be grouped together under the title elimination.
The study of these distinct phases involves the use and manipulation of basic concepts in order to understand the process dynamics. For this reason in order to fully comprehend the "kinetics" of a drug it is necessary to have detailed knowledge of a number of factors such as: the properties of the substances that act as excipients, the characteristics of the appropriate biological membranes and the way that substances can cross them, or the characteristics of the enzyme reactions that inactivate the drug.
All these concepts can be represented through mathematical formulas that have a corresponding graphical representation. The use of these models allows an understanding of the characteristics of a molecule, as well as how a particular drug will behave given information regarding some of its basic characteristics. Such as its acid dissociation constant (pKa), bioavailability and solubility, absorption capacity and distribution in the organism.
The model outputs for a drug can be used in industry (for example, in calculating bioequivalence when designing generic drugs) or in the clinical application of pharmacokinetic concepts. Clinical pharmacokinetics provides many performance guidelines for effective and efficient use of drugs for human-health professionals and in veterinary medicine.
Metrics.
The following are the most commonly measured pharmacokinetic metrics:
In pharmacokinetics, "steady state" refers to the situation where the overall intake of a drug is fairly in dynamic equilibrium with its elimination. In practice, it is generally considered that steady state is reached when a time of 4 to 5 times the half-life for a drug after regular dosing is started.
The following graph depicts a typical time course of drug plasma concentration and illustrates main pharmacokinetic metrics:
Pharmacokinetic models.
Pharmacokinetic modelling is performed by noncompartmental or compartmental methods. Noncompartmental methods estimate the exposure to a drug by estimating the area under the curve of a concentration-time graph. Compartmental methods estimate the concentration-time graph using kinetic models. Noncompartmental methods are often more versatile in that they do not assume any specific compartmental model and produce accurate results also acceptable for bioequivalence studies.
The final outcome of the transformations that a drug undergoes in an organism and the rules that determine this fate depend on a number of interrelated factors. A number of functional models have been developed in order to simplify the study of pharmacokinetics. These models are based on a consideration of an organism as a number of related compartments. The simplest idea is to think of an organism as only one homogenous compartment. This monocompartimental model presupposes that blood plasma concentrations of the drug are a true reflection of the drug’s concentration in other fluids or tissues and that the elimination of the drug is directly proportional to the drug’s concentration in the organism (first order kinetics).
However, these models do not always truly reflect the real situation within an organism. For example, not all body tissues have the same blood supply, so the distribution of the drug will be slower in these tissues than in others with a better blood supply. In addition, there are some tissues (such as the brain tissue) that present a real barrier to the distribution of drugs, they can be breached with greater or lesser ease depending on the drug’s characteristics. If these relative conditions for the different tissue types are considered along with the rate of elimination, the organism can be considered to be acting like two compartments: one that we can call the central compartment that has a more rapid distribution, comprising organs and systems with a well-developed blood supply; and a peripheral compartment made up of organs with a lower blood flow. Other tissues, such as the brain, can occupy a variable position depending on a drug’s ability to cross the barrier that separates the organ from the blood supply.
This two compartment model will vary depending on which compartment elimination occurs in. The most common situation is that elimination occurs in the central compartment as the liver and kidneys are organs with a good blood supply. However, in some situations it may be that elimination occurs in the peripheral compartment or even in both. This can mean that there are three possible variations in the two compartment model, which still do not cover all possibilities.
This model may not be applicable in situations where some of the enzymes responsible for metabolizing the drug become saturated, or where an active elimination mechanism is present that is independent of the drug's plasma concentration. In the real world each tissue will have its own distribution characteristics and none of them will be strictly linear. If we label the drug’s volume of distribution within the organism VdF and its volume of distribution in a tissue VdT the former will be described by an equation that takes into account all the tissues that act in different ways, that is:
formula_1
This represents the multi-compartment model with a number of curves that express complicated equations in order to obtain an overall curve. A number of computer programmes have been developed to plot these equations. However complicated and precise this model may be it still does not truly represent reality despite the effort involved in obtaining various distribution values for a drug. This is because the concept of distribution volume is a relative concept that is not a true reflection of reality. The choice of model therefore comes down to deciding which one offers the lowest margin of error for the type of drug involved.
Noncompartmental analysis.
Noncompartmental PK analysis is highly dependent on estimation of total drug exposure. Total drug exposure is most often estimated by area under the curve (AUC) methods, with the trapezoidal rule (numerical integration) the most common method. Due to the dependence on the length of 'x' in the trapezoidal rule, the area estimation is highly dependent on the blood/plasma sampling schedule. That is, the closer time points are, the closer the trapezoids reflect the actual shape of the concentration-time curve.
Compartmental analysis.
Compartmental PK analysis uses kinetic models to describe and predict the concentration-time curve. PK compartmental models are often similar to kinetic models used in other scientific disciplines such as chemical kinetics and thermodynamics. The advantage of compartmental over some noncompartmental analyses is the ability to predict the concentration at any time. The disadvantage is the difficulty in developing and validating the proper model. Compartment-free modelling based on curve stripping does not suffer this limitation. The simplest PK compartmental model is the one-compartmental PK model with IV bolus administration and first-order elimination. The most complex PK models (called PBPK models) rely on the use of physiological information to ease development and validation.
Single-compartment model.
"Linear pharmacokinetics" is so-called because the graph of the relationship between the various factors involved (( dose, blood plasma concentrations, elimination, etc.) gives a straight line or an approximation to one. For drugs to be effective they need to be able to move rapidly from blood plasma to other body fluids and tissues.
The change in concentration over time can be expressed as C=Cinitial*E^(-kelt)
Multi-compartmental models.
The graph for the non-linear relationship between the various factors is represented by a curve, the relationships between the factors can then be found by calculating the dimensions of different areas under the curve. The models used in '"non linear pharmacokinetics" are largely based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
A reaction’s factors of non linearity include the following:
It can therefore be seen that non-linearity can occur because of reasons that affect the whole of the pharmacokinetic sequence: absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination.
Bioavailability.
At a practical level, a drug’s bioavailability can be defined as the proportion of the drug that reaches its site of action. From this perspective the intravenous administration of a drug provides the greatest possible bioavailability, and this method is considered to yield a bioavailability of 1 (or 100%). Bioavailability of other delivery methods is compared with that of intravenous injection («absolute bioavailability») or to a standard value related to other delivery methods in a particular study («relative bioavailability»).
formula_2
formula_3 
Once a drug’s bioavailability has been established it is possible to calculate the changes that need to be made to its dosage in order to reach the required blood plasma levels. Bioavailability is therefore a mathematical factor for each individual drug that influences the administered dose. It is possible to calculate the amount of a drug in the blood plasma that has a real potential to bring about its effect using the formula: formula_4; where "De" is the effective dose, "B" bioavailability and "Da" the administered dose.
Therefore, if a drug has a bioavailability of 0.8 (or 80%) and it is administered in a dose of 100 mg, the equation will demonstrate the following:
That is the 100 mg administered represents a blood plasma concentration of 80 mg that has the capacity to have a pharmaceutical effect.
This concept depends on a series of factors inherent to each drug, such as:
These concepts, which are discussed in detail in their respective titled articles, can be mathematically quantified and integrated to obtain an overall mathematical equation:
where Q is the drug’s purity.
formula_6 
where formula_7 is the drug’s rate of administration and formula_8 is the rate at which the absorbed drug reaches the circulatory system.
Finally, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and knowing the drug’s formula_9 (pH at which there is an equilibrium between its ionized and non ionized molecules), it is possible to calculate the non ionized concentration of the drug and therefore the concentration that will be subject to absorption:
formula_10
When two drugs have the same bioavailability, they are said to be biological equivalents or bioequivalents. This concept of bioequivalence is important because it is currently used as a yardstick in the authorization of generic drugs in many countries .
LADME.
A number of phases occur once the drug enters into contact with the organism, these are described using the acronym LADME:
Some textbooks combine the first two phases as the drug is often administered in an active form, which means that there is no liberation phase. Others include a phase that combines distribution, metabolization and excretion into a «disposition phase». Other authors include the drug’s toxicological aspect in what is known as ADME-Tox or ADMET.
Each of the phases is subject to physico-chemical interactions between a drug and an organism, which can be expressed mathematically. Pharmacokinetics is therefore based on mathematical equations that allow the prediction of a drug’s behaviour and which place great emphasis on the relationships between drug plasma concentrations and the time elapsed since the drug’s administration.
Analysis.
Bioanalytical methods.
Mass spectrometry.
Pharmacokinetics is often studied using mass spectrometry because of the complex nature of the matrix (often plasma or urine) and the need for high sensitivity to observe concentrations after a low dose and a long time period. The most common instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank samples taken before administration are important in determining background and insuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however it is not uncommon to use curve fitting with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.
There is currently considerable interest in the use of very high sensitivity mass spectrometry for microdosing studies, which are seen as a promising alternative to animal experimentation.
Population pharmacokinetics.
"Population pharmacokinetics" is the study of the sources and correlates of variability in drug concentrations among individuals who are the target patient population receiving clinically relevant doses of a drug of interest. Certain patient demographic, pathophysiological, and therapeutical features, such as body weight, excretory and metabolic functions, and the presence of other therapies, can regularly alter dose-concentration relationships. For example, steady-state concentrations of drugs eliminated mostly by the kidney are usually greater in patients suffering from renal failure than they are in patients with normal renal function receiving the same drug dosage. Population pharmacokinetics seeks to identify the measurable pathophysiologic factors that cause changes in the dose-concentration relationship and the extent of these changes so that, if such changes are associated with clinically significant shifts in the therapeutic index, dosage can be appropriately modified.
An advantage of population pharmacokinetic modelling is its ability to analyse sparse data sets (sometimes only one concentration measurement per patient is available).
Software packages used in population pharmacokinetics modelling include NONMEM, which was developed at the UCSF and newer packages which incorporate GUIs like Monolix as well as graphical model building tools; Phoenix NLME. 
Clinical pharmacokinetics.
Clinical pharmacokinetics (arising from the clinical use of population pharmacokinetics) is the direct application to a therapeutic situation of knowledge regarding a drug’s pharmacokinetics and the characteristics of a population that a patient belongs to (or can be ascribed to).
An example is the relaunch of the use of cyclosporine as an immunosuppressor to facilitate organ transplant. The drug's therapeutic properties were initially demonstrated, but it was almost never used after it was found to cause nephrotoxicity in a number of patients. However, it was then realized that it was possible to individualize a patient’s dose of cyclosporine by analysing the patients plasmatic concentrations (pharmacokinetic monitoring). This practice has allowed this drug to be used again and has facilitated a great number of organ transplants.
Clinical monitoring is usually carried out by determination of plasma concentrations as this data is usually the easiest to obtain and the most reliable. The main reasons for determining a drug’s plasma concentration include:
Drugs where pharmacokinetic monitoring is recommended include:
Ecotoxicology.
Ecotoxicology is the study of toxic effects on a wide range of organisms and includes considerations of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics.

Antonio Trillanes IV

Antonio "Sonny" Fuentes Trillanes IV (born August 6, 1971) is a former Navy Lieutenant Senior Grade and currently serving as a senator of the Philippines since 2007.
He was born in Caloocan City.
He was known for leading the 2003 Oakwood Mutiny when he and some 300 junior officers and enlisted men of the Armed Forces of the Philippines took over the Oakwood towers in Makati City as protest for alleged rampant corruption in the Philippine government - in the Armed Forces of the Philippines in particular - and the prevalence of social injustice all over the country. He was detained for almost seven and a half years after protesting against corruption.
In the Senate election held in May 2007, Trillanes successfully launched a nationwide campaign from his prison cell as he ran and won a seat in the Philippine Senate on a shoestring budget. He was elected to the Senate as guest candidate for the anti-administration Genuine Opposition ticket, and assumed office on June 30, 2007. He made history for being the first Philippine senator to be elected while in jail when more than 11 million people voted him into office on a strong anti-corruption advocacy.
On November 29, 2007, Trillanes, together with the soldiers facing coup d'état charges in connection with the 2003 Oakwood Mutiny, marched out of the courtroom while attending a hearing towards the Peninsula Manila hotel in Makati City, to reiterate their call for the ouster of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
On December 20, 2010, he was given provisional freedom pending the recognition of the court's amnesty declaration of president Benigno Aquino III.
In October 2013, Trillanes formalized his re-election bid, filing his certificate of candidacy at the main office of the Commission on Elections in Manila. He ran under the banner of the Nacionalista Party, which is allied with the ruling Liberal Party in the 2013 midterm elections. He formed part of the umbrella coalition of the administration-backed senatorial line-up for the 2013 Philippine Senate election known as the Team PNoy.
Formally proclaimed as a Senator of the Republic in May 2013, Trillanes was re-elected by 14,127,722 Filipinos as per Comelec's official tally of votes.
Personal life.
Known as "Sonny" to his family and friends, Trillanes was born and raised in Caloocan, to Philippine Navy Capt. Antonio Floranza Trillanes, Sr. (PMA Class '59) of Ligao City, Albay, and Estelita (née Fuentes) from Ivisan, Capiz. Trillanes' other siblings are: Antonia; Antonio, Jr.; Juan Antonio ("Jay"); Antonio III ("Tiny"); and Dominic.
Trillanes is married to Arlene G. Orejana, a former member of the Philippine Military Academy corps of professors – a PMA Class 1997 graduate herself – and together they have had three children: Francis Seth; Thea Estelle; and Alan Andrew (who succumbed to illness at 21 days old).
Education.
His elementary years were spent at Siena College, Quezon City from 1975–1983, and from 1983–1987, his secondary education was at Angelicum College in Quezon City. In 1990, while a third year BS in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student from De La Salle University on Taft Avenue, Manila, he took and passed the entrance examination. He formally entered into public service the following year as a cadet in the Philippine Military Academy where he graduated "cum laude" in 1995, while earning a degree in BS Naval System Engineering. Other awards he received while in PMA are the Mathematics Plaque, Physical Science Plaque, and the Tambuli Award for electrical/electronics engineering.
In 2002, Trillanes took up his graduate studies at the University of the Philippines National College of Public Administration and Governance, and got his masters degree in Public Administration, Major in Public Policy and Program Management.
For the duration of the masters program, he received two University Scholar Awards for obtaining two semestral GPAs of 1.0 to 1.25 and a College Scholar Award for obtaining a semestral GPA of 1.25 to 1.50.
Highlights of Military Profession.
After graduating from PMA, Sonny went through all shipboard assignments starting from Mess & Supply Officer; Deck & Gunnery Officer; Engineering & Damage Control Officer; Executive Officer; and, ultimately as Acting Commanding Officer of a patrol gunboat.
During his five-year sea duty experience, his unit apprehended dozens of smugglers, illegal loggers, poachers, human smugglers and illegal fishermen in numerous maritime law enforcement operations conducted in the waters off Batanes, Ilocos, Cagayan, Isabela, Zambales, Scarborough, Quezon, Bicol, Palawan, Mindoro, Romblon, Iloilo, Cebu, Zamboanga Peninsula, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Davao and Maguindanao.
Other shore positions he held were: Administrative/Personnel Officer of Philippine Fleet Patrol Force; and Procurement Officer/Instructor, Naval Education & Training Command.
Among the highlights of his military profession, was the daring search and rescue operation for the survivors of the ill-fated M/V Princess of the Orient at the height of a super typhoon in 1998. For this act of risking their own lives in the fulfillment of their duty, Sonny and his unit managed to rescue thirty-two (32) survivors.
He was also involved in numerous naval operations in support of ground operations directed against the Abu Sayyaf and other lawless elements.
As procurement officer of the Naval Training and Education Command, Philippine Navy, Sonny reformed the procurement system, which resulted to the accumulated savings of more than four million pesos in favor of the government.
He has participated in 22 naval exercises conducted with local and foreign navies.
For his meritorious service to his country, Sonny has been awarded a total of 23 assorted merit medals, campaign ribbons and badges.
Political career.
Trillanes filed his certificate of candidacy on February 7, 2007, to run as an independent Senator even though he was detained for coup d'état. Later, he accepted an invitation from the Genuine Opposition party (GO) as one of its guest candidates to field against the Arroyo administration. He campaigned, though in jail, through the social networking site, Friendster. He was eventually proclaimed Senator-elect on June 15, 2007 by the Commission on Elections. He is the 2nd youngest senator after Benigno Aquino, Jr. elected at the age of 35 (his partymate Bam Aquino join him as youngest senator elected in 2013)
On July 23, 2007, Trillanes' motion for an "arrangement" with the Makati RTC that would allow him to fulfill his duties as a Senator while under detention, and to allow him to attend the SONA, remained unacted upon. A week after, Judge Oscar Pimentel denied Trillanes's plea to be granted leave from detention to attend Senate sessions, and to set up an office inside Fort Bonifacio in Taguig City where he had been detained. In response to Trillanes' continued imprisonment despite his election as Senator, former University of the Philippines president Francisco Nemenzo, Jr. and former vice president Teofisto Guingona, Jr. of civil society launched the ""Paglingkurin si Trillanes Trillanes Serve Movement"" in Pasay City on August 23, 2007. Akbayan Representative Risa Hontiveros, Ana Maria Nemenzo of the Freedom from Debt Coalition, opposition leader Jose Alcuaz, and Trillanes' spokesperson Sonny Rivera, were present.
Notwithstanding calls from civil society groups to allow Trillanes to serve as Senator pursuant to his election, Judge Oscar Pimentel denied Trillanes's petition to attend Senate sessions on September 20, 2007, for lack of merit, ruling that his incarceration would not be a bar to fulfilling his duties as a Senator. His petition, having been denied by the lower court, Senator Trillanes filed a petition with the Supreme Court of the Philippines, asking that his petition to be allowed to attend Senate sessions be granted. Representing him was his lawyer Reynaldo Robles. Included in said petition was a request that he be allowed to receive visitors in his jail at Fort Bonifacio.
On October 17, 2007, the Supreme Court of the Philippines, in an en banc resolution, directed the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and Makati Regional Trial Court Judge Oscar Pimentel to comment within 10 days on Senator Antonio Trillanes IV's petition. These requests were however later overshadowed by Trillanes' decision to stage another action against Gloria Arroyo's administration. On November 29, 2007, the senator led another uprising, this time at the Manila Peninsula Hotel in Makati. After walking out of his court hearing, he and Brigadier General Danilo Lim led their supporters to the hotel where they staged their protest against the government, calling on the public to join them. Six hours later, after military teams surrounded the hotel and armored personnel carriers broke through the hotel's front doors, Senator Trillanes and his companions surrendered.
In 2010, under Proclamation 75, President Benigno Aquino III granted amnesty to Trillanes and other military personnel accused of trying to oust the Arroyo administration. He was able for the first time to enter the Senate and perform his duties as a duly elected Senator.
Trillanes stood up against Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's corrupt and oppressive regime, and was incarcerated for almost 7 ½ years. As a senator, he is the 4th most productive senator in terms of the number of bills and resolutions filed, totalling to 734 bills and resolutions, 30 of which have been passed into law. He ranks 2nd both in most number of national bills sponsored and committee hearings conducted.
After formalizing his re-election bid in October 2012, Trillanes filed his certificate of candidacy for 2013 elections at the Commission on Elections main office in Manila. He is running under the banner of the Nacionalista Party, which is allied with the ruling Liberal Party in the 2013 midterm elections. Trillanes was ranked ninth out of the out of the 12 winning senators. Trillanes was proclaimed senator-elect on May 20, 2013 by the Commission on Elections with an official tally of 14,127,722 votes.
Manila Peninsula Incident.
On the morning of November 29, 2007, Trillanes, Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim, Capt. Nicanor Faeldon and other Magdalo (mutineers) officials marched out of their trial and then through the streets of Makati City, to call for the ouster of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. They then had a meeting on the second floor of The Peninsula Manila Hotel along Ayala Avenue. Former vice-president Teofisto Guingona joined the march to the Manila Peninsula Hotel, as well as some soldiers from the AFP.
3 P.M. Deadline
Thirty soldiers who stood on trial for the 2003 Oakwood Mutiny walked out of court and set up a meeting at The Peninsula Manila Hotel, where they called for the ouster of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. They had been joined by former vice-president Teofisto Guingona, who called the gathering a ""New Edsa"".
Arroyo called for an emergency Cabinet meeting as she took a chopper back to the Palace amid tight security. Novaliches Catholic Bishop Antonio Tobias, Infanta Bishop Emeritus Julio Labayen, and Fr. Robert Reyes joined the Antonio Trillanes IV group, while Exec. Sec. Eduardo Ermita and Ignacio Bunye rushed back to Malacañang. PSG sealed off the Palace, while troops secured the north and south Luzon expressways.
A website forthwith appeared, proclaiming General Lim and Senator Antonio Trillanes IV as the leaders of the incident. The website entry read: ""Senator Antonio Trillanes, Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim, Magdalo soldiers, their guards and the people have started marching towards Makati triangle. We presently find in existence a dangerous concept where the armed forces now owe their primary allegiance and loyalty to those who temporarily exercise the authority of the executive branch of the government rather than to the country and the Constitution they have sworn to protect. That is a concept we defy and struggle to eradicate. If you believe you are a man of will and courage with unselfish motives and brave enough to fight against such tyranny, rise up and be counted!""
The Philippine National Police (PNP) gave Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV and Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim until 3 pm to surrender, as it evacuated guests and personnel inside the Manila Peninsula Hotel.
The PNP general also ordered later the evacuation of the press in the hotel. Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim, stated, ""We make this fateful step of removing Mrs. Macapagal-Arroyo from the presidency and undertake the formation of a new government"."
Security forces were scheduled to arrest members of the group at exactly 3 pm. Judge Oscar Pimentel, Makati Regional Trial Court, issued the arrest order, and Director Geary Barias, National Capital Region Police Office director, stated: ""Arrests will be made at 3 pm""
After 3 pm, police director Geary Barias of the National Capital Region Police Office left The Peninsula Manila Hotel, since he was asked to leave by troops supportive of Trillanes. Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV dismissed the PNP 3 pm deadline, saying, "Believe me, nothing will happen after three o'clock."
At least 50 Special Weapons and Tactics commandos lined up outside to assault the Manila Peninsula Hotel in Makati City to enforce the arrest of rebel soldiers. Sporadic warning shots were heard from the police outside the hotel, as smoke was seen coming from the hotel seconds after the shots. (4:01 pm) The Palace asked reporters to move out of the hotel, as armored personnel carriers arrived. Hundreds of guests scrambled to vacate, and Trillanes said they will 'wait and see'[?] Bishop Julio Labayen appealed: "Please do not storm the place, so nobody gets hurt." (4:37 pm)
Firing stopped at 4:30 pm GMA crew, and other media personnel were trapped in the hotel, while the Palace appealed to the media and the public to stay away from Makati. Tear gas was fired into the hotel lobby as government troops advanced. Soldiers surrounded the hotel at 5 pm).
The armored tank then destroyed the main facade of the Manila Peninsula Hotel to allow the troops to enter.
Chief Justice Reynato Puno, who had just arrived from Guam, stated that he would not head a caretaker government if President Arroyo was removed from power, for he wants to insulate the judiciary from politics. Prominent businessmen denounced Trillanes and Lim.
Compromise.
Senator Antonio Trillanes IV and Brigadier General Danilo Lim decided to compromise to arresting authorities to avoid loss of civilian lives inside the hotel. Police Director Geary Barias declared that the standoff at the Manila Peninsula Hotel was over as Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim, along with other junior officers, agreed to leave the hotel and surrender to Barias after the six-hour siege.
Aftermath.
Trillanes and Lim were placed under maximum security in Camp Crame. Anti-Arroyo rallyists marched towards Liwasang Bonifacio. Julio Labayen, bishop-prelate emeritus of Infanta, was transferred from detention in Camp Crame to the custody of the current Infanta bishop-prelate, Rolando Tria Tirona, and/or the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). "Manila Pen '50'" or the personalities arrested were transferred from the Camp Bagong Diwa in Bicutan to the maximum detention cell in Camp Crame, while 11 ABS-CBN personnel were released after processing. 450 people were arrested in Metro Manila due to the curfew enforced in the metropolis and in Regions III and IV.
Novaliches Bishop Antonio Tobias, Caloocan Bishop Deogracias Iniguez, Jr. and Infanta, Quezon Bishop Emeritus Julio Labayen, all of Kilusang Makabansang Ekonomiya (KME) – lead a prayer rally at Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, Bonifacio Day, and asked Mrs. Arroyo to step down for ""lack of moral ascendancy to lead the nation"." Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) held its rally at nearby Bonifacio Shrine in Lawton led by former Vice President Teofisto Guingona, Jr.. As of 1:30 pm, some 5,000 members of militant groups gathered at España Avenue to march towards Liwasang Bonifacio. At 11 am, ""reserve force"" / troops with 10 6 × 6 military trucks came from Fort Magsaysay in Palayan City, Nueva Ecija and passed along EDSA towards Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City. Some personalities / detainees arrested, accused the police of ""maltreating"" them during their detention in Camp Bagong Diwa. Lawyer Argee Guevarra stated that retired bishop Julio Labayen was ""treated like a common criminal"", handcuffed and fingerprinted during detention: ""Bishop Labayen was never imprisoned during Martial Law. But under the rule of Arroyo and Pidal, no less than a bishop was arrested and detained"." Australia and the UK cautioned nationals in Manila. The Manila Peninsula Hotel re-opened on December 3, after assessment of damages.
On December 1, 2007, the Philippine National Police (PNP) formed a team to re-arrest Nicanor Faeldon, while former University of the Philippines president Francisco Nemenzo was freed to the custody of Akbayan Rep. Ana Theresia "Risa" Hontiveros as inquest proceedings continued against Senator Antonio Trillanes IV and 49 others at the Camp Crame Multipurpose Hall who were accused of Rebellion. DOJ Undersecretary Fidel Esconde, state prosecutors Aristotle Reyes, Philip dela Cruz and Alvin Navarro were part of the inquest panel. Inquest proceedings ended at 1:00 am, and Senior State Prosecutor Emmanuel Velasco said the resolution will be released on December 3: ""Until we issue a resolution, those arrested will stay in detention or under the police custody; We will make a resolution as soon as possible. We also do not want to prolong the agony of the complaint respondents"." Velasco, also stated on "Peninsula 50": "We are working fast to avoid prolonging the agony of the respondents. We want to see to it that if they are innocent, they can be released immediately. If they are liable, we want to assure them this is just work and there is nothing personal. There was no media personality charged. And from what I have observed so far, media did not do anything wrong during the standoff." The Central Command (CENTCOM) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines remained under red alert as CENTCOM chief Maj. Gen. Victor Ibrado conducted a loyalty check among his personnel. Francisco Nemenzo, Jr. confirmed that a police general hit Senator Antonio Trillanes IV: "My civilian companions and I were not hurt. I didn’t hear any report that the civilians were hurt. But the soldiers were roughed up, especially Senator Trillanes]. I saw that a police general punched Trillanes, and then his handcuff was tightened. It appeared that they wanted to humiliate him, they dragged him by holding his belt." Meanwhile, opposition senators blocked a resolution of Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago to expel Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV from the Senate of the Philippines. Also, Philippine National Police chief Director General Avelino Razon, Jr. affirmed that it will counter media networks (ABS-CBN) suits against the PNP who also denied an allegation of a lawyer of junior officers that Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim and their companions were manhandled at a police camp. Teofisto Guingona, Jr. returned to Crame to visit detained daughter, and actress-writer Bibeth Orteza was released from Camp Crame. The Bishops’ rally fizzled out, while elsewhere, loyal troops choked off support for Trillanes. 602 curfew violators were held in Central Luzon, while 479 were arrested in Calabarzon during curfew. Further, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's luncheon with Pampanga journalists was cancelled but she kept her Europe itinerary despite ouster attempt.
Avelino Razon, Jr., chief of the PNP and the Armed Forces stated that Makati police, 32 personalities and government employee were probed for siege involvement, and also announced set talks with media / the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP) on December 5:"We're going to have a talk with the AFP and KBP to discuss the problem so what happened will not be repeated."
On December 3, 2007, Antonio Trillanes IV asked Miriam Defensor Santiago to reconsider her expulsion Senate Resolution 228 (citing Rule 34, Sec. 97 of the Senate Rules / Art. II, Sec. 3 of the 1987 Constitution). But Senate President Manuel Villar, Jr. stated: "Kailangan 2/3 or 16 votes papunta sa explusion (You need 2/3 or 16 votes for expulsion)." The Department of Justice (DOJ), 10-page resolution, filed Rebellion charges against Teofisto Guingona, Jr., Bishop Emeritus Julio Labayen, Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, Army Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim, "running" priest Robert Reyes and 31 other individuals. It also issued a hold departure order against the 36 individuals, while 15 others released underwent preliminary investigation. Thus, the Senate of the Philippines held caucus on the arrests of media men, curfew and expulsion resolution, as Manuel Roxas II filed resolution for inquiry on the treatment of journalists. The Peninsula Manila declared itself "fully operational" at noon. Sanlakas militants stormed the PNP headquarters, Quezon City (10:30 am in front of the Camp Crame main gate along EDSA) to call for the release from detention of their leaders. The Armed Forces National Capital Region Command (NCRCom), fact finding board, uncovered lapses by 100 soldiers but no Mutiny by Magdalo guards. Natividad Reyes / the family of activist priest Robert Reyes appealed to Gaudencio Rosales. With situation ‘normalized,’ Hermogenes Esperon left for Malaysia. 14 arrested civilians were released by the Philippine National Police from the PNP Custodial Center in Camp Crame past 7 pm: businessman Herman Tiu Laurel, Stella Guingona, daughter of former vice-president Teofisto Guingona, El Cid Fajardo, Leonido Toledo, Evangeline Mendoza, Jose Albert, Eduardo Castro, Ferdinand Sandoval, Julie Ancheta, Maamor Lanto, Romeo Dacles, Ryan Custodio, Edgardo Viania and Ray Linaac.
On December 6, 2007, the Rebellion and inciting to rebellion case were raffled to high-profile Judge Elmo Alameda of Makati Regional Trial Court Branch 150. He handled the rebellion case against the "Batasan 6", lawmakers, and the murder case against former Batangas governor Jose Antonio Leviste. DILG Secretary Ronaldo Puno stated that defiant media can be arrested again, while Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. and Sen. Panfilo Lacson visited Antonio Trillanes IV to check on his living conditions. Pimentel told Trillanes to ‘Stay out of trouble.’ The NBI asked The Peninsula Manila for Nov 29 CCTV footages. ABS-CBN news executives assailed government officials for the arrest and cuffing of members of the media, in the Hotel dialogue. DOJ deferred motion to transfer Trillanes, Lim to New Bilibid Prisons, as Muntinlupa Representative Rozzano Rufino Biazon, an administration ally, and Deputy Minority Leader Roilo Golez opposed: "The Bilibid is an institution of convicts and Trillanes et al. are not convicts. Their detention in NBP will be irregular. It seems to be punishment while still undergoing trial." Bishop Emeritus Julio Labayen of Infanta, Quezon, returned to Quezon province (Infanta with Bishop Rolando Tirona).
In a 48-page comment filed November 28, Solicitor General Agnes Devanadera blocked Trillanes's plea for Senate attendance. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo stated that the government would show no mercy to Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV and the rebel soldiers and civilians. "You saw it on television. It's clear that the actions of these few desperate men reveal just how out of touch they are with the hopes and dreams of the average Filipino."
On December 13, 2007, the Makati court dismissed rebellion cases against Teofisto Guingona, Jr., Fr. Robert Reyes, Bishop Emeritus Julio Labayen, Francisco Nemenzo, Elizabeth Orteza, lawyers JV Bautista and Argee Guevarra and other civilians. Journalists (Malaya columnist Ellen Tordesillas, NHK reporter Charmaine Deosgracias and Maria Ressa of ABS-CBN) recounted their ordeals during the Manila siege at the Senate hearing on media arrest. Recently, 6 unidentified soldiers were probed over the siege and Antonio Trillanes also filed a manifestation apologizing to Makati Regional Trial Court Judge Oscar Pimentel, from whose courtroom the walkout began. The apology however, as Sen. Trillanes pointed out, was not directed at Mrs. Arroyo.
On December 28, 2007, Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV and 16 accused by counsel Ernesto Francisco, in the November 29 Makati Rebellion, moved for partial reconsideration of the probable cause Order dated December 13, 2007, and to dismiss the case pending at the sala of Judge Elmo Alameda, Makati Regional Trial Court Branch 50.
The Supreme Court of the Philippines, on June 27, 2008, per ponente Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales in a 16-page decision unanimously dismissed Trillanes' petition "to be allowed to attend Senate sessions, other plenary or committee hearings, to give interviews to air his comments to the press, to attend to his official functions and duties and to receive members of his staff at the Marine brig in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig." Morales ruled: "All prisoners whether under preventive detention or serving final sentence cannot practice their profession nor engage in any business or occupation, or hold office, elective or appointive, while in detention; the fact that he is on trial for a non-bailable offense makes his rights more limited than those of the public; the 'Manila Pen Incident,' proves that petitioner's argument bites the dust. The risk that he would escape ceased to be neither remote nor nil, as in fact, the cause for foreboding became real; election, or more precisely, reelection to office does not obliterate a criminal charge; The Petitioner's electoral victory only signifies pertinently that when the voters elected him to the Senate, they did so with full awareness of the limitations on his freedom of action and with the knowledge that he could only achieve such legislative results which he could accomplish within the confines of prison."

Red Laser

Red Laser is an Action Force action figure and comic book character. He is a Red Shadow and the gunner of the Laser Exterminator.
Red Laser was known in West Germany as Roter Laser.
Characterisation.
According to his "Battle Action Force" depiction, Red Laser is a former-member of a Japanese terrorist organisation and:
"Has a high level of technical experience. Formerly a student of Laser Technology at Tokyo University, was corrupted by dreams of power shown to him by Baron Ironblood. Has developed Laser Exterminator into the most deadly weapon in the enemy armoury."
In addition, Red Laser is described as "totally corrupt", and "brainwashed by Baron Ironblood to accept the slightest command from him" 
Action figure.
As an action figure Red Laser was supplied with a black pistol which could be clipped onto his back. The figure distributed in Europe is a repaint of the Cobra Commander. A variation of the figure, without the skull and crossbones, was made for West Germany due to then German toy laws.
Role in the transition to Cobra.
Red Laser is one of a handful of Red Shadow characters incorporated into the storyline that accompanied the transition to Cobra in the mid-1980s. The change in direction saw a storyline where Ironblood betrays the Red Shadows, leaking information about their bases and intentions to the UN. As the Shadows are wiped out, Ironblood goes into hiding and constructs a new identity for himself, becoming Cobra Commander, and creating Cobra as a new enemy force.
Subsequently, Red Laser (who is shown without his face mask/helmet) together with the Black Major and Red Vulture goes in search of Ironblood to seek revenge for the betrayal of the Red Shadows. However he is unable to get near to his former leader and exits the series having rescued the Black Major with Red Vulture. He never features again in "Battle Action Force".

Grothman graduated from Homestead High School in Mequon, and attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison for his undergraduate degree. In 1983, he received his law degree from the University of Wisconsin Law School.
Wisconsin legislature.
Grothman was elected to the 58th Assembly District in a special election held in December 1993. From 1999 to 2004, he was the Assembly Majority Caucus Vice Chairperson. In 2004, he challenged State Senate Majority Leader Mary Panzer in the Republican primary. He ran well to Panzer's right, charging that she was insufficiently conservative. He won the nomination in a rout, taking 79 percent of the vote to Panzer's 21 percent. He was unopposed in the general election for this heavily Republican district. From 2007 to 2008, he was the Senate Minority Caucus Chairperson. He has been the assistant Republican leader since 2009, serving as assistant minority leader from 2009 to 2010 and as assistant majority leader since 2011. Grothman is a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council.
As of 2009, Grothman was the only Republican Wisconsin Senator with a law degree.
Political positions.
Concealed carry.
An advocate of Second Amendment rights, Grothman is a long-time supporter of concealed carry legislation, but does not advocate allowing concealed weapons in taverns. He believes concealed carry laws would deter criminal behavior, with permits being awarded to law-abiding citizens who pass a gun safety course.
Grothman co-introduced 2011 SB 93, which was signed into law by Governor Scott Walker This bill made Wisconsin the 49th state to legalize concealed carry.
Equal pay.
Speaking in support of Governor Scott Walker's decision to repeal the Wisconsin Equal Pay Act, Grothman stated that the alleged pay differential is explainable: "Once you break it down by married and unmarried, the differential disappears." 
State Rep. Christine Sinicki accused Grothman of believing "that women belonged at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies." Politifact rated that accusation as False.
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.
Grothman has argued that Martin Luther King, Jr. Day should not be a state employee holiday, calling the day off "an insult to all the other taxpayers around the state". He has expressed doubts that "state workers would be 'checking out DVDs or reading books' about King and would probably just be out shopping or watching television instead."
He released a statement opposing a Kwanzaa holiday, stating that we should "treat Kwanzaa with the
contempt it deserves before it becomes a permanent part of our culture." Kwanzaa was created in 1966 as an "oppositional alternative" to Christmas.
Municipal water chlorination.
He was a co-sponsor of Senate Bill 19 (2011), which removes the requirement of mandatory chlorination of groundwater in municipal water systems. This bill was supported by the League of Wisconsin Municipalities which argued that it was unnecessary and expensive.
Raw milk.
Grothman is a vocal supporter of decriminalizing Raw milk sales.
Sex education.
He opposed a provision in a 2010 sex education law that prohibited teachers from promoting bias based on sexual orientation, saying that he did not believe the topic should be discussed at all in the public schools. According to the "Capitol Times", Grothman's opposition was based on "the belief that instructors who lead these talks would have what he called an "agenda" to persuade students to become gay." Grothman believes the kindergarten program for 4-year-olds should be defunded by Governor Scott Walker because any academic benefits disappear by the fourth grade, and the program is used by school districts to pad their budgets to get more state aid.
Single parenthood.
In February 2012, Grothman introduced Senate Bill 507, which would amend Wisconsin statutes to emphasize single parenthood as a contributing factor to child abuse and neglect. Politifact investigated his claim that kids living with a parent and parent's partner are "20 times" more likely to be sexually abused, and rated it True.
He also sponsored State Bill 202, which would have repealed the Equal Pay Enforcement Act, saying that the "Left and the social welfare establishment want children born out of wedlock because they are far more likely to be dependent on the government."
Smoking.
Grothman opposed a bill that would increase funding for anti-smoking programs from $10 to $30 million. He believes that anti-smoking campaigns do not work, and are no longer necessary, writing "Everybody knows you're not supposed to smoke!." He also voted against the ban on smoking in bars, restaurants and other small business that became effective in July 2010. After the bill was passed, he introduced new legislation to allow guests to smoke in hotel rooms.. He also co-sponsored a bill to exempt electronic cigarettes from the smoking ban.
Welfare Reform.
In June 2013, Grothman advocated for reforming welfare in Wisconsin. He advocated requiring nondisabled single adults to either work twenty hours per week, or attend twenty hours of job training per week to continue receiving FoodShare benefits.
2011 Wisconsin budget protests.
Grothman has been a vocal proponent of SB11, a controversial bill proposed by Governor Scott Walker in early 2011. He has said he supports the so-called budget repair bill because it is fiscally responsible. In a recent press interview, he said that he did not "find it impressive" that over 70,000 protesters marched on the capitol.
During the protests, Grothman was cornered by almost 200 pro-union protesters yelling "Shame! Shame!" outside the state capitol building. Grothman said he was not concerned about violence at the time, adding that, "They're loud, they'll give you the finger, and they yell at you, but I really think deep down inside they're just mostly college kids having fun, just like they're having fun sleeping with their girlfriends on air mattresses. That's the guts of that crowd." He also described the protesters as "a different breed of person" and "a bunch of slobs taking up the building."
During this time, Grothman also advocated the hiring of more business-friendly individuals to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. In doing so, he went out of his way to single out one of the University of Wisconsin campuses as a target: "Maybe you (should) look to hire those people who know what the real world is like, rather than a recent graduate from UW-Stevens Point who doesn't know what the real world is like." This was only days before appearing at UW—Stevens Point with the Joint Finance Committee for a day of hearings on Scott Walker's budget bill.
Grothman was subject to a recall effort in the spring of 2011, but the effort failed, collecting only 75% of the required signatures. During the recall, Grothman supporters gathered hundreds of signatures for a giant "Thank You" card for Grothman.
2014 Congressional campaign.
On April 3, 2014; Grothman announced he would run in that year's Republican primary for against 17-term incumbent Tom Petri. He is running well to Petri's right; in his campaign announcement he called Petri a "decent, genial person" who lacked the "sense of urgency" to put more curbs on "a federal government that seems to be out of control." Grothman moved from the 5th District, represented by fellow Republican Jim Sensenbrenner, to the 6th district in 2014. However, his state senate district includes much of the southeastern portion of the 6th congressional district. Grothman will not have to give up his state senate seat to run for Congress; Wisconsin state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and he is not up for reelection until 2016.
Personal life.
Grothman has never been married and has no children.

Crinivirus

Crinivirus is a genus of plant viruses that belong to the family "Closteroviridae". They are also known as the lettuce infectious yellows virus group. They are linear, single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses (and are therefore group IV).
Examples of species whose entire genomes have been sequenced that are currently classified into the genus include the Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and the Lettuce infectious yellows virus (LIYV).
Virus particle structure.
The Universal Virus Database describes that the virions of the genus each consists of a non-enveloped, filamentous capsid "with a length of 1200–2000 nm and a width of 10-13 nm". The capsid is also described to have "helical symmetry".
Genetics.
The viruses of this genus have segmented, bipartite genomes that add up to 7,500–19,500 nucleotides in length. Their genomes also code for proteins that do not form part of the virion particles as well as structural proteins. The Universal Virus Database describes that their genome sequences near their 3'-ends are capable of hairpin-loop formation and also believe that their 5'-ends may have methylated caps. Each of the viral RNA molecules contains four hair-pin structures and a pseudoknot in the 3'UTR. The pseudoknot is unusual in that it contains a small stem-loop structure inside loop L1. In the related genus Closterovirus, these secondary structures have been found to be important in viral RNA replication.

Libertà condizionata

Article 176 of the Italian Criminal Code concerns libertà condizionata (English: conditional release, or parole.)
According to the provisions of Article 176, an incarcerated person becomes eligible for a grant of "libertà condizionata" if he or she satisfies at least the following conditions:
(1) The prisoner has spent more than thirty months in confinement, or in the case of someone subject to a life sentence, at least 26 years;
(2) The prisoner has served more than half of their sentence, or if the inmate has served another sentence for another crime in the past, he has served three-quarters of that sentence;
(3) The prisoner has less than five years remaining on a sentence between 7½ years and life.
Once eligible for consideration, a prisoner must also be certified, based on his conduct in prison, as unlikely to commit another crime; otherwise, "libertà condizionata" need not be granted.
In addition, the tribunale di sorveglianza (English: "surveillance court") may impose conditions on the ex-convict's release. Typical conditions are that he must be at home during night-time hours or live in a certain municipality (Italian: comune) and not leave without explicit court permission.
If someone released under "libertà condizionata" commits a crime, he will be remanded to custody and serve the full term of the original sentence, in addition to any new penalty. Also, if he violates the conditions imposed by the "tribunale di sorveglianza", he may be returned to prison. A person who behaves satisfactorily under "libertà condizionata" for a period of five years is considered to have paid his debt to society.
A person sentenced for a crime related to the mafia or terrorism is ineligible for "libertà condizionata" unless he cooperates with the authorities, but some critics argue that it's hard to know what evidence might support the assertion that ties of this sort have, in fact, been broken. Becoming a pentito and giving substantial help to the authorities is generally considered to be sufficient evidence of a change of heart.
Of the approximately fifty thousand inmates in Italian prisons, only twenty-one were granted "libertà condizionata" in 2006. It is much more common to be allowed to work outside the prison during the day ("semilibertà", i.e. semi-freedom).

Pronatura Noreste

Pronatura Noreste is a Mexican nongovernmental, nonprofit organization recognized by the National Council of Science and Technology as a scientific and educational organization. Pronatura Noreste is one of six regional offices of the Pronatura family, and has its headquarters in Monterrey, Nuevo León. It also has offices in Matamoros, Tamaulipas; Cuatro Ciénegas, Coahuila; San Rafael, Nuevo León; Janos, Chihuahua; and Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas. 
The organization was created in 1998 by an Executive Board of Trustees committed to nature conservation. 
Its mission is the conservation of flora, fauna and priority ecosystems of northeastern Mexico by promoting society’s development in harmony with nature. 
Conservation approach.
Pronatura Noreste's projects are based on an ecoregional focus, expanding over the territorial limits determined by states and countries, with special attention on priority sites and the most fragile habitats, species and biodiversity. Its four ecoregional programs are:
The environmental organization currently has conservation projects in the states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, Coahuila, Chihuahua and San Luis Potosí.
Pronatura Noreste owns three private reserves. The first property it acquired was Pozas Azules Private Reserve, in Cuatro Ciénegas, Coahuila. Inside the property are 35% of the valley's pools. The organization has restored wetlands, protected species such as stromatolites, and does community work in the region. In 2005, Pronatura Noreste became owner of a ranch in Janos, Chihuahua. The grasslands of El Uno Private Reserve have recovered ever since, and Pronatura is promoting the legal protection of the region of Janos. In 2006, it purchased Cueva de la Boca, a cave near Monterrey that is home to a large population of Mexican free-tailed bats. This northeastern Mexican environmental conservation organization uses other legal tools to protect land in addition to outright purchase, such as conservation easements and the acquisition of water rights.
Some of the flagship species protected by Pronatura Noreste are the Mexican prairie dog, black-tailed prairie dog, American black bear, piping plover, long-billed curlew, maroon-fronted parrot, thick-billed parrot, and ocelot.
Funding.
Pronatura Noreste's projects receives financial funding from organizations such as CONABIO, the Dallas Zoo, the Environmental Defense Fund, Ford Motor Company, Fondo Mexicano para la Conservación de la Naturaleza, General Motors, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the World Wide Fund for Nature, The Nature Conservancy, Treviño Elizondo A.B.P., the United States Agency for International Development and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as some Mexican corporate industrial groups, such as CEMEX and ALFA. It also has a number of individual donors, both Mexican and foreign.

List of S.H.E covers and parodies

S.H.E is a Taiwanese girl group that specializes in pop music, and is also known to have covered many songs during their musical career. Of the 90 songs the group has sung, 28 of those are covers. Occasionally, S.H.E samples music from other works, including classical and folk pieces.
In earlier S.H.E albums, nearly half of the tracks were cover songs; however, as the group's career progressed, cover songs were produced less frequently. This trend continued until the release of "FM S.H.E" (2008), which had four covers, the most in an S.H.E album since 2002. Although Sweetbox's "Chyna Girl" and "More Than Love" are more widespread in the Western world, they were, in fact, preceded by "Super Star" and "I Love You," respectively. HIM International Music hired Geo for both works. Among the artists whose songs were covered by S.H.E, Sweetbox has been covered most frequently, leading the way with four songs.__FORCETOC__

Quigley Catholic High School

Quigley Catholic High School is located in Baden, Pennsylvania. It is the only Roman Catholic high school in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. The school opened in 1967 and is named for Monsignor Thomas J. Quigley.
History.
School History.
In 1902 the Sisters of St. Joseph opened an academy for boys. At the suggestion of Bishop Hugh C. Boyle they opened the Mt. Gallitzin High School for Girls in September 1934. The first class graduated in 1938, the centennial year of Baden Township. The school offered both academic and commercial courses and touted its broad cultural program and the individual attention and direction given to each student. Most of the girls were commuters, save some boarders who were preparing to the Congregation of the Sisters. Once Quigley Catholic opened its doors in 1967 the school was forced to consolidate. At the time of the consolidation in 1967, the student enrollment was 245. There was one other school that consolidated to Quigley Catholic, St. Veronica’s.
St. Veronica High School was opened in September 1924, under the supervision of Fr. John Martin, pastor, and the Sisters of St. Joseph who staffed the new parish high school. Seventeen students were in the first graduating class. Growth continued so quickly that within 15 years new space was desperately needed. Rev. James O’Connell and Rev. Paul Nee continued the education expansion at St. Veronica’s. A building at 5th and Beaver Road was obtained through cooperation from the Ambridge School board in 1945. When a new school for elementary level students was built in 1959, the high school eventually moved back to its original home on Melrose Avenue. At the time of the consolidation in 1967 the enrollment of 243 included students from many other parishes besides St. Veronica.
In the mid-1960s the Superintendent of Schools for the Diocese of Pittsburgh was Auxiliary Bishop, Most Reverend John B. McDowell. At that time he and Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, John J. Wright saw a need for expanding the Diocesan presence in a regional Catholic high school to serve the people of the Beaver Valley.
In 1966, under the supervision of Bishop McDowell, land was purchased from the Sisters of St. Joseph and ground was broken. Quigley Catholic High School first opened its doors to students in September 1967. The 440 students came to the new school while construction of the building was still being finished around them. The formal dedication and blessing of the building took place on April 28, 1968. The school opened under the leadership of Father Robert J. Reardon as Headmaster and with the guidance of Sister St. Bede Downey, CSJ, who continued to serve Quigley Catholic for many years until her death. Additional principals have been Rev. George Leech, John S. Hoehl, Sr. Anna Marie Gaglia, CSJ, Rev. Ronald R. Cellini, Rev. David C. Menegay, Dr. Madonna Helbling and current principal Mrs. Rita McCormick. Growth and construction of one sort or another has been going on ever since. Quigley Catholic is the first and only regional Catholic high school in Beaver County.
About the Namesake of Quigley.
MONSIGNOR THOMAS J. QUIGLEY: 1905-1960
superintendent of schools for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh until his death in 1960
“…This new school has been named in honor of the late and beloved Monsignor Thomas J. Quigley, who was Superintendent of Schools from August 1939 to December 1955. This extraordinary priest served the diocese, its schools, and the general community as a spiritual leader and an accomplished educator from 1931 until his untimely death in 1960. No man gave so much to education or to the Church as did he. In every area of education he was outstanding. Readily recognized as a leader by public and non-public educators, this priest contributed, in an extraordinary way, to the development of education for all children and for all segments of our community. It is significant that the priests of Beaver County voted by an overwhelming majority to dedicate this school in his memory. In this way they hoped to memorialize and to express appreciation for a life spent in improving both the city of God and the city of humankind. Dedicated priest, scholarly educator, prolific writer, able administrator, but most of all a man committed to a cause – this was Monsignor Quigley. And while we honor his memory by naming this school after him, we do, in fact, honor this school by using his name and identifying it with all that is good in education and community life.” Auxiliary Bishop, Most Reverend John B. McDowell (then, Superintendent of Schools) April 1968 from the Dedication of Quigley Catholic High School.
Academics.
Quigley Catholic has been named as a top 50 Catholic High School in America for six consecutive years.

Where the unknown future lies
Steep the path but great the prize.
So shall we with heart and soul
Ever seek the highest goal
With the help of God to be
Nobly wise and strongly free
With the help of God to be
Alma Mater Quigley High!
Controversy.
(Fr.) John "Jack" S. Hoehl was school principal from 1971 to 1985. Hoehl (a priest at the time) was accused, by at least 7 men in 2001, of sexual abuse while they were students at Quigley Catholic High School during Hoehl's tenure as principal there. The men claim they were invited to the rectory for, "wrestling team sleep overs" where they were allowed to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana. While they were incapacitated Hoehl sexually abused them. One former Quigley Catholic student claims the abuse continued for four years. The lawsuits have been dropped because the statute of limitations has run out. However, Hoehl was permanently banned from ministry in 1988 by then Bishop, Donald Wuerl, because Wuerl considered the accusations to be credible. On June 16, 2004 the Vatican severed all ties with Heohl. There is no proof that other staff members were involved with or had knowledge of the alleged abuse.
Hoehl went on to become a youth counselor in West Virginia. He was subsequently removed from this post by the West Virginia Board of Counselors because of the credible accusations of sexual abuse from former students at Quigley Catholic High School.

Taxandria (film)

Taxandria (1994) is a partially animated fantasy film by Raoul Servais, based on a book by French writer Alain Robbe-Grillet, and starring, among others, Armin Mueller-Stahl. Being Servais's first and to date only feature film, "Taxandria" is notable for the use of Servais's distinct animation style, the "servaisgraphie", as well as its connection to the Belgian graphic novel series "Les Cités Obscures" whose creator François Schuiten was the film's production designer.
Plot.
Young prince Jan has been sent to a quiet coastal resort to study for his final exams, but instead he spends most of his time with his new friend, the lighthouse keeper. Jan ignores the warnings of the locals who claim that the loony lighthouse man (Armin Mueller-Stahl) eats seagulls for breakfast. Maybe the lighthouse keeper is crazy, but this does not prevent him from introducing prince Jan to the dreamland Taxandria, a phantasmagorical place devoid of time, memory, and progress. Jan learns that a reason for the lighthouse keeper's notoriety among the locals is that from time to time he hides political refugees from Taxandria from the authorities; in one scene, we see some of these fugitives arrive at the coast in a boat and taken in by the lighthouse keeper. It is however never made clear whether Taxandria really exists or if the viewer only sees what the lighthouse keeper relates to prince Jan, although once Jan is transported to Taxandria simply by looking into the lighthouse's rotating light while the keeper is away.
As a failed scientific experiment in the past accidentally removed Taxandria from its home planet (a disaster now recalled by the citizens of Taxandria as the "Great Cataclysm"), all science, progress, and measure of time are outlawed as a consequence, whereas the "Perennial Present" reigns supreme. The land is ruled by two conjoined princes, always hidden behind a curtain, and their police force who insure that everyone there lives in the Perennial Present, as it is illegal to discuss the past or future. The police is headed by this world's evil counterpart of the benevolent lighthouse keeper (a double role for actor Armin Mueller-Stahl), communicating the will and orders of the mute Two Princes, making him the effective ruler of Taxandria.
While at first Taxandria seems a magical, wonderful place, Jan soon sees the darker side of this strange world. The people are not happy living only in the present; it is repressive. Soon he sees that many suffer from extreme paranoia. Aimé (Elliott Spiers), the son of the evil Head of Police, seems to be a catalyst for change in Taxandria, as he is obsessed with making new inventions and learning about the country's past. Later, Aimé falls in love with Princess Ailée who is trying to free herself from the paradisaical confines of the Garden of Mirth, where women are kept away from men, and discovers the secret of his father that made him Taxandria's effective ruler while being the Head of Police, as well as the true nature of the Two Princes.
Filming and release.
Taxandria was filmed in Budapest in 1989. before the film's release. Taxandria was premiered at the 1994 Flanders Film Festival and was dedicated to his memory.
"Taxandria" and "Les Cités Obscures".
Benoît Peeters, co-creator of the Belgian graphic novel series "Les Cités Obscures", had collaborated with Servais before on a documentary entitled "Servaisgraphia" on Servais's unique animation style that was released in 1992.
With François Schuiten as the film's production designer, "Taxandria" exhibits a loose connection with "Les Cités Obscures" by Schuiten and Peeters. In the "Obscure Cities" series, at times characters refer to the vanished city-state of Taxandria which was accidentally removed from the planet during a failed scientific experiment, an event also related in the movie "Taxandria". A common theme in steampunk-influenced "Les Cités Obscures", Taxandrian clothing and technology appear to resemble Victorian times on our earth, Taxandria's architecture is reminiscent of Schuiten's trademark phantasmagorical architectural fantasies, and another feature the film shares with "Les Cités Obscures" is a bloated absurd, Kafkaesque bureaucracy.
A reinterpreting graphic novel adaptation of the movie "Taxandria" was published by Schuiten and Peeters one year prior to the film's official release under the title "Souvenirs de l'Eternel Présent: Variation sur le Film "Taxandria" de Raoul Servais" (Arboris, 1993, ISBN 90-344-1011-0, ISBN 978-90-344-1011-5), also including production background informations on the film.
Awards.
"Taxandria" won the 1996 Best Film Award at the Franco-Belgian Fantafestival, the Diploma of Merit at the 4th Kecskemét Animation Film Festival, the Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Silver, the International Fantasy Film Award, and the International Fantasy Film Special Jury Award at the 1996 Fantasporto festival. It was nominated for the 1996 Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Gold at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film, the 1996 Golden Frog Award at the Camerimage festival, and the International Fantasy Film Award at the 1996 Fantasporto festival.

Andrew Gee

Andrew Gee (born 23 April 1970 in Queensland) is an Australian rugby league administrator and the current football operations manager at the Brisbane Broncos of the NRL. A former player with the club, he was a Queensland State of Origin representative prop forward, and at the time of his retirement, held the Broncos' club record for most appearances of any forward.
Playing career.
While attending Beaudesert High School, Gee played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1986. 
He transferred to Brisbane from Beaudesert, Queensland in 1989 and started his representative career for Queensland the following year.
Gee was rewarded after his strong display in the 1991 State of Origin series with selection on the Australian tour of Papua New Guinea. Unfortunately, he made just one appearance before being injured and also met a similar fate the following season.
The Brisbane forward played just seven matches and was left out of the starting line up that defeated St George Dragons 28-8 in the 1992 NSWRL Grand Final. In the weeks following the grand final Gee traveled with the Broncos to England, where he played at prop forward in the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan, helping Brisbane become the first Australian club to win the World Club Challenge in Britain.
Gee was a reserve when the club won the second of its two consecutive premierships in 1993 but overcame a lengthy suspension at the beginning of the 1994 season to take his place in the side that lost the 1994 World Club Challenge to Wigan, 20-14, at ANZ Stadium in June in front of a WCC record attendance of 54,220 fans.
Gee toiled with the Broncos through the club's domination of the 1997 Super League season and took his place in the champion Brisbane team that won the 1998 NRL grand final. In 1998 he also won the club's player of the year award.
He left the club at the end of 1999 to join Warrington but later returned to the Broncos, along with former captain Allan Langer, for the 2002 season.
Sometimes criticized for lack of discipline resulting in needless penalties which potentially cost his team victories, Gee finished his playing career in 2003. That year he also made the State of Origin team, some 13 years after his first representative match. He was the first player to play 250+ games for the Broncos.
Early in the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Gee. In 2009 Gee was inducted into the Broncos official Hall of Fame.
Coaching and administration career.
Gee continued to serve at the Broncos assisting the coaching staff. In 2010 he was appointed the club's general manager of football operations.

Sofronie of Cioara

Sofronie of Cioara () is a Romanian Orthodox saint. He was an Eastern Orthodox monk who advocated for the freedom of worship of the Romanian population in Transylvania.
Early life.
Sofronie was born in the first half of the 18th century in the Romanian village of Cioara, now Săliştea, Transylvania, which was at the time part of the Austrian Habsburg Empire. His Christian given name name was Stan and his family name was Popa (or Popovici, according to other sources). His family name suggests that one of his ancestors was a priest, as in Romanian "popǎ" means priest. Sofronie also became an Orthodox priest and he remained in Cioara until the death of his wife, when he went to the a monastery in Wallachia (possibly the Cozia Monastery) and became a monk.
After becoming a monk, Sofronie returned to Cioara and built a small wooden Orthodox monastery in the forest close to the village. He devoted his life to monasticism until 1757, when he started to lead the peaceful uprising of the Romanian Orthodox population in Transylvania against the Habsburg policy of encouraging all Romanians to join the Greek-Catholic Church.
Religion in Habsburg Transylvania.
The Habsburg Empire was a conglomerate of different states and people. In this conglomerate, the Roman Catholic religion served to strengthen the other forces of cohesion, dynastic, absolutism, bureaucratic, or military, and provided a political instrument for domination and unification. In addition to various measures designed to protect Catholicism, which at the time was very weak in Transylvania (predominantly Romanian Orthodox), the Habsburgs tried to strengthen it in other ways. The fact that the Romanian people, due to their Orthodox religion, were only tolerated in Transylvania presented an excellent opportunity, and the Habsburgs believed that by winning over the Romanians they would strengthen their position in the region.
In 1701, the Emperor Leopold I decreed Transylvania's Orthodox Church to be one with the Roman Catholic Church. Therefore, Transylvanians were encouraged to become Catholics and adhere to the newly created Greek-Catholic Church by retaining their Orthodox ritual, but accepting the four doctrinal points established by the Council of Florence between 1431 and 1445: the Pope as the supreme head of the church; the existence of Purgatory; the Filioque clause; and the use of unleavened bread in Holy Communion. The clergy first had to be won over with the material advantages of the union, which would mean equality with the Catholic priesthood, including their income and their privileges. However, many of the Orthodox priests did not join the Union and, as Seton-Watson wrote in his book, "despite all handicaps, the devotion of the common people to the ancient faith was truly touching and the latent demand for an Orthodox bishop and freedom of religion slowly became more vocal and was roused by the Uniate example".
Sofronie's movement (1759–1761).
Sofronie, as a Transylvanian Orthodox monk, preached against the union with the Catholics and against the increasing pressure put on the Orthodox communities to join this union. In the spring of 1757, the Austrian authorities from the nearby village of Vinţu de Jos destroyed Sofronie's small monastery in an attempt to eliminate the Orthodox resistance in Transylvania. The authorities also started to arrest all the members of the Orthodox clergy preaching against the union. In order to escape the arrest, Sofronie was forced to leave Cioara, but the Orthodox community of the region, continued to remain faithful to their religion.
After some evidence of popular discontent of the Transylvanian Orthodox, in 1759 the Empress Maria Theresa issued her first Edict of Toleration, which seemed far too modest in scale to the people concerned, and only served to increase disturbances. 
On 6 October 1759, Sofronie addressed the Romanian Orthodox community from Brad, in Hunedoara county, informing the people that the Empress' Edict of Toleration allowed the Romanian population in Transylvania to choose freely between the Orthodox and the Greek-Catholic Church. The authorities in Vienna became worried and imperial troops hunted down the preacher. He was arrested by the authorities and jailed in Bobâlna, a village in the Hunedoara county. On 13 February 1760, Sofronie was forcibly released, after the revolt of some 600 Romanian peasants led by the Orthodox priest from Cioara, Ioan.
Sofronie continued his preachings against the Union with Rome in Ţara Zarandului and Ţara Moţilor. On 21 April 1760 he addressed the Romanian Orthodox community from Zlatna, and on 12 May, he addressed the one from Abrud. The Austrian Council of Ministers in Vienna, alarmed by his popularity, decided on 3 June to arrest and then kill Sofronie.
On 2 August in the Abrud Church, Sofronie was once again arrested by the authorities and transferred to Zlatna. After the revolt of some 7,000 peasants from the area, he was once again forcibly released and then guarded and kept in hiding by the peasantry employed in the royal mines of Abrud. For a time, they were in virtual revolt and openly declared that "the power of the lords is at an end, it is we who are now the masters". 
On 14–18 February 1761, at Alba Iulia, Sofronie organized a meeting of the Transylvanian Orthodox Synod, which demanded total freedom of worship in Transylvania. The Austrian authorities sent the General Adolf von Buccow to pacify the region and arrest Sofronie, who, just before being arrested, managed to escape to Wallachia, where he had many sympathizers. Sofronie remained in Wallachia until his death. He continued to dedicate his life to Orthodox monasticism, as a monk at the monasteries of Robaia (1764–1766), Vieroşi (1766–1771) and then Curtea de Argeş, all in the Argeş County.
In reprisal for Sofronie's escape to Wallachia, General Buccow had almost all Orthodox monasteries in Transylvania burnt down. However, disturbances went on and, to bring back order, the Empress issued a new Edict of Toleration in 1769, which gave legal status to the "Eastern Greek Cult" (i.e. the Orthodox), making it an official religion in Transylvania. In reality tensions remained, and only under Emperor Joseph II was a climate of religious tolerance brought in with the Edict of 8 November 1781. This resulted in many Romanians going back to the Orthodox Church, showing that an element of compulsion was present in many of the previous conversions.
Results of the movement and its legacy.
Sofronie's movement led to the peaceful uprising of the Romanian Orthodox peasant population in order to change the status of their Church from only "tolerated", despite being the majority of the Transylvanian population, to "officially recognised". In the end, the Orthodox achieved a notable victory: recognition by the court of Vienna of the legal existence of their church and the appointment of a bishop in the person of Dionisie Novacovic. He was the first bishop for the Transylvanian Orthodox population since 1701, when the authorities abolished the Orthodox Metropolitanate from Alba Iulia. 
Historian Keith Hitchins proposed an explanation for the strong devotion of the common people to their ancient faith, even though the Union with Rome would have brought them many more advantages and privileges. 
The intellectuals linked with the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church had a different approach to the problem of the Romanian nation in Transylvania. They possessed a keen sense of history and they thought increasingly in terms of 'nation', creating in this way a new path of development for the Romanians in Transylvania.
The Orthodox movement led by Sofronie, focused on religion, and the movement of the Greek-Catholic scholars, focused on the idea of nation, in the end had complementary effects. They both kept alive the connection between the Romanians in Transylvania and those from Wallachia and Moldavia and can therefore both be seen as important steps made by Romanians towards their national unity.

Axiothea of Phlius ( fl. c. 350 CE) was a female student of Plato and Speusippus. 
She was born in Phlius, an ancient city in the Peloponnese which was under Spartan rule, when Plato founded his Academy. Axiothea is said by Themistius to have read Plato's "Republic" and then travelled to Athens to be his student. She studied in the Academy dressed as a man. After the death of Plato she continued her studies with Speusippus, Plato's nephew. 
A papyrus fragment from Oxyrhynchus mentions an unidentified woman who studied under Plato, Speusippus, and then Menedemus of Eretria. The fragment goes on to explain that "in her teens she was lovely and full of unstudied grace." This woman is probably Axiothea or Lastheneia of Mantinea.

What You Get Is What You See

"What You Get Is What You See" is a song by recording artist Tina Turner from her album "Break Every Rule" (1986). The song was written by the Terry Britten and Graham Lyle team and was notably different to the three previous singles that they had written for Turner, "What's Love Got to Do with It", "We Don't Need Another Hero" and "Two People", as it was an up-tempo country-tinged rock track featuring Eric Clapton on guitars. 
The 12" single included three versions of the song, the Extended Dance Mix, the Extended Rock Mix and a live version recorded in London in November 1986. A different live recording of the song was later used as the opening track on Turner's 1988 album "Tina Live in Europe". "What You Get Is What You See" was popular in Australia, where in 1989 it was used in a campaign for the New South Wales Rugby League. They later used the Tina Turner song "The Best" in another campaign. Tina Turner said in an interview that "What You Get is What You See" is her favorite song from the album.

Soná, Panama

Soná is a town in Soná District, Veraguas, Panama.
Sona city is located in Panama. It has been intermittently exploited by artisanal placer gold operations since Spanish colonial times. In the 1990s, Cyprus Minerals conducted stream sediment, soil and rock sampling on Sona. This work defined a 200 m by 300 m gold anomaly in soils, with assays up to 4.40 g/t Au. Oro Gold's work has confirmed the soil anomaly, with rock chip results up to 4.05 g/t Au. All three new anomalies are located outside the soil anomaly identified by Cyprus.
Mapping shows the property is underlain by granodiorite to monzonite intrusive rocks with andesite flows and tuffs.

Aşlı

Ashli or Aşlı (; pronounced ) was a mysterious medieval Volga Bulgarian town. In Russian chronicles it is known as Oshel ().
Whereas archaeologic excavations prove that the city appeared as early as in 11th century, the Tatar legends and the Russian "Tver Chronicle" state that the city was founded by Alexander the Great. At its heyday Ashli was a major trade and political centre. In 1220 it was ruined and burned by the troops of Sviatoslav Vsevolodovich. The "Tver Chronicle" is the only written source where Ashli is mentioned.
Downfall.
The downfall of the city is mentioned in the "Tver Chronicle", the only written mention of the city. The prince of Vladimir Yuri Vsevolodovich sent the expedition to sack Ashli under his brother, Sviatoslav.
The Russians under prince Sviatoslav, his brother Yaroslav and voyevoda Yeremey Glebovich reached the city by the Volga on their boats. They landed to the east of the city at the flat bank of the Volga.The Rostovans formed the right flank, the Pereslavleans the left, the prince and the Muromeans stayed in the center. One regiment stayed to protect the boats. Russians came across the forest and met the horseback Bulgars under their prince. Bulgars shot their arrows and retreated to the citadel.
The Russians reached the walls in a harsh battle and managed to set a fire at the walls. The fire, smoke and wind were so strong, that Russians were forced to retreat and to enter the city from another side. However, Ashli's prince and his horseback retinue escaped under cover of smoke. However, foot warriors and civilians were killed in action. The fire was so strong that many invaders who dared to enter Ashli to rob the city perished . The Russians took into prison many civilians and retreated by the Volga. The reinforcement, sent from Bilär, the capital, was too late.
Search and excavations.
For a long period there weren't any ruins to identified as Ashli. Vasily Tatishchev assumed Yantikovsky (Kirelsky) ruins in what is today Kamskoustyinsky District (Kama-Ustjin District) to be remains of "Ashla", as he wrote. Another supporter of this version, A. Smirnov, advanced that the name of the city comes from the Esegel tribe of the Volga Bulgars. Yantikovsky ruins were flood with the infill of Kuybyshev Reservoir in 1950s, however, they were totally explored. There weren't scents of the mentioned great fire in Yantikovsky ruins.
Today the ruins are assumed to be near the village of Bogodashkino, Tetyushsky District. Bogdashkino is a village located on the upper course of Kilna River, between Proley-Kasha and Iokovo villages, about five kilometres north of Uryum village, on the land which is inhabited by Tetyushi Mordvins, about 16 kilometres south-west of Tetyushi. The Bogodashkino ruins were founded in 1909 by Ğäynetdin Äxmärev and the excavations took place in 1949-1950 under Nikolay Kalinin. He also excavated Yantikovsky ruins and decided that Ashli was situated near Bogodashkino. The remains of the fortress, the apartments, workshops, pottery and foundry were unearthed. The Muslim burial ground found there dates back to the 11-13th centuries. The last expeditions of 1987 and 2003 provided a good matter for historians.
Controversial theories.
Some "Cäğfär Taríxı"-based versions place Aşlı in the modern Kazan and state the victory of Bulgars under Gabdulla Chelbir and defeat of the Russians and the Udmurts.

Liberty Radio is a UK radio broadcaster and company based in London, England that, , is transmitted free to air from the Astra 2F satellite at 28.2° East to most of Europe, and on the Internet, but not on analog or DAB terrestrial radio. The station is also available to subscribers to BSkyB on the Sky EPG at LCN 186. The company started as Viva 963, broadcasting on terrestrial radio, predominantly for women, and was later renamed. It lost its terrestrial broadcasting licence in 2002 after being acquired by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (UCKG); the broadcasting slot was taken over by Buzz Asia, with different content.
History.
Viva 963.
The station started on 3 July 1995 as Viva 963, a service of talk and pop aimed at women devised by public relations consultant Lynne Franks. It broadcast on 963 kHz on medium wave from a transmitter at Lea Bridge Road, Leyton. A second transmitter, broadcasting on 972 kHz, was later added at Glade Lane, Southall, Middlesex.
963 Liberty (Fayed).

The broadcasting slot.
UCKG were not allowed to change the format to religious programming, but did broadcast programmes linked to their UCKG Help Centres in the evenings. In February 2001 Ofcom issued a "Yellow Card" to Liberty Radio over religious content and giving undue prominence to its owners, the UCKG, breaching two rules of the Advertising and Sponsorship Code. Changes were made as a result.
At the time there were rules preventing stations owned by religious organisations from owning digital radio licences in the UK. Therefore Liberty could not move onto DAB, and did not get an automatic license renewal. Their broadcasting licence was readvertised, and was awarded on 12 November 2002 to Club Asia, who took over 963 and 972 MW at midnight on 3 July 2003. Club Asia went into administration in August 2009 and was taken over by Sunrise Radio Group, itself owned by Litt Corporation, who branded it "Buzz Asia", later "Buzz Radio".
Programming.
Since the loss of the terrestrial broadcasting licence Liberty Radio has been broadcasting a mixture of pop, r'n'b, easy listening and Christian music, and a variety of talk shows on the Internet, Sky Digital and the Eurobird satellite. In addition to more general music and talk, the Liberty Radio website lists prayer and religious programmes, the VYG connection (the VYG is the Victory Youth Group, the "youth ministry of the UCKG HelpCentre"), Christian hits and gospel songs.

Indian old field

Indian Old Field, or simply Old Field, was a common term used in Colonial American times and up until the early nineteenth century United States, by white explorers, surveyors, cartographers and settlers, in reference to land formerly cleared and utilized by Indians for farming (corn fields or vegetable patches) or occupation. The term appears in many old maps and land documents, often persisting for many decades. It also remains in a number of present-day place names of the Eastern US.
Infectious disease epidemics may partially explain why these areas were abandoned in advance of the arrival of white observers. These outbreaks killed in excess of 90% of the population in the hardest hit areas of North America in the wake of initial European contact.
History.
Pioneer settlers, in applying for their land grants, exhibited a strong preference for sites located along major trails and particularly those coinciding with these Old Fields. Thus, early land survey plats emphasized these features and many place names from New England south to Florida represent vestiges of these places.
The earliest white settlers of Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley, which had been vacated by the Indians, noted “Indian old fields”. On the earliest Virginia map to show the upper Chesapeake watershed and Allegheny Mountains in any detail (the Jefferson-Fry map of 1751) an extensive area of “old fields” known as “Shawno Fields” was designated at the mouth of the South Branch of the Upper Potomac River. (About nine miles upstream further extensive clearings were noted by the first settlers. A post office and community, "Old Fields", exists at this site to the present day.)
In the 1750s, the explorer and surveyor Christopher Gist — traveling near the Ohio River in what later became western West Virginia — wrote in his journal of "Indian old fields" describing "large meadows, fine clover Bottoms & spacious Plains covered with wild Rye".
A 1761 visitor to the colony of South Carolina noted:
"There are dispersed up and down the country several large Indian old fields, which are lands that have been cleared by the Indians, and now remain just as they left them. There arise in many places fine savannahs, or wide extended plains, which do not produce any trees; these are a kind of natural lawns, and some of them as beautiful as those made by art.
As recently as 1912, a genealogist in northern West Virginia published the following definition:
"Old Fields" is a common expression for land that has been cultivated by the Indians and left fallow, which is generally overrun with what they call "broom grass"
"Old Field" place names.

West Virginia:
Kentucky:
Georgia:

The name of Clearfield County, Pennsylvania is also thought to be related to Indian old fields.

Red Shadows

The Red Shadows are the fictional fighting force originated and designed as 3 3/4 inch figures by Palitoy. They were conceived as enemies to Action Force and later depicted in the UK "Battle Action Force" comic books. Later US "G.I. Joe" storylines have revived the Red Shadows as an additional enemy faction in the G.I. Joe universe.
History and characterization.
Conceived and designed by Palitoy's marketing and design teams the Red Shadows were later portrayed in the British "Battle Action Force" comic books. The Red Shadows are led by Baron Ironblood and are believed to be fanatical in their devotion to their leader and cause, as described in their comic strip portrayal:
""An Evil genius threatens the world. His name is Baron Ironblood and his twisted criminal brain dreams of only one thing...world domination. Using powerful and sophisticated weaponry, Ironblood's ruthless followers would gladly die for their master. Baron Ironblood has vowed to destroy Action Force""
The Red Shadows were an enemy force created to face a second generation of Action Force characters following the evolution of the Action Force range (see the "History of Action Force").
Graphic representation.
The standard Red Shadows (predominantly the infantry troops) were controversially depicted in the comic books and annuals of the mid-1980s in quasi-German military uniform from the World War II era. Their red clothing was similar in style to the WWII German military wear including long black boots, black gloves and 'Jerry' style helmets, albeit extended to cover the face. In addition, the weapons they carried also included German-style stick grenades and bazookas. This was due to the Red Shadow figure being made from a modestly altered (by adding the face plate) WWII German soldier figure from the first generation figure release.
Additional characters and vehicles also had strong associations with the German military in the WWII era - The Black Major for example (Baron Ironblood's deputy) was dressed in a similar style to an Allgemeine SS officer and the Shadowtrak armoured vehicle had a German-influenced design. Indeed one of the final storylines involving the Red Shadows had them operating alongside the Nazis in South America, including a re-animated Adolf Hitler (despite ostensibly being set in the present day). However, as the range developed, further characters were even more fantastical and included mutants, krakens, and cyborgs.
Training.
Potential candidates for Red Shadows are sent into an obstacle courses filled with traps, such as machine gun nests and anti-personnel mines with the use of other kinds of traps such as broken bridges, piranhas and grenades tied from nests above trees. Both Baron Ironblood and the Black Major weed out candidates not worthy of being Red Shadow soldiers by letting them die in the traps or shoot them with small arms.
Weaponry and vehicles.
The Red Shadows weapons, vehicles and armoury consisted of:
Roboskull.
The Roboskull was an aircraft-cum-spacecraft designed exclusively by Palitoy as representative of the Red Shadows aerial threat. Piloted by the Red Wolf character, it was similar to the "Star Wars" TIE Fighter design built around a human skull. Its wings rotated ostensibly to allow the craft vertical-take-off-and-landing (or VTOL) capability.
The Roboskull was heavily armoured and featured in numerous "Battle Action Force" storylines as a formidable weapon in the Red Shadows arsenal.
The aircraft had a single pilot cockpit together with a rear-gunner site and an escape chute. It also featured brainwashing equipment and wing-tip mounted searchlights.
The Roboskull was one of the few Palitoy Red Shadows creations that survived the transition to Cobra and continued to feature (still piloted by Red Wolf and, sometimes, by Wild Weasel) in comic storylines fighting AF alongside both Cobra and Red Shadow units.
Escape Armour.
The Escape Armour was part of the toy line manufactured by Palitoy. The Escape Armour itself was made using the same mould used for the Cobra S.N.A.K.E. armour which was released as part of the G.I. Joe range in the USA. The only major difference aside from decals between the two versions was the colour with the Cobra version being either blue or white and the Red Shadows version in their ubiquitous red.
The first release of the Red Shadow Escape Armour came packaged with a standard Red Shadow figure however the difference in moulding from the Red Shadow (fixed-limb) action figure and the multi-jointed Cobra action figures, caused some difficulty in the using the toy.
A later version was packaged with the European Cobra release and used the "H.I.S.S." tank-driver character and new decals to incorporate it into the range.
The armour was written into at least one storyline allowing Baron Ironblood to evade capture by SAS and Z Force units. Made from unknown materials, the armour was capable of withstanding missile attacks and could respond with flamethrower or a single anti-tank rocket.
Transition to Cobra.
In later editions of the "Battle Action Force" series, Ironblood betrays the Red Shadows, leaking information about their bases and intentions to the UN. As the Shadows are under attack, Ironblood goes into hiding and constructs a new identity for himself, becoming Cobra Commander, and creating Cobra as a new enemy force.
The continuity of the storyline was maintained as the Black Major (a former traitor from Action Force), Red Laser and Red Vulture re-grouped the Red Shadows and sought revenge against Cobra Commander and the newly amalgamated 'AF' whilst prominent Red Shadow character Red Jackal was given his own storyline, transforming to Destro and joining Cobra. Additional storylines saw the Red Shadows fighting alongside the Nazis against both Cobra and Action Force. In "Showdown for the Shadows", the Shadows make their final appearance.
Devil's Due Red Shadows.
Towards the end of the original Devil's Due "G.I. Joe" comic series, the Red Shadows were officially incorporated into the U.S. "G.I. Joe" canon.
The Devil's Due incarnation of the Red Shadows organisation bears little resemblance to the Red Shadows organisation that fought the UK "Action Force". The organisation is portrayed as an independent organisation that has no ties to Cobra.
Led by Wilder Vaughn, the group attempted to destroy both Cobra and G.I. Joe, ultimately killing G.I. Joe member Lady Jaye in the process of their attempt to wipe out both sides by way of eliminating key members of both organisations. Other Joe and Cobra Operatives killed include Tracker, Hardball, Glenda, Rampart, Big Boa, and Asa Negra. Xamot is thrown into a coma. Colton was shot by Vaughn but recovers. A Red Shadow named Mars Harring infiltrates the Jugglers, ultimately killing them and the resurrected Serpentor.
During the World War III storyline in "America's Elite", Cobra Commander recruits Dela Eden away from the Red Shadows and has another high-ranking Red Shadows operative, Arthur Kulik, killed when Cobra invades "The Coffin" prison facility.
2010 G.I. Joe Collectors' Convention.
In 2010, the Official G.I. Joe Collectors' Club held its annual G.I. Joe Collectors' Convention, and the exclusive set of figures for that year featured the Red Shadows, offered for the first time in the classic G.I. Joe figure format, rather than the less-articulated format in which they had originally appeared in Europe in the early days of Action Force.
The set included the Black Major, six Red Shadows, and six Red Torches, an entirely new division of soldiers who were flamethrower troopers for the Red Shadows. The set also featured a figure of Cobra Interrogator, who was acting as a go-between between the Red Shadows and Cobra, and G.I. Joe Team member Flint, who in the comic book included with the set was captured by the Red Shadows.
Additional Red Shadows items available at the Convention included a Red Shadows Bunker, which was remade from a Star Wars toy, and a Red Shadows Jeep, which was remade from an Indiana Jones vehicle, both Hasbro products from figure lines of the same scale.
The storyline in the comic book made no reference to the Devil's Due incarnation of the Red Shadows, and indicated that it had been believed that the Red Shadows had long been defeated.

On Silent Wings

"On Silent Wings" is a song by Tina Turner with guest vocals from Sting. Released in April 1996 in support of Turner's "Wildest Dreams" album, the single performed reasonably well on the U.S. Adult Contemporary music chart, peaking at number 24. Like much of Turner's later work, "On Silent Wings" enjoyed greater success in the UK, topping out just shy of the top ten at number 13 on the singles chart, while in Poland the track stayed at #1 for five weeks. The single included the country-flavoured single edit with additional guitar overdubs, later appearing on the 2004 compilation "All the Best", as well as a second alternative version of the track. Some formats also featured the non-album track "Do Something", written by Holly Knight and Mike Chapman and produced by Trevor Horn. 
The dance version of "On Silent Wings", re-mixed by Soul Solution, charted at #47 on the U.S. dance chart. Neither released nor supported by the label, that the dance mix charted at all was due almost entirely to its inclusion by D.J. Julian Marsh on his Centaur Music release "Winter Party 1998".
The music video released to support the single featured Turner standing on the edge of a cliff in a white dress interspersed with live performance clips.

1929–30 British Home Championship

The 1929-30 British Home Championship was an edition of the annual international football tournament played between the British Home Nations. 1930 was the year in which the tournament finally gained a serious rival as the premier international football competition, with the inception of the 1930 FIFA World Cup, held in Uruguay. The Home Nations were not however members of FIFA due to disputes over the growing professionalism in continental and South American football. As a result they were not able to attend and indicated that even if they were invited they would have no interest in attending, deeming foreign opposition too weak for serious contest. It is interesting to speculate what would have happened had the Home Nations entered the tournament, especially as the tide of world football was changing against Britain. The England team, which dominated the 1930 championship, had lost to Spain the year before in the first defeat by a foreign football team, and in the same year they only managed draws with Germany and Austria. The Scottish side, which had won most of the previous ten championships, was likewise unprepared, only playing its first game outside the British Isles in 1929, and being heavily defeated on tour in 1931 by both the Austrians and the Italians.
The tournament reflected the highly attacking style of play popular in Britain at the time, with very high scoring in all games, the lowest total was three and two games saw seven goals and two more six. The English won all three matches at a canter, scoring fourteen goals and brushing aside their opposition to take the title. The fancied Scots also performed well, winning against Wales and Northern Ireland before succumbing to England in the final match. In the decider for last place, the Irish hammered the Welsh seven goals to nil at Windsor Park, taking third place in an exciting competition which even at this stage many still considered the world's most prestigious.

The Russian submarine "AG-12" was an AG-class (AG = "Amerikansky Golland") submarine which served in the Gulf of Finland during World War I. 
During the war, Russian submarines operated from bases in Finland. "AG-12" and three of her sisters were scuttled in Hanko harbor on 3 April 1918, just prior to the German landing there. "AG-12" and "AG-16" seemed to be in relatively good shape and the Finns decided to salvage them. The submarine was transferred to Turku for repairs, although it proved to be hopeless, and she was soon scrapped.

Aspetuck, Connecticut

Aspetuck is a village, which in Connecticut is an unincorporated community on the Aspetuck River, in Fairfield County, Connecticut, mostly in the town of Easton but extending also into Weston. 
It is significant for being the location of the Aspectuck Historic District, a well-preserved collection of houses from the 18th and 19th centuries. The area was settled in the 17th century. It was a long-time home of Helen Keller. According to a New York Times real estate section article, "The district gets its name from the Aspetuck Indians, who lived along the river. In 1670, they sold the land to English settlers for cloth, winter wheat and maize valued at $.36." Weston was incorporated in 1787, and Easton was split out and incorporated in 1845.
Aspetuck Historic District.
The Aspetuck Historic District is a historic district that preserves part of the historic village. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.
The historic district occupies about on the banks of the Aspetuck River and includes the oldest section of Easton. The 22 houses in the historic district date from 1750 to 1850. Some structures in the district are examples of Colonial Revival architecture. The district is considered significant for being a "Connecticut farming community that hasn't seen much change" and the home of Helen Keller in her later years. Helen Keller, who was blind and deaf, often walked through the neighborhood by herself, using as her guide a fence that extended down to the Aspetuck River.
The historic district is defined to "exclude excessive back acreage" and also "the district stops short of the historical extent of the community in order to exclude an area where the majority of buildings would be noncontributing due to alterations or recent origin."
The district "is significant because it embodies the distinctive architectural and cultural-landscape characteristics of a farming community from the late colonial and early national periods... The widely spaced distribution of houses, most accompanied by a barn and all ith ample yards that once served as pasture, field or garden recalls the appearance of an inland Connecticut farming community when agriculture was the basis of the local economy. The predominant type of building in the district—the traditional center-chimney, gable-roofed dwelling—is also characteristic of Connecticut farming communities of the late 18th and early 19th centuries..."
The district is significant because a house on Redding "was the long-time home of Helen Keller, who lost her hearing and sight at an early age, and whose long struggle to overcome these handicaps has provided inspiration to millions..."
Significant structures in the district include:

Robert Anderton

Robert Anderton (c. 1560 – 25 April 1586) was an English Roman Catholic priest and martyr. He has been declared 'Blessèd' by the Roman Catholic Church. His feast day is 25 April.
He was born in Lancashire around 1560. He graduated from Oxford University in 1578. Shortly thereafter he went abroad and converted to Roman Catholicism. He entered the college at Reims in 1580, and there met William Marsden. The two were ordained to the priesthood there.
Upon finishing their studies, Anderton and Marsden set sail for England. They were caught in a storm while crossing the English Channel. They prayed that they would be allowed to die on land rather than at sea. They were driven ashore by the storm onto the Isle of Wight, and quickly seized by the local authorities. In court, they pleaded that they had not violated the law by landing in England, as their landing was involuntary, being forced ashore by the storm.
This led to their being summoned to London, where they were given the opportunity to take the Oath of Supremacy, acknowledging Elizabeth as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Although they acknowledged Elizabeth as their lawful queen in all secular affairs, they would not swear the Oath. As failure to take the oath was considered treason under the Second Act of Supremacy, Anderton and Marsden were found guilty of treason. The sentence was then confirmed, and a proclamation was published, explaining their guilt. They were taken back to the Isle of Wight near the spot where they had landed and executed by hanging, drawing, and quartering on 25 April 1586.
He was beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1929.

Guess (variety show)

Guess () was a Taiwanese television variety show, hosted by Jacky Wu and other hosts, that began on 4 July 1996 and ended its run on 18 August 2012. It was broadcast in Taiwan, weekly on Saturdays from 22:00 to 00:00 on free-to-air China Television (CTV) (中視) and syndicated to be broadcast in Singapore weekly on Saturdays 23:30 on free-to-air MediaCorp Channel U and Malaysia's 8TV weekly on Sundays 17:00 to 18:30.
The show was twice nominated for Best Variety Programme and hosts Jacky Wu and Aya won Best Host in a Variety Programme from two nominations, at the Golden Bell Awards.
History.
Guess started on 4 July 1996 as 我猜我猜我猜猜猜 (), but suffered low viewer ratings initially (apart from its pilot episode), until Jacky Wu took over the helm as the main male host on 21 March 1998. He has been the main host since, while his 2 female co-hosts have changed throughout the years. Former female hosts include Barbie Hsu (aka Da S), Dee Hsu (aka Xiao S), Matilda Tao, Aya Liu (柳翰雅), Rainie Yang, S.H.E. (Selina Ren, Hebe Tian and Ella Chen), Linda Jian (蝴蝶姐姐), and Yao Yao (郭書瑤).
Wu left the show on 3 July 2010, and hosting duies was taken up by Harlem Yu and Selina Jen. However due to Selina's filming accident in October 2010, Chen Han Dian (陳漢典) and Amber An (安心亞) filled in as co-hosts. Yu left the show on 28 January 2011 and the show went on a short hiatus. It relaunched with the new name on 12 March 2011, with Jacky Wu returning to the show as the main host and joined by Patty Hou as his new co-host. The show ended its 16 year run with more than 800 episodes on 18 August 2012.
While the show was still running in Taiwan, the production and writing staff were also working on the "talk" show Kangxi Lai Le, a variety show composed of star-studded topical and comedic interviews.
Segments.
Each show usually consists of 2 segments: "The truth cannot be faked" 真的假不了 and "Do not judge a book by its cover" 人不可貌相, but occasionally, especially during festivals, there will be specially organized segments. 
In the first segment, "The truth cannot be faked", four people will be invited, each claiming to be able to accomplish something seemingly unbelievable. However, only three of them are telling the truth. Invited celebrities will then have to distinguish ("guess") the one who is lying; if they fail to guess correctly, they will be sprayed with cold mist (dry ice).
In the second segment, "Do not judge a book by its cover", there will be a mini-contest, with five people vying for a title, such as "Prettiest schoolgirl"; invited celebrities are again asked to guess which one of them will be the eventual winner. The winner is usually picked by a panel of experts.
Many Taiwanese celebrities have been first "discovered" by their participation in this show, such as the winners of the mini-contests held in the segment "Do not judge a book by its cover". Some budding Taiwanese artistes have also used this show as a launching pad for their hosting or singing careers. Lastly, invited Taiwanese celebrities used the show to promote their latest albums, books, shows, etc.

German experts evaluated "AG-16", but the Finnish government never provided funds for the repairing of the submarine. The repairs would be costly and no shipyard were prepared to guarantee the results. The submarine was stored on dry land until 1929 when the Finnish government finally agreed on the new Fleet program, which also included new submarines. "AG-16" was then scrapped.

1921–22 famine in Tatarstan

The 1921–1922 famine in Tatarstan was a result of war communism policy, realized in Tatar ASSR as well as elsewhere in the USSR. It started in autumn 1921. More than 2,000,000 peasants starved, particularly in Arsk, Sviyazhsk, Mamadysh, Menzelinsk, Spassk, Tetyushi and Chelny kantons. 
At the end of 1921, the special committee "Tatpomgol" was established to cope with the famine. Right up to August 1922, Tatpomgol imported 8,000,000 pood (Russian pounds) of food, including 2,000,000 pounds of seed, with a loan. From the affected regions, 210,000 people, mostly children, were evacuated to Central Asia, Belarus and Siberia. 
The emergency feeding points were established throughout the republic. The Soviet government invited international organizations, such as International Workers Relief and American Relief Administration to improve the situation. On July 1, 1922, more than 1,600,000 were fed at those emergency points. The number of the victims is estimated at 400,000 to 600,000. Of the total number of farms, 86,000 disappeared (16.2% of total). After the famine, the leadership of the republic was dismissed.
Demographics.
The famine deaths of 2 million Tatars in Tatar ASSR and in Volga-Ural region in 1921-1922 was catastrophic as half of Volga Tatar population in USSR died. This famine is also known as "terror-famine" and "famine-genocide" in Tatarstan. The Soviets settled ethnic Russians after the famine in Tatar ASSR and in Volga-Ural region causing the Tatar share of the population to decline to less than 50%. All-Russian Tatar Social Center (VTOTs) has asked the United Nations to condemn the 1921 Tatarstan famine as Genocide of Muslim Tatars.

Michelle Ferguson-Cohen

Michelle Ferguson-Cohen is a children's book author, illustrator and publisher. Her father is a career military officer and Vietnam veteran. As a military brat herself, many of the picture books she develops are written for and feature military brats.
Career.
Ferguson-Cohen wrote, illustrated and published the first commercially available children's books for military brats. and the first children's picture books for children coping with deployment. She has been called the ""Dr. Seuss for Military Brats"" in a Washington Times article that was laudatory in tone about her books' ability to help children understand about their parent's military deployments. 
Ferguson-Cohen established Little Redhaired Girl Publishing to publish her books as part of a series she entitled Books for Brats to encourage pride in the term "Military Brat" outside the military community. Ferguson-Cohen's goal was to create material that would appeal to all children and introduce their military family neighbors. Though self-published, her titles ""Daddy, You're My Hero!"" and ""Mommy, You're My Hero!"" have reportedly reached hundreds of thousands of youthful readers through both targeted and broad based marketing. They were first published in 2001 and are in their 3rd edition. The books have also been used in the classrooms as material to promote tolerance and understanding amongst peers, and distributed to both commercial and civilian outlets.
Books for Brats were early to recognize and service the "suddenly military" families of the National Guard and Reserves. During the first deployments of the Iraq War, Ferguson-Cohen worked with Family Readiness Groups nationwide to host readings. She was able to obtain recommendations by many educational, medical and child development experts suggesting that her books could be utilized to explain deployment and convey coping skills to children facing separation from a parent. They are also suggested as resources for their unique content, multicultural illustrations and representations of female soldiers.
Sought out by the press as an expert in the military community, she became an advocate for military brats promoting equal representation for the military community in the media.
Prior to her career as children's author and advocate for military brats, Ferguson-Cohen was a music industry entrepreneur who owned an agency based in New York and London. During her career in the entertainment industry she was involved celebrity charity events to raise funds for UK-based NGO War Child. A writer and humorist, she is listed as a contributor to the Complete Idiot's Guide to Jokes.

Sursock family

The Sursock family (also Sursuq) is a Greek Orthodox family from the Lebanon. The Sursocks are one of Beirut's aristocratic Christian families, along with the Bustros, Dagher, Ferneini, Araman, Trad, and Tueni families. The family made its fortune as traders and landowners.
History.
For many decades, the Sursocks were Lebanon's leading business family. As business partners of the Otis Elevator Company, they were successful industrialists and played a key role in the developing manufacture of elevators.
According to Lady Cochrane Sursock, the name is a corruption of Κυριε Ισαακ ("Kyrie Isaac", meaning Lord Isaac), and the family left Constantinople at its fall in 1453, settling near Jbail.
Michel Sursock gained notoriety during the great famine in the First World War for hoarding grain and speculating on the supply. He would not sell the grain, which cost 40 piastres in peacetime, for less than 250 piastres.
Assets.
Rue Sursock, in the Achrafieh district of Beirut, is named after the family, which owned many palatial homes on the street, such as Sursock House. Nicolas Sursock bequeathed the house as a museum of art. In 1918, the Sursock family financed the building of the Beirut Hippodrome.
In 1882, a consortium headed by the Sursock family won an Ottoman concession to build a railway across the Jezreel Valley that would create a cheaper route for exporting grain from the Hauran. 
The family owned more than 60,000 acres (240 km²) in the Jezreel Valley in Palestine. In 1906, the Sursock family sold land in Palestine to the Jewish National Fund for a sum believed to be nearly three quarters of a million pounds. As a result, Arab tenant farmers were evicted.

UCR/California Museum of Photography

The UCR/California Museum of Photography (CMP) is an off-campus institution and department of the UCR College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. The CMP is located in the UCR ARTSblock, in Downtown Riverside. The collections of UCR/CMP form the largest, most comprehensive holding of any photographic collection in the Western half of the United States. The growing UCR/CMP collections encompass every aspect of photographic arts, history, and technology. It is located at 3824 Main Street, Riverside, California.
Collections overview.
The collections are organized as four interlinked main tiers.
Bingham Technology Collection.
The Bingham Technology Collection has grown from the original gift of 2,000 vintage cameras donated by Dr. Robert Bingham in 1973 to a current count of 10,000 cameras, viewing devices, and photographic apparatus. In 1975, Popular Photography declared that UCR’s Bingham Camera Collection was second only to the George Eastman House Collection in Rochester, New York, and the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.
The collection holds four synoptic subsets of camera technology: The Kibbey Zeiss-Ikon Collection; Curtis Polaroid Collection; Wodinsky Ihagee-Exacta Collection and the Teague Kodak Brownie Collection. Other significant artifacts include a Lewis daguerrean camera, a Simon Wing multi-lens wet-plate camera, a fully functioning Caille Brothers Cail-O-Scope, and a Ponti megalethoscope. As the most complete and actively used camera collection in the western states, this resource is highly valued by photography scholars, other museums, film/video producers, book/magazine publishers, regional schools, and photo clubs.
University Print Collection.
The University Print Collection was founded in 1979 when several community patrons purchased a remarkable collection of photographic master prints from The Friends of Photography. Currently, the collection exceeds 20,000 images that were created by over 1,000 photographers, including 7,000 Ansel Adams negatives. The University Print Collection includes quantities of vintage daguerreotypes, 1840s calotype negatives, Civil War era ambrotypes, and commercial tintypes as well as images from popular culture (1840s to present).
A major subset of the University Print Collection is the Keystone-Mast Collection, which comprises over 250,000 original stereoscopic negatives and 100,000 paper prints. The original glass and film negatives form a vital primary record of worldwide social, cultural, industrial, agricultural historicity between 1860 and 1950. The visual online catalogs of the Keystone-Mast Collection have been available on UCR/CMP website since 2001. A National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Preservation and Access Grant primarily funded these online catalogs.
Additional funding, by Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS), supports the MOAC project to create catalogs served on the California Digital Library.
UCR/CMP Study Center Library.
UCR/CMP Study Center Library and Roy McJunkin Imaging Center are interlinked research areas containing 10,000 photography monographs, manuscript materials, artists books, technical literature, exhibition catalogs, salon annuals and runs of photography periodicals, a copy stand, plus a full complement of expanding computer technology. International scholars, the education communities, and the museum staff utilize these research areas.
Digital Virtual Collection.
The Digital Virtual Collection is the digitized content of the museum’s collection. Since 1994 when the Museum first went online, UCR/CMP has added over 13,000 pages of content that include over 400 themed micro-sites and 9 major finding aids. Ongoing grants and initiatives have enabled the museum to continue work on the website and allowed for continued digitization of artifacts found in the museums collections.

<doc id="9675036" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9675036" title="Corruption in Nigeria">
Corruption in Nigeria

Political corruption is not a recent phenomenon that pervades the Nigerian country. Since the creation of modern public administration in the country, there have been cases of official misuse of resources for personal enrichment. 
Nigeria is ranked 139th out of 176 countries in Transparency International's 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index, tied with Azerbaijan, Kenya, Nepal, and Pakistan.
The rise of public administration and the discovery of petroleum and natural gas are two major events seen to have led to a litany of ignoble corrupt practices in the country. Over the years, the country has seen its wealth withered with little to show in living conditions of the average human being. A Nigerian political leader, Obafemi Awolowo raised a salient issue when he said, since independence, our governments have been a matter of few holding the cow for the strongest and most cunning to milk, Under those circumstances everybody runs over everybody to make good at the expense of others.
The pervasive corruption has been blamed on colonialism. According to this view, the nation's colonial history may have restricted any early influence in an ethical revolution. Throughout the colonial period, most Nigerians were stuck in ignorance and poverty. The trappings of flash cars, houses and success of the colonists may influence the poor to see the colonist as symbols of success and to emulate the colonists in different political ways.
Involvement in the agenda of colonial rule may also inhibit idealism in the early stage of the nascent nation's development. A view commonly held during the colonial days was that the colonists property (cars, houses, farms, etc.) is not "our" property. Thus vandalism and looting of public property was not seen as a crime against society. This view is what has degenerated into the more recent disregard for public property and lack of public trust and concern for public goods as a collective national property.
Petty corruption is reportedly widespread and surveys indicate that it is very hard to do business in Nigeria without having to pay facilitation payments to public officials. Companies should note that property rights, contracts and commercials disputes can be difficult to enforce and settle in Nigerian courts due to corruption, inefficiency and under-staffing. Tax administration lacks transparency that has led either to high levels of tax evasion or tax officials demanding bribes in return for lower tax rates. The police are perceived to be one of the most corrupt institutions in Nigeria, and X Squad, the disciplinary body responsible for investigating corruption inside the police is reportedly corrupt themselves as well.
Causes.
Some writers have posited about the different potential causes of flagrant and pecunious graft that exists in the country: many blame greed and ostentatious lifestyle as a potential root cause of corruption. To some, societies in love with ostentatious lifestyle may delve into corrupt practices to feed the lifestyle and also embrace a style of public sleaze and lack of decorum. The customs and attitudes of the society may also be a contributing factor. Gift giving as expressions of loyalty or tributes to traditional rulers may be fabrics of the society.
Also, a political environment that excludes favors towards elites or wealthy citizens may also be influenced by corruption. Wealthy elites may resort to sleaze in order to gain power and protect their interest. However, the bottom line surmised from the views of most Nigerians is that corruption is a problem that has to be rooted out. In Nigeria another major cause of corruption is ethnicity called tribalism in Nigeria. Friends and kinsmen seeking favor from officials may impose difficult strains on the ethical disposition of the official. Many kinsmen may see a government official as holding necessary avenues for their personal survival or gain.
A culmination of use of official resources for private gain may lead to further pressures on incoming officials from other kinsmen. However, the fact is, the importation of modern rules on inter-ethnic political relationships is a recent colonial and western initiative that may take time to become the norm, deep allegiance to other ethnic groups for administrative decisions early on was sometimes viewed suspiciously, and an early institutionalization of a unitary system in the country, may also have led to a further familiar groupings induced corruption. Nevertheless, a modern practical approach to leadership and relationships has gradually taken a prominent role in the political process. The necessity for practical inter-dependence and cooperation is at the forefront of yearnings for good governance in the country.
History and Cases.
Pre-Independence and the First Republic.
Corruption, though prevalent, was kept at manageable levels during the First Republic. However, the cases of corruption during the period were sometimes clouded by political infighting. 
Gowon Administration.
Corruption for the most part of Gowon's administration was kept away from public view until 1975. However, some informed officials voiced concerns, Gowon critics labeled his governors as misguided individuals acting like lords overseeing their personal fiefdom. He was viewed as timid, in terms of being decisive against corrupt elements in his government. 
Shagari Administration.
Corruption was deemed pervasive during the administration of Shagari.
Babangida Administration.
The regime of General Ibrahim Babangida is seen as the body that legalized corruption. His administration refused to give account of the Gulf War windfall, which is estimated to be $12.4 billion. He annulled a democratic election in Nigeria on June 12, 1993 and decided to instate Ernest Shonekan as his successor in August 27, 1993 when he stepped down as head of the military regime. However, within 3 months of the handover, General Sani Abacha seized control of the government while Babangida was on a visit to Egypt.
He lives in a very exquisite mansion in his home state (Niger-state) in the Northern part of the country.
Abacha Administration.
The death of the general Sani Abacha revealed the global nature of graft. French investigations of bribes paid to government officials to ease the award of a gas plant construction in Nigeria revealed the global level of official graft in the country. The investigations led to the freezing of accounts containing about $100 million United States dollars. 
Public institutions perceived as corrupt.
The following list contains the institutions perceived as the most corrupt. It is culled from the Nigeria Survey and Corruption Survey Study, Final Report (June 2003) Institute for Development Research, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (IDR, ABU Zaria).

Bassett High School

Bassett High School is a comprehensive public high school in Bassett, Virginia, USA. The school currently enrolls about 1,200 students in grades 9–12. It is one of two public high schools operated by Henry County Schools.
Opened in 1978, the school is located approximately two miles south of the Bassett community in Henry County, Virginia.
Campbell Court Elementary, Carver Elementary, Collinsville Primary, John Redd Smith Elementary, Sanville Elementary, and Stanleytown Elementary feed into Fieldale-Collinsville Middle School, which feeds into Bassett High School.
History.
Bassett High School opened in 1978, replacing the former John D. Bassett High School, which became a middle school. Declining enrollment in the 1990s left each of the four Henry County high schools operating at less than 50% capacity. In 2003, the county implemented a controversial reorganization plan which consolidated Fieldale-Collinsville High School and Bassett High School at the Bassett High School site. The school name and mascot remained the same but orange, one of the Fieldale-Collinsville school colors, was added to the Bassett blue and white. Following its closure as a high school, Fieldale-Collinsville became a middle school, serving students in the Bassett High School attendance zone.
Demographics.
Bassett High School's student body is 73% White; 21% Black; and 5% Hispanic. Forty-three percent of Bassett students receive free or reduced lunch.
The school serves a geographic area which encompasses the communities of Bassett, Collinsville, Fieldale, Oak Level, Stanleytown and Villa Heights.[http://henryva.schoolwires.com/magnavista/lib/magnavista/Attendance%20Zone.pdf?3442_60119111832Nav=|&NodeID=282] The current principal is John M. Gibbs
Academics.
The school operates on a 4x4 block schedule. The school year is divided into two semesters and six six-week grading periods. Students may earn eight course credits during one school year. Students are also offered summer school programs to boost their GPAs.
Bassett High School's program of studies includes ten Advanced Placement (AP) courses, and other career development and technical courses. The school provides opportunities for some of its students to attend the Piedmont Governor's School for Mathematics, Science, and Technology, which is located on the campus of Patrick Henry Community College.
Accreditation.
Bassett High School is fully accredited based on the 2010-2011 results of the Virginia Standards of Learning tests. The school has met federal standards for Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) as required by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.
Athletics and Extracurricular Programs.
Bassett teams play in the AA Piedmont District of the AA Region IV. The mascot is the Bengal. The Bengal athletic program competes in the Virginia High School League's interscholastic sports. The varsity football team won the AA Region IV championship in 2006. Prior to consolidation, the school won the state AA girls' basketball championship in 2000 and the AA boys' track title in 1980. 
Martinsville High School has been a traditional rival, but a strong rivalry has emerged with Magna Vista High School since reorganization of the county schools.
Bassett Marching Band.
Bassett's marching band is a nationally recognized organization that participates in several local, state, and national competitions. In 2009, the band won the Virginia state title in the United States Scholastic Band Association and placed second in its class in the national competition.

Globe Wernicke

History.
The Globe-Wernicke Company was formed as a result of the Cincinnati based Globe Files Company (est. in 1882) purchasing the Minneapolis based Wernicke Company, founded in 1893 by Otto Wernicke, in 1899. The company is best known for their high end bookcases, Desks, and other office furniture. Globe Wernicke established factories in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France and Germany.
The company patented the 'elastic bookcases' also known as a modular bookcase. These were a high quality stacking book shelves, with a standard width of 34 inches, in Oak, Walnut and Mahogany, capable of being adapted to fit together to form a bookcase which could either be all of the same measurements or which could be re-arranged by the insertion of units of different depths and heights. These glass fronted shelves now are proving to be collectable, desirable and usable antiques - with regularity these bookcases appear in auctions and internet sites and, what originally cost $75 or so will now be sold for $900 or more.
During World War II 90% of the company's business in the US was converted to produce military equipment.

<doc id="9675071" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9675071" title="Ezhava">
Ezhava

The Ezhavas are a community with origins in the region of India presently known as Kerala. They are also known as "Ilhava", "Irava", "Izhava" and "Erava" in the south of the region; as "Chovas", "Chokons" and "Chogons" in Central Travancore; and as "Thiyyas", "Tiyyas" and "Theeyas" in Malabar. Some are also known as "Thandan", which has caused administrative difficulties due to the presence of a distinct caste of that name in the same region. The Malabar Tiyya group have claimed a higher ranking in the Hindu caste system than do the others, although from the perspective of the colonial and subsequent administrations they were treated as being of similar rank.
As well as being agricultural laborers, small cultivators, toddy tappers, and liquor businessmen, some Ezhavas were also involved in weaving and some practised ayurvedic medicine. Ezhava dynasties such as the Izhathu Mannanars also existed in Kerala. The Chekavar, a warrior section within the community, were part of the militias of local chieftains and kings. There were also renowned kalaripayattu experts among them.
History.
Legend.
According to legend and some Malayalam folk songs, the Ezhavas were the progeny of four bachelors that the king of Ceylon sent to Kerala at the request of the Chera king "Bhaskara Ravi Varma", in the 1st Century AD. These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up coconut farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan King sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.
Social and religious divergence.
It has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the Nair caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the Zamorins of Calicut and the rulers of the Cochin dynasty. Cyriac Pullapilly has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.
A theory has been proposed for the origins of the caste system in the Kerala region based on the actions of the Aryan Jains introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they "... were given "kshatriya" functions, but only "shudra" status. Thus originated the Nairs." The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.
An alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the Nambudiri Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.
The Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society. This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.
Past occupations.
The social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas "... consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade." A. Aiyappan, another social anthropologist and himself a member of the caste, noted the mythical belief that the Ezhava brought coconut palms to Kerala when they moved from Sri Lanka. Their traditional occupation, or "avakasam", was tending to and tapping the sap of such palms. This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as "toddy tapping", toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of coir products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th-century. The coastal town of Alleppey became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after World War I led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The Great Depression impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.
Some Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.
Martial traditions.
Many were employed as guards or sentinels in the palaces of Cochin and Travancore. Syrian Christians of Kerala, who were privileged in the pre-colonial period to have their own private armies, recruited Ezhava members due in part to this tradition.
Chekavar.
A subgroup of the Thiyyas considered themselves to be warriors and became known as the Chekavars. The "Vadakkan Pattukal" ballads describe Chekavars as forming the militia of local chieftains and kings but the title was also given to experts of Kalari Payattu.
Medicine and traditional toxicology.
Some Ezhavas had an extensive knowledge of the medicinal value of plants, passed to them by their ancestors. Known as "Vaidyars", these people acted as physicians. Itti Achuden was probably the best known Ezhava physician who directly influenced the classification of "Hortus Malabaricus" in the 17th century. Itti Achuden's texts were written in the Kolezhuthu script that Ezhava castes used, for they were prevented from learning the more sanskritized Aryazuthu script which was the preserve of the upper-castes.
Some Ezhavas practiced ayurvedic medicine.
Culture.
Aivar kali.
Literally, Aivarkali means the play of the five sets. This was a ritualistic art form performed in almost all important temples of Kerala. Today it is found in central Kerala. This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the "Mahabharatha"), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a nilavilakku at its centre. The five or more performers with their leader called Kaliachan enter the performance area after a ritualistic bath, with sandalwood paste over their foreheads, dressed in white dhoti, and with a towel wrapped around their heads.
Arjuna Nrtam (Mayilppili Tukkam).
Arjuna Nrtam ("the dance of Arjuna") or Mayilppili Tukkam is a ritual art performed by men of Ezhava community and is prevalent in the Bhagavathy temples of south Kerala, mainly in Kollam, Alappuzha and Kottayam districts. Arjuna nritham is also called "Mayilpeeli Thookkam" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli (peacock feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the "uduthukettu" of Kathakali. The various dance movements are closely similar to Kalarippayattu techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears. The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.
Makachuttu.
Makachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in Thiruvananthapuram and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in Kilimanoor, Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. Sandalwood paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume. This is a combination of snake worship and Kalarippayattu.
Parichamuttu kali.
Parichamuttu kali is a martial folk-dance prevalent among the Ezhavas around the Alappuzha, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Palghat and Malappuram districts. It is also performed by Christians and some other Hindu communities. Its origins date back to when Kalaripayattu, the physical exercise of swordplay and defence, was in vogue in Kerala. The performers dance with swords and shields in their hands, following the movements of sword fight, leaping forward, stepping back and moving round, all the time striking with the swords and defending with shields.
Poorakkali.
Poorakkali is a folk dance prevalent among the Ezhavas of Malabar, usually performed in Bhagavathy temples as a ritual offering during the month of Meenam (March–April). Poorakkali requires specially trained and highly experienced dancers, trained in Kalaripayattu, a system of physical exercise formerly in vogue in Kerala. Standing round a traditional lamp, the performers dance in eighteen different stages and rhythms, each phase called a niram.
Teyyam (Teyyattam) or Kaliyattam.
In northern Kerala, Teyyam is a popular ritual dance. This particular dance form is also known as Kaliyattam. The main deities of Ezhavas include Vayanattu Kulavan, Kativannur Viran, Pumarutan and Muttappan.
Customs.
Ezhavas adopted different patterns of behavior in family system across Kerala. Those living in southern Travancore tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern Malabar were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.
These arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the Nairs, another Hindu caste in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called "taravadu" and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.
Spiritual and social movements.
Some Thiyyas converted to Islam from around the 9th century, due to the influence of Arab traders. These people, and other Muslim converts in the region, are now known as Mappillas. A sizeable part of the Ezhava community, especially in central Travancore and in the High Ranges, embraced Christianity during the British rule, due to caste-based discrimination. In Kannur, Protestant missions started working in the first half of the 19th century, notably the Basel German Evangelical Mission. Most of their converts were from the Thiyya community. The Congregationalist London Missionary Society and the Anglican Church Mission Society were also prominent in the movement for religious conversion, having established presences in the Travancore region in the early nineteenth century.
The lowly status of the Ezhava meant that, as Thomas Nossiter has commented, they had "little to lose and much to gain by the economic and social changes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries". They sought the right to be treated as worthy of an English education and for jobs in government administration to be open to them. An early Ezhava campaigner and their "political father", according to Ritty Lukose, was Padmanabhan Palpu. In 1896, he organised a petition of 13,176 signatories that was submitted to the Maharajah of the princely state of Travancore, asking for government recognition of the Ezhavas' right to work in public administration and to have access to formal education. The upper caste Hindus of the state prevailed upon the Maharajah not to concede the request. The outcome not looking to be promising, the Ezhava leadership threatened that they would convert from Hinduism en masse, rather than stay as helots of Hindu society. C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer, realizing the imminent danger, prompted the Maharajah to issue the Temple Entry Proclamation, which abolished the ban on lower-caste people from entering Hindu temples in the state of Travancore. Steven Wilkinson says that Proclamation was passed because the government was "frightened" by the Ezhava threat of conversion to Christianity.
Eventually, in 1903, a small group of Ezhavas established Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalan Yogam (SNDP), the first caste association in the Kerala region, naming it after Narayana Guru, who had established an "ashram" from where he preached his message of "one caste, one religion, one god" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of Swami Vivekananda. The organisation attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful. In Malabar, which unlike Cochin and Travancore was under direct British control, the Tiyyas showed little interest in such bodies because they did not suffer the educational and employment discrimination found elsewhere, nor indeed were the disadvantages that they did experience strictly a consequence of caste alone.
The Ezhavas were not immune to being manipulated by other people for political purposes. The Vaikom Satyagraha of 1924–1925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of "avarna" access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of Congress, orchestrated by T. K. Madhavan, a revolutionary and civil rights activist, and with a famous temple at Vaikom as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the satyagraha (movement) did succeed in voicing a "radical rhetoric", according to Nossiter. During this movement, a few Akalis—an order of armed Sikhs—came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the Temple Entry Proclamation, some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to Sikhism.
The success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned. Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, "From the Vaikom "satyagraha" onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position." The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the Great Depression on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the Nair Service Society (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.
Position in society.
Although Ezhavas performed the works associated Sudra varna, they were considered as "avarna" (untouchable) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala. Kathleen Gough says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the "higher polluting castes", a group whose other constituents included Kanisans and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the "lower polluting castes", such as the Pulayars and Paraiyars. The Nairs and, where applicable, the Mapillas ranked socially and ritually higher than the polluting castes. From their study based principally around one village and published in 2000, the Osellas noted that the movements of the late-nineteenth and twentieth century brought about a considerable change for the Ezhavas, with access to jobs, education and the right to vote all assisting in creating an identity based on more on class than caste, although the stigmatic label of "avarna" remained despite gaining the right of access to temples.
Dispute between Thiyya and Ezhava.
Some in the Thiyya community have objected to being treated as Ezhava by the government of Kerala. They have campaigned for the right to record themselves as Thiyya rather than as Ezhava when applying for official posts and other jobs allocated under India's system of positive discrimination. They claim that the stance of the government is contrary to a principle established by the Supreme Court of India relating to a dispute involving communities who were neither Ezhava nor Thiyya. The Thiyya Mahasabha has also opposed the SNDP's use of the Thiyya name at an event.
In February 2013, the recently formed Thiyya Mahasabha objected to the SNDP treating Ezhavas and Thiyyas as one group, rather than recognising the Thiyyas in Malabar as being distinct. The SNDP was at that time attempting to increase its relatively weak influence in northern Kerala, where the politics of identity play a lesser role than those of class and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has historically been a significant organisation.

Swan Island Municipal Airport

The Swan Island Municipal Airport was a joint civil-military airport that was operational in the Overlook neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It opened officially in 1927, but the United States Postal Service had been using the field for a year. After the Portland–Columbia Super Airport was completed in the late 1930s, Swan Island Municipal Airport had little use since its runways were too small for newer aircraft and the low altitude made it difficult to land and take-off. It was operational for nearly two decades, but due in part to the advances in aviation, the airport became obsolete soon after its construction. During World War II, the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation was located at Swan Island and when they became obsolete after the war was over the Port of Portland built a dry dock on the airport site which continues to serve as one of their facilities.
History.
Oakley G. Kelly, the commanding officer at Pearson Airfield in Vancouver, Washington, was one of the first to seriously propose using Swan Island as an airfield. In 1926, the Port of Portland, assisted by the United States Postal Service (USPS), organized a committee to look for a location for a new airport in Portland. The group chose Swan Island which was a peninsula along the Willamette River. Objections over the airport started almost immediately, as postal workers who were using Pearson Airfield claimed Swan Island might flood. A plan was drawn-up to raise the elevation of Swan Island to keep floodwater out. W. L. Thompson spearheaded the commission and was the project's chief engineer. James H. Polhemus was the Port of Portland's general manager and chief engineer at the time.
In a proposal to the Port of Portland, the west channel of the Willamette River next to Swan Island would have to be widened, and a dike built to keep high water out. The project extended its timeline in May 1926, forcing the USPS to keep using Pearson Airfield in Vancouver to deliver mail to the city. Most of the commendations for the USPS at Swan Island Municipal Airport opened in September 1926, but commercial services were sill being readied. The airfield only took-up a fraction of the land on Swan Island. The other areas were cleared and leveled so industrial growth could take place. During its construction, the Port of Portland requested that the Swan Island Municipal Airport be the future site of the Pacific Coast Air Derby, which was approved.
Swan Island Municipal Airport officially dedicated in September 1927 by Charles Lindbergh who flew the Spirit of St. Louis onto the airstrip. Although the field was not officially complete, most of the facilities like hangars and landing strips were finished. Adjacent from the airport was Rankin Airfield, which was a private strip owned by a North Portland resident. Upon its completion, the airport cost US$557,073 (US$ adjusted for inflation). The official opener for the Swan Island Municipal Airport came on September 27 during the Pacific Coast Air Derby where six army plans performed for 10,000 paid spectators. A gravel runway was installed in 1928, replacing the old dirt one. In 1929, Varney Air Lines started passenger services between Portland and Boise, Idaho and later that year from Portland to Salt Lake City, Utah and Portland to Pasco, Washington.
The Port of Portland and the Portland City Council held meetings in 1935 to investigate a possible renovation of the Swan Island Municipal Airport. They determined that it would not be cost effective to rebuild the airport to accommodate larger aircraft. By 1936, citizens were petitioning the city council to fund a larger airport at a higher elevation. I. E. Oakes, the Works Progress Administration director for Portland announced in 1937 that he would look to secure US$627,781 (US$ adjusted for inflation) in funds from the federal government to build a new runway to accommodate large airlines. However, the federal government condemned the site and offered up funds to build a new airport.
After the Portland–Columbia Super Airport was constructed, the Swan Island Municipal Airport still operated, but in a diminished capacity. Flying students were banned from using the airport in their training programs due to the low altitude. The military removed their facilities from the airport and most commercial liners had moved their services to the new airport. During World War II, Swan Island was the location of the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation where 455 vessels were produced for the United States Military. After the war the obsolete shipyards and the old airstrip were converted into a dry dock for the Port of Portland where they still operate.

Derby Grammar School

Derby Grammar School is a selective independent school in Littleover near the city of Derby, England. Founded as a school for boys in 1995, it takes boys from the age of seven and currently has around three hundred pupils. The Sixth Form has been co-educational since September 2007. Although only recently founded, Derby Grammar School aims to continue the tradition and spirit of Derby School, founded in 1160.
The school is an affiliate member of the Woodard Corporation and is academically selective, admitting those within the top twenty-five percent of the ability range.
Premises.
The school occupies Rykneld Hall, a Grade II listed 18th century country house at Littleover, built as a private residence in 1780 and used as a hospital through the later 20th Century.
Teaching blocks for Humanities, Sciences, Design and Technology and Arts have been added to the site, along with the main hall, linking with the old quadrangle, containing a stage, organ and kitchen facilities. A new cricket pavilion has also recently been built.
The woodland, mature trees, grassland and water areas in the school's grounds are designated as Wildlife Site 38 and safeguarded in the City of Derby's Local Plan, Policy E4 (Nature Conservation). Such sites are "considered irreplaceable".
New school playing fields, located a short distance away from the main site, were officially opened in September 2006 by the England and British and Irish Lions rugby player Sir Clive Woodward.
Curriculum.
The curriculum is built around teaching for GCSE, IGCSE and A-level with some subjects being studied through the IB course. Subjects taught include English, Latin, French, German, Spanish, Classics, Maths, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, History, Ancient History, English Literature, Geography, Religious Studies, Art, Music, Design Technology and Economics.

The 2007 Under-15 rugby team were county champions. and have won the county cup twice, and the under 16s once. The 2007 under-16s were the first DGS team to win all their games, although the under-15s later did the same. In 2007, the under-16s reached the fourth round of the Daily Mail Cup, and over half of the team members also played for the First XV. The school's First XV '10/'11 were the school's first undefeated first team, with eight recorded victories throughout the season.
The school's rowing team also participates in the ball cup and the 2008 team ( D.Grant, O. Foulds, A Hughes & R Newbould + R.Proctor) came first in the men's coxed four.

There are music and drama workshops, some being joint events with Derby High School for girls and the Hot House Music Schools youth music group.
The School supports various charities, including the Children in Need Appeal, and in 2012 raised £8,000.
The school has links with the Gedeli School in the Mwanza Region of Tanzania and sends Sixth Form students out every year to assist with teaching, maintenance of classrooms and other tasks.
School motto and badge.
The school crest, badge and motto are based on, and reminiscent of those of Derby School. The school motto, "Vita Sine Litteris Mors" (Life without learning is death), is taken from the motto of the former school and is from Seneca's Epistulae morales ad Lucilium.
Old Derbeians.
The term "Old Derbeians" once meant only former pupils of Derby School, but the Old Derbeians Society is now open also to ex-pupils of the new school, who are called both New and Old Derbeians.

Ada Falcón

Ada Falcón (17 August 1905 – January 4, 2002) was an Argentine tango dancer, singer and film actress of the 1920s and 1930s. She starred in the film "Idolos de la radio" in 1934. She was famous for her tango work and made over 200 recordings in the 1920s and 1930s. She shared a long relationship with orchestra leader Francisco Canaro. She mysteriously disappeared from the limelight in 1942 and lived as a recluse until she died in 2002 at age 96.
Early life.
Falcón was born in Buenos Aires in 1905 where she started to act in theater as a little girl (11 years old), known as "la joyita Argentina" (the little Argentinian jewel). At age 13 she took part in her first movie "El festin de los Caranchos" in 1918.
She worked in numerous musical shows and also as an actress in theater and movies. In 1925 she made her first tango recordings as a soloist with the orchestra of Osvaldo Fresedo for Victor Records.
Falcón was a mezzo-soprano, an unusual register for tango singers at the time, who generally were sopranos.
She became famous singing with the orchestra of Francisco Canaro. Between 1930 and 1942 she was at the high point of her artistic life, when she made more than 200 recordings and became very wealthy.
Personal life.
After she became wealthy, Falcón enjoyed luxury, furs, expensive jewelry and fame. She lived in a beautiful three story house in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Palermo.
She had a turbulent romantic relationship with Canaro.
Seclusion.
In 1942 Falcón suddenly withdrew from public life and remained isolated in her house, avoiding contact with the outside world. She occasionally left the house to go to mass dressed entirely in black, her face covered by a net or by sunglasses, wearing a white turban and white gloves.
The cause of this withdrawal is a mystery; she never talked about it. Speculation that love disappointments with Canaro could have been an important element was never confirmed.
After a while she became a "tertiary nun" and entered an isolated convent in the hills of Córdoba Province. There she lived as a pauper by her own choice, in a small cell with little furniture and frugal meals, until she was transferred at an advanced age to a retirement home due to failing health.
She died in 2002 and is buried in the mausoleum dedicated to famous artists in Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires.
Life documentary.
Filmmakers Lorena Munoz and Sergio Wolf made a documentary about Falcón's life, titled "Yo no sé qué me han hecho tus ojos (I Don't Know What Your Eyes Have Done to Me)", which was released in 2003. Although she had not allowed her picture to be taken in nearly 60 years and rarely gave interviews, she allowed the filmmakers to film an interview with her shortly before her death.

Nordic Football Championship

The Nordic Football Championship (, , , , commonly abbreviated NM or PM) was an international football competition contested by the men's national football teams of the Nordic countries. In the first tournament played 1924–1928, only Denmark, Norway and Sweden competed, but Finland joined for the second tournament, and at the last tournament played in 2000–2001, Iceland and the Faroe Islands also competed.
History.
The tournament was created on Danish initiative to replace a contract, ended in 1919, between the Danish (DBU), Norwegian (NFF) and Swedish Football Association (SvFF) that stated that the national teams of the three associations should play two annual matches against each other. However the idea was not realised until four years later, when the Danish association celebrated its 35th anniversary, and the first tournament was started. It was arranged by the DBU and was played as a single group where the three teams met each other five times for a total of ten matches each. DBU also provided the trophy of the first edition, a trophy that Denmark won when the tournament ended in 1928.
The second tournament was arranged by SvFF that celebrated its 25th anniversary, and this time the Football Association of Finland (SPF) was invited. It was also decided to play the tournaments over four years, with each team playing 12 matches, four against each other team, two at home and two away. The tournament was won by Norway, but the following nine tournaments, played between 1933 and 1977, were completely dominated by Sweden which won all of them. The fourth tournament was interrupted by the Second World War, and thus was played over eleven years, from 1937 to 1947.
The tournament gained popularity after the war and the matches were important for the Nordic national teams as preparation for larger tournaments such as the World Cup and the Olympics. But the tournament lost significance in the 1970s, partially due to the increased number of matches played against other international opponents, and thus the last three tournaments played in the 1970s and 1980s varied in length and format. The last match of the 1981–1983 tournament, between Sweden and Norway, was not even played as Denmark had already won. But the match was then played in 1985 after all.
A non-recurrent edition of the tournament was played in 2000–01, to which the Football Association of Iceland and the Faroe Islands Football Association were invited. Some of the matches were played during a joint training camp in La Manga, Spain, and the rest were played at home, some in indoor arenas. One match, between Norway and the Faroe Islands, was never played.

San Salvatore in Lauro

San Salvatore in Lauro (St. Salvatore at the Laurels) is a Catholic church in central Rome, Italy. It is located on a piazza of the same name in the rione Ponte, it stands on Via Vechiarelli, just south of the Lungotevere Tor di Nona. Within Rome, the church is also known as St. Jesus. It is the "national church" of the "marchigiani", the inhabitants of the Marche region of Italy (the population of each Italy's region was counted as "nation" before Italian unification). The current Cardinal-Protector is Angelo Comastri.
The first church at the site dates to the 11th century; while the present building was constructed in the 16th century on designs of the Bolognese Ottaviano Mascherino.
The main altarpiece and cupola are painted by Ludovico Rusconi Sassi. In the chapels are works of art by Antoniazzo Romano, Camillo Rusconi, François Duquesnoy, Alessandro Turchi and a "Nativity" by Pietro da Cortona. The refectory has a series of Mannerist frescoes (1550) by Francesco Salviati (1550), and contains the 15th century tomb of Pope Eugene IV by Isaia da Pisa, transferred here from the Old Saint Peter's Basilica. Parmigianino's "Vision of Saint Jerome" was commissioned for a chapel in the church, but was later brought away by the donors and is now in the National Gallery, London.
The titular church was first established in 1587 as a Cardinal-Priest title but was suppressed in 1670. In the consistory of 24 November 2007 Pope Benedict XVI restored the church as a Cardinal Deaconry.

JSD Band

The JSD Band was an influential Scottish-based celtic and folk rock band primarily active from 1969 to 1974 and then again briefly from 1997 to 1998. The band released five full-length albums, and numerous singles and special releases, many of which are still sought after by collectors from around the world.
The band.
The JSD Band formed in 1969 and derived its name from the first letter of the first name of each of its three founding members: Jim Divers, Sean O’Rourke, and Des Coffield. Chuck Fleming and Colin Finn also joined the group rounding out the five-member lineup. Additionally, fiddle player Lindsay Scott temporarily filled in for Chuck Fleming in 1972. 
Initially, the band played the folk-club circuit with other artists such as Billy Connolly and Gerry Rafferty of the Humblebums and Barbara Dickson. After getting noticed for their lively electric-rock approach to traditional Scottish folk music when they won the Scottish Folk Group Championships at Edinburgh's Usher Hall, they made appearances on BBC Radio 1 with DJ John Peel and on BBC Two's "Old Grey Whistle Test" hosted by "Whispering" Bob Harris. In 1972, they were invited to be the support band for David Bowie during his UK-leg of the Ziggy Stardust Tour.
In 1971, the JSD Band released its first album entitled "Country of the Blind" on the Regal Zonophone label. Two albums on Cube Records would follow: "Black Album" (1972) and "Travelling Days" (1973).
Following the release of 1973's album, "Travelling Days", the group issued three singles: "Sarah Jane/Paddy Stacks" (1973), "Sunshine Life For Me (Sail Away Raymond)/Reel Call" (1974), and "Hayes and Harlington Blues/Cuckoo" (1974). In July 1974, pressure from various sources took its toll and the band disbanded.
The JSD Band reunited for a short stint from 1997 to 1998 and released two additional albums on KRL Records (a Glasgow-based label specialising in Scottish traditional music): 1997's "For the Record" which consisted of newly recorded acoustic versions of previously released material and 1998's "Pastures of Plenty" which consisted of new material featuring long-time friend of the group, Rob Mairs, on five-string banjo.
Recently - 2013- been playing again with all the original members and Rob Mairs guesting.

Culture (US band)

Culture was a Florida-based vegan/straight edge hardcore band. They formed in 1992, and lasted until 1998, when Damien Moyal merged the remaining members into the second incarnation of As Friends Rust.
History.
Rich Thurston formed the band in 1992 with Stan Obal on bass, Josh Williams on drums, and Mark Mitchell on vocals. Mark left in late 1993, and Rich assumed vocals. The trio recorded a four-song Demo and quickly got signed to release a self-titled 7" on Shadow Records. Before the release, John Wylie joined on second guitar, and was credited in the line-up. Shortly after, Stan was replaced by Peter Carreno. Pete was then replaced by Gordon Tarpley, and Damien Moyal joined to relieve Rich of vocals. The five piece went in studio to record multiple versions of songs that would be selected to be released on Born of You and on the Split with Roosevelt. Damien left in 1995, leaving the band to have short stints with vocalists Jeremy Haynes and Louie Long for touring purposes. After the return of supporting the releases, Mark Mitchell returned to front the band, and creative tensions with John Wylie resulted in his starting his own band, Morning Again (the band would mostly be constructed of musicians that had been in Culture, or that would in the future switch to become Culture members), letting Steve Looker take his position. The new line-up recorded Deforestation, and went back on tour.
In late 1996, original drummer Josh Williams left and was replaced by Jason Dooley, and Damien, who had been asked to leave Morning Again, returned to Culture. This line-up started writing new material right away. The first of which was a re-recording session of selected Born of You songs, as well as two new songs. The band was approached by Sean Bonner who ran Toybox Records to tour with them, and possibly release records of their material. The band continued to write more material, that would be released on a split with Kindred and on Heteronome. The songs from the session of Born of You only made it to test press of "Mike Warden Can Suck It". A year later, Rich, the only remaining founding member, left the band, moving Gordon to switch to guitar, Floyd Beckham to take over bass, and Timothy Kirkpatrick to join on drums. Very shortly after, Steve Looker and Joe Simmons traded positions in Morning Again and Culture, respectively. The band was to go to Europe for what would be their final tour, but Gordon could not make it, so Kenneth Brian temporarily joined as second guitarist. At one point or another, every resident of Gainesville, FL was a member of Culture.
Most of the final line-up, Damien, Joe, Gordon and Tim, followed Damien in his reincarnation of As Friends Rust.

Black Obelisk (band)

Black Obelisk (, "Chorny Obelisk") is a Russian heavy metal band founded in 1986 by bassist Anatoly Krupnov, who died in 1997. Different works and eras of band waved its style between hard rock and thrash metal.
History.
Original lineup: Anatoly Krupnov (bass, vocals), Yuri Anisimov (guitar) Mikhail Svetlov (guitar), and Nikolay Agafoshkin (drums). After their first performance, they joined Moscow Rock-Lab. Svetlov was soon replaced with Yuri Alexeyev. With Alexeyev, band released tape album "Apocalypsis" (1987). Svetlov rejoined ChO next year, replacing Anisimov, and participated in the following album "Tsveti Zla" (Flowers of Evil). The second album was more successful, and popularity of the band has grown. Black Obelisk participated in "Moskovskij Komsomolets"' yearly festival "Sound Track". But the continual alcohol abuse of Krupnov has led the band to the collapse in 1988, after the fighting accident in Chişinău.
Black Obelisk reunited August 1, 1990. Experiented Sergey Komarov became the new drummer, and Svetlov was soon replaced by Vasily Biloshitsky. But the recording of new album was suddenly halted after Komarov was shot to death by criminals. With Vladimir Yermakov as drummer, band recorded its third LP "Stena" (the Wall), and drives the tour supporting it.
Next year the album "One More Day" with English lyrics came out. The Russian version of the album was released in 1992, following many lineup changes: Biloshitsky was replaced by Zhirnov, and then by Dmitry Borisenkov. Black Obelisk toured together with Sepultura and Master. 1994's album "Ya Ostayus" (I Will Stay) was the last album of the classical lineup: Krupnov's alcohol and drugs addiction again triggered the band's crisis. In 1996 Alexeyev leaves to E.S.T., and then Black Obelisk stops its activity. Krupnov tried to reunite the band once again, but died February 27, 1997 in studio from heroin overdose, during the record session.
The history of Black Obelisk continued in 1999, when Borisenkov, Yermakov and Svetlov reunited under the old name. Borisenkov became the vocalist and main songwriter. Daniil Zakharenkov became the band's new bass player. In 2000 the album, recording of which was started back in 1996, was completed and released to public under the name "Postalbum".
Black Obelisk is still active, though new lineup led to stilistic changes and less "anarchistic" lyrics in following albums "Pepel" (Ashes), "Nervi" (Nerves) and "Zeleny Albom" (Green Album), written by Borisenkov. Dmitry also participated in Elven Manuscript metal opera by Epidemia in the role of Deimos the dark lord.
In 2009, they released "Черное Белое" (Black & White) internet-single, also putting the songs "Черное-Белое" (Black & White), "Вальс" (Waltz), "Исход" (Exodus), and "Прощай и прости" (Farewell & Forgive) for free download on their official website.

Internet Resource Locator

Internet resource locators, described in RFC 1736, convey location and access information for resources. Typical examples of resources include network accessible documents, WAIS databases, FTP servers, and Telnet destinations.
Locators may apply to resources that are not always or not ever network accessible. Examples of the latter include human beings and physical objects that have no electronic instantiation (that is, objects without an existence completely defined by digital objects such as disk files).
A resource locator is a kind of resource identifier. Other kinds of resource identifiers allow names and descriptions to be associated with resources. A resource name is intended to provide a stable handle to refer to a resource long after the resource itself has moved or perhaps gone out of existence. A resource description comprises a body of meta-information to assist resource search and selection.
An Internet resource locator is a locator defined by an Internet resource location standard. A resource location standard in conjunction with resource description and resource naming standards specifies a comprehensive infrastructure for network based information dissemination. Mechanisms for mapping between locators, names, and descriptive identifiers.
Network-based information resource providers require a method of describing the location of and access to their resources. Information systems users require a method whereby client software can interpret resource access and location descriptions on their behalf in a relatively transparent way. Without such a method, transparent and widely distributed, open information access on the Internet would be difficult if not impossible.

Donald Chisholm

Donald Chisholm (1822 – April 5, 1890), also known as "Doc" Chisholm, was a Canadian Member of Parliament from British Columbia, representing the riding of New Westminster.
Chisholm was born in valley of the Lower South River near Antigonish, Nova Scotia, of parents who had migrated there from Inverness-shire, Scotland. He was educated there and became a teacher, but in 1849 he started out for the California Gold Rush with 23 other prospectors. In California, he took part in the evolution of that state's mining laws, but had little success in the goldfields but also practiced medicine, and is credited with rescuing the lives of many miners (his medical skills were later of use during a cholera epidemic in British Columbia). Staying in California only a few years, he returned to Canada and became involved in the wheat trade in Ontario. Speculating on wheat prices during the Crimean War, Chisholm was left holding thousands of bushels at the time of the declaration of a peace, incurring the loss of a small fortune had the peace come only a few more weeks later. 
In the wake of this experience, he migrated to British Columbia in 1858 and became involved in many different businesses, settling in Hope, British Columbia. Possessed of "herculean strength" and standing 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm) tall, and reputedly the strongest man in the Colony, he was appointed a constable during the McGowan's War and in 1860 he was elected by the people of Hope to a convention in New Westminster, the purpose of which was to frame and present an appeal to the Imperial Government to introduce proper government for the Mainland Colony, which was then still ruled near-entirely by Governor James Douglas (a Legislative Assembly for the Colony would not be created until 1864, after Douglas' retirement).
Chisholm was among the first parties to travel to the Big Bend Gold Rush in 1860, nearly losing his life when a snow bridge gave way as he was crossing McCullough Creek and he was swept away, then rescued, unconscious, by a party of miners half a mile downstream. In 1862 he went to the Cariboo Gold Rush and spent a few years there before moving to the Kootenay district to engage in both lumbering and mining, serving for a time as foreman for the Cherry Creek silver mine. During this period Chisholm was engaged to lead the partyof Major-General Selby Smyth, militia commander of Canada, and his staff through the mountains from Alberta to Hope.
In 1874 he moved to New Westminster and became wealthy through investing in the wholesale and retail liquor business and also a flour and feed business of a Mr. Fred Woodcock, and was President of the New Westminster Board of Trade for several years. He also launched a hotel and store at Ladner (then Ladner's Landing), later owned by Thomas NcNeely, and was also a partner in the Delta Canning Company, one of the large canneries then a mainstay of economic life in the province. Other property holdings included land in what is now the Grandview area of Vancouver, and at Hastings (New Brighton), as well as holdings in the centre of the City of New Westminster and also, in partnership with a Mr. Daniel Mills was co-owner of a large farm on Saltspring Island. 
Chisholm was first elected to office in the 1887 general election, representing the New Westminster riding as a Liberal-Conservative supporting Sir John A. Macdonald, and died in office on April 5, 1890.

Frogs (video game)

Frogs is a single-player action / platform arcade game released by Sega-Gremlin in 1978. It is the first video game with a jumping character (predating "Donkey Kong" by 3 years), which by some definitions could make it the first platform game. The player controls a frog on lilypads and attempts to catch (with the frog's tongue and while jumping) various insects (butterflies and dragonflies) worth different amounts of points in a set amount of time.
"Frogs" is one of the first arcade games (if not "the" first arcade game) to include a static background as part of the arcade cabinet. The game’s graphics were "projected" by laying the monitor flat on its back and reflecting the computer-generated graphics of the frogs and flies toward the player via a mirror at a 45-degree angle. (The game’s graphics were actually generated and shown backward, so the mirror reflection would show letters and numbers properly.)

Shakalaka Boom Boom

Shakalaka Boom Boom is a 2007 Bollywood musical thriller film directed and produced by Suneel Darshan and written by Anurag Kashyap. The film stars Bobby Deol, Upen Patel, Celina Jaitley and Kangna Ranaut in the lead. It released on 6 April 2007.
"Shakalaka Boom Boom" is based on conflicts and the power game involved in the functioning of the music industry. The film was partly shot in South Africa. Upon release the film was panned by critics and flopped at the box office, though the acting of newcomer Upen Patel was very praised, as well as Bobby Deol's role as a first-time villain. The movie worked for the musical fans.
Plot summary.
"Shakalaka Boom Boom" follows the tale of a jealous, selfish and greedy music artist, AJ (Bobby Deol). AJ is one of the finest music artists in the industry, and is currently under a stop since he can't think of a new project. AJ is in love with the hot and sexy Ruhi (Kangna Ranaut) and hopes to tell her how he feels however a wannabe singer, Reggie (Upen Patel) appears who falls in love with Ruhi and woos her before AJ can. 
Therefore, AJ swears to destroy Reggie's career, and hence comes into Reggie's life as his friend. Getting him drunk, getting him smoking, is all that AJ has been doing to Reggie, and Reggie even loses control and passes out. One day, AJ finds out all Reggie's secrets, and gets him so drunk that he has liver-fail. Reggie in the state of dying, AJ takes all his music-notes and beats, and flees from the place. Then Ruhi shows up and takes him to the hospital. He is placed into the operation section duet to the failure of his liver, and then onwards, Ruhi plans to destroy AJ's career just like he did to Reggie.
Though, Ruhi does not know that AJ isn't alone, he also has his hidden agenda with Reggie's ex-girlfriend Sheena (Celina Jaitley) who is now a bigshot due to AJ. AJ and Sheena together publish Reggie's music at their own, and it goes onto becoming a big hit. At the music-signing, Ruhi gets her gun out, though it doesn't seem to work. She seems that's it, though Karma has a different plan in mind. Due to her gun not working, she leaves and as she leaves, a disco ball randomly falls on top of AJ's head. He is placed into the hospital, and the doctor declares him as he is now deaf, and can't hear any music anymore. The ending shows him going to hell, and Reggie waking up to a better life, as he and Ruhi have now proved that the music is really his.
Box office.
Because it had a controlled budget the film didn't do too badly but only grossed about 4.5 crores in the first week and its total net gross was 6 crores altogether. "Boxoffice-india" declared the film a flop.
Reception.
Critical reception.
"Shakalaka Boom Boom" attracted negative reviews from top critics of India. Mayank Shekhar of "Hindustan Times" rated the film with 1 out of 5 stars. Shakti Salgaokar of DNA gave movie a one and half stars and wrote in his review, "It's simple — sexual innuendo, potshots at popular films, bad mimicry, foreign locations, a generous dose of overacting, an item song and a gora villain. And as he magnificently presents the climax of the film. Spare us the comedy, please?" Nikhat Kazmi of "Times of India" said, "This one's definitely not for the fastidious, choosy viewer but for those who don't mind losing it for a bit, "Shakalaka Boom Boom" works like an average Bollywood musical. Performance-wise, it's one big circus with the guys hogging most of the limelight. The girls — Kangna and Celina — are mere confetti" and gave it 3 out of 5 stars. Taran Adarsh also gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying "It's a well-crafted entertainer and lives up to the expectations of its target audience — the youth. At the box-office, its business at the multiplexes will help it generate good revenue, making it a profitable proposition for its investors."

<doc id="9675496" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9675496" title="La Timba">
La Timba

La Timba is a strip of land located at the border of a cliff, between the neighbourhoods of "Covadonga" and "Nostra Llar" at the upper side, and the bottom of a precipice that gives place to the canyon at the bottom of which lie the river Ripoll and the neighbourhood of "Torre Romeu" at the lower side. It is located in Sabadell, in the shire of Vallès Occidental, Catalonia, Spain.
The term "La Timba": meaning, origin and usage.
Meaning.
The word "Timba" is a female short form of the male Catalan word "Estimbat" ("despeñado" in Spanish), the participle of the verb "Estimbar-se" ("despeñarse" in Spanish), meaning "to fall over a cliff" or a "precipice". And this applies when someone has "fallen over" an "Estimball", meaning "cliff" or "precipice". And since La Timba is located on a cliff, hence the name of the place.
Origin.
Due to the extremely local usage of the word, it is hard to find stated evidences of the term. However, it is very likely that the term was originated at the mid 20th century, when the adjacent lands to the precipice began to be inhabited by both local peoples and immigrants from the southern Spain because the city centre of Sabadell began to be small for the newcomers.
Usage.
The usage of the term is extremely scarce and the word is only known by the very few people whose lives have been linked with the neighbourhood of "Covadonga" and "Nostra Llar" all their lives, and even the people living a few blocks away the Timba do not know what the word means. When these very few people die, or the speculation reaches this small and tranquil piece of land, located on a precipice between the neighbourhoods of "Covadonga" and "Nostra Llar", and the outskirts adjacent to the Ripoll, the term will probably disappear. It is a clear example of moribund term.
Geography.
La Timba has a distance of about 2 km, starting next to the UAB Computer Science and Business faculty, where the "Tres Creus" road bifurcates into the "Santiga" street and then goes down the canyon while the "Santiga street" (which is then followed by the "Ronda d'Orient" street, and the "Egara" Avenue in the neighbourhood of "Nostra Llar") follows it from the upper side of the precipice, and the "Sant Oleguer" neighbourhood. The strip of land that remains between the road that goes down the canyon (the "Tres Creus" road) and the street that follows that road from the upper side of the precipice (the "Santiga" street and then the "Ronda d'Orient" street in the "Covadonga" neighbourhood, and then the "Egara" Avenue in the "Nostra Llar" neighbourhood) is what is called La Timba by the locals.
History.
The adjacent lands to La Timba (the upper side of the precipice that gives place to the canyon at the bottom of which lies the Ripoll river), began to be inhabited by both local peoples and immigrants from the Southern Spain in the beginnings of the 20th century. By those times, the city centre of Sabadell could not host more newcomers so the city radius started an unstoppable expansion that, few tens later, would reach the Ripoll river at the bottom of the canyon, with the creation of the "Torre Romeu" neighbourhood. In some cases, the immigrants from the Southern Spain lived in caves in the Timba, as they had nowhere else to stay.
With the time, the local peoples began to cultivate Orchards and breed small farm animals (such as chickens, ducks and rabbits) on the strip between the "Covadonga" neighbourhood and the precipice. Because there are just a few metres between the houses and the precipice, the orchards began to descend the precipice to the point that, nowadays, the cliff is filled with them.
At the mid 1990s, the local police of Sabadell closed the fence that separates the upper side of the precipice and the slope, and the activity in "La Timba" stopped. During this happening, some acts of plundering were committed by locals in the abandoned orchards.
Nowadays, the orchards of the slope of the cliff are abandoned, and the upper side of the precipice is a green corridor which width varies from a half-metre to not more than 20 m.

Neal Macrossan

Neal William Macrossan (1889–1955) was a lawyer, judge and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland.
Early years.
Macrossan was born on 27 April 1889 at Lutwyche in Queensland. He was the eighth and youngest child of Australian politician John Murtagh Macrossan and Bridget Macrossan (née Queely). He was educated at the Normal School in Brisbane. There he won a scholarship and attended at St. Joseph's Nudgee College. In 1904 whilst studying at St Joseph’s, he was awarded the T J Byrnes medal for obtaining the highest pass mark in Queensland. In 1906 he again topped the State at the senior level. He also won a silver medal for Greek and was selected as the Rhodes scholar for Queensland in 1907.
Macrossan studied at Magdalen College, Oxford. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts with honours in 1910 and obtained a Master of Arts in 1914 from Oxford. The University of Queensland awarded him a Bachelor of Arts Ad Eundem Gradum on 1 June 1911 to mark the occasion of the founding of the University of Queensland, although the Queensland Supreme Court Library notes it as a Masters of Arts. 
On his return to Queensland, he obtained employment in the Queensland Crown Solicitor’s Office. He passed the Barristers’ Board admission examination and he was called to the Bar on 27 August 1912. He unsuccessfully stood for election to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in 1915 for the seat of Cairns, where he stood as a candidate for the Liberal Party. In Brisbane he married Eileen Elizabeth Beirne on 14 December 1921. 
He purchased Glen Alpine in 1931 in Toowoomba. Glen Alpine had the first domestic swimming pool built in the Toowoomba area. The house and gardens are now heritage classified by the Queensland Government.
Macrossan represented ex-premier William McCormack in the Mungana Mines case. McCormack was tried with ex-treasurer Ted Theodore and two others. The case was instituted following a Royal Commission on 4 July 1930 in the purchase of the mines. The royal commission had made a finding that all the accused had acted dishonestly in the purchase of the mine. The conspiracy case commenced in the Supreme Court on 22 July 1931 and resulted in a jury verdict in favour of McCormack and Theodore on 25 August. 
Macrossan also appeared in the Constitutional case of Peanut Board v. Rockhampton Harbour Board heard in the High Court of Australia. The case concerned whether the Queensland Government could control peanut sales in Queensland through the Peanut Board. Macrossan appeared as junior for the Board. He was unsuccessful in arguing against the marketing law and the law was held to be unconstitutional. 
Macrossan lectured at the University of Queensland on Pleading and Practice until his appointment to the bench. He also established an endowment to the University for the Macrossan lectures.
Judicial appointment.
Macrossan was appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court on 29 June 1940. He was appointed senior puisne judge five days later in front of more senior judges. Macrossan acted as chief justice on two occasions, before being appointed to the office on 25 April 1946. He became the second son to be appointed to that office following in the steps of his brother Hugh Denis Macrossan. 
As chief justice in 1947, one of the early cases heard by Macrossan at first instance was a matter concerning the dispute over the purchase of a lottery ticket. The defendants had won £6000 in a “Golden Casket” Lottery. The plaintiff claimed that the ticket was purchased in a syndicate of three, being himself and the two defendants. The case turned on the credibility of the plaintiff and the jury found in the plaintiff’s favour. Macrossan awarded £2000 to the plaintiff. The publicity surrounding the case caused lottery agents to come forward and produce new evidence that showed that the plaintiff couldn’t have entered into a syndicate on the date he stated, as the tickets hadn’t been printed before that date. An appeal to the High Court seeking to overturn that decision was unsuccessful and Macrossan’s decision stood.
In 1954 his wife Eileen died. She is buried in Nudgee Cemetery.
In 1955 Macrossan heard an appeal from a decision of the Objectionable Literature Board. The board had classified books bearing titles such as “"Real Love"”, “"Romance Story"” and “"Darling Romance"” as “objectionable” material. Macrossan described the publications as emphasising “the thesis that an acceptable means of achieving this ideal marriage is a casual acquaintance made by a young girl with a man hitherto a complete stranger to her the ardour of whose embraces and kisses provides the assurance of the constancy of his affection". The court found that the materials was “what they considered to be a tendency to corrupt members of an age group of females described as unstable adolescents.” However on appeal to the High Court, a majority ruling overturned the decision.
Macrossan was a warden of the council of the University of Queensland, president of the Playground (and Recreation) Association of Queensland, president of the Twelfth Night Theatre Company, and also President of the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland.
He died on 30 December 1955 in South Brisbane and had a state funeral. He is buried in Nudgee cemetery.
His older brother Hugh Denis Macrossan was also a chief justice of Queensland as well as his nephew John Murtagh Macrossan (son of Macrossan's brother Vincent).

Charles of Mount Argus

Charles of Mount Argus, C.P. (11 December 1821 – January 1893), was a Dutch Passionist priest who served in 19th-century Ireland. He gained a reputation for his compassion for the sick and those in need of guidance. His reputation for healings was so great at the time that a reference is made to him in the famous novel "Ulysses" by James Joyce. He has been canonized by the Catholic Church.
Life.
He was born Joannes Andreas Houben on 11 December 1821 in the village of Munstergeleen in the Province of Limburg in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, to Peter Joseph Houben and his wife, Johanna Elizabeth Luyten. He was named after his maternal uncle and godfather, but to the family he was known as Andrew. His father was a miller by trade. As a boy Andrew attended the village primary school. One of 11 children in a poor family, he was a slow learner in his youth. To those outside his family he seemed quiet and extremely shy.
When Houben was 19 years old he was enrolled for military service in the First Infantry Regiment of the Netherlands. It is said that on occasion during his time as a soldier there was a disturbance in the town; the army were called out and ordered to fire. Afraid that he might hit someone, Andrew pointed his rifle the wrong way and narrowly missed shooting his superior officer. On 18 February 1845 his period as a reserve in the army came to an end and he was formally discharged.
Passionist.
Feeling called to religious life, in 1845 Houben was admitted to the novitiate of the Passionists, who had recently arrived in Belgium, in the village of Ere, near Tournai. He professed his religious vows the following year and was given the religious habit and the religious name of Charles of St. Andrew. His father died in 1850, just before Charles' ordination as a priest. The family were so poor they could not afford to go to his ordination because of the expenses of the funeral. Even happy days were lonely days. He was sent to serve in England in 1852. He did parochial ministry in the Parish of St. Wilfred and neighboring areas. Serving there, Charles first came in contact with the Irish who were moving to England in the wake of the devastating famine taking place there. 
In July 1857 Charles was transferred to Ireland to the newly founded monastery of Mount Argus, in Harold's Cross, Dublin. Traditionally Passionists are supposed to conduct missions and retreats and, through preaching, spread devotion to the Passion of Christ. Charles was not a good preacher. He never really mastered the English language, but it was in the confessional and in comforting the sick that he excelled, and he became fond of the Irish people. In community he was cheerful and often was heard humming the Dutch national anthem as he walked around the house.
Healer.
It was Charles' gift of healing the sick which is most clearly remembered. Another member of the Passionist community in Dublin, Sebastian Keens, C.P., told of a 12-year old boy who had lost the use of his leg and was brought to him. Without delay he called Charles and shortly afterwards found the boy walking up and down in front of the house completely cured. He became so popular with the people that the diocesan authorities, as well as the medical profession, grew suspicious of him. Some medical doctors complained to Cardinal Cullen, the Archbishop of Dublin, that he discouraged people from going to the doctor, a claim later retracted. Unscrupulous persons took holy water blessed by Charles and unbeknownst to him began to sell it throughout Ireland. In order to discourage this practice, Charles was transferred back to England in 1866 and remained there for eight years.
Charles returned to Dublin in 1874 where he remained until his death that took place at dawn on 5 January 1893.
Veneration.
At his funeral, attended by people from all of Ireland, there was definite proof of the popular devotion that had surrounded him throughout his life. The Superior of the monastery wrote to his family: "The people have already declared him a saint." 
The cause for Charles' canonization was introduced on 13 November 1935. After the declaration of a miracle attributed to his intercession, on 16 October 1988, Pope John Paul II beatified the man whom everyone called the Saint of Mount Argus. The miracle that led to his canonization was the healing of Adolf Dormans of Munstergeleen, Charles' birthplace, who was cured of "perforated, gangrenous appendicitis with generalized peritonitis that was multi-organically compromising" and which cure was "not scientifically explainable". The theologian consultors and the Ordinary Congregation of Cardinals and Bishops gave their unanimous approval of the claimed supernatural aspect of the said alleged healing. Charles was canonized on 3 June 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI.

Lydbury North

Lydbury North is a village and a geographically large civil parish in south Shropshire, England. It is locally called Lydbury and there is no settlement of "Lydbury South" or similar. It is located at . 
It is situated in the south west corner of the county, near to the small towns of Clun and Bishop's Castle. The B4385 road runs through the village, as does the Jack Mytton Way. To the west is the village and parish of Colebatch. There is a post office, school and church here. Also there is a public house called the "Powis Arms".
According to the Institute for Name Studies the name is Old English in derivation and means 'Fortification on the *Hlyde (= noisy stream)', perhaps an early name for the River Kemp.
The village lies between 155 and 165 metres above sea level. Whilst the land to the south is flat, to the north the land rises steeply. 
Priors Holt, Priors Holt Hill and Churchmoor are at the northeastern extremities of the parish, the church of which in Lydbury North, St Michael and All Angels, contains a small Catholic chapel.
Walcot Hall.
Walcot Hall is a Georgian country house to the south of the village. An original Elizabethan manor house was remodelled in 1764 by Sir William Chambers for Clive of India, who had bought the estate from Charles Walcot. It is constructed in two storeys of red brick with a slate roof to an irregular U-shaped floor plan
Walcot Pool, a large body of water which is part of the estate, was created by French prisoners of war during the Napoleonic War. From 1929 to the Second World War the estate was a bird sanctuary.
Since 1957 it has been owned by the Parish family and used for weddings, corporate hospitality and accommodation.

Treaty Room

The Treaty Room is located on the second floor of the White House, the official residence of the President of the United States. The room is a part of the first family's private apartments and is used as a study by the president.
Before construction of the West Wing of the White House, working offices were located on the east side of the second floor. The Treaty Room has been used as a waiting room, a cabinet room, and the president's office. President Andrew Johnson used the room for his cabinet meetings. Ulysses S. Grant continued this use and acquired a large Renaissance Revival style table to be used by his cabinet. The table remained in the room for many years, and President William McKinley oversaw the signing of the peace treaty with Spain which concluded the Spanish-American War on it on August 12, 1898.
Old engravings, photographs and stereographs show a succession of ornate printed wall and ceiling papers, highly figured axminster carpets, and ornate gas lighting fixtures. During the administration of Theodore Roosevelt this room was greatly simplified as a part of an overall refurbishment of the house directed by Charles Follen McKim. Victorian decoration was removed, and the underlying wood floor was exposed. Low bookcases were constructed, and the room began use as the president's in-residence study.
During the administration of Herbert Hoover, the room was used as a parlor or sitting room and was termed the Monroe Room. James Monroe's French Empire center table was moved to the room, and a copy of the desk he signed the Monroe Doctrine upon was placed in the room. Additional efforts were made during the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt to furnish the room somewhat as it might have been when the house was built. Following the Truman reconstruction of the White House, the room was furnished by the interior design department of the New York department store B. Altman and Company. Nearly all the furniture was contemporary, generally in a traditional style.
During the administration of John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy worked with Stéphane Boudin of the House of Jansen to create a room that would represent a part of the house's Victorian era history. A palette of deep greens, burgundy and gold was adopted. President Grant's table was returned to the room along with an electrified gas chandelier once located in the East Room. The walls recreated a mid-nineteenth century treatment of ornamental frames of decorative paper based on the wallpaper in the room Abraham Lincoln was taken to and died in, in a house opposite Ford's Theater. A large gilded Rococo Revival overmantel mirror, with an American shield, which had once been hung in the Green Room was installed. Theobald Chartran's painting "Signing of the Peace Protocol Between Spain and the United States, August 12, 1898" was hung in the room along with copies of several treaties signed at the White House. Drapery was based on a design of Lincoln's era. President Kennedy signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the room in 1963. Boudin's design survived into the administration of George H. W. Bush who had the room painted a light green and simple printed chintz curtains installed.
During the administration of Bill Clinton interior designer Kaki Hockersmith furnished the room in a mix of late American Empire and Victorian. Walls were covered with a simulated leather of a deep claret red and a gilded chandelier with an American eagle, one of several purchased during Theodore Roosevelt's administration for the residence and West Wing, was hung.
During the administration of George W. Bush, interior designer Ken Blasingame had the walls painted off-white, replaced the Clinton drapery with simple panels of olive green velvet hung on wooden poles, and replaced the Empire style chandelier with an electrified Victorian crystal gasolier. The Treaty Room has also been home to "The Peacemakers", a large oil painting depicting President Lincoln in the final months of the Civil War.
President Bush addressed the nation from the Treaty Room on October 7, 2001, announcing that the War in Afghanistan had begun. In his memoirs "Decision Points", Bush referred to the Treaty Room as "...one of my favorite places in the White House."
President Barack Obama uses the Treaty Room as one of his primary working offices.

Codroy Valley

The Codroy Valley is a valley in the southwestern part of the island of Newfoundland in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
The Codroy Valley is a glacial valley formed in the Anguille Mountains, a sub-range of the Long Range Mountains which run along Newfoundland's west coast fronting the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The valley runs inland at a perpendicular angle from the coast along a bearing of 45° (northeast), carrying the Codroy River and its tributaries to the gulf.
The mouth of the Codroy Valley at the coast is extremely windy and is the location of Wreckhouse, so-named by employees of the historic Newfoundland Railway for the wind's ability to blow railway cars off the tracks.

<doc id="9675579" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9675579" title="Series commander">
Series commander

The Series Commander is a United States Marine Corps officer assigned to a Recruit Training Company who is responsible for the conduct and instruction of Marine recruits and Marine Corps Drill Instructors within one of the two series, lead or follow. Series Commanders are typically of the rank of First Lieutenant (O-2) or captain (O-3), and they are assisted in their duties by a Series Chief Drill Instructor (MCRD San Diego) or a Series Gunnery Sergeant (MCRD Parris Island).
The Series Commander is primarily charged with supervision and safety during recruit training. Before a recruit is allowed to run the Obstacle Course or the Confidence Course, the Series Commander must run the course first and check each obstacle for any unsafe conditions. The Series Commander will then oversee his Drill Instructors as they lead the recruits through the course. The Series Commander also serves as a verifying officer and safety officer during the Rifle Range, A-Line, Basic Warrior Training, and The Crucible.
Though Series Commanders do not train recruits in the same way as Drill Instructors do, they do conduct PT, lead conditioning hikes, conduct hygiene and uniform inspections, make on the spot corrections, and teach classes covering Marine Corps policies on Hazing, Fraternization, and Equal Opportunity. Additionally, the Combat Training Pool, Martial Arts Instructors, Academic Instruction Company, and Crucible Training Company are all commanded by former Series Commanders. A Recruit Training Battalion Operations Officer will most likely be a former Series and Company Commander from that Battalion.
The role was also created to provide another layer of authority to monitor more closely the individual drill instructors, as a result of the Ribbon Creek incident. Throughout the training cycle, every recruit is interviewed personally by the Series Commander to ensure their drill instructors have acted in accordance with the proper orders and policies. The purpose of these interviews is twofold; first, it allows individual recruits access to a commissioned officer, and second, it allows the Series Commander the opportunity to speak with each recruit in his series individually throughout the course of boot camp. Underlying the policy in the Standard Operating Procedures for Recruit Training against recruit abuse, recruit interviews are also used to ensure recruits are not physically or verbally abused by their drill instructors or any other personnel in the training command.

1979–80 British Home Championship

The 1979-80 British Home Championship saw only the second undisputed victory for Northern Ireland in the British Home Nations international football tournament in 96 years of existence. It was also the first time since 1970 that Scotland agreed to travel to Northern Ireland, having refused to play there since 1972. The tournament also finally marked the end of a decade of extremely poor international football results for all the Home Nations. Apart from disappointing Scottish performances in the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cups, no British side had been represented at a major football tournament since England were knocked out by Germany at the 1970 FIFA World Cup. In 1980, England finally qualified for the 1980 UEFA European Championship and although their performance was unspectacular it did lay the groundwork for the appearance of three of the Home Nations at the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain. The Home Championships thus allowed spectators and coaches an impression of the reorganised British sides and their capabilities in competitive football.
The opening matches provided two great shocks for the long-established favourites of England and Scotland, with a narrow Northern Irish home victory over the Scots and a Welsh 4–1 thrashing of the English, putting the underdogs in pole position going into their remaining rounds. Scotland recovered slightly with a narrow victory over the Welsh, but England could only manage a draw with the Northern Irish, who were in the best position to claim undisputed first place for 66 years. In the final matches, England salvaged pride and points with a win over the Scots taking them to second place, but the Northern Irish claimed the trophy by defeating Wales in Cardiff, celebrating their centenary with a rare triumph.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 58 was adopted on September 28, 1948. The Swiss Confederation had just joined the International Court of Justice (ICJ) but was not yet a member of the United Nations and the Council was asked to make recommendations. The Council recommended that Switzerland and any other state that should find itself in this position be allowed to participate in all the elements of the General Assembly pertaining to the ICJ including the nomination of new members, elections, etc. 
The Council also recommended that those nations would be required to pay dues contributing to the expenses of the Court and that should it fail to do so (unless that nation possessed an excuse deemed worthy by the General Assembly) it should not be allowed to participate in the Assembly in any way until the balance was paid. 
The President of the Council stated that the resolution was adopted unanimously in the absence of any objection by any of its members.

Cleaner

A cleaner is a type of industrial or domestic worker who cleans homes or commercial premises for payment. Unlike other servants, their primary task is cleaning. Cleaners may specialise in cleaning particular things or places, such as window cleaners. Cleaners often work when the people who otherwise occupy the space are not around. They may clean offices at night or houses during the workday.
The 2000 film "Bread and Roses" by British director Ken Loach depicted the struggle of cleaners in Los Angeles, California to fight for better pay and working conditions, and the right to join a union. In an interview with the BBC in 2001, Loach stated that thousands of cleaners from around 30 countries have since contacted him with tales similar to the one told in the film.

Exist Trace

Exist Trace (stylized as exist†trace) is a Japanese visual kei metal band, consisting entirely of female members. The members originate from Tokyo, and initially formed in June 2003. The founding members are Jyou, Naoto and Mally, who then advertised for guitarists, meeting miko and Omi.
To date, the band has released seven singles, four EPs, and a compilation album. They have also appeared on ten omnibus albums as well as two live DVDs featuring several bands on the Shizuoka-based Sequence Records label. Their highest charting is number 84 on the Oricon album chart for "Virgin".
Exist Trace made their U.S. debut at Sakura-Con 2011 in Seattle, Washington. On June 15, 2011 they released their major label debut on Tokuma Japan Communications, the EP "True".
Musical style and direction.
Exist Trace's early music can be described as melodic metal, with vocalist Jyou's growls and shouts throughout many songs, which contributes to their dark undertone. They have since added more complex sounds to the compositions, their guitar sound often featuring heavy distortion and technically virtuoso riffs and solos. The lyrics are mainly based on gothic themes, and their music style has resemblance to gothic rock. In recent work, they have experimented with different electronic and melodic approaches to their music, such as the jazz-influenced "Ginger", the electronic-rock of "Diamond" and the '80s disco' feel of "Spiral Daisakusen".
In 2013, Exist Trace introduced their 'new world' musical direction, where long-time main lyricist/ composer miko would officially be taking a dual-vocal position with Jyou. Miko's earliest shared vocal was on the track "Little Mary to utsukushiki nikushimi no Danube"(Little Mary and the beautiful hatred of the Danube), where she played the part of the sweet young Mary to counterbalance Jyou's deep-voiced rendition of her mother, the murderous queen. Following this, the 2012 track "Ginger" showed a 'call and response' style of duet, where the two act as a sort of Bonnie and Clyde couple of bickering thieves, whose shared passion for crime and each other is constantly tested by their own selfishness. The 'twin vocal' style was emphasised in 2013's single "Diamond", where the interactions between the two vocalists was less a meeting of two parts or characters, and more a case of shared lines and a harmony of chorus. In 2014's "Spiral Daisakusen", the pair again share front billing and the centre spot on the music video.
This direction created some controversy within the fandom, some criticising miko's less powerful vocal capabilities and claiming that Jyou's vocal parts were made less acrobatic in order to match. The twin vocal style necessitated a change in the band's sound, as it favoured clear harmonies over the previous style of raw, emotional vocals, interspersed with wordless sounds such as growls, screams or sighs. This has left many concerned about the future of the band's sound, and questions over how much of the change in the musical direction is owed to pressures from the Tokuma music label to appeal to a more mainstream audience.
A new album is slated for release in September 2014.
International Acclaim.
First introduced to the West by their inclusion on the Silent Hill soundtrack in 2007, the band developed a dedicated international following. Fans of Japanese rock and the visual kei genre in particular voted eagerly for the band to tour internationally, and were rewarded in 2008 when exist trace embarked on a tour of Europe, including the United Kingdom. Voices from the United States fandom encouraged the band to be booked for Japanese culture conventions, such as Tekkoshocon X in 2012, and AKON 2013.
Official Fanclub.
2014 brought the introduction of the band's official international fanclub, 'Archangel Diamond', to act as a supplement to the Japanese fanclub 'Vanguard'. The club became an active presence on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr, featuring fan artworks and responding to fan questions. It officially opened for membership on May 19, 2014, the 19th of each month being generally used for exist trace announcements as it is 'Igu day' -- a Japanese pun on the shortened form of the band's name.
Archangel Diamond promises to connect international fans more closely with the band, and will offer fanclub exclusive merchandise, as well as messages from the band members.

Russell Brookes

Russell Brookes (born 16 August 1945) is an English former rally driver. He won the British Rally Championship with a Ford Escort RS1800 in 1977 and with an Opel Manta 400 in 1985. In 1978, he won the Rally New Zealand, a round of the FIA Cup for Drivers, the predecessor to the World Championship for Drivers. In the World Rally Championship, he finished on the podium of his home event, the RAC Rally, three times in a row from 1977 to 1979.
Career.
Only son of a firefighter Brookes made his competitive debut in club events in 1963. At first he drove a number of privately entered cars including a BMC Mini Cooper. Progress was slow until 1973 without the support of family money in a sport which, at that time, did not permit sponsorship of individual cars. He then came to the attention of the Ford Motor Company when contesting their Ford Escort Mexico (One Make) championship. 
In 1974 Brookes started one of the longest running sponsorship deals in motorsport when he signed with "Andrews - Heat for Hire" (a portable heating and air conditioning company). Their distinctive yellow colour scheme graced nearly all of his cars through to 1991. During this period the sponsors' turnover grew from £1.5m to over £60m making it a benchmark for other sponsorship deals.
In 1976, Brookes was invited to join the Ford 'works' team to drive an Escort RS1800 in the British Rally Championship. At that time the British Championship was highly competitive having eclipsed the World Rally Championship for publicity. Brookes found himself in formidable company not least from within the team, Björn Waldegård, Hannu Mikkola and Ari Vatanen (all world champions), being his team-mates. He won the Open Championship in 1977 and then stayed with Ford until the end of the 1979 World Rally Championship season. 
Two years in the Talbot team followed before he joined Vauxhall/Opel dealer team, first in the Chevette HSR then the mighty Group B Opel Manta 400. The two years with the Opel Manta put Brookes head to head with his team mate Jimmy McRae (father of the late world champion Colin McRae). The needle match contest was more about the unofficial title of 'Top British Driver' than the championship itself. McRae won in 1984 and Brookes in 1985. The intensity of the contest lives in the memory of enthusiasts to this day. 
After a year in the uncompetitive Vauxhall Astra and a one off event in a 'works' Lancia Delta Integrale Brookes rejoined Ford in 1988 for an assault on the British Rally Championship, championing first a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth. Latterly he drove a Ford Sapphire Cosworth 4x4 giving Ford their first international win with the new four wheel drive car. Here he stayed until the end of 1991 when he more or less retired from competitive rallying. To this day though, he still makes sporadic appearances in various cars on historic rallies and at motorsports events. In September 2008, Brookes took part in the "Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally", a round of the Scottish Rally Championship centred in Perth in Scotland. He competed the event in a historic Ford Escort RS1600. He was one of a number of ex-world and British champions to take part in the event in memory of McRae, who died in 2007.

Chakobo language

Chácobo-Pakawara is a Panoan language spoken by about 550 of 860 ethnic tribal Chácobo people of the Beni Department of northwest of Magdalena, Bolivia, and (as of 2004) 17 of 50 Pakawara. Chácobo children are learning the language as a first language, but Pakawara is moribund.
Extinct Karipuna may have been a dialect; alternative names are Jaunavô (Jau-Navo) and Éloe. 
Several extinct and unattested languages were reported to have been related, perhaps dialects. These include Capuibo and Sinabo/Shinabo of the Mamoré River. However, nothing is actually known of these purported languages.

Carl Blair

Carl Blair (born November 28, 1932) is an artist and was for more than forty years a member of the art faculty at Bob Jones University.
Biography.
A native of Atchison, Kansas, Blair earned a B. A. in art at the University of Kansas and a M.F.A. from the Kansas City Art Institute. In addition to his teaching at BJU, he also served on the art faculty at KCAI summer programs and as a member of the cooperating faculty at the Greenville County Museum of Art. 
Blair exhibited his work in more than a hundred museums, art galleries and universities and won more than ninety national, state, and regional awards. His works have been purchased for more than 2500 private, corporate, and public collections. His exhibitions include the Art in Embassies Program; Ringling Museum of Art; Morris Museum, Augusta, Ga.; and the Hunter Museum, Chattanooga, Tenn. In 1995, the Greenville County Museum of Art in Greenville, S.C., hosted a major retrospective of his work. In 2000, a 40-year retrospective show was held at the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia. Blair refers to his style as “neither realistic nor abstract. I refer to my work as visual poetry.” Although best known for his oil, gouache, and acrylic paintings, late in his career, Blair began exhibiting sculpture, especially whimsical animals crafted of plywood or spruce pine boards. He recalled telling his BJU students to "never, never grow up and take yourself seriously."
Curiously, Blair did not discover that he was color-blind until he was an art student at the University of Kansas. Asked to do a self-portrait, he painted himself green. Although he once called his color-blindness an asset because he was “not hindered by color combinations,” in the 1990s, he began to wear a red contact lens in his left eye to help differentiate colors.
Blair was a member of the South Carolina Arts Commission for twelve years and also served as chairman of the commission for two years. In 1970, he and two other members of the Bob Jones University art faculty, Emery Bopp and Darell Koons, founded Hampton III Gallery, one of the first commercial galleries in Upstate South Carolina. In 2005 Blair was awarded the Verner Award for Lifetime Achievement, the highest award given by the state of South Carolina in the arts.

<doc id="9675717" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9675717" title="Ludwig Stössel">
Ludwig Stössel

Ludwig Stössel (February 12, 1883 – January 29, 1973) was an actor born in Lockenhaus, Austria. He was one of many Jewish actors and actresses who were forced to flee Europe when the Nazis came to power in 1933.
Stössel began performing on the stage in Austria and Germany when he was only 17. He soon became a successful character actor and played for the most important stages of Germany, among other at Max Reinhardt in Berlin, at the Barnowsky-Bühne and at the German Künstlertheater. Stössel became a movie actor at a later age. His first motion picture was a small role in the silent movie, "In der Heimat, da gibt's ein Wiedersehn!" in 1926 at the age of 43. He appeared in about a half dozen silent movies in Germany after this. Stössel received more roles with the arrival of sound.
Stössel's first sound movie was Georg Wilhelm Pabst's "Skandal um Eva" in 1930. The following year, he appeared in Max Neufeld's "Opernredoute" (Opera Ball). Later that year, he appeared as a hotel owner in the German comedy "Die Koffer des Herrn O.F." (The suitcases of Mr. O.F.) starring Peter Lorre and Hedy Lamarr. In 1932, he appeared as Riederer, The Amtshauptmann of the town of St. Vigil in "Der Rebell". Next he played Leon in "Hände aus dem Dunkel" (Hands from the Darkness). In 1933, Stössel received a small part in Fritz Lang's famous mystery thriller "Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse" ("The Testament of Dr. Mabuse"). This film was later banned by the Nazi government. Later, he played Pichler in the Carl Boese's comedy "Heimkehr ins Glück" (Lucky Homecoming). This would be his last movie in Germany.
When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Stössel was forced to leave Germany because of his Jewish background. He went back to Austria and appeared in a few movies, but his main activity was in the theater. In 1934, he appeared in the comedy, "Eine Nacht in Venedig" (A Night in Venice). His last movie in Austria was in 1937 with "Pfarrer von Kirchfeld" (The Pastor From Kirchfeld). After Hitler's forces took over Austria in the Anschluß of 1938, Stössel was imprisoned several times before he was able to escape Vienna and get to Paris. He, and his wife Lore Birn, eventually made it to London. He appeared in "Dead Man's Shoes" and another British film production before heading to Hollywood in 1939.
Stössel received his first role in an American movie in 1940. It was a good part as he played a pastor in Czechoslovakia during the Nazi take-over in the wartime drama "Four Sons" starring Don Ameche. His best scene is when he delivers the news to Frau Bern (Eugenie Leontovich) that her son has been killed in the war.
In 1942, he appeared with Ilka Grüning in "Underground". Stössel and Grünig appeared again in the Oscar-nominated "Kings Row" starring Ronald Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Claude Rains. Stössel and Grünig also appeared together in the Sonja Henie film "Iceland". Later that year, Stössel was cast to play Lou Gehrig's father in "Pride of the Yankees" starring Gary Cooper in the title role. German actress Elsa Janssen played Gehrig's mother.
A few months later, at the age of 59, he received the role of Mr. Leuchtag, who along with his wife are leaving Europe for America in "Casablanca". They have only one scene in the movie when they are having a drink in Rick's Cafe with their good friend Carl the waiter (S.Z. Sakall) and struggling a bit with their English. He asks his wife (Ilka Grünig) for the time, "Liebchen - sweetnessheart, what watch?" She answers, "Ten watch" and he replies "such much." Carl assures them they will get along beautifully in America The German translation for 10 o'clock is "zehn Uhr" however Uhr is also the German word for clock or in this case watch, thus ten watch.
Stössel appeared in supporting roles in over 40 movies after "Casablanca", most in the following ten years. The following year, he had a small role in another Humphrey Bogart movie, "Action in the North Atlantic".
He did a couple of anti-Nazi movies like "Hitler's Madman" in 1943. In this movie he portrays the mayor of a small town that is wiped out by a Nazi mass-execution in reprisal for the assassination of SS Commander Reinhard Heydrich. Later that year, he appeared in "The Strange Death of Adolph Hitler".
In 1944, he appeared in the Boris Karloff horror movie "The Climax". Later in 1944, Stössel teamed up with his movie wife from "Pride of the Yankees", Elsa Janssen, to play Mr. and Mrs. Steelman, a German couple loyal to America who drive their traitorous pro-Nazi son, played by George Sanders (who is actually working undercover for the U.S. government), out of their house in the spy drama "They Came to Blow Up America". In 1945, they teamed up again to play Mr. and Mrs. Otto in the "B" crime drama "Dillinger". Next, he was bitten in the throat by Count Dracula, played by John Carradine, in "House of Dracula". Later in 1945, Stössel played a teacher, who along with a llama, is in the opening scene of the Fred Astair musical "Yolanda and the Thief".
When the Second World War ended in 1945, Stössel decided not to return to Germany like many other German actors and actresses but remained in his adopted country making movies. In 1946, Grünig and Stössel got to play husband and wife again. Instead of being the Leuchtags, they were now the Muellers in "Temptation" starring Merle Oberon, George Brent and Paul Lukas.
In 1947, he had a small role portraying Albert Einstein in "The Beginning or the End". In 1948, he portrayed one of the lonely bachelor professors at a musical research institute in the Danny Kaye musical "A Song is Born". In 1949, Grünig and Stössel appeared in their last film together when they received roles in the drama "The Great Sinner" starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner. In 1953, Stössel played a Grand Duke in the musical "Call Me Madam" starring Ethel Merman and Donald O'Connor. His last film was in 1960, where he had a small role in the Elvis Presley movie, "G.I. Blues".
Stössel also did television. In 1955, he played Ludwig, a Carl the waiter clone, in the television version of Casablanca. He made two guest appearances on "Perry Mason" during the series' second season, including the role of Adolph Van Beers in "The Case of the Shattered Dream." From 1958 to 1960, Stössel played Charles Bronson's father in ABC's television series "Man with a Camera". From 1953 to 1963, Stössel appeared as a guest in a number of television shows including; "Cavalcade of America", "My Three Sons", "The Donna Reed Show", and "The New Phil Silvers Show" (where he parodied his Gallo wine television commercials). He guest starred in two Robert Young comedy series, "Father Knows Best" and "Window on Main Street".
Stössel became famous doing a long series of commercials for Italian Swiss Colony wine producers. Dressed in an Alpine hat and lederhosen, Stössel was their spokesman. His motto was, "That Little Old Winemaker, Me!" (they did not use his voice but had Jim Backus voice dub the line).
Stössel died on January 29, 1973 in Beverly Hills after a fall just 14 days short of his 90th birthday. He was cremated at Groman Mortuary in Hollywood Forever, and the ashes were sent to Vienna, Austria.

OMB Circular A-16

OMB Circular A-16, revised August 19, 2002, is a Government circular that was created by the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide guidance for federal agencies that create, maintain or use spatial data directly or indirectly through the establishment of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC).
The circular establishes guidelines for the management of digital spatial data and the use of those assets. It also appoints the FGDC to the interagency coordinating body for NSDI-related activities. The Secretary of the Interior is established as chair, with the Deputy Director for Management, OMB as Vice-Chair.
National Spatial Data Infrastructure.
The National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) ensures that spatial information is accurate and available to state, local, and tribal governments as well as to academia and the private sector. The NSDI obeys four primary values:
The NSDI supports the advancement for a Global Spatial Data Infrastructure that coincides with National Security interests. Any Federal system that develops international data in accordance with these systems must follow international voluntary standards as outlined by Circular A-119.
The NSDI has five parts:
Spatial Data.
Spatial Data is considered a national capital asset. The NSDI manages the distribution of these assets across all interconnected systems, federal and private sector, and analyzes it to determine the impact of the world economically, physically and socially upon the United States.
Part of NSDI's mission is to help avoid duplication or erroneous modification of this spatial data. Accurate and dependable spatial data allows NSDI to analyze current situational trends such as weather patterns, traffic congestions, and other various infrastructures to create a national snapshot in order to make predictions or projections based on these data.
Federal Geographic Data Committee.
The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) is an interagency committee delegated to manage OMB Circular A-16 related activities and implementation of NSDI policy and procedures in accordance with existing federal law and policy. The Department of the Interior provides administrative support to the FGDC when necessary in the event of enforcement of the structure and bylaws mentioned in this circular.
Circular policy.
Any agency that collects, produces, acquires, maintains, distributes, uses, or preserves any form of spatial data either directly or indirectly with any other agency or organization must follow the policies set forth by the circular.
The following exemplary list is representative of the kinds of systems to which the circular applies:
There are few exemptions to adherence to the policy described in the circular:
Agency responsibility.
Every agency that uses NSDI information must adhere to a set of responsibilities as outlined by the circular.

<doc id="9675788" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9675788" title="Peroxiredoxin">
Peroxiredoxin

Peroxiredoxins (Prxs, ) are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes that also control cytokine-induced peroxide levels and thereby mediate signal transduction in mammalian cells. The physiological importance of peroxiredoxins is illustrated by their relative abundance (one of the most abundant proteins in erythrocytes after hemoglobin is peroxiredoxin 2).
Classification.
Peroxiredoxins can be regulated by changes to phosphorylation, redox and possibly oligomerization states. They are divided into three classes:
These enzymes share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which a redox-active cysteine (the peroxidatic cysteine) in the active site is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. The recycling of the sulfenic acid back to a thiol is what distinguishes the three enzyme classes. 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are reduced by thiols such as glutathione, while the 1-Cys enzymes may be reduced by ascorbic acid or glutathione in the presence of GST-π. Using crystal structures, a detailed catalytic cycle has been derived for typical 2-Cys Prxs, including a model for the redox-regulated oligomeric state proposed to control enzyme activity. Inactivation of these enzymes by over-oxidation of the active thiol to sulfinic acid can be reversed by sulfiredoxin.
Peroxiredoxins are frequently referred to as alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) in bacteria. Other names include thiol specific antioxidant (TSA). This family contains AhpC and TSA, as well as related proteins.
Mammals express six peroxiredoxins:
Enzyme regulation.
This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.
Function.
Peroxiredoxin uses thioredoxin (Trx) to recharge after reducing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the following reactions:
The oxidized form of Prx is inactive, requiring the donation of electrons from reduced Trx to restore its catalytic activity.
The physiological importance of peroxiredoxins is illustrated by their relative abundance (one of the most abundant proteins in erythrocytes after hemoglobin is peroxiredoxin 2) as well as studies in knockout mice. Mice lacking peroxiredoxin 1 or 2 develop severe haemolytic anemia, and are predisposed to certain haematopoietic cancers. Peroxiredoxin 1 knockout mice have a 15% reduction in lifespan. Peroxiredoxin 6 knockout mice are viable and do not display obvious gross pathology, but are more sensitive to certain exogenous sources of oxidative stress, such as hyperoxia. Peroxiredoxin 3 (mitochondrial matrix peroxiredoxin) knockout mice are viable and do not display obvious gross pathology. Peroxiredoxins are proposed to play a role in cell signaling by regulating H2O2 levels.
Plant 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are post-translationally targeted to chloroplasts, where they protect the photosynthetic membrane against photooxidative damage. Nuclear gene expression depends on chloroplast-to-nucleus signalling and responds to photosynthetic signals, such as the acceptor availability at photosystem II and ABA.
Circadian clock.
Peroxiredoxins have been implicated in the 24-hour internal circadian clock of many organisms.

Makana

Makana is a mountain located on northern shore of the island of Kauai, where it rises above Limahuli Valley. 
"Makana" is a Hawaiian language term meaning gift or reward. It is often used as a person's name or as part of a name.
Limahuli Garden and Preserve preserves the valley below. It was featured in the 1958 film adaptation of the musical "South Pacific" as Bali Hai, a name that is still used to this day.
Makana Mountain is one of only two locations where the fire-throwing ceremony, ōahi, was performed in ancient Hawaiian times. The ōahi was a celebration of very special occasions such as the graduation of students from the hālau hula (hula school) at Kēē or the visit of an alii (high chief). On the day of the ceremony, skilled firethrowers climbed the steep cliffs to the very top of Makana Mountain laden with light, dry logs of pāpala ("Charpentiera" spp.) or hau ("Hibiscus tiliaceus"). When night fell, they set the logs afire and hurled them out over the ocean. Ridge lifts created by trade winds hitting the sheer cliff of Makana kept the firebrands aloft, soaring as far as out to sea. The result was a night sky filled with sparks and fiery torches tracing long arcs of light.
It is sometimes called "Fireworks Cliff".
People in canoes would crowd the ocean below Makana, trying to catch the firebrands. It was considered heroic to catch the flaming embers, and those who succeeded would often mark themselves with the fire in honor of the occasion. Couples who caught the firebrands would both mark themselves in the same way, as a sign of love and commitment.
The practice ended in the 19th century, with the last ceremony having been in honor of Queen Emma.

The Complete Stories of Franz Kafka

The Complete Stories of Franz Kafka is a compilation of all Kafka's short stories. With the exception of Kafka's three novels ("The Trial", "The Castle" and "Amerika"), this collection includes all of Kafka's narrative work. The book was originally edited by Nahum N. Glatzer and published by Schocken Books in 1971. It was reprinted in 1995 with an introduction by John Updike.
The collection includes all the works published during Kafka's lifetime, with the exception of "The Stoker" which is usually incorporated as the first chapter of his unfinished novel "Amerika". Some of the stories included in the book are fragmented or in various states of incompletion. Most of the stories are translated by Willa and Edwin Muir, with occasional translations by Tania and James Stern. 
Several fables, parables and philosophical pieces are not included in this collection, as they were never meant to be independent stories or never intended for publication. These can be found in Kafka's diaries, notebooks and letters.

Grayrigg derailment

The Grayrigg derailment was a fatal railway accident that occurred at approximately 20:15 GMT on 23 February 2007, just to the south of Grayrigg, Cumbria, in the North West England region of the United Kingdom. The initial conclusion of the accident investigation is that the derailment was caused by a faulty set of points (number 2B) on the Down Main running line, controlled from Lambrigg ground frame. The scheduled inspection on 18 February 2007 had not taken place and the faults had gone undetected. The points which caused the derailment, and points 2A on the opposite line, were removed from the track following the derailment and the line is now welded continuously for including the line over the Docker viaduct.
The derailment also brought down the overhead line equipment which had to be replaced. Modern double-line catenary from a single stand was used for this, which reduces the risk of carriages bending if a derailment occurs, for example becoming wedged between the overhead line stanchions as seen in the Southall crash. Although the accident killed far fewer people than some other accidents on the West Coast Main Line, it had a serious financial impact on Network Rail.

Train 1S83, the 17:15 Virgin West Coast "Pendolino" West Coast Main Line InterCity service from London Euston to Glasgow Central, was derailed at 20:15 by a faulty set of points almost immediately after crossing the Docker Viaduct (the rear half of the train would still have been crossing the bridge whilst the front derailed at the points). The train was reported to have been travelling at , when it was derailed. The train, consisting of unit 390 033 "City of Glasgow", which was constructed at Washwood Heath, Birmingham, in 2002, had nine carriages and carried 105 passengers and four staff members.
Passengers said that the carriages of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment, with the first carriages jack-knifing and most of the train coming to rest in a field. The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment to make sure there was no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields. Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.
The train's derailment caused severe damage to the Overhead Line Equipment and tripped the entire circuit between Brock (near Preston) and Tebay resulting in a number of other electric-powered services coming to a halt and all signaling equipment immediately turning to danger (red) in accordance with the system's fail safe design.
Live BBC television coverage at 08:15 the following morning showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five carriages, were the worst affected, and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition. The leading carriage, a driving motor coach, had headed down the embankment, and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side at the foot of the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment. All the carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the carriages. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver, who had stayed at the controls (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.
Survivors were initially received at Grayrigg Primary School, which had been opened as a Survivor Reception Centre. Hospitals in the area, including some over the Scottish border in Dumfries and Galloway, were put on standby, but not all received patients. According to BBC News, five passengers were admitted to Royal Preston Hospital in a critical condition. Police later released a statement revealing that one passenger, 84-year-old Margaret Masson from Glasgow, had died in hospital. Her funeral took place on 31 March 2007 at Craigton crematorium in Glasgow.
The location of the accident
Aftermath.
A family liaison centre was set up in Glasgow Central Station for worried relatives.
Within three hours of the derailment the site of the accident had been sealed off with a five-mile cordon. The line was expected to be closed for two weeks, with Virgin Trains saying that the line would not reopen to passenger services until 12 March 2007. The recovery operation was slowed by problems in getting heavy lifting gear to the site which required temporary roads to be constructed.
Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Group chairman, visited the site of the derailment at 11:00 the following morning to comment on the incident. During his news conference at the site he said that he regarded the driver, named as Iain Black from Dumbarton, as a hero, as he had attempted to stop the train and remained in his seat to ensure the safety of passengers. Mr Black left hospital in late March and stated that "I've got to be in the cab to help the train and it never crossed my mind to leave."
Branson also later thanked local residents for their help at the accident site, describing how he "was very impressed to hear how those kind people rallied round, opening their hearts and opening their doors to strangers in distress". Local farmers assisted the emergency services by transporting equipment using quad bikes and four-wheel drive vehicles. Sergeant Jo Fawcett of the Cumbria Constabulary also offered thanks, saying that "There are so many people who have given up their own time to contribute in some way to dealing with the aftermath of the derailment that it would be unfair to name them for fear of missing someone out."
Branson also paid tribute to the Pendolino train, comparing it to a "tank". He also added "If the train had been old stock then the number of injuries and the mortalities would have been horrendous". Several sources also gave their praise due to the fact that the carriages generally stayed intact during the accident.
As a result of the suspicion that faulty points were the cause of the Grayrigg Derailment, Network Rail checked over 700 sets of similar points across the country as a "precautionary measure" saying later that "nothing of concern" had been found.
The operation to remove the train from the site began on the evening of 1 March 2007 with the first carriages moved from the embankment. This allowed passengers' property to be retrieved and gave investigators access to the train interior, which previously had not been possible because it would have been unsafe. The last of the carriages were removed on 4 March 2007 and the A685 road was reopened.
In 2013 the British Transport Police (BTP) posthumously awarded a Chief Constables Commendation to a member of its staff, Jon Ratcliffe, who was at the time of the disaster Media and Marketing Manager for BTP's North Western Area. He received the commendation for his good handling of media enquires in the aftermath of the crash. Jon Ratcliffe passed away in 2008 following a sudden illness.
Cause.
Lambrigg ground frame, south-west of the accident site, controls two crossovers, each one comprising two sets of points allowing trains to cross from one running line to the other in emergencies or during track maintenance work. These points are used only occasionally, operated locally after a release is obtained from Carlisle power signal box. They are normally locked in the main line "running" position. Early statements by Chief Superintendent Martyn Ripley of British Transport Police suggested that investigations would focus on these points.
Investigations were launched by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch and Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate. RMT rail union leader Bob Crow said on BBC News that a points failure was responsible for the incident. Experts compared the cause to that of the Potters Bar rail crash in 2002.
On 26 February, an interim report published by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was the condition of the stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train.
Following the RAIB report, Network Rail released a statement in which its Chief Executive, John Armitt, described how the organisation was "devastated to conclude that the condition of the set of points at Grayrigg caused this terrible accident". He apologised "to all the people affected by the failure of the infrastructure".
The RAIB report noted that the Network Rail New Measurement Train ran over the site on 21 February. This train uses lasers and other instruments to make measurements of the track geometry and other features such as overhead line height and stagger, and the track gauge, twist and cant. It is not used to inspect points, but it does make a video record of the track which can be reviewed later. Commenting on the possibility that the train's video might have been used to detect the points damage and thereby prevent the accident, a Network Rail spokesman said:
The train runs at speeds of up to 125 mph, or 95 mph on this stretch. There would be no point somebody watching it at that speed as they wouldn't be able to pick up any faults. It has to be run in super-slow motion to spot faults. The train runs for up to 18 hours a day, seven days a week. It would probably take someone most of the month to watch one day's worth of data. It's not what it's there for. It's a backwards reference tool.
Network Rail admitted it failed to carry out a scheduled visual track inspection in the area on the Sunday before the derailment.
Bob Crow of the RMT union said:
This is shutting the stable door after the horse has well and truly bolted. We argued this train should not replace visual inspections. Inspectors who walk the track are the eyes and ears of the railway. They don't just check the safety of the track, they look at the area surrounding it, check for signs of potential trouble such as gaps in the fence where vandals could get in.
Labour Party Member of Parliament John McDonnell added: "The fact that Network Rail apparently had footage of a missing stretcher bar days before the fatal crash is very worrying."
As part of the investigation by the British Transport Police, three Network Rail employees were arrested and bailed, one in July 2007 and two in November 2007 All three were due to answer bail in March 2008 but this was extended until the end of June pending further inquiries. On 9 February 2009, the British Transport Police confirmed that none of the three Network Rail employees arrested in connection with the derailment will be charged following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service.
Subsequent service disruption.
Immediately after the accident, all services were suspended and the First ScotRail Sleeper train, the Caledonian Sleeper, was curtailed and passengers transferred to overnight coaches.
The line closure that followed the initial service suspension saw most Virgin services terminate at Preston or Lancaster from the south, with buses to Carlisle and all stations along the route. The only exception was an early-morning and late-evening through service from Carlisle to London and return. This was diesel-hauled via Blackburn and Settle. There were also several non-stop trains from Preston to London Euston. Local services all terminated short but many were able to make their journeys as their destinations were off branches. The Caledonian Sleeper was diverted via the East Coast Main Line, along with freight services, although some were diesel-hauled via Blackburn and Settle.
Trains began running on the line again on 12 March subject to a speed restriction of at the crash site. The first train was the 05:10 Manchester to Glasgow.
Prior incidents.
The Grayrigg derailment was not the first British railway accident to feature a train or locomotive named "City of Glasgow" on the West Coast Mainline. In the Harrow and Wealdstone railway accident on 8 October 1952, the locomotive of the sleeper train from Perth to London Euston, whose crew was responsible for the incident, was Class 8P No. 46242 "City of Glasgow".
In the area near the accident, south of Tebay in Cumbria, on 15 February 2004 another fatal incident had occurred, the Tebay rail accident, when four rail workers were killed by a runaway track maintenance trailer. Also close by was a collision on the Lambrigg Crossing on 18 May 1947.
Prosecution.
On 13 January 2012, the Office of Rail Regulation announced that Network Rail were to be prosecuted under Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 for "the company's failure to provide and implement suitable and sufficient standards, procedures, guidance, training, tools and resources for the inspection and maintenance of fixed stretcher bar points". At the first hearing at Lancaster Magistrates' Court on 28 February 2012, Network Rail indicated an intention to plead Guilty to the charges. On 4 April 2012, Network Rail were fined a total of £4,118,037 including costs following the court case.
Critical commentary appeared in the media concerning the knighthood awarded to John Armitt in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to engineering and construction. Armitt had been Chief Executive of Network Rail at the time of the Grayrigg derailment, and the family of a victim of the accident criticised the award, which coincidentally was conferred on the same day that Network Rail were prosecuted for the accident.
After a two week hearing one of the issues Coroner Ian Smith announced that he would be issuing a rule 43 report. The intention of the report is to raise concerns with authorities in order to prevent similar incidents occurring again.

Gurmeet Singh Dhinsa

Gurmeet Singh Dhinsa (born c. 1962) is an American former gas station magnate, who was convicted of racketeering and multiple murders. In an attempt to corner the local market on gas stations, Dhinsa defrauded customers, evaded taxes, committed at least two murders, and is believed to have ordered eight others. He is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release in a federal prison.
Early life.
Dhinsa was born a Sikh in Punjab and emigrated to the Bronx in 1982. He worked as a gas station attendant until he was able to save enough money to lease the station himself. As business improved, Dhinsa's company, Citygas Gasoline Corp "City Gas" opened more stations in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. At its height, City Gas had 51 locations and 300 employees, with annual revenues of $60 million.
Criminal activities.
When Dhinsa leased his first gas station in 1984, neighborhood residents were using the lot to park their cars. According to a witness, Dhinsa smashed every windshield with a baseball bat. The cars were moved, and the gas station became profitable.
As he expanded his business, Dhinsa modified gas pumps, evaded taxes on gasoline bought in bulk, and kept his employees silent with death threats. He was arrested in 1990 on suspicion of kidnapping, robbery, and assault, but served only 90 days by pleading guilty to a weapons charge. In 1993, he was convicted of weapons charges again and served a year in prison.
In July 1995, Dhinsa ordered associates to kidnap an employee he suspected of stealing. When the victim's brother came looking for him in early 1997, Dhinsa ordered his murder. This killing was reported to police by several residents of the neighborhood. Police discovered that Dhinsa's brother Gurdip, who had fled to India to avoid prosecution for a 1991 murder, was back in the U.S. and was working at City Gas. On May 16, 1997, police surrounded the City Gas headquarters and arrested three employees, including Gurdip. When Gurmeet Dhinsa arrived at the scene, he was held for questioning and released. Although Dhinsa was released, a task force was formed to look into his operation, including the investigation of several disappearances and unsolved homicides. The kidnapped employee was never found. 
On July 1, 1997, police were called by a man who claimed Dhinsa had threatened him and his family. Later that day, investigators stopped Dhinsa and searched the car he was driving. When Dhinsa opened the trunk, the police discovered circuit boards for gas pumps.
Arrest and trial.
Police arrested Dhinsa on July 7. At the same time, Dhinsa's car was seized and inventoried. Evidence of gas pump tampering, including Department of Consumer Affairs metal seals and inspection stickers, was found during the search.
On August 22, 1997, Dhinsa was indicted by a grand jury on 29 counts including racketeering, murder, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, and witness intimidation. 
Dhinsa was represented by high-profile defense attorney Gerald Shargel, but was found guilty of murder and racketeering after an eight-week trial. Although the prosecution sought the death penalty, the jury turned down the request and Dhinsa was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In addition, Dhinsa was forced to pay $1.75 million in restitution and fines—$625,000 to the family of each victim as well as a separate $500,000 fine to the city—and his businesses were auctioned by the government to cover civil fines.

Starry Nights

Starry Nights was Shobha De's second novel. It is said that the novels' characters, Aasha Rani and her lover Akshay, were based on the real life love-affairs of Amitabh Bachchan with Rekha Ganesan and Dharmendra Singh Deol with Hema Malini. It was a best seller in India and cemented its authors reputation as being a provocative and daring author.
Plot summary.
The protagonist of the book is Aasha Rani, a dark, chubby girl from Madras who has striven for seven years to become a famous Bollywood starlet. Her mother, Amma, has pushed her to attain this status by selling herself into the world of blue films before she was twelve years old, and when she was fifteen to Kishenbhai, a once-famous producer who was encouraged by Amma to take her as a lover in exchange for a film role. Kishenbhai, unable to secure a role for her any other way, finances a film with his own money after promoting her as the newest Bollywood starlet and having her sleep with the appropriate people to secure her attention and renaming her from Viji to Aasha Rani. He then proceeds to fall madly in love with her, who abandons him as she strives to get ahead in the filmi world, fully aware that she was just being used by him at first and is thus unable to return the affection of the older man. 
She falls in love with Akshay Arora, a famous Bollywood sex symbol who stars in a string of hits with her. Amma, who had been living with her in Mumbai, was sent away to Madras by Aasha for objecting to Akshay beating her one day. Eventually Akshay gets bored with her and after his wife confronts her unsuccessfully about her affair with her husband, he reveals to "Showbiz" magazine that she was a former pornographic actress, and effectively has her blackballed from making further films. When she accosts him at a society party about this, he beats her. Sheth Amirchand, a Member of Parliament and the gangster that controls most of the Mumbai underworld, then takes an interest in Aasha Rani and she becomes his lover and restarts her career under his protection. She then has an affair with Linda, a gossip columnist for "Showbiz" magazine and Abhijit Mehra, the son of an industrialist, who is about to be married. Linda advises her to go to the south and do an art film, which she does, where she tries to seduce the director only to find that he is impotent. Her interest in her work declines as she continue to obsess over Akshay Arora. She confronts him at a traffic light as their cars are next to each other and their affair is rekindled for a short time. She attempts to get Akshay to marry her, but when it becomes apparent that his interest in her is only due to his flagging stardom and not out of affection for her, she attempts suicide. 
Her lesbian lover Linda, meanwhile, writes a juicy scoop on her suicide attempt. After she recovers she rekindles her affair with Abhijit Mehra, but Malini, Akshay's wife, reports this to his father and he has his weak-willed son Abhijit cut the affair off and sends Aasha to New Zealand with instructions to keep out of Abhijit's life. Aasha then retires to New Zealand and decided to leave the film business. She marries a New Zealander named Jamie Phillips (Jay) and has a child with him. Since Jay is not Indian and not in the film business, it occurs to her that she does not have to retire once she is married as is the custom in India. It is then revealed that Akshay has succumbed to AIDS as a result of his promiscuous lifestyle. Sudha Rani claims that Jay tried to seduce her and in revenge, Aasha Rani initiates an affair with Jojo, the producer of her next film. 
Aasha Rani is forced out of the film industry by Jojo's wife, who sends "goondahs" to threaten her. She flies back to New Zealand and meets a man called Gopalakrishnan who she has sex with in the bathroom of the plane. She discovers that her husband is having an affair with her babysitter and they decide that their marriage is over. Her daughter, Sasha rejects her and begins to have her own identity crisis as a multiracial child. Aasha then meets a young lady named Shonali who she begins to spend a lot of time with. She is a London socialite and call girl and introduces Aasha to London High Society. At a party, Aasha notices Gopalakrishnan, the man she had sex with on the flight to London. He turns out to be an arms dealer. She accosts him and later he has an assassin quartered at her house and threatens to have her daughter murdered if she tells. Shonali murders the assassin and ushers Aasha Rani out of the country. 
Sudha Rani has meanwhile had a film financed by the mob and she begins to doctor the books instead of repaying her debts. The gangsters have her assaulted by some thugs and they set her on fire. Sudha Rani is badly burned and is forced out of the film industry, and Aasha reconciles with her. As Appa weakens, he reveals that he has kept position of a studio that Aasha can use to support herself by preparing her daughter, Sasha, to take her place as Bollywood's next starlet.

Battle Angel (OVA)

Battle Angel, known in Japan as , is an original video animation based on the "Battle Angel Alita" manga by Yukito Kishiro. The OVA comprises two episodes, "Rusty Angel" and "Tears Sign", that serve as a compressed preview for the manga. They correspond respectively to volumes 1 and 2 of the manga, with some differences. According to Kishiro, only two episodes were originally planned. At the time, he was too busy with the manga "to review the plan ", nor was he serious about an anime adaptation. There are no plans to revive the anime.
The OVA spawned a memorable soundtrack including the theme song and "Cyborg Mermaid". Although it received a lukewarm reception in Japan, U.S. critics held it to be one of the best anime to be translated and brought to America in the 1990s. Manga Entertainment's UK and Australian version is just a single movie.
Plot.
Rusty Angel.
As he scavenges the Zalem dump heap for useful parts, cyberphysician Daisuke Ido comes across the remains of a female cyborg, who is still alive. Ido takes her home and decides to restore her, transferring her into a new cyborg body.
Shortly after, Gally becomes interested in Yugo, a local boy who is performing maintenance work for Ido. After Ido returns home late that night, the following day Gally notices his injured arm, which he explains away as the result of a fall. After introducing herself to Yugo, he convinces her to go with him and the two leave just as Chiren arrives.
Yugo and Gally try to climb onto the roof of an abandoned factory, but they both fall. Instinctively, Gally manages to catch Yugo and land safely. On the roof, they contemplate Zalem as Yugo discusses his interest in the floating city. Gally makes her interest in him known, but Yugo's obsession with Zalem blinds him to this.
Ido and Chiren go out for a drink. Chiren is obsessed with returning to Zalem, and views being in Scrap Iron City and Ido's acceptance of his lot in life as a waste. He warns her not to get involved with The Factory, and says he has no regrets about what happened in Zalem.
That night, Gally is awakened by Ido going out. Curious, she decides to follow. Elsewhere in Scrap Iron City, a lone woman on her way home runs into the criminals Rasha and Grewcica. Before they can do anything to her, Ido appears and attacks Rasha with his rocket hammer, slicing off his left arm, but getting stabbed in the shoulder. Gally then arrives, killing Rasha by punching his head off. Grewcica, enraged at Rasha's death, manages to deflect one of Ido's attacks. He then fights Gally, who slices off his right arm with a kick before knocking him into the sewers. Surprised at Gally's abilities, Ido also notices her bloodlust and regret at not being able to finish Grewcica off.
Ido takes Rasha's head to The Factory to collect the bounty, explaining the nature of his work as a hunter-warrior. Gally, realizing that something has awakened within her, decides to become one as well, but Ido will have none of it, so she runs off.
After sealing their deal with sex, Vector tells Chiren that her part of the bargain involves upgrading the coliseum gladiators. Soon after, a damaged Grewcica arrives at Chiren's apartment, begging for help. His mention of Ido and Gally catches Chiren's attention.
The next day, Ido realizes that Gally's life is hers to lead, but wonder if her desire to follow him as a hunter/warrior is a result of some residual memory. Gally returns to The Factory and registers herself as a hunter-warrior, but when she asks about Zalem, the only answer she gets is "no comment". In the meantime, Chiren starts to rebuild and upgrade Grewcica to defeat Gally. Gally returns to Ido's, where he accepts her decision to become a hunter-warrior. That night, they head out to Bar Kansas, while elsewhere in Scrap Iron City, Yugo robs a cyborg of his spinal column.
Just as they arrive at Bar Kansas, Gally and Ido are confronted by a newly-rebuilt and upgraded Grewcica, who uses a cutter installed in one of his fingertips to shred a stray dog that Gally picked-up to pieces. Without help from the other hunter-warriors, Gally accepts Grewcica's challenge. Chiren then appears, wondering which of the two cyborgs will prevail.
The scene shifts to the Zalem dump heap, where Gally and Grewcica's fight is watched by Ido, Chiren, and an unnamed hunter-warrior (Gime). Grewcica has an initial advantage, but Gally is able to dodge his subsequent attacks. Using her superior speed and ability to generate plasma, she first disables one, then both of Grewcica's arms before slicing him in two, killing him. Chiren hysterically acknowledges her loss, but vows vengeance. As they leave the dump heap, Gally assures Ido that she will still remain Gally no matter how much she changes.
Tears Sign.
As Yugo and Tanji prepare to leave an alley with their cyborg victim's spinal column, Vector appears and kills the cyborg to eliminate him as a witness, then admonishes Yugo for his carelessness.
At Yugo's place, Gally waits for Yugo with his neighbors, who are skeptical of his plan to get to Zalem. After turning down Vector's offer of a role in his business operations, which include control of the resources sent to Zalem via The Factory tubes, Yugo - intoxicated - is dropped off by Vector, who notices Gally. In his apartment, Yugo discusses his dream of Zalem with Gally. To help him out, she embarks on a bounty spree, earning bags of credit chips.
Later, a customer who has taken up Yugo up on his offer for a lube job reveals himself as a hunter-warrior in disguise (Zapan) who realizes that Yugo is about to paralyze him from behind. Tanji attacks Zapan, who deflects his attack and kills him. Yugo throws a fire bottle on Zapan, engulfing him in flames and enabling him to flee, but Zapan knows that there will soon be a bounty on him.
Vector, who is with Chiren at his office, gets a call from Yugo apprising him of the situation and tells Yugo to bring his chips to his office. After the call, a news broadcast reveals that Zahriki, the reigning coliseum champion after Grewcica's disappearance, has lost again. Vector tells Chiren that it will be time to rebuild Zahriki, but Chiren complains that this is moot as all her efforts seem to be fruitless. Vector then notices a newspaper piece on Gally, recognizing her. Chiren also recognizes her, and is surprised at Vector's scheme to have Gally fight in the coliseum for him by using Yugo as leverage. He gives Chiren the task of tracking Gally down with the promise of sending her to Zalem if she succeeds.
Outside The Factory, Ido is surprised at Gally having collected fourteen bounties in seven days, as she did not become a hunter-warrior for the money. As they discuss how Yugo and Gally feel about each other on the way home, they discover from a bounty update broadcast that Yugo is now a bounty. Gime is shown receiving the news as well. Gally sets off to look for Yugo, not finding him at his place. Chiren, who has been on stakeout, follows her.
At the same abandoned factory he visited with Gally in "Rusty Angel", Yugo finds that he is 500,000 short of the 10 million chips he needs to buy passage to Zalem from Vector. Gally finds him here, after which they discuss what Yugo will do next. He refuses to relinquish his dream of reaching Zalem. Gally confesses her love for him, but Yugo brushes it off. Desperate to know how he feels about her, Gally confronts him. Yugo admits that they are now partners in crime, and Gally kisses him.
Afterwards, Gally asks Yugo about the scar on his right wrist. As Chiren eavesdrops on their conversation, Yugo reveals his personal history about how the hand is a keepsake of his older brother, an engineer of The Factory who planned to fly to Zalem by constructing an airship. His wife however, betrayed him to The Factory and he was killed by a hunter-warrior (Gime) on the night the airship was finished. Gally reveals that she empathizes with Yugo's sister in-law, and offers to help Yugo get to Zalem. The discussion changes something within Chiren.
After the storm abates, Yugo heads outside. Hearing him suddenly scream, Gally rushes out to find Gime standing over Yugo, whose right arm has been cut off. She attacks Gime, who blocks her attack and claims his right to the bounty on Yugo. He also reveals his jealousy at Gally's having beaten him to all the bounties since Grewcica. Realizing that the relationship between her and Yugo has more meaning, Gime fights her with a double-edged sword. He gets Gally in position to deliver a killing blow, but she blocks his blade with her hands while charging it with electricity. A bolt of lightning that is attracted to the electric charge hits Gime, incinerating him. As Gally holds a dying Yugo and wonders how she can save him, Chiren appears.
Gally then goes to Ido's with Yugo's body and head and begs him to save Yugo. After successfully transplanting Yugo's head onto a cyborg body, Ido reveals that bypassing her life support system and connecting it to Yugo's head kept his brain alive. Gally reveals that Chiren did this, which surprises Ido.
Back at Vector's, Chiren tells him Yugo was killed by a hunter-warrior and that she cannot find Gally. As she is about to leave, Vector tells her that he will now send her to Zalem.
As Yugo lies on the operating table, he overhears Ido tell Gally that the idea of buying passage to Zalem is a lie because no one knows this better than he does, a former citizen of Zalem. He wakes up screaming in denial, and escapes from the clinic. Gally races off in pursuit, while Ido sees the bag of Yugo's chips and becomes enraged.
Going to Vector's office, Ido confronts Vector about lying to Yugo. He also discovers what is left of Chiren: organs and body parts in preservation tubes. Vector reveals that this is to fulfill a monthly quota that comes down from Zalem, and presses a button that reveals Zahriki from behind a screen. Zahriki attacks Ido, who dodges the attack and slices Zahriki in half with his rocket hammer, which flies into and kills Vector.
High above the city, Yugo has started to walk on a Factory tube towards Zalem. Soon, a massive spiked ring comes hurtling down the tube, forcing him to jump to avoid it, but his feet are destroyed in the process. Gally reaches the base of the tube and prepares to follow Yugo, who has survived the first ring to come down, but has lost his feet.
After emerging past the clouds, Yugo can clearly see Zalem. Gally, who has caught up with him, pleads with him to return. Yugo is still adamant about reaching Zalem, but Gally convinces him that they can find a way to live in Scrap Iron City together. Another ring comes hurtling down the tube and Gally's warning comes too late as Yugo is shredded by the ring and thrown into the air. Leaping after him, Gally manages to grab his remaining arm and use her knife to secure herself to the tube. His elbow joints cannot hold however and break loose, but not before Yugo is able to say goodbye, leaving Gally on the tube clutching his forearm.
At sunset, Ido and Gally are in the Zalem dump heap. They place Yugo's forearm and Chiren's earring into a basket attached to a balloon, and release it in the direction of Zalem.
Differences between the OVA and manga.
Names used.
In its translation, ADV Films used the Japanese names for Tiphares and the Scrapyard as well as several characters. These names differ from the names used by Viz Media in its translation of the manga. There are also slight differences in other character names used. The equivalent anime and manga names are outlined below. Discussion of the anime characters will utilize the names used by ADV, while discussion of the manga equivalents will utilize the names used by Viz.
The Manga Entertainment translation, released only in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia on VHS, used some of the names from the Viz translation and went by the title of "Battle Angel Alita". There is no news of a Region 2 "Battle Angel Alita" DVD.
Soundtracks.
Gunnm: Image Album.
Gunnm: Image Album is primarily an image album with songs inspired by the OVA. The exceptions are "Cyborg Mermaid", the ending theme song, and two instrumentals. The album included a sticker and short filmstrip from the OVA.
Gunnm: Another Story.
Gunnm: Another Story is primarily a soundtrack with the exception of "Cyborg Mermaid", the ending theme song, an image track, and two drama tracks.

George Chetwynd

Sir George Roland Chetwynd, CBE (14 May 1916 – 2 September 1982) was a British lecturer, politician and public servant. He defeated Harold Macmillan in order to get elected as a Member of Parliament, but later left Parliament to become Director of the North East Development Council for five years in the 1960s.
Education.
Chetwynd was the son of a miner, and was brought up in north Warwickshire. An academically gifted child, he passed the Eleven plus and attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Atherstone; he then won a place at King's College London where he obtained a BA (Hons.) in History and a postgraduate scholarship in the same subject. He joined the Labour Party in 1936 and earned a living by being a lecturer for the Workers Educational Association.
Wartime service.
In 1940, during World War II, Chetwynd enlisted in the Royal Artillery. Two years later he was commissioned into the Royal Army Educational Corps where he trained troops; by the end of the war he held the rank of Captain. At the 1945 general election, Chetwynd fought Stockton-on-Tees as the Labour Party candidate against the rising Conservative minister Harold Macmillan; in one of the first results to be declared, he won with a majority of 8,664.
Parliament.
He made his mark in Parliament as a generally loyal supporter of the government, which was put under pressure from the left. He saw nothing inconsistent in membership of the United Nations while retaining strong armed forces for the United Kingdom. Although initially opposed to the continuation of national service in peacetime, he later came round to support it. He also spoke in favour of the Town and Country Planning Bill in 1947. In March of that year he appealed for greater efforts to build new factories on Tees-side. In March 1948 he signed an all party motion calling for a 'Council of Western Europe' to prepare the way for an organic federation of European states. Chetwynd was approached to sign a telegram to Pietro Nenni, a Communist-allied Italian socialist, but refused to have anything to do with it.
Alliance with Hugh Dalton.
With Chetwynd being particularly close to Hugh Dalton, when Dalton returned to government in May 1948 he chose Chetwynd as his Parliamentary Private Secretary. He was a strong supporter of nationalisation of the steel industry, which was a major employer in his constituency. He retained his seat through the 1950 and 1951 general elections, and made an easy transition into opposition after 1951.
Opposition politics.
His interest in European cooperation was marked by appointment as a delegate to the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe from 1952 to 1954. He was also a Governor of Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton and was Chair of the Governors in 1952. He was also a supporter of walking in the countryside (and went rambling with Hugh Dalton); he was a member of Nature Conservancy. In 1953, Chetwynd seconded a Private member's bill brought in by Samuel Viant which banned the sale of toy weapons; he argued that possession of these weapons "was a real incentive to development of the gangster mentality".
In the late 1950s Chetwynd became more concerned with economic development in his constituency. He sponsored a private member's bill in 1957 to make Stockton-on-Tees into a County borough, but was defeated by 201 to 95. He was also concerned over problems with nuclear power stations, although supportive of nuclear power and nuclear weapons generally. He opposed government spending on space research, regarding it as "an attempt to keep up with the Joneses".
North East development.
After the 1959 general election, Chetwynd was made an opposition spokesman on Aviation. He pressed for investment in the aviation industry, including the construction of a supersonic airliner. However, in late 1961 he was applied for and was offered the job of Director of the North East Development Council, giving him responsibility for selling the region to overseas investors. Chetwynd resigned his seat and took up the appointment in January 1962.
Shortly after his appointment Chetwynd began to 'sell' the North East region by giving a press conference for American firms where he argued that France was too politically unstable and West Germany had a labour shortage. Later that year, his annual report complained that the north east had received fewer government grants for industrial development than other regions. He objected to the London-centric economy of the United Kingdom and called for better transport infrastructure to redress it. The North East Development Council made several attempts to get a personal meeting with Harold Macmillan, then Prime Minister, in 1963. He often complained about the poor public image of the north-east.
Other public roles.
From 1964, Chetwynd began to receive other public appointments, first as a member of the General Advisory Council of the Independent Television Authority and of the North-East Advisory Committee for Civil Aviation. He was put on the Northern Economic Planning Council in the same year. Chetwynd's interest in aviation was also used on the board of the British Overseas Airways Corporation from 1966 to 1974. In 1968 he was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees.
Business appointments.
Chetwynd left the North East Development Council in February 1967 to become Deputy Chairman of the Land Commission. This appointment was part-time and allowed him to increase his business involvement: he was a Director of the Northern and Tubes Group of British Steel Corporation from 1968 and a board member of the whole British Steel Corporation group from 1970. He was Chairman of the Land Commission from 1970, an appointment intended to be for three years but actually lasted only one.
A Director of the Northern Industrial Development Board from 1972, Chetwynd decreased his involvement as the 1970s went on. He moved onto the Northern Regional Health Authority as Vice-Chairman from 1973 to 1976, and as Chairman from 1978. He was also Chairman of the Council of BBC Radio Cleveland from 1976 to 1978. He was given a Knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours list. He was replaced as Chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority in June 1982 by Norman Fowler shortly after criticising the Conservative government's conduct of a pay dispute, although this was said to have been a coincidence.

Jack Mytton Way

The Jack Mytton Way is a long distance footpath and bridleway for horseriders, hillwalkers and mountain bikers in mid and south Shropshire, England. It typically takes a week to ride on horseback. 
For much of its length it passes through the Shropshire Hills AONB and includes parts of Wenlock Edge. It passes over the Clee Hills, and through the towns of Cleobury Mortimer, Church Stretton, Clun and Much Wenlock, passing close to Bridgnorth, Broseley and Highley. The south-west end is at Llanfair Waterdine. East of Roman Bank, it forms a loop.
It is named after Jack Mytton (1796–1834) a Shropshire landowner, MP, horseman, foxhunter, gambler and Regency rake. He was also known as Mad Jack.

<doc id="9676138" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9676138" title="Fast neutron therapy">
Fast neutron therapy

Fast neutron therapy utilizes high energy neutrons typically greater than 20 MeV to treat cancer. Most fast neutron therapy beams are produced from proton beams impinging upon beryllium targets.
Advantages.
Radiation therapy of cancers is based upon the biological response of cells to ionizing radiation. Tumor cells typically lack effective repair mechanisms, so if radiation is delivered in small sessions, a process known as fractionation, normal tissue will have time to repair itself. This repair of normal tissue means that there is a therapeutic ratio between cancer cells and normal cells.
In addition, different types of ionizing radiation will produce different effects upon cells. A comparison of neutrons with gamma radiation illustrates the differences. Both neutrons and gamma-rays are uncharged; for this reason they are referred to as indirectly ionizing radiation. The biological effect of neutrons or gamma-rays is due almost completely to the secondary electrons that they produce when they interact with a patient's tissue.
LET.
When therapeutic energy X-rays (1 to 25 MeV) interact with cells in human tissue, they do so mainly by Compton interactions, and produce relatively high energy secondary electrons. These high energy electrons deposit their energy at about 1 keV/µm. By comparison, the charged particles produced at a site of a neutron interaction may deliver their energy at a rate of 30-80 keV/µm. The amount of energy deposited as the particles traverse a section of tissue is referred to as the Linear Energy Transfer (LET). X-rays produce low LET radiation, and neutrons produce high LET radiation.
Because the electrons produced from X-rays have high energy and low LET, when they interact with a cell typically only a few ionizations will occur. It is likely then that the low LET radiation will cause only single strand breaks of the DNA helix. Single strand breaks of DNA molecules can be readily repaired, and so the effect on the target cell is not necessarily lethal. By contrast, the high LET charged particles produced from neutron irradiation cause many ionizations as they traverse a cell, and so double-strand breaks of the DNA molecule are possible. DNA repair of double-strand breaks are much more difficult for a cell to repair, and more likely to lead to cell death.
DNA repair mechanisms are quite efficient, and during a cell's lifetime many thousands of single strand DNA breaks will be repaired. A sufficient dose of ionizing radiation, however, delivers so many DNA breaks that it overwhelms the capability of the cellular mechanisms to cope.
Heavy ion therapy (e.g. carbon ions) makes use of the similarly high LET of 12C6+ ions.
Because of the high LET, the relative radiation damage (relative biological effect or RBE) of fast neutrons is 4 times that of X-rays,
meaning 1 rad of fast neutrons is equal to 4 rads of X-rays. The RBE of neutrons is also energy dependent, so neutron beams produced with different energy spectra at different facilities will have different RBE values.
Oxygen effect.
The presence of oxygen in a cell acts as a radiosensitizer, making the effects of the radiation more damaging. Tumor cells typically have a lower oxygen content than normal tissue. This medical condition is known as tumor hypoxia and therefore the oxygen effect acts to decrease the sensitivity of tumor tissue. The oxygen effect may be quantitatively described by the Oxygen Enhancement Ratio (OER). Generally it is believed that neutron irradiation overcomes the effect of tumor hypoxia, although there are counterarguments
Clinical uses.
The efficacy of neutron beams for use on prostate cancer has been shown through randomized trials. 
Fast neutron therapy has been applied successfully against salivary gland tumors. See also the NCI Salivary Cancer Page.
Adenoid cystic carcinomas have also been treated.
Various other head and neck tumors have been examined.
Fast neutron centers.
Several centers around the world have used fast neutrons for treating cancer. Due to lack of funding and support, at present only three are active in the USA.
The University of Washington and the Gershenson Radiation Oncology Center operate fast neutron therapy beams and both are equipped with a Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) to shape the neutron beam.
University of Washington.
The Radiation Oncology Department operates a proton cyclotron that produces fast neutrons from directing 50.5MeV protons onto a beryllium target.
The UW Cyclotron is equipped with a gantry mounted delivery system an MLC to produce shaped fields. The UW Neutron system is referred to as the Clinical Neutron Therapy System (CNTS).
The CNTS is typical of most neutron therapy systems. A large, well shielded building is required to cut down on radiation exposure to the general public and to house the necessary equipment.
A beamline transports the proton beam from the cyclotron to a gantry system. The gantry system contains magnets for deflecting and focusing the proton beam onto the beryllium target. The end of the gantry system is referred to as the head, and contains dosimetry systems to measure the dose, along with the MLC and other beam shaping devices. The advantage of having a beam transport and gantry are that the cyclotron can remain stationary, and the radiation source can be rotated around the patient. Along with varying the orientation of the treatment couch which the patient is positioned on, variation of the gantry position allows radiation to be directed from virtually any angle, allowing sparing of normal tissue and maximum radiation dose to the tumor.
During treatment, only the patient remains inside the treatment room (called a vault) and the therapists will remotely control the treatment, viewing the patient via video cameras. Each delivery of a set neutron beam geometry is referred to as a treatment field or beam. The treatment delivery is planned to deliver the radiation as effectively as possible, and usually results in fields that conform to the shape of the gross target, with any extension to cover microscopic disease.
Karmanos Cancer Center / Wayne State University.
The neutron therapy facility at the Gershenson Radiation Oncology Center at Karmanos Cancer Center/Wayne State University (KCC/WSU) in Detroit bears some similarities to the CNTS at the University of Washington, but also has many unique characteristics.
While the CNTS accelerates protons, the KCC facility produces its neutron beam by accelerating 48.5 MeV deuterons onto a beryllium target. This method produces a neutron beam with depth dose characteristics roughly similar to those of a 4MV photon beam. The deuterons are accelerated using a gantry mounted superconducting cyclotron (GMSCC), eliminating the need for extra beam steering magnets and allowing the neutron source to rotate a full 360° around the patient couch.
The KCC facility is also equipped with an MLC beam shaping device, the only other neutron therapy center in the USA besides the CNTS. The MLC at the KCC facility has been supplemented with treatment planning software that allows for the implementation of Intensity Modulated Neutron Radiotherapy (IMNRT), a recent advance in neutron beam therapy which allows for more radiation dose to the targeted tumor site than 3-D neutron therapy.
KCC/WSU has more experience than anyone in the world using neutron therapy for prostate cancer, having treated nearly 1,000 patients during the past 10 years.
Fermilab / Northern Illinois University.
The Fermilab neutron therapy center first treated patients in 1976, and since that time has treated over 3,000 patients. In 2004, it was revived after becoming managed by Northern Illinois University.

Colin Manlove

Colin Nicholas Manlove (born 1942) is a literary critic with a particular interest in fantasy. Modern Fantasy: Five Studies (1975, published as by C. N. Manlove), which considers at length works by Charles Kingsley, George MacDonald, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and Mervyn Peake was written at a time when "no serious study of the subject fantasy literature has appeared". In it he posits a definition of fantasy as: 
A fiction evoking wonder and containing a substantial and irreducible element of supernatural or impossible worlds, beings or objects with which the mortal characters in the story or the readers become on at least partly familiar terms.
His conclusion, however, is negative: each of the five major writers whose work he considered failed to sustain their original vision.
He was a lecturer in English Literature at the University of Edinburgh until his retirement in 1993.

Men's Island Soccer Organization

Men's Island Soccer Organization is an amateur soccer league that is located in Oahu, Hawaii. Within this soccer league there are two divisions, Division I and Division II each of 12 teams.
In the past, there were two different seasons in a year. The spring season would start in the middle of January and end in the first week of July. The fall season would begin in August and end in December. In the present day, the league president issued a change of the scheduling process. Instead of having two short seasons, they decided to make one long season which lasts approximately a year. The new season starts in the August and ends in July. This new long soccer season started in the Fall of 2006.
The soccer participants vary in age. The ages range from high school students to adults in their 40s. Soccer has been on the rise in Hawaii and allowing high school players to participate with older, mature, and better players will allow them to learn and grow. Soccer players out of high school or just out of college have an opportunity to keep up their fitness as well as their soccer abilities.
Within the league there is a tournament in which all teams participate in. This gives a chance to the second division teams to prove that they are worthy to be in the first division. At the end of every season, the team from Division II who wins their season is promoted to Division I. The team in Division I with the least points at the end of the season will be relegated and sent down to Division II.

National colours of the United Kingdom

The national colours of the United Kingdom are usually identified as the combination of red, white and blue in that order. These colours are the same as in the flag of the United Kingdom. The colours of the flag are in turn taken from the flags of England (white and red) and of Scotland (blue and white), which have been combined to form the union flag; to this was later added a red saltire for Ireland.
In maps of the 19th and 20th centuries, the territories of the British Empire were usually coloured red or pink. Historically, the British Armed Forces fought in red, a traditional colour that remains to this day in formal and ceremonial uniforms. Militarily, and in other contexts, the single chief colour associated with the UK is therefore red, such as in the famous British Army red coats.
In many international team sports the different countries of the United Kingdom are represented by separate teams. In those where the United Kingdom competes as one team, either under its own name or that of Great Britain (such as in the Olympic Games), colours used for the team are red, white and blue, where the blue is often a very dark blue. In motor racing, the national colour of the United Kingdom is green; the origin of this British racing green has its own, somewhat uncertain background.
At sea.
At sea, 'national colours' refer to a distinctive flag used to demonstrate a vessel's country of origin. In 1867, an Order in Council defined that ""the Red Ensign and Union Jack with a White Border continuing as at present the national colours for all British Ships"". The white bordered Union Jack is commonly known today as the Pilot Jack.

A Elbereth Gilthoniel

A Elbereth Gilthoniel is an Elvish hymn to Varda (Elbereth) in J. R. R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings".
Text.
There are three versions of this iambic tetrameter hymn, the first of which being the largest portion of Sindarin found in the novel:
Musical settings.
In 1967 Donald Swann published a musical rendition in the musical score of the song cycle "The Road Goes Ever On". He and Donald Elvin also recorded this song cycle on an LP record. The LP also included a recording of Tolkien reading this prayer. "The Road Goes Ever On" was republished in 1978 and 1993, and the recording was released as a CD in 1993. The CD contained only the song cycle (including "A Elbereth Gilthoniël"), but not Tolkien's reading of the prayer.
The 1981 dramatisation by BBC Radio of the Lord of the Rings, included a version composed by Stephen Oliver which was released as the second track of soundtrack album, which itself is included in some commercial versions of the BBC's production. 
In 2006, The Tolkien Ensemble and Christopher Lee released a collection of previously released songs; "Complete Songs & Poems" which included four different musical renditions of the poem, one of which marked as number III, is the complete poem sung by Signe Asmussen, a soprano.
A rendition composed by David Long with Plan 9 (David Donaldson, Steve Roche, and Janet Roddick) is briefly heard in the Extended Edition of "", where Sam and Frodo encounter "wood elves" who are singing the hymn while leaving Middle-earth. The complete song ("Passing of the Elves" / "Elvish Lament") is included in "The Complete Recordings" edition of the soundtrack for the film.
Australian composer Laura Bishop has recently composed her own rendition of this elven hymn. Beginning with a solo by a soprano it then repeats with an SATB choir.

Nguyễn Chí Thiện

Nguyễn Chí Thiện (27 February 19392 October 2012) Vietnamese-born American dissident, activist and poet who spent a total of twenty-seven years in prison.
Biography.
Thien was educated in private academies and was a supporter of Viet Minh revolutionaries in his early life. In 1960, however, he challenged the official account of World War II – that the Soviet Union had defeated the Imperial Army of Japan in Manchuria, ending the war – while teaching a high school history class. Thien told the class that the United States defeated Japan when they dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
He was sentenced to two years imprisonment, and served three years and six months in reeducation camps. Thien began composing poems in prison and committed them to memory. After a brief release in 1966, he was jailed again for composing politically irreverent poems. He denied the charges, and spent another eleven years and five months in labor camps.
In 1977, two years after Saigon fell, Thien and other political prisoners were released to make room for officers of the Republic of Vietnam. Thien used the opportunity of his release to write down the poems he had thus far committed solely to memory.
Two days after Bastille Day, on 16 July 1979, after having been thwarted from his initial plan to enter the French embassy because of the closely guarded compound, Thien dashed into the British embassy in Hanoi with his manuscript of four hundred poems and the cover letter drafted in French as it was meant for the original destination.
British diplomats welcomed him and promised to send his manuscript out of the country. When he got out of the embassy, security agents were already waiting for him at the gate. He was imprisoned yet again, this time in the Hoa Lo prison ("Hanoi Hilton") for six years, then six more years at other Communist prisons in northern Vietnam.
During this imprisonment, Thien’s poems which made their way to the West were translated into English by Huỳnh Sanh Thông of Yale University. The work won the International Poetry Award in Rotterdam in 1985. He was adopted as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International in 1986. Twelve years after bringing his manuscript to the British Embassy, he was released from jail. He lived in Hanoi under close watch by the authorities, but his international following also kept an eye on Thien.
Human Rights Watch honored him in 1995. That year he also permitted to emigrate to the United States with the intervention of Noburo Masuoka, a retired Air Force colonel and career military officer who was drafted into the U.S. Army following internment in Heart Mountain camp for Japanese Americans in 1945.
He immediately wrote "Hoa Dia Nguc II", poems composed in his memory (as he was not allowed pen and paper in prison) from 1979 to 1988. They were published in bilingual editions (Vietnamese and English) then again in its Vietnamese entirety in 2006. 
In 1998 Nguyen Chi Thien was awarded a fellowship from the International Parliament of Writers. He lived in France for three years, writing the Hoa Lo Stories, prose narrative of his experiences in prison. These were translated and published in English as the "Hoa Lo / Hanoi Hilton Stories" by Yale Southeast Asia Studies in 2007. 
Thien's original manuscript was returned to him in early 2008 by the widow of Prof. Patrick Honey of the University of London, who had shared the material with many Vietnamese exiles, but always guarded the original work.
Nguyen Chi Thien died in Santa Ana, California on 2 October 2012.

GAMAGO is a company that was started in 2001 by Greg Long and Chris Edmundson. The pair began silkscreening t-shirts with artwork from their friends in Long’s San Francisco garage. They wanted to help promote the San Francisco art scene and distract from their day jobs. Shortly after starting, one of Long’s friends, artist Tim Biskup joined them, and printed shirts with Biskup’s Gama-Goon character. The three of them together took the basement hobby and turned it into a company. In 2006, Tim Biskup ceased his creative involvement with the company. 
In 2006, GAMAGO shifted their focus from apparel to gifts for the home and kitchen. 2009 saw the release of The Flipper, a guitar shaped spatula. The success of The Flipper helped to cement GAMAGO's name among the top gift-ware design companies.

The Black Major

The Black Major (published name John Shepherd (name changed to protect his family ) is a fictional character from the Action Force series depicted in the "Battle Action Force" comic books and Palitoy action figures as a European version of G.I. Joe.
In West Germany, he was known as the Schwarzer Major.
Characterisation.
The Black Major was depicted in the "Battle Action Force" comic book series as a member of the Red Shadows and second-in-command to Baron Ironblood.
Limited information is given in to his background on the file cards that accompanied the action figure although it is variously believed that he was either a traitor from Action Force (as a former British Special Boat Service marine commando) or was otherwise a captive of Baron Ironblood, subsequently brainwashed into: "a dedicated and ruthless follower. Brilliant military commander and tactician. Totally emotionless. The Black Major carries out Baron Ironblood's orders without question."
His primary military specialty is stated as "Combat Control" though all other information is classed as "Classified". However, his real name is referred to a number of times in his extensive back story.
Court martialled "in absentia" by his former Royal Marine unit and disowned by his family following his treachery, his name is derived from the Spanish phrase "el comandante negro", which was shouted at him by Andean soldiers in his first engagement for the Red Shadows.
Graphic representation.
The figure is a repaint of the Action Force commander (a figure only available via a mail-in offer), giving some weight to his characterisation as a former Action Force member.
The figure was provided with an AK-47 assault rifle and a red paper codebook. Using the codebook one was able to decipher the characters used on Red Shadow vehicles (such as Shadowtrak), decals and armour as well as occasional Red Shadow wording used in the comic books.
Transition to Cobra.
The Black Major was one of the key characters retained in the storylines surrounding the transition from the Red Shadows to Cobra. The evolution of both the action figures and the comic strip to conform to G. I. Joe in the mid-1980s saw a storyline where Ironblood betrayed the Red Shadows, leaking information about their bases and intentions to the UN. As the Shadows were wiped out, Ironblood constructed a new identity for himself, becoming Cobra Commander, and creating Cobra as a new enemy force.
While Red Jackal sought his own revenge and instead became Destro, the Black Major, Red Laser and Red Vulture stuck together and went in search of Cobra Commander. The Major finally confronted him at gunpoint during a battle with Action Force. He was taken aback when Cobra Commander addressed him by his real name of "Shepherd" and was even more surprised to recognise his voice as Ironblood's. He dropped his guard long enough for Cobra Commander to squirt him with cobra venom from a ring on his finger. He was rescued by Red Laser and Red Vulture.
Determined on revenge, the Black Major now led his own group of surviving Red Shadows and fought his own war against Cobra, independent of Action Force. The Major's next appearance in "Battle Action Force" was in "Showdown for the Shadows", in which he sought one final counter-attack against the combined AF forces. The Black Major escaped with a fortune in valuables.
On another occasion, he destroyed the so-called School for Snakes where Cobra had assembled child prodigies from all over the world and brainwashed them into serving Cobra Commander. A chance encounter with Destro lead to them plotting to assassinate Cobra Commander, though this truce was short-lived.
His final appearance was in the Battle Action Force Annual 1987 "Storm Shadow" story where, acting upon a tip-off, Cobra Commander dispatched Storm Shadow to eliminate the Black Major. He barely escaped with his life and was not heard from again.
Wilder Vaughn.
Certain writers in the Devil's Due G.I. Joe universe have recently revived storylines incorporating elements of the Red Shadows faction led by a Wilder Vaughn. The back-story of that character is not fully explained and it has been speculated by online fan communities that Wilder Vaughn could be a new manifestation of the Black Major. However, there are a number of retroactive continuity differences between the two as a result of the divergent comicbook heritage of Action Force and G.I. Joe/Cobra.

St. Wilfrid Club

The St. Wilfrid Club is a club for organists of recognized standing in the greater New York City and tri-state area. The object of the club is to promote social discourse among its members and to further the interests of organists.
Background.
The club was founded in 1908, following an October 5 dinner meeting convened by Dr. Leighton Parks, rector of St. Bartholomew's Church, to introduce 17 of the city's leading church musicians to Arthur S. Hyde, Leopold Stokowski's successor as St. Bartholomew's organist. The founders named the club in honor of Saint Wilfrid (sometimes spelled Wilfred or Wilfrith, c.633 – c.709), an influential English bishop known for his strong advocacy of sacred music. In a typical year, the club would have three formal dinner meetings with invited guest speakers.
Membership.
The club was limited to 25 members at first, and membership was still just 30 in 1939. Today there are three classes of membership: resident, non-resident, and honorary. Resident members, currently limited to 85 in number, consist of organists of recognized standing who work in greater New York City or within a radius of 60 miles of New York City. While election to the club is limited to those who meet these requirements, there are no other exclusions to club membership. Prospective members are proposed and seconded by current resident members in good standing and voted on by the entire membership. New members may be nominated as vacancies occur.
Resident members, upon removing from the greater New York City area, automatically become non-resident members. Other organists of recognized standing, who reside at a considerable distance from New York, may be elected to non-resident membership through the same process as that for resident members.
Organists of note, outstanding professional musicians who are not organists, and others who have rendered distinguished service in any line of endeavor, may be elected honorary members through the same process of balloting as that for resident members.
A non-resident member returning or moving to work in the greater New York City area may request to be transferred to the resident member list, if and when there is a vacancy.
Members in all three categories enjoy equal club access and privileges, except the holding of office and voting, which is confined to resident members. Regular attendance is expected as evidence of active interest in the club. If unable to attend a meeting, resident and non-resident members are asked to notify the Secretary of the club. Those who consistently fail to reply may be asked to resign in order to secure openings for proposals of candidates who may have expressed interest in membership.
While there are no secret rituals or other specific attributes of membership, the identity of the club's living members are not generally known except to other members.
Governance.
The club is governed by a Chair, elected for a term of two years (originally one year), together with an executive committee consisting of two members, who are also elected for a term of two years. Two years must have elapsed before the Chair, or members of the executive committee may be re-elected. Two other officers maintain the operation of the club: a recording secretary and a treasurer, who are each elected for a term of two years, but who are eligible for re-election without restriction.
Notable Past Members.
Some notable Chairs of the past include Gerrit Smith, J. Christopher Marks, Walter Henry Hall, T. Tertius Noble, R. Huntington Woodman, Walter C. Gale, Samuel A. Baldwin, Seth Bingham, John Hyatt Brewer, Edward Shippen Barnes, S. Lewis Elmer, Norman Coke-Jephcott, Maurice Garabrant, Hugh Porter, Vernon de Tar, Ray F. Brown, T.

Hancock.
Other notable members have included James M. Helfenstein, William C. Carl, Clement R. Gale, Clarence Eddy, C. Whitney Coombs, Horatio Parker, Bruno Siegfried Huhn, Clarence Dickinson, Frank Sill Rogers, Charles Ives, Clifford Demarest, Gaston Dethier, Mark Andrews, David McK. Williams, Charles M. Courboin, Ernest White, Édouard Nies-Berger, Carl Weinrich, Virgil Fox, and Searle Wright.

The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (musical)

The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a musical comedy based on the novel by Mark Twain with the book by Ken Ludwig and music and lyrics by Don Schlitz.
The musical is the story of a fourteen-year-old boy growing up in the heartland of America. This Broadway musical version of Mark Twain's novel is set in 1840 in St. Petersburg, Missouri, a bustling town on the banks of the Mississippi River. In the course of the story, Tom matches wits with his stern Aunt Polly, falls in love with the beautiful, feisty Becky Thatcher, and goes on the adventure of his life with Becky and Huckleberry Finn. Along the way he meets a terrifying villain named Injun Joe, Tom's bratty half-brother Sid, and all the other boys and girls in the village.
Productions.
"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" opened on Broadway at the Minskoff Theater on April 26, 2001 and closed on May 13, 2001, after 21 performances and 34 previews. The musical was directed by Scott Ellis with choreography by David Marques, and featured Joshua Park as Tom Sawyer, Kristen Bell as Becky Thatcher, Jim Poulos as Huckleberry Finn, with Tom Aldredge (Muff Potter), Stephen Lee Anderson (Doc Robinson/Pap), Jane Connell (Widow Douglas), John Dossett (Judge Thatcher) and Kevin Serge Durand (Injun Joe).
Synopsis.
In 1840, Tom Sawyer is fishing outside St. Petersburg, Missouri as his friends arrive, and the children play a game of Robin Hood ("Hey, Tom Sawyer"). Tom’s Aunt Polly sends him to school, where he tricks the schoolmaster, Mr. Dobbins, into letting the class have the day off. Aunt Polly, Mr. Dobbins and the preacher, Reverend Sprague lament that they "Can’t Do A Thing About the Boy".
Aunt Polly orders Tom to whitewash a fence in front of their house, and Tom’s half-brother, Sid, is happy. Frustrated, Tom is frustrated and plans to run away (Here’s My Plan).
As Tom procrastinates, he meets a beautiful newcomer, Becky Thatcher and they are mutually attracted. The town's outcast and Tom's best friend Huckleberry Finn says that painting the fence looks like fun. Tom then tricks his friends into painting the fence for him, and paying ("Smart Like That").
At night, Tom and Huck visit the local graveyard and see Injun Joe, a troublemaker, fighting with Doc Robinson ("Hand All Clean"). Joe murders Doc Robinson and the boys run away and swear in blood to keep quiet forever about what they saw ("The Vow"). Injun Joe has a vagrant, Muff Potter, blamed for the murder.
On the way to church, Aunt Polly and Judge Thatcher, single parents, lament about "Raising A Child By Yourself". In church, Tom tries to impress Becky by fooling Reverend Sprague into giving him the "Bible Prize" ("It’s In The Bible").
Tom tries to convince a fearful Huck to learn to read. When Huck saves old Widow Douglas from the advances of the town drunk, she offers to teach him to read and to live in her home. However, Huck declines ("It Just Ain’t Me").

Ilka Grüning

Ilka Grüning (September 4, 1876 – November 11, 1964) Born in Vienna in the old Austrian-Hungarian Empire. She was one of many Jewish actors and actresses that were forced to flee Europe when the Nazis came to power in 1933.
Career.
She continued making silent movies in Germany into the 1920s. In 1920, she appeared in the film "Die Bestie im Menschen" based on a Émile Zola novel. This were two of 11 films she appeared in that year alone. Grünig appeared in a couple of Veidt's "Christian Wahnschaffe" movies; "Weltbrand" in 1920 and "Die Flucht aus dem goldenen Kerker" in 1921. In 1922, she had a small part as a landlady in "Lady Hamilton" starring Veidt as Lord Horatio Nelson. This was one of four movies that she and Hans Twardowski appeared in together; F.W. Murnau's drama "Phantom", "Es leuchtet meine Liebe" and "Der Falsche Dimitri".
In 1923, she portrayed Frau Gött in Max Mack's "Das Schöne Mädel". Later that year, she portrayed the wife of Johann Friedrich Schiller in "Friedrich Schiller - Eine Dichterjugend". Next she played Rosalindes' mother in Max Mack's "Die Fledermaus" (this was the 5th film she did with the German director). In 1924, she appeared in F.W. Murnau's drama "Die Finanzen des Großherzogs"; (this was the third film she made with Murnau, the legendary German director).
In 1925, Grüning appeared in the silent "Die freudlose Gasse", directed by the legendary Georg Wilhelm Pabst, which featured a 20-year old Greta Garbo. Marlene Dietrich was also in the film, uncredited as "Maria's friend", making this the only film featuring both Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo. Dietrich is the dark-haired friend of Maria's who actually catches Garbo when she collapses from hunger in the Vienna butcher shop line. The following year, Grüning appeared in her third Pabst' movie "Geheimnisse einer Seele". In 1927, Grünig appeared in "Halloh - Caesar!" which S.Z. Sakall helped write. Later that year, she and Sakall appeared together in "Familientag im Hause Prellstein".
In 1929, Grüning appeared in her first 'talkie', "Melodie des Herzens". It would be three years before she appeared in another film. In 1932, she received a part in Max Neufeld's "Hasenklein kann nichts dafür", which would be her last movie in Germany.
Grüning, had played Strindberg and Ibsen for legendary German director Max Reinhardt and had run the second most important drama school in Berlin, left Germany after Hitler and the Nazis came to power. After arriving in America, she received help from the European Film Fund in resettling to America. It would be nine years before she appeared in another movie.
With the outbreak of World War II and the need for older German women for war movies, Grüning started receiving parts. Her first Hollywood movie was in 1941 as Erwin Kalser's husband in Warner Bros.' war drama "Underground" starring Philip Dorn and Martin Kosleck (as the evil Nazi Colonel Heller) and Ludwig Stössel (who would play her husband in Casablanca).
Grüning was busy in 1942. First, Grüning (playing Anna) and Stössel appeared in the Oscar-nominated "Kings Row" starring Ronald Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Claude Rains. She then played Christian Rub's wife in the spy thriller "Dangerously They Live" starring Nancy Coleman and Raymond Massey. This was followed by playing the wife of Karl Pfeiffer, a German millionaire living in America (played by Charles Winninger) in "Friendly Enemies". Grüning (playing Aunt Sophie) and Stössel appeared together again in a Sonja Henie film "Iceland". Next, playing a Gestapo impostor, she appeared in "Desperate Journey" with Ronald Reagan and Errol Flynn.
Also in 1942, at the age of 66, the oldest actor in the movie, Grüning received the role of Mrs. Leuchtag, who along with her husband (played by Ludwig Stössel) are leaving Europe for America in "Casablanca". She has only one scene (a total of 30 words) in the movie when she and her husband are having a drink in Rick's Cafe with their good friend Carl the waiter (S.Z. Sakall) and struggling a bit with their English. Her husband (Ludwig Stössel) asks her for the time, "Liebchen - sweetnessheart, what watch?" She answers, "Ten watch" and he replies, "Such watch?" Carl assures them they will get along beautifully in America.
In 1943, Grüning received a bit part as George Tobias's mother in "This Is the Army". Next she appeared in "The Strange Death of Adolph Hitler" with Stössel and Twardowski. Grünig received bit parts in "Madame Curie" starring Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon (as the Curies). Grünig appeared in only one movie in 1944 as Mrs. Vronsky in the drama "An American Romance" starring Brian Donlevy, Ann Richards, and John Qualen. Grüning would not get another part until 1946 when she received a bit part in the mystery "Murder in the Music Hall". She received a couple of other small parts that year; the first as Herman Bing's wife in "Rendezvous 24.
Next Grüning and Stössel got to play husband and wife again. Instead of being the Leuchtags, they were now the Muellers in "Temptation" starring Merle Oberon, George Brent and Paul Lukas. The following year, she played Paul E. Burns's wife in the film-noir "Desperate" which featured Raymond Burr. Playing Mattie, she appeared next in "Repeat Performance". In 1948 appeared in "Letter from an Unknown Woman" starring Joan Fontaine. Later she played a German woman in Billy Wilder's comedy romance "A Foreign Affair" starring Marlene Dietrich. She also had a small part in the M-G-M musical "Words and Music".
The following year, she played a grandmother in the film-noir "Caught" starring James Mason and Barbara Bel Geddes. Later that year, Grüning and Stössel appeared in their last film together when they received roles in the drama "The Great Sinner" starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner. She played another old women in "Mr. Soft Touch" with Glenn Ford.
In 1950, she received a good part as Edgar Bergen's wife in the adventure film "Captain China" starring John Payne and Gail Russell. She had another good role in the film-noir "Convicted" starring Glenn Ford and Broderick Crawford. The following year, she appeared as Brett King's mother in "Payment on Demand" with Bette Davis. Her last Hollywood movie was as Mama Ludwig, Griff Barnett's wife, in the western "Passage West" starring John Payne.
Like many German and Austrian actors, Grüning went back to Berlin in the 1950s, but found that Germany was not the same country she had left. Many former Nazis returned and it became difficult for Grünig to integrate back into the film industry. She did, at age 76, appear in a small Swiss movie in 1952 called "Die Venus vom Tivoli", which was her last movie. After this Grüning returned to America.
Death.
Grüning died on November 11, 1964, in Los Angeles, at the age of 88. She was cremated and her ashes rest in Columbarium of Faith in Woodlawn Cemetery in Santa Monica, California. Actors Paul Henreid and George Bancroft are also buried here.

Tyrone Brown

Tyrone Brown (born 1973) is an African-American man from Texas who, in 1990, was sentenced to a life term in a Texas maximum security prison and was kept incarcerated for 17 years after testing positive once for smoking marijuana while on probation for robbing a man of two dollars at the age of 17. No one was hurt in the robbery, and Brown had voluntarily returned the wallet to the victim. Brown's case attracted some attention in the press in 2006, and he was later granted a conditional pardon by Texas Governor Rick Perry. He was released on March 16, 2007.
Press attention.
Brown's case was contrasted in the press with the case of an influential white defendant; both defendants were sentenced by the same judge, Keith Dean. The other man had committed murder by shooting an unarmed prostitute in the back (and then taking money from his victim after shooting him), and had then violated his parole by repeatedly testing positive for cocaine use over a period of several years, breaking through the glass door of a woman's home to confront her in a dispute, living with at least two men who had multiple criminal convictions, and being arrested for crack cocaine possession while driving a congressman's car. Probation records indicated that the man had failed five drug tests over a three-year period. In contrast with the way Brown was treated, the other defendant was never sent to jail and received an early lifting of all of the usual conditions of probation.
After Brown's case and the contrasting treatment of the other man became well known, in part due to a feature report on the ABC News television program "20/20", the judge involved in the two cases, Keith Dean, failed to win re-election to his position.
Original crime.
When he was 17 years old, Brown and another 17-year-old committed a robbery. Brown and his partner confronted a man with a pistol and demanded that he give them his wallet. The victim handed his wallet to Brown, and after removing the two dollars that it contained, Brown returned the wallet to him. Brown was a high-school dropout and had been a victim of child abuse by his father, who had reportedly beat him. Judge Keith Dean in Dallas, Texas originally sentenced Brown to 10 years of probation for the crime, before changing his sentence to life in prison after he tested positive once for marijuana use.

Raymond Khoury

Raymond Khoury (b. 1960 in Beirut, Lebanon) is a screenwriter and novelist, best known as the author of the 2006 "New York Times" Bestseller "The Last Templar".
Biography.
Early years.
Raymond Khoury was born in Lebanon but spent his teenage years in Rye, New York, where his family moved in 1975 to escape the Lebanese Civil War. Khoury returned to Lebanon after his graduation from Rye Country Day high school to attend the American University of Beirut and study architecture. During his time as a student, he also illustrated several children's books for the Oxford University Press Middle East office. Shortly after Khoury completed his degree, fighting broke out in Lebanon again, and in February 1984 he was evacuated from Beirut by the U.S. Marine Corps aboard a Chinook helicopter.
Currently, Khoury lives in London, with his wife and two young daughters.
Early career.
After a few months working at a small architectural firm in London, Khoury moved to Fontainebleau, France, where he earned an MBA from the European Institute of Business Administration (INSEAD). Upon his graduation he returned to London, working in investment banking. It was through this unlikely career path that Khoury became interested in writing, as Khoury was introduced to a Wall Street investment banker who developed screenplays in his spare time. Taking an idea of his that the two jointly developed, Khoury wrote a screenplay which was a finalist for a Fulbright Fellowship in Screenwriting. His second writing attempt, a semi-autobiographical account of his college years in war-torn Lebanon was also shortlisted for the same award.
In 1996, Khoury optioned the rights to the Melvyn Bragg novel "The Maid of Buttermere" and wrote the screenplay adaptation of it. Robert De Niro soon announced to Variety that he would be producing the movie and playing the lead role. Khoury has also written for the BBC shows "Spooks" (known as "MI:5" in the United States) and "Waking the Dead".
Novels.
During the early days of his screenwriting career, before he was even able to attract an agent, Khoury completed a screenplay he called "The Last Templar", an "epic" thriller about a search for the lost treasure of the Knights Templar. After eighteen months of research and writing, Khoury lent the script to a friend who immediately suggested that Khoury turn it into a novel. With Khoury's permission, the friend submitted the screenplay to a book agent. Within a few months (in 1996), Khoury was offered a six-figure advance by a major publisher to create a book based on the screenplay, with the stipulation that the book exclude all references to religion. Although at that time Khoury had not sold any of his other writing work, he declined the money and the book deal.
His pet screenplay set aside, Khoury worked on his screenplays for several years, building a successful career for himself in London and in Hollywood, before a new agent at the William Morris Agency, who he had joined at that point, read his screenplay of "The Last Templar" and encouraged him to adapt it into a novel. Finally, in September 2002, Khoury began researching and writing the novelized version of his screenplay, which took three years to write. The novel sold quickly, and was first released in the UK in 2005. It soon became a "New York Times" Bestseller, spending 11 weeks on the hardcover fiction list, and a Number 1 bestseller overseas. It has been translated into thirty-eight languages and published in over forty countries. Although the book shares some general thematic concepts with those of "Da Vinci Code" author Dan Brown, Khoury devised his plot before Brown's novels were released.
Following the release of "The Sanctuary" in August 2007, Khoury wrote his third novel titled "The Sign". This was published in the United States on May 19, 2009 as both a traditional hardcover book, and as an electronic book. "The Templar Salvation", a sequel to "The Last Templar", was published in 2010.
Personal.
Khoury lives in London with his wife and their two young daughters. Khoury was raised Roman Catholic but does not consider himself to be particularly religious.

Rue Gouraud

Rue Gouraud is a mixed residential and commercial street in Gemmayzeh, a neighborhood in the Achrafieh district of Beirut in Lebanon. Gemmayze, and Rue Gouraud specifically, is Beirut's artistic bohemian quarter, an old district full of narrow streets and beautiful historic buildings from the French era. The neighborhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on Rue Gouraud, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. The street, which was named after the French General Henri Gouraud, has become one of Beirut's trendiest streets with numerous high-end restaurants and tourism facilities. 
Rue Gouraud is known especially for its culinary scene that is popular with Beirut's fashionistas. The street borders the Saifi Village and runs east of Beirut Central District extending from Avenue Georges Haddad and reaching the Corniche du Fleuve. In 2004, "Travel + Leisure" magazine called the street "SoHo by the Sea," due to its colorful and chic cafés amid 1950's apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops. 
Similarly to Rue Monot, this area is old and historic, and was designed well before the invention of automobiles, so going by car through its narrow streets requires a lot of patience. Local complaints has risen recently of foreigners buying up and renovating properties, leading to gentrification and pricing out many locals from living there. so
The street leads to the Saint Nicolas Stairs, also known as Escalier de l'Art, where art festivals are held every year. The stairs also lead to Rue Sursock. The street is also walking distance from Rue Monnot and Saifi Village.

Gidgiddoni

According to the Book of Mormon, Gidgiddoni () was a prophet and the commander of the Nephite armies in the war between the Nephites and the Gadianton robbers. He was appointed in about AD 16 by Lachoneus to lead the armies because he had the spirit of revelation and of prophecy. He demonstrated his wisdom by refusing the people's desire to wage offensive war against the robbers.
Gidgiddoni at their head, the Nephites were able to defeat the robbers and end the life of Giddianhi in AD 19. The robbers tried again in AD 21, with a man named Zemnarihah leading them, but Gidgiddoni knew of the robbers' weaknesses and exploited them, making it impossible for them to retreat, and the Nephites took as many prisoners as would surrender, while putting the rest to death. Zemnarihah, however, was hanged.
Finally, after the destruction of the band of robbers, Lachoneus and Gidgiddoni brought peace to the Nephites. Gidgiddoni is not mentioned further in the scripture after this.

<doc id="9676629" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9676629" title="Salabhanjika">
Salabhanjika

Salabhanjika or Shalabhajika refers to the sculpture of a woman, displaying stylized feminine features, standing near a tree and grasping a branch. The name of these figures comes from the Sanskrit "śālabañjika" meaning 'breaking a branch of a sala tree'. They are also known as "madanakai", "madanika" or "shilabalika".
Artistic tradition.
The salabhanjika is a standard decorative element of Indian sculpture, a graceful stone sculpture representing a young female under a stylized tree in various poses, such as dancing, grooming herself or playing a musical instrument. The salabhanjika's female features, like breasts and hips, are often exaggerated. Frequently these sculpted figures display complex hairdos and an abundance of jewelry.
The salabhanjika concept stems from ancient symbolism linking a chaste maiden with the sala tree or the asoka tree through the ritual called "dohada", or the fertilisation of plants through contact with a young woman. The symbolism changed over the course of time and the salabhanjika became figures used as ornamental carvings, usually located in the area where worshipers engage in circumambulation, near the garbhagriha of many Hindu temples. 
Placed at an angle, salabhanjika figures also were used in temple architecture as a bracket figures.
Salabhanjikas are also often mentioned in ancient and modern Indian literature.
Locations.
Some of the most renowned salabanjika sculptures are to be found in the 12th-century Hoysala temples of Belur, Halebidu and Somanathapura, in south-central Karnataka. The shalabhanjika on the East gateway (Torana), is the best known sculpture of the Sanchi Stupa near Bhopal, a World Heritage site, built from the 1st to the 12th centuries. One of early examples are the shalabhanjikas of built in Shunga dynasty dating to the 2nd or 1st century BC, found at the Durakhi Devi Temple, after the excavation of Kumhrar, the remains of an ancient city of Pataliputra.
Another less-known location famous for its outstanding salabanjikas is a Chalukya period temple in Jalasangvi, Homnabad Taluk on the Gulbarga-Bidar state highway, at the northern end of Karnataka. Its well-endowed Madanika figures in seductive "tribhanga" poses are "...moon breasted, swan-waisted and elephant-hipped", according to the Indian artistic canons. These older feminine sculptures were the source of inspiration for the later Hoysala bracket-figures.
Related iconography.
The sal tree "(Shorea robusta)" is often confused with the ashoka tree "(Saraca indica)" in the ancient literature of the Indian Subcontinent. The position of the Salabhanjika is also related to the position of Queen Māyā of Sakya when she gave birth to Gautama Buddha under an asoka tree in a garden in Lumbini, while grasping its branch.
Some authors hold that Salabhanjika, as young girl at the foot of a tree, is based on an ancient tree deity related to fertility.

Bird of Ill Omen

Bird of Ill Omen (often referred to as The Bird) was a metalcore band from Florida, USA. The band was only active for a few years in the late 1990s.
History.
Bird of Ill Omen was formed in 1996 by George Rios (drums) and Thomas Rankine (bass guitar). They recruited Joseph Lee Simmons and Damien Moyal. The band went through some line-up changes, including Peter Bartsocas and Andrew Logan on guitars. They did a short tour, and Moyal left the band to pursue musical endeavors in Gainesville (As Friends Rust, Culture). He was quickly replaced by Shane Post.
The band recorded their first full-length album in anticipation of a tour planned with Morning Again for summer 1997. The album was the first release by Eulogy Recordings, and the first 12" vinyl to be released on Think Tank Records. The album was not ready in time for the tour, so they printed a few four-song demos in support of their second tour. When they came back, the band changed drummers. Rios being replaced by Jose. The band went back on tour in winter 1997 with new material, but while touring in Canada, Jose was detained by border patrol and stayed in Canada, leading to the tour's cancellation.

The band recorded an EP, with the CD again released on Eulogy, and the 7" on One Day Savior. The band broke up soon after to pursue other musical and life endeavors.
Rankine and Logan formed Dead Mens' Theory with an occasional participation from Bartsocas.
