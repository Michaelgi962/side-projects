Nepenthes attenboroughii

Nepenthes attenboroughii ( or ), or Attenborough's pitcher plant, is a montane species of insectivorous pitcher plant of the genus "Nepenthes". It is named after the celebrated broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough, who is a keen enthusiast of the genus. The species is characterised by its large and distinctive bell-shaped lower and upper pitchers and narrow, upright lid. The type specimen of "N. attenboroughii" was collected on the summit of Mount Victoria, an ultramafic mountain in central Palawan, the Philippines.
In May 2010, the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University selected "N. attenboroughii" as one of the "top 10 new species described in 2009". The species appeared on the 2012 list of the world's 100 most threatened species compiled by the IUCN Species Survival Commission in collaboration with the Zoological Society of London.
Botanical history.
"Nepenthes attenboroughii" was discovered by Alastair S. Robinson, Stewart R. McPherson and Volker B. Heinrich in June 2007, during a 2 month research expedition to catalogue the different species of pitcher plant found across the Philippine Archipelago. The expedition was initiated after missionaries reported seeing giant "Nepenthes" on the mountain in 2000.
The formal description of "N. attenboroughii" was published in February 2009 in the "Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society". The herbarium specimen "A. Robinson" AR001 is the designated holotype, and is deposited at the herbarium of Palawan State University (PPC), Puerto Princesa City.
Further accounts of this species appeared in McPherson's "Pitcher Plants of the Old World", published in May 2009, and in the December 2009 issue of the "Carnivorous Plant Newsletter".
Description.
"Nepenthes attenboroughii" is a terrestrial upright or scrambling shrub. The stem, which may be up to 3.5 cm thick, is circular in cross section and attains a height of up to 1.5 m.
Leaves and pitchers.
The leaves are coriaceous and sessile or sub-petiolate. The leaves of rosettes are up to 30 cm long and 10 cm wide, whereas those of the scrambling stem are up to 40 cm long and 15 cm wide. The leaves are oblong to elliptic, obtuse at the apex and shortly attenuate at the base, clasping the stem by approximately two-thirds of its circumference and becoming decurrent for 2–3 cm.
"Nepenthes attenboroughii" produces some of the largest pitchers in the genus, sometimes exceeding those of typical "N. rajah" in size, but is not known to have exceeded the size and volume records set by that species. The largest recorded pitcher of "N. attenboroughii" measured more than 1.5 litres in volume, and traps exceeding 2 litres are likely to be produced on occasion. The lower pitchers are brittle and campanulate (bell-shaped), up to 30 cm tall and 16 cm wide and emerge from tendrils that are 30–40 cm long and 4–9 mm in diameter. The tendrils are flattened towards the leaf, making them almost semi-circular in cross section.
The upper pitchers are similar to the lower pitchers, but generally infundibular, to 25 cm tall and 12 cm wide.
Inflorescence.
"Nepenthes attenboroughii" has a racemose inflorescence up to 80 cm long. The male flower spike bears approximately 100 pedicellate flowers on a rachis up to 45 cm long and is recorded to bifurcate on occasion. The flowers lack bracts and produce red tepals that are broadly ovate with an obtuse apex.
The female inflorescence is shorter, to 65 cm long, never bifurcates, and bears up to 70 densely arranged flowers on a compact rachis up to 20 cm long. The tepals are brown to purple, ovate, and have an acute apex.
Distribution and habitat.
This species is endemic to the Victoria Massif in Palawan. There, it grows from 1450 m above sea level to the summit of Mount Victoria at 1726 m. Originally known only from Mount Victoria itself, it has since been found on the largest peak of the Victoria Massif, Mount Sagpaw, and along the connecting ridges from the site of first collection. The species is found among shrubs 0.8–1.8 m tall in relatively scattered populations of plants on rocky, ultramafic soil. It is not sympatric with other "Nepenthes" species and no natural hybrids have been recorded.
The summit flora of Mount Victoria includes "Leptospermum" sp., "Medinilla" spp., "Pleomele" sp., "Vaccinium" sp., various grasses, as well as the sundew "Drosera ultramafica", which grows at similar elevations to "N. attenboroughii".
Conservation.
"Nepenthes attenboroughii" is assessed as Critically Endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) on account of its restricted distribution and the threat posed by plant poachers.
Carnivory.
The pitchers of "N. attenboroughii" are open to the elements and thus often completely filled with fluid. This fluid is viscous in the lower part of the pitcher and watery above, forming two fractions that do not mix. The upper fraction supports populations of pitcher infauna, particularly mosquito larvae, and the pitchers of this species may benefit from both the usual capture of prey as well as the detritus produced by organisms living within the pitcher fluid.
In the latter half of 2009, this taxon received a great deal of publicity in the national press of various countries as a sensational new plant that catches and kills rats. Whilst certainly large enough to trap rodents, no rodents of any kind had, at that time, been observed within the pitchers of this species, as indicated in the type description and through subsequent clarification by the author, Alastair Robinson, who suggested that were rodents to be captured by the plant, it was likely to be through misadventure rather than by design, large bugs and flying insects appearing to be the usual prey.
In October 2012, however, a dead shrew was found in a pitcher of "Nepenthes attenboroughii" during a return expedition to Mount Victoria by Robinson and a group of naturalists. Yet another visit almost two months later, in December 2012, allowed the botanist to assess and document the rate of digestion on video. It was found that the corpse of the shrew had, in the intervening weeks, progressed from a wholly intact state to mere skeletal remains, with only scant viscera and a matte of hair at the bottom of the pitcher still apparent.
Related species.
"Nepenthes attenboroughii" is closely related to the Palawan species, "N. deaniana", "N. leonardoi", "N. mantalingajanensis", "N. mira", and "N. palawanensis" (which produces even larger pitchers), to "N. peltata" from Mindanao, and to "N. rajah" from Borneo.
The stated relationship of this taxon with species from Borneo and Mindanao agrees with observations made in the description of "N. mira", and is further supported in the type description of "N. attenboroughii" by previously overlooked paleogeographical evidence. Based on this evidence, the authors reason that these species, predominantly found growing on ultramafic soils on Palawan and Mindanao, are likely to have arisen as a result of the radiative speciation of a common ancestor in Borneo.

J &amp; H Ritchie Ltd v Lloyd Ltd

J & H Ritchie Ltd v Lloyd Ltd [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/9.html UKHL 9 is a Scottish contract law case, concerning the measure of damages for breach.
Facts.
Mr Ritchie has a business (J&H Ritchie Ltd) on North Arkleston Farm, Paisley. He bought an all in one seed drill and harrow from Lloyd Ltd, based at Hunters Hall, Kelso. It was advertised at a reduced price because it had been repossessed from the previous owner. It did not work. Lloyd Ltd agreed to take it back, investigate, and repair it. Lloyd Ltd returned it, but refused to say what the problem had been, and just said it had been repaired to "factory gate" standard. Mr Ritchie found out informally that two bearings for the rotors of the harrow had been missing. This was a serious defect. Mr Ritchie was concerned that when he had used it, further damage may have been caused, and he would not find out, because he would only start using it the next Spring. He was worried that by this time the manufacturer's guarantee would be affected. So Mr Ritchie rejected the machine.
The question was whether rejecting the equipment was permissible under s 35(6)(a) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. This provides,
Judgment.
The House of Lords all agreed that Mr Ritchie was entitled to reject the equipment, even though it had in fact been repaired. Furthermore Lloyd Ltd were in breach of a separate "inspection and repair agreement" by refusing to say what had been wrong with it. This had arisen when the machinery was taken away. It had to have been an implied term of that agreement that, so long as Lloyd Ltd were performing its duties, Mr Ritchie would not rescind the contract. Mr Ritchie would lose his right to reject the goods. But he could only make that choice when he was fully informed. The law has shown that this is correct.

Tom Baxter (Australian footballer)

Thomas 'Tom' Baxter (born 23 February 1884) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Collingwood and St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Baxter, originally from Maldon, was a Collingwood premiership player in 1910. In the Grand Final he was reported for striking by umpire Jack Elder, and suspended for the entire 1911 VFL season. Collingwood appealed the ban and it was overturned, after teammate Richard Daykin signed a declaration which stated that it was he and not Baxter who had struck Jack Baquie. As Daykin had retired after the Grand Final win, no player was suspended for the incident. This incident is said to be central to, or even the specific origin of, the long-standing rivalry which still exists between the clubs.
A rover, he performed well in 1911 and his 31 goals was enough to top Collingwood's goal-kicking. He finished the year in Collingwood's losing Grand Final team. His performance attracted controversy, with a widespread rumour hinting that he was bribed to play "dead". Baxter twice kicked into the man on the mark in the vital last quarter, as well as missing three easy chances to score a goal. Baxter asked the Collingwood committee to hold an inquiry, saying in his own defence that he had scored Collingwood's only goal of the last quarter, and was one of the few players to gain possession of the ball. The committee cleared Baxter of any wrongdoing, but he was cleared to St Kilda for the 1912 season.

Sydney Rowell

Lieutenant General Sir Sydney Fairbairn Rowell, KBE, CB (15 December 1894 – 12 April 1975) was an Australian soldier who served as Chief of the General Staff from 17 April 1950 to 15 December 1954. As Vice Chief of the General Staff from 8 January 1946 to 16 April 1950 he played a key role in the post-Second World War reorganisation of the Army, and in the 1949 Australian coal strike. However, he is best known as the commander who was dismissed in the Kokoda Track campaign.
As a young officer, Rowell served at Gallipoli but was invalided back to Australia with typhoid fever in January 1916. The end of the war found Rowell junior in rank to his contemporaries with more distinguished war records, but he managed to catch up in the post-war period. Rowell spent five years with the British Army or at British staff colleges, establishing valuable contacts with his British counterparts. In 1939 he was appointed chief of staff of the 6th Division and later I Corps, serving in that capacity in the Battle of Greece and the Syria-Lebanon campaign. In 1942 he commanded I Corps in the Kokoda Track campaign but was sacked. His subsequent rise to become Chief of the General Staff demonstrated that the circumstances of his dismissal in 1942 were indeed extraordinary.
Early life.
Sydney Fairbairn Rowell was born on 15 December 1894 at Lockleys, South Australia, the fourth son of James Rowell, an English-born soldier and orchardist who served as a senator from 1916 to 1922, and his Australian-born second wife Zella Jane née Williams. He acted as an 'unofficial batman' to his father, who was colonel commanding the South Australian Brigade from 1907 to 1911. Rowell was educated at Adelaide High School and was one of the first cadets to enter the Royal Military College, Duntroon when it opened in 1911.
First World War.
On 15 September 1914 Rowell and his classmates were commissioned as first lieutenants in the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF). At the time, Rowell's class had not yet completed its military training. The AIF's commander, Major General William Throsby Bridges, decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he allotted the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the AIF, rather than as staff officers. The cost of this decision was high; of the 134 commissioned in time to serve at the front, 42 were killed and 38 wounded. Cadets were posted to units being formed in their home states, so Rowell was posted to the 10th Infantry Battalion. When he discovered that the 3rd Light Horse Regiment was to be commanded by his cousin, Lieutenant Colonel F. M. Rowell, Sydney obtained permission to swap places with another member of his Duntroon class Lieutenant Eric Wilkes Talbot Smith. It was a fateful decision; Smith was fatally wounded on Anzac Day.
Rowell contracted pneumonia and did not embark with the main body of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment. Instead, he left with its First Reinforcements on HMAT "Thirty-Six" on 21 December 1914. Rowell joined the regiment in Heliopolis in January. The next month he broke his left leg in a riding accident. For a time it looked like Rowell would again miss the embarkation of his regiment, but the intervention of his father ensured that he reached Anzac Cove with the 3rd Light Horse on 12 May 1915. He was evacuated sick to Egypt and then Malta in July, and returned to his regiment at Quinn's Post in August. Rowell was promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 9 September, briefly assuming command of a squadron before becoming the regimental adjutant three days later. In November Rowell was again evacuated to Egypt, this time with typhoid fever, the disease that had killed his cousin. On 20 January 1916, Rowell was returned to Australia. Because of a policy that a regular officer, once invalided to Australia, could not again be posted overseas, Rowell's period of active service was over. He was posted, along with several other Duntroon graduates who had been invalided home, to Duntroon, as an instructor at the Officers' Training School. This was closed in June 1917 and Rowell was posted to the staff of the 4th Military District in Adelaide.
Between the wars.
On 20 August 1919 at the Chalmers Church, North Terrace, Adelaide, Rowell married Blanche May Murison, the daughter of a Scottish engineer. Blanche had served in the Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps in Australia during the war. Due to his brief overseas service, the end of the war found Rowell still a lieutenant and thus junior in rank to his contemporaries but the snail-like pace of promotions between the wars allowed him to gradually catch up. He was promoted to captain on 1 January 1920, major on 1 January 1926, and the brevet rank lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1935, with substantive rank on 1 January 1936. His inter-war career consisted of a long series of staff postings, interspersed with training courses.
In 1924, Rowell passed the staff college examination for one of the two Australian spots. Qualifying in first place gave him a choice between the Staff College, Camberley and its counterpart at Quetta, and Rowell chose the former, attending from 1925 to 1926. At this time, the commandant was Major-General Edmund Ironside; the staff included Colonel J. F. C. Fuller and Lieutenant Colonels Alan Brooke and Bernard Montgomery. Fellow students included Captains Frank Messervy and Francis Tuker. From 1935 to 1937, Rowell was on exchange to the British Army as a staff officer with the 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division. He then attended the Imperial Defence College. The class was a distinguished one, including two Victoria Cross winners, Group Captain Frank McNamara from Australia and Lieutenant Colonel George Pearkes from Canada; other students included Lieutenant Colonel William Slim and Wing Commander Keith Park. For his staff work, Rowell was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honours in 1938.
Rowell returned to Australia to become Director of Military Operations and Intelligence at Army Headquarters in Melbourne but in August 1938 he became staff officer to the Inspector General, Lieutenant-General Ernest Squires, partly because Rowell was recognised as "one of the ablest of the early Duntroon graduates" but also because he had spent five of the previous thirteen years with the British Army or at British staff colleges. The government's decision to appoint a British officer to produce an authoritative report into the Army was widely seen as demonstrating the government's lack of confidence in its own officer corps. Squires' first recommendation was to restructure the military districts into four "commands". This required legislation amending the "Defence Act" and was not implemented until October 1939. The second recommendation was the formation of a regular brigade. The death of Prime Minister Joseph Lyons in April 1939 and his subsequent replacement by Robert Menzies caused this to be shelved.
Second World War.
Libya.
When the 6th Division was formed in October 1939, Sir Thomas Blamey appointed Rowell as its GSO1 (chief of staff). Rowell joined the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and was given the AIF service number VX3. Gavin Long described Rowell as "clear and incisive in thought, sensitive in feeling, frank and outspoken in approach to men and to problems. Five recent years of service either at English staff colleges or on exchange duty made it probable that wherever he went his opposite numbers in British formations would be men with whom he had previously worked and played." Comparing him to the AA&QMG, Colonel George Alan Vasey, Long noted that both "were not only efficient soldiers but men of commanding temperament and talent".
Rowell was promoted to colonel on 13 October 1939, and when the government decided to form I Corps in April 1940, Blamey was given the command and Rowell became brigadier, general staff (BGS), with the rank of brigadier. Blamey and Rowell prepared I Corps for operations as best they could, completing the force's structure and integrating new units as they arrived in the Middle East. Rowell strove to establish good relations with the British Army, while occasionally having to remind them that the AIF was answerable to its own commander in chief and its own government. Rowell's efforts to create an administrative headquarters to free the I Corps staff for operational duties foundered on Blamey's reluctance to delegate authority. The best that he could achieve was the creation of a Base and Line of Communications Units command under Brigadier Allan Boase but I Corps remained responsible for organisation and training.
I Corps' part in the Western Desert Campaign was brief. Its headquarters opened near Benghazi on 15 February 1941, replacing British XIII Corps. Rowell studied the prospects of an advance on Tripoli, but the headquarters was recalled to Egypt on 24 February to participate in the Battle of Greece. Nonetheless, for his part, Rowell was mentioned in despatches, and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.
Greece.
In Greece, I Corps was employed as such for the first time. The campaign was another short one, but very trying on the participants. Just three days after headquarters opened on 5 April 1941, the Germans broke through and the corps was thrown into a retreat that eventually led to its re-embarkation. Blamey and his staff worked under tremendous pressure; the operational situation was precarious; and German air attacks were frequent. Rowell later wrote: Tempers flared when I Corps headquarters was ordered to evacuate to Egypt. Blamey's aide recalled: If Rowell felt that Blamey had shown a lack of moral courage in failing to stand up to the political and military superiors who had directed the ill-fated campaign, Blamey felt that the campaign had revealed flaws in Rowell's character. He wrote to the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee: For his part in the campaign in Greece, Rowell was mentioned in despatches a second time.
Syria.
I Corps was alerted to take part in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign although, Blamey having been promoted to Deputy Commander in Chief Middle East Command, it lacked a commanding officer. Apparently, General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson believed that I Corps' loss of transport and signal equipment precluded it from participating in the campaign from the outset. Instead, Wilson attempted to exercise command from the King David Hotel. This proved to be a serious error, as his staff were preoccupied with political and administrative issues, and were too remote from the battlefields to exercise the close command required — something that Rowell foresaw. Following a series of reverses, Rowell predicted on the 16 June that "it won't be long now." I Corps headquarters was sent for on 18 June, and Lieutenant General John Lavarack assumed command that day.
Defence of Australia.
In August 1941, Rowell returned to Australia to take up the post of Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS), with the rank of major general. He expected that his main task would be to support the AIF; but it turned out the primary concern was the looming war with Japan, which broke out soon after. It was at this juncture that Rowell was approached by Major General George Vasey, who had a scheme to retire all officers over the age of fifty, and making Major General Horace Robertson Commander in Chief. Presumably Vasey expected Rowell, as a fellow Duntroon graduate, to be sympathetic. A heated argument ensued, ending with Rowell telling Vasey that "if he weren't so bloody big, I'd toss him out of the room". Rowell immediately went to Sturdee, who had Lavarack with him, and told him what had transpired.
In Blamey's subsequent shake-up of higher command arrangements, Rowell was appointed to command I Corps. This was his first command since his three-day stint in command of a light horse squadron at Gallipoli. He became the first Duntroon graduate to command a corps, and the first to be promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. The old I Corps headquarters was largely absorbed into Lavarack's new First Army headquarters, so a new one was formed from Headquarters, Southern Command. Initially located in Melbourne, it soon moved to Esk, Queensland.
Kokoda Track.
On 31 July 1942, Blamey informed Rowell that I Corps headquarters would be sent to Port Moresby to control operations in New Guinea. Rowell arrived in Port Moresby on 13 August 1942 and assumed command of New Guinea Force from Major General Basil Morris. Rowell's I Corps headquarters took over operational control from Morris's, which became that of ANGAU. The only warning that Morris had of Rowell's arrival was a message from the DCGS, Vasey, which simply said: "Syd is coming". The situation was dire. Japanese were steadily advancing on Port Moresby along the Kokoda Trail and were also threatening Milne Bay and Wau. Rowell and his staff were all seasoned officers with combat experience in the Middle East and the Battle of Malaya and "brought to New Guinea skill and organisation that Morris and his staff had been unable to provide". However, the main body of Rowell's staff did not arrive until 17 August. Rowell turned down a suggestion from Blamey that he needed additional base staff to cope with his administrative problems, given that a corps headquarters was a tactical headquarters, intended to operate as part of an army, with the latter handling most of the administrative work. Rowell's staff gradually discovered how enormous the task before them was; they had few maps, the only transport aircraft were destroyed in a Japanese raid, and the supplies that had been forwarded by air to Kokoda could not be located.
Rowell refused to give General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) in Brisbane a "ball to ball" description of the action, sending only factual information at stated times. Failure to keep GHQ up to date could only lead to fears of the worst, which were confirmed when Major General George Kenney reported that in his opinion Port Moresby would soon fall unless something drastic was done, and Rowell was "defeatist". On 17 September, the General MacArthur discussed the situation in New Guinea with Prime Minister John Curtin on the secraphone. He pointed out that while the Japanese faced all the same difficulties as the Australian troops fighting on the Kokoda Track, the Japanese were advancing and the Australians were retreating, and the whole situation seemed to MacArthur to be a lot like the Malaya. He recommended that General Blamey be sent up to New Guinea to take personal command of the situation.
Blamey took over command of New Guinea Force, but not I Corps. The difference was academic insofar as there was only one staff. Blamey wrote a letter to Rowell to explain the situation in advance of his arrival in Port Moresby on 23 September:
Rowell took it very badly. He wrote to Major General Cyril Clowes at Milne Bay:
On 25 September, at MacArthur's suggestion, Blamey flew to Milne Bay with Brigadier General Kenneth Walker and ordered Clowes to send a force by air to Wanigela. This would be an important step forward. Rowell, Kenney noted, was "not even consulted anymore". Rowell was furious at Blamey bypassing him. Blamey reported back to Prime Minister Curtin that:
Exile.
On further consideration, Blamey decided that he might need Stevens, "a first rate fighter", and that it would be better to send Rowell to the Middle East, although such a move would involve Rowell being reduced in rank to major general so as to be junior to Morshead. Rowell paid a visit to MacArthur in Brisbane on his way south. MacArthur was unimpressed. He told the Prime Minister that "Rowell's attitude to a superior officer in a theatre of active operations was quite unpardonable" and hoped for Rowell's sake that there would be no enquiry into the matter. MacArthur was dissatisfied with the way that Rowell had prosecuted the campaign in Papua, and was opposed to Rowell returning to New Guinea. Curtin granted Rowell an interview on 3 October. He explained to Rowell that Blamey had gone to New Guinea on his orders and had expressed the fullest confidence in his commanders in New Guinea. Not until the end of January did the Prime Minister finally decide to send Rowell to the Middle East, as a major general.
By the time Rowell arrived in the Middle East, Morshead and most of the troops had departed. Rowell filed regular reports on the progress of the war in the Mediterranean, and processed Australian prisoners of war who had been liberated from the Italians. In December 1943, Rowell took up the appointment as Director of Tactical Investigation at the War Office in London vice Lieutenant General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen at the instigation of Richard Casey. Despite the important sounding title and a "high powered staff", the job was a sinecure. When Blamey and Curtin visited London in May 1944, Rowell was on his "best behaviour". For his services at the War Office, Rowell was awarded a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1946 New Year Honours.
Post war.
Blamey's appointment as Commander in Chief was terminated in November 1945 and the new Prime Minister Ben Chifley appointed Sturdee in his place. Rowell was recalled from Europe to assume the new post of Vice Chief of the General Staff. He dropped in on Chifley in Canberra at the Prime Minister's invitation. "I hate bloody injustice!" Chifley told him. Rowell presided over the Army's transition to peacetime.
Coal strike.
In June 1949, while Rowell was acting Chief of the General Staff, the country was rocked by the 1949 Australian coal strike. The strike began when stocks of coal were already low, especially in New South Wales and rationing was introduced. The Chifley government turned to the Army to get the troops to mine coal. This became possible when the transport unions agreed to transport coal that was mined. Rowell delegated responsibility for planning and organising the effort to Lieutenant General Berryman, while Rowell flew "top cover", liaising with the government ministers in Sydney. Rowell managed to get the government to pay a bonus to soldiers mining coal, and persuaded the government to allow soldiers to have beer in their canteens, although the local civilians had none.
Soldiers began mining at Muswellbrook and Lithgow on 1 August and by 15 August, when the strike ended, some 4,000 soldiers and airmen were employed. They continued work until production was fully restored.
Chief of the General Staff.
Sturdee retired in April 1950 and Rowell became the first Duntroon graduate to become Chief of the General Staff, the post of Vice Chief disappearing for a generation. Within months, Australian troops would be committed to the Korean War. Rowell paid visits to Korea in 1952 and 1953. He presided over the Korean War expansion of the Regular Army, the National Service Scheme, and the re-establishment of the women's services. Rowell, as Chief of the General Staff, was Army's chief mourner at Blamey's funeral in 1951, also serving as one of the pallbearers along with Frank Berryman, William Bridgeford, Edmund Herring, Iven Mackay, Leslie Morshead, John Northcott, Stanley Savige, Vernon Sturdee, and Henry Wells. For his services as Chief of the General Staff, Rowell was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division) in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 1953.
Later life.
Rowell retired from the Army on 15 December 1954, following a ceremony at Duntroon, where his career had begun over 43 years before. He turned to gardening, cricket, horse-racing, reading, and crossword puzzles. He became a director of Smith, Elder & Co. in 1954 and of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in 1956, serving as its chairman from 1957 to 1968. From 1958 to 1968 he was chairman of the Australian Boy Scouts' Association and a member of the Rhodes Scholarships Selection Committee for Victoria. He was offered but declined the post of Australian consul general in New York. In 1974 he published his memoirs, entitled "Full Circle" — the only Chief of the General Staff to have done so. Rowell died at his South Yarra home, twelve days before Lady Rowell, and was cremated. They were survived by their daughter. Sir Ivor Hele's portrait of Rowell is held by the Australian War Memorial, as are his papers.

Marie Lesueur

Marie Lesieur (8 October 1799, Paris - 6 April 1890, Ixelles, Brussels), known as Lesueur, was a French ballet dancer.
Life.
The daughter of Hébert Lesieur and Marie Calliaud, Lesieur made her debut at the Théâtre de Marseille in 1816, as a 'sujet de la danse'. In the course of a production of the ballet "La Naissance de Vénus" ("The Birth of Venus") in July 1817 she was noted for turning her back on the public, in an inconvenient attitude, but she was pardoned for this and quickly became Marseilles's favourite dancer. Two years later she moved to Brussels to join the ballet troupe formed there by Jean-Antoine Petipa with some of the dancers from Marseille. The "Almanach des spectacles" for 1820 stated:
She made her Brussels debut at the Théâtre de la Monnaie on 20 May 1819 in the ballet "Almaviva et Rosine" and was an immediate and massive success with the public. The 1822 "Revue des spectacles" described her as a dancer
In a production of the ballet "Psyché" in April 1823, Mlle Lesueur was the victim of a set-operator's negligence:
Very quickly she won a reputation as a major dancer, but also as a woman of character, who was in the ballet come rain or shine. The famous painter Jacques-Louis David made her the model for Venus in his 1824 "Mars Being Disarmed by Venus" (in which Lucien Petipa also appeared as Cupid). In January 1826 Mlle Lesueur fell seriously ill and, after a few brief returns to the stage, she announced that her health would not allow her to continue her career. With her protector, the comte van Gobbelschroy, interior minister to William I, she set up home in the rural property (later known as the château Malou) he had acquired at Woluwe-Saint-Lambert near Brussels. Van Gobbelschroy committed suicide in 1850, having used up his fortune setting up the first candle factories in France and Belgium. Some sources state that he and Lesueur married, though the comte's death certificate states he was unmarried. After the comte's death, Mlle Lesueur devoted herself to acts of charity, taking a small apartment in rue de la Grosse Tour, before moving to Ixelles. She died in complete poverty aged 90 in a small house on rue Keyenveld. In 1824 a lithograph by Eeckhout portrayed her as Venus.

The Chameria Human Rights Association () is a non-governmental organization, based in Washington, DC, United States, which protects and lobbies for the rights of Cham Albanians.
Chams in the United States.
Muslim Cham Albanians were expelled from Greece in 1944, and were forcefully sent to Albania. But, many Chams were persecuted also by the Albanian Communist regime, forcing them to leave. The majority of Cham Albanians that left Albania and Greece, migrated to the United States. They were mainly concentrated in Chicago, as well as Boston and New York. They managed to retain their tradition and language, and published the first Cham Albanian newspaper, in 1966, named "Chameria - motherland" (), edited by Bilal Xhaferri.
Chameria Human Rights Association.
In such situation, where Cham Albanians in the United States are the fourth most numerous population of Chams, after Albania, Turkey and Greece, there was created the Chameria Human Rights Association. It describes as its mission: the right of return of Cham Albanians "to their homes in Greece and live there in peace and prosperity with their Greek brothers"; the Property Rights; Other Legal Rights "ensuring to the Cham people all other legal and minority rights deriving from the Greek Constitution and Laws, the Treaties and laws of the European Union, and other rights originating from international treaties and conventions to which Greece is a party"; and the conservation and propagation of the rich history, culture, language, and other cultural aspects of the Cham people.

Livingstone Tower

The Livingstone Tower is a prominent high rise building in Glasgow, Scotland and is a part of the University of Strathclyde's John Anderson Campus, one of the 2 campuses the university operates from. The building was named after David Livingstone. The address of the building is 26 Richmond Street, Glasgow. 
The building is a notable landmark in the eastern side of the city centre, and its high position on the drumlin of Rottenrow means it can be seen from some considerable distance throughout the city's East End. It was also among the earliest high-rise commercial buildings to go up in the city centre in the post-war period, pre-dated only by St Andrew's House (1964), Fleming House (1961), and the Royal Stuart Hotel (1963)—the latter having been owned by Strathclyde University in the 1980s and early 1990s as a student hall of residence.
Construction & History.
The Livingstone Tower was constructed between 1962 and 1964 as Alec House - a commercial office building in a partnership between Glasgow Corporation, the former Royal College of Science and Technology and a commercial development company. The site was formerly occupied by a row of tenement houses, but these were cleared after Townhead was declared a Comprehensive Development Area (CDA) in the 1950s. As part of this development - inspired by the findings of the 1945 Bruce Report, central areas of the city were re-zoned for commercial or educational use.
The building is of reinforced concrete construction, and was state of the art in its construction methods at the time - being clad with a curtain wall in opaque dark green glass spandrel panels framed by orange metal uprights. With its original commercial use in mind it featured an advanced elevator system for its day - four Otis "Autotronic" gearless lifts (also used in St. Andrew House on Sauchiehall Street) which were capable of responding to the traffic flow within the building at specific times of the day. The building is electrically heated and was also intended to feature a restaurant on the ground floor which the University later turned into a student refectory. 
The tower sits atop a 3 storey concrete podium shared with the neighbouring McCance Building, an NCP car park, and a row of retail units at street level on George Street. There is also private car parking for Glasgow City Council. There was also a raised empty concrete podium between the tower and the McCance Building upon which the University would later add the Collins Building in 1973.
In 1965, one year after the creation of the University of Strathclyde, the building had still not attracted any private tenants. The adjacent McCance Building which was being built at the same time to house the University's library, arts and social studies departments. The two buildings ultimately became part of a plan to expand the University by adding more buildings and learning space, and so it was decided the building would be leased to the University. This lease was set to last 100 years and is due to end in 2064. The University dropped the original "Alec House" name and renamed the building after David Livingstone who studied at the Anderson's medical school between 1836 and 1839. At the time the building was used to expand the departments that were to be included in the McCance building. Since then it has grown and is now home to five of the university's departments.
Recent History.
In 2000 the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship [http://www.strath.ac.uk/huntercentre/] was built by converting the former roof terrace into offices, thus creating a fourteenth floor, accessed by stairs from the thirteenth floor. It was all part of the Strathclyde Entrepreneurship Initiative. The Hunter Centre provides elective classes related to different areas of business. It was named after Sir Tom Hunter after his £5 million endowment to the university to help fund the new centre. In 2011 they relocated to the 199 Cathedral Street building, being replaced with the Strathclyde Business School Centre for Corporate Connections department.
The building received a mild refubishment in 2010, which saw the outer spandrel panels replaced, a new modern languages centre built and the floors redesignated by transposing the Ground Floor to Level 1, thus the former roof terrace becoming Level 15. The studios of the radio station Celtic Music Radio are currently on the 14th Floor of the building within the Hunter Centre.
Under the University's £300m masterplan for campus consolidation and renewal, it has proposed to vacate the entire Livingstone Tower/McCance/Collins Building complex and relocate the Humanities and Social Sciences departments to the Lord Hope Building in Cathedral Street. A revised plan was released in 2011 which showed that the tower would remain in use until the year 2023, after which the building would be returned to Glasgow City Council for future redevelopment.
Location.
The building is located within the John Anderson Campus of the University of Strathclyde. It is part of a mixed-use development which includes the University's own McCance and Collins Buildings, a two-storey sub-surface NCP car park, and a row of retail units at street level on George Street. There is also private car parking for Glasgow City Council. 
The tower itself (arguably designed in the International Style) follows a contrasting architectural paradigm to the rest of the attaching buildings, which are of a distinctly Brutalist style - fashionable in the 1960s.
The London Twin.
The Livingstone Tower has a near identical twin in London. The former headquarters of UNISON at 1 Mabledon Place along Euston Road known as Unison House is almost identical in design, sharing the same hexagonal planform, although being of 10 stories high instead of 13, and is clad in bare concrete instead of metal panels. Their striking similarities suggest that the two buildings are clearly the work of the same architect.
Virtual Version.
Games developer Chris Sawyer, an alumnus of the University of Strathclyde, based one of the skyscraper sprites appearing in the computer game Transport Tycoon on Livingstone Tower.

The Livingstone Tower is the home to many departments including:

Helston Town Band

Helston Town Band is a brass band in the Cornish town of Helston.
History.
Helston Town Band has a rich history, which can be traced back to the turn of the century; there are members of the current band whose family connections extend back four generations. Inevitably, during World War II the band reformed with new members and in 1946 numbers were consolidated when most of its pre-war members returned from active service. The band enjoyed steady progress at this time, which culminated in 1951 when it reached the National 3rd Section Finals at Belle Vue, Manchester.
In 1967, the band came under the direction of Edward Ashton, with whom the band gained much success and a reputation for consistently playing music to a high standard. Edward led the band to numerous successes in both local and regional contests, until his retirement in November 2002 after an incredible 35 years.
Following his retirement, the band appointed John Hitchens as their new Musical Director. The band has continued to flourish under John’s direction: in 2003, they were crowned Cornish First Section Champions, and in 2004 they gained promotion to the National First Section.
In 2006, the band were crowned West of England First Section Champions, and received an invitation to compete in the National First Section Finals in Harrogate, where they achieved a commendable 7th place. The band went on to achieve third place at the West of England First Section Championships in 2007, and were delighted to become West of England First Section Champions once again in 2008.
These excellent results meant that Helston Town Band earned promotion and is competing in the Championship Section in 2009 for this first time in its entire history.
Flora Day.
Helston Town Band is extremely proud of its association with Helston Flora Day, when our 'quaint old Cornish town' throngs with thousands of people. Flora Day is usually held on 8th May unless this falls on a Sunday or Monday.
Brighouse and Rastrick Band recorded its own version of 'The Floral Dance' in 1977 with the help of Terry Wogan, which reached No. 2 in the singles chart. But it is only Helston Town Band who can claim ownership of the authentic Furry Dance. Passed down through the generations of Helston bandsmen and women, no written music exists. The Flora Dance is sacred to Helston Town Band and has never been written on manuscript to ensure it remains only within the band.
On Flora Day, there are four dances throughout the day led by the band:
The first and last dances are led by Helston Senior Band, who are joined by the Junior Band, Beginners Band and invited guest players for the remaining dances. In total, senior band members cover an incredible 16 miles - playing the Flora Dance nearly 1000 times.

Jean-Antoine Petipa

Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Petipa (16 February 1787, Paris – 28 July 1855, Saint Petersburg) was a French ballet dancer and the father of Marius Petipa.
Life.
Aged 8 he was in the revived production of the ballet "Psyché" by Pierre Gardel, put on at the Opéra de Paris five years earlier. His débuts are only known from the programme of ballets and in a petition addressed by his father to the minister of the interior in 1799 with a view to obtaining one year's leave for his children, who were studying at the Opéra's dance school. Shortly afterwards young Petipa was enrolled in the troupe of Filippo Taglioni which criss-crossed Europe from 1807 after the closure of many Parisian theatres by imperial decree. The troupe set up a base in Kassel from 1810 to 1812 but left this city when France invaded Prussia on the eve of the invasion of Russia. It then went to look for other engagements, staying in Vienna and Naples.
Petipa was then taken on as a ballet master at Lyon for the 1813/14 season. He then hosted the Swedish prince Bernadotte and the troupe the prince had formed, then headed the ballet at the Théâtre-Français in Hamburg several times. In January 1814 Petipa and his troupe put on a series of productions at Brussels, then moved to Paris on the reopening of the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin. Premier danseur in the new troupe, Antoine Petipa began composing ballets such as "Les Six ingénus" (music by Alexandre Piccinni) and "Le Berger de la Sierra Morena" (1815).
Taken on as ballet master at the Théâtre de Marseille, Petipa had his eldest son Lucien in 1815 and Marius in 1818. In 1819, Petipa was recalled to Brussels as ballet master at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, remaining there until 1831. Summoned to Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux, Petipa returned to Brussels between 1833 and 1835 before moving to Bordeaux, where Lucien became premier danseur. The family then embarked for the United States of America in 1839, where they had a triumphal tour. On their return to Brussels between 1841 and 1843, Petipa put on new ballets there. In 1847 Petipa and his son Marius set up home in Saint Petersburg, where the father became professor to the Imperial School of Dance and the son began the brilliant career that would lead to his international renown.
Among his Russian disciples: Lev Ivanov, Pavel Gerdt, Timofey Stukolkin etc.

Water sensor

The Water in Fuel Sensor or WiF sensor indicates the presence of water in the fuel. It is installed in the fuel filter and when the water level in the water separator reaches the warning level, the Wif sends an electrical signal to the ECU or to dashboard (lamp).
The WiF is used especially in the Common Rail engines to avoid the Fuel injector damage. 
The WiF sensor uses the difference of electric conductivity through water and diesel fuel by 2 electrodes.
First generation WiF sensors use a potting resin to isolate the electronic circuit, while the latest generation of Wif sensors (the WS3 sensor in Surface-mount technology) are made totally without leakage using an innovative co-moulding process.
The latest generation of WiF sensors have a high resistance to vibrations and to thermal excursion cycles.
The main automotive WiF designer and producer is SIGMAR.

Jocko ou le Singe du Brésil

Jocko ou le Singe du Brésil ("Jocko or the Monkey of Brazil") was a two act play by Edmond Rochefort, inspired by a novel of Charles de Pougens (1824).
Plot.
A rich Portuguese man travelling to Brazil captures a monkey which, during the Atlantic crossing, saves the man's child from shipwreck and dies in doing so. In the second production the public demanded that the monkey survive.
Ballet.
The play gave rise to a ballet by Frédéric-Auguste Blache, with music by Alexandre Piccinni and sets by Pierre-Luc-Charles Cicéri. The ballet was first put on at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin on Wednesday, 16 March 1825. Its main interpreters were Charles-François Mazurier and Louise Pierson.
The success of the ballet, a true bridge between the Enlightenment and Romanticism, was so great that many theatres in Paris and the French provinces put on the original version or competing works inspired by the same theme. There were over 160 productions in a single year. The Duchesse de Berry assisted in the first production in person and the success was such that many things, such as dresses, fans, hairstyles and even a type of bread were nicknamed "jocko". It was revived three times that year and had many imitators. Jules Perrot, also in 1825, put on his version at the Théâtre de la Gaîté, entitled "Sapajou". 
The following year, Jean-Antoine Petipa put on his version at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, with Laurençon in the lead rôle, Filippo Taglioni reprised the theme at Stuttgart in "Lanina ou le Singe brésilien" and Antoine Titus put it on in Berlin.
"Jocko ou le singe du Brésil" saw a long success, even being put on the municipal theatre in Tunis at the end of the century. It was one of the precursors for the 20th century fashion for tales of humanised monkeys like "King Kong" and "Planet of the Apes".

Controlled Ground Water Area

A controlled ground water area (CGWA) is a category defined by the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) of the state of Montana. A CGWA must satisfy a set of criteria, including ground water withdrawals in excess of recharge; excessive declines in ground water levels or pressures; possibility of contaminant migration; or the existence of significant disputes within the area concerning priority of rights, amounts of water being used, or priority of type of use.
Once a CGWA is established, anyone wishing to drill a well must first apply for and receive a Permit for Beneficial Water Use from the DNRC. Some CGWAs have additional restrictions.

Bacterioplankton

Bacterioplankton refers to the bacterial component of the plankton that drifts in the water column. The name comes from the Ancient Greek word ' ('), meaning "wanderer" or "drifter" (Thurman, 1997), and "", a Latin neologism coined in the 19th century by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg. They are found in both seawater and freshwater.
Bacterioplankton occupy a range of ecological niches in aquatic systems. Many are saprotrophic, and obtain energy by consuming organic material produced by other organisms. This material may be dissolved in the medium and taken directly from there, or bacteria may live and grow in association with particulate material such as marine snow. Many other bacterioplankton species are autotrophic, and derive energy from either photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. The former are often categorised as picophytoplankton, and include cyanobacterial groups such as "Prochlorococcus" and "Synechococcus". Bacterioplankton also play roles in ecological pathways such as nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, remineralisation and methanogenesis.
Like other small plankton, the bacterioplankton are preyed upon by zooplankton (usually protozoans), and their numbers are also controlled through infection by bacteriophages.

Anglerfish

Anglerfishes are members of the teleost order Lophiiformes . They are bony fishes named for their characteristic mode of predation, in which a fleshy growth from the fish's head (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure.
Anglerfish are also notable for extreme sexual dimorphism seen in the suborder Ceratioidei, and sexual parasitism of male anglerfish. In these species, males may be several orders of magnitude smaller than females. 
Anglerfish occur worldwide. Some are pelagic, while others are benthic; some live in the deep sea (e.g., Ceratiidae) while others on the continental shelf (e.g., the frogfishes Antennariidae and the monkfish/goosefish Lophiidae). Pelagic forms are most laterally compressed, whereas the benthic forms are often extremely dorsoventrally compressed (depressed), often with large upward-pointing mouths.
Evolution.
A mitochondrial genome phylogenetic study suggested the anglerfishes diversified in a short period of the early to mid Cretaceous, between 130 and 100 million years ago.
Ranging in color from dark gray to dark brown, these carnivores have huge heads that bear enormous, crescent-shaped mouths full of long, fang-like teeth angled inward for efficient prey grabbing. Their length can vary from to over with weights up to .

Anatomy.
Most adult female ceratioid anglerfish have a luminescent organ called the esca at the tip of a modified dorsal ray (the illicium, or "fishing rod"). The organ has been hypothesized to serve the obvious purpose of luring prey in dark, deep-sea environments, but also serves to call males' attention to the females to facilitate mating. The source of luminescence is symbiotic bacteria that dwell in and around the esca. In some species, the bacteria recruited to the esca are incapable of luminescence independent of the anglerfish, suggesting they have developed a symbiotic relationship and the bacteria are unable to synthesize all of the chemicals necessary for luminescence. They depend on the fish to make up the difference. Electron microscopy of these bacteria in some species reveals they are Gram-negative rods that lack capsules, spores, or flagella. They have double-layered cell walls and mesosomes. 
In most species, a wide mouth extends all around the anterior circumference of the head, and bands of inwardly inclined teeth line both jaws. The teeth can be depressed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but prevent its escape from the mouth. The anglerfish is able to distend both its jaw and its stomach, since its bones are thin and flexible, to enormous size, allowing it to swallow prey up to twice as large as its entire body.
Behavior.
Swimming and energy conservation.
Many anglerfish species are deep-sea dwellers, which poses a challenge to ecologists who hope to study and observe the fish. Anglerfish morphology reflects the value of energy conservation for these organisms which often live in extremely prey-scarce environments. Some researchers suggest this is why many ceratioids minimize their energy use by remaining lethargic and using a lie-and-wait hunting strategy. Anglerfish are particularly well suited to conserve energy because they are able to hunt and forage while remaining lethargic, devoting just 2% of energy intake to swimming. 
In one rare ROV observation of an "in-situ" anglerfish, researchers observed several rapid swimming and avoidance behaviors. In 74% of the video footage, the fish was observed passively drifting. Occasionally, it would also exhibit rapid burst swimming. While drifting, the fish weakly beat its pectoral fins in a behavior known as sculling. The sculling behavior observed is suggested as necessary to keep the fish in a neutral position in the water and to counteract any displacing currents. The bursts of fast swimming typically last less than five seconds. The swimming behavior in this video is similar to that seen in other "in-situ" footage of a ceratioid anglerfish. 
Another "in-situ" observation of three different whipnose anglerfish showed unusual upside-down swimming behavior. Fish were observed floating upside-down completely motionless with the illicium hanging down stiffly in a slight arch in front of the fish. Notably, the illicium was hanging over small visible burrows. The observers suggested this is one effort to entice prey and is another example of low-energy opportunistic foraging and predation. When the ROV approached the fish, they exhibited burst swimming, still upside-down.
Predation.
The name "anglerfish" derives from the species' characteristic method of predation. Anglerfish typically have at least one long filament sprouting from the middle of their heads, termed the illicium. The illicium is the detached and modified first three spines of the anterior dorsal fin. In most anglerfish species, the longest filament is the first. This first spine protrudes above the fish's eyes and terminates in an irregular growth of flesh (the esca), and can move in all directions. Anglerfish can wiggle the esca to make it resemble a prey animal, which lures the anglerfish's prey close enough for the anglerfish to devour them whole. The jaws reflexively shut upon contact to the tentacle.
Some deep-sea anglerfish of the bathypelagic zone emit light from their escae to attract prey. This bioluminescence is a result of symbiosis with bacteria. Although the mechanism by which they are harnessed by ceratioids is unknown, the bacteria have been speculated to enter the esca from the seawater through small pores. Once within it, they can multiply until their density is such that their collective glow is very bright.
Because anglerfish are opportunistic foragers, they show a range of preferred prey with fish at the extremes of the size spectrum, whilst showing increased selectivity for certain prey. One study examining the stomach contents of threadfin anglerfish off the Pacific coast of Central America found these fish primarily ate two categories of benthic prey: crustaceans and teleost fish. The most frequent prey were pandalid shrimp. Interestingly, 52% of the stomachs examined were empty, supporting the observations that anglerfish are low energy consumers.
Reproduction.
Some anglerfish, like those of the ceratioid group (Ceratiidae, or sea devils), employ an unusual mating method. Because individuals are locally rare, encounters are also very rare. Therefore, finding a mate is problematic. When scientists first started capturing ceratioid anglerfish, they noticed that all of the specimens were female. These individuals were a few centimetres in size and almost all of them had what appeared to be parasites attached to them. It turned out that these "parasites" were highly reduced male ceratioids. This indicates the anglerfish use a polyandrous mating system.
In certain ceratioids, parasitic reproduction is required. Free-living males and non-parasitized females in these species never have fully developed gonads. Thus, males never mature without parasitizing a female and die if they are unable to find one. At birth, male ceratioids are already equipped with extremely well-developed olfactory organs that detect scents in the water. Males of some species also develop large, highly specialized eyes that may aid in identifying mates in dark environments. The male ceratioid lives solely to find and mate with a female. They are significantly smaller than a female anglerfish, and may have trouble finding food in the deep sea. Furthermore, the growth of the alimentary canals of some males becomes stunted, preventing them from feeding. Some taxa have jaws that are never suitable or effective for prey capture. These features necessitate that the male quickly find a female anglerfish to prevent death. The sensitive olfactory organs help the male to detect the pheromones that signal the proximity of a female anglerfish. 
However, the methods by which anglerfish locate mates are variable. Some species have minute eyes unfit for identifying females visually, while others have underdeveloped nostrils, making it unlikely that they effectively find females using olfaction. When a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single individual female with up to eight males in some species, though some taxa appear to have a one male per female rule. 
Parasitism is not the only method of reproduction in anglerfish. In fact, many families, including Melanocetidae, Himantolophidae, Diceratiidae, and Gigantactinidae, show no evidence of male parasitism. Females in some of these species contain large, developed ovaries and free-living males have large testes, suggesting these sexually mature individuals may spawn during a temporary sexual attachment that does not involve fusion of tissue. Males in these species also have well-toothed jaws that are far more effective in hunting than those seen in parasitic species. 
Finally, some researchers suggest sexual parasitism may be an optional strategy in some species of anglerfishes. In the Oneirodidae, females have been reported in "Leptacanthichthys" and "Bertella", which were parasitized, and others which were not, but still developed fully functional gonads. One theory suggests the males attach to females regardless of their own reproductive development if the female is not sexually mature, but when both male and female are mature, they will spawn then separate. 
One explanation for the evolution of sexual parasitism is: The relative low density of females in deep-sea environments leaves little opportunity for mate choice among anglerfish. Females remain large to accommodate fecundity, as is evidenced by their large ovaries and eggs. Males would be expected to shrink to reduce metabolic costs in resource-poor environments and would develop highly specialized female-finding abilities. If a male manages to find a female parasitic attachment, then it is ultimately more likely to improve lifetime fitness relative to free living, particularly when the prospect of finding future mates is poor. An additional advantage to parasitism is that the male’s sperm can be used in multiple fertilizations, as he stays always available to the female for mating. Higher densities of male-female encounters might correlate with species that demonstrate facultative parasitism or simply use a more traditional temporary contact mating. 
The spawn of the anglerfish of the genus "Lophius" consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material wide and greater than long. The eggs in this sheet are in a single layer, each in its own cavity. The spawn is free in the sea. The larvae are free-swimming and have the pelvic fins elongated into filaments. Such an egg sheet is rare among fish.
Threats.
Northwest European "Lophius" spp. are listed by the ICES as "outside safe biological limits". Additionally, anglerfish are known to occasionally rise to the surface during El Niño, leaving large groups of dead anglerfish floating on surface.
In 2010, Greenpeace International added the American angler ("Lophius americanus"), the angler ("Lophius piscatorius"), and the black-bellied angler ("Lophius budegassa") to its seafood red list, which is a list of fish commonly sold worldwide which have a very high likelihood of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.
Human consumption.
One family, the Lophiidae, is of commercial interest with fisheries found in north-western Europe, eastern North America, Africa, and the Far East. In Europe and North America, the tail meat of fish of the genus "Lophius", known as monkfish or goosefish (North America), is widely used in cooking, and is often compared to lobster tail in taste and texture. In Asia, especially Korea and Japan, monkfish liver is considered a delicacy.

Phototaxis

Phototaxis is a kind of taxis, or locomotory movement, that occurs when a whole organism moves towards or away from stimulus of light. This is advantageous for phototrophic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for photosynthesis. Phototaxis is called positive if the movement is in the direction of increasing light intensity and negative if the direction is opposite.
Two types of positive phototaxis are observed in prokaryotes. The first is called scotophobotaxis (from the word "scotophobia"), which is observed only under a microscope. This occurs when a bacterium swims by chance out of the area illuminated by the microscope. Entering darkness signals the cell to reverse flagella rotation direction and reenter the light. The second type of phototaxis is true phototaxis, which is a directed movement up a gradient to an increasing amount of light. This is analogous to positive chemotaxis except that the attractant is light rather than a chemical.
Phototactic responses are observed in many organisms such as "Serratia marcescens", "Tetrahymena", and "Euglena". Each organism has its own specific biological cause for a phototactic response, many of which are incidental and serve no end purpose.

Margaret Bennett (writer)

Dr. Margaret Bennett (27 October 1946) is a renowned Scottish writer, folklorist, ethnologist, broadcaster and singer. Her main interests lies in the field of traditional Scottish folk culture and cultural identity of the Scots, home and abroad. The late Hamish Henderson, internationally distinguished poet and folklorist, said about her: "Margaret embodies the spirit of Scotland".
Biography.
Margaret Bennett grew up in a family of tradition bearers: Gaelic, from her mother's side, and Irish and Lowland Scots from her father's. She and her three sisters lived their childhood in the Isle of Skye, "in a household where singing, playing music, dancing and storytelling were a way of life as were traditional crafts." The family moved to the Isle of Lewis in the late 1950s, and then to the Shetland Islands between 1963–1964, when her father (a civil engineer) emigrated to Newfoundland, Canada. When visiting him in 1965, she came across the newly founded Folklore Department at Memorial University of Newfoundland. There, under the direction of Prof. Herbert Halpert, she realised that her cultural heritage "was a subject you could actually study and get a degree in."
After finishing her teacher training in Scotland with distinction, Margaret went back to Newfoundland, where she worked as an elementary school teacher in St. John's between 1967–68. From 1968 she attended the University, intermittently lecturing part-time at St. John's Vocational College, then, in 1975, earned a post-graduate M.A. from M.U.N. She spent a year in Quebec as folklorist for the Museum of Man (now Canadian Museum of Civilization, across the Ottawa River) before returning to Scotland. Between 1977–1984, she worked as a special education teacher in the Scottish Education Department. From 1984 to 1995, she was lecturer in Scottish Ethnology at the School of Scottish Studies of the University of Edinburgh. Since October 1995 she has been Glasgow Honorary Research Fellow of the University of Glasgow (attached to Glasgow-Strathclyde School of Scottish Studies) and lecturer in folklore at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow.
She is the mother of the late Martyn Bennett.

He had a trial at Shrewsbury Town and guested for Walsall and Stoke City during World War I. He played 31 games for the "Potters" in 1917–18 and made 28 appearances at the Victoria Ground in 1918–19. He returned to Molineux, and helped "Wolves" to finish 19th in 1919–20 and 1920–21. Peers joined Port Vale in January 1922 and became the club's first choice goalkeeper with Walter Smith out injured. He was the first Vale player to be capped whilst at the club. He was so confident in his defenders that he spent a lot of his time casually leaning on one of his goalposts. He played 15 Second Division games in the 1921–22 season, and oversaw a club record seven consecutive league games. He made 43 appearances in the 1922–23 campaign, with Daniel Smith deputizing in one match. He retired from league football at The Old Recreation Ground in May 1923 and returned to Hednesford Town.

Red algae

The red algae, or Rhodophyta ( or ; from Ancient Greek: ῥόδον "rhodon", "rose" and φυτόν "phyton", "plant"), are one of the oldest groups of eukaryotic algae, and also one of the largest, with about 5,000–6,000 species of mostly multicellular, marine algae, including many notable seaweeds. Other references indicate as many as 10,000 species; more detailed counts indicate about 4,000 in about 600 genera (3,738 marine species in 546 genera and 10 orders (plus the unclassifiable); 164 freshwater species in 30 genera in eight orders).
The red algae form a distinct group characterized by these attributes: eukaryotic cells without flagella and centrioles, using floridean polysaccharides as food reserves, with phycobiliproteins as accessory pigments (giving them their red color), and with chloroplasts lacking external endoplasmic reticulum and containing unstacked thylakoids. Most red algae are also multicellular, macroscopic, marine, and have sexual reproduction. They often have alternation of generations and may have three generations rather than two.
Many of the coralline algae, which secrete calcium carbonate and play a major role in building coral reefs, belong here. Red algae such as dulse "(Palmaria palmata)" and laver (nori/gim) are a traditional part of European and Asian cuisines and are used to make other products such as agar, carrageenans and other food additives.
Habitat.
Most rhodophytes are marine, although freshwater species are found; these generally prefer clean, running water, but with some exceptions.
Fossil record.
One of the oldest fossils identified as a red alga is also the oldest fossil eukaryote that belongs to a specific modern taxon. "Bangiomorpha pubescens", a multicellular fossil from arctic Canada, strongly resembles the modern red alga "Bangia" despite occurring in rocks dating to 1.2 billion years ago.
Red algae are important builders of limestone reefs. The earliest such coralline algae, the solenopores, are known from the Cambrian period. Other algae of different origins filled a similar role in the late Paleozoic, and in more recent reefs.
Calcite crusts, which have been interpreted as the remains of coralline red algae, date to the terminal Proterozoic. Thallophytes resembling coralline red algae are known from the late Proterozoic Doushantuo formation.
Taxonomy.
In the system of Adl et al. 2005, the red algae are classified in the Archaeplastida, along with the glaucophytes and green algae plus land plants (Viridiplantae or Chloroplastida). The authors use a hierarchical arrangement where the clade names do not signify rank; the class name Rhodophyceae is used for the red algae. No subdivisions are given; the authors say, "Traditional subgroups are artiﬁcial constructs, and no longer valid."
The system reflected the consensus in 2005. Many studies published since then have provided evidence that is in agreement. However, other studies have suggested Archaeplastida is paraphyletic. , the situation appears unresolved.
Below are other published taxonomies of the red algae, although none necessarily has to be used, as the taxonomy of the algae is still in a state of flux (with classification above the level of order having received little scientific attention for most of the 20th century).
A major research initiative to reconstruct the Red Algal Tree of Life (RedToL) using phylogenetic and genomic approaches is funded by the National Science Foundation as part of the Assembling the Tree of Life Program.
Classification comparison.
Some sources (such as Lee) place all red algae into the class "Rhodophyceae". (Lee's organization is not a comprehensive classification, but a selection of orders considered common or important.)
Species of red algae.
Around 6,500 to 10,000 species are known, nearly all of which are marine, with about 200 that live only in fresh water. However, estimates of the number of real species vary by 100%.
Some examples of species and genera of red algae are:
Genomes of red algae.
Only 5 complete genomes of red algae are available, included 4 published in 2013.
There is no genome available almong Compsopogonophyceae, Rhodellophyceae and Stylonematophyceae.
Chemistry.
The δ13C values of red algae reflect their lifestyles. The largest difference results from their photosynthetic metabolic pathway: algae that use HCO3 as a carbon source have far more negative values than those that only use carbon dioxide. An additional difference of about 1.71‰ separates groups intertidal from those below the lowest tide line, which are never exposed to atmospheric carbon. The latter group uses the more 13C-negative dissolved in sea water, whereas those with access to atmospheric carbon reflect the more positive signature of this reserve.
Red algae are red due to phycoerythrin. They contain the sulfated polysaccharide carrageenan in the amorphous sections of their cell walls, although red algae from the genus Porphyra contain porphyran. They also produce a specific type of tannin called phlorotannins, but in lower amount than brown algae do.
Morphology.
Red algae have double cell walls. The outer layers contain the polysaccharides agarose and agaropectin that can be extracted from the cell walls by boiling as agar. The internal walls are mostly cellulose.
Pit connections and pit plugs.
Pit connections.
Pit connections and pit plugs are unique and distinctive features of red algae that form during the process of cytokinesis following mitosis. In red algae, cytokinesis is incomplete. Typically, a small pore is left in the middle of the newly formed partition. The pit connection is formed where the daughter cells remain in contact.
Shortly after the pit connection is formed, cytoplasmic continuity is blocked by the generation of a pit plug, which is deposited in the wall gap that connects the cells.
Connections between cells having a common parent cell are called primary pit connections. Because apical growth is the norm in red algae, most cells have two primary pit connections, one to each adjacent cell.
Connections that exist between cells not sharing a common parent cell are labeled secondary pit connections. These connections are formed when an unequal cell division produced a nucleated daughter cell that then fuses to an adjacent cell. Patterns of secondary pit connections can be seen in the order Ceramiales.
Pit plugs.
After a pit connection is formed, tubular membranes appear. A granular protein, called the plug core, then forms around the membranes. The tubular membranes eventually disappear. While some orders of red algae simply have a plug core, others have an associated membrane at each side of the protein mass, called cap membranes. The pit plug continues to exist between the cells until one of the cells dies. When this happens, the living cell produces a layer of wall material that seals off the plug.
Function.
The pit connections are thought to function as structural reinforcement, and as avenues for cell-to-cell communication and/or symplastic transport in red algae. While the presence of the cap membrane could inhibit this transport between cells, the tubular plug cores may serve as a means of transport.
Reproduction.
The reproductive cycle of red algae may be triggered by factors such as day length.
Fertilization.
Red algae lack motile sperm. Hence, they rely on water currents to transport their gametes to the female organs – although their sperm are capable of "gliding" to a carpogonium's trichogyne.
The trichogyne will continue to grow until it encounters a spermatium; once it has been fertilized, the cell wall at its base progressively thickens, separating it from the rest of the carpogonium at its base.
Upon their collision, the walls of the spermatium and carpogonium dissolve. The male nucleus divides and moves into the carpogonium; one half of the nucleus merges with the carpogonium's nucleus.
The polyamine spermine is produced, which triggers carpospore production.
Spermatangia may have long, delicate appendages, which increase their chances of "hooking up".
Life cycle.
They display alternation of generations; in addition to gametophyte generation, many have two sporophyte generations, the carposporophyte-producing carpospores, which germinate into a tetrasporophyte – this produces spore tetrads, which dissociate and germinate into gametophytes. The gametophyte is typically (but not always) identical to the tetrasporophyte.
Carpospores may also germinate directly into thalloid gametophytes, or the carposporophytes may produce a tetraspore without going through a (free-living) tetrasporophyte phase.
Tetrasporangia may be arranged in a row (zonate), in a cross (cruciate), or in a tetrad.
The carposporophyte may be enclosed within the gametophyte, which may cover it with branches to form a cystocarp.
These case studies may be helpful to understand some of the life histories algae may display:
In a simple case, such as "Rhodochorton investiens":
In the Carposporophyte: a spermatium merges with a trichogyne (a long hair on the female sexual organ), which then divides to form carposporangia – which produce carpospores.
Carpospores germinate into gametophytes, which produce sporophytes. Both of these are very similar; they produce monospores from monosporangia "just below a cross wall in a filament"
and their spores are "liberated through apex of sporangial cell."
The spores of a sporophyte produce either tetrasporophytes. Monospores produced by this phase germinate immediately, with no resting phase, to form an identical copy of parent. Tetrasporophytes may also produce a carpospore, which germinates to form another tetrasporophyte.
The gametophyte may replicate using monospores, but produces sperm in spermatangia, and "eggs"(?) in carpogonium.
A rather different example is "Porphyra gardneri":
In its diploid phase, a carpospore can germinate to form a filamentous "conchocelis stage", which can also self-replicate using monospores. The conchocelis stage eventually produces conchosporangia. The resulting conchospore germinates to form a tiny prothallus with rhizoids, which develops to a cm-scale leafy thallus. This too can reproduce via monospores, which are produced inside the thallus itself. They can also reproduce via spermatia, produced internally, which are released to meet a prospective carpogonium in its conceptacle.
Human consumption.
Several species are important food crops, in particular members of the genus "Porphyra", variously known as "nori" (Japan), "gim" (Korea), or laver (Britain). Dulse ("Palmaria palmata") is another important British species. These rhodophyte foods are high in vitamins and protein and are easily grown; for example, "nori" cultivation in Japan goes back more than three centuries.
In East and Southeast Asia, agar is most commonly produced from "Gelidium amansii".

North Star (train)

The North Star was a passenger train operated by Amtrak along the "Hiawatha Corridor" during the late 1970s and early- to mid-1980s. It originally operated as a Chicago, Illinois–Duluth, Minnesota, train via Saint Paul, Minnesota, but was soon converted to a Saint Paul–Duluth local. The service relied in part on funding from the state of Minnesota.
History.
The "North Star" was introduced in the spring of 1978, when Amtrak moved Twin Cities operations from the Great Northern Depot in Minneapolis to Midway station in Saint Paul and combined the previous Chicago–Minneapolis "Twin Cities Hiawatha" and the Minneapolis–Duluth "Arrowhead" services into one train. Where the "Arrowhead" was a local, the "North Star" was a sleeper originating in Chicago departing there at 10:30 PM in the initial schedule. It took 8 hours 45 minutes to reach Saint Paul, where there was a 35-minute layover. It then took another 3:45 to reach Duluth for an overall schedule of just over 13 hours from Chicago.
Three other trains shared parts of the "North Star" route: the quad-weekly "Empire Builder" (Chicago–Portland, Oregon/Seattle, Washington, via the Milwaukee Road), the thrice-weekly "North Coast Hiawatha" (Chicago–Portland, Oregon/Seattle, Washington, via the Northern Pacific), and the daily "Turboliner" (Chicago–Milwaukee). The "Empire Builder" became a daily train again in 1979 when the "North Coast Hiawatha" was eliminated.
There were perennial budget battles involving the "North Star". In October 1981 cost-cutting measures forced the service to be converted to a Twin Cities–Duluth local, which left the daily "Empire Builder" as the only Chicago–Twin Cities connection. However, no effort was made to link the schedules of the two trains. At this time, the schedule was 3 hours 35 minutes from Saint Paul to Duluth. It briefly stopped service in September 1982 when Amtrak requested $27,000 in funding to keep it operating as a weekend and peak period train. Duluth businessman Jeno Paulucci offered a $25,000 donation, with the rest intended to be covered from some other source. U.S. Senator David Durenberger (R-MN) also requested that Amtrak run a financial audit, which uncovered an extra $100,000 in available funds.
By the end of service in 1985, the "North Star" was no longer planned to serve Superior, Wisconsin, and was only making intermediate stops in Cambridge and Sandstone. State funding for the train was set to run out in March 1985, and the train made its final run on April 7, 1985.

Deep sea creature

The term deep sea creature refers to organisms that live below the photic zone of the ocean. These creatures must survive in extremely harsh conditions, such as hundreds of bars of pressure, small amounts of oxygen, very little food, no sunlight, and constant, extreme cold. Most creatures have to depend on food floating down from above.
These creatures live in very harsh environments, such as the abyssal or hadal zones, which, being thousands of meters below the surface, are almost completely devoid of light. The water is between 3 and 10 degrees Celsius and has low oxygen levels. Due to the depth, the pressure is between 20 and 1,000 bars. Creatures that live hundreds or even thousands of meters deep in the ocean have adapted to the high pressure, lack of light, and other factors.
Barometric pressure.
These animals have evolved to survive the extreme pressure of the sub-photic zones. The pressure increases by about one bar every ten meters. To cope with the pressure, many fish are rather small, usually not exceeding 25 cm in length. Also, scientists have discovered that the deeper these creatures live, the more gelatinous their flesh and more minimal their skeletal structure. These creatures have also eliminated all excess cavities that would collapse under the pressure, such as swim bladders.
Lack of light.
The lack of light requires creatures to have special adaptations to find food, avoid predators, and find mates. Most animals have very large eyes with retinas constructed mainly of rods, which increases sensitivity. Many animals have also developed large feelers to replace peripheral vision. To be able to reproduce, many of these fish have evolved to be hermaphroditic, eliminating the need to find a mate. Many creatures have also developed a very strong sense of smell to detect the chemicals released by mates.
Lack of Resources.
At this depth, there is not enough light for photosynthesis to occur and not enough oxygen to support a fish with a high metabolism. To survive, creatures have much slower metabolisms and therefore can survive using less oxygen. They can also go for months without food. Most food either comes from organic material that falls from above or from eating other creatures that have derived their food through the process of chemosynthesis (the process of changing chemical energy into food energy). Because of the sparse distributions of creatures, there is always at least some oxygen and food. Also, instead of using energy to search for food, these creatures use particular adaptations to ambush prey.
Hypoxic environment.
Creatures that live in the sub-abyss require adaptations to cope with the naturally low oxygen levels.
Deep-sea gigantism.
The term "deep-sea gigantism" describes an effect that living at such depths has on some creatures' sizes, especially relative to the size of relatives that live in different environments. These creatures are generally many times bigger than their counterparts. The giant isopod (related to the common pill bug) exemplifies this. To date, scientists have only been able to explain deep-sea gigantism in the case of the giant tube worm. Scientists believe these creatures are much larger than shallower-water tube worms because they live on hydrothermal vents that expel huge amounts of resources. They believe that, since the creatures don't have to expend energy regulating body temperature and have a smaller need for activity, they can allocate more resources to bodily processes.
There are also cases of deep-sea creatures being abnormally small, such as the lantern shark, which fits in an adult human's palm.
Bioluminescence.
Bioluminescence is the ability of an organism to create light through chemical reactions. Creatures use bioluminescence in many ways: to light their way, attract prey, or seduce a mate. Many underwater animals are bioluminescent—from the viper fish to the flashlight fish, which is named for its light. Some creatures, such as the angler fish, have a concentration of photophores in a small limb that protrudes from their bodies, which they use as a lure to catch curious fish. Bioluminescence can also confuse enemies. The chemical process of bioluminescence requires at least two chemicals: the light producing chemical called luciferin and the reaction causing chemical called luciferase. The luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of the luciferin causing light and resulting in an inactive oxyluciferin. Fresh luciferin must be brought in through the diet or through internal synthesis.
Chemosynthesis.
Since, at such deep levels, there is little to no sunlight, photosynthesis is not a possible means of energy production, leaving some creatures with the quandary of how to produce food for themselves. For the giant tube worm, this answer comes in the form of bacteria. These bacteria are capable of chemosynthesis and live inside the giant tube worm, which lives on hydrothermal vents. These vents spew forth very large amounts of chemicals, which these bacteria can transform into energy. These bacteria can also grow free of a host and create mats of bacteria on the sea floor around hydrothermal vents, where they serve as food for other creatures. Bacteria are a key energy source in the food chain. This source of energy creates large populations in areas around hydrothermal vents, which provides scientists with an easy stop for research. Organisms can also use chemosynthesis to attract prey or to attract a mate.
Deep sea research.
Humans have explored less than 2% of the ocean floor, and dozens of new species of deep sea creatures are discovered with every dive. The submarine DSV Alvin—owned by the US Navy and operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts—exemplifies the type of craft used to explore deep water. This 16 ton submarine can withstand extreme pressure and is easily manoeuvrable despite its weight and size.
The extreme difference in pressure between the sea floor and the surface makes the creature's survival on the surface near impossible; this makes in-depth research difficult because most useful information can only be found while the creatures are alive. Recent developments have allowed scientists to look at these creatures more closely, and for a longer time. A marine biologist, Jeffery Drazen, has explored a solution, a pressurized fish trap. This captures a deep-water creature, and adjusts its internal pressure slowly to surface level as the creature is brought to the surface, in the hope that the creature can adjust.
Another scientific team, from the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, has developed a capture device known as the PERISCOP, which maintains water pressure as it surfaces, thus keeping the samples in a pressurized environment during the ascent. This permits close study on the surface without any pressure disturbances affecting the sample.

Black seadevil

Black seadevils are small, deepsea lophiiform fishes of the family Melanocetidae. The five known species (with only two given common names) are all within the genus Melanocetus. They are found in tropical to temperate waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, with one species known only from the Ross Sea.
One of several anglerfish families, black seadevils are named for their baleful appearance and typically pitch black skin. The family name Melanocetidae may be translated from the Greek "melanos" meaning "black", and "cetus" meaning either "whale" or "sea monster". The humpback anglerfish ("Melanocetus johnsonii") was featured on the August 14, 1995, issue of "Time" magazine, becoming something of a flagship species of deepsea fauna.
Species.
The currently recognized species in this genus are: 
Physical description.
Black seadevils are characterised by a gelatinous, mostly scaleless, globose body, a large head, and generous complement of menacingly large, sharp, glassy, fang-like teeth lining the jaws of a cavernous, oblique mouth. These teeth are depressible and present only in females. Some species have a scattering of epidermal spinules on the body, and the scales (when present) are conical, hollow, and translucent. Like other anglerfishes, black seadevils possess an illicium and esca; the former being a modified dorsal spine—the "fishing rod"—and the latter being the bulbous, bioluminescent "fishing lure". The esca is simple in black seadevils (with either a conical terminus or anterior and posterior ridges in some species), and both it and the illicium are free of denticles. 
The bioluminescence is produced by symbiotic bacteria; these bacteria are thought to enter the esca via an external duct. (In at least two species, the esca is not luminous until this duct develops, suggesting the bacteria originate from the surrounding seawater.) The bacteria, belonging to the family Vibrionaceae, are apparently different in each anglerfish species; the bacteria have yet to be cultured "in vitro".
The eyes of black seadevils are small; the pupil is larger than the lens, leaving an aphakic space. Common among deepsea anglerfish is the strong sexual dimorphism in melanocetids: while females may reach a length of 18 cm (7 in) or more, males remain under 3 cm (1 in). Aside from jaw teeth, males also lack lures. Pelvic fins are absent in both sexes. All fins are rounded with slightly incised membranes; the pectoral fins are small. The single dorsal fin is positioned far back from the head, larger than and above the retrorse anal fin.
Females have large, highly distensible stomachs which give the ventral region a flabby appearance. In life, black seadevils are a dark brown to black. The skin is extremely soft and easily abraded during collection or even by simple handling.
Life history.
The Melanocetidae appear to buck the trend in deepsea anglers, in that the males—despite not feeding and thus being little more than couriers of sperm—are free-living rather than parasitic. A brief attachment to the female does probably occur, however, as evidenced by a case of mistaken identity: A male humpback anglerfish was found attached to the lip of a female horned lantern fish ("Centrophryne spinulosa") of an unrelated (though also nonparasitic) family of anglerfish, Centrophrynidae. Little else is known of their reproduction: They are presumed to not be guarders, releasing buoyant eggs into the water which become part of the zooplankton.
While adults have been trawled from as deep as 3,000 m (9,900 ft), larvae appear to remain in the upper 100 m (330 ft) of the water column and gradually descend with maturity. Males likely outnumber—and mature well before—females by a wide margin. 
The females use their bioluminescent "fishing poles" to lure both conspecifics and prey, which include crustaceans and small fish such as lanternfish and bristlemouths; the seadevils' highly distensible stomachs also allow them to swallow prey larger than themselves, which is an important adaptation to life in the lean depths. In contrast with males, females are poor swimmers and spend most of their time motionless, waiting for something to approach their lures. Predators of black seadevils are not well known, but include lancetfish.

Humpback anglerfish

The humpback anglerfish or common black devil, "Melanocetus johnsonii", is a deepsea anglerfish in the family Melanocetidae, found in tropical to temperate parts of all oceans at depths to . Its length is up to for males and up to for females.
The male.
Male humpback anglerfish are much smaller than the females, being no more than 3 cm (just over an inch) long, whereas the female typically reaches in length. Humpback anglerfish remain free-swimming into adulthood, which is not the case with other deepsea anglerfish: with these, males swim freely when young, but before reaching adulthood, the male fixes itself permanently to the rear of the female's body, living thereafter as a parasite of the female. The male's internal organs now atrophy as the fish shares the female's blood and becomes simply a sperm provider as required.

Jean-Baptiste Blache

Jean-Baptiste Blache de Beaufort (17 May 1765, Berlin - 24 January 1834, Toulouse) was a German ballet dancer and ballet master active in France.
A student of Deshayes, he learned the violon and cello and had what was in essence a provincial career, mainly at Bordeaux, where he succeeded Jean Dauberval. He worked briefly at the Opéra de Paris, putting on "The Barber of Seville" (1806) and "Les Fêtes de Vulcain" (1820) there. Among his best known and most popular ballets are "Les Meuniers" (1787, admired by Arthur Saint-Léon), "L'Amour et la Folie", "La Chaste Suzanne", "La Fille soldat" and "Almaviva et Rosine" (1806).
He retired to Toulouse and declined an offer from that theatre that he become its ballet master. His eldest son, Frédéric-Auguste Blache (1791- ?) revived his father's work at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin from 1816 to 1823, then at the Ambigu-Comique, where he revived the "La Fille soldat". Frédéric-Auguste also wrote "Polichinelle vampire", interpreted by Charles-François Mazurier (1823) and "Jocko ou le Singe du Brésil" (1825). Jean-Baptiste's younger son, Alexis-Scipion (1792-1852), was a ballet master at Lyon, Paris, Marseille, Bordeaux and Saint-Petersburg.

Microbiology

Microbiology (from Greek , "mīkros", "small"; , "bios", "life"; and , "-logia") is the study of microscopic organisms, either unicellular (single cell), multicellular (cell colony), or acellular (lacking cells). Microbiology encompasses numerous sub-disciplines including virology, mycology, parasitology, and bacteriology.
Eukaryotic microorganisms possess membrane-bound cell organelles and include fungi and protists, whereas prokaryotic organisms—which all are microorganisms—are conventionally classified as lacking membrane-bound organelles and include eubacteria and archaebacteria. Microbiologists traditionally relied on culture, staining, and microscopy. However, less than 1% of the microorganisms present in common environments can be cultured in isolation using current means. Microbiologists often rely on extraction or detection of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA sequences.
Viruses have been variably classified as organisms, as they have been considered either as very simple microorganisms or very complex molecules. Prions, never considered microorganisms, have been investigated by virologists, however, as the clinical effects traced to them were originally presumed due to chronic viral infections, and virologists took search—discovering "infectious proteins".
As an application of microbiology, medical microbiology is often introduced with medical principles of immunology as "microbiology and immunology". Otherwise, microbiology, virology, and immunology as basic sciences have greatly exceeded the medical variants, applied sciences.
Branches.
The branches of microbiology can be classified into pure and applied sciences. Microbiology can be also classified based on taxonomy, in the cases of bacteriology, mycology, protozoology, and phycology. There is considerable overlap between the specific branches of microbiology with each other and with other disciplines, and certain aspects of these branches can extend beyond the traditional scope of microbiology.
Benefits.
While some fear microbes due to the association of some microbes with various human illnesses, many microbes are also responsible for numerous beneficial processes such as industrial fermentation (e.g. the production of alcohol, vinegar and dairy products), antibiotic production and as vehicles for cloning in more complex organisms such as plants. Scientists have also exploited their knowledge of microbes to produce biotechnologically important enzymes such as Taq polymerase, reporter genes for use in other genetic systems and novel molecular biology techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid system.
Bacteria can be used for the industrial production of amino acids. "Corynebacterium glutamicum" is one of the most important bacterial species with an annual production of more than two million tons of amino acids, mainly L-glutamate and L-lysine.
A variety of biopolymers, such as polysaccharides, polyesters, and polyamides, are produced by microorganisms. Microorganisms are used for the biotechnological production of biopolymers with tailored properties suitable for high-value medical application such as tissue engineering and drug delivery. Microorganisms are used for the biosynthesis of xanthan, alginate, cellulose, cyanophycin, poly(gamma-glutamic acid), levan, hyaluronic acid, organic acids, oligosaccharides and polysaccharide, and polyhydroxyalkanoates.
Microorganisms are beneficial for microbial biodegradation or bioremediation of domestic, agricultural and industrial wastes and subsurface pollution in soils, sediments and marine environments. The ability of each microorganism to degrade toxic waste depends on the nature of each contaminant. Since sites typically have multiple pollutant types, the most effective approach to microbial biodegradation is to use a mixture of bacterial and fungal species and strains, each specific to the biodegradation of one or more types of contaminants.
Symbiotic microbial communities are known to confer various benefits to their human and animal host's health including aiding digestion, production of beneficial vitamins and amino acids, and suppression of pathogenic microbes. Some benefit may be conferred by consuming fermented foods, probiotics (bacteria potentially beneficial to the digestive system) and/or prebiotics (substances consumed to promote the growth of probiotic microorganisms). The ways the microbiome influences human and animal health, as well as methods to influence the microbiome are active areas of research.
Research has suggested that microorganisms could be useful in the treatment of cancer. Various strains of non-pathogenic clostridia can infiltrate and replicate within solid tumors. Clostridial vectors can be safely administered and their potential to deliver therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated in a variety of preclinical models.
History.
Ancient.
The existence of microorganisms was hypothesized for many centuries before their actual discovery. The existence of unseen microbiological life was postulated by Jainism which is based on Mahavira’s teachings as early as 6th century BCE. Paul Dundas notes that Mahavira asserted existence of unseen microbiological creatures living in earth, water, air and fire. Jain scriptures also describe nigodas which are sub-microscopic creatures living in large clusters and having a very short life and are said to pervade each and every part of the universe, even in tissues of plants and flesh of animals. The Roman Marcus Terentius Varro made references to microbes when he warned against locating a homestead in the vicinity of swamps "because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there by cause serious diseases."
In the medieval Islamic world.
At the golden age of Islamic civilization, some scientists had knowledge about microorganisms, such as Ibn Sina in his book "The Canon of Medicine", Ibn Zuhr (also known as Avenzoar) who discovered scabies germs, and Al-Razi who spoke of parasites in his book "The Virtuous Life" (al-Hawi).
In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or vehicle transmission.
However, early claims about the existence of microorganisms were speculative, and not based on microscopic observation. Actual observation and discovery of microbes had to await the invention of the microscope in the 17th century.
Modern.
In 1676, Anton van Leeuwenhoek, who lived for most of his life in Delft, Holland, observed bacteria and other microorganisms using a single-lens microscope of his own design. While Van Leeuwenhoek is often cited as the first to observe microbes, Robert Hooke made the first recorded microscopic observation, of the fruiting bodies of molds, in 1665. It has, however, been suggested that a Jesuit priest called Athanasius Kircher was the first to observe micro-organisms. He was among the first to design magic lanterns for projection purposes, so he must have been well acquainted with the properties of lenses. One of his books contains a chapter in Latin, which reads in translation – ‘Concerning the wonderful structure of things in nature, investigated by Microscope.’ Here, he wrote ‘who would believe that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms.’ He also noted that putrid material is full of innumerable creeping animalcule. These observations antedate Robert Hooke’s Micrographia by nearly 20 years and were published some 29 years before van Leeuwenhoek saw protozoa and 37 years before he described having seen bacteria.
The field of bacteriology (later a subdiscipline of microbiology) was founded in the 19th century by Ferdinand Cohn, a botanist whose studies on algae and photosynthetic bacteria led him to describe several bacteria including "Bacillus" and "Beggiatoa". Cohn was also the first to formulate a scheme for the taxonomic classification of bacteria and discover spores. Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch were contemporaries of Cohn’s and are often considered to be the father of microbiology and medical microbiology, respectively. Pasteur is most famous for his series of experiments designed to disprove the then widely held theory of spontaneous generation, thereby solidifying microbiology’s identity as a biological science. Pasteur also designed methods for food preservation (pasteurization) and vaccines against several diseases such as anthrax, fowl cholera and rabies. Koch is best known for his contributions to the germ theory of disease, proving that specific diseases were caused by specific pathogenic micro-organisms. He developed a series of criteria that have become known as the Koch's postulates. Koch was one of the first scientists to focus on the isolation of bacteria in pure culture resulting in his description of several novel bacteria including "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", the causative agent of tuberculosis.
While Pasteur and Koch are often considered the founders of microbiology, their work did not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world because of their exclusive focus on micro-organisms having direct medical relevance. It was not until the late 19th century and the work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky, the founders of general microbiology (an older term encompassing aspects of microbial physiology, diversity and ecology), that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed. Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques. While his work on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus established the basic principles of virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation of a wide range of microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by micro-organisms in geochemical processes. He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d'Herelle co-discovered bacteriophages and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.

KARN (AM)

KARN is a commercial sports and talk radio station at 920 AM in Little Rock, Arkansas, owned and operated by Cumulus Media. Originally known as KARK-AM and later locally owned by Ted Snider, the station has long been the flagship station of the Arkansas Radio Network. The station's studios are located in West Little Rock, and the transmitter tower is located in North Little Rock.
KARN AM 920 was formerly a news and talk station, that now airs on 102.9 FM with nationally syndicated programming with a conservative political tone like the Rush Limbaugh show and the Sean Hannity show. Local talk shows are also notably conservative in tone, with afternoon host Dave Elswick the most well known voice. Generations of Arkansas broadcasters have worked at KARN, including sportscaster Jim Elder, talk show hosts Pat Lynch, Ray Lincoln, Bob Harrison, Taylor Carr and Sharon Lee, farm broadcasters Bob Buice, Lowell Ruffcorn, John Philpot, Stewart Doan, Janet Adkison and Keith Merckx (who also spent time as a news reporter and anchor) and newscasters Don Corbett, Vern Beachy, Scott Crowder, Michael Hibblen, Scott Charton, Ron Breeding, Don Griffin, Barry Green, David Wallace, Ken Miller, Paula Cooper, Terry Easley, Jayson Rogers, Grant Merrill, Alan Caudle, Patrick Grant, "Ugly" Ed Johnson and Jack Heinritz. 
As a news and talk station, KARN's Program Directors have included Rick McGee, Dennis Turner, Chuck Martin, Dennis Kelly, Dale Forbis, Bob Shomper, Greg Foster, Neal Gladner, Bud Ford and Dave Elswick.
History.
For a number of years, KARN 920 AM simulcast on two low power FM signals, including KVLO 102.5 FM licensed to Cabot, Arkansas, and KPZK 101.7 FM licensed to Humnoke, Arkansas. While both stations attracted substantial listener numbers, neither signal covered the Little Rock market well. In the summer of 2004, the decision was made to simulcast KARN full-time on the 102.9 FM frequency, which had previously been a country station, but could not compete with heritage station KSSN.
In 2007, upon merger of nearly a couple dozen ABC Radio stations, Citadel Broadcasting relinquished 11 of its radio stations, including KARN-FM, to The Last Bastion Station Trust, LLC. However, the trust decided it would not simulcast KARN-AM, which had remained with Citadel, on KARN-FM; Citadel then transferred KOKY to the trust instead, and re-acquired KARN-FM. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.
Programming.
Notable weekday programming on KARN includes the "Delta Farm Show and Farm Focus" hosted by Gary DiGiuseppe, "First News" with Bob Steel, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Mike Huckabee, Dave Elswick, "Sportsrap" (from ARN), Sean Hannity, and "Coast to Coast AM" on overnights.
The station is an affiliate of the Dallas Cowboys radio network.

Thomas Porteous (merchant)

Thomas Porteous (December 8, 1765 – February 2, 1830) was a merchant, seigneur and politician in Lower Canada. He represented Effingham in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada from 1804 to 1808.
Probably born in Quebec of Scottish descent, although one source states that he was born in Ayrshire, Porteous owned Île Bourdon where he operated a trading post and a ferry service between Lachenaie and the Island of Montreal. In 1786, he married Olivia Everest. Around 1790, he established a business on Île Jésus and then, four years later, at Terrebonne. In 1800, he purchased the seigneury of Terrebonne and, five years later, opened a store at Sainte-Thérèse-de-Blainville, where he also produced potash. Porteous also supplied material to the military during the War of 1812. Around the same time, he established a general store in Montreal. Porteous was an agent for the Saint-Maurice ironworks and helped establish the Lachine Canal, serving as one of the government commissioners. He also petitioned for the incorporation of the Bank of Montreal and served as one its directors. In 1819, he became vice-president of the Montreal Savings Bank. In the same year, with others in his family, he took over the operation of the Montreal Water Works and became its president; the wooden pipes were replaced by iron ones and a steam-powered pumping plant was added. Porteous served as lieutenant-colonel in the militia and was a prominent member of the local Presbyterian Church. He died in Montreal at the age of 64.

<doc id="21393532" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21393532" title="Torque multiplier">
Torque multiplier

A torque multiplier is a tool used to provide a mechanical advantage in applying torque to turn bolts, nuts or other items designed to be actuated by application of torque, such as the actuation of valves, particularly where there are relatively high torque requirements.
Description.
Torque multipliers are often used instead of leveraged extended handles,often referred to as a "cheater bar". Cheater bars use leverage instead of gear reduction to achieve torque, but the torque in its entirety is transmitted through the driving tool and is thought to be dangerous because of sudden catastrophic failure of the drive tool with the extended handle attached. Torque multipliers only have a fraction of the final torque pressure on the drive tool making it the safer choice. Ironically torque multipliers are often referred to as a "CheaterBar" a torque multiplier brand name.
Torque multipliers typically employ an epicyclic gear train having one or more stages. Each stage of
gearing multiplies the torque applied. In the epicyclic gear systems, torque is applied to the input gear or ‘sun’ gear. A number of planet gears are arranged around and engaged with this sun gear, and therefore rotate. The outside casing of the multiplier, is also engaged with the planet gear teeth, but is prevented from rotating by means of a reaction arm, causing the planet gears to orbit around the sun gear. The planet gears are held in a ‘planetary’ carrier which also holds the output drive shaft, therefore as the planet gears orbit around the sun gear, the carrier and so the output shaft rotates. Without the reaction arm to prevent rotation of the outer casing, the output shaft cannot apply torque.
Along with the multiplication of torque, there is a decrease in rotational speed of the output shaft compared to the input shaft. This decrease in speed is inversely proportional to the increase in torque. For example, a torque multiplier with a rating of 3:1 will turn its output shaft with three times the torque, but at one third the speed, of the input shaft. However, due to friction and other inefficiencies in the mechanism, the output torque is slightly lower than the theoretical output.
Applications.
Torque multipliers are most often used when a compressed air powered impact wrench is unavailable. There are many instances where screws, bolts and other fasteners are secured so tightly that using a typical lug wrench with a cheater bar is not sufficient to loosen them. These include automotive repair, product assembly, construction projects, heavy equipment maintenance and other instances where high torque output is needed. A torque multiplier allows the user to generate high torque output without the use of an air compressor or impact gun.
A torque multiplier is generally used when there are space limitations that disallow the use of long handles. They are also used as a safer alternative to a cheater bar as lever length and operator effort are both reduced. Finally, torque multipliers allow for more accurate torque. By removing the amount of effort needed to tighten, a torque multiplier allows for slow and smooth application, ensuring more accurate torque levels.

Agriculture in Paraguay

Throughout its history, agriculture in Paraguay has been the mainstay of the economy. This trend has continued today and in the late 1980s the agricultural sector generally accounted for 48 percent of the nation's employment, 23 percent of GDP, and 98 percent of export earnings. The sector comprised a strong food and cash crop base, a large livestock subsector including cattle ranching and beef production, and a vibrant timber industry.
Growth in agriculture was very rapid from the early 1970s to the early 1980s, a period when cotton and soybean prices soared and cropland under cultivation expanded as a result of agricultural colonization. Growth in agriculture slowed from an average of 7.5 percent annual growth in the 1970s to approximately 3.5 percent in the mid-to-late 1980s. Agricultural output was routinely affected by weather conditions. Flooding in 1982 and 1983 and severe droughts in 1986 hurt not only agriculture, but, because of the key role of the sector, virtually every other sector of the economy as well.
In the aggregate, however, the advances experienced by the sector during the 1970s and 1980s did not reach many of the small farmers, who continued to use traditional farming methods and lived at a subsistence level. Despite the abundance of land, the distribution of the country's farmlands remained highly skewed, favoring large farms. Epitomizing the country's economic activity in general, the agricultural sector was consolidating its quick expansion over the two previous decades and only beginning to tap its potential in the late 1980s.
Land tenure.
The history of land tenure in Paraguay is distinct from that in most Latin American countries. Although there had been a system of land grants to conquistadors, Paraguay was distinguished by Jesuit reducciones that dominated rural life for over a century. After the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 and later the Spanish, the state had become the owner of 60 percent of the country's land by the mid-19th century. Large tracts of land were sold, mostly to Argentines to pay the country's war debt from the Paraguayan War. This was the beginning of the concentration of land in Paraguay not in the hands of the Spanish or of a local elite but rather of foreign investors. Land policy remained controversial until the 1930s, when there was a broader consensus for the titling of land to users of the land and mediating between latifundio and minifundio (small landholding). After 1954, multinational agribusinesses, mostly Brazilian and American, played an increasing role in the economy, often purchasing enormous tracts of land devoted to raising cattle, cotton, soybeans, and timber.
The most striking change in land tenure from 1956 to 1981 was the kind of ownership of the farms. In the 1956 census, 49 percent of all farmers squatted on their land compared with only 30 percent in the 1981 census. This data suggested an increasing interest on the part of small farmers in obtaining title to their land in the face of growing land pressures. The 1981 census also indicated that 58 percent of all farms were owned outright and 15 percent were sharecropper farms; the 1956 census showed that 39 percent of farms belonged to farmers and 12 percent were worked by sharecroppers.
Another striking element of the 1981 agricultural census was the great disparity between small and large landholdings. According to the census, 1 percent of the nation's more than 273,000 farms covered 79 percent of the nation's farmland in use. These large farms had an average landholding of almost 7,300 hectares. Many of the largest holdings were cattle farms in the Chaco Department. By contrast, the smallest farms, which made up 35 percent of all farms, covered only 1 percent of the land, making the average size of a minifundio 1.7 hectares, or less than was necessary for one family's subsistence. Still, the 1981 census figures were somewhat more encouraging than those in the 1956 census, which showed that 1 percent of farms covered 87 percent of the land, and 46 percent of farms covered only 1 percent of the farmland. Another encouraging trend that the census quantified was the declining number of farms under 5 hectares in size and the growth of small to medium-size farms (5 to 99.9 hectares).
Despite these positive trends, the 1981 census pointed to an increasing problem of landlessness. Census figures indicated that roughly 14 percent of all peasants were landless. Landlessness historically had been mitigated by the undeveloped nature of the eastern border region. Because the owners of estates in the region used only a portion of their holdings, peasants could squat on the properties without retribution. Land pressures also were alleviated by the vast tracts of untitled land in the east. Beginning in the 1960s, however, competition for land in the area increased dramatically. Many estate owners sold their lands to agribusinesses; the new proprietors, who were committed to an efficient and extensive use of their holdings, sometimes called upon the government to remove squatters from the lands.
Squatters also came into competition with Paraguayan colonists and Brazilian immigrants. Thousands of colonists were resettled in the eastern region under the government's agrarian reform program. The Brazilian immigration occurred as a result of a dramatic increase in land prices in the 1970s in the neighboring Brazilian state of Paraná. Many farmers sold their properties and crossed into Paraguay, where land was much cheaper. By the late 1980s, at least half of the population in the Canendiyú Department and Alto Paraná Department was Brazilian.
Land reform and policy.
After decades of public controversy over government land policy, two important agrarian laws were enacted in 1963 that guided land policy through the late 1980s. The Agrarian Statute, as the laws were called, limited the maximum size of a single landholding to 10,000 hectares in Eastern Paraguay and 20,000 hectares in the Chaco, with landholdings in excess of this size subject to taxes or possible purchase. This law, however, like many of the laws involved in economic policy, was enforced only loosely or not at all. A more fundamental component of the Agrarian Statute was the creation of the Rural Welfare Institute (Instituto de Bienestar Rural—IBR). The IBR, which superseded the Agrarian Reform Institute, became the central government agency mandated to plan colonization programs, issue land titles to farmers, and provide new colonies with support services such as credit, markets, roads, technical assistance, and other social services as available. From 1963 to the late 1980s, the IBR titled millions of hectares of land and created hundreds of colonies, directly affecting the circumstances of roughly one-quarter of the population. In the late 1980s, the IBR remained the key government agency, along with the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, in serving the land needs of small farmers.
Although the IBR played an important role in stimulating the celebrated "March to the East," the exodus from Paraguay's central zone to the eastern border region that began in the 1960s was a spontaneous process. The task of the IBR was so enormous and its resources so limited that many of the country's farmers bypassed the institute in order to participate in the eastward land grab. Thousands of Paraguayans took it upon themselves to trek eastward to the abundant, fertile, but forested land of Alto Paraná, Itapúa, and other eastern departments. Many of the colonists were pioneers in the truest sense, clearing densely forested areas for farming mostly by axe. Few farmers had access to institutional credit, and these newly colonized areas generally lacked schools, roads, and other amenities.
Land use.
Paraguay comprises a total of 40.6 million hectares of land. But based on soil surveys, analysts have estimated that only one-fifth of that area is appropriate for normal crop production. According to the 1981 agricultural census, 7 percent of the land was dedicated to crop production, 20 percent to forestry, 26 percent to livestock, and 47 percent to other purposes. Theseortant trends in Paraguayan agriculture was the increase in the percentage of land under cultivation, which had been only 2 percent in 1956. Livestock activity fluctuated greatly during the 1970s and 1980s but generally had increased, rising above the 22-percent land use reported in 1956. The improved utilization of agricultural resources resulted from increased colonization, favorable price movements for cash crops, further mechanization, and infrastructural improvements connecting produce with markets.
For agricultural purposes, the country can be divided into three regions: the Chaco, the central region, and the eastern region. The semiarid Chaco contained extensive grazing land that supported 40 percent of the country's livestock. Although the Chaco region covered 60 percent of the country's land mass, it contained only 3 percent of the population and accounted for less than 2 percent of crop production. With the exception of the Mennonite colonies in the central Chaco, there was little crop activity. A more suitable location for crops was the central region in the vicinity of Asunción, where traditional crop production had dominated since peasants were pushed toward the capital at the end of the Paraguayan War. But government policies since the 1960s had favored breaking up minifundios in the central region and establishing larger, more efficient farms in the fertile eastern border region, which is endowed with rich, varied soils, well distributed annual rainfalls, and millions of hectares of hardwood forests. Together these regions cover some 16 million hectares, 40 percent of the country's land and approximately 98 percent of the country's crop land. Agricultural surveys in the east, the new focus of agricultural activity, have determined that 30 percent of the region is suitable for intensive agriculture, 40 percent for livestock, 20 percent for moderate agriculture or livestock use, and 10 percent for forestry.
The country's land use changed rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s as foreign investment, Paraguayan and Brazilian colonists, the construction of Itaipú, favorable commodity prices, and new infrastructure all contributed to the penetration of the dense eastern region. Increased prices for soybeans and cotton beginning in the early 1970s changed the Paraguayan landscape more drastically than any other factor. By the late 1980s, cotton and soybeans accounted for over 1.1 million hectares, or over 40 percent of all land in crops and contributed over 60 percent of exports. Although government policies favored export crops, the rapid expansion of cash crops was largely a direct response that Paraguay's free-market economy made to the rise in the international demand for these products.
Crops.
Soybeans.
Soybeans had replaced cotton as the country's most important crop by the 1980s. A relatively new crop for Paraguay, soybeans were not produced in any quantity until 1967, when they were introduced as the summer rotation crop in a national plan for self-sufficiency in wheat. After soybean prices nearly tripled in 1973, however, much of the land slated for wheat was sown with soybeans instead. As the lucrative nature of soybean cultivation and processing became apparent, several large agribusinesses from Brazil, the United States, and Italy engaged in large-scale, commercial production of soybeans and soybean oil. It is difficult to exaggerate the drastic growth soybeans enjoyed in Paraguay. In 1970 soybeans covered only 54,600 hectares and had an annual production of over 75,000 tons. By 1987 soybeans covered some 718,800 hectares, more than any other crop, with an annual output of 1 million tons and export revenues of approximately US$150 million. The soybean crop grew primarily in the newly colonized departments of Itapúa, Alto Paraná, Canendiyú, and Amambay. Soybeans were produced principally for the world market and sold both as a raw bean and as a processed oil, which was also consumed locally. Soybean prices generally rose beginning in 1970s but experienced significant fluctuations in the early to mid-1980s before recovering in the late 1980s. The major constraint on growth in soybean output, besides price fluctuations, was the lack of storage, drying facilities, and local processing capacity.
Cotton.
Cotton was one of Paraguay's oldest crops, grown since the time of the Jesuit missions. The government encouraged cotton production after the crop was nearly wiped out by the Paraguayan War. Cotton was especially suited to the Paraguayan climate and soils and was grown primarily by small farmers in the central region. Cotton farming also experienced extremely rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970 only 46,900 hectares were sown with cotton, producing a volume of over 37,000 tons. By 1985, however, 385,900 hectares were covered with cotton, yielding almost 159,000 tons. Those figures had dropped to 275,000 hectares and 84,000 tons during the drought of 1986. Foreign-owned, large-scale, commercial production in the eastern border region was surpassing central region production in the late 1980s. Despite the advances in cotton production, cotton cultivation in the 1980s was still characterized by low yields and a low technological level. Even more so than soybeans, cotton suffered wide price fluctuations, and many small farmers who came to rely on cotton revenues in the 1970s became vulnerable to external price fluctuations in the following decade. Some cotton fiber was used domestically, but about 80 percent of the country's crop was processed into cotton lint at more than ten textile-processing factories. Cotton exports in 1987 earned about US$100 million, with most exports going to Uruguay, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan.
Tobacco.
Another key export crop was tobacco. Used domestically for centuries, cigarettes and cigars also earned foreign exchange. During parts of the early 20th century, tobacco was Paraguay's principal agricultural export to Western Europe. Tobacco production slowed in the 1970s with the advent of massive soybean and cotton production. Another reason for the tobacco crop's decline was the inability of the domestic cigarette factories to improve quality control and compete with smuggled brands. Wide price fluctuations of tobacco also explained dwindling production. Despite these difficulties, tobacco made a slight recovery in the 1980s. The area cultivated rose from 7,600 hectares in 1980 to over 8,000 hectares in 1987. Output increased from 11,500 to 12,000 tons. Tobacco was grown throughout Paraguay, mostly by small farmers. Cigarettes and cigars were exported to Argentina, France, and Spain. Tobacco exports were valued at approximately US$9 million in 1987.
Paraguay was also believed to be an expanding producer of marijuana in the 1980s. One United States Congressional report in the 1980s estimated annual production at 3,000 tons.
Coffee.
Coffee was another export crop but of much less importance. Cultivated since the times of the Jesuits, coffee was grown in the central and eastern border regions for local and export markets. Most modern coffee production methods derived from the practices of German colonists in the eastern region. Coffee production boomed in the late 1970s but waned in the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, coffee output rose again, following a pattern of fluctuating production based on price movements. In 1987 approximately 9.2 million hectares of coffee yielded 18.4 million tons of exports with an estimated value of US$44.7 million.
Sugarcane.
Sugarcane remained an important cash crop for small farmers in the late 1980s. Unlike many countries in the Western Hemisphere, Paraguay saw sugarcane as a crop of the future, not because of its use for refined sugar and molasses, but as an input to ethanol, an increasingly popular energy alternative for the country. Sugarcane was planted in Paraguay as early as 1549 with seedlings from Peru, and sugar had been exported since 1556. After the devastation of Paraguay's two major wars, however, local output did not meet domestic demand until the mid-20th century, after which exports were revived. Since then, sugar production has fluctuated with price changes but generally has increased. Paraguay's climate is appropriate for sugarcane cultivation, but traditional methods and inefficient small-scale production limited harvests. Besides low yields, the industry suffered from outdated milling facilities and high production costs. Sugar production, however, was expected to be modernized and increasingly commercialized as a result of its high government priority as an input to an alternative energy source. Some 65,000 hectares of sugarcane produced 3.2 million tons of sugar in 1987, including 7,500 tons of sugar exports valued at US$2.3 million. These figures were highs for the decade.
Oils.
Numerous crops were grown partially or entirely for their value as exported processed oils. Oilseeds represented one of Paraguay's largest agro-industries. One of Latin America's largest oilseed exporters, Paraguay processed cottonseed, soybean, peanut, coconut, palm, castor bean, flaxseed, and sunflower-seed oils. Industrial countries in particular consumed oilseeds as a lower-priced substitute for more traditional oils, which also were higher in cholesterol. Some oil was used locally as well. Paraguay also produced a number of nonvegetable oils, such as tung oil and petitgrain oil. Tung oil, derived from tung nuts, was used as a drying agent in paints. Petit-grain oil, derived from Paraguay's bitter oranges, was used in cosmetics, soaps, perfumes, and flavorings. In the 1980s Paraguay remained one of the world's leading exporters of petit-grain oil.
Food Crops.
Manioc (cassava), maize, beans, and peanuts, the four basic crops of the Guaraní Indians, were still the country's major food crops in the 1980s. Manioc, the staple of the Paraguayan diet, had been cultivated in nearly every area of the country for centuries. Called mandioca in Paraguay, the root crop was the main starch of the diet. Manioc did not experience the rapid explosion of cultivation that cotton, soybean, and maize did. Nevertheless, manioc yields ranked as some of the best in Latin America. In 1986 about 220,000 hectares produced 3.4 million tons of manioc. These figures compared favorably with 1976 data, which recorded 106,500 hectares producing 1.6 million tons.
Maize was Paraguay's most rapidly growing food crop. From the early 1960s to the late 1980s, corn output multiplied rapidly, covering more hectares than any crop except soybeans. After the doubling of both hectares cultivated and total output in the 1970s, corn production accelerated even further in the 1980s, mostly because of continued agricultural colonization. In 1980 approximately 376,600 hectares yielded 584,700 tons of corn, compared with an unprecedented 547,000 hectares of corn in 1987, which harvested 917,00 tons. Like manioc, maize was grown throughout the country, but the departments of Itapúa, Paraguarí, Caaguazú, and Alto Paraná were responsible for most of the harvest. White corn was the traditional corn of Paraguay, but yellow, highyield hybrids were increasingly common, especially on larger farms. Most corn went to domestic human consumption; roughly a third of domestic corn consumption took place in the form of feed grain for the livestock sector. In addition, some surplus corn was exported to Brazil and Argentina, depending on weather conditions and annual output.
Other principal food crops included beans, peanuts, sorghum, sweet potatoes, and rice. Many types of beans were grown in Paraguay, including lima beans, french beans, and peas. Since the 1970s, however, bean production had been declining because of the profitability of other crops. Peanuts, a traditional though marginal crop, expanded in the 1970s and 1980s and often were intercropped with cotton. Peanuts also were processed as an oilseed. Sorghum, a drought-resistant crop, was grown primarily as feed for livestock and was considered a potential crop for the arid Alto Chaco. Sweet potatoes, another main staple crop, like many other food crops, did not expand significantly in the 1970s, and harvests contracted measurably in the 1980s. Rice production, by contrast, expanded after high-yield varieties were introduced in the 1960s. Rice is not a dietary staple in Paraguay as it is in many Latin American countries, but it is popular and consumed in ever-greater quantities. Self-sufficient in rice, Paraguay showed potential as a regional exporter because of its rich soils and irrigation potential along the Río Paraná.
After attempting for twenty years to become self-sufficient in wheat production, Paraguay reached wheat self-sufficiency in 1986. For two decades, the government's national wheat program had encountered numerous obstacles: seeds inappropriate for Paraguay's climate, skyrocketing prices for alternative crops, poor weather, blight infection, and a lack of proper farming practices. From 1976 to 1986, however, the number of hectares covered with wheat multiplied some sixfold, from 24,200 to over 140,000. Wheat output reached 233,000 tons in 1986, 33,000 tons above national consumption. In 1987 approximately 175,000 hectares of wheat fields yielded 270,000 tons, a record high at the time. Over half of all wheat was grown in Itapúa, where most soil testing, tractors, and fertilizers were used. Despite the rapid expansion, wheat production in the 1980s was hurt by floods, droughts, and cheap contraband, all of which caused flour mills to operate at about half of capacity. Smuggled Brazilian flour sometimes was half the price of Paraguayan flour. Future growth in the wheat industry was constrained by a lack of adequate grain-cleaning and storage facilities.
Fruits and vegetables.
Paraguayans cultivated numerous other fruits, vegetables, and spices for both domestic consumption and export. Most common were citrus fruits, which were ideal for Paraguay's subtropical and tropical climate. Paraguay also produced pineapples, which according to some sources originated in Paraguay, and peaches, which were farmed commercially by fruit companies from the United States. Bananas, plums, strawberries, pears, avocados, guavas, papayas, mangoes, grapes, apples, watermelon, and other melons were cultivated to varying degrees as well. Vegetable production included gourds, squash, tomatoes, and carrots. Onions and garlic were widely grown and commonly used in cooking.
A uniquely Paraguayan crop was the yerba maté plant. Yerba maté was grown throughout the country, especially Eastern Paraguay for both domestic and regional markets. Large-scale production was traditionally dominated by Argentine and British interests. Despite its popularity, yerba maté output fell significantly in the 1970s and 1980s, as farmers switched to more lucrative crops.
Livestock.
Raising and marketing livestock, a traditional source of livelihood in Paraguay, remained a major segment of agriculture and the economy at large during the 1980s. Livestock output accounted for roughly 30 percent of agricultural production and about 20 percent of the sector's exports. The raising of livestock represented more than a quarter of total land use and 80 percent of all capital investment in agriculture. Paraguay's vigorous livestock sector also was responsible for the country's high per capita production and consumption of meat and dairy goods. It was estimated that 40 percent of the country's land was especially suited for livestock and some 20 percent generally suitable. Endowed with plentiful grazing lands, Paraguay had vast potential for livestock development.
After the importation of 7 cows and a bull by the Spanish in the mid-1550s, the country's cattle herds swelled to some 3 million head by the time of the Paraguayan War, the largest herds in the Southern Cone. As with every other sector of the Paraguayan economy, the war devastated the country's livestock sector, leaving only 15,000 head. It was not until World War I that domestic demand was met locally and significant exports left the country. By the end of World War II, beef exports had become a major foreignexchange earner. Beef production and exports fluctuated considerably in the postwar period because of international price movements, weather conditions, government pricing policies, and other factors. In 1987 the country's cattle herd stood at about 8 million head with an annual slaughter rate of 1 million head. In that same year, 75 percent of the slaughter went to the domestic market and the remaining 25 percent to the export market.
Cattle, mostly beef cattle, were found throughout the countryside. The Chaco region was best known for its contribution to cattle raising because of its lack of crops and its sprawling ranches. Nevertheless, the cattle population density of Eastern Paraguay, 0.6 head per hectare, was actually higher than that of the Chaco region, 0.3 head per hectare.
The country's breeding stock was primarily Spanish criollo, although over the years considerable crossbreeding with English breeds and zebu cattle from Brazil had taken place. Although cattle were numerous in Paraguay, the country lacked a sufficient number of pure-bred breeding cattle. The livestock sector also suffered from a low calving percentage, a high mortality rate, and a long fattening period for steers. Artificial insemination was increasingly common. To a certain extent, cattle raising reflected the disparities in agriculture in general. There were numerous farmers who owned only a few head of relatively unproductive cattle that were slaughtered for the local market under relatively poor sanitary conditions. By contrast, extremely large cattle ranches typically were owned by expatriates and butchered more productive animals for both national and international markets.
Seventy slaughterhouses for the domestic market and eight for the export market operated in the 1980s. Local slaughterhouses often could not pass sanitary inspections, but government inspection efforts were focused on improving quality control of exports to meet the stringent regulations of foreign beef markets. The country's beef exports expanded until 1974, when Paraguay lost access to European Economic Community (EEC) markets and lower world prices further stagnated output. Beef exports responded strongly but erratically in the 1980s as the government's minimum export price system and contraband activity undercut greater export efforts. For example, beef exports were a mere 3,100 tons in 1985, 48,000 tons in 1986, and 18,000 tons in 1987, the last being the more typical figure. The 1986 boom in beef exports was the direct result of beef shortages in Brazil caused by price controls under its "Cruzado Plan." Paraguay's principal export markets were Brazil, Peru, Chile, the EEC (specialty items only), Colombia, Uruguay, and Saudi Arabia. Missing from official 1987 data, however, was the unregistered sale of an estimated 300,000 head of cattle along the Brazilian border.
Official government policy favored strong cattle development and exports, a view articulated in national livestock programs since the early 1960s. A major policy tool to promote livestock growth was the FG. The FG was not only the major lender to the industry, but it also provided certain veterinary equipment and medicine, encouraged quality control in meat and dairy products, and operated a model farm in the Chaco.
Dairy cattle represented only a small fraction of the total herd. Most milk production occurred at an estimated 400 dairy farms in Asunción, Puerto Presidente Stroessner, Encarnación, and Filadelfia. The best yields came from holstein-friesian dairy cattle followed by crossbreeds and criollo. High feed costs and the general inefficiency of small dairy farmers slowed the growth of the industry. The country produced approximately 180 million liters of milk a year in the late 1980s.
Other livestock activity including poultry farming and the swine industry. Some of the most productive poultry farming took place in the Mennonite colonies, in Japanese colonies in the eastern border region, and in the greater Asunción area. Observers estimated that there were over 14 million chickens, 400,000 ducks, 55,000 turkeys, and several other types of fowl. Egg production stood at 600 million per year in the late 1980s and was growing at about 4 percent a year. Pig farming was a relatively minor activity, engaged in mostly by small farmers. The pork industry's greatest structural problems were the high cost of feed and consumer preferences for beef. Government policy emphasized self-sufficiency in feed grown on small pig farms. Paraguay's swine population amounted to roughly 1.3 million in the late 1980s and had grown at a rate of 6 percent a year in the first half of the decade.
Forestry and fishing.
Forestlands constituted approximately one-third of Paraguay's total area. Utilized for fuelwoods, timber exports, and extracts, the country's wooded areas constituted a key economic resource. Approximately half of all woodlands contained commercially valuable timber. In the 1980s about 4 million hectares were being lumbered commercially. Forestry data was only a broad estimate, however, as a full third of timber production was believed to be exported illegally to Brazil. Registered forestry exports accounted for about 8 percent of total exports during most of the 1980s. Forests have played an important role in the economy since the 19th century with the processing of yerba maté and the resilient quebracho. Because of a general decline in tannin exports, however, the quebracho played a correspondingly less important role in forestry.
Officially, Paraguay produced over 1 million cubic meters of lumber a year in the 1980s. Trees were processed at over 150 small, mostly outdated sawmills that produced wood products for the paper, cardboard, construction, and furniture industries and for export. Trees also fueled the country's railroad and largest steel mill. The country's woodlands contained over forty-five species of wood suitable for export, but fewer than ten species were exported in quantity. Paraguay was recognized as an exporter of fine timber, and its wood exports were internationally competitive. In 1987 lumber exports to Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico earned US$50 million in foreign exchange.
Despite the abundance of premium forests, deforestation was progressing at an alarming rate, about 150,000 to 200,000 hectares per year. The rapid depletion of Paraguay's woods was caused by the clearing of virgin forests associated with agricultural colonization, the farming practice of land-clearing and treeburning, and the felling of trees for charcoal and the other fuelwoods that accounted for 80 percent of household energy consumption.
Although the country contained enormous installed energy capacity, fuelwood remained the most important domestic source of energy in the 1980s. In fact, Paraguay's per capita consumption of fuelwood was the highest in all of Latin America and the Caribbean and nearly three times the level of other South American countries. The deforestation question was complicated by the distribution of forestlands and population. Southeast Paraguay was being deforested the most rapidly. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, that region's forestland decreased from just under 45 percent of all land to 30 percent. The Chaco maintained a large number of forestlands and shrubs, but they could not be economically exploited.
Government policy was slow to respond to deforestation because of the traditional abundance of forests as well as the generally laissez-faire dynamics of the land colonization process. In 1973 the government established a National Forestry Service under the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock to protect, conserve, and expand the country's forests. The service, however, was hindered by a lack of resources, staff, serious government initiatives, and public education on the problem of deforestation. The planting of fast-growing trees and modernization of the lumber industry were recommended by the government, but only about 7,000 hectares of new forests were seeded annually in the mid-1980s. Given these levels of deforestation and reforestation, analysts estimated that few commercial lumbering lands would be available by the year 2020.
For landlocked Paraguay, fishing was only a minor industry. It focused on more than 230 freshwater fish species in the country's rivers and streams. Only fifty or so species of fish were eaten, dorado and pacú being the most popular. Some fishing companies, mostly family operations, maintained boats, refrigeration facilities, and marketing outlets.
Organizations.
The Paraguayan Agricultural Development (PAD) is an agricultural organization based in the country. It is a large scale project, formed by an important group of Paraguayan entrepreneurs and Argentineans in conjunction with the Moises Bertoni Foundation and the Environmental Law and Economics Institute (IDEA).
The organization evaluates economic, social and environmental values for companies in Paraguay, ensuring that they comply with social and environmental regulations for instance, drawing up management plans and granting licenses and offering expertise on the use of agro chemicals and managing the Paraguayan environment in coordination with ideologies of sustainable development.

CHILL-ON

Funded by the European Commission in the 6th Framework Programme for Research (FP 6) ‏ the CHILL-ON project aims to improve quality, safety, transparency and traceability of the chilled/frozen supply chain. To reach the goal, cost-effective technologies, devices and approaches for continuous monitoring and recording of relevant data and processing the data for information management throughout the entire supply chain are under way. As fish and poultry are very prominent in the European food market and belong to the most sensitive goods with regard to food poisoning, the chilled and frozen fish and poultry supply chain has been selected as test cases.
Basic data.
In 2004, the European Commission identified the need for development of new technologies to ensure safety and traceability in the food supply chain. They issued a call for projects under the topic “Integrating and Strengthening the European Research Area”, T5.4.4.1 Chilled and frozen supply chain (IP).
Acronym: CHILL-ON
Title: "Developing and integrating novel technologies to improve safety, transparency and quality assurance of the chilled/frozen food supply chain– test case fish and poultry". 
Duration: 4 years (2006 to 2010) ‏
Total budget: 15,6 Mio. €
EC contribution: 10,1 Mio. €
Funding scheme: 6th Framework programme for research (FP6)‏
Thematic priority: Food quality and safety
Instrument: Integrated Project (IP)
Background.
Food safety is a critical issue in the food supply chain in terms of its maintenance and monitoring – in particular for frozen and chilled food products which are especially sensitive to microbial spoilage. The primary objective of the European food policy is to improve the health and well-being of European citizens through higher quality food and improved control of food production and related environmental factors.
The consumption of chilled/frozen food products within Europe is growing above average as a consequence of socio-cultural changes (e.g. increased single households), whereas food safety and quality are of great concern for consumers. 
Improved confidence in chilled food products, especially in the integrity of their supply-chain in terms of its ability to maintain product quality and identity along with its ability to detect potentially harmful and undesirable product changes is of high priority for all involved in food production and distribution, especially as requires traceability to be established at all stages of the food chain.
Improvements by CHILL-ON.
CHILL-ON aims to improve the quality, safety and transparency of the food supply chain. Through a proactive and integrated approach, CHILL-ON will implement in-depth research for each step of the chilled/frozen supply chain. 
The outputs of this project are integrated in a holistic approach to deliver a complete solution, to significantly enhance the state of the art of the entire food supply chain from - "farm to fork". The project will result in a novel concept for tracking and tracing - "TRACECHILL" to include input from novel biosensors for low temperature micro organisms, novel chilling and packaging technologies and smart labelling.
The focus of the CHILL-ON project is to provide for the first time ever an integrated solution for the entire frozen and chilled food supply chain. This will be done by implementing an interdisciplinary research and development work programme which includes a very wide spectrum of disciplines: from biochemistry; genetics and microbiology, through chilling, packaging, smart labels (eChillOn) and logistics up to information technologies such as active and passive RFID, GPS, GIS, electronic Supply Chain Management (eSCM) and a Decision Support System (DSS). This is integrated into the novel traceability solution proposed by CHILL-ON for the frozen/chilled food supply chain called TRACECHILL.

Initial value theorem

In mathematical analysis, the initial value theorem is a theorem used to relate frequency domain expressions to the time domain behavior as time approaches zero.
It is also known under the abbreviation IVT.
Let
be the (one-sided) Laplace transform of "ƒ"("t"). The initial value theorem then says
Proof.
Based on the definition of Laplace transform of derivative we have:
thus:
But formula_5 is indeterminate between t=0- to t=0+; to avoid this, the integration can be performed in two intervals:
In the first expression where 0-<t<0+, e-st=1. In the second expression, the order of integration and limit-taking can be changed. Also formula_7 where 0+<t<∞ is zero. Therefore:
By substitution of this result in the main equation we get:

Madame Anatole

Constance-Hippolyte Gosselin (2 January 1793, Paris - date of death unknown) was a French ballet dancer. The daughter of a dancing master and younger sister of the dancer Geneviève Gosselin, Constance débuted at the Opéra de Paris in 1810, after studying dance under Louis Duport and Jean-François Coulon. She married Auguste-Anatole Petit in 1815 and was thus also known as Madame Anatole.
Made première danseuse in 1822, her principal partner was Paul, with whom she made a triumphal tour to London in 1822. Her dance style was elegant and discrete, predisposing her to serious roles in ballets by Pierre Gardel, Jean-Pierre Aumer and Albert. She left the stage in 1830.

2008–09 anti-Israel riots in Norway

The 2008–2009 Anti-Israel riots in Norway were a series of violent anti-Israel and anti-Jewish protests by Muslims that took place outside the Israeli embassy and the Storting in Oslo during late December 2008 and January 2009 amidst the Gaza War between Israel and Palestinian militant groups. On several occasions there were clashes between rioters and police as the protesters attacked civilians and destroyed private and public property. More than 160 people were detained, a majority of foreign descent. A Norwegian non-Jewish pro-Israel protester was attacked and injured by anti-Israel protesters shouting "take him, he's a Jew", "fucking Jew" and "allahu akbar". Among other slogans, protesters shouted "Death to the Jews," "Kill the Jews" and "Slaughter the Jews" in Arabic.
Timeline.
A peaceful demonstration outside the Israeli embassy in December 2008 became violent when Muslim Arab youths began throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks at the embassy and the police. The police arrested four youths of Arab descent aged 16–25.
On 4 January 2009, hundreds demonstrated against Israel outside the Storting and then moved to the Israeli embassy in Parkveien. Members of the crowd grew violent, and again the police were called in. The demonstrations was dispersed by firing tear gas.
On 8 January there was a legal pro-Israel demonstration outside the Storting. A force of 200 policemen were stationed in the area of Spikersuppa. Before the demonstration the police said that they were worried about trouble and riots. Because a prominent politician, Siv Jensen, was scheduled to give a speech a pro-Israel speech, The Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) stated that measures had been taken to insure Jensen's safety.
In the middle of Jensen's speech, pro-Palestinian activists started throwing rocks at pro-Israeli demonstrators. Jensen was forced to leave the podium. The police used tear gas when the rioters attacked a bus that tried to evacuate pro-Israeli activists from the area, including a large number of elderly demonstrators.
A Norwegian pro-Israel protester was attacked and injured by anti-Israel protesters while shouting "take him, he's a Jew", "fucking Jew" and "allahu akbar".
Among other slogans, protesters shouted "Death to the Jews," "Kill the Jews" and "Slaughter the Jews" in Arabic.
According to politicians in the Storting, people tried to seek refuge inside the building, but they had to lock the doors because of the tear gas. At least four McDonald's restaurants were destroyed in the riots because of a rumor spread by text message that all the money McDonald's earned that day would go to support Israel. This was later confirmed to be a hoax.
Arrests.
The police arrested a total of 160 people during the riots, a majority of foreign descent, and 11 of whom were formally charged with violent behavior and damage to private and public property. The rest of the arrested pleaded not guilty to any charges. The police stated that they would investigate all the arrested and most of them would receive a fine of 9000 NOK (around 1300 USD).

Hechal Yehuda Synagogue

The Hechal Yehuda Synagogue (, "Beit haKnesset Hechal Yehuda"), also commonly known as the Recanati synagogue (, "Beit haKnesset Recanati"), is one of approximately 500 synagogues in the second largest city of Israel, Tel Aviv. Situated on the Menahem ben Saruq street in the city's centre, it is often referred to as the "Seashell Synagogue" (, "Beit haKnesset Konkit", ) because of its unusual shape resembling a seashell. The design is inspired by the seashells on the shores of the Greek city of Thessaloniki, which is the hometown of the wealthy Recanati family. It was the Recanati family who donated the money for the synagogue. It is affiliated with Orthodox Judaism.
History.
The Hechal Yehuda Synagogue was built in memory of the Jewish community of Thessaloniki that was almost completely destroyed during the Holocaust. It is named after Yehuda Leon Recanati, an important benefactor, acting around the world. The construction of the synagogue was completed in 1980. Today most worshippers at the synagogue are Greek-Sephardi Jews originating from Thessaloniki.
Architecture.
The north bare concrete facade is decorated with bas-reliefs of traditional Jewish motifs and symbols, made by artist Yechezkel Kimchi, while the coloured-glass windows, that present motifs from Jewish holidays, were made by the local artist Josef Shealtiel. The shell-like design creates an internal space which enables the congregation to see and to hear from wherever they are seated. The synagogue, incorporating two floors, has room for 600 persons, 400 men and 200 women in separated galleries.

Anatole (dancer)

Auguste-Anatole Petit, known as Monsieur Anatole, was a French ballet dancer, master and composer.
Life.
Premier danseur at the Opéra de Paris from at least 1814, in 1815 he married the dancer Constance-Hippolyte Gosselin. Travelling to Brussels in 1818, Anatole and Eugène Hus revived "Nina ou la Folle par amour" (a ballet by Louis Milon first put on in Paris in 1813) at the Théâtre de la Monnaie.
Anatole remained premier danseur at the Opéra de Paris until 1822, then (after a nearly 10 year blank in the historical record) he is evidenced as a ballet master at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, replacing Jean Coralli when the latter was summoned to Vienna by imperial decree. Anatole only held this role for half a season before being reappearing in 1836 as a ballet master at the town theatre in Bruges, before ending his career as a professor at the dance school at the Opéra de Paris.
Works.
He wrote only one ballet, "Le Sicilien ou l'Amour peintre" ("The Sicilian, or Love the Painter"). This was put on at the Opéra on 11 June 1827, with music originally written by Fernando Sor and completed by Jean Schneitzhoeffer. The main rôles in the production were held by Albert, Ferdinand and Lise Noblet, and another cast member was Madame Montessu. The work had its first success a month into the run, when Marie Taglioni and her brother Paul appeared in it, making their débuts.

Eugène Hus

Pierre-Louis Stapleton (17 July 1758, Brussels – 24 February 1823, Brussels) was a Franco-Belgian ballet dancer and choreographer. He was also known from around 1759 by the pseudonym Eugène Hus, after his stepfather Jean-Baptiste Hus.
Life.
He was the son of Louis Stapleton, an Irish officer in the garrison at Brussels, and Elisabeth Bayard, a ballet dancer at the Théâtre de la Monnaie known by the pseudonym Mlle Bibi. Deserted by his father when he went off on campaign, Pierre-Louis soon got on the stage alongside his mother – aged around 4 he danced before prince Charles-Alexandre de Lorraine, who offered him 50 ducats in a gold box in recognition of his precocious talents, according to Hus's obituary in the "Journal de Brussels". In 1762, Jean-Baptiste Hus arrived in Brussels as ballet master returning to the Théâtre de la Monnaie. Pierre-Louis was adopted by Hus (Elisabeth was Hus's mistress and later wife) and followed the couple on their wanderings, performing at Lyon (1764–67 and 1770–79), where Pierre-Louis began his career as a ballet master under Hus's guidance.
With Pierre Gardel and Auguste Vestris, Eugène Hus was one of the main founders of 19th century ballet and a witness to major political and artistic changes. He was the only living link between Noverre and Russian ballet, via the Petipa family.

1990 is the eleventh album by American singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston. It was released in January 1990, through record label Shimmy Disc.
Background.
It was originally intended that all tracks would be first studio recordings. However, Johnston's ongoing problems with mental illness prevented him completing an album's worth of sessions. As a result, the album is compiled from studio recordings, home recordings and live performances. Johnston alludes to this in the film "The Angel and Daniel Johnston – Live at the Union Chapel" when he mentions that the album had originally intended to be called "1989", but they had not been able to release it that year.

Pholcus phalangioides

The cellar spider ("Pholcus phalangioides"), also known as the skull spider due to its cephalothorax looking like a human skull, is a spider of the family Pholcidae. Females have a body length of about 9 mm; males are slightly smaller. Its legs are about 5 or 6 times the length of its body (reaching up to 7 cm of leg span in females). Its habit of living on the ceilings of rooms, caves, garages or cellars gives rise to one of its common names. They are considered beneficial in some parts of the world because they kill and eat other spiders, including species that are venomous to humans such as hobo and redback spiders.
Originally a species restricted to warmer parts of the west Palearctic, through the help of humans this synanthrope now occurs throughout a large part of the world. It is unable to survive in cold weather, and consequently it is restricted to (heated) houses in some parts of its range.
This is the only spider species described by the Swiss entomologist Johann Kaspar Füssli who first recorded it for science in 1775. Confusion often arises over its common name, because "daddy longlegs" is also applied to two other unrelated arthropods: the harvestman and the crane fly.
"Pholcus phalangioides" has the habit of shaking its web violently when disturbed as a defence mechanism against predators. It can easily catch and eat other spiders (even those much larger than itself, such as "Tegenaria duellica"), mosquitoes and other insects, and woodlice. When food is scarce, it will prey on its own kind. Rough handling will cause some of its legs to become detached.
Because they originally came from the subtropics, these spiders do not appear to be influenced by seasonal changes and breed at any time of the year. The female holds the 20 to 30 eggs in her pedipalps. Spiderlings are transparent with short legs and change their skin about 5 or 6 times as they mature.
Venom.
An urban legend states that Pholcidae are the most venomous spiders in the world, but this claim has been proven untrue. Recent research has shown that pholcid venom has a relatively weak effect on insects. In the "MythBusters" episode "Daddy Long-Legs" it was shown that the spider's fangs (0.25 mm) could penetrate human skin (0.1 mm) but that only a very mild burning feeling was felt for a few seconds.

Emil Dürr

Emil Dürr (11 June 1920 – 27 June 1944) was an "Unterscharführer" in the "Waffen SS" during World War II who was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, (which was to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership by Nazi Germany during World War II).
Emil Dürr was born on 1 June 1920, in Mühlacker. During World War II he volunteered to join the "Waffen SS" and was posted to the 12th SS Panzer Division "Hitlerjugend" which was formed in 1943.
Located in France during the Normandy Invasion, the Division was moved to the front near Caen, Dürr was by now an "Unterscharführer" and Assault gun commander in the 4th (Heavy) Company, 26th SS "Panzergrenadier" Regiment.
He was awarded the Iron Cross Second class on 23 June and the Iron Cross First class the next day on 24 June.
Knight's Cross.
The Knight's Cross was for the action on 26 June 1944.
For almost three hours Dürr and the 26th Panzergrenadiers had been subjected to a naval bombardment; salvo after salvo landing in the line of main defense outside the village of Saint Manvieu and on the village itself. The Germans had been awaiting a major offensive on the Carpiquet airfield and the Orne river.
When the gunfire stopped, the SS men observed Sherman tanks which were advancing onto their location. The armoured vehicles broke through the positions and overran St. Manvieu, surrounding the Battalion command post in the park. They engaged the tank force with mortar fire and some of the tanks turned away, assuming that the forces in the park were much stronger and did not attempt to break through. A flamethrower tank had set up at the entrance to the park, dominating the command post, and able to harass any movement. "That tank has to go", the commander ordered.
"Unterscharführer" Dürr had heard the order, he picked up a "Panzerfaust" (a one-shot anti-tank weapon) and went out to scout the situation. It was difficult to get close to the tank as it was sitting in a position that covered the terrain on three sides. Dürr jumped across the inner wall of the yard, ran straight at the tank and discharged the "Panzerfaust" - which did not pierce the tanks' armour. Dürr was wounded in the chest, but he ran back along the path he had come, picked up another "Panzerfaust" and ran towards the tank a second time. As the distance was unfavorable, he aimed at the tracks. But again, Dürr was hit by machine gun fire. Crawling, he worked his way back and spotted a magnetic charge. For a third time, weak from his wounds, he jumped across the wall and ran towards the tank. Paying no attention to the bullets, he attached the charge to the tank and turned away when he heard a rumbling sound behind him as the charge dropped to the ground; with no regard for his own safety, he picked the charge up and held it against the tank. When it exploded he fell to the ground paralyzed and also wounded in the legs.
He was taken to rest in the command post but died four hours later.
Emil Dürr was awarded a posthumous Knight's Cross in August 1944, and entered on the Honour Roll the following month.

Audio and video interfaces and connectors

The existence of many different audio and video standards necessitates the definition of hardware interfaces, which define the physical characteristics of the connections between electrical equipment. This includes the types and numbers of wires required along with the strength and frequency of the signal. It also includes the physical design of the plugs and sockets.
An interface may define a connector that is used only by that interface (e.g., DVI) or may define a connector that is also used by another interface; for example, RCA connectors are defined both by the composite video and component video interfaces.
Audio connectors and video connectors are electrical connectors (or optical connectors) for carrying audio signal and video signal, of either analog or digital format. Analog A/V connectors often use shielded cables to inhibit radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise.
Since both analog and digital signals are used with some styles of connectors, knowledge of the interface used is necessary for a successful transfer of signals. Some interface types use only a distinctive connector or family of connectors, to ensure compatibility. Especially with analog interfaces, physically interchangeable connectors may not carry compatible signals.
Some of these connectors, and other types of connectors, are also used at radio frequency (RF) to connect a radio or television receiver to an antenna or to a cable system; RF connector applications are not further described here.
Interfaces.
PC System Design Guide Audio.
Older sound cards had no common standard color codes until after PC99. The PC System Design Guide (also known as the PC 97, PC 98, PC 99, or PC 2001 specification) is a series of hardware design requirements and recommendations for IBM PC compatible personal computers, compiled by Microsoft and Intel Corporation during 1997–2001. PC 99 introduced a color code for the various standard types of plugs and connectors used on PCs.
The color code for audio plugs follow:
† Though the input is often mono, the actual connector is usually still a 3-conductor TRS phone minijack. Many mono computer microphones have 3-conductor TRS plugs.
S/PDIF.
The electrical coaxial cable (with RCA jacks) or optical fibre (TOSLINK).
Note that there are no differences in the signals transmitted over optical or coaxial S/PDIF connectors—both carry exactly the same information. Selection of one over the other rests mainly on the availability of appropriate connectors on the chosen equipment and the preference and convenience of the user. Connections longer than 6 meters or so, or those requiring tight bends, should use coaxial cable, since the high light signal attenuation of TOSLINK cables limits its effective range.
HDMI.
High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video standard for transmitting uncompressed digital data.
There are three HDMI connector types. Type A and Type B were defined by the HDMI 1.0 specification. Type C was defined by the HDMI 1.3 specification.
Type A is electrically compatible with single link DVI-D. Type B is electrically compatible with dual link DVI-D but has not yet been used in any products.
IEEE 1394 "FireWire".
IEEE 1394 FireWire is a digital data transfer protocol commonly used for digital cameras (common on MiniDV tape camcorders), but also used for computer data and audio data transfers. In the United States, cable TV converter set top boxes by law also have the connection for transferring content directly to a TV (if equipped with a port) or computer for viewing. 1394 can also use coaxial cable as a medium for longer runs.
Unlike Point-to-Point connections listed above, IEEE 1394 is able to host several signals on the same wire, with the data delivered and shown on the destination set. It is also fully bi-directional, with its full bandwidth used in one direction or the other, or split directions up to its maximum.
DisplayPort.
DisplayPort is a digital display interface standard (approved May 2006, current version 1.1a approved on January 11, 2008). It defines a new license-free, royalty-free, digital audio/video interconnect, intended to be used primarily between a computer and its display monitor, or a computer and a home-theater system.
The video signal is not compatible with DVI or HDMI, but a DisplayPort connector can pass these signals through. DisplayPort is a competitor to the HDMI connector, the de facto digital connection for high-definition consumer electronics devices.
Combined audio/video interfaces.
Some connectors can carry both audio and video signals simultaneously:
Other composite connectors that carry video, audio, power, and USB:
Audio connectors.
Audio connectors are used for audio frequencies. They can be analog or digital.
Single wire connectors used frequently for analog audio include:
A myriad of multi-conductor cable plug connectors and matching sockets are used for analog and digital audio connections.
Phone connector.
A phone connector (tip, ring, sleeve) also called an audio jack, phone plug, jack plug, stereo plug, mini-jack, or mini-stereo. This includes the original 6.35mm (quarter inch) jack and the more recent 3.5mm (miniature or 1/8 inch) and 2.5mm (subminiature) jacks, both mono and stereo versions.
DIN.
A DIN connector is a connector that was originally standardized by the Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN).
BNC.
The BNC (Bayonet Neill Concelman) connector is a very common type of RF connector used for terminating coaxial cable.
TOSLINK.
TOSLINK or Optical Cable is a standardized optical fiber connection system.
XLR.
XLR connector plugs and sockets are used mostly in professional audio and video electronics cabling applications. XLR connector are also known as "Cannon plugs" after their original manufacturer. They are used for analog or digital balanced audio with a balanced line
Digital audio interfaces and interconnects with the AES/EBU interface also normally use an XLR connector.
RCA.
RCA connectors, also known as "phono" connectors or "phono plugs", are used for analog or digital audio or analog video. These were first used inside pre-World-War-II radio-phonographs to connect the turntable pickup to the radio chassis. They were not intended to be disconnected and reconnected frequently, and their retaining friction was quite sufficient for their original purpose. Furthermore, the design of both cable and chassis connectors was for minimum cost. Initially intended for audio frequency connections only, the RCA plug was also used for analog composite video and non-critical radio-frequency applications.
Video connectors.
Video connectors carry only video signals. Common video-only connectors include:
Mini-DIN.
The Mini-DIN connectors are a family of multi-pin electrical connectors used in a variety of applications. Mini-DIN is similar to the larger, older DIN connector. Both are standards of the Deutsches Institut für Normung, the German standards body.
D-subminiature.
D-subminiature or D-sub is a common type of electrical connector used particularly in computers. Calling them "subminiature" was appropriate when they were first introduced, but today they are among the largest common connectors used in computers. The DB25 is used for multi-track recording and other multi-channel audio, analog or digital (ADAT interface (DB25)).
Video In Video Out.
Video In Video Out, usually seen as the acronym VIVO (commonly pronounced vee-voh), is a graphics card port which enables some video cards to have bidirectional (input and output) video transfer through a Mini-DIN, usually of the 9-pin variety, and a specialised splitter cable (which can sometimes also transfer sound).
VIVO is found predominantly on high-end ATI video cards, although a few high-end NVIDIA video cards also have this port. VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports Composite, S-Video, and Component as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs. Many other video cards only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement Video Graphics Array or DVI, typically using a component breakout cable and an S-Video cable.
DVI Connector.
The Digital Visual Interface (DVI) is a video interface standard designed to maximize the visual quality of digital display devices such as flat panel LCD computer displays and digital projectors. It is designed for carrying uncompressed digital video data to a display.
There are four basic connectors:
The connector also includes provision for a second data link for high resolution displays, though many devices do not implement this. In those that do, the connector is sometimes referred to as DVI-DL (dual link).
So we need to know two things about the connector: 
Color codes.
Newer connectors are identified by their shape and not their colour.

After dancing in Lyon and Bordeaux, Paul débuted at the Opéra de Paris in 1820 and quickly became one of the public's favourite premiers danseurs. Nicknamed "l'Aérien" due to his technical qualities, August Bournonville stated "Paul's superiority is his lightness, elasticity, speed, softness and precision. He knows how to combine daring and natural grace." He regularly performed in London, with partners including his sister Madame Montessu and Madame Anatole, as well as at Naples, where he was praised by Stendhal. He retired from the stage in 1831.

In 1993, Johnston, gaining popularity, was offered a contract under Elektra Records; although a beneficial agreement for Johnston, he refused, since Metallica, a band Johnston believed to be possessed by Satan, was under the label. Johnston, now under the impression that his manager was also possessed by Satan, fired him and continued to look elsewhere for a music label. Johnston signed under Atlantic Records, and released "Fun" in 1994 while housed in a mental institution. The album was a commercial failure, and in 1996, two years after the release, Johnston was dropped from the Atlantic Records label.

Racetrack principle

In calculus, 
the racetrack principle describes the movement and growth of two functions in terms of their derivatives.
This principle is derived from the fact that if a horse named Frank Fleetfeet always runs faster than a horse named Greg Gooseleg, then if Frank and Greg start a race from the same place and the same time, then Frank will win. More briefly, the horse that starts fast and stays fast wins. 
In symbols: 
or, substituting ≥ for > produces the theorem
which can be proved in a similar way
Proof.
This principle can be proven by considering the function h(x) = f(x) - g(x). If we were to take the derivative we would notice that for x>0
Also notice that h(0) = 0. Combining these observations, we can use the mean value theorem on the interval x and get
Since x > 0 for the mean value theorem to work then we may conclude that f(x) - g(x) > 0. This implies f(x) > g(x).
Generalizations.
The statement of the racetrack principle can slightly generalized as follows; 
as above, substituting ≥ for > produces the theorem 
Proof.
This generalization can be proved from the racetrack principle as follows:
Given formula_1 for all formula_14 where a≥0, and formula_15, 
Consider functions formula_26 and formula_27
formula_28 for all formula_2, and formula_30, which by the proof of the racetrack principle above means formula_31 for all formula_2 so formula_4 for all formula_14.
Application.
The racetrack principle can be used to prove a lemma necessary to show that the exponential function grows faster than any power function. The lemma required is that
for all real x. This is obvious for x<0 but the racetrack principle is required for x>0. To see how it is used we consider the functions
and
Notice that f(0) = g(0) and that
because the exponential function is always increasing (monotonic) so formula_1. Thus by the racetrack principle f(x)>g(x). Thus,
for all x>0.

Bale Out

"Bale Out: RevoLucian's Christian Bale Remix!" is a satirical dance remix by American composer Lucian Piane, also known as RevoLucian, released on February 2, 2009, to YouTube and Myspace. The piece utilizes audio from a July 2008 rant made by actor Christian Bale on the set of "Terminator Salvation". Various other elements are used in the remix, including pulsating dance track beats and clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of then-President George W. Bush, creating the impression of Streisand arguing with Bale.
The day after its release, the YouTube page for the song had been viewed over 200,000 times, and over a million times by February 5, 2009. The Associated Press called it a "hypnotic dance track", and United Press International noted it was "catchy", characterizing it as a "YouTube sensation". Gil Kaufman of MTV.com described the piece as "a techno-ripping, demonic dance party". "Time" magazine's website called the track "hilarious", and "Nine News" characterized it as a "raging online success". The director of "Terminator Salvation" McG liked the remix and put a copy of it on his iPod, and Bale said he had heard the remix and thought "they did a good job".
Background.
In July 2008, Christian Bale was filming a scene in New Mexico for the film "Terminator Salvation" with actress Bryce Dallas Howard. The film's director of photography, Shane Hurlbut, walked into Bale's line of sight, and the actor proceeded to yell obscenities at Hurlbut. Bale said he would quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the error and was not subsequently fired. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.
The website TMZ.com reported the occurrence soon after it happened, and posted an audio recording on February 2, 2009. The event did not become widely publicized until after TMZ.com had posted the audio of Bale's outburst. TMZ.com reported that film executives for "Terminator Salvation" sent a copy of the audio recording to the film's insurance company, in case Bale refused to continue filming.
Four days after the audio recording was posted to the Internet, Bale appeared as a guest on Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, where he was asked about the altercation. He said he "acted like a punk", and that he and Hurlbut talked after the conflict and "resolved this completely". Bale acknowledged the two worked together for several hours after the episode, and "at least a month after that", and noted, "I've seen a rough cut of the movie and he has done a wonderful job. It looks fantastic."
Composition.
Prior to the release of Bale Out, Lucian Piane was known for a variety of satirical remixes, including tracks featuring Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, political commentator Bill O'Reilly during an on-camera outburst in the 1980s, and Andrew Meyer, who received national media attention when he was tasered by police during a speech given by U.S. Senator John Kerry at the University of Florida.
The Associated Press reported that Piane was "drawn to the musicality of Bale's rage-filled voice". Piane spent three hours working on the remix. "When I heard Christian Bale flip out I had to remix the track. ... It's good to hear that clubs have already started playing it as it is very funny," said Piane. In an interview with "LA Weekly", Piane commented that he wants his remix remembered, instead of Bale's outburst: "We're all people in this world. So I figured, of remembering that one time Christian Bale went crazy on set, maybe people will remember the remix."
The "Bale Out" mashup incorporates audio clips of Bale lashing out, and Hurlbut responding "I was looking at the lights." The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying "it's fucking distracting", and "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush, making it sound as though Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but I hope he does. I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned it into something that all these people are enjoying."
Release.
Piane uploaded the piece to MySpace and YouTube on February 2, 2009, hours after the original clip of Bale appeared on the internet. Piane made an MP3 file of "Bale Out" available as a free download from his MySpace page. "Bale Out" had been viewed over 200,000 times one day after it was uploaded to YouTube, and within two days it had received 700,000 hits. Three days after its posting, "Bale Out" had been viewed over one million times on YouTube, and over 1.5 million times after one week.
In a report on the remix for "The Situation Room" on CNN, correspondent Brooke Anderson noted "... by the looks of this musical parody already posted on YouTube, this infamous rant will be talked about – for a long time to come." Anderson Cooper of "Anderson Cooper 360°" described the RevoLucian remix as "the ballistic Bale boogie". A piece in "Vue Weekly" posed the question "what does it all mean in the end when a remixed diatribe by a Hollywood star will get way more hits in a day than any film-criticism site in a year?"
Reception.
"LA Weekly" reported that McG, the director of "Terminator Salvation", had a copy of "Bale Out" on his iPod. "And I have to admit, that dance remix YouTube is pretty hot," said McG in an interview with "Fast Company". In an interview with "E!: Entertainment Television" to discuss "Terminator: Salvation", Christian Bale said he had heard the remix and commented: "It was a good remix; they did a good job." Bale said he had received a remix of his outburst from a friend: "They did a bloody good job! I've gotta say, what a great impulse, you know? To take something ugly like that and make it into a dance? That's a wonderful thing."
The Associated Press described the piece as a "hypnotic dance track", "beat-driven", and a "pulsating tune". The AP noted "Bale has become an unwitting music sensation because of the incident." A "Los Angeles Times" blog described "Bale Out" as "a genius piece of mixing by L.A.'s very own RevoLucian", and called the piece a "brilliant" club remix. MTV.com called it "a techno-ripping, demonic dance party in which Bale's berating is repeated ad nauseam under pictures of the actor and random f-bomb interjections from Barbra Streisand". United Press International characterized the remix as a "YouTube sensation", calling it "catchy".
"LA Weekly" described the remix as "a mash-up of Bale's best quotes set to a synth-heavy beat", and noted "'Bale Out' turned 'What don't you fuckin' understand?' into one of the year's most addictive choruses and spun a little art out of the debacle." The "Irish Independent" called the piece a "painstakingly constructed dance track", and described the chorus as "oddly catchy". "The Globe and Mail" commented that the remix has "an imperilling beat, a genius comedic flair and more sheer scariness than "American Psycho" and "Terminator" combined". "The Wall Street Journal" wrote that Piane combined Bale's language with "a driving house music track".
"TIME" magazine's website described the piece as "a hilarious YouTube musical remix". "Nine News" called RevoLucian's piece a "cheeky remix" and a "raging online success". "The Daily Telegraph" in London highlighted the RevoLucian piece among the "Best of the mash-ups and spoofs" of the Bale outburst, noting he arranged the audio clips from Bale into a "potential dancefloor success". "Dose" magazine commented "We've been throwing light-switch raves to the RevoLucian mix all week," and "BlackBook Magazine" described it as "a brilliant club mix of Bale's meltdown that's bound to scream in your head all day". "The A.V. Club" called the piece "a Hater-worthy techno remix", and "The Celebrity Cafe" commented "Revolucian's remix must have had techno artists everywhere sweating to come up with something half as good, and likely inspired a few outlandish requests by club goers."
North Carolina State University doctoral student Matt Morain commented on the remixes spawned by Bale's rant, in an April 2009 paper on Internet memes. Morain noted that remixes of Bale's rant received more hits than the rant itself, "What is more surprising than the nearly two million views is that a number of remixes appeared, in response to the clip, which have substantially higher view-counts than the original. In this process of remixing we can clearly see the elements of fantasy theme and rhetorical transmission." Perez Hilton commented, "Once again, Lucian Piane has outdone himself! You "must" listen to this." Hilton posted a video to his blog of himself dancing to Piane's remix.
On November 17, 2009, Piane's remix received a nomination for "Best Remix of the Year" by the website "Urlesque". The website's staff noted the Piane remix "spread like wildfire", and became an Internet phenomenon. Piane's remix was one of five nominations; it lost to the "Slap Chop Rap" parodying Vince Offer. "Bale Out" was a finalist in the category of "Latest Favorite Viral Video", in the "2009 Best of Clicker Awards"; the winner was "David After Dentist".

Coaches of the Great Western Railway

The passenger coaches of the Great Western Railway (GWR) were many and varied, ranging from four and six-wheeled vehicles for the original broad gauge line of 1838, through to bogie coaches up to long which were in service through to 1947. Vacuum brakes, bogies and through-corridors all came into use during the nineteenth century, and in 1900 the first electrically lit coaches were put into service. The 1920s saw some vehicles fitted with automatic couplings and steel bodies.
Early vehicles were built by a number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build carriages at Swindon railway works, which eventually provided most of the railway’s stock. Special vehicles included sleeping cars, restaurant cars and slip coaches. Passengers were also carried in railmotors, autotrains, and diesel railcars. Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk and at express speeds.
Most coaches were painted in a chocolate brown and cream livery, although this did change over the years, however they were plain brown or red until 1864 and from 1908 to 1922. Parcels vans and similar vehicles were seldom painted in the two-colour livery, being plain brown or red instead, which caused them to be known as "brown vehicles".
History.
Pre 1900s.
Early GWR carriages, in common with other railways at the time, were typically wooden vehicles based on stagecoach practice and built on short, rigid six-wheel (or sometimes four-wheel) underframes, although the broad gauge allowed wider bodies with more people seated in each compartment. Three classes were provided, although third class carriages were not conveyed in every train and, for the first few years, were little more than open trucks with rudimentary seats. Some rigid eight-wheeled carriages were produced but vacuum brakes and bogies made an appearance before the end of the broad gauge in 1892.
The first train in the United Kingdom with corridor connections between all carriages entered service on 7 March 1890 on the Paddington to Birkenhead route, and further corridor trains were introduced on all the main routes over the next few years. In 1900 a new Milford Boat Train set introduced electric lights and the communication cord was moved inside the train; until now a passenger needing to stop the train in an emergency had to lean out of the window and pull a cord above the door. At this time carriages generally had a clerestory roof but elliptical roofs were fitted to the GWR steam rail motors in 1903.
1903-1930.
The GWR always had an in-built loading gauge advantage over the other British railways, in that its entire infrastructure was originally designed for broad gauge dimensions. By switching to , the GWR had extra space in which it could design and deploy larger-scale rolling stock.
The first carriage stock to take advantage of both advantages were the 1904 Dreadnought stock, with:
The "Dreadnought" was also the first GWR carriage with internal compartment doors, but as these did not go dow well with the travelling public, the next design reverted to external compartment doors. The Concertina design of 1906/7 reverted to width but retained the length. The doors were recessed into the body side rather than flush with the outer panels, and as each carriage was placed in a fixed-set, the company had fitted bellows-like material connections between carriages to smooth the airflow.
The GWR most successful and iconic design was the Toplight stock of 1907, which gained its name through the small "lights" or windows above the main windows. The "Toplight" reverted to a standard loading gauge pattern with lengths of up to but always wide. Coaches panelled in steel rather than wood first appeared in 1912.
The next significant change came in 1922 when bow-ended stock was introduced in both 57 ft and 70 ft lengths. Hitherto coaches had featured flat ends but bow ends were easier to fit with Buckeye couplings that were then finding favour with passenger trains in the United Kingdom. These coaches were generally more plain than earlier vehicles as they had flush sides without beaded panels.
Unlike other railways which were highly dependent on commuters, the GWR had not introduced any high-capacity articulated sets until 1925, which due to their lack of flexibility in use were seen by Swindon as a failure. From 1929 coaches had windows flush with the body panels, the first such sets being for the Cornish Riviera Express but general service coaches followed the following year, including the infamous "B Sets", two-coach trains mainly used on branch lines.
1930s.
With costs rising and reveues falling, General Manager Sir Felix Pole had told Chief Mechanical Engineer Charles Collett to develop more powerful economic designs, which lead to his adaption of his predecessor George Jackson Churchward's design, as opposed to the taking on board of new steam technology such as Sir William Stanier did at the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. Collett followed the same philosophy in his carriage design, improving or adpating as opposed to innovating.
In 1929 the GWR board approved the lease from Pullman Company of new Pullman Carriages for the "Ocean" special boat trains serving the passenger liners berthing at Plymouth. However, in 1929 the GWR Board approved Collett's proposed development of a larger and more accommodating carriage, as had been tried with the earlier "Dreadnoughts". In 1931 the first of the eight "Super Saloons" were built, also known as "Ocean Saloons".
In 1935 excursion stock with open saloons instead of compartments was introduced, followed by the 26 "Super-Saloon"-scale Centenary stock for the Cornish Riviera Express. From 1936 onwards, all new GWR main line stock had large windows to each compartment and entry-exit via the corridor and end vestibules, but it had taken Collett six years to do what the LMS and LNER had been doing since 1930.
A distinctive new profile appeared in 1944, when new CME Frederick Hawksworth introduced corridor coaches with domed roof-ends, although non-corridor coaches and auto trailers retained a more conventional roof. Fluorescent lights were tried in new coaches built in 1946.
Special carriages.
A few sleeping cars were operated on the broad gauge and such carriages became familiar on overnight trains. Restaurant cars became practical following the introduction of corridor trains; the first cars in 1896 were for first class passengers only but a second class buffet car appeared on the Milford Boat Train in 1900. Slip coaches were operated on many routes that could be uncoupled from the rear of a moving train and serve intermediate stations that the train did not call at. During World War II some "Special Saloons" were built for the use of VIPs and for the Royal Train.
Livery.
The livery of early carriages was a dark chocolate brown but from 1864 the upper panels were painted white which became a pale cream after being varnished and exposed to the weather. These panels were later painted in cream to give a similar effect. From 1908 carriages were painted chocolate brown all over but this changed to a red lake colour in 1912. A two-colour livery reappeared in 1922, now with a richer shade of cream on the upper panels and chocolate brown below. Certain vehicles such as parcels vans and horse boxes, which were allowed to run in passenger trains, were often painted in just chocolate brown when the passenger carrying coaches were in chocolate and cream, and so this non-passenger carrying coaching stock came to be known as "brown vehicles".
Numbering.
Each class of carriage was initially numbered in its own series, starting at 1. This entailed renumbering any vehicles that were reclassified, for instance first class carriages downgraded to second class. To bring them all into one series in 1907 third class carriages were left with their original numbers; second class had 5000 added to their numbers; composites had 6000 added; first class had 8000 added; sleepers and saloons were renumbered in the 9000-9399 series; and catering cars were renumbered in the 9500 series.
Diagram codes.
Diagram codes were introduced by George Jackson Churchward for easy reference to different carriage types. Each type could then be identified with a diagram that combined a letter (which represented a general type) and a number (which represented a distinctive design of that type ), for instance C3 or H16.
Telegraphic codes.
The GWR pioneered telegraphic communication in 1839, and a number of code words came to be used to represent various carriage types. The codes changed over the years as needs changed. Many of the codes could have an extra letter to identify variations, such as Scorpion C ( a carriage truck), or Scorpion D (a carriage truck). In 1939 the following codes were in use:

Its current capacity inmates is 1,250. Kilby serves as receiving and processing center for all male Alabama state inmates. The current Kilby Correctional Facility warden is John Cummins. The Montgomery Women's Facility, an ADOC facility for women, is located behind Kilby.
History.
In 1922 and 1923, the State of Alabama constructed and opened Kilby Prison, located on four miles (6 km) north of the State Capitol. Named in honor of Thomas Erby Kilby, (1865–43) Governor of Alabama, (1919–23). "Yellow Mama", the electric chair was located at Kilby Prison. Deterioration after forty-five years led to the prison closing in 1969. The prisoners were moved to the new Holman Correctional Facility.
The new Kilby was established as the Mt. Meigs Medical and Diagnostic Center in December 1969 and had an original capacity of 440 inmates. Kilby was designed with an on-site hospital, dormitories, and one hundred two-man cells in order to facilitate its role as receiving center for all male prisoners held by the state of Alabama.

François-Ferdinand Decombe (15 April 1789, Bordeaux - 18 July 1865, Fontainebleau) was a French ballet dancer and ballet master, under the stage name Albert.
Albert débuted aged 14 at the Théâtre de la Gaîté, before being taken on by the Opéra de Paris in 1808, havin been recommended to them by Jean-François Coulon and Auguste Vestris. Ejected by the ballet master Pierre Gardel, Albert divided his time between Paris and London, where he showed all the measure of his talent. Ousted from the Opéra in 1831, to the benefit of Jean Coralli and Filippo Taglioni, he worked in London, Naples and Marseille. From 1838 to 1840 Albert was ballet master to the Brussels Théâtre de la Monnaie, where he made the talents of Arthur Saint-Léon known to the public. On his return to Paris in 1841 he composed the divertissements for the opera "La Favorite" by Donizetti and for other pieces by that composer. He was also the author of a dance manual, "L'art de la danse à la ville et à la cour" (Paris, 1834).

Pandercetes gracilis

The Lichen Huntsman Spider, "Pandercetes gracilis"(also called the lichen spider), is a spider found in Queensland, Australia, as well as New Guinea, Maluku Islands, and Sulawesi.
Description.
The Lichen huntsman can very in color amongst individuals, all of which are of the color of different species of lichen, but according to the Queensland Museum Inquiry Centre:
"Spider colour is fixed at its previous moult. A slight exception being the abdomen with its much thinner walls which may change especially according to accumulated waste products or what it has eaten. So they can't change colour like a frog, gecko or squid. Some species of spiders that camouflage on tree bark have multiple colour forms however."
"So far as is known, a lichen spider would not be selecting a background according to colour as these are like most (but not all) spiders in having poor vision. It is expected that they would have other ways of detecting a nice lichen-covered background to sit against however."
Diet and hunting.
The spider is known to hunt by ambush and then pounce when its prey comes within range. Its exceptional agility and speed, as well as its ability to squeeze into tight corners and camouflage, gives it a strong advantage both in capturing prey and evading predators.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJPLMC3Voxo&feature=related]

Marie Petipa

Marie Mariusovna Petipa (; 17 (29) October 1857, St. Petersburg – 16 January 1930, Paris) was a noted Russian ballerina. She was the daughter of Marius Petipa (under whom she studied) and Maria Petipa. Her debut was at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1875 in "Le Dahlia bleu" and her dancing career, mainly in the character dance repertoire, lasted until 1907, although she performed on rare occasions through 1911.
At the height of her career, Petipa was one of the most known ballerinas in St. Petersburg. Her portraits were drawn by the well-known artists (a portrait of her by Konstantin Makovsky has survived), her private life was discussed in the newspapers, and her 25th career anniversary in 1901 was widely celebrated in St. Petersburg. Vlas Doroshevich wrote a lengthy article on this occasion titled "Goddess of Joy and Merriment" (). Petipa went on many tours abroad and was awarded Ordre des Palmes Académiques in France.
She was in a civil marriage with the dancer Sergei Legat (1875-1905), who was much younger than her. Petipa left theater two years after her husband committed suicide.
At the time of the October Revolution of 1917, Petipa was sixty years old. The revolution took everything away from her: she lost both her house and her pension and was left with nothing, not even money for food. She pleaded to the Soviet government for assistance but received no help. The only help came from the fellow actors, who, however, were unable to sustain her permanently. Her second plea to the government for a pension was rejected as well. In 1928, she moved to Paris where she lived in poor conditions. Petipa died in 1930 and was buried near Paris. The money paid for the funeral was only enough for five years, after which she was reburied in a common grave.
According to the Soviet sources, Petipa lead Legat to commit suicide and then married a businessman in 1910, getting ten million francs as a result. Nevertheless, the Directorate of the Academic Theaters petitioned to grant Petipa a pension in 1924. According to the same sources, Petipa emigrated to Paris in 1926 where she had two strokes and died of impulsive insanity.

Frederick Homes Dudden (1874–1955) was an academic administrator and theological scholar. He was Chaplain to King George V and George VI (1929–52), Master of Pembroke College, Oxford (1918–55) and Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University (1929–32).
Frederick Dudden was educated at Bath College and Pembroke College, Oxford. Dudden was Vicar of Holy Trinity Church in Sloane Street, central London. He was Fellow, Lecturer in theology and Chaplain of Lincoln College, Oxford (1898–1914). He was Canon of Gloucester (1918–37). At Oxford University, he was a member of Hebdomadal Council (1924–45) and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (1925–29 and 1932–49), before and after his time as Vice-Chancellor.
At Pembroke College, he was the first Master to live in the Lodgings. The previous Master's House was converted into undergraduate accommodation in 1928. He was a friend of Lord Nuffield, which led to the endowment of the Pembroke Mastership. This freed subsequent Masters of Pembroke from the financial need to take the position of Canon at Gloucester Cathedral, which had been given to the College by Queen Anne in 1714.

Life skills

Life skills are behaviors used appropriately and responsibly in the management of personal affairs. They are a set of human skills acquired via teaching or direct experience that are used to handle problems and questions commonly encountered in daily human life. The subject varies greatly depending on social norms and community expectations.
Enumeration and categorization.
UNICEF states "there is no definitive list" of life skills but enumerates many "psychosocial and interpersonal skills generally considered important." It asserts life skills are a synthesis: "many skills are used simultaneously in practice. For example, decision-making often involves critical over thinking ("what are my options?") and values clarification ("what is important to me?"), (How do I FEEL about this?"). Ultimately, the interplay between the skills is what produces powerful behavioural outcomes, especially where this approach is supported by other strategies
Life skills can vary from financial literacy, substance abuse prevention, to therapeutic techniques to deal with disabilities, such as autism. 
Life skills curricula designed for K-12 often emphasizes communications and practical skills needed for successful independent living for developmental disabilities/special education students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP).
Parenting.
Life skills are often taught in the domain of parenting, either indirectly through the observation and experience of the child, or directly with the purpose of teaching a specific skill. Yet skills for dealing with pregnancy and parenting can be considered and taught as a set of life skills of themselves. Teaching these parenting life skills can also coincide with additional life skills development of the child.
Many life skills programs are offered when traditional family structures and healthy relationships have broken down, whether due to parental lapses, divorce or due to issues with the children (such as substance abuse or other risky behavior). For example, the International Labor Organization is teaching life skills to ex-child laborers and risk children in Indonesia to help them avoid the worst forms of child labor.
Youth: behavior prevention vs. positive development.
While certain life skills programs focus on teaching the prevention of certain behaviors the Search Institute has found those programs can be relatively ineffective. Based upon their research The Family and Youth Services Bureau, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services advocates the theory of Positive Youth Development as a replacement for the less effective prevention programs. Positive Youth Development, or PYD as it's come to be known as, focuses on the strengths of an individual as opposed to the older methods which tend to focus on the "potential" weaknesses that have yet to be shown. The Family and Youth Services Bureau has found that individuals who developed life skills in a positive, rather than preventive, manner feel a greater sense of competence, usefulness, power, and belonging.

Agriculture in Jordan

Agriculture in Jordan contributed substantially to the economy at the time of Jordan's independence, but it subsequently suffered a decades-long steady decline. In the early 1950s, agriculture constituted almost 40 percent of GNP; on the eve of the June 1967 War, it was 17 percent.
By the mid-1980s, agriculture's share of GNP in Jordan was only about 6 percent. In contrast, in Syria and Egypt agriculture constituted more than 20 percent of GNP in the 1980s. Several factors contributed to this downward trend. With the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Jordan lost prime farmland. Starting in the mid-1970s, Jordanian labor emigration also hastened the decline of agriculture. Many Jordanian peasants abandoned farming to take more lucrative jobs abroad, sometimes as soldiers in the armies of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states or in service industries in those countries. Others migrated to cities where labor shortages had led to higher wages for manual workers. Deserted farms were built over as urban areas expanded. As the Jordanian government drove up interest rates to attract remittance income, farm credit tightened, which made it difficult for farmers to buy seed and fertilizer.
In striking contrast to Egypt and Iraq, where redistribution of land irrigated by the Nile and Euphrates rivers was a pivotal political, social, and economic issue, land tenure was never an important concern in Jordan. More than 150,000 foreign laborers—mainly Egyptians—worked in Jordan in 1988, most on farms. Moreover, since the early 1960s, the government has continuously created irrigated farmland from what was previously arid desert, further reducing competition for arable land. Ownership of rain-fed land was not subject to special restrictions. Limited land reform occurred in the early 1960s when, as the government irrigated the Jordan River valley, it bought plots larger than twenty hectares (50 acres), subdivided them, and resold them to former tenants in three-hectare to five-hectare plots. Because the land had not been very valuable before the government irrigated it, this process was accomplished with little controversy. In general, the government has aimed to keep land in larger plots to encourage efficiency and mechanized farming. The government made permanently indivisible the irrigated land that it granted or sold so as to nullify traditional Islamic inheritance laws that tended to fragment land.
Agricultural Development.
Although the agricultural sector's share of GNP declined in comparison with other sectors of the economy, farming remained economically important and production grew in absolute terms. Between 1975 and 1985, total production of cereals and beans rose by almost 150 percent, and production of vegetables rose by more than 200 percent, almost all of the increase occurring between 1975 and 1980. Production of certain cash export crops, such as olives, tobacco, and fruit, more than quadrupled. Because farming had remained labor-intensive, by one estimate about 20 percent to 30 percent of the male work force continued to depend on farming for its livelihood.
Even with increased production, the failure of agriculture to keep pace with the growth of the rest of the economy, however, resulted in an insufficient domestic food supply. Jordan thus needed to import such staples as cereals, grains, and meat. Wheat imports averaged about 350,000 tons (12.9 million bushels) per year, ten to twenty times the amount produced domestically. Red meat imports cost more than JD30 million per year, and onion and potato imports cost between JD3 million and JD4 million per year. Between 1982 and 1985, the total food import bill averaged about JD180 million per year, accounting for more than 15 percent of total imports during the period. At the same time, cash crop exports—for example, the export of 7,000 metric tons of food to Western Europe in 1988—generated about JD40 million per year, yielding a net food deficit of JD140 million. One emerging problem in the late 1980s was the erosion of Jordan's traditional agricultural export market. The wealthy oilexporting states of the Arabian Peninsula, concerned about their "food security," were starting to replace imports from Jordan with food produced domestically at costs far higher than world market prices, using expensive desalinated water.
Cropping and production.
Observers expected food imports to remain necessary into the indefinite future. Much of Jordan's soil was not arable even if water were available; by several estimates, between 6 percent and 7 percent of Jordan's territory was arable, a figure that was being revised slowly upward as dry-land farming techniques became more sophisticated. In 1989 the scarcity of water, the lack of irrigation, and economic problems, rather than the lack of arable land set a ceiling on agricultural potential. Only about 20 percent of Jordan's geographic area received more than 200 millimeters of rainfall per year, the minimum required for rain-fed agriculture. Much of this land was otherwise unsuitable for agriculture. Moreover, rainfall varied greatly from year to year, so crops were prone to be ruined by periodic drought.
In 1986 only about 5.5 percent (about 500,000 hectares), of the East Bank's 9.2 million hectares (230 million acres) were under cultivation. Fewer than 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres) were irrigated, almost all in the Jordan River valley. Because arable, rain-fed land was exploited extensively, future growth of agricultural production depended on increased irrigation. Estimates of the additional area that could be irrigated were Jordan to maximize its water resources ranged between .
Most agricultural activity was concentrated in two areas. In rain-fed northern and central areas of higher elevation, wheat, barley, and other field crops such as tobacco, lentils, barley, and chick peas were cultivated; olives also were produced in these regions. Because of periodic drought and limited area, the rain-fed uplands did not support sufficient output of cereal crops to meet domestic demand.
In the more fertile Jordan River valley, fruits and vegetables including cucumbers, tomatoes, eggplants, melons, bananas, and citrus crops often were produced in surplus amounts. The Jordan River Valley received little rain, and the main source of irrigation water was the East Ghor Canal, which was built in 1963 with United States aid.
Although the country's ultimate agricultural potential was small, economic factors apparently limited production more than environmental constraints, as reflected by up to 100,000 hectares of potentially arable land that lay fallow in the late 1980s. The government has expressed considerable concern about its "food security" and its high food import bill, and it was implementing plans to increase crop production in the 1990s. Growth in agricultural output was only about 4 percent during the 1980-85 Five-Year Plan, despite investment of approximately JD80 million during the period, indicating the slow pace of progress.
In the late 1980s, Jordan was implementing a two-pronged agricultural development policy. The long-term strategy was to increase the total area under cultivation by better harnessing water resources to increase irrigation of arid desert areas for the cultivation of cereal crops, the country's most pressing need. In the short term, the government was attempting to maximize the efficiency of agricultural production in the Jordan River valley through rationalization or use of resources to produce those items in which the country had a relative advantage.
Rationalization started with a controversial 1985 government decision to regulate cropping and production, primarily in the Jordan River valley. Farmers there had repeatedly produced surpluses of tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, and squashes because they were reliable and traditional crops. At the same time, underproduction of crops such as potatoes, onions, broccoli, celery, garlic, and spices led to unnecessary imports. The government offered incentives to farmers to experiment with new crops and cut subsidy payments to those who continued to produce surplus crops. In 1986 cucumber production dropped by 25 percent to about 50,000 metric tons and tomato harvests dropped by more than 33 percent to 160,000 metric tons, while self-sufficiency was achieved in potatoes and onions.
Production of wheat and other cereals fluctuated greatly from year to year, but never came close to meeting demand. In 1986, a drought year, Jordan produced about 22,000 tons (810,000 bu) of wheat, down from 63,000 tons (2,300,000 bu) in 1985. In 1987 Jordan harvested about 130,000 tons (4,800,000 bu), a record amount. Because even a bumper crop did not meet domestic demand, expansion of dry-land cereal farming in the southeast of the country was a major agricultural development goal of the 1990s. One plan called for the irrigation of a 7,500-hectare area east of Khawr Ramm (known as Wadi Rum) using 100 million cubic meters per year (80,000 ac·ft/yr) of water pumped from a large underground aquifer. Another plan envisioned a cultivated area in the Wadi al Arabah region south of the Jordan River valley using desalinated water from the Red Sea for irrigation.
Livestock.
Livestockimited in the late 1980s. Jordan had about 35,000 head of cattle but more than 1 million sheep and 500,000 goats, and the government planned to increase their numbers. In the late 1980s, annual production of red meat ranged between 10,000 and 15,000 metric tons, less than 33 percent of domestic consumption. A major impediment to increased livestock production was the high cost of imported feed. Jordan imported cereals at high cost for human consumption, but imported animal feed was a much lower priority. Likewise, the arid, rain-fed land that could have been used for grazing or for fodder production was set aside for wheat production. Jordan was self-sufficient, however, in poultry meat production (about 35,000 metric tons) and egg production (about 400,000 eggs), and exported these products to neighboring countries.

Belisarius Begging for Alms

Belisarius Begging for Alms () is a large-format (288 × 312 cm) history painting in oil on canvas by Jacques-Louis David. It depicts the Byzantine general Belisarius, who heroically defeated the Vandals in North Africa in AD 533–534 on behalf of Justinian I, and (according to an apocryphal account probably added to his biography in the Middle Ages) was later blinded by the emperor and reduced to begging for alms on the street. David exhibited the work at the Salon of 1781 after returning from Italy and it proved a great success.
It is now on show at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille.
Themes.
The theme of mercy is omnipresent in the work, focusing on the three people considered most "base": the woman, the child and the old man who embodies the image of Mercy. The hands of these three individuals horizontally convey the idea of weakness involving need and love. The soldier, meanwhile, in the background, lifts his hands vertically to show his astonishment, with his chest forward. The three human ages represented give an idea of the glory of youth and the wreck of old age. 
Style.
The same subject had already been used by Peyron in his own "Belisarius receiving Hospitality from a Peasant"; in contrast, only a few characters are present here and the scene is dependent on the story for dramatic effect. David shows us a fallen hero, old and blind, begging in the street with a young child when one of his former soldiers, astonished, recognises him. 
The setting is Antique: sober, austere and overwhelming architecture is placed behind the depiction of harsh conditions. This shows that the artist wanted to associate Greek style with heroic themes in the context of the concerns of the artist's time. Essentially, it is through the theme of virtues borrowed from ancient times that the "true style," later called neo-classical, spread into art, rejecting the frivolities of the royal court of Louis XVI at the time of the French revolution. In the very composition of the work of David, however, the essence of the tableau juxtaposes several rococo ideas, and is thus not a completely neo-classical work. Nonetheless, the neo-classical perspective can still be found, especially in the ideas behind this painting: a revolutionary (David) offers a meditation on the moral heroism in adversity.

Æthelwig

Æthelwig (d. 16 February in either 1077 or 1078) was an Abbot of Evesham before and during the Norman Conquest of England. Born sometime around 1010 or 1015, he was elected abbot in 1058. Known for his legal expertise, he administered estates for Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester prior to his election as abbot. After his election, he appears to have acted as Ealdred's deputy, and was considered as a possible successor when Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York. Æthelwig worked during his abbacy to recover estates that had been lost to Evesham, as well as acquiring more estates.
After the Norman Conquest, in 1066, Æthelwig was one of the few Englishmen trusted by the new King William the Conqueror, and was given authority over parts of western England. As part of his duties, he was a royal judge and held important prisoners. During the Harrying of the North in 1069–1070, Æthelwig gave aid to refugees from the north of England. He also helped the king in the rebellion of 1075, preventing one of the rebels from joining the others. Æthelwig died on 16 February in either 1077 or 1078, and was memorialised in a work on his life that was later incorporated in the "Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham", a 13th-century history of the abbey and its abbots.
Early life and election as abbot.
Æthelwig was probably born about 1010 to 1015, and inherited a large amount of land from his family. He served as an administrator of the estates of Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester, as well as those of Evesham Abbey. Æthelwig was also known as a legal expert. He was elected abbot in 1058, and was blessed on 23 April 1058, by Ealdred, who was the diocesan bishop for Evesham. He replaced the previous abbot, Mannig, who had become paralysed. One story has it that Ealdred asked King Edward the Confessor to give the abbacy to Æthelwig, another, in the "Chronicon de Abbatiae Evesham", a history of Evesham Abbey, states that it was Mannig who asked the king to make the appointment. The "Chronicon" also states that the blessing took place at Gloucester, and that Ealdred was Archbishop at the time, although Ealdred did not become Archbishop of York until 1060.
During Æthelwig's abbacy, he appears to have acted as the deputy for Ealdred, as bishop of Worcester. In 1062, he was one of the candidates to succeed Ealdred as bishop, when Ealdred was promoted to Archbishop of York, but Wulfstan was chosen instead. Æthelwig also served as a judge for King Edward the Confessor, at one point hearing a case at the royal court along with Wulfstan and Regenbald, the chancellor. The abbot also led military forces in battle, and served King Edward as an advisor.
Æthelwig's relationship with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was acting as the abbot's diocesan bishop, appears to have been tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during Æthelwig's abbacy, Æthelwig was not there. Although in legal matters Wulfstan and Æthelwig were in conflict, personally, Æthelwig is said to have regarded Wulfstan as a father figure, and as the abbot's confessor. The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle appears to have been reworked after 1100 to gloss over embarrassing incidents of the abbots submitting to the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of Æthelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.
During Edward's reign, Æthelwig worked to recover some of the abbey's estates that had been granted to others in the past but had not been returned to the abbey's custody. He managed to restore the abbey's possession of a number of these lost estates. A large section of the description of the abbot's life in the "Chronicon" is concerned with a listing of estates that Æthelwig acquired or recovered. The estates listed were in the counties of Worcestershire, Warwickshire, and Gloucestershire.
After the Conquest.
After the Norman Conquest, Æthelwig was trusted by the new king, William the Conqueror, and given some administrative duties. Æthelwig was one of a very small number of native Englishmen trusted by the king, which group included Ealdred and Wulfstan. Probably in 1069, Æthelwig was given authority in the former lands of the Mercian kingdom. After the deposition of Godric, the abbot of Winchcombe Abbey in 1070, Æthelwig served as his jailor. In 1072, Æthelwig was acting as a royal judge in the western part of England. During the rebellion of 1075, Æthelwig kept Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, one of the rebels, from joining up with the other rebels. In this action, Æthelwig was assisted by Wulfstan, as well as the sheriff of Worcestershire, Urse d'Abetot. Æthelwig also took the opportunity after the Norman Conquest to acquire more lands, obtaining 36 estates by redeeming loans. Æthelwig used his knowledge of English law not only on his own account, but to aid the new Norman ecclesiasitcs, such as Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Serlo, the Abbot of Gloucester. A number of English landowners commended themselves into Æthelwig's care after the Conquest, and this led to conflicts over who owned the lands after Æthelwig's death.
Although Æthelwig was known for his loyalty to King William, he had an uncle who held land at Witton who died fighting for King Harold Godwinson, probably at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. While abbot, even after the Conquest, Æthelwig continued to build and ornament his abbey in the Anglo-Saxon style, not the Norman Romanesque which was being used in many of the other churches and abbeys. Besides his administrative and legal duties, Æthelwig was known for his care for the sick and the poor, as well as lepers. After the Harrying of the North by King William in 1069–1070, Æthelwig offered shelter to refugees from the ravaged areas. The "Chronicon" states that Æthelwig offered aid to the refugees because of his charitable nature, but it is possible that it was also part of his royal duties in western England.
Æthelwig also administered Winchcombe Abbey for a number of years, at first from 1066 to 1069 when a Norman monk was appointed abbot, and then again from 1075 until Æthelwig's death. Hemming, a medieval monastic writer from Worcester Priory, wrote of Æthelwig that he "surpassed everyone by his intelligence, his shrewdness and his knowledge of worldly law". The "Chronicon" reports that Æthelwig suffered from gout, and states that it was the cause of his death.
Æthelwig died in either 1077 or 1078. The "Chronicon" gives his death date as 16 February 1077, but it is unclear if the "Chronicon" began its years on 1 January or in March, so the date could be 1077 or 1078.
Writing about Æthelwig.
A near-contemporary account of Æthelwig's life, or "Vita", is included in the "Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham", the monastic chronicle for Evesham Abbey. This was a 13th-century work by Thomas of Marlborough, which was written to bolster the Evesham's case for exemption from the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Worcester, in whose diocese Evensham was. In order to do this, Thomas incorporated earlier works dealing with Evesham's history, including the work on Æthelwig. However, because of Thomas' purpose in composing the "Chronicon", he probably altered some of the texts he included, and it appears that the life of Æthelwig was first incorporated into a complete history of the abbey and then that composit work was adapted by Thomas into his "Chronicon". The main evidence for this is internal stylistic evidence, where the Æthelwig material is stylistic uniform with other material dating to prior to 1077, with information after 1077 forming a separate writing style.
The historian R. R. Darlington argued that the "Vita" was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it more likely to have been written shortly after Æthelwig's death. The work itself is not a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.

In the mid-1960s, a club in Barrio Norte, Buenos Aires named "La Cueva" was the focal point for rock and roll. Some of the acts were in English, but others were experimenting Spanish language lyrics, notably Tanguito. The regulars of "La Cueva" also included poetry buffs and young people willing to escape the routines of urban life; some would form the core of the Buenos Aires hippie scene of the late 1960s.
Miguel Peralta was living in the "Norte" hostel at that time, and was lured into the scene by fellow poetry buff Pipo Lernoud. When a record label, Mandioca, was created specifically to record Spanish language rock, Peralta arranged for an interview with recording executive Ben Molar where he claimed, untruthfully, that he had a band called "Los Abuelos de la Nada" (the Grandparents of Nothingness) which was ready to enter the studio. The name was taken from a passage in "Severo Arcángelo", a book by Leopoldo Marechal. Since Molar acquiesced, Peralta went on and assembled a band, featuring friends Claudio Gabis on guitar, Alberto Lara on bass, Héctor "Pomo" Lorenzo on drums, and Eduardo "Mayoneso" on keyboards. Their first single, "Diana Divaga" (Diana wanders), featured psychedelic influences. About this time, Miguel started using "Abuelo" as his artistic surname.
After Gabis left (he was attending college and was reluctant to commit to the band), Abuelo drafted Norberto Napolitano (Pappo). After some more psychedelic-oriented fare, Pappo started nudging the band in the direction of blues, causing Abuelo to leave. Over time, Pappo's project mutated into Pappo's Blues.
Abuelo tried to create new bands, and for a short time was singer of "El Huevo" (the Egg), which would later become the core of Pescado Rabioso. Abuelo took off to Barcelona in 1971 to try to re-create his career. Abuelo spent ten years in Europe, until bass player Cachorro López, who was a popular session musician with reggae and funk bands, convinced him to return to Argentina for a second incarnation of the "Abuelos".
1981–83: Comeback and the new beginning.
The new band had Abuelo as lead singer, Cachorro López on bass guitar, Andrés Calamaro on vocals and keyboards, Gustavo Bazterrica on guitar, Daniel Melingo on sax, and Polo Corbella on the drums.
The 1982 Falklands War () was a catalyst for Argentine rock, as songs with English-language lyrics were not broadcast for several months. The band's materials were favored by radio DJs, including "No te enamores nunca de aquel marinero bengalí" (Never fall in love with that Bengali sailor) which grew out of improvisation during rehearsals, and "Sin gamulán" (Without a coat), written by Calamaro.
Charly García took the band under his wing after dissolving Serú Girán, and the Abuelos played in García's 1982 Christmas concert. García also drafted López, Melingo and Calamaro for his band, in parallel with their work for the "Abuelos".
The 1982 debut album included many compositions by Abuelo-López, and a reggae hit by Calamaro's former partner Gringui Herrera, "Tristezas de la ciudad" (City blues).
For their 1983 album, "Vasos y Besos" (Glasses and Kisses), Melingo wrote his own reggae hit: "Chala-man", Bazterrica contributed "No se desesperen" (Don't despair), and Calamaro chimed in with "Mil horas" (A thousand hours).
1984–85: International breakthrough, struggles and break-up.
The band became popular with rockers and more pop-oriented audiences. Especially, Calamaro was favored by teenage girls looking for an "edgier" idol than balladeer Alejandro Lerner. "Vasos y Besos" had sold a solid 160,000 records, and was presented in a six-month country-wide tour.
Record executives arranged to send the band to Ibiza for the recording of their 1984 album "Himno de mi Corazón" (Hymn of my heart), became a sales hit as expected. Later that year, Melingo, who was also working with García and his own band Los Twist, and was replaced by Alfredo Desiata.
By early 1985, the band's spirits were damaged due to Bazterrica's cocaine addiction, which eventually had him fired from the band, and the rivalry between Abuelo and Calamaro for top billing.
About that time, Calamaro wrote what would be his last mega-hit with the band: "Costumbres argentinas" (Argentine habits). Sensing that the band was on the verge of dissolution, the band recorded a live album in the Opera theater in Buenos Aires on May 1985. For the occasion, Gringui Herrera replaced Bazterrica, Juan del Barrio reinforced Calamaro in keyboards, and Melingo played some songs as a guest musician.
This line-up played their last gig on October 1985, in the Vélez Sársfield stadium, to fulfill their contractual obligation to the "Rock and Pop" festival which featured INXS and Nina Hagen. The crowd reacted badly to the band's evident lack of motivation (the pouring rain and the badly mixed sound did not help), and Abuelo was hit in the face by a bottle hurled from the field. The band played the remainder of their set with Abuelo visibly bleeding. After the show, Los Abuelos members are disbanded indefinitely.
1986–88: Revival and Miguel Abuelo's death.
With the band dissolved, Abuelo started playing small venues, harking back to his roots of poetry-influenced songwriting. Late in 1986, he and Polo Corbella hired to Kubero Díaz on guitar, Marcelo "Chocolate" Fogo on bass and Juan del Barrio on keyboards to form a new line-up, which recorded "Cosas mías" in 1986 with relative commercial success. After the first shows, Polo Corbella left the band, replaced by Claudio "Pato" Loza, then with the addition of Willy Crook on sax.
In late 1987, following gallbladder surgery, Miguel Abuelo was diagnosed with AIDS; terminally ill, he died from cardiac arrest a few days after his 42nd birthday. That was the end of the "Abuelos" as a band; the remaining members reunited several times, with different formations. Notably, Miguel's son Gato played with Calamaro, Bazterrica and Corbella in a 1997 re-union.
The rights to the "Abuelos de la Nada" name were offered by Abuelo's widow Krisha Bogdan to Kubero Díaz, who refused out of respect. At some point during 2001, it was reported [http://www.deepcamboya.com.ar/abuelosbio.htm] that Bogdan and Gato were fighting in court over the rights to the name and to Miguel Abuelo's unpublished recordings.
Legacy.
Several compilations mastered by López were issued after the band's demise. The band eventually sold more records after its dissolution than during its successes of the 1980s. Many former "Abuelos" are still in the limelight, notably Calamaro, who has had a successful career in both Argentina and Spain.

Runes of Magic

"Not to be confused with RuneScape."
Runes of Magic (RoM) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by the Taiwanese developer Runewaker Entertainment and adapted for the English and German-speaking market by German company Frogster Interactive. Frogster has also opened servers for France, Spain, Poland, Netherlands, and Australia as well as servers dedicated to the European Union. After going through an open beta phase, the game was launched on March 19, 2009 and Chapter II – The Elven Prophecy was launched on September 15, 2009. The next chapter, Chapter III – The Elder Kingdoms, started April 22, 2010, however all of Chapter III did not become available until August 11, 2010. Chapter IV - Lands of Despair, was released June 16, 2011. The latest Chapter, Chapter V - Fires of Shadowforge, was released on June 12, 2012. The game client is free to download, and no monthly subscription fee is required because the service is funded by real money transactions (RMT) in the Runes of Magic Item Shop.
Features.
The game has very few differences from World of Warcraft, one of the differences being the "multi-class" feature, which allows the player to choose up to three classes. At Level 10, the player may choose a second class. At Level 20, the player may choose a third class. Each 66 combinations of classes has sets of Elite Skills, which make each class combination unique, such that a "Warrior/Priest" has completely different skills from a "Priest/Warrior". As of the current version of the game, there are 10 Elite Skills for each class combination, with the first given when two classes are Level 15. The subsequent Elite Skills would be give when both classes gained an additional 5 levels up to 50/50, then every 10 levels after that another Elite Skill is given, up to 70/70.
The game features Player versus Player combat in the form of dueling and battlefields. Players may obtain their own houses, and guilds can buy castles that grant benefits to members of the guild. Siege combat is available between guilds called Siege War, which is under open beta-testing, available to all guilds.
Another feature of the game are the collectible "Monster Cards", which slain foes leave behind, which provide specific attribute points alongside the usual monster information. These cards act as trophies for players but also provide attribute bonuses. Each type of monster has a card that provides bonuses to character stats, but not every monster drops the cards.
Players can also obtain magical pets, who accompany the player and may participate in combat under certain conditions regarding the pet statistics, i.e. loyalty. Pets are obtained by using traps to catch a Magic Cavy which are sometimes dropped after defeating an enemy monster. After catching the Magic Cavy, the player will be randomly given a Pet Egg, from which the player can summon a pet to assist in the player's adventures.
Through the use of real-money transactions, a player is able to exchange cash for in-game currency referred to as Diamonds. Players are able to buy in-game items using Diamonds through the Cash Shop interface in the game client. Buying items in the Cash Shop using Diamonds also awards Rubies, which can also be used to buy items in the Cash Shop. Diamonds can also be used to gift other players items for cash or fun.
A new marriage system feature was added in early July 2010. The marriage system is relationship system that allows two players to commit into a partnership. Depending on the relationship, players will then be rewarded with special in-game bonuses. Special Items have been added too such as Love and Friendship letters.
For each character, they will be provided a residence and a basic housekeeper. The residence may be decorated with furniture items bought from the Cash Shop or created with some recipes. Furniture may provide storage for items, bonus experience and talent points. They may also buy additional housekeepers, who unlike the basic housekeeper, can also provide free buffs, food, and potions after the initial purchase. To buy a housekeeper, the player requires only in-game gold, the primary currency of the game.
Players may collect Item Sets, gear sets from all over the game, from which Item-Set Skills can be extracted to provide additional versatility to the player. Pieces of each Item-Sets are typically dropped from instances in various parts of the game.
Chapters.
The game's major patches are referred to as "Chapters". So far five chapters have been released; the latest being released June 12, 2012.
Classes.
There are a total of 10 different character classes available in Runes of Magic. These are: Warrior, Scout, Rogue, Mage, Priest, Knight, Druid, Warden, Champion, and Warlock. With respect to the below class-restrictions, there are 66 possible class combinations.
The character race you choose to play will determine which 10 of those classes you have access to when creating your character, but the classes change depending on your particular race, such that:
Each class separates two distinct set of skills: "General" and "Primary".
"General" skills of a particular class can be used when the class equipped is the Main or Secondary Class. "Primary" skills of a class can only be used when the class is equipped as the Main Class, but is not available when equipped as the Secondary Class.
Knight: Knights are the heaviest armored class in the game; the only one able to wear plate armor. With their special light-based attacks and shield abilities, knights fight their enemies effectively and draw their hatred over themselves.
Warrior: Warriors are masters in the use of arms, and can handle every close combat weapon while also being able to wear all kinds of armors, including chain mail. Driven by their battle rage they attack the enemy with special combinations of strikes and blows, and aim to increase the momentum of their attacks. They can also channel their rage into passive abilities to strengthen themselves or to provoke opponents and to scare them with an impressive display of their fury.
Rogue: Rogues are specialists in inflicting physical damage. In close range they use dagger techniques, and use ranged weapons for long range attacks. In contrast to warriors and scouts, rogues rely on subtle methods, such as stealth attacks, poison, and various techniques which inflict bleeding wounds. Rogues manage to avoid most trouble thanks to their swiftness and agility.
Scout: Scouts are masters in long range combat, and use their abilities to bring their bow and crossbow skills to perfection. In close combat they depend on evasion and delaying tactics to get into range for another shot or to wait for reinforcements who feel more at home in close range combat. Specially boosted long range attacks can defeat opponents in a short amount of time.
Priest: While priests are able to defend, restore hit points and increase stats of their companions, they also have the power to bring their fallen comrades back to life. They can wield shields; and only they have the ability to use the element of water to deal magical damage. However, their most important role remains calling out for godly assistance and mending wounds during battle.
Druid: Due to a close connection with nature, Druids are able to use their powers to fulfill their own wishes. Through them an additional resource has entered into Runes of Magic: Nature's Power. Through special skills, Druids build up more and more of Nature's Power and can release it at a given time to perform especially powerful spells. However, it is their diversity which makes Druids so special. They are powerful healers, who support the group's priests with rapid healing spells.
Mage: Magicians attack with fire and lightning and inflict high magical damage. Some of their spells can enclose wide-ranging areas with fiery walls and keep whole hordes of monsters in check, although utility is phased out endgame. Seasoned magicians are said to be able to harness the power of the Phoenix. With the help of their arcane knowledge, they can protect themselves and their companions from harm, or increase the strength of the entire party.
Warden: The Warden has the most diverse variety of weapons at his disposal and is masterful in their use. The ability to wear chain armour also affords him the necessary protection to emerge victorious from battle. He is also able to draw on an arsenal of varied magical abilities. They serve mainly to weaken an opponent and to strengthen themselves. His true strengths are played out, however, in conjunction with one of his three faithful companions whom he can command in combat. The companion has the ability to go up against several enemies, keeping these occupied while the Warden himself swiftly and effortlessly subjugates his target.
With the addition of Chapter V: The Fires of Shadowforge, two classes was implemented restricted to the new race, Shadowforge Dwarves: "Champion" and "Warlock".
Champion: These runic soldiers attack with brute strength and harness the mystic forge techniques of Dwarven blacksmiths. Champions are also able to transform into the Runic Shield Form for increased durability and accuracy forming an effective damage dealer as well as improved survivability.
Warlock: Arcane masters of Dark Magic specializing in curses weakening their enemies for a subsequent finishing blow. With enough accumulation of Psi during battle, the Warlock can choose one of two stances, Willpower Blade or Willpower Construct. The former for more powerful damage spells, while the latter provides support spells for the caster and party negating damage and improving attack speed and spell casting.
Customization.
Each avatar has five statistics: Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Intelligence and Wisdom. The base values are determined by the main class. If a second class is selected, an additional 10% of the base values of the secondary class are added to the main class statistics. The values of the statistic are determined by the level of each respective class.
In general:
In addition to acquiring weapons, armor, and accessories for each avatar, the player may also enchant additional statistics into the equipment improving health, mana, defense, physical attack, magical attack, and other attributes. These enhancing statistics are commonly referred to as a "stat." Stats can have 1 or more attributes. For example, "Frost of Imprisonment VIII" has 2 attributes: Stamina +57 and Wisdom +57, while "Vigor I" has only 1 attribute: Strength +3. The color of the stat determines how many attributes are improved.
Types of Stats
In addition to the color of the stat, each stat has a corresponding tier, which determines the value of the stat, such that a tier 1 stat, Strength I, increases Strength by 3, while a tier 2 stat, Strength II, increases Strength by 6.
In higher tier stats, the value of the statistic is determined by name of the stat. For example, a stat with the word, "Imprisonment," in the name increases the value of the specific stat by 57, whereas, the word "Temple" would denote an increase of 76. In addition to the five main statistics, stats may also increase an attribute, such as defense, physical attack, magical attack, and health points directly.
Up to six differently named stats can be added to any piece of equipment.
In addition to stats, each equipment may also hold runes, which also increase attributes of the avatar. Some pieces may have rune slots when found, but to have 4, the maximum possible, the player must purchase a "Driller" to make additional slots for runes.
Dungeons.
The game's dungeons are split into three types: large player-versus-player open-world dungeons, small instances for six players, and large instances (or raids) for 12 players. There is also a 120-player dungeon under the first main city, Varanas.
Siege War.
Siege War involves two guilds fighting for strategic points, Crystal Towers, on the battlefield using PvP combat and Siege-exclusive structures placed by players. Each guild, at the start of battle, commands a Guild Castle and three Crystal Towers. The goal for each guild is to have in possession the majority of the Crystal Towers within the time limit, or to take the opponent's Honor Crystal located in opponent's Guild Castle for five minutes to secure a victory.
To obtain structures or vehicles, players in each guild must obtain Merits and Crystals. Merits are obtain through killing enemy players and balloon mobs on the field. Merits can also be obtained by collecting from the Crystal Towers. Crystals are obtain through the collecting from the Crystal Towers and exchanging Merits for a Crystal Extraction Gem. Players in Siege War can obtain static structures capable of attacking players, such as Flame Towers and Electric Towers. They may also obtain structures that inhibit enemy movement, such as the Faces of Treachery. Guilds may also build siege vehicles to assist in battle, such as Ballistae, Battering Rams and Catapults.
Crafting.
Players may learn Professions, which include:
With the exception of Planting, the player may increase the level of all their professions up to Level 20. However afterwards, the player is limited to choosing 6 professions up to Level 40, 3 up to Level 60, and 1 up to Level 80. Planting may be increased to Level 80 regardless of player choice. Each crafting profession may be learned by any class or race in the game.
Reception.
"Runes of Magic" has been compared to "World of Warcraft" and also referred to as a clone, but Eurogamer's Daniel Etherington discounted this and stated the view "misses the point." Wesley Yin-Poole of Videogamer.com stated "The guys at Runewaker have clearly constructed Runes of Magic with World of Warcraft running in the background." He stated that despite being "somewhat of a WoW clone" and free-to-play, "Runes of Magic" contains elements which "World of Warcraft" does not, and that the latter's developers "would do well to consider." Online gaming website Massively's Shawn Schuster highlighted the range of crafting abilities in the game, as well as the ability to gain proficiency in them all without penalties. ""Runes of Magic" has these features we see in a triple-A MMO, yet it's a free-to-play RMT-based game." Jeremy Stratton has also written several weekly articles on Massively, with his "Lost Pages of Taborea" column, between March 23, 2010 and October 10, 2011.
According to Frogster 20,000 players created 100,000 characters on the first day of the game's open beta; December 15, 2008, rising to 450,000 characters by February 2009. On May 14, 2009, Frogster announced that one million users in Europe and North America have registered to play Runes of Magic. On August 16, 2010, after the launch of chapter III, they announced that Runes of Magic had exceeded four million registered users.
Awards.
Runes of Magic won the German Game Developer Award for Best International PC Game of 2009. It also won nine awards in Massively's Reader's Choice and Staff Choice Awards in that same year, which included the Reader's Choice Awards for:
Frogster International won the award for Best MMO Studio of 2009 on behalf of the developer of Runes of Magic, Runewaker Entertainment. Runes of Magic also won both the Reader's Choice Award and Staff Choice Award for the Best Launch of 2009.
In 2010, Runes of Magic was awarded for the second year in a row the German Game Developers Award for Best Online Game of 2010.
IP Blocks for Specific Countries.
Turkey.
After the scheduled maintenance on July 12, 2010 all players connecting from Turkey got an error message titled as "Unknown Error" when tried to log-in. After receiving numerous complaints about connection issues, Frogster Online announced that the license holder of Runes of Magic in Turkey, GamersFirst, requested from Frogster Online to issue an IP block on Turkey. Later on, GamersFirst closed their Runes of Magic (named as "Sonsuz Macera" by the Turkish publisher) servers and passed the license to Aeria Games, however, players from Turkey still have no access to European Runes of Magic servers as of today.
Middle East.
On September 7, 2010 the license holder of Runes of Magic in the Middle East, Tahadi Games, requested from Frogster Online to issue an IP block banning all Middle Eastern users from the European servers. Users from the following areas were no longer able to log into the European version of the game and got an error message: Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Sudan and Mauritania. The reason behind the IP ban request was that Tahadi Games obtained the rights to market Runes of Magic in both English and Arabic in the Middle East Region.
On 31 June, All servers of Runes of Magic has been shutting down in the Middle East by the license holder of Runes of Magic in the Middle East, Tahadi Games.

Jay Cooke &amp; Company

Jay Cooke & Company was a U.S. bank from 1861 to 1873. It was the first brokerage house to use telegraph messages to confirm with clients the purchase and sale of securities. Headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, it had branches in New York City and Washington, D.C. The bank closed during the Panic of 1873, overextended in railroad securities.
Biography.
Early years.
Jay Cooke founded the bank in 1861 with William E.C. Moorhead, the ownership split two-thirds to one-third. Later partners included Cooke's brothers, Henry and Pitt, then H.C. Fahnestock and Edward Dodge, who would hold the bank's seat on the New York Stock Exchange after 1870.
During the American Civil War, Cooke & Company sold hundreds of millions of dollars in Union government bonds. Its reputation among investors around the world enabled the bank to sell these bonds when other brokerages could not. Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase asked Cooke to try to sell the government's new $500 million issue of 5-20 bonds. These paid six percent interest (in gold) and matured in 20 years, but were callable in five years. Cooke used numerous agents from a variety of professions — small bankers, insurance agents, and real estate professionals — to sell these bonds to support the Union war effort. Cooke & Company's innovative use of the telegraph to confirm sales allowed selling throughout the country to be coordinated in Philadelphia.
After the war.
After the war, Cooke & Company continued to fund its investments through the sale of US treasuries. After the Black Friday scare, however, it became apparent that Cooke & Company would have to find other sources of capital. The firm turned to investing in railroads. In 1870, the Northern Pacific Railroad made Cooke & Company its exclusive bond agent. But Cooke had difficulty marketing the bonds to investors, wound up owning 75 percent of the company, and overextended his bank. As this liability became public, investors began withdrawing money from Cooke & Company.
Cooke & Company wrote liabilities against expected returns from the sale of its Northern Pacific Railroad bonds, but ultimately could not sell enough bonds to meet its obligations. A run on the bank ensued, and its operations were suspended. When the New York Stock Exchange heard the announcement, equities plummeted, causing a chain reaction of bank runs and failures throughout the United States that signaled the arrival of the Panic of 1873 to American shores.
Bankruptcy commenced soon after the collapse. Many of the junior partners at Cooke did not suffer when the bank collapsed because they anticipated the failure and had divested from assets that would crumble if Cooke became insolvent. The government seized most of Cooke's larger estates while Cooke moved to one of his smaller properties. Many of Cooke's allies in the banking business soon collapsed, including Livermore, Clews & Co. and Fisk & Hatch.
In 1880, a former executive of Jay Cooke refused to testify before Congress and was found in contempt and detained. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to release him in "Kilbourn v. Thompson".

Gillian Raine

Gillian Raine (b. Gillian Mary Lorraine, Ceylon now Sri Lanka, 28 December 1926/7) is an actress and was the wife of the actor Leonard Rossiter from 1964-1984 (his death), though they had been living together since 1962. They had one daughter, Camilla (b. 1972). 
Raine has appeared in a variety of repertory theatre, TV drama and film productions. Her theatre works includes "Hedda Gabler" (as Juliana Tesman), 2005, at The Duke of York's Theatre, Richard Eyre’s production of "La Grande Magia" for the National Theatre, Mike Bradwell’s "Mackerel Sky" at the Bush Theatre and Bill Bryden’s production of "A Month in the Country" at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre and in the West End at the Albery Theatre. Film work includes "Darling" and "A Night to Remember" and on television "Kiss Me Kate", "Suddenly Last Summer", "Vanity Fair", "A Very Peculiar Practice" and "Under the Hammer".

The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries

The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries is an 1812 painting by Jacques-Louis David. It shows French Emperor Napoleon I in uniform in his study at the Tuileries Palace. Despite the detail, it is unlikely that Napoleon posed for the portrait.
It was a private commission from the Scottish nobleman and admirer of Napoleon, Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton in 1811 and completed in 1812. Originally shown at Hamilton Palace, it was sold to Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery in 1882, from whom it was bought by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1954, which deposited it in Washington DC's National Gallery of Art, where it now hangs. 
Iconography.
Vertical in format, it shows Napoleon standing, three-quarters life size, wearing the uniform of a colonel of the Imperial Guard Foot Grenadiers (blue with white facings and red cuffs). He also wears his Légion d'honneur and Order of the Iron Crown decorations, along with gold epaulettes, white French-style culottes and white stockings. His face is turned towards the viewer and his right hand is in his jacket.
The office is on the right-hand first-floor of the Tuileries, with a wooden chair decorated in red velvet and gold embroidery and an Empire style desk on a sculpted stone base decorated with a lion's head. Piled on the desk are a pen, several books, dossiers and rolled papers. More rolled papers and a map are on the green carpet to the desk's left - on these papers is the painter's signature "LVDci DAVID OPVS 1812". All this, along with Napoleons' unbuttoned cuffs, wrinkled stockings, disheveled hair, the flickering candles and the time on the clock (4.13am) are all meant to imply he has been up all night, writing laws such as the Code Napoleon - the word "Code" is prominent on the rolled papers on the desk. This maintains his new civil rather than heroic (as in Canova's "Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker") or military (as in David's own "Napoleon Crossing the Alps") image, though the sword on the chair's armrest still refers back to his military successes. The fleurs-de-lys and heraldic bees also imply the stability of the imperial dynasty.
Second version.
A second version painted by David, showing exactly the same scene but with Napoleon in his more everyday green mounted chasseurs uniform, was formerly in Prince Napoleon's collection and has since 1979 been in that of the Château de Versailles.
Development.
An analysis of the original painting reveals that the artist reedited the composition and details several times to balance the image, add allusions, and capture an complete story.
Brush strokes and texture indicate that an earlier version had
Napoleon's upper body flanked by two fluted columns about the width
of the figure's torso. These strong vertical elements would have create an
distraction from the central figure.
These columns were revised to a carved panel in shadow (on the viewer's
left) and a clock with a large face (viewer's right) on level with and
somewhat larger than the figure's face. The clock was later repainted
with a smaller face moved up and to the right, with the clock body still
covering the underlying column brush strokes.
These revisions greatly improved the compositional balance of the
painting's upper section, reducing the impression of three vertical
columns. They successfully moved the viewers focus to Napoleon's face and
expression and away from the presumably accurate stature and
middle-heavy build.
The change also allowed incorporating additional symbology, most notably
the time (4:13).
Other revisions were added symbols on the table items and lower section,
many painted over fleurs-de-lis which are conspicuously rare in the final image.

Michele Maylender

Michele Maylender () (September 11, 1863 – 1911) was a Hungarian politician who was the founder of the Autonomist Association, known also as Autonomist Party in Fiume. 
Michele Maylender was born in Fiume (today Rijeka) as a son of a Jewish merchant. After schooling in Fiume Maylender went to Kolosvar and then to Budapest to study law. In 1888 he became doctor juris and in 1890 passes the exams for a lawyer. In 1891 he opens a legal office in Fiume, where he showed excellent professional skills. Maylender was among the founders in 1893 of a literary circle, which became the largest Italian cultural venue in Fiume. 
In 1896 Maylender, claiming greater autonomy from the centralizing Hungarian executive of Dezső Bánffy, founded the Autonomist Party. The initiative was successful and in 1897 Maylender was elected mayor, succeeding to the late Giovanni de Ciotta, who held the position continuously from 1872 to 1896. The election of Maylender was the decisive signal of political change under way in Fiume. It culminated when the Municipal council of Fiume was dissolved and was finally replaced by a Royal Commissioner, the ministerial adviser Antonio de Valentsits in 1898. After that Maylender started a weekly magazine "La Difesa" where the autonomist claims were made explicit. 
When in 1901 Kálmán Széll succeeded to Dezső Bánffy as Hungarian Prime Minister he seriously tried to restore a positive climate in the city, and Maylender was once again elected to the office of mayor. Meanwhile, the mandate of the fiuman deputy at the Hungarian parliament was about to expire. In the new climate the majority of the Autonomist Party thought "it was time to send an Italian" (the office was held by Count Tivadar Batthyány) and it addressed Maylender. Maylender refused, and Luigi Ossoinack(head of the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company "Adria", and, as one of the wealthiest fiumani, the main funder of the Autonomist Party) decided to advance the candidacy of the young Riccardo Zanella. Although Batthyány (publicly backed by Maylender) won over Zanella, Maylender resigned few months after and withdrew from politics, officially he devoted himself to historical studies and started the monumental "History of the Academies of Italy" a work, published posthumously, of still unmatched scope.
Maylender returned to active politics in 1911, when he accepted to run as Fiuman deputy at the Hungarian parliament. He was elected but died suddenly hit by a stroke at the couloirs of the parliament in Budapest in 1911.
He was not related to Samuel Maylender, a physician and socialist leader in Fiume, who later joined the Communist Party of Fiume in 1921. The sister Edvige Maylender married Antonio Grossich, world-known surgeon who in 1908 introduced tincture of iodine for rapid sterilisation of the human skin, and future head of the Italian National Council of Fiume in 1918.

Peter Pursell

Peter Pursell (1 July 1894 – 14 August 1968) was a Scottish footballer. A defender, he won one cap for Scotland in 1914. He was the younger brother of Robert Russell Pursell, and the father of Robert Wilson Pursell.
He spent time with Campbeltown Academicals and Queens Park, before joining Rangers in 1914. He helped the club to the league title in 1917–18 and 1918–19, before he signed with English club Port Vale for a £2,500 fee in August 1919. He spent five years with the Vale, before joining Wigan Borough for a two-year spell. He later became player-manager at non-league side Congleton Town and then manager at Dutch outfit Dordrecht.
Club career.
Pursell played for Campbeltown Academicals and Queens Park, before joining Rangers in 1914. He made 31 appearances in 1914–15, as the club finished third in Division One. He played 20 games in 1915–16, as "Gers" finished second behind Old Firm rivals Celtic. The Ibrox Park club again finished third in 1916–17, before winning the league title in 1917–18, with Pursell making 24 appearances. He featured 23 times in 1918–19, as the "Teddy Bears" retained the league title.
He joined Port Vale for a £2,500 fee in August 1919. When Vale were elected to the Football League two months later, the club had to fork out an extra £500 to Rangers for the services of Pursell and Willie Aitken. He played 49 of the club's 51 games in 1919–20, and also helped Vale to lift the Staffordshire Senior Cup and North Staffordshire Infirmary Cup. He played alongside brother Bob in 1920–21, making 34 Second Division appearances. He featured 32 times in 1921–22, though his brother was forced to retire with a broken leg. Pursell featured 42 times in 1922–23 and 25 times in 1923–24, before leaving The Old Recreation Ground for Wigan Borough at the end of the campaign. Pursell played a total of 183 matches for the Vale without finding the net. He played 35 Third Division North games for Wigan, helping the club to finish 11th in 1924–25 and 17th in 1925–26.
International career.
Pursell received his sole Scotland cap on 28 February 1914, in a British Home Championship match against Wales which ended in a 0–0 draw.

<doc id="21394596" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21394596" title="Agriculture in Cyprus">
Agriculture in Cyprus

When Cyprus achieved independence in 1960, the backbone of its economy was agriculture, mostly small farms, and sometimes even subsistence farms. During the 1960s, irrigation projects made possible vegetable and fruit exports; increasingly commercialized farming was able to meet the demands for meat, dairy products, and wine from the British and United Nations troops stationed on the island and from the growing number of tourists.
In the early 1970s, Cypriot farms, still overwhelmingly small owner-run units, furnished about 70 percent of commodity exports and employed about 95,000 people, or one-third of the island's economically active population. Given the expansion of the manufacturing and service sectors, however, agriculture's importance was declining, and in the first half of the 1970s its share of GDP amounted to 18 percent.
The de facto division of the island in 1974 left the Turkish Cypriot community in the north in possession of agricultural resources that produced about four-fifths of the citrus and cereal crops, two-thirds of the green fodder, and all of the tobacco. The south retained nearly all of the island's grapegrowing areas and deciduous fruit orchards. The south also possessed lands producing roughly three-fourths of the valuable potato crop and other vegetables (excluding carrots), half the island's olive trees, and two-thirds of its carob trees. In addition, the south retained two-thirds of the livestock population.
The Turkish occupation caused a large-scale uncoordinated exchange of the agricultural work force between the northern and southern zones. The resulting substantial agricultural unemployment was countered by government actions that included financial assistance on easy terms to farmers. By 1978 the number of persons working in agriculture in the government-controlled area amounted to about 47,000, or 23 percent of the working population. Thereafter, however, agriculture's portion of the work force declined to 20.7 percent in 1979 and 15.8 percent in 1987. Its contribution to the economy also declined; from 17.3 percent of GDP in 1976 to 10.7 percent in 1979 and 7.7 percent in 1988. This share was important to the south's economy, however, and in 1988 value added in agriculture, at constant 1985 prices, was C£112.7 million.
Agriculture's share of the national economy declined further in the 1990s, as the Greek Cypriot economy became even more dominated by the service sector. The island's favorable climate and its location near its leading market, Western Europe, however, meant that farming remains an important and stable part of the overall economy. Government irrigation projects, subsidies, and tax policies encouraged farming's existence, as did research in new crops and new varieties of ones already in cultivation.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources oversaw efforts to improve agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Subordinate to this ministry and assisting it were, among others, the Agricultural Research Institute, the Veterinary Service, the Meteorological Service, the Department of Water Development, the Department of Forests, and the Department of Geological Survey.
In addition to macroeconomic considerations, the government encouraged agriculture because it provided rural employment, which maintained village life and relieved urban crowding. Small-scale agricultural activity prevented some regions from losing much of their population. Part-time agricultural work also permitted urban residents to keep in contact with their villages and gave them supplemental income.
Water resources.
Cyprus's water supply was both inadequate and irregular. The average rainfall of 500 mm, mostly in the winter, left the island quite dry much of the rest of the time because no rivers flowed year round. During the colonial period, a dam and reservoir construction program was begun, and by independence Cyprus had sixteen dams with a storage capacity of six million cubic meters, or 1 percent of the island's estimated 600 million cubic meters of usable runoff from annual rainfall.
After independence a number of large projects were mounted to increase reservoir storage capacity, which reached 300 million cubic meters by 1990. The most important of these projects, and the largest development project in Cyprus since independence, was the Southern Conveyor Project, which collected surplus water from the southwestern part of the island and conveyed it by a 110-kilometer long water carrier to the central and eastern areas. When the project reached completion in 1993, it, and a number of other large projects, would guarantee farmers and the inhabitants of Nicosia and other towns adequate amounts of water into the next century.
Land use and tenure.
Three categories of landownership existed in Cyprus during the Ottoman period: private, state, and communal. This division continued to characterize landholding in the Greek Cypriot area in 1990. Most land was privately owned. The largest private landowner was the Church of Cyprus, whose holdings before the Turkish invasion included an estimated 5.8 percent of the island's arable land.
Unrestricted legal ownership of private land dated only from 1946, when the British administration enacted a new land law that superseded the land code in effect under the Ottomans, in which all agricultural land belonged to the state. Those who worked the land were in effect hereditary tenants, whose right to the land was usufructuary. Land could be transmitted from father to son, but could not be disposed of otherwise without official permission.
The Immovable Property (Tenure, Registration, and Valuation) Law of 1946 established the present-day legal basis for landholding. All former state lands that had been properly acquired by individuals were declared to be private property; private property as defined in the former Ottoman land code also continued to be private property. Communal land remained the property of villages or towns, and all unoccupied and vacant land not lawfully held (most forest land, for example) became state land.
Both Greek and Turkish inheritance practices required the division of an estate among the surviving heirs. At the time of the 1946 law, fragmentation of land was already great, many holdings did not have access roads, and owners frequently possessed varying numbers of plots that might be separated by distances of several kilometers.
Despite the 1946 law, however, fragmentation of plots continued. The 1946 census showed 60,179 holdings averaging 7.2 hectares. By 1960 the number of holdings had risen to 69,445, an increase of 15.4 percent, and the average holding had decreased to 6.2 hectares. By 1974 the average holding was an estimated 5 hectares. Holdings were seldom a single piece of land; most consisted of small plots, an average of ten per holding in 1960. In some villages, the average number of plots was 40, and extremes of 100 plots held by a single farmer were reported.
The government enacted the Land Consolidation Law of 1969 to resolve the problem of land tenure. The law established the Central Land Consolidation Authority, with the power to buy and also acquire compulsorily land and other property, which it could sell or use for land consolidation. The authority's board included members of several ministries and departments and also representatives of the farmers. At the village level, committees of government representatives and local farmers coordinated and supervised the local program.
Land consolidation consisted of merging fragmented holdings. Dual and multiple holdings were to be eliminated, and plots smaller than the minimums listed in the 1946 land law were to be expropriated. Government-owned land could be used to enlarge holdings; recipients could purchase the land at current market prices, paying in installments at low interest rates. A farmowner who lost land in the redistribution process was to receive land having the same value as his former holding. The land consolidation program also involved the construction of a service road network to connect all plots to larger roads.
By the end of 1988, twenty-eight land consolidation projects had been completed, and thirty-one projects were underway. Where projects had been completed, minute plots were almost completely eliminated, the average size of plots increased by 100 percent, and the number of plots declined by about 70 percent.
Agricultural cooperatives.
The agricultural cooperative movement in Cyprus was founded in 1909 by a village society of farmers who had returned from an inspection tour of Britain and Germany.
The cooperative movement's development was slow, largely because few villagers were qualified to manage cooperatives. The Agricultural Bank, established in 1925 to furnish medium and long-term loans to farmers, functioned through the cooperative societies. In 1937 a new impetus was given to the movement by the establishment of the Cooperative Central Bank (CCB), with membership limited to the cooperative societies.
The bank's initial function was to furnish the societies with funds for short-term loans to members. This function was expanded in 1960 (when the CCB absorbed the Agricultural Bank) to include medium- and long-term loans. By the late 1980s, the CCB was the third largest bank in the government-controlled area in terms of deposits. The cooperative movement's banking activity was especially strong in the countryside, but also competed with conventional banks in urban areas and had about a 30 percent share of the banking business as a whole.
In addition to banking and credit activities, the cooperative movement maintained retail stores. Cooperatives also marketed agricultural products and exported large amounts of citrus fruits, other fruits, table grapes, and vegetables. The largest winery on the island was the Cooperative Winery SODAP Ltd.
Crops.
Crop production was by far the most important component of agriculture. In 1988 it contributed 71 percent of total value added in agriculture, compared with 19 percent for livestock. Ancillary production contributed 6 percent; the shares of fishing and forestry were 3 and 1 percent, respectively.
A wide range of crops were grown on Cyprus. Cereals (wheat and barley), legumes, vegetables (carrots, potatoes, and tomatoes), fruit and other tree crops (almonds, apples, bananas, carobs, grapes, grapefruit, lemons, melons, olives, oranges, and peaches).
Crops were rainfed or irrigated. Wheat and barley were rainfed or dryland crops, as were carobs, olives, fodder, and wine grapes. Crops that required irrigation included vegetables, citrus fruits, deciduous fruits, bananas, and table grapes. These irrigated crops accounted for half of agricultural production.
Cereals, mainly wheat and barley, grew mostly on the Mesaoria, the island's central plain. Production fluctuated widely, depending on rainfall. Wheat's importance relative to barley declined steadily during the 1980s, the result of greater subsidies paid for the raising of barley.
Despite the subsidies and a doubling of barley production, only part of the domestic need for cereals was met, and substantial imports were necessary.
Market vegetables grew in many areas around the island. The potato was the most important of these crops, far outstripping tomatoes, carrots, water and sweet melons, cucumbers, and others in both weight and value. In fact, the potato was the most important agricultural product in the late 1980s, during which more than 80 percent of its production was exported. In 1987 the potato earned 10 percent of the total value of domestic exports, more than any other item except clothing. Because the Cypriot potato was harvested twice, in winter and in early spring, it had a competitive advantage in the European market. Britain was the largest consumer. A shortage of suitable land and a need for irrigation meant that the potato's importance for Cypriot agriculture declined in the 1990s, but it would remain one of the sector's main supports.
Citrus production was another irrigated crop that was important for exports; about 75 percent of production was consumed abroad. Groves of oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and tangerines were located along the coasts. Unlike potato production, that of citrus fruits was expected to expand greatly in the 1990s, and one estimate foresaw a yield of 350,000 tons by the turn of the century, compared with 169,000 tons in 1989.
Viniculture and the production of wine have been major economic activities for centuries in Cyprus. Most vineyards are located in the southwestern part of the island on the slopes of the Troodos Mountains in the Paphos district and in hilly areas in the Limassol district. Some grapes were grown for table consumption, but about four-fifths of the harvest was used for wine, two-thirds of it exported. In 1989 the grape harvest amounted to 212,000 tons, and wine production was 34.1 million liters.
The most commonly grown grapes were the Xynisteri and mavro varieties. Systematic efforts were undertaken by the government to improve the quality of Cypriot grapes, and different kinds of wine were manufactured to increase exports, mainly to Europe.
Deciduous tree crops common to temperate climates, including olives, apples, pears, peaches, carobs, and cherries, were also grown. These crops required some cool weather during the year, and the orchards were almost entirely in mountainous areas. Almond trees, which do not need cool weather, were widespread on the plains. Olives were easily the most important export item of these tree crops.
Livestock and poultry.
Livestock products, including poultry and milk, made up a significant part of the gross output by value of the agricultural sector. In 1989 there were 49,000 cattle, 325,000 sheep, 208,000 goats, 281,000 pigs, and 2,475,000 chickens in the government-controlled area. During the 1980s, livestock production roughly doubled, as a result of subsidies, strict import regulations, and government-sponsored research that improved both the quality of livestock and its management. Although Greek Cypriots had become self-sufficient with regard to pork and poultry, it was necessary to import beef, veal, and mutton to meet domestic needs. Specialists believed that the gradual lifting of import restrictions, as required by the EEC Customs Union Agreement, would put many inefficient breeders of livestock out of business.
Fishing and forestry.
Fishing has been of small importance to Cyprus throughout history. The intermittent nature of the rivers inhibits natural propagation of freshwater fish, and the surrounding waters are generally deficient in the nutrients and associated plankton essential to the growth of a large marine fish population.
The Turkish invasion resulted in the loss of some of the better fishing areas. By the second half of the 1980s, loans and subsidies from the Department of Fisheries had secured the existence of a fishing fleet of several hundred small vessels, and annual catches exceeded those preceding 1974. In 1989 the catch totaled 2,600 tons at live weight.
The 1980s also saw saltwater and freshwater fish farms come into operation. Much of their production was exported. An experimental fish farm was scheduled to open in the 1990s at Meneou, near Larnaca.
Forestry played a very small role in the Greek Cypriot economy. In the period 1986-1988, its value added was 0.01 percent of the agricultural total in all three years.
Nearly all of the south's forests were owned by the state, which had long managed an active and sophisticated program for their care and improvement. The Turkish invasion of 1974 damaged the island's forests extensively, but by the 1980s reforestation projects had repaired much of the harm. The College of Forestry, established by the British in the colonial period, enjoyed an international reputation for excellence.

He began it in 1798, painting its subject from life, and it was to represent Bonaparte at the Battle of Rivoli, holding the Treaty of Campo Formio in his hand, but it was never completed. Vivant Denon cut down the canvas to preserve only the painted part of the face and bust. It is on display at the Louvre.

Gas protection

Gas protection is a technical solution to prevent or to control gas penetration into properties. The control of gas migration is normally achieved by blocking the pathway or removing the source of the gas generation. There are several methods available to achieve the protection of existing / new build properties and also another factor is the use of the property and size (economic factors).
The main components that developer have to be aware of in the U.K are methane (which is flammable at 5% to 15% by volume in air) and carbon dioxide (which is toxic), after two gas explosions in the U.K. in the 1980s Loscoe and Abbeystead. Building Research Establishment, British Standards, the Department of Environment and other regulatory bodies including ones in construction industry developed and published guidance for preventing gas ingress into building of these two gases in the UK. Their production in the environment are associated with coal seams, deposited river silt, sewage, landfill, and peat.
In the case of landfill gas migration, the gas is produced by the organic materials in the waste degrading over time. Creating varying concentration over time ( typically 40% by volume and methane () typically 60% by volume), as previously explained this gas can be heaver than air or lighter depending on the concentrations of these gases and air, but will move from an area of high pressure to one at a lower pressure irrespective of its relative density. 
To try to prevent landfill gas migration from the site the operator should employ such methods as leachate drains with venting, low permeability geomembranes, slurry trenches, and grout curtains around the landfill site.
New buildings on contaminated land.
The development of buildings on contaminated land will require a barrier created either vertically in the instance of homes with basements or horizontally under the base of the house. This can be by means of generally a passive barrier but can sometimes be an active system.
Passive system.
This system will utilise a barrier with low permeability either via a synthetic membrane or a natural/engineered clay material. 
The effectiveness of these barriers are greatly affected by the installation methods and the integrity of the barrier being used. It must installed so it conforms to building regulations and quality assurance standards with guidance from BRE414.
The gas membrane can be put over the over a suspended beam and block floor and covered with a screed the area below being vented by airbricks or can be laid over a venting layer (200mm of granular material or 25mm of voidformer /a geocomposite)
Any penetration requiring passage thought the barrier will need to be sealed. This system will prevent entry of gases into the property and will be combined with an adequate venting system to allow dispersal of the gases to prevent any buildup around or under the property.
Note in the photo two types of heat gun that weld the material together or else material can be connected by using double sided butyl tape. The layer also extends over the exterior brick work.
Passive systems should have an integrity test to ensure the safety of the work. A test gas mixed with air is released under the membrane via a special tool. The entire area is then checked by operators using special air sensors to see if there are any leaks. If the work passes then it should be issued with a certificate of integrity.
Active systems.
Due to the cost implications and the requirement for management and control this type of protection is mainly used on commercial properties.
There are two main practical types of Active systems to prevent the ingress of gases into buildings:
There should be alarms for both systems in the event of power failure to the systems as this will lead to an eventual buildup of gases to a dangerous level. These systems should be assessed by a third party to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the system.
Building near landfill sites.
The issue with developing housing around such site is compounded by such issues as the stack effect, that is warm indoor air being less dense than the exterior cold air and so creating an area of lower pressure inside a property, which will encourage the ingress of gas. This gas can concentrate in any subfloor void (i.e. basements or gaps created below the floor slab due to settlement) or even in cupboards. It can also enter the building in any gaps left in the construction of the property or created during settlement. 
"Waste management Paper 27" from the U.K. Department of the Environment recommends consultation with the relevant local authority if any proposed development is to be less than 250m from the site boundary that has received waste in the last 30 years. 
The 250 m is not a definitive insomuch as landfill gas will not be present outside or conversely present within this distance, due to the varied factors contributing to landfill gas migration. Due to this fact there should always be a thorough site investigation if a development is taking place within the 250 m zone or if there is a suspicion of any hazardous gas being present.
Integrity testing.
Both systems should have/require 'Gas integrity testing'. 
The NHBC traffic light system (a method of gauging require protection need from results form the site investigation - the higher the risk the more points required in terms of protection to allow domestic construction) will offer a score of 2 points for a foil backed gas membrane installed with integrity testing where an untested gas membrane might result in 0.5 points. 
This is both due to the conditions under which gas membranes are installed are often difficult and can adversely compromise the integrity required by the manufacturer/client. The purpose of the test to ensure this integrity to allow the installation to be certified as the method of protection performs correctly.
Gas membrane testing.
The test is carried out on the membrane immediately after its installation and prior to it being covered up by the following construction processes. The area below the membrane is temporarily pressurised with a mixture of clean air and a specialist nontoxic and inert tracer gas that is extreme sensitivity to detection. Specialist equipment is then used to trace all leaks within the installation with particular attention being paid to the critical points and junctions formed between the membrane material and other structural elements prior to conducting a detailed sweep of the complete area (see construction principles). Any leaks are identified, sealed and re-tested before the membrane is passed and then the Certificate can be issued.
Active systems.
Require a test of the alarm in case of failure of the system/power supply and possible dangerous buildup of gas.

David Reichenberg

David Reichenberg (13 July 1950 - 10 June 1987) was an American oboist and a highly respected specialist on the baroque oboe. He was born in Cedar Falls, Iowa and learnt the flute, violin and piano as a child. He began his oboe studies with Dr Myron E. Russell of the University of Northern Iowa. Beginning in 1969, Reichenberg studied at the Indiana University School of Music, continuing his oboe studies with Jerry Sirucek, former oboist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Graduating in 1972, Reichenberg moved to Salzburg, where he attended the Mozarteum. It was in Salzburg that Reichenberg met Nikolaus Harnoncourt, director of Concentus Musicus Wien. Reichenberg became increasingly interested in playing the oboe's repertoire on the instrument for which it had been written and, with the assistance of Harnoncourt, moved to Vienna in order to study baroque oboe with Jürg Schäftlein. He simultaneously studied oboe making with Paul Hailperin, building the instrument upon which he played for four years. Reichenberg took part in many concerts and recordings with Concentus Musicus, and gradually increased his activities with that group.
In 1977, Reichenberg formed the Munich-based orchestra, Florilegium Musicum, which gave numerous performances of Bach cantatas and Mozart masses. During that year, Reichenberg received several requests to play in England. Most notable among these was the offer to participate in the Deutsche Grammophon/Archiv recordings of the Bach Orchestral Suites with the English Concert, directed by Trevor Pinnock. At the close of the year, Reichenberg toured the United States with the Concentus Musicus and thereafter moved to England.
In London, Reichenberg was immediately in demand as a freelance player with all the orchestras playing on period instruments. These included the Taverner Consort, the London Classical Players, London Baroque, the English Bach Festival, the Academy of Ancient Music, the English Baroque Soloists, as well as the English Concert. Reichenberg appeared extensively as soloist with the English Concert, and toured the United States, Japan, Germany, Austria, France and Italy with this group. His many recordings with the English Concert (Deutsche Grammophon/Archiv) include Bach's oboe d'amore concerto, as well as the double concerto for oboe and violin, all the Brandenburg concerti, the Handel oboe concerti, the Handel Concerti grossi Opus 3, Vivaldi's Oboe concerto in A minor, plus the G major double concerto for oboe and bassoon. Among his other solo recordings, Reichenberg has recorded the Handel oboe sonatas with l'Ecole d'Orphee, available on the CRD label.
Following Reichenberg's arrival in London in 1978, he served as instructor of baroque oboe at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He also taught each summer from 1981 through 1986 at the Summer Academy held in Palicio de Mateus in northern Portugal. Reichenberg was appointed Professor of Baroque Oboe at the Vienna Hochschule in 1986.
He died of complications from AIDS in 1987. (Material taken from a memorial tribute by Nora Post in "The Double Reed," Vol. 11, No. 1)

Bernhard Krause

Bernhard Krause (11 May 1910 – 19 February 1945) was an Obersturmbannführer (Lieutenant Colonel) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, which was awarded to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership by Nazi Germany during World War II.
Early life.
Bernhard Krause was born on the 11 May 1910, in Weimar, Germany. After completing his schooling he volunteered to join the SS-VT in January 1934, and posted to the SS Standarte "Deutschland". In 1935 he was selected to become an officer and sent to the SS-Junkerschule at Bad Tölz. Upon graduation he was promoted to Untersturmführer (Second Lieutenant) in April and further promoted to Obersturmführer (First Lieutenant) in April 1936. He was given command of the 5th Company, Leibstandarte SS "Adolf Hitler" and promoted to Hauptsturmführer (Captain) in January 1939.

World War II.
Krause took part in the early campaigns of the war the Polish Campaign and the Battle of France. He was awarded his first combat decoration, the Iron Cross II class, in April 1941, during Operation Marita the invasion of the Balkans. He next took part in Operation Barbarossa the invasion of the Soviet Union and was awarded the Iron Cross I class in August followed by the Eastern Front Medal for service on the Eastern Front during the first Russian winter of the war in 1942.
Krause was given command of the I. Battalion, 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment "LSSAH" in 1943 and then the 1st SS Flak Battalion, "LSSAH", and fought in the Battle of Kharkov in command of the Flak Battalion where the battalions attacks were of crucial importance.
Krause was then transferred to the newly formed SS division 12th SS Panzer Division "Hitlerjugend" in July 1943, and given command of the I. Battalion, 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment.
This new Division's first combat was in the Battle of Normandy in June 1944, and the defence of Caen the Battalion held their position for 17 days, particularly on the 24 June in the area of Saint Manvieu being attacked on both flanks they were able to hold out until withdrawn to new positions. For his bravery and leadership during this time he was awarded the German Cross in Gold.
Knight's Cross.
Krause was awarded the Knight's Cross for his actions in August 1944, in the sector along the Caen to Falaise road. The Allies had broken through the lines in the area of the 89th Infantry Division on the 13 August. Krause had command of a Kampfgruppe and was positioned on both sides of the road to Soulangy with orders to prevent a breakthrough to Falaise.
On the 14 August they held out against repeated attacks and were ordered to withdraw to a new position just outside Falaise on the 16 August and secure the road junction one kilometer north of the town. They held this new position against strong attacks from the north, west and southwest, destroying seven tanks and numerous infantry carriers. Suffering heavy losses, the battalion was relocated into Falaise beside the cathedral and the barracks. When they were ordered to pull out, the Battalion consisted of the strength of a weak Company.
Krause was then given command of the 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, 12th SS Panzer Division "Hitlerjugend". He did not survive the war, but was killed in action on 19 February 1945.

Sima Milutinović Sarajlija

Simeon "Sima" Milutinović "Sarajlija" (, ) (1791–1847) was a Serbian and Montenegrin poet, hajduk, translator, historian, philologist, diplomat and adventurer.
From his birth his life was a constant adventure. It began with his family's flight from the plague and the Turks. Its zenith came during the Serbian insurrections, and it ended in the unmatched glory of a poet and his grandiose political plans. 
Life and work.
Sima Milutinović was born in Sarajevo, Ottoman Empire in 1791, hence his nickname Sarajlija ("The Sarajevan"). His father was from the village of Rožanstvo near Užice, which he left running away from the plague and eventually settled in Sarajevo long enough to marry a famed town beauty Anđelija Srdanović who is Sima's mother. 
Sima wasn't even two years of age when another plague outbreak hit Sarajevo. The family fled the town, seeking refuge on several locations in Bosnia, before going to Slavonski Brod, before ending up in Zemun where Sima commenced primary education but never completed it. He then attended school in Szeged (Hungary) and was later expelled from gymnasium in Sremski Karlovci.
During the First Serbian Uprising he was a scribe in Karađorđe's Governing Council (Praviteljstvujušći Sovjet). Sarajlija laid Dositej Obradović to rest and joined a guerilla band, commanded by hajduk Zeka Buljubaša. It was in the heat of battles with Ottoman Turks that his first poems germinated. They were not revolutionary odes, however, but love songs. They were inspired by his first great love - Fatima, a Turkish girl. After the collapse of the First Serbian Uprising he was a hajduk and teacher in Vidin. He also spent a year or two in a Turkish dungeon. After evading the Turks, he went to Chişinău (then part of Russia), where he remained, long enough to write "The Serbian Maid". It is said that he sent reports to confidants of Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia concerning Karađorđe's followers in exile. This did not keep him later from turning against the Obrenović faction. In 1825 he went to Germany where he enrolled in the University of Leipzig, though he did not tarry there. Instead, a year later, he went back to Serbia to be a clerk in the employ of Prince Miloš but on arriving in Zemun, however, he turned about and went to Trieste, Kotor, and then Cetinje.
He arrived in Cetinje on 25 September 1827, uninvited, led by the passions of adventure and poetry and, at the same time, deep patriotism. He was neither the first nor the last stranger to be attracted by the blazing heroism and hidden power of Montenegro. A gifted adventurer—Stephen the Small—had once wandered into this land from out of nowhere, and organized the first civil government. There was something of the adventurer in the Petrović bishops as well—in every one of them, in one way or another. Sarajlija simply blew into the Montenegro wilderness, fleeing before the Kotor police because of the
irregularity of his documents. He was to captivate Bishop Petar I Petrović Njegoš from the beginning. "As soon as I laid eyes on him, he came to my heart", the old man wrote to Jeremija Gagić, the Russian vice-consul at Dubrovnik, and added, "I do not know whether any other Serb would be willing to live in Montenegro." Sarajlija found Rade (the Bishop's nephew and the future Petar II Petrović Njegoš) there when he arrived. 
The Bishop immediately took him in as a secretary. Sima pushed himself forward and grasped for power. He was not only sent, but he went himself among the tribes to dispense justice and settle disputes. He took upon himself the education of Bishop's nephew Rade. Then suddenly something came into his head and he disappeared into the mountains, shut himself up in a hut, and after several days returned with the tragedy "Obilić".
He already had been everywhere, had experienced everything, had seen many different forms of government—including those born of revolution and arising from the most primitive conditions. He was nurtured in rebellions and prisons, in political strife, intrigue, and espionage, and, being himself unstable, unpredictable, he was accustomed to quick upheavals. Bishop Petar was to have many trials and tribulations with him. Sima got the old man to sign unread letters which brought the latter into conflict with Prince Miloš of Serbia. Miloš who recognized and had a regard for the genuine thing, was to pronounce a final judgement on Sima: "A young cloud-chaster whose nose scrapes the sky."
As soon as he arrived, Sarajlija began to think up schemes, to have ideas, to lay plans. How would it be, he proposed an alliance to Prince Miloš to attack the Turks? He was in the very eye of the Montenegrin storm which lay pent up in the stillness of the monastery waiting to break out at the death of the old Bishop.
Direct and provocative, Sarajlija hardly felt like a stranger. Nor was he regarded as such. It was as though his irrepresible nature had found refuge for the first time, in a land in which—as he himself said -- "every rifle is a cannon, every head anointed, every wish the general will, every home a castle, and every cliff a fortress."
He was a handsome man with a mighty frame, and this is not without importance in Montenegro. That is what his painting (the excellent portrait done by Katarina Ivanoviċ) also portrays—masculine beauty, willfullness, energy. He already enjoyed the fame of a poet, and his life was stormy even for those times of rebellions and revolutions. In 1829 Bjelice tribe struggled against Ozirinići and Cuce, two neighboring tribes, and Petar I Petrović-Njegoš sent Sarajlija and Mojsije to negotiate peace among them.
Sarajlija remained in Cetinje more than three years—until the spring of 1831. But he still did not have enough of Montenegro. He was to come another three times—to be sure, on secret, inexplicable, and perhaps even invetented missions.
In 1836 he escorted Prince Miloš to Istanbul, only to find himself immediately thereafter in Prague, Vienna, and Budapest. He remained a while in Budapest and married there, in 1838, Marija Popović-Punktatorka (1810–1875), who was also a poet. (She carried on a lively correspondence with Vuk Karadžić, Milovan Vidaković, and Đorđe Marković Koder among many other men of letters, even before her marriage). In 1839 he was in Belgrade—deep in political intrigue. Again flight and wandering. In 1846 he led a group of Serbian students to St. Petersburg, where they were to study. He died suddenly in Belgrade at the end of 1847 at the height of his strength and vigor. He was mourned by all, as the greatest Serbian poet (of his day), even in distant Montenegro, where his erstwhile pupil, Njegoš, dedicated to his ashes an ode which was lavish and unstinting in love and appreciation. He was buried in the graveyard at St. Mark's Church.

Notas para una cartografía de Filipinas

Notas para una cartografía de Filipinas, subtitled "Prelude, Toccata, and Fugues for piano and gangsa, one player", is a work by the contemporary classical composer Jeffrey Ching (Chinese name in Pinyin: Zhuang Zŭxin 莊祖欣, 庄祖欣). It was completed in Berlin on 19 December 2007. The first performances were given by Kyoko Okuni in Münster on 30 September 2008 and by Abelardo Galang II in Osaka on 5 October 2008.
Origin of the title.
The Spanish title, meaning “Notes for a cartography of the Philippines”, was taken from this sentence in a scholarly journal:
Between 1903 and 1907 Blair and Robertson incorporated numerous photoengraved reproductions of early maps in their well-known corpus of Philippiniana (Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, "The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898", 55 vols. 1903-1907), and Robertson at the same time evaluated some of these maps as historical evidence, but the first attempt at a cartographical analysis was made by Pardo de Tavera in 1910 ("Notas para una cartografía de Filipinas", "Cultura Filipina", vol. I, no. 8 1910, pp. 101-176).
The present composition is also an “attempt at a cartographical analysis” of the Philippines, in that each of the archipelago's three main island groups—Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao—is distinctly represented. But the same learned article also discusses in considerable detail the cartographical contributions of the Philippines’ Asian neighbours:
…the first map to depict any part of the Philippine Islands, was the “Earth vehicle” ("Yü-t’u"), that is, a terrestrial map, which Chu Ssû-pen completed in 1320. … [The second map to depict the Philippines…exists only in the form of a copy made about a century after the original. I refer to the "Hun-I chiang-li li-tai kuo-tu chih-t’u" (Map of the territories of the one world and the capitals of the countries in successive ages) compiled in 1402 by Li Hui and Ch'üan Chin… The earliest map the Japanese map collection in the East Asiatic Library of the University of California…dates from about 1620, and depicts a deformed Luzon under the rubric Ruson. … The collection also contains a map ("Nantan Bushū Bankoku Shōka no Zu") belonging to the East Asian tradition of Buddhist cartography, which is dated to 1710, although based on an exemplar of 1688. …ts plethora of rubrics include elements from virtually all the traditions of Chinese topographical writing… 
Brief description.
The piece lasts between fifteen and twenty minutes, and opens with a prelude suffused with misty echoes of Sino-Japanese imperial court music, in the form of a Chinese melody of the Tang Dynasty, “Music of Universal Peace”. It is notated wholly without bar lines, so that its poetic “timelessness” is also literal. The traditional harmonies of the Japanese mouth-organ (shō) are quoted, and gagaku drums of different sizes evoked through various percussive effects (palm and fingernail taps and tremolos) on the wooden casing of the piano.
A highly rhythmic toccata follows, polyphonically adapting within its pentatonic confines a kudyapi (boat lute) piece from the province of Maguindanao in Mindanao (the southern-most Philippine island group). Then a rather Hispanic lullaby from the Visayas (the central island group) is expanded into a very European chromatic fughetta. The two geographical areas unite in a double fugue for the concluding "allegro tempo primo", embracing the remaining region of Luzon (the northern-most island group) only upon the entry of the gangsa, the flat lap-gong of the Kalingga and Tinggian tribes. The fugue is interrupted six times towards its close, accelerating twice after two interruptions by the gangsa. After a seventh interruption (which gives the pianist the opportunity to position the gangsa over the piano's lowest strings), a majestic restatement of the Visayan lullaby theme gradually subsides, bringing the whole work to a quiet close.
Critical notice.
Jeffrey Ching hatte für seine Notas ein kalligrafisches Notenbild zu bieten, dessen ornamentale Feinheit sich im Klang wider-spiegelte. Die Pianistin Okuni musste am Flügel klopfen, sich während des Spielens einen Gong umbinden lassen und parallel strapaziöse Ostinato-Figuren, komplexe Akkordarpeggien und blitzartige Dynamikwechsel bewältigen. Sie durchwanderte die Grafik des Notenbildes wie eine Landkarte.

Process lifecycle

Process Lifecycle is a manner of looking at processes, in the context of their initial, maturing and final stages of evolution and growth. Understanding and analyzing processes in this manner helps to understand how they fit into a "system" of processes as well as how they change as a process matures within an organization.
This manner of analysis is a companion to the systems thinking discipline that is defined as any process of estimating or inferring how local policies, actions, or changes influences the state of the neighboring universe. It is an approach to problem solving that views "problems" as parts of an overall system, rather than reacting to present outcomes or events and potentially contributing to further development of the undesired issue or problem.Systems thinking is a framework that is based on the belief that the component parts of a system can best be understood in the context of relationships with each other and with other systems, rather than in isolation. The only way to fully understand why a problem or element occurs and persists is to understand the part in relation to the whole.[2 Standing in contrast to Descartes's scientific reductionism and philosophical analysis, it proposes to view systems in a holistic manner. Consistent with systems philosophy, systems thinking concerns an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entirety of the system.

War of the Thuringian Succession

The War of the Thuringen Succession (German: "thüringisch-hessische Erbfolgekrieg") (1247–1264) was a military conflict over a successor to the last Landgrave of Thuringia in present-day Germany.
Source of the conflict.
With the death of the childless Landgrave Henry Raspe in 1247, the Ludowingian line of Thuringian landgraves became extinct in the male line. His property included not only large parts of Thuringia, but also the Countship of Hesse had come into Ludowingian possession through the female line. In 1122, before his acquisition of the title of Landgrave, Count Louis I of Thuringia had married Hedwig of Gudensberg, the female heir of the Hessian countly family of the Gisonen. The Gisonen, whose lands were initially mainly in the upper Lahn area, had previously come into the significant inheritance of Count Werner in Lower Hesse. Then, through the marriage of Giso IV with Kunigunde of Bilstein, they had also acquired widespread property and vogtship rights from the Counts of Bilstein.
Claims on the Ludowingians' inheritance were made by Henry Raspe's niece and his nephew. Sophie of Thuringia, married to Henry II, Duke of Brabant and Lothier, was the daughter of Henry Raspe's brother Louis IV and she claimed the territories on behalf of her son Henry. (Sophie's sister Gertrude was abbess of the imperial convent of Altenberg in Wetzlar and thus excluded from the succession.) Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, was the son of Henry Raspe's older sister Jutta. Another competitor was the Archbishop of Mainz, who could claim Hesse was a fiefdom of the Archbishopric and now, after the extinction of the Ludowingians, demanded its return.
Results of the war.
The war lasted over 17 years. Sophie did not succeed in winning the overall Ludowinger inheritance for her son Henry, but the war secured his Hessian possessions. This created the Landgraviate of Hesse. The Margrave of Meissen acquired Thuringia and also the title of Landgrave of Thuringia.
The importance of the dispute and its outcome lies in that an increasingly strong territorial principality of Hesse emerged and that, at the same time, the goal of the Ludowingians of building a strong territorial base in the heart of Germany through the combination of Hesse and Thuringia, came to an end. The Wettiners of the Margraviate of Meissen did subsequently achieve this goal. With the acquisition of the Electorate of Saxony in 1423, they gained a power center on the Elbe.

Tarski's high school algebra problem

In mathematical logic, Tarski's high school algebra problem was a question posed by Alfred Tarski. It asks whether there are identities involving addition, multiplication, and exponentiation over the positive integers that cannot be proved using eleven axioms about these operations that are taught in high school-level mathematics. The question was solved in 1980 by Alex Wilkie who showed that such unprovable identities do exist.
Statement of the problem.
Tarski considered the following eleven axioms about addition ('+'), multiplication ('·'), and exponentiation to be standard axioms taught in high school:
These eleven axioms, sometimes called the high school identities, are related to the axioms of an exponential ring. Tarski's problem then becomes: are there identities involving only addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, that are true for all positive integers, but that cannot be proved using only the axioms 1–11?
Example of a provable identity.
Since the axioms seem to list all the basic facts about the operations in question it is not immediately obvious that there should be anything one can state using only the three operations that is not provably true. However, proving seemingly innocuous statements can require long proofs using only the above eleven axioms. Consider the following proof that ("x" + 1)2 = "x"2 + 2 · "x" + 1:
Here brackets are omitted when axiom 2. tells us that there is no confusion about grouping.
The length of proofs is not an issue; proofs of similar identities to that above for things like ("x" + "y")100 would take a lot of lines, but would really involve little more than the above proof.
History of the problem.
The list of eleven axioms can be found explicitly written down in the works of Richard Dedekind, although they were obviously known and used by mathematicians long before then. Dedekind was the first, though, who seemed to be asking if these axioms were somehow sufficient to tell us everything we could want to know about the integers. The question was put on a firm footing as a problem in logic and model theory sometime in the 1960s by Alfred Tarski, and by the 1980s it had become known as Tarski's high school algebra problem.
Solution.
In 1980 Alex Wilkie proved that not every identity in question can be proved using the axioms above. He did this by explicitly finding such an identity. By introducing new function symbols corresponding to polynomials that map positive numbers to positive numbers he proved this identity, and showed that these functions together with the eleven axioms above were both sufficient and necessary to prove it. The identity in question is
This identity is usually denoted "W"("x","y") and is true for all positive integers "x" and "y", as can be seen by factoring formula_2 out of the second terms; yet it cannot be proved true using the eleven high school axioms.
Intuitively, the identity cannot be proved because the high school axioms can't be used to discuss the polynomial formula_3. Reasoning about that polynomial and the subterm formula_4 requires a concept of negation or subtraction, and these are not present in the high school axioms. Lacking this, it is then impossible to use the axioms to manipulate the polynomial and prove true properties about it. Wilkie's results from his paper show, in more formal language, that the "only gap" in the high school axioms is the inability to manipulate polynomials with negative coefficients.
Generalisations.
Wilkie proved that there are statements about the positive integers that cannot be proved using the eleven axioms above and showed what extra information is needed before such statements can be proved. Using Nevanlinna theory it has also been proved that if one restricts the kinds of exponential one takes then the above eleven axioms are sufficient to prove every true statement.
Another problem stemming from Wilkie's result that remains open is that which asks what the smallest algebra is for which "W"("x", "y") is not true but the eleven axioms above are. In 1985 an algebra with 59 elements was found that satisfied the axioms but for which "W"("x", "y") was false. Smaller such algebras have since been found, and it is now known that the smallest such one must have either 11 or 12 elements.

Bourbon Claim to the Spanish Throne

After the death of the last Habsburg monarch of Spain in 1700, the degenerate Charles II, the Spanish throne was up for grabs between the various powers of Europe, despite Charles having left a will, naming his heir. In this will, Charles left Philip, Duke of Anjou, grandson of the French king, the Kingdom of Spain and the Spanish possessions in the New World.
The Austrian Habsburgs, who considered themselves the rightful heirs of Charles, formed a coalition against France and Spain with the rest of Europe, fearing the Spanish throne and the vast Spanish empire passing into effective French control, therefore starting the War of the Spanish Succession. In this article, the Bourbon claim to the Spanish throne and its origins are explained in detail.
Early French-Spanish relations.
Counts of Barcelona.
France and Spain had had earlier connections, although the latter was not yet a country in its true sense. Some dynasties that ruled in Spain had French origins – for example, the rulers of the County of Barcelona (created by Charlemagne when he conquered lands north of river Ebro, subservient to the Carolingian rulers of France until they declared independence after the gradual decline of Carolingian authority), had French Provençal blood in their ancestry (the Counts of Barcelona also held the title of "Count of Provence").
In the 11th century, the Counts of Barcelona formed a dynastic union with the Kingdom of Aragon, hence Alfonso II of Aragon was the first Count of Barcelona to be crowned King of Aragon, succeeding his mother Petronila of Aragon. Moreover, Alfonso's maternal grandparents were the Duke and Duchess of Aquitaine, making Alfonso a first cousin once removed of the famous French, later English, Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine.
Kingdom of Navarre.
The Íñiguez dynasty founded by Íñigo Arista, founded the Navarrese kingdom (of Pamplona) in or around 824 when they rebelled against nominal Carolingian authority. In 905, a coalition of neighbors forced Fortún Garcés, a grandson of Íñigo Arista, to retire to a monastery, and enthroned in his place a scion of a new dynasty, under which, the name Navarre began to supplant that of Pamplona. With the assassination of Sancho IV, the last king of the aforementioned dynasty, Navarre was invaded by his cousins Alfonso VI of Castile and Sancho Ramirez of Aragon, and the latter made king, leading to a half-century of Aragonese control.
The death of Alfonso led to a succession crisis in Aragon, and the nobles of Navarre took advantage to reestablish an independent monarchy, crowning a grandnephew (through an illegitimate brother) of the assassinated Sancho IV. The death of Sancho VII, the last of the Jimenez kings, led to the crown of Navarre being inherited by the son of his sisterBlanca, Countess of Champagne, she having been regent during much of her brother's reign. Therefore her son Theobald, was the first Frenchman to rule Navarre. Through his granddaughter Joan, Queen consort of France, Navarre passed into the control of the House of Capet, succeeded by several Capetian and non-Capetian dynasties.
In accordance to the French law of succession, Henri III of Navarre, succeeded as King of France in 1589. Every succeeding monarch in France assumed the double title of King of France and Navarre. However, by the time Henry became King of Navarre, much of it had been overrun by Aragon. In 1512, John III of Navarre, of the House of Albret, was defeated by Ferdinand II of Aragon, who then conquered southern Navarre for the Crown of Aragon and was crowned king. The monarchs of Navarre after 1512 (including Henri) thus only reigned over Lower Navarre, the part of Navarre north of the Pyrenees. On a whole, the early French-Spanish relations can be described as turbulent and uneasy.
Spanish Brides.
The first legitimate connection with Spain came with the marriage of Infanta Ana of Spain to Louis XIII. The Infanta was the daughter of Philip III of Spain. As Spanish succession laws did not prevent a female from ascending the throne, she was the heiress presumptive to the throne. Likewise, her offspring would have a legitimate, if not strong, claim to the Spanish throne. Thus, before her marriage, she was made to renounce all succession rights she had had for herself and her descendants by Louis.
Further cementing Habsburg-Bourbon relations, Philip married Elisabeth, a sister of Louis XIII. This marriage produced the desired male heir and also Maria Theresa, who was the second link between France and Spain.
Born as Archduchess María Teresa of Austria, Infanta of Spain at the Royal Monastery of El Escorial, María Teresa thus combined the blood of Philip III of Spain and Margarita of Austria, on her father's side, and that of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici, on her mother's side. In his turn, Philip III was the son of Philip II of Spain and Anna of Austria who was, herself, a daughter of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria of Spain. Philip II and Maria of Spain were siblings, being both children of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Isabella of Portugal. María Teresa, therefore, like many Habsburgs, was a product of years and generations of royal intermarriage between cousins.
In 1659, as the war with France began to wind down, a union between the two royal families, of Spain and of France, was proposed as a means to secure peace. María Teresa and the French king were double first-cousins, and it was proposed that they wed. His father was Louis XIII of France, who was the brother of her mother, while her father was brother to Anne of Austria, his mother.
Such a prospect was intensely enticing to Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV and aunt of María Teresa, who desired an end to hostilities between her native country, Spain, and her adopted one, France, and who hoped this to come by her niece becoming her daughter-in-law. However, Spanish hesitation and procrastination led to a scheme in which Cardinal Mazarin, the First Minister of France, pretended to seek a marriage for his master with Margaret of Savoy. When Philip IV of Spain heard of the meeting at Lyon between the Houses of France and Savoy, he reputedly exclaimed of the Franco-Savoyard union that "it cannot be, and will not be". Philip then sent a special envoy to the French Court to open negotiations for peace and a royal marriage.
The negotiations for the marriage contract were intense. Eager to prevent a union of the two countries or crowns, especially one in which Spain would be subservient to France, the diplomats sought to include a renunciation clause which would deprive María Teresa and her children of any rights to the Spanish succession. This was eventually done but, by the skill of Mazarin and his French diplomats, the renunciation and its validity were made conditional upon the payment of a large dowry. As it turned out, Spain, impoverished and bankrupt after decades of war, was unable to pay such a dowry, and France never received the agreed sum of 500,000 écus.
The Last of the Spanish Habsburgs.
The respective marriages of Anne of Austria and Maria Theresa into the French Royal Family would not be thought much of despite Spain's tradition of following cognatic primogeniture (it did not exclude females from reigning on the throne of Spain). The Habsburgs themselves had come into possession of Spain through a female line: Joanna of Castile, the last heir of the joint sovereigns Isabella I of Castile and her husband Ferdinand II of Aragon, as her elder brother and the heir apparent had died childless.
Probably, (similar to what Philip V attempted to secure his dynasty's possession of Spain) the Habsburgs wanted to prevent the succession of any other royal house to the throne of Spain through a female line. Fortunately, each Habsburg king had a son to succeed him. Luck apparently ran out with the death of Baltazar Carlos, Philip IV's heir apparent.
Therefore, with her brother's death, as a birthright, María Teresa could inherit the vast Spanish Empire and all the wealth it offered, since there was no restriction in Spanish succession law to the accession of a queen regnant (unlike in France, with its famous Salic Law). Likewise, if María Teresa refused the throne, it would pass to the next blood descendants, the Austrian Habsburgs, who were also descended from a female line of the Spanish Habsburgs.
Desperate for a male heir and fearing the extinction of the dynasty, Philip married his late son's intended bride, his own niece, Mariana of Austria, the daughter of his sister Maria Anna of Spain (1606–46) and Emperor Ferdinand III.
The degree of inbreeding between the Spanish and Austrian branches of the House of Habsburg came to its zenith with this marriage and likewise, the resultant offspring was a culmination of nearly a century of incestuous marriages. This inbreeding in the Habsburg family genealogy had given many in the family hereditary weaknesses and left later generations prone to still-births. Charles's birth was greeted with joy and relief by the Spaniards, who had feared the dispute which could have ensued if Philip IV left no male heir. However, Charles was mentally and physically disabled as well as disfigured, which in turn limited his efficacy as a leader and earned him the name "El Hechizado" (""The Hexed"") in Spanish history.
Of Maria's six children, only one survived her, the Dauphin Louis, who died in 1711. Marie-Thérèse's grandson, Philip, Duke of Anjou, would eventually come to inherit her rights to the Spanish Throne, after the death of her mentally unstable half-brother Charles II of Spain. He acceded to that throne in 1700. It is through him that her descendants now reign over Spain. The War of the Spanish Succession was caused by this.
Philip of Anjou and the French Succession.
Philip of France, Duke of Anjou, was the second son of Louis, "le Grand Dauphin" and Maria Anna of Bavaria, known as "Dauphine Victoire", a younger brother of Louis, Duke of Burgundy and an uncle of Louis XV of France.
Philip was born at the Palace of Versailles in France. His older brother, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, was in line to the throne right after his father, "Le Grand Dauphin", thus leaving him and his younger brother, Charles, Duke of Berry little expectation to ever rule over France. However, his fortune (and that of his grandfather Louis XIV) started looking up when the degenerate last monarch of Spain, Charles II, fell ill. Both of Charles's marriages had failed to produce any offspring.
Charles II married Marie Louise of Orléans (1662–1689), eldest daughter of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, the only sibling of Louis XIV, and his first wife Princess Henrietta of England. It is likely that Charles was impotent, and no children were born. Marie Louise became deeply depressed and died at 26, ten years after their marriage, leaving 28-year-old Charles heartbroken. Still in desperate need of a male heir, the next year he married the 23-year-old Palatine princess Maria Anna of Neuburg, a daughter of Philip William, Elector of the Palatinate, and sister-in-law of his uncle Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. However, this marriage was no more successful than the first in producing the much-desired heir.
Having failed to produce the desired male heir, towards the end of his life, Charles became increasingly hypersensitive and strange, at one point demanding that the bodies of his family be exhumed so he could look upon the corpses. He reportedly wept upon viewing the body of his first wife, Marie Louise.
This spelled good news for his French relatives as they could now forward their dormant claims to the Spanish throne. Initially, Louis XIV wished to further his own ambitions by placing himself on the throne and gaining control of the vast Spanish empire, using his claim as heir to the Spanish throne, through his mother, daughter of Philip III. Among all the contenders, it was Louis XIV's son, Louis the Grand Dauphin, who was the closest heir, as the son of the oldest sister of Charles II.
So when Charles II died in 1700, the line of the Spanish Habsburgs died with him. Charles' last will and testament named the 16-year old Philip, Duke of Anjou, second son of the Grand Dauphin, as his successor. Upon any possible refusal the Crown of Spain would be offered next to Philip's younger brother Charles, Duke of Berry, or, next, to Archduke Charles of Austria, Charles's cousin from the Austrian branch of the Habsburg dynasty
Both claimants had a legal right due to the fact that Philip's grandfather, King Louis XIV of France and Charles's father, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold, were both the husbands of Charles' older half sisters and sons of Charles' aunts.
Philip had the better claim because his grandmother and great-grandmother were older than Leopold's. However, the Austrian branch claimed that Philip's grandmother had renounced the Spanish throne for her descendants as part of her marriage contract. This was countered by the French branch's claim that it was on the basis of a dowry that had never been paid.
After a long council meeting where the Dauphin spoke up in favour of his son's rights, it was agreed that Philip would ascend the throne but would forever renounce his claim to the throne of France for himself and his descendants.
However, the spectre of the multi-continental empire of Spain passing under the effective control of Louis XIV provoked a massive coalition of powers to oppose the Duke of Anjou's succession.
War of Spanish Succession.
The actions of Louis heightened the fears of the English, the Dutch and the Austrians, among others. In February 1701, the French king caused the "Parlement of Paris" (a court) to register a decree that should Louis himself have no heir, the Duke of Anjou — Philip V of Spain — would surrender the Spanish throne for that of the French, ensuring dynastic continuity in Europe's greatest land power.
However, a second act of the French king "justified a hostile interpretation": pursuant to a treaty with Spain, Louis occupied several towns in the Spanish Netherlands (modern Belgium and Nord-Pas-de-Calais). This was the spark that ignited the powder keg created by the unresolved issues of the War of the League of Augsburg (1689–97) and the acceptance of the Spanish inheritance by Louis XIV for his grandson.
Louis' position in the "Conseil d'en haut" gave him an opportunity to have his voice heard in the years and crises leading up to the War of the Spanish Succession. From his mother, Louis had rights and claims to the Spanish throne. His uncle Charles II of Spain had produced no descendants and, as he lay dying, had no heir to whom he could pass the throne. The choice of a successor was essentially split between the French and Austrian claimants. In order to improve the chances of a Bourbon succession, Louis gave up his rights in favour of his second son, Philip, Duke of Anjou, who, as second son, was not expected to succeed to the French throne, thus keeping France and Spain separate. Moreover, in the discussions in the "Conseil d'en haut" regarding the French response to Charles II's last will and testament, which did indeed leave all Spanish possessions to Anjou, Louis persuasively argued for acceptance. He opposed those who advocated a rejection of the will and the adherence to the Partition Treaty signed with William III of England, even though that treaty had awarded Naples, Sicily and Tuscany to him.
The War of the Spanish Succession (1702–1713) began. After eleven years of bloody, global warfare, fought on four continents and three oceans, the Duke of Anjou, as Philip V, was confirmed as King of Spain on substantially the same terms that the powers of Europe had agreed to before the war. Thus the Treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt ended the war and ""achieved little more than...diplomacy might have peacefully achieved in 1701"." A proviso of the peace perpetually forbade the union of the Spanish and French thrones.
The House of Bourbon, founded by Philip V, has intermittently occupied the Spanish throne ever since, and sits today on the throne of Spain in the person of Juan Carlos I of Spain (1975–2014). On 2 June 2014, Juan Carlos announced that he would abdicate in favour of his son, Felipe on 19 June 2014. He and his wife will retain their titles.

Interculturality

The term interculturality refers to any aspect of any interaction between any cultures.
Description.
A culture is understood as a group of people with a common identity that is based on common attributes, attitudes, practices and so on (such as a community of practice). Culture can include language, ways of thinking, ways of life, institutions, laws, rules of etiquette, sexual practices, material objects. When two groups meet whose cultures differ significantly in any respect, interculturality becomes an issue.
Interculturality is becoming increasingly important in the modern world as more and more people migrate from one country to another to escape from conflict, persecution or poverty, or to reunite families. Interculturality is often problematic, because racism and xenophobia are widespread and locals and migrants often compete for limited resources or employment opportunities. But interculturality also has benefits, including cultural enrichment and creativity.
On a local scale, United Cities and Local Governments includes interculturality as one of the basic principles of the Agenda 21 for culture, the first document of world scope that establishes the foundations for a commitment by cities and local governments to cultural development.
Interculturality is also defined by the Ariticle 2 of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions.

Time of concentration

Time of concentration is a concept used in hydrology to measure the response of a watershed to a rain event. It is defined as the time needed for water to flow from the most remote point in a watershed to the watershed outlet. It is a function of the topography, geology, and land use within the watershed.
Time of concentration is useful in predicting flow rates that would result from hypothetical storms, which are based on statistically derived return periods. For many (often economic) reasons, it is important for engineers and hydrologists to be able to accurately predict the response of a watershed to a given rain event. This can be important for infrastructure development (design of bridges, culverts, etc.) and management, as well as to assess flood risk such as the ARkStorm-scenario.
Example.
This image shows the basic principle which leads to determination of the time of concentration. Much like a topographic map showing lines of equal elevation, a map with isolines can be constructed to show locations with the same travel time to the watershed outlet. In this simplified example, the watershed outlet is located at the bottom of the picture with a stream flowing through it. Moving up the map, we can say that rainfall which lands on all of the places along the first yellow line will reach the watershed outlet at exactly the same time. This is true for every yellow line, with each line further away from the outlet corresponding to a greater travel time for runoff traveling to the outlet.
Furthermore, as this image shows, the spatial representation of travel times can be transformed into a cumulative distribution plot detailing how travel times are distributed throughout the area of the watershed.

Kahn had funded visits by European scholars to Princeton since 1925, and the new lectures were announced as a continuation of the earlier ones.
In 1923, shortly after Otto Kahn's son had entered Princeton, the banker was approached by the art historian Charles Rufus Morey, described by architectural historian Neil Levine as the prime mover of the Department of Art and Archaeology. Kahn agreed in 1924 to donate $1,500 a year for two years to finance extended visits by European scholars to the university. This was later extended for a third year. 
The first of these scholars was the Russian classical scholar Michael Rostovtzeff, who had already settled in the United States in 1918, after the Russian revolution. His lectures were later published as "The Animal Style in South Russia and China". The second was the French byzantinist Gabriel Millet, who held the chair for Æsthetics and Art History at the Collège de France. The third was the British archaeologist and hittitologist John Garstang.
After Kahn had become a member of the Visiting Committee of the Department in 1927, he promised to continue supporting lectures there. These were to begin in 1928/29 and would run for five years. The donation was reported on the front page of the "New York Times", which quoted Professor Morey's statement that the money would be used for the "continuation of the special lectures in art, archaeology, architecture and criticism which were initiated two years ago with Mr. Kahn's help". The report described the intended plan for "a course of eight lectures on different subjects given each year by a distinguished authority in his own field, while special emphasis will be placed on the selection of subjects not included in the Princeton curriculum."
After considering Arthur Pillans Laurie, Eugénie Sellers Strong and Herbert Joseph Spinden, the Department settled on the Swedish art historian Johnny Roosval, professor at Stockholm University, as the first lecturer. Roosval's lectures on Swedish art, described by Levine as "apparently not very exciting", were published in 1932. According to Levine, Roosval had been asked to extend his lectures to the modern architecture of Sweden, an area outside the expertise of the Swedish scholar, who was known for his studies of medieval art.
For the second round of lectures, Morey originally invited the Dutch architect J.J.P. Oud, "a star in the rising pantheon of younger European architects". Morey had been influenced in this choice by an article on Oud by Henry-Russell Hitchcock in the magazine "The Arts" in February 1928. Oud accepted, although he would have preferred to hold his lectures later in the spring than was possible, but ultimately he had to cancel because of illness (one of his frequent periods of depression). After once again considering H. J. Spinden, Baldwin Smith, who was acting chair of the Department during Morey's absence in Europe, invited Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright had recently published a number of pieces on architectural theory, but had little to do at the time, and the recent Wall Street Crash had made it look unlikely that he would get any new commissions for the time being. Despite this, Levine suggests that Wright's reason for accepting the offer was not primarily financial, but rather the "prestige of the venue and the bully pulpit it would afford him". According to the original donation by Kahn, each series was to consist of eight lectures, but Wright proposed that he would instead hold six lectures and arrange an exhibition of his own recent work "illustrating the ideas and principles involved in the ‘course'". According to Levine, Wright's Kahn lectures gave him a new and important experience and even "opened a new career path" for the architect, who continued to lecture extensively at universities and other institutions for the next year. His exhibition toured America in 1930 and Europe for six months in 1931. Wright's lectures were originally published in 1931 in the Princeton monograph series for art and archaeology. They were reprinted in 1987, and a new edition, with an introduction by Harvard professor Neil Levine, was published in 2008. In a contemporary review of the first edition of Wright's lectures, the critic Catherine Bauer described the book as "the very best book on modern architecture that exists".
The next two series of lectures in the series were held in January 1931 by Herbert Joseph Spinden, the expert in pre-Columbian American archaeology who had already been considered twice before, and in the fall of 1931 by Edward Denison Ross, director of (what was still known as) the School of Oriental Studies of the University of London, who talked about Persian art. Neither of these were published. Ross's lectures were described by Baldwin Smith as "rather flat, as the Englishman thought he could chat along pleasantly on most anything to an American audience." For the fifth round of lectures, the Department invited the French architectural historian Marcel Aubert, but he had to cancel after a scheduling conflict appeared with his lectures at Yale. Morey suggested to Kahn that the remaining funds be given to a student in need. Because of the financial losses Kahn had sustained during the preceding years, he could not renew his gift. Otto Kahn died two years later.

Taking Sides (film)

Taking Sides (German title "Taking Sides - Der Fall Furtwängler") is a 2001 German-French-Austrian-British co-production directed by István Szabó and starring Harvey Keitel and Stellan Skarsgård. The story is set during the period of denazification investigations conducted in post-war Germany after the Second World War, and it is based on the real interrogations that took place between a U.S. Army investigator and the musical conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, who had been charged with serving the Nazi regime. It is based on the 1995 play of the same title by Ronald Harwood.
The film was shot on location in Germany with the dialogue in German and English, although in the version released in the US and the UK the dialogue is only in English.
Plot summary.
In Berlin at the end of World War II, Wilhelm Furtwängler (Stellan Skarsgård) is conducting Beethoven's 5th Symphony when yet another Allied bomb raid stops the performance. A minister in Hitler's government comes to Furtwängler's dressing room to advise him that he should go abroad, and escape the war. The film then jumps to some time after the Allied victory, and we see U.S. Army General Wallace (R. Lee Ermey) task Major Steve Arnold (Harvey Keitel) with "getting" Furtwängler at his denazification hearing: "Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany".
Arnold gets an office with Lt. David Wills (Moritz Bleibtreu), a German-American Jew, and Emmaline Straube (Birgit Minichmayr), daughter of an executed member of the German resistance. Arnold questions several musicians, many of whom know Emmaline's father and say that Furtwängler refused to give Hitler the Nazi salute.
Arnold begins interrogating Furtwängler, asking why he didn't leave Germany in 1933 like so many other musicians? Why he played for Hitler's birthday? Why he played at a Nazi rally? And why his recording of Anton Bruckner's 7th Symphony was used on the radio after Hitler's death? Arnold gets a second violinist to tell him about Furtwängler's womanizing and the conductor's professional jealousy of Herbert von Karajan.
In a sub plot, Arnold is assisted by a young Jewish lieutenant from the Big Red One. The young officer begins to have sympathy for the conductor as well as for the young German girl who works as a clerk in their office. This causes friction between Arnold and his job investigating former suspected Nazis.
In a voice-over, Arnold explains that Furtwängler was exonerated at the later hearings but boasts his questioning "winged" him. The film closes with actual footage of the real Furtwängler shaking hands with Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels after a concert. A close-up then shows the conductor surreptitiously wiping his hands with a cloth after touching the Nazi.
Historical basis.
Even though many prominent contemporary German artists left, Furtwängler did not leave Germany in 1933 after Adolf Hitler took power. He played at numerous concerts attended by Nazi officials. A recording of the Adagio of Bruckner's Seventh Symphony was even played after the announcement of the death of Hitler. In 1945, he eventually went to Switzerland after playing a concert in Vienna. These facts, compounded by circumstances of the denazification hearings, caused Furtwängler's case to be significantly delayed.
Furtwängler was specifically charged with supporting Nazism by remaining in Germany, performing at Nazi party functions and with making an anti-Semitic remark against the part-Jewish conductor Victor de Sabata. He was eventually cleared on all these counts.
Reception.
Roger Ebert found the movie "both interesting and unsatisfying. The Keitel performance is over the top, inviting us to side with Furtwängler simply because his interrogator is so vile. There are maddening lapses, as when Furtwängler's rescue of Jewish musicians is mentioned but never really made clear. But Skarsgård's performance is poignant; it has a kind of exhausted passivity, suggesting a man who once stood astride the world and now counts himself lucky to be insulted by the likes of Major Arnold."
Mick LaSalle of the "San Francisco Chronicle" finds that the movie's promise to provide a balanced argument "goes unrealized, and all we're left with is the spectacle of an idiot bullying a genius. Harvey Keitel's performance as the smug, self-satisfied major is terribly miscalculated, unless he intended for us to loathe the spectacle of a small, stupid man glorying in his sudden power. That's possible. Stellan Skarsgård plays Furtwängler with an air of exhaustion that seems a generous attempt to justify the script's weakness, that the conductor doesn't defend himself vigorously enough. Of the two men, it's the major who acts more like a Nazi."

Isolated hepatic perfusion

Isolated hepatic perfusion is a procedure in which a catheter is placed into the artery that provides blood to the liver; another catheter is placed into the vein that takes blood away from the liver. This temporarily separates the liver's blood supply from blood circulating throughout the rest of the body and allows high doses of anticancer drugs to be directed to the liver only.

Radiosensitizer

A radiosensitizer is a drug that makes tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.
One of the major limitations of radiotherapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in oxygen. Solid tumors can outgrow their blood supply, causing a low-oxygen state known as hypoxia. Oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer, increasing the effectiveness of a given dose of radiation by forming DNA-damaging free radicals. Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than those in a normal oxygen environment. Much research has been devoted to overcoming this problem including the use of high pressure oxygen tanks, blood substitutes that carry increased oxygen, hypoxic cell radiosensitizers such as misonidazole and metronidazole, and hypoxic cytotoxins, such as tirapazamine. A newer approach involves the use of an oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound to re-oxygenate hypoxic tumor tissue. One such compound, trans sodium crocetinate, is currently being tested in a multi-center clinical trial in 59 patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme.

Giovanni de Ciotta

Giovanni de Ciotta (1824–1903) was the first-born son of Lorenzo de Ciotta and Luisa de Adamich, daughter of the foremost Fiuman merchant and father of modernisation in Fiume Andrea Lodovico de Adamich. The family de Ciotta originated from Livorno where Giovanni served the Austrian army in quality of engineer. As an officer of the Austrian engineer corps, he fought in Italy in the 1848-49 campaigns and remained in the army until 1859. He arrived in Fiume in 1859 from Livorno, after having resigned from the Austrian army, reputedly for political reasons. In Fiume initially he lived as a landlord and commercial agent for his brother Lorenzo who runs a trading company in Livorno, but soon turned to engineering. Nevertheless, his personal life remains a mystery.
Giovanni de Ciotta will rapidly become the most influential political representative in the City, incarnating the policies of Ferenc Deák in Hungary. Initially, Ferenc Deák had few open supporters in Fiume, where Lajos Kossuth was preferred, given the agitation done by his local exponent Gaspare Matcovich but a faction led by Luigi Francovich gradually emerged and coalesced around Deák's program in the 1860s.
In 1869, as a fiuman citizen, Ciotta was elected member of Parliament in Budapest. In the same year he became the head of the "Associazione politica Club Deak" (a section of the Deák Circles that was to become the local branch of the Hungarian Liberal Party and as such the first modern party organisation in Fiume). 
Hungarian support proved to be crucial to the development of the port of Fiume and Ciotta was the key person in assuring it. From 1872 to 1896 (apart from a short interruption in 1884) he was the mayor of the city. Following the financial crisis of 1873, that culminated in 1875, the conservative liberal Deák Party had to face a crisis from which it survived only with a merger with the more numerous conservative Left Center of Kálmán Tisza. The “new” Liberal Party of Hungary, was to rule Hungary (and Fiume) from 1875 to 1890, marking the golden years of Ciotta, later known as the "Idyll".
Under his lead an impressive phase of expansion of the city started, marked by the completion of the railway Fiume - Budapest, the construction of the modern port and the initiation of modern industrial and commercial enterprises such as the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company "Adria", and the Whitehead Torpedo Works, where his contribution was crucial as he financed Robert Whitehead's efforts in producing a viable torpedo. In 1885 the sumptuous new theatre was finished modelled on that of Budapest and Vienna, costing him a political crisis in 1884 for the raising building costs. 
While on army service he met John Leard, another fiuman of English origins. Ciotta with Leard in 1889 pushed forward the "Piano regolatore" the comprehensive urbanisation plan for the city. The new plan laid down the plan for a modern commercial city, destroying most of the older buildings and roads and introducing the regular planning as it was done in Budapest and other cites of the time. In 1891 the "Acquedotto Ciotta" was finished providing the city with modern sewage and water supply system. He was also a founder of several philanthropic initiatives and institutions. 
The “system Ciotta” underwent crisis in 1896 when Hungarian Prime Minister Dezső Bánffy started a centralizing policy towards Fiume. Ciotta, being unable to assure the equilibrium between Fiume and Hungary, resigned and retired to private life, following the Governor Lajos gróf Batthyány de Nemetujvár. As a response Michele Maylender, backed by Luigi Ossoinack (initiator of the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company "Adria"), founded a new party, the Autonomist Association, ending the rule of the Liberal Party of Hungary in Fiume.

The Dolní Žleb Ferry is a cable ferry across the Elbe river at Dolní Žleb in the Děčín District in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic.
Technically, the ferry is a reaction ferry, which is propelled by the current of the water. The ferry is attached to a floating cable which is anchored firmly in the riverbed upstream of the ferry. To operate the ferry, it is angled into the current, causing the force of the current to swing the ferry across the river on the cable.
