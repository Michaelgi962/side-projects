Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum

The Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum of Steam Power & Land Drainage is a small industrial heritage museum dedicated to steam powered machinery in Westonzoyland in the English county of Somerset. It is a Grade II* listed building and is on the English Heritage Heritage at Risk Register.
The museum is housed in the first of several similar pumping stations to be built on the Somerset Levels. The main attraction is the 1861 steam engine and pump, the only one still in its original location and in working order. The museum also displays a number of other steam engines and pumps, and runs the Westonzoyland Light Railway, a short, narrow gauge railway open to the public.
History.
The first mechanical pumping station on the Somerset Levels in southwestern England was built in 1830 to drain the area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery. The success of the drainage system led to the formation of other drainage boards and the construction of other pumping stations.
The station itself is a Flemish bond brick-built property with a slate hipped roof and chimney rising to in height. A cottage section was added alongside it in the 1860s, to provide accommodation for the station-keeper. Originally given a Grade II listing, the property was upgraded to Grade II* by English Heritage since it is now the only surviving station that still houses a functioning engine.
Beside the cottage is a long single-storey building that houses a 1914 Lancashire boiler; this was used to provide steam. Next to it is a forge, where the keeper would have made a number of his own tools. The boiler required constant running and thus consumed a good deal of coal.
The pump at Westonzoyland originally comprised a beam engine and scoop wheel (like a water wheel running backwards) but, after 25 years, there were problems pumping the water away because the land had dropped as it dried out. A better method was sought, and in 1861 the present pump was installed. The engine was built by Easton and Amos of London, to a design patented in 1858 by Charles Amos. It is a twin-cylinder, vertical condensing engine, driving a centrifugal pump. A similar engine was on display at The Great Exhibition of 1851 and was shown to be able to lift 100 tons of water per minute, to a height of . The Westonzoyland pump lifts water from the rhyne (pronounced 'reen') into the River Parrett. The pump operated until 1951, by which time the local drainage system had been linked into King's Sedgemoor Drain, which discharged further down the River Parrett; the water levels dropped and the pump was unable to draw the water from the rhyne. Additionally, the Parrett riverbank has now been raised by some eight feet in the vicinity of the pumping station and the opening to the river, from the base of the pump-well, is now bricked up.
During times of heavy rainfall, when additional pumping might be needed, the Environment Agency maintained a diesel pumping station next door with a capacity of 50 tons per minute. This was installed in 1951.
Restoration.
In 1976, members of the Somerset Industrial Archaeology Society began restoration of the site. The Westonzoyland Engine Trust was formed and in 1990 bought the site from the owners, Wessex Water.
Museum.
A collection of steam and diesel engines with connections either to the area or to pumping have been assembled on site and regular steam days are held. The oldest item dates from the early 19th century, through to several Victorian engines and onward to the 20th century. Most of these are now in running order.
The pump house has been Grade II* listed, and is on the English Heritage Heritage at Risk Register. Up until early 2010, the keeper's cottage had been off-limits to visitors. Two of the ground-floor rooms have now been opened: the living-room is furnished in a 1930s/40s style, while the old kitchen area currently holds a couple of display cases, with a view to showing hitherto unseen artefacts from the museum's collection of smaller items. The upper floors remain closed to visitors.
Steam is provided by an elderly Marshall portable boiler – essentially a portable engine without the actual "engine". This is a 1938 boiler, once used by Thames Water and later moved to Kew Bridge.
Engines by a range of other manufacturers are also on display. These include 'quick revolution' engines by Belliss and Morcom, Robey & Co., Easton and Johnson and Sissons. There are also horizontal engines by W. and F. Wills and by J. Culverwell, of Bridgwater. The Culverwell machine is a horizontal single cylinder steam engine originally used in Holt's Brewery at Burnham-on-Sea, while the Wills engine was used in a brickworks.
Additional exhibits include two small de Laval steam turbines by Greenwood & Batley, and a small 'Wessex' steam turbine. A winch used to move railway wagons at Hemyock Dairy near Wellington was built by J. Lynn of Sunderland. There is also a runnable Crossley diesel engine dating from 1935. There is a Spirax Sarco 'Ogden pump' used to pump condensate from steam lines.

Col d'Izoard

Col d'Izoard () is a mountain pass in the Alps in the department of Hautes-Alpes in France.
It is accessible in summer via the D902 road, connecting Briançon on the north and the valley of the Guil in Queyras, which ends at Guillestre in the south. There are forbidding and barren scree slopes with protruding pinnacles of weathered rock on the upper south side. Known as the Casse Déserte, this area has formed a dramatic backdrop to some key moments in the Tour de France, and often feature in iconic 1950s black-and-white photos of the race.
Details of the climb.
From the south, the climb starts at Guillestre from where it is in length, at an average gradient of 4.8%. The climb proper starts at the junction with the D947, near Chateau Queyras from where the ascent is long. Over this distance, the climb gains at an average of 6.9% and a maximum gradient of 10%. 
The climb from Briançon to the Col is in length, climbing at an average gradient of 5.7 % and a maximum gradient of 9.4%. In general, the col is closed from October to early June.
Tour de France.
The Col d'Izoard is frequently on the route of the Tour de France, where it is frequently classified as an Hors Categorie climb.
Several of the Tour de France's more memorable moments have occurred on the Col d'Izoard, particularly the exploits of Fausto Coppi, Bernard Thevenet and Louison Bobet. A small cycling museum is at the summit, along with a memorial to Coppi and Bobet.

Pedra Branca (Tasmania)

Pedra Branca is a 2.5 ha rock or small island about south-south-east of South East Cape, Tasmania, in south-eastern Australia. It is known for its inaccessibility, rich marine wildlife, wet and windy weather, interesting geology and large waves. It is part of the Southwest National Park, and thus in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Site.
The name means "White Rock" in Portuguese. According to historian Kenneth McIntyre, Pedra Branca is one of only two Australian places with a name of Portuguese origin, the other being the Houtman Abrolhos islands in Western Australia.
History.
Abel Tasman led the first known European expedition to sight Tasmania. His journal entry for 29 November 1642 records that he observed a rock which was similar to a rock named Pedra Branca off China, presumably referring to the Pedra Branca in the South China Sea. The journal places Pedra Branca "about " from the mainland of Tasmania, however a Dutch mile from this period was about 5.8 km, thus 4 such Dutch miles would be 23 km, which is close to the actual distance of Pedra Branca from South East Cape.
Shipwreck.
On 7 February 1973 Nisshin Maru No.8, a Japanese steel fishing vessel of 254 gross tons led by Captain Nakayama, on its way to Hobart for a mechanical inspection, hit Pedra Branca and sank in deep water within a few minutes. In the ensuing confusion only one of the crew of 22, engineer Yoshiichi Meguro, managed to clamber onto the rocks and escape drowning. The fishing vessel Walrus rescued the survivor.
The Nisshin Maru No.8 disaster led to considerable improvements in communications between the various authorities that should have been able to mount a rescue operation many hours before this one was commenced. These included direct links between Japanese fishing boats and Australian shore stations, and correcting the inability of fishing vessels to directly contact warships and military aircraft, as they were unable to contact the Hobart emergency radio station which did not operate at night.
Geography.
Pedra Branca is an erosional remnant of the Tasmanian mainland. It is approximately 270 metres (885 ft) long, 100 metres (330 ft) wide, and 60 metres (200 ft) high. This is small enough to provide an example of an outcrop that lies on the border between being a rock or islet and an island. The island is estimated to have separated from the mainland at least 15,000 years ago.
The geology features three breccia cones of dolerite and sandstone.
Weather.
Weather conditions in the area can be extreme, and Pedra Branca is occasionally swept by freak waves. On 15 April 2003 oceanographer Hamish Saunders drowned after being washed off Pedra Branca. The Coroner's Report into his death includes reports from three witnesses who describe how Saunders was swept away when a "wave hit the island resulting in heavy spray coming up to and over the 45 metre (148 ft) level". Waves were measured that day at up to 13.8 metres (45.3 ft) by the Cape Sorell Waverider Buoy, some away.
Flora and fauna.
The only plant species found on the island is the succulent "Sarcocornia quinqueflora". Recorded breeding seabird species include Fairy Prion, Pacific Gull, Silver Gull, Kelp Gull, Black-faced Cormorant, Australasian Gannet, and Shy Albatross. Australian Fur Seals use the island as a regular haul-out site while New Zealand Fur Seals visit occasionally.
Remarkably, the tiny, windswept island is the only known habitat of a species of lizard, the Pedra Branca Skink, "Niveoscincus palfreymani", which has survived for an estimated 15,000 years since Pedra Branca was separated from the Tasmanian mainland. An estimated 400 individuals survive, but the species is listed as Vulnerable.
Important Bird Area.
Together with the nearby Eddystone and Sidmouth Rock the island constitutes the 2 ha Pedra Branca Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports over 1% of the world populations of Shy Albatrosses and Australasian Gannets.

Plaster's Green Meadows

Plaster's Green Meadows () is a 4.3 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest near the village of Nempnett Thrubwell, Bath and North East Somerset, notified in 1989.
This is an area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral grassland community of a
type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora.
The site is characterised by the nationally rare Common Knapweed ("Centaurea nigra") and Crested Dog’s-tail ("Cynosurus cristatus") and dominant grasses include Sweet Vernal-grass ("Anthoxanthum odoratum"), Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog ("Holcus lanatus"), while Quaking Grass ("Briza media") and Yellow Oat-grass ("Trisetum flavescens") are also frequent.
There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort ("Serratuta tinctoria"), Dyer’s Greenweed ("Genista tinctoria"), Common Knapweed, Pepper-saxifrage ("Silaum silaus"), Devil’s-bit Scabious ("Succisa pratensis"), Betony ("Stachys officinalis") and Spiny Restharrow ("Ononis spinosa"). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of Cowslip ("Primula veris"), Fairy Flax ("Linum catharticum"), Glaucous Sedge ("Carex flacca"), Lady’s Bedstraw ("Galium verum") and occasional Salad Burnet ("Sanguisorba minor").
The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn ("Crataegus monogyna"), Wych Elm ("Ulmus glabra"), English Elm ("Ulmus procera"), Hazel ("Corylus avellana") and Field Maple ("Acer campestre"). Hedgerow trees include Ash ("Fraxinus excelsior"), Sweet Chestnut ("Castanea sativa"), Holly ("Ilex aquifolium") and Oak ("Quercus spp.").

Sunmudo

Sunmudo (선무도) is a Korean Buddhist martial art based on Seon (also spelled Sun or Zen), which was revived during the 1970s and 1980s. The formal name of Sunmudo is "Bulgyo Geumgang Yeong Gwan" (Hangul: 불교금강영관 Hanja: 佛敎金剛靈觀). The name Sunmudo was given to this martial art in 1984 by the Buddhist monk Jeog Un (적운 스님).
In earlier times Korean Buddhist monks were encouraged to practice Zen martial arts as a way of dynamic meditation. In the 1500s Korean monks used swords, knives, spears and throwing stars to help repel a Japanese invasion. However, the temple of the Korean monks was burned by retreating troops in revenge. In the 1930s and 1940s, a rebuilt Beomeosa temple became center for the monks' underground resistance to Japanese occupation. However, the martial art of Sunmudo had been neglected since the 19th century. At Beomeosa temple located in Busan, Monk Yang-ik revived the art by systematizing the techniques. Monk Jeogun worked on its popularization during the 1970s. These days training is offered to non-Buddhists and laypersons at Golgulsa temple in Korea, and other places around the world as well.

The S86 was a line number used by the Berlin S-Bahn.
A Line with many Routes.
This line number has been associated with four different routes during the last fifteen years. In June 1991, the line commenced service between Warschauer Straße and Buch. The line was altered in May 1993 to run between Pankow and Hauptbahnhof (now Ostbahnhof). The line was completed removed in May 1994. 
The line re-appeared as a night-time shuttle between Hermannstraße and Spindlersfeld in December 1999 before being removed again in June 2002. The line was re-introduced temporarily during construction works between September 2005 and May 2006.
Warschauer Straße to Buch.
This service ran for two years and provided an increased daytime service between Warschauer Straße and Buch. The line was extensively altered in May 1993 which effectively removed most of this service. The station listing below provides an overview of what the line looked like. The possible travel connections are correct for the period of operation and do not reflect the current travel connections for these stations.
Hauptbahnhof to Pankow.
In May 1993, the line was extended by one station to the Hauptbahnhof (now Ostbahnhof) with the northern section cut back to Pankow. This revised line existed for a single year when the line disappeared off the maps for a period of five years. The station listing below provides an overview of what the line looked like. The possible travel connections are correct for the period of operation and do not reflect the current travel connections for these stations.
S86: Night Line.
In December 1999, the line re-appeared as a night-time shuttle service between Spindlersfeld and Hermannstraße. This short line ran between 9pm and 4am to provide Spindlersfeld with a link to the network when the (S85) finished for the night. The line lasted until June 2002 when the new (S47) line started serving Spindlersfeld both day and night rendering the S86 obsolete.

<doc id="5986280" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5986280" title="Discover America">
Discover America

Discover America is a 1972 album by Van Dyke Parks released by Warner Bros., featuring Parks' take on Calypso music. Though only his sophomore release, it was considered a major departure from his debut record, 1968's psychedelic and folk-inspired "Song Cycle". "Discover America" is also notable in the Van Dyke Parks canon for featuring all cover versions of previously written songs.
The title is derived from the poem "I Am Waiting" by Lawrence Ferlinghetti.
Background.
Most of the album's songs were originally written by early Calypso musicians between the 1920s and 1940s, but had fallen into the public domain by the time "Discover America" was recorded in 1972. As such, nearly all of the songs are listed as "Public domain; arranged & adapted by Van Dyke Parks." Lyrical themes run a wide range of American history, from John Jones, to early 20th-century musicians Bing Crosby and The Mills Brothers, actor Jack Palance, and political figures Franklin Roosevelt and J. Edgar Hoover.
Parks would continue his study of Calypso and Caribbean music on his third album, "Clang of the Yankee Reaper", released in 1975. Throughout the 1970s, Parks acted as producer on Calypso albums for other artists, including The Esso Trinidad Tripoli Steel Band's "Esso" in 1971, and The Mighty Sparrow's 1974 album, "Hot and Sweet".
Song information.
The first track on "Discover America", "Jack Palance", is a one-minute clip of The Mighty Sparrow's actual version of the song. Parks did not cover any Mighty Sparrow songs on the album, but would later produce Sparrow's 1974 Warner Bros. release, "Hot and Sweet"; Parks would later re-release "Hot and Sweet" on his own record label, Bananastan in 2011.
"Introduction" is credited to Samuel Alter, and features an unknown man (likely either Alter or Parks) speaking into a tape recorder about Parnassus, Pennsylvania, Mount Olympus, and Daylight Savings Time. The third track is Parks' cover of "Bing Crosby", written by Roaring Lion. "Steelband Music" prominently features The Esso Trinidad Tripoli Steel Band on vocals and steel drums; "Steelband Music"'s original writer is unknown, and it may be a traditional Calypso song.
"The Four Mills Brothers" was written by The Lion (also known as Roaring Lion), and it speaks about the history and fame of jazz vocal group The Mills Brothers. The song's chorus is lifted from that of 1915 song "I Ain't Got Nobody", a song covered in the 1930s by The Mills Brothers.
"Be Careful" has been described by AllMusic as "a piece of advice from a father to a son when the offspring is approaching the age when love is being considered. A brilliant, almost chamber string arrangement carries the overall melody, yet this is combined with the Trinidad steel band music that Van Dyke Parks was fully and happily involved in at the time." The writer of "Be Careful" is unknown.
"John Jones" was performed by Trojan Records artist Rudy Mills in the late 1960s. "FDR in Trinidad" was written by Attila the Hun, and speaks about United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1936 visit to Trinidad. "FDR in Trinidad" also features performances by members of the band Little Feat.
A Rykodisc version of "Discover America" contains a bonus track, a cover of Joseph Spence's "Out on the Rolling Sea (Where Jesus Speaks to Me)".
Track listing.
All songs "public domain; arranged & adapted by Van Dyke Parks" unless otherwise noted.
A Rykodisc edition added "Out on the Rolling Sea (Where Jesus Speaks to Me)" to the end of the album.
Copyrights and legalities.
Nearly all tracks on "Discover America" are listed on the album sleeve as being "Public domain, arranged & adapted by Van Dyke Parks". However, many of the songs' original artists were still alive in 1972, but were not given writing credits on the album. At the time, The United States' Copyright Act of 1909 allowed for a copyright term of 28 years, followed by an optional one-time renewal for a second 28-year term. As such, the longest copyright allowed was 56 years from the original creation date.
The Copyright Act of 1976, signed into law only four years after "Discover America" was recorded, greatly changed copyright laws in the US, extending the copyright of the artist to either 75 years or the life of the author plus an additional 50 years.

Jimmy Foster (racing driver)

Jimmy Foster (born March 1, 1977 in Ormond Beach, Florida) is a former NASCAR driver. He was a part-time driver on the Busch Series from 1997-1999.
Foster made his debut in 1996, running the #11 Key Motorsports Chevy at Rockingham. He started 36th and only managed to finish 35th. However, he was able to complete the race. Foster gradually improved as he would end up making ten starts in all in the season. His best run was a 16th at NHIS and started 13th at Charlotte. However, inconsistenty weighed the team down and Foster was ultimately released. He had 5 DNFs in ten starts and only managed 51st in points. He did not race further in the season.
Foster ran five races in 1998, all for Washington-Irving Motorsports. He struggled in his starts, only finishing one race. That race, at Nashville, was his best finish of the year with a 25th. Foster's qualifying was significantly improved, however. He started 11th at Bristol and 9th at Texas, his first career top-10 start. However, the poor results led to Foster's unemployment once again.
Foster ran his final career race in 1999, driving for Blaise Alexander's #20 at Myrtle Beach Speedway. He started the race in 15th, but once again could not finish the race. He was 34th after overheating and it would prove to be the end of Foster's NASCAR career.

Bashley, Hampshire

Bashley is a village in the south of Hampshire, England. It lies in the New Forest on the outskirts of New Milton and is inland from the Solent.
History.
The history of Bashley can be traced to the Anglo-Saxon period. The earliest mention of Bashley is recorded in a charter belonging to Christchurch Priory where reference is made to an estate called Bagesluceleia for the year 1053. The name means "wood/clearing of Baegloc." This uncommon name was borne by an 8th-century abbot. 
In the time of the Domesday Book, 1086, the settlement was known as Bailocheslei, and was held in chief by Alsi the priest, who held it from the king. Alsi was entitled to the profits of "half a mill" amounting to 3 shillings.
Soon afterwards Bashley was acquired by Christchurch Priory. A chapel is recorded in Bashley as early as the 13th century. Until the Dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII, Bashley belonged to the Priory, although it was usually administered as part of the priory's Somerford estate. In 1262 William Boscher had held land in Bashley from Christchurch Manor, and in 1315 Robert Boscher died possessed of Bashley Manor. The priory still owned part of the original estate in 1384, when it received a grant of free warren there. This land seems to have been absorbed into their manor of Somerford; it is included in an account of the manor in 1628, and sixty years later there is mention of a copse at Bashley belonging to the manor. Bashley Common was inclosed in 1817.
Things of interest.
The centre of community life for the village is the Bashley Village Hall, which was built in 1946. In 1948 an additional were purchased "to enhance the life of the inhabitants of Bashley," and a lease was granted to Bashley Football Club to use the grounds. In the 1994–95 season, Bashley Football Club reached the Second Round proper of the FA Cup, and were hosts to Swansea City to whom they narrowly lost 1–0. Bashley Village Hall is also home to a popular flower show held annually.
In 1979 Bashley Cricket Club moved to its present ground at Bashley, having previously played cricket in the Bournemouth area. The village church is dedicated to Saint John, and is a daughter church of St. Mary Magdalene in New Milton.
At the north end of the village is the hamlet of Wootton. The pub at Wootton is "The Rising Sun", which has been on its present site for over two hundred years. To the east of Bashley flows the Danes Stream. The name derives from the Saxon word "denu", meaning "stream". Victorian romantics were so convinced that there must have been a battle involving the Danes (Vikings) here, that old Ordnance Survey maps actually marked a site of a battle at Bashley. To the west of Bashley is the settlement of Ossemsley.

<doc id="5986369" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5986369" title="Franco-Spanish War (1635–59)">
Franco-Spanish War (1635–59)

The Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659) was a military conflict that was the result of French involvement in the Thirty Years' War. After the German allies of Sweden were forced to seek terms with the Holy Roman Empire, the first French minister, Cardinal Richelieu, declared war on Spain because French territory was surrounded by Habsburg territories. The conflict was a continuation of the aims of the War of the Mantuan Succession (1628–31) in which France invaded northern Italy to take possession of territory claimed by the Spanish Habsburgs. The Franco-Spanish War ended in 1659 with the Treaty of the Pyrenees.
Background.
For years, the Kingdom of France, under the Valois and Bourbon dynasties, had been the rival of the House of Habsburg, whose two branches ruled Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, respectively. For much of the 16th and 17th centuries, France faced Habsburg territory on three sides – the Spanish Netherlands to the north, the Franche-Comté on its eastern border, and Spain to the south. The Habsburgs thus stood in the way of French territorial expansion, and during a time of conflict, France faced the possibility of invasion from multiple sides. France therefore sought to weaken Habsburg control over these border possessions.
During the Thirty Years' War, in which various Protestant forces battled Imperial armies, France provided subsidies to the enemies of the empire. France generously supported a Swedish invasion of the Empire after 1630. After a period of extraordinary success, the Swedish-led forces were decisively defeated in 1634 by a combined Spanish-Imperial army in the Battle of Nördlingen, leading to a peace treaty favorable to the Emperor. Unhappy with this outcome, France's First Minister, Cardinal Richelieu, decided in 1635 to actively involve his kingdom in the fighting and declared war on Spain.
During the Thirty Years' War (1635–1648).
During the last decade of the Thirty Years' War, the Spanish forces in the Spanish Netherlands were sandwiched between French and Dutch forces and the French won a major victory at Lens but Franco-Dutch forces could not decisively crush the embattled Army of Flanders. When the peace treaty was negotiated, France insisted upon Spain being excluded, but the demand was rejected by other parties to the talks. In the Peace of Westphalia, France gained territory in the Alsace, thus interrupting the Spanish Road; at the signing of the treaty, Spain recognized the independence of the Dutch republic but gave up little else; indeed the Spanish had to be paid to leave positions they had seized on the Rhine.
In Italy, France fought with the more or less reluctant support of its client state Piedmont against the Spanish in the Duchy of Milan. Confusion was added from 1639–1642 by the Piedmontese Civil War. The siege of Turin in 1640 was a famous event in both this war and the Franco-Spanish conflict. In 1646 a French fleet commanded by Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé (18 October 1619 – 14 June 1646) was defeated in Battle of Orbetello and the army it was sent to support was repulsed by Spain's Tuscan presidios; Milan remained firmly under Spanish dominance.
Later War (1648–1659).
[[File:Juanjosedeaustriaribera.jpg|Battle of Valenciennes (1656)
The year 1648 witnessed the eruption of a major revolt against royal authority in France, known as the Fronde. Civil war in France continued until 1653, when royal forces prevailed. At the Fronde's conclusion, the whole country, wearied of anarchy and disgusted with the princes, came to look to the king's party as the party of order and settled government, and thus the Fronde prepared the way for the absolutism of Louis XIV. The general war that had been initiated by the French nobles continued in Flanders, Catalonia and Italy, wherever a Spanish and a French garrison were face to face, and Condé, with the wreck of his army, openly and definitely entered the service of the king of Spain. This "Spanish Fronde" was almost purely a military affair and, except for a few outstanding incidents, dull to boot. Spain's condition was itself no better than France's as in addition to her own "fronde" and fighting in Italy she was still battling the revolt in Portugal and the French-backed Catalan Revolt. The Spanish focused their main efforts on recovering Catalonia and various Italian territories for strategic reasons; this helped the Portuguese to consolidate their rebellion.
In Italy, the war along the border between Piedmont and the Spanish-held Duchy of Milan continued. Twice, in 1647–1649 and 1655–1659, France managed to open a second front against Milan by gaining the alliance of Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena, but this never achieved the desired result of breaking the Spanish defence. In the south, the Neapolitan revolt collapsed and the French forces backing it were driven out by the Spanish forces in 1648.
In Spain, the French, weakened by the Fronde, were unable to hold Catalonia against reconquest by the Spanish forces; the French cause was undermined when the Catalans discovered that the French were even more overbearing than their former Spanish Habsburg masters and many switched their loyalty back to the chastened regime in Madrid. Taking advantage of French divisions, Spanish forces, under Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, sallied forth from the Netherlands on two occasions: the first met a spirited defence assisted by local peasantry; the second successfully seized several northern French forts in February–March 1652. Having lost support from the Catalans, weakened by internal squabbles and threatened by the Spanish from the north once again, the French were obliged to withdraw most of their forces from south of the Pyrenees. The remnants of Catalan resistance and the depleted French forces in Barcelona surrendered to Spanish Habsburg forces in October 1652. The Spanish remained distracted by the Portuguese Restoration War, and although they carried the war north, across the Pyrenees into the old Catalan county of Roussillon, the fighting was desultory and the front stabilised, with the Pyrenees as the effective border.
By 1653 general exhaustion had reached the point that "neither invaders nor defenders were able to gather supplies to enable them to take the field until July. At one moment, near Péronne, Condé had Turenne at a serious disadvantage, but he could not galvanize the Spanish general, Count Fuensaldaña, who was more solicitous to preserve his master's soldiers than to establish Condé as mayor of the palace to the King of France, and the armies drew apart again without fighting. In 1654 the principal incident was the Siege and Relief of Arras. On the night of the August 24–August 25 the lines of circumvallation drawn round that place by the prince were brilliantly stormed by Turenne's army, and Condé won equal credit for his safe withdrawal of the besieging corps under cover of a series of bold cavalry charges led by himself, as usual, sword in hand.
In 1655 Turenne captured the fortresses of Landrecies, Condé and St Ghislain. In 1656 the prince of Condé revenged himself for the defeat of Arras by storming Turenne's circumvallation around Valenciennes (July 16), but Turenne drew off his forces in good order. The campaign of 1657 was uneventful, and is only to be remembered because a body of 3,000 civil war hardened English infantry, sent by Cromwell in pursuance of his treaty of alliance with Mazarin, took part in it. The presence of the English contingent and its very definite purpose of making Dunkirk a new Calais, to be held perpetually by England, gave the next campaign a character of certainty and decision which had been entirely wanting in the latter stages of the war."
Dunkirk was besieged promptly and in great force, and when Don Juan of Austria and Condé appeared with the relieving army from Veurne, Turenne advanced boldly to meet them. The Battle of the Dunes, fought on June 14, 1658, was the first real trial of strength since the Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine. The battle resulted in an Anglo-French triumph over the forces of Spain and Condé. Dunkirk fell and was handed over to England, as had been promised by the French. It would remain under English rule until 1662 and its sale by Charles II to Louis XIV.
A last desultory campaign followed in 1659, which ended when the Spanish repelled French advances in Italy.
Aftermath.
The Peace of the Pyrenees was signed on November 5, 1659. France gained the territory of Roussillon and territories along its border with the Spanish Netherlands. In return, France agreed to end its support for the breakaway kingdom of Portugal in the Portuguese Restoration War. On January 27, 1660 the Prince de Condé asked and obtained at Aix-en-Provence the forgiveness of Louis XIV. The later careers of Turenne and Condé as great generals were as obedient subjects of their sovereign.

Bramshaw

Bramshaw is a small village and civil parish in Hampshire, England. It lies just inside the New Forest. The name Bramshaw means Bramble Wood. Until 1895, Bramshaw was divided into two parts, one half in Wiltshire, and one half in Hampshire. The village of Bramshaw is stretched out for several miles along the B3079 road, with the church to the north, the hamlet of Brook to the south and Stock's Cross at its centre.
Overview.
Bramshaw is a village and civil parish in the New Forest National Park. It includes large tracts of land owned by the National Trust, and Crown Land administered by the Forestry Commission. It is located some 10 miles west of Southampton. The parish contains the hamlets of Brook and Fritham.
Bramshaw Commons, owned by the National Trust, comprise some of manorial wastes and commons. It is some of the best surviving example of lowland heath in Europe, still managed by the common grazing of ponies, pigs, donkeys, cattle and sheep. The parish also contains the highest point in the New Forest at Pipers Wait, some 129 metres above mean sea level. The site of a 14th-century Royal Hunting Lodge ("Studley Castle"), can be seen nearby. The site of a former stocks and gallows can be seen at Stocks Cross, at the intersection of Furzley Lane and the B3079. The gallows were still in use in 1831, when records show that they were repaired.
The Admiralty Shutter Telegraph Line had a station at Telegraph Hill, near Bramshaw. It was an optical shutter signal station used as a communication link for the Admiralty during the Napoleonic Wars.
History.
Bramshaw appears twice in the Domesday Book for Wiltshire, when the lands were held by Wulfnoth and a certain Edmund. Odo of Bayeux was overlord of these lands in Bramshaw at the time of the Survey. The name Bramshaw probably derives from an Old English word for "bramble bush wood." It may be that it is Bramshaw being referred to in 1418 in a legal record, (appearing as "Bremelelsthaw").
The manor of Bramshaw, together with that of Britford, appears to have been granted by one of the Norman kings to the family of de Lacy sometime during the 12th century. In the 15th century it was sold to Robert Lord Hungerford. It switched hands during the Wars of the Roses, but in 1485 it was back in the hands of Hungerford family, being awarded to Mary Hungerford, wife of Sir Edward Hastings. Their grandson, the third Earl, sold the manor of Bramshaw (which from this time seems to have been also known as "Moore Closes") in 1561. It was sold several times in the next 150 years, until it was purchased in 1713 by Richard Paulet, in whose family the manor remained until 1887.
Saint Peter's church belonged at an early date to the Premonstratensian priory of Britford. In 1158, however, Henry II granted the church to Salisbury cathedral, when it was appropriated to the resident canons, and from that date the patronage was in the hands of the Dean and chapter of Salisbury. The current church dates from the 13th century, albeit with many later additions. The earliest part of the church is the west end of the nave, which is of mid-13th-century date, and there is a cambered beam roof of late 15th century date. Much of rest of the church, including the chancel and vestry, are of 19th century construction.
Bramshaw was partly in Wiltshire and partly in Hampshire until the "County of Southampton Act 1894" placed it all into Hampshire. The county boundary ran through the churchyard, and through the church, which had its nave in Wiltshire and its chancel in Hampshire. There were separate parish councils, one for Bramshaw (Hampshire) and one for Bramshaw (Wiltshire), which survived as Bramshaw (West) and Bramshaw (East) until 1932 when they were unified.
Bramshaw village school was founded in 1812 and closed in July 1977. Through those 165 years it served the children of Bramshaw and nearby hamlets in the New Forest, Brook, Fritham and Furzley. Children passed through Bramshaw School, usually on their way to labouring and servant jobs in the forest and on the estates.
The school began life as a Boys' School, registered as a National School in 1812 with the Girls' and Infants' School being registered in 1819. At that time it was described as 'privately owned', only being registered as a Public Elementary School in 1851 when it began to be supported with government funding. George Eyre (1772-1837), owner of the local Warrens Estate. founded the school, 'demonstrating a paternalistic attitude to the labourers and their children, while providing a picturesque addition to the village scene'. The school remained connected to the Eyre family until the death of the then Mrs Eyre in 1933. After the 1944 Education Act introduced the eleven plus examination, older boys and girls moved to a new Secondary Modern School at Bartley, leaving two classes of 5 to 7 and 7 to 11 year-olds. When the school in 1977 5 to 8+ year olds went to Copythorne First School while children from 8+ to 12+ went to Bartley Middle School. The school building has become a private dwelling.

Bernhard von Eskeles

Bernhard, Knight and Baron von Eskeles (Ritter und Freiherr von Eskeles") (12 February 1753, Vienna – 7 August 1839, Hietzing (near Vienna, now Vienna)) was an Austrian-Jewish banker/financier and Court Jew.
He was born Bernhard Eskeles, the posthumous son of Rabbi Issachar Berush Eskeles, son of the Polish-Moravian Rabbi Gabriel Eskeles. At an early age he went to Amsterdam, where he entered a commercial house, of which he became manager at the age of 17, but met with reverses, and lost the fortune which his father had left to him.
In 1774 he returned to Vienna, married Caecilie (Zipperche) Itzig (1760–1836), a daughter of Daniel Itzig of Berlin, and joined in partnership and entered the business of his brother-in-law Nathan Arnstein, with whom he established the banking-house of "Arnstein and Eskeles", which came into great prominence during the Congress of Vienna. They were patrons of Mozart and also of Ignaz Moscheles who gave piano lessons to Caecilie. At this period Eskeles's drawing-room was the rendezvous of men like Talleyrand, Wellington, Castlereagh, Hardenberg, and Theodor Körner. Eskeles's name is often mentioned in the memoirs of this time. His advice in financial matters was frequently sought by Emperors Joseph II, and later by Francis II and I, who entrusted him with many important missions to foreign countries. He was sent to Paris and Holland in 1810. Eskeles was the founder of the Austrian National Bank (1816), and its director for 23 years. He was raised to the Austrian nobility in 1797, and became a "knight" in 1811, and a "baron" in 1822.
Eskeles took little interest in Jewish affairs, and during his short term of office as representative of the Jewish community new and vexatious measures were introduced which, according to his contemporaries, he might have prevented had he used his influence. He was, however, the founder of several charitable institutions. He also established, with an initial contribution of 50,000 gulden, a fund for the maintenance of poor students. His two children, a son, Denis, Baron de Eskeles (1803 - 1876), and a daughter, Maria Anna (Marianne) Cecilia Bernhardine Freiin von Eskeles, Countess of Wimpffen, wife of Franz Graf von Wimpffen, deserted Judaism. Denis, who succeeded his father in the management of the banking-house, married Wilhelmina, Baroness Brentano-Cimaroli, and by his death the male line of the house became extinct.

Ton van de Ven

Ton van de Ven (Eindhoven January 1, 1944) is a Dutch industrial designer. He is best known as the creative director at the Efteling theme park.
Van de Ven was born in Eindhoven, Netherlands, where he also studied at the Design Academy.
Work at Efteling.
After graduation in 1963, Van de Ven applied for a job at Efteling in 1965. Anton Pieck, leading designer at the time, only asked him one question: "Do you master perspective?" Ton bent the truth a little to say that he did. He then started to work with Pieck on various aspects of the park, gradually developing his own style, which never conflicted with the existing styles in the park.
Van de Ven's first project was to work with Pieck on the Indian Waterlilies. After a few sketches Pieck was convinced that he could fully trust the park in the hands of Van de Ven. When Pieck retired in 1975, Ton became the creative director of the park.
Van de Ven's first "own" ride was the Haunted Castle ("Spookslot") in 1978, the first big attraction in the park. He created many of the current Efteling landmarks, of which Fata Morgana and Dreamflight are considered to be his master pieces.
In 2002 Van de Ven retired from the park, and he could concentrate on his hobby - creating large paintings and sculptures of women. In Efteling, part of the St. Nicolaas square is renamed to Ton van de Ven square in his honor and his portrait appears in Villa Volta.

Stay the Night (Billy Ocean song)

"Stay the Night" is a 1980 song by Billy Ocean taken from his album "City Limit". It was released as the follow-up to his hit single "Are You Ready?", and was also released as the b-side to this single in some countries. The song has been covered by La Toya Jackson and sampled by dance artist Lady on the 2002 Brazilian hit single "Easy Love".
La Toya Jackson version.
"Stay the Night" was the third single released by American singer La Toya Jackson, and the first single from the 1981 album "My Special Love". The track was produced by Ollie E. Brown, who produced much of the "My Special Love" album. The lyrics were slightly rewritten to reflect the gender change from Ocean's version.
The single peaked at #31 on the "Billboard" Hot Soul Singles chart. The single was released on 7" and 12" formats, with "Camp Kuchi Kaiai" on the B-side.
"Camp Kuchi Kaiai" was one of two songs Jackson co-wrote with her sister Janet Jackson; the other was "Lovely Is She" on Jackson's previous album. "Camp Kuchi Kaiai" has become well known in the UK's rare groove scene.
Jackson performed "Stay the Night" on the 10 October 1981 episode of "Soul Train".

John Winthrop Hackett

Sir John Winthrop Hackett "Senior" KCMG (4 February 184819 February 1916) was a proprietor and editor of several newspapers in Western Australia, a politician and a University chancellor.
Early life.
Hackett was born near Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland, the eldest child of the Rev. John Winthrop Hackett, M.A., and his wife, Jane Sophia Monck, "née Mason" (daughter of Henry M. Mason, LL.D.). Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, he graduated B.A. in 1871 and M.A. in 1874. He was called to the Irish bar in 1874, but emigrated to Sydney, Australia, in 1875 where he was called to the New South Wales bar in the same year.
Career.
Hackett took up journalism and contributed to the "Sydney Morning Herald", but in 1876 went to Melbourne to become vice-principal and tutor in law, logic and political economy, at Trinity College (University of Melbourne). He also contributed to "The Age" and the "Melbourne Review". In 1880 he was a candidate for Normanby at an election for the Victorian Legislative Assembly as an advanced liberal, but was badly defeated and lost his deposit.
At a later election Hackett was opposed to John Madden, and this time lost by only a small margin. In 1882 he resigned his positions at Trinity College and went to Western Australia to become a squatter in the Gascoyne district. His first season was a bad one and he decided to give up the land. He joined forces with Charles Harper, the proprietor of "The West Australian", and very soon his influence on this paper began to be felt. "The Western Mail (Western Australia)" was established in 1885 and both papers became prosperous. In 1887 Hackett became editor of "The West Australian" and was a strong advocate of responsible government. Western Australia received its constitution in 1890, and Alexander Forrest selected Hackett as the first man to be asked to join the nominee Western Australian Legislative Council. The population of the colony was still under 50,000 but was beginning to rise, and the discovery of gold accelerated this. The newspapers grew with the population and became very valuable properties. Hackett, as editor, was writing a daily leading article, and was also the business manager.
In 1894 Hackett was elected to the Legislative Council as representative of the south-western province, and held this seat until his death. He was a delegate to the 1891 and 1897 Federal conventions, and was appointed a member of the constitutional committee. He was asked to join more than one ministry, but had to decline as it was impossible for him to add to the work he was already doing. He was also of the opinion that, as a newspaper editor, he would no longer be able to speak with the same freedom if he were in office. He advocated women's suffrage, and Western Australia was one of the early jurisdictions to give women the vote. He also strongly supported Forrest in his development policy, in the building of the pipe line to the goldfields, and the making of Fremantle harbour. He was interesting himself very much in the Perth public library, museums, and national gallery of which he became president, and also in the proposed university. He was a prominent member of the Church of England, holding the offices of registrar of the Diocese of Perth and chancellor of St George's Cathedral. He declined a knighthood in 1902 but accepted it in 1911, and two years later was created KCMG.
On 3 August 1905, Hackett married the 18-year-old, Deborah Vernon Brockman (1887-1965). They had four daughters, and a son also called John. John (1910-1997) also became Sir John Hackett, a popular and distinguished General in the British Army. After she was widowed, Lady Hackett remarried to become Lady Moulden, and finally - after an honorary doctorate and a further widowhood - Dr. Deborah Buller Murphy. 
The University of Western Australia opened in 1913 with Sir John as its first chancellor, and he gave it its first substantial private contribution when he endowed the chair of agriculture. Hackett's partner, Charles Harper, died in 1912, and Hackett acquired full ownership of the "West Australian" for £88,000. Hackett suffered from Parkinsonism and his health began to fail in 1915. He took a trip to the eastern states which appeared to have benefited him; however he died suddenly on 19 February 1916 of a heart condition and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.
Legacy.
Hackett was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. by Trinity College, Dublin in 1902. Under his will a bequest to the Church of England paid for the building of St George's College, the first residential college within the University of Western Australia. After provision for his widow and children, the residue of his estate went to the University which received the sum of £425,000. £250,000 of this with accrued interest was used for the erection of a group of buildings which include Winthrop Hall and Hackett Hall. Another £200,000 was used to set up a fund which still provides scholarships, bursaries and other financial help for deserving students.
The suburb of Hackett, in inner North Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia bears his name, in recognition of his efforts to support the federation of the Australian colonies, which took place in 1901. Streets and a suburb in Perth are also named 'Hackett' and 'Winthrop'.

Clang of the Yankee Reaper

Clang of the Yankee Reaper is a 1976 album by Van Dyke Parks, containing only one original Parks composition. It continues his exploration of Calypso music started in the previous album Discover America. In particular, it contains several songs by The Mighty Sparrow, and Lord Kitchener, as well as a diverse selection of past and present music in the tradition of the Americas.
Parks has reflected harshly of the album years later, describing it as "brain dead". He added, "That album was done at the nadir of my entire life. Psychologically I was in a terrible state, I was despairing. My best friend had just died – my roommate, he was my roommate. We scattered his ashes at sea, and they flew back into our faces... a terrible, terrible insult. I was grieving, I'd just been divorced, I'd just left Warner Brothers in disgust as I didn't want to be a corporate lackey, didn't approve of record business practices - you know, what can I say? 'Lost my job, the truck blew up, my dog died.'"
The title is taken from a poem by Parks' great-uncle Will Carleton.

Brook is a hamlet in the civil parish of Bramshaw, in Hampshire, England. It lies just inside the New Forest. 
The hamlet contains a mix of 18th and 19th century cottages, just south of the village of Bramshaw. There are two inns in Brook on opposite sides of the road - The Green Dragon and The Bell Inn. Both buildings date from the 18th century, albeit with 19th and 20th century alterations. Brook is also home to the club-house of Bramshaw Golf Club, which claims to be the oldest golf club in Hampshire
Just south of the village at Lower Canterton lies the Rufus Stone. This stone is said to mark the place where in 1100 the then King of England, William Rufus, was killed by an arrow whilst out hunting. The arrow was fired by a French nobleman, Walter Tyrell, but it has never been established if the death was an accident or murder.

Be Prepared (song)

"Be Prepared" is a song from the 1994 Disney animated film and 1997 Broadway musical "The Lion King". The song was composed by Tim Rice (lyrics) and Elton John (music) and originally performed by Jeremy Irons, Cheech Marin, Jim Cummings (who took over after Irons's voice gave out), and Whoopi Goldberg in the film and by John Vickery, Kevin Cahoon, Stanley Wayne Mathis, and Tracy Nicole Chapman in the original Broadway cast for the musical. 
"The Lion King".
Original.
The song is performed as a musical number by Scar. Lusting for the position as king of the Pride Lands, a title held by his envied older brother Mufasa, he constantly spends time devising evil schemes that could potentially earn the throne for him with the assistance of his hyena minions, Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. In it, Scar is inspired to develop a plot in which he will arrange for both Mufasa and his nephew Simba to be murdered and notifies his spotted hyenas about it through song, earning more minions for himself through his pledge to spare the hungry animals from starvation if they provide him with assistance. 
Production.
Originally, the song was about Scar introducing the hyenas to the lionesses after he pronounced himself king and when the lionesses opposed him. This idea was scrapped in favor of the song in the film. It was called "Thanks to Me". A reprise of the song after Mufasa's death was also cut from the film, but is featured in the musical version.
In the beginning of the second verse, an army of hyenas is shown goose-stepping in front of Scar, who is perched on an overlooking cliff in resemblance of Adolf Hitler with countless beams of light pointing straight-up (resembling the Cathedral of light featured in many of the Nuremberg Rallies). Shadows cast onto the cliff evoke for a brief second monumental columns. This is modeled after footage from the Nazi propaganda movie "Triumph of the Will".
Jeremy Irons performed the majority of the song, but after he threw out his voice singing the line "You won't get a sniff without me!" towards the end, the song is sung by Jim Cummings, who also voices Ed.
Original recording.
On the original soundtrack recording, Scar opens the song with a soliloquy:
In the film, this is cut and the song begins immediately. This was due to a plot adjustment. The soliloquy had Scar considering using the hyenas for his plot, but in the final version of the story he had already used the hyenas in his plans before the song.
Deleted reprise.
During production of the film, there was originally supposed to be a reprise of the song which takes place after Scar has assumed power over the Pride Lands and is trying to assert his dominance over the lion population. He is given the idea by Zazu to find a mate, as that will give him cubs, and in his own words, "eternity". He starts to flirt with Nala, who refuses his advances and is therefore banished by Scar. He then unleashes the hyenas upon the Pride Lands as their "executive rulers".
The reprise was ultimately removed from the film. However, a similarly themed song entitled "The Madness of King Scar" was included in the Broadway musical version of the film.
"The Lion King 1½".
In DisneyToon's 2004 direct-to-video film "The Lion King 1½", the music from the beginning of the song is briefly heard as Timon and Pumbaa tour Scar's lair as a possible new home, commenting on how it is quiet, secluded and with no uninvited visitors. The shadows of the goose-stepping hyena army are then seen marching in front of them, though they haven't started singing yet. Timon and Pumbaa stare at them for a few seconds, and remark that the hyenas "ain't the traveling company of Riverdance." They then riverdance out of the scene.
"The Lion King musical".
Like the original soundtrack recording, Scar begins the song with a brief soliloquy. The song is similar to its film counterpart in most respects, including the goose stepping hyenas, but there is a dance number performed by the hyena ensemble halfway through. Scar later sings a brief reprise while declaring himself king at Mufasa's funeral in which he introduces the hyenas as his direct and privileged minions. However, the Broadway reprise was not featured in the soundtrack, and is instead replaced with a sinister chord at the end of the song "Rafiki Mourns". In other soundtracks from different productions, the song is not represented at all.
"Festival of The Lion King".
In Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom's "Festival of the Lion King", Kiume sings the song while the theater takes on a darker tone with the male dancers carrying spears and shields, while the female dancers dance with streamers. After Kiume sings the first verse, the solo hyena performer does a tribal dance with a fire torch. In the finale, when the snippet of "Be Prepared" is sung, the hyena comes back out but dances with blades.

Jeff McClure

Jeff McClure (born January 22, 1967 in Harrisburg, North Carolina. He is a former NASCAR driver, having racing multiple years in all three major series.
Winston Cup Series.
McClure only made one career start in NASCAR's elite series and it came in 1992 at the 1992 running of the Champion Spark Plug 400. He qualified the Jim Rosenblum Racing 39th at Michigan. He did finish the race, however, it was only a 31st place finish.
Busch Series.
McClure made his Busch debut in 1988, running his own #83 Oldsmobile in four races. His series debut came at Nazareth, falling out due to an engine failure. McClure's finishes improved drastically every race and by the race at Langley, McClure earned his best finish of the year in 18th. Also, his best start of the year ended up 12th at Myrtle Beach.
McClure made two starts in 1989. He finished 19th at Charlotte and 25th at Rockingham.
McClure had one start in 1990. He started 41st at Daytona, but was caught up in a late crash. However, McClure still managed 22nd and the season opener at Daytona would prove to be his only 1990 start.
McClure returned after a six year hiatus in 1996, running three races for Moy Racing. After finishing 26th and 31st, McClure finished 16th at the Milwaukee Mile. It would prove to be his best career finish in the series.
McClure was then invited back for ten races in 1997 for Moy. McClure's team struggled in his starts. His best start was 32nd and best finish was 23rd at Las Vegas. The poor results can be explained to his five DNFs in ten starts.
Craftsman Truck Series.
McClure reappeared on the NASCAR scene in 2000, running three CTS races for Albernaz Racing. He started 29th and finished 26th at Portland. His next start at Texas proved to be his best. He was 21st in that race. At Nazareth, McClure earned his best career start of 28th and looked to be in good shape for bettering his previous starts. However, a late engine failure ended his CTS career in 23rd.
McClure has not raced in major NASCAR since that Nazareth start in 2000.

Origines

Origines ("Origins") is the title of a historical work by Marcus Porcius Cato. 
History of the Text.
This highly original work was the first prose history in Latin, and among the very first Latin prose works in any genre. Along with Livius Andronicus, Naevius, Ennius and Plautus, Cato helped to found a new literature.
According to Cato's biographer Cornelius Nepos, the "Origines" consisted of "seven books. Book I is the history of the early kings of Rome; books II and III the beginnings of each Italian city. This seems to be why the whole work is called "Origines"." The city histories in books II and III of the work were apparently treated on an individual basis, drawing on their own local traditions. The last four books dealt with Rome's later wars and the growth in the city's power; they "outweighed the rest", according to one later reader.
There were two existing historical works in Latin, by Naevius and Ennius, but they were in verse, not prose. There were two existing prose histories by Romans, Q. Fabius Pictor and Lucius Cincius Alimentus, but they were written in Greek. All four of these existing works focused on Rome throughout; moreover, the two poems wove Roman history inextricably into the adventures of the Graeco-Roman gods. In "Origines", Cato evidently chose to do it differently. He felt no need to follow precedent, Roman or otherwise:
Cato's own achievements were not downplayed: he was "not the man to minimize his own achievements". The "Origines" included several of his own speeches verbatim. He made it a rule not to mention military commanders by name, yet the surviving fragments give the impression that Cato's campaigns were highlighted.
"Origines" no longer survives as a complete text, but substantial fragments are known because they were quoted by later Latin authors.

Banglalink

Banglalink Digital Communications Limited, DBA Banglalink (), is the second largest cellular service provider in Bangladesh after Grameenphone. As of June 2013, Banglalink has a subscriber base of 27 million with 25.7% market share. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Telecom Ventures Limited of Malta which is owned by Global Telecom Holding.
Banglalink had 1.03 million connections until December, 2005. The number of Banglalink users increased by 257 per cent and stood at 3.64 million at the end of 2006, making it the fastest growing operator in the world of that year. In August, 2006, Banglalink became the first company to provide free incoming calls from BTTB for both postpaid and prepaid connections. On August 20, 2008, Banglalink got past the landmark of 10 million subscriber base.
History.
Sheba Telecom (Pvt.) Limited was granted license in 1989 to operate in the rural areas of 199 upazilas. Later it obtained GSM license in 1996 to extend its business to cellular mobile, radio telephone services. It launched operation under the brand name Sheba in the last quarter of 1997 as a Bangladesh-Malaysia joint venture.
In July, 2004, it was reported that Egypt based Orascom Telecom is set to purchase the Malaysian stakes in Sheba Telecom through a hush-hush deal, as Sheba had failed to tap the business potentials in Bangladesh mainly due to a chronic feud between its Malaysian and Bangladeshi partners. An agreement was reached with Orascom worth US$25 million was finalized in secret. The pact has been kept secret for legal reasons, considering financial fallout and because of the feud.
The main reason for the undercover dealing was the joint venture agreement between the Bangladeshi and the Malaysian partners, which dictates that if any party sells its Sheba shares, the other party will enjoy the first right to buy that.
Integrated Services Ltd. (ISL), the Bangladeshi partner, was being ‘officially’ shown as purchasing the shares held by Technology Resources Industries (TRI) of Malaysia for US$15 million. ISL then paid another US$10 million to Standard Chartered Bank to settle Sheba's liabilities.
In September, 2004, Orascom Telecom Holdings purchased 100% of the shares of Sheba Telecom (Pvt.) Limited. It was acquired for US$60 million. Sheba had a base of 59,000 users, of whom 49,000 were regular when it was sold. Afterward it was re-branded and launched its services under the Banglalink brand on February 10, 2005. Banglalink’s license is a nationwide 15-year GSM license and will expire in November, 2011.
In March, 2008, Sheba Telecom (Pvt.) Limited changed its name as Orascom Telecom Bangladesh Limited, matching its parent company name.
In July, 2013, Banglalink changed its company name as Banglalink Digital Communications Limited after the merger between Orascom Telecom and VimpelCom Ltd.
Numbering scheme.
Banglalink uses the following numbering scheme:
+880 19 N1N2N3N4N5N6N7N8
Where, +880 is the ISD code for Bangladesh and is needed only in case of dialing from outside Bangladesh.
19 is the access code for Banglalink as allocated by the Government of Bangladesh. Omitting +880 will require using 0 in place of it instead to represent local call, hence 019 is the general access code.
N1N2N3N4N5N6N7N8 is the subscriber number.
Products offered.
Prepaid packages.
Banglalink currently offers two prepaid plans. All the prepaid plans come in two phases—Standard (T&T incoming and outgoing with Nation Wide Dialing and ISD) and M2M. All connections provide GPRS to subscribers.
Former Packages:
Postpaid packages.
Currently there are three postpaid plans from Banglalink for its tail customers. These packages are known as enterprise personal, which is a subset of much larger Banglalink enterprise. All packages come with T&T local, Nation Wide Dialing, ISD and e-ISD connectivity.
Former Packages:
Banglalink customer care.
Banglalink delivers customer care using its call centers and customer care networks. Currently Banglalink provides customer care services through:
Criticisms and penalty.
In October, 2007, BTRC fined Banglalink Tk. 1.25 billion for its involvement in illegal VoIP or call termination business. The then BTRC chairman major general (retd.) Manzurul Alam confirmed Banglalink's involvement in the illegal trade. Banglalink, however, in a statement said the company has agreed to make a one time fixed payment of Tk. 1.25 billion to the government as compensation for its loss in revenues.

North and South Open

The North and South Open was one of the most prestigious professional golf tournaments in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century. It was played at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina, long the largest golf resort in the world, which also staged a series of other tournaments with the "North and South" moniker, some of which continue to this day. The event ran from 1902 to 1951 and was won by many major champions, including three-time winners Walter Hagen, Ben Hogan, and Sam Snead. Played in March through 1944, the final seven events were held in early November.
It was cancelled when the pros asked the patrician patriarch of Pinehurst, Richard Tufts, who was a great champion of amateurism, to increase the prize money in line with PGA Tour rates. The final tourney's purse was $7,500 in 1951, with a winner's share of $1,500. The Ryder Cup was held at the course the previous week, but only five of the nine on the winning U.S. team stayed to play.

Percival Prentice

The Percival Prentice was a basic trainer of the Royal Air Force in the early post-war period. It was a low-wing monoplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Front seating was in a side-by-side configuration with a rear seat provided.
Design and development.
Designed to meet Air Ministry Specification T.23/43, the Prentice was the first all-metal aircraft to be produced by the Percival Aircraft Company. The prototype Prentice TV163 first flew from Percival's factory at Luton Airport, Bedfordshire on 31 March 1946. Early trials revealed inadequate rudder control, resulting in a revised rudder and a large cut-out in the elevators. The aircraft were later modified with turned-up wingtips. Over 370 were delivered to the RAF between 1947 and 1949.
An unusual design feature was the provision for three seats. While the instructor and pupil were equipped with dual controls in a side-by-side arrangement in the front, a second pupil sat in the rear seat without controls to receive "air experience". Both pupils could communicate with the instructor. Night flying training was to be carried out in daylight by means of amber screens incorporated into the canopy and the use of special goggles. The amber screens were folded back when not in use.
Several hundred Prentices were ordered for RAF use. Since the Percival factory was concentrating on production of the Percival Proctor and the Merganser light transport aircraft, production was sub-contracted to the Blackburn Aircraft works at Brough.
Operational service.
After these modifications, the Prentice was passed into RAF service, initially with the regular Flying Training Schools (FTS) where they replaced the remaining de Havilland Tiger Moths. Later deliveries went to the Reserve Flying Schools (RFS). The type was used as a pilot trainer until late 1953, when it was replaced by the Percival Provost. Two Air Signals Schools also operated the type to train air signallers, until the last were withdrawn from No.1 ASS at RAF Swanton Morley, Norfolk, in mid 1956.
Civilian operations.
252 redundant RAF Prentices were later bought in 1956 by Aviation Traders Ltd, a company owned by Freddie Laker. and were stored at Stansted and Southend. Most were eventually scrapped but 28 were converted for civil use with two seats and two jumpseats behind the two pilots' seats, separated by a structure which housed the original 4-channel radio. This conversion had quite poor performance with 4 passengers. One aircraft was converted to a seven-seat layout for pleasure flights. One (G-AOPL) was acquired from Shackleton Aviation at Sywell by Captain Jon Cousens, a Desert Intelligence Officer in the Trucial Oman Scouts and flown to Sharjah in 1967; later being flown on to South Africa where it remained until it ceased flying.
The aircraft had a poor performance with any load at high temperatures and initially had poor spin recovery.
Forty-two aircraft were built under licence by Hindustan Aircraft for the Indian Air Force.

The Wilby Conspiracy

The Wilby Conspiracy is a 1975 thriller film directed by Ralph Nelson and filmed in Kenya. It was written by Rodney Amateau, based on the 1972 novel by Peter Driscoll. It had a limited release in the US.
Plot.
In apartheid-era South Africa, Shack Twala (played by Sidney Poitier), a black revolutionary who had served time on Robben Island, is freed by Rina van Niekerk, his Afrikaner defence attorney, because he would be a victim of retroactive legislation. Rina, estranged from her husband Blane, is having a relationship with an English mining engineer, Jim Keogh (played by Michael Caine), who has attended Shack's trial. Surprised by the verdict, Rina, Jim and Shack go off to celebrate at her house. They are stopped by the South African Police who are conducting identity document checks and arresting everyone who does not have their papers on them. As Shack has only just been released from prison he will not receive his papers until the next day. The police Constable and Shack antagonise each other leading to Shack being handcuffed and arrested. When Rina attempts to pull the Constable off Shack, the policeman hits her, knocking her to the ground. Jim assaults and knocks out the Constable making all three fugitives.
At Police Headquarters, an SAP Brigadier is criticised by Major Horn of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS) for not only arresting Shack but continuing with their random identity checks and arrests that have infuriated world opinion.
The three fugitives are followed and monitored by BOSS to lead them to discover their escape route to Botswana and its facilitators, two Indian dentists; a stash of stolen uncut diamonds being used to fund the "Black Congress" (African National Congress) and the leader of the "Black Congress", a man named Wilby.
Additional Notes.
After this motion picture, Poitier moved into both directing and acting. In addition, the film introduced Dutch actor Rutger Hauer to English-speaking audiences. Hauer went on to act in several of director Paul Verhoeven's early movies. "The Wilby Conspiracy" was also the western film debut of Indian actress Persis Khambatta, who would appear in "" and with Rutger Hauer in "Nighthawks".

Skelmersdale railway station

Skelmersdale railway station was a station located on the Skelmersdale Branch at Skelmersdale, England. The station was originally named Blague Gate, having its name changed to Skelmersdale on 8 August 1874 and carried passengers from 1858 to 1956.
History.
The station was one of several built by the East Lancashire Railway on their branch line from Ormskirk to Rainford Junction. It opened on 1 March 1858, but after a year became part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway system when the ELR was taken over by that company. The station consisted of two platforms with the main building on the northbound side. A wooden signal box was provided to control the adjacent level crossing, passing loop and nearby goods yard. The line towards Ormskirk was subsequently doubled in 1875, the year after the station was renamed.
Throughout its life the route operated as a self-contained branch, though connections were available for , Liverpool & Blackpool at Ormskirk and for , and Manchester Victoria at Rainford. The service was also generous, with the L&Y running a steam railmotor service of 19 trains per day in each direction from 1906. A similar pattern continued after the route became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in January 1923, but increasing road competition after World War II and the subsequent nationalisation of the railways in 1948 saw traffic levels decline.
The station was closed to passenger traffic by the British Transport Commission on 5 November 1956, with the line south to Rainford closing completely on 16 November 1961 and the rest on 4 November 1963, when goods traffic at the station ceased. The track was lifted in 1968 and station was demolished soon afterwards; the B5312 road (known as "Railway Road") now passes through the site.
Ironically this was done just as the town was undergoing a significant increase in population levels and associated housing development, having been designated as one of the second wave of new towns in 1961 (it was chosen, along with Runcorn as an overspill town for Liverpool).
Re-opening proposals.
There have been proposals made to reopen Skelmerdale railway station, which would require three-mile rail restoration. In January 2009, the Liverpool Echo newspaper reported that recommendations have been put to councillors to endorse the £60m plan to build a new railway station in Skelmersdale, reconnecting the town with Liverpool.
In June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies, in its report, called for funding for the reopening of this station as part of a £500m scheme to open 33 stations on 14 lines closed in the Beeching Axe, including seven new parkway stations. The report proposes extending the line from by laying 3 miles of new single track along the previous route to the town, at a cost estimated to be in the region of £31million. The route is largely intact, though a deviation north of Westhead would be required. The proposed station would be on north west corner of town near the Skelmersdale Ring Road, right next to where the old station once was. A feasibility study on the project jointly funded by Merseytravel, Merseyrail, Lancashire County Council & West Lancs Borough Council is due to begin in the autumn of 2013.

Nazia Hassan

Nazia Hassan () (3 April 1965 – 13 August 2000) was a Pakistani pop singer. Her song, "Aap Jaisa Koi", from the Indian film "Qurbani" (1980) made her famous in Pakistan and all of South Asia in the 1980s. Her debut album, "Disco Deewane" (1981), also charted in fourteen countries worldwide and became the best-selling Asian pop record up until that time. She, along with her brother Zohaib Hassan, went on to sell over 60 million records worldwide.
Hassan was the first Pakistani to win a Filmfare Award and remains the youngest winner of a Filmfare Award in the category of Best Female Playback Singer to date when she was 15. Hassan is a recipient of the Pride of Performance, Double Platinum Award and Golden Discs Awards.
Personal life.
Background.
Hassan was born into a Muslim family in Karachi, Pakistan and brought up in Karachi and London. She was the sister of singer Zoheb Hassan and Zara Hassan.
She received her bachelors in Business Administration and Economics at the Richmond American University in London. In 1991, she became an intern in the Women’s International Leadership program at the United Nations. Later on she went on to work for United Nation’s office of Political and Security Council Affairs. Nazia Hassan held a London University law degree (LLB).
Nazia Hassan was the daughter of Basir Hassan, a businessman, and Munizeh Basir, an active social worker. She had two siblings, brother Zohaib and sister Zahra, both of whom became singers. Nazia was married on 30 March 1995 to Ishtiaq Beg but they divorced ten days before her death. They had a son, Arez, on 7 April 1997.
Her illness.
Hassan fought a long battle with cancer during the last years of her life and died of lung cancer in London on 13 August 2000 at the age of 36. She had been admitted to North London Hospice in London N12 three days earlier when her condition deteriorated. She showed signs of mild recovery the day before she died and it was thought that doctors would allow her to go home. But early Sunday morning, her mother Muneeza was called to the hospital where her daughter had started coughing heavily at around 9:15 am. She died within minutes. She is buried at Hendon Cemetery (Muslim Section) in London. In an interview, her brother revealed that she died as an unhappy person.
The Government of Pakistan has conferred upon Hassan the highest civilian award Pride of Performance. The award was presented to Hassan's mother, Muniza, by the President of Pakistan in an official ceremony held at Islamabad on 23 March 2002.
Career.
1975–1980: Beginning.
Hassan began singing during the late 1970s, when she appeared on several television shows on Pakistan Television (PTV) as a child artist. Her professional career started at the age of fifteen when she provided the lead vocals for the song "Aap Jaisa Koi" from the 1980 film Qurbani. She met the film director Feroz Khan at a party in the United Kingdom. Khan later requested Hassan have an audition with Biddu, a London-based Indian music composer. Biddu then signed her up for "Aap Jaisa Koi", the song he composed for Qurbani.
The song was a huge success in India and despite Hassan being a Pakistani, she gained overnight fame there. In 1981, Hassan won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback for "Aap Jaisa Koi".
1981–1987: Pop music.
After the success of "Aap Jaisa Koi", Qurbani became a big hit and she collaborated with Biddu on numerous other projects. In 1981, she became the first playback singer to release an album. Her first album was "Disco Deewane". The album broke sales records in Pakistan and India and even topped the charts in the West Indies, Latin America and Russia. This album became a mega-hit and Hassan became an established pop singer in Pakistan. The album also had vocals by her brother Zohaib Hassan.
After the release of "Disco Deewane", she and Zoheb were offered the chance to act in a movie by Biddu, but they refused to act and chose singing. Hassan's second album "Star/Boom Boom" was released in 1982 for which she was nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer. The soundtrack of the album was used in the movie Star. The film did not succeed at the box office but the album was successful and increased the popularity of Hassan and her brother Zoheb in Pakistan and India.
Her third album, "Young Tarang" was released in 1984. It was the first album in Pakistan to feature music videos, which were made in London by "David & Kathy Rose". The album became one of the most popular in Asia. "Ankhien Milane Wale" was a popular song from the album. After the release of "Young Tarang", she returned to singing for Bollywood movies as a playback singer.
Her fourth album, "Hotline" was released in 1987. "Aa Haan" was the most popular song of the album.
Music 89 and retirement.
At the end of 1980, she had become the most popular pop singer of Pakistan. In 1988, she and her brother Zoheb appeared with music maestro Sohail Rana in his television program, "Sung Sung". In the following year, she and Zoheb hosted the groundbreaking show "Music '89". The show was produced by Shoaib Mansoor. It was the first-ever all pop-music stage show to be aired on television. The show launched the careers of many new rising bands and singers and became popular in Pakistan. She hosted another show, "Dhanak" on PTV in the same year, 1989.
In 1991, Hassan and her brother Zoheb recorded her fifth album, "Camera Camera". Before the album's release, she and Zoheb announced during a launching ceremony that it would be their last album. The album was released in 1992. It was not as successful as her previous albums and received only average reaction. After the album's release, she left her singing career to focus on her personal life.
In 1991, she joined the Department of Political and Security Council Affairs at the United Nations Headquarters in New York and worked there for two years. In her third year, she offered her services at UNICEF. Her social and academic excellence won her a scholarship in Columbia University’s Leadership Program, but she was unable to take up the offer because around this time she was diagnosed with cancer.
The composer of her albums, Biddu, composed a song, "Made in India" and he wanted Nazia to sing it. But the retired Hassan refused to sing a song that might offend Pakistan. The song was then offered to Alisha Chinai.
Legacy.
Pakistan's vibrant contemporary music scene owes itself to Nazia Hassan's redefinition of pop. In fact, the biggest 1990s bands, including the Vital Signs and the Jupiters, got a platform on "Music '89".
Hassan also had a seismic impact in India. India Today magazine voted her as one of the top 50 people who helped change the face of India. She has contributed to the development of the present isomorphism of Bollywood music and pop. "She set – well ahead of its time – the personal album trend in India, spawning the likes of Alisha Chinai, Lucky Ali and Shweta Shetty", the magazine noted at the time. After the huge success of their music, Nazia and Zoheb were signed by EMI Group and were the first South Asian singers to be signed by an international music company.
She used her abilities to promote social causes. All the money earned from music was spent on charity. She specially worked for children, youth and women in distress residing in the underprivileged areas of Karachi. She supported the "Inner Wheel Club" of India and helped raise funds for it. In Pakistan, she established the organization "BAN" (Battle Against Narcotics) and became an active member of organizations such as Voice of Women, National Youth Council of Pakistan.
She worked with Javed Jabbar, former Information minister, to raise funds for children in Rajasthan. She went to a very large number of schools to hand-out toys to poor children and gave talks on the subject of social awareness for the under privileged. Hassan never forgot the love and support of all the schools and always spoke about them with great affection. The worthy staff and the students of St Joseph's Convent School, Mama Parsi School and many others had gone out of their way to help the cause.
Surprisingly, music was only a hobby for Hassan and though her achievements in this field were anyone’s dream come true, she lived away from the glitzy world and led a secluded and simple life. She completed her education in the UK, got a law degree and then worked in the United Nations in the Security Council. She continued her social work even in New York and worked for children from the UN platform.
She is known as the "Sweetheart of Pakistan". Hassan is still the symbol of grace, sacred beauty and innocence and is frequently compared to Princess Diana, as she was known to possess a heart of gold.
In 2007, Ahmad Haseeb created the documentary "A Music Fairy" in a tribute to Hassan which was screened at Kara Film Festival and University of Ankara.
Foundation.
In 2003, Hassan’s parents created the Nazia Hassan Foundation to further their daughter’s efforts to make this world a better place for everyone, regardless of caste, creed and religion.

Geoffrey Hosking

Geoffrey Alan Hosking FBA FRHistS (born 28 April 1942) is a British historian of Russia and the Soviet Union and formerly Leverhulme Research Professor of Russian History at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES) at University College, London.
Born in Troon, Ayrshire, Scotland, Hosking studied Russian at King's College, Cambridge, earning an MA, before studying Russian history at Moscow State University. He then studied European history at St. Anthony's College, Oxford, before earning a PhD in modern Russian history at Cambridge.
He taught at the University of Essex as a Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, and then Reader from 1966 to 1984, before joining SSEES, where he held the established chair of Russian History from 1984 to 2007. He also held a Leverhulme Research Professorship in Russian History at SSEES from 1999 to 2004.
He has been a visiting lecturer in political science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, a research fellow at Columbia University's Russian Institute, and a visiting professor at the University of Cologne.
Hosking presented the BBC Reith Lectures in 1988. His aim was to explain the dramatic changes of the Mikhail Gorbachev era in their historical context.
Most of Hosking's works until this point had dealt with twentieth-century Russia and the Soviet Union, but after the collapse of the Soviet system he turned his attention to earlier periods of Russian history, producing "Russia: People and Empire, 1552-1917" and "Russia and the Russians". In these books, Hosking emphasized the polarity between the Russian Imperial idea (denoted by the term 'Rossia') and Russia's ethnic nationhood (defined by the older term of 'Rus'). According to Hosking, the development of the Russian Empire prevented the development of Russia as a nation state. In his next book "Rulers and Victims - The Russians in the Soviet Union", Hosking examined aspects of this polarity in the Soviet context. 
Hosking retired from UCL SSEES in December 2007. The established chair that he held was reinaugurated in 2008 as the Sir Bernard Pares chair of Russian History. Its first incumbent was Hosking's former research student, Simon Dixon.

Parkerville, Western Australia

Parkerville is a suburb in the Shire of Mundaring in Western Australia. 
Jane Brook flows through Parkerville on its way down to the Swan River through John Forrest National Park.
History.
The Nyoongar people were the original custodians of the land. The arrival of British settlers in 1829 on the Swan Coastal Plain eventually led to Nyoongar dispossession in the Hills behind Perth. The Parkerville Suburban Area was made open for selection in June 1895.
Parkerville was one of the first stations to be constructed on the railway line that once ran between Bellevue and Mount Helena, opening for traffic in 1896. The town was named in honour of Stephen Henry Parker whose country home, now the Old Mahogany Inn, was situated nearby. Parker was a prominent member of Perth's legal fraternity.
In 1903 Sister Kate of the Community of the Sisters of the Church, purchased of land at Parkerville for the "League of Charity Home" for children, which became the Parkerville Children's Home. Clutterbuck Creek is named after Sister Kate's parents. In 1909 the construction of the chapel was completed. Sally Morgan, in her landmark novel My Place, writes how three year old Gladys is taken to this orphanage.
In 1966 the railway line was closed as part of a change of route to the Avon Valley. The railway route has become the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail as a bridle and walking path.
The Parkerville Amphitheatre became the site for a number of 1970s concerts. This and other nearby locations have been used for filming children's television series.
By the early 2000s, Perth's suburban growth was placing development pressures on Parkerville.
In January 2014 houses in Parkerville and neighbouring suburbs were destroyed in wildfire 
Education.
There are two schools in Parkerville today: Parkerville Primary School and the Silver Tree Steiner School.

Good God (Korn song)

"Good God" is a song written and recorded by American nu metal band Korn for their second studio album, "Life Is Peachy". It was released as the album's third single in November 1997.
Concept.
Jonathan Davis says about the song: "It's about a guy I knew in school who I thought was my friend, but who fucked me. He came into my life with nothing, hung out at my house, lived off me, and made me do shit I didn't really wanna do. I was into new romantic music and he was a mod, and he'd tell me if I didn't dress like a mod he wouldn't be my friend anymore. Whenever I had plans to go on a date with a chick he'd sabotage it, because he didn't have a date or nothing. He was a gutless fucking nothing. I haven't talked to him for years."

The ZiS-151 () is a general-purpose truck, produced by the Soviet Union in 1947–58, at Automotive Factory No. 2 "Zavod imeni Stalina". In 1956, the factory was renamed "Zavod imeni Likhacheva", and new trucks were called ZiL-151 (). 
The ZiS-151 was the first major Soviet military all-wheel-drive truck built following World War II, replacing the U.S. Studebaker US6 and earlier ZiS-6. Externally, it resembles the International Harvester KB-7. In early 1948, the cabs were made of wood, soon replaced with a steel cab. Tens of thousands were produced, including specialized versions for hauling different types of cargo. The Soviets also found the trucks an ideal platform for BM-13 "Katyusha" rocket launchers. 
The most famous developments of ZiS-151 were the BTR-152 armored personnel carrier and the BAV 485 amphibious vehicle.
In 1958 ZiL-151 model was replaced by the ZIL-157, differed outwardly by grille and having single rear wheels, instead of the ZiL-151's dual wheels.

Indian Imperial Association (Fiji)

The Indian Imperial Association of Fiji (I.I.A.) was active in Fiji during the last years of the indenture system, safeguarding the interests of and assisting in the improvement of the Indian community.
Established as British Indian Association of Fiji.
The original Association was established in 1911, following a severe hurricane that had brought much hardship to the Indians in the Central division, with the name British Indian Association of Fiji. It was formed by a group that included J.P. Maharaj (a Suva Storekeeper), Totaram Sanadhya (a pundit and social worker from Rewa), Ram Singh (a Suva printer) and Ram Rup. The meeting was chaired by Shriyut Rupram and discussed grievances such as the lack of educated leadership amongst the Indians and the dependence on European lawyers. Totaram Sanadhya was responsible for its Hindi language correspondence.
Under the Leadership of Manilal Doctor.
The Indian Imperial Association of Fiji (I.I.A.) came into existence in Fiji on 2 June 1918 after the arrival of Manilal Doctor, who asked for the original name of the association (British Indian Association of Fiji) to be changed because the name had the word "British" in it and Manilal, being a citizen of Baroda State, was not a British subject. Manilal became the President of the Indian Imperial Association of Fiji and Ram Singh its Secretary. The association contained mainly educated Fiji Indians. It sent petitions to the Government seeking review of marriage law, an end to the death penalty and representation into the Legislative Council. The aim of the association was to ‘watch the interests of and to assist in the general improvement of the Indian community in Fiji’. As president of the I.I.A., Manilal Doctor wrote to Gandhi, other Indian leaders and the British Labour Party on the sad plight of Indian indentured labourers in Fiji. C.F. Andrews and W.W. Pearson were dispatched to Fiji to enquire into the complaints. Manilal Doctor made submissions for their report, published on 29 February 1916, which reported on the deplorable living conditions of the indentured labourers and their lack of access to education and medical facilities.
Accomplishments.
The case of Viraswamy is an example of the success of I.I.A. Viraswamy was an educated young man, who had been recruited in Madras on the understanding that he would be working on a post officer in the government office. When he arrived in Fiji in October 1911, he was sent to work with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. He was initially employed as a telephone operator, but when he complained that he was not being given the promised job, he was sent to work in a cane field. He wrote to the I.I.A. and Manilal Doctor forwarded his case to the Anti-Slavery Society of London. The Society approached the Colonial Office and Veeraswamy was able to buy his freedom and get employment outside the indenture system.
After the appointment of Badri Maharaj as the nominated member representing Indians in the Legislative Council (Fiji), the I.I.A. took on the role of an opposition party because Badri Maharaj had little support amongst the Fiji Indians. The I.I.A. was allowed to present an address of welcome to Admiral Lord Jellicoe, on behalf of the Indian community, during his visit to Fiji in 1919.
On 26 December 1919, the Association organised a conference in the Suva Town Hall, which Manilal chaired and which passed a number of resolutions, including a call for independence for India, sympathy for the victims of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and other resolutions relating to Fiji Indians. On 29 December 1919 the Association sent a list of request to the government which included the following:
The Colonial Secretary, ignored the requests.
The Demise of I.I.A..
Following, the strike of 1920, and after the Government decided to deport Manilal, the I.I.A. organised petitions in different languages, asking for him to be allowed to stay in Fiji. After Manilal was deported from Fiji in 1920, the I.I.A. collapsed. In the 1920s attempts were made to revive the I.I.A., having representatives from all sections of the Indian community, with Ilahi Ramjan as President, Ram Singh as Secretary and Deoki and Ram Samujh as vice-presidents. It made representations to the Secretary of State for the Colonies about residential tax and other issues, but the Government regarded it as representing only the urban educated Indians and refused to recognise it. It thus died a natural death, although attempts were made in later years to establish a similar association.

Muhammad after the conquest of Mecca

The period of "Muhammad after the conquest of Mecca" started with the Conquest of Mecca in 630 and ended with his death in 632.
History.
This period was preceded by the period of Muhammad in Medina.
630.
Conquest of Mecca.
The Muslim army entered and occupied Mecca in the year 630 CE. In 628 the Meccan tribe of Quraish and the Muslim community in Medina signed a truce called the Treaty of Hudaybiyya. Despite improved relations between Mecca and Medina after the signing of the "Treaty of Hudaybiyya", a 10 year peace was to be broken by Quraish who, with their allies, the tribe of "Bakr", attacked the tribe of "Khuza'ah" who were allies of the Muslims. However, Muhammad considered the treaty broken. Abu Sufyan, the leader of the Quraish in Mecca, was aware that the balances were now tilted in Muhammad's favour, went to Medina to restore the treaty but Muhammad refused to accommodate him and Abu Sufyan returned to Mecca empty-handed. A Muslim army of 10,000 soldiers marched towards Mecca which soon surrendered. Muhammad acted generously to the Meccans, demanding only that the pagan idols around the Kaaba be destroyed. Abu Sufyan converted to Islam and Muhammad announced, "Who enters the house of Abu Sufyan will be safe, who lays down arms will be safe, who locks his door will be safe".
Battle of Hunayn.
The Battle of Hunain was fought between Muhammad and his followers against the Bedouin tribe of Hawazin and its subsection the Thaqif in 630 in a valley on one of the roads leading from Mecca to al-Ta'if. The battle ended in a decisive victory for the Muslims, who captured enormous spoils. The Battle of Hunayn is one of only two battles mentioned in the Qur'an by name, in Sura. The Hawazin and their allies, the Thaqif, began mobilizing their forces when they learnt from their spies that Muhammad and his army had departed from Medina to begin an assault on Mecca. The confederates apparently hoped to attack the Muslim army while it besieged Mecca. Muhammad, however, uncovered their intentions through his own spies in the camp of the Hawazin, and marched against the Hawazin just two weeks after the conquest of Mecca with a force of 12,000 men. Only four weeks had elapsed since quitting Medina. The Bedouin commander Malik ibn Awf al-Nasri ambushed the Muslims at a place where the road to al-Taif enters winding gorges; the Muslims, surprised by the assault of the Bedouin cavalry, who they thought were encamped at Awtas, began retreating in disarray. Modern historians have been unable to fully reconstruct the course of the battle from this point onwards because the different Muslim sources describing the battle give contradictory accounts. Because Malik ibn Awf al-Nasri had brought the families and flocks of the Hawazin along, the Muslims were able to capture huge spoils, consisting of 6,000 women and children and 24,000 camels. Some Bedouins fled, and split into two groups. One group went back, resulting in the Battle of Autas, while the larger group found refuge at al-Ta'if, where Muhammad besieged them.
Siege of Ta'if.
The Siege of Taif took place in 630 CE, as the Muslims besieged the city of Taif after their victory in the Battle of Hunayn and Autas. However, the city did not succumb to the siege. One of their chieftains, Urwah ibn Mas'ud, was absent in Yemen during that siege.
631 CE.
Battle of Tabouk.
The Battle of Tabouk (also called the Battle of Tabuk) was a military expedition said to have been led by Muhammed in October 630 CE. According to Muslim biographies, Muhammed led a force of as many as 30,000 north to Tabouk in present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia, with the intention of engaging the Byzantine army. Though not a battle in the typical sense, if historical the event would represent the opening conflict in the coming Byzantine-Arab wars. There is no contemporary Byzantine account of the events, and much of the details come from later Muslim sources. Noting this, as well as the fact that the armies never met, some Western scholars have questioned the authenticity of the details surrounding the event; though in the Arab world it is widely held as historical.
Ghassanids.
The Ghassanids were a group of South Arabian Christian tribes that emigrated in the early 3rd century from Yemen to the Hauran in southern Syria, Jordan and the Holy Land where some intermarried– discuss with Hellenized Roman settlers and Greek-speaking Early Christian communities. The term Ghassān refers to the kingdom of the Ghassanids.
Thaqif adopts Islam.
Thaqif, the main tribe of the town of Ta'if adopted Islam in 632.
632.
Thursday, June 4 — Muhammad's will.
Muhammad became ill and his health took a serious turn on a Thursday. He summoned his companions and announced that he wanted to write a will, he asked for writing materials to write a statement that would "prevent the Muslim nation from going astray for ever". The first person to reply was Umar, answering that there was no need for any will, arguing that Muhammad was ill and that Umar had the Qur'an which was sufficient for him.
Saturday, June 6 — Usama's dispatchment.
Muhammad had earlier sent an expedition against the Byzantine Empire (Roman) that resulted in what was known as the Battle of Mut'ah. The leader of that expedition was the dark colored Zayd ibn Haritha, Muhammad's former adopted son. Zayd died during that expedition.
Monday, June 8 — death.
He died on Monday, June 8, 632 A.D/ 12 Rabi' ul-Awwal, 11 A.H.
Aftermath.
This period was followed by the period of the Succession to Muhammad.

Farringdon, Hampshire

Farringdon is a village in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire in England. The village is 2.8 miles (4.5 km) south of Alton, on the A32 road, close to a source of the River Wey.
The village has two parts, the larger being Upper Farringdon. Lower Farringdon is on the Alton to Gosport road, the A32. The 2001 census predicted a population for Farringdon Parish by 2006 of 495.
The northern of the River Wey's two sources rises in countryside close to Farringdon (Grid Reference: SU707394).
History.
Archaeological finds in the village include a Bronze Age beaker (found in September 1938) with a cruciform design on the base, of which only two examples are known; and a Roman coin, a Sestertius of Trajan (found in 1936). Both are now in Alton Museum. Farringdon was listed in the Domesday Book as Ferendone; the word means fern-covered hill. The village has a Norman church and a number of pre-18th Century houses.
Notable people and buildings.
Farringdon has close associations with two of Britain's most celebrated figures, the novelist Jane Austen (1775-1817) and the naturalist Gilbert White (1720-1793). Austen would come from her home in nearby Chawton, a little over a mile to the north, to visit friends and acquaintances in Farringdon. From 1761 to 1785 White was curate of Farringdon's village church of All Saints, and his pulpit still survives. One of the parish registers contains entries in his handwriting. Gilbert White's house, now a museum, is a little over three miles west of Farringdon. All Saints has Norman and 12th/13th century origins and retains good stained windows. The churchyard contains yew trees reputed to be of great antiquity; the hollow nature of the trees makes ring-counting dating impossible, but estimates have suggested that the trees may be as much as 2,000 years old. 
A Farringdon landmark is Massey's Folly, an imposing but eccentric building with towers and battlements built by another curate of Farringdon, Rev. T.H. Massey. Its intended purpose during its construction was obscure, but since a few years after the Reverend's death in 1919 it has served as a school and village hall, and is currently undergoing restoration; it was featured in the 2006 BBC TV programme, "Restoration Village".
Transport.
Farringdon's closest railway station is at Alton, 2.8 miles (4.5 km) north of the village. The A32 passing through Lower Farringdon was formerly a major route, but the old Alton-Gosport road is passed to the west and east by two major trunk routes, the M3 and the A3(M). As result, traffic density through Farringdon is relatively light. A 30 mph limit is in force.

<doc id="5986932" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5986932" title="Home Invasion (album)">
Home Invasion (album)

Home Invasion is the fifth solo album by Ice-T. Released in February 14, 1993, the album (which was originally set to be released in 1992 as part of his deal with Sire/Warner Bros. Records) was Ice-T's first official release as an artist on his own label Rhyme Syndicate Records, now in full control of the content of the release, as part of his new distribution deal with Priority Records.
History.
"Home Invasion" was the first album that Ice-T released following the controversy over the Body Count song "Cop Killer." Sire/Warner Bros. Records had stood by freedom of expression during the controversy, although some within the Time Warner conglomerate now favored a more pragmatic policy. "Home Invasion" was originally set for a November 15, 1992, release, but the Rodney King riots were still fresh in people's minds, an election was in process, and political releases by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre were causing controversy, so Ice T agreed to postpone "Home Invasion's" release, in addition to removing the song "Ricochet," which had already appeared on the soundtrack to the film of the same name.
With the album's release postponed to February 14, 1993, Sire/Warner Bros. told Ice-T that it would not release the album with its current artwork, painted by Dave Halili (cover artist for Body Count), which depicted a white youth who is seemingly engrossed in black culture surrounded by images of violence, mayhem and disorder. Although the catalog number "45119" was already assigned to it and the single “Gotta Lotta Love” was released, the album was still deferred. Ice-T initially agreed, opting for an all-black cover and a name change to "The Black Album". He later realized that his future output was going to be continuously monitored and censored, so he left the label amicably, signing a distribution deal with Priority Records, which released the album with the originally intended artwork. Due to the postponed release of the album, tracks were altered to keep the topics up-to-date.
In 2004 Jay-Z released a song called 99 Problems using the same title and chorus as the Home Invasion track.
Ironically the Jay-Z version of 99 problems was featured on his eighth studio release named "The Black Album" ( Roc-A-Fella Records).
Lyrical themes.
"It's On" begins with the phrase "Turn up the mike, dog, so I can get off/Find me Charlton Heston and I might cut his head off." Charlton Heston had pushed for Ice T's contract with Sire/Warner Bros. to be dissolved. The title track explored the concept of a white supremacist home being invaded by political emcees who were seeking to rescue the children from racist indoctrination. "Gotta Lotta Love" pays tribute to the gang truce in L.A and discusses the benefits of Blacks and Latinos living in harmony. "That's How I'm Living" is autobiographical, describing Ice T's early life. "Race War" is a reflection on the riots and a warning against such events repeating themselves. "Message to the Soldier" offers advice to those involved in political hip hop. After abstaining from sex rhymes on "O.G. Original Gangster", Ice-T made a point of including two such tracks on this album with "Hit the Fan" and "99 Problems."
Reception.
The album peaked at #9 on "Billboard" magazine's "Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums" and at #14 on the "Billboard 200". "Home Invasion" was the last hip hop release of Ice T that had significant political content. His later releases were more in tune with the rest of gangsta rap. This is reflected in how this album featured the end of the accumulated pleas that had appeared inside the pamphlets of his albums since "Power". "Home Invasion" is also often seen as the release with which Ice T's career began to take a downturn. Reviews were generally less impressed than they had been with his earlier work. The hip hop audience was moving away from political artists at the time. The rivalry between the West and East Coast was also at its peak. Ice-T had always stayed out of the dispute. He also didn't seem to fit neatly into either camp; he hailed from the West Coast, but his raps were more in the style of the East Coast.
Track listing.
"The Last Temptation of Ice".
The album was re-released with a bonus disc titled "The Last Temptation of Ice". Its track listing follows.

NER Class H

The North Eastern Railway (NER) Class H, classified as Class Y7 by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) is a class of 0-4-0T steam locomotives designed for shunting.
Description.
Introduced in 1888 by Thomas W. Worsdell, six were built in 1888. Their simple, bare design easily navigated the tight curves and poor quality track which they ran on. The H proved so successful, that the NER ordered a further ten in 1891, three in 1897 and five more were ordered by the LNER in 1923.
Due to their small size, these engines did not have a bunker in the traditional position behind the cab, so coal was piled up on top of the side tanks immediately in front of the cab. The H shared their simple domeless boiler design with the H1 (J78) and H2 (J79) classes.
The locos were originally fitted with dumb buffers, but these were changed for small round buffers during the 1930s, some also gaining vacuum brakes during this period; only hand and steam brakes were fitted when built.
Locomotives operating at Tyne Dock were altered to take shunting poles on each corner of the loco, giving the ability to pull a wagon on an adjacent line.
Numbering and livery.
The LNER originally painted the Y7s in black with ¼inch vermillion lining; repaints after 1928 omitted this with locomotives in plain black.
Two entered British Railways stock in 1948, becoming BR 68088 and 68089.
Operation and preservation.
The original work of these locos was on Tyneside, at Hull docks, and within Darlington works, but LNER no.8088 was recorded working at Stratford works between 1943 and 1952.
Dock work was hit hard by the depression, and between 1929 and 1932 the sixteen locomotives which made up the first two batches delivered were withdrawn, nine being sold to industrial use while the remainder were scrapped.
Two have survived to preservation:

Tempo (bridge)

In the card game of bridge, tempo refers to the advantage of being on lead, thus having the initiative of developing tricks for one's side.
According to the rules of the game, the right to select the first card to play ("the opening lead") belongs to the defenders; afterwards, the right to lead belongs to the hand who has won the previous trick. Being on lead generally presents an advantage, as it presents an opportunity to choose a suit and card which will develop a trick for the leader's side. However, in endplay situations being on lead certainly does not present an advantage—quite the opposite.
The tempo can be used for many purposes:
Examples.
In this extreme example, whoever leads first will take the first 8 tricks, regardless of the denomination. That means that neither side can make any contract, and every contract will fail by at least two tricks—the advantage of having on opening lead makes a three-trick difference.
Keeping initiative—"gaining tempo"—by not taking a finesse can be decisive to prevent the opponents from developing defensive tricks.
Against South's 4 west leads the A (indicating the king) and continues with the 8. The opening lead, although natural, was unfortunate, as it gave the declarer a tempo to develop heart tricks for himself. However, it is now essential "not" to take the diamond finesse so as not to lose tempo. South must take the A and play to the A, again refraining from finessing. Now, the declarer can lead hearts for ruffing finesse and discard diamonds until West covers with the K, then ruff and cross over to A, again refusing to finesse. On the remaining hearts, all diamonds including the queen are discarded. In total, the declarer loses one trick in trumps, hearts and clubs each.
Note that a diamond opening lead sets the contract, as it doesn't give the tempo in hearts to the declarer: the declarer must lose a heart and two diamonds before he sets up the hearts for diamond discards; the trump king is the fourth trick for the defense.

Fritham

Fritham is a small village in Hampshire, England. It lies in the north of the New Forest, near the Wiltshire border. It is in the civil parish of Bramshaw.
History.
The name Fritham may be derived from Old English meaning a cultivated plot ("hamm") in scrub on the edge of a forest ("fyrhth").
The oldest feature in Fritham is a Bronze Age Bowl barrow, known as "The Butt" which lies just east of the village, although it has been partially damaged on top by a brick structure.
Fritham is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. It was once thought that the Domesday settlement of Truham (or Trucham) may have been Fritham, but this is now thought unlikely as Truham was within Boldre Hundred. The first mention of Fritham appears early in the 13th century, when Geoffrey de Baddesley held land in Baddesley and Fritham. Fritham remained attached to the manor of South Baddesley in the parish of Boldre at least until 1429. 
The Royal Oak - a thatched cottage with red-brick additions - is one of the oldest pubs in the New Forest, dating back to the 1600s. Fritham Lodge, dating from 1671, may have been one of Charles II hunting lodges. A school and chapel opened in Fritham in 1861.
From the 1860s until the 1920s Fritham was home to the Schultze gunpowder factory. The factory specialised in smokeless powder for sporting guns. Established in 1865, it was at one time the largest nitro-compound gunpowder factory in the world, with sixty separate buildings and a staff of a hundred. It supplied three-quarters of the world's annual consumption of gunpowder for sporting purposes and often sent 100-ton consignments to the Americas loading road vans and special railway trucks for the docks at Southampton. Little now remains of the factory except for the superintendent's and gatekeeper's houses. Eyeworth Pond, near Fritham, was specially created by the factory as a reservoir to hold water needed during the manufacturing process.
Four young men from Fritham went down with the Titanic in 1912; Leonard Mark Hickman, Leonard Hickman, Stanley George Hickman, Ambrose Hood.
The Ham class minesweeper HMS Fritham was named after the village.

<doc id="5986980" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5986980" title="Battle of Autas">
Battle of Autas

The Battle of Autas or Awtas was an early battle involving Muslim forces, fought in the year 630 in Awtas, Saudi Arabia, after the Battle of Hunayn, but prior to the Siege of Ta'if. Muhammad came with 12,000 fighters against a coalition of tribes. An ambush took place and a rain of arrows were fired on the Muslims.
Background.
A league of Mountain tribes hostile to Muhammad formed an alliance to attack him. The non-Muslim author Washington Irving claims that the tribes were hostile to Muhammad because he was spreading Islam by the sword, which greatly displeased the tribes.
The league consisted of Thakefites, Hawazins, Joshimites, Saadites and several other hardened Mountain tribes. According to Islamic tradition the valley of the Banu Sa'd (who Irving refers to as Saadites) is where Muhammad was nurtured as a child and was also purified by an Angel.
The Thakefites were idolaters who worshipped Allāt. They controlled the productive area of Taif, and were also the tribe which drove Muhammad out of Taif, pelting stones at him in the public square, when he was first preaching Islam. Another reason according to Irving that the tribes joined together was that they knew Muhammad was preparing to come back to Taif with a vengeance with his newfound power.
Battle.
After the Conquest of Mecca, the neighboring tribes of Hawazin and Thaqueef were given the choice of converting to Islam, or going to war with Muslims. Muhammad went to Autas with 12,000 men. 
As the Muslim army passed through the valley of Hunain, a group of hostile tribes fired rain of arrows on the Muslims. 
The attacked surprised the Muslims, and many fled away from the arrows. Only 9 men remained with Muhammad. Including Uthman. After a while the Muslim regrouped and gathered around Muhammad. They then marched to Autas, after a confrontation, the tribes were defeated and the Muslims captured a large amount of war booty.
Primary sources.
The Sunni hadith collection Sahih Muslim mentions that Muhammad sent an army to Autas:

<doc id="5987010" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987010" title="Vocontii">
Vocontii

The Vocontii were a Gallic people who lived on the east bank of the Rhône.
Location.
Their main towns were Lucus Augusti (modern Luc-en-Diois) and Vasio (modern Vaison-la-Romaine), but they occupied an extensive territory stretching from Vercors in the north, the buttresses of Mont Ventoux in the south-west, Manosque in the south-east and Embrun in the east. Their territory was therefore distributed over five current départements of France (Drôme, Isère, Hautes-Alpes, Alpes de Haute-Provence, Vaucluse).
History.
During the 4th century BCE, the Celtic Vocontii became settled there, with an oppidum south of modern Vaison (Garcia p. 168); this seems to have been used to control trade between the Rhône and Durance rivers (Meffre). 
The earliest historical mention of the Vocontii is from 218 BCE, the crossing of the Alps by Hannibal, as recounted in Livy (Ab Urbe Condita, 21.31):
The Vocontii became Romanized between 125 and 118 BCE, at the time of the conquest of the province of Gallia Narbonensis. During the 1st century BCE, the Vocontii signed a treaty of friendship ("foedus") with Rome; this enabled them to keep a certain autonomy and their traditional institutions (Peck). One thus finds a praetor and a senate leading the city of Vaison, assisted by praefecti sent to the surrounding districts ("pagi"), which are advised by local assemblies ("vigintiviri"). Public municipal officials and slaves supplement this administrative flow chart.
The Vocontii are mentioned by Caesar (Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 1.10):
their location and borders are described in two passages by Strabo, writing in the first few decades of the 1st century CE. (Geographica, 4.1)
The Vocontii are later mentioned by Tacitus (Historiae, Book I Chapter 66: Revolt of Vitellius), which took place in 69 CE:
Between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, the towns of Gap, Sisteron and Vaison-la-Romaine became independent of the Vocontii, whose territory was now centered on the valley of the Drôme, with Dea (modern Die) their new capital. This city, which was honoured with the status of colony, was fortified by a rampart in later Antiquity and became the seat of a bishop in 325. Audentius, bishop of Die in the 5th century, carried the title of bishop of Voconces.
Military unit.
A 500-strong auxiliary cavalry unit, the "Ala Augusta Vocontiorum civium Romanorum", was raised among the Vocontii. The troopers were Roman citizens. After service in Germania Inferior, from 122 it served at Trimontium, a mixed cavalry and infantry fort near Newstead, Scottish Borders. The unit is known by an inscription, (RIB 2121):
and by two military diplomas, dated 122 and 126; the former from Brigetio in Pannonia (CIL XVI, 65) and the latter from Britannia (AE 1997.1779a).

Greywell

Greywell is a small village and civil parish in Hampshire, England.
Greywell village is a past winner of the Best Kept Village in Hampshire competition and a recent winner of Best Small Village in Hampshire. The Basingstoke Canal runs underneath part of the village through the 1.1 km long Greywell Tunnel which is now no longer navigable due to a collapse which occurred in 1932. The eastern portal in Greywell village is the largest winter bat roost in the country, and the second largest colony of Natterer's bat in Europe. The canal originally ran from Basingstoke to join the Wey Navigation near Pyrford. However the canal is derelict towards Basingstoke and only starts being navigable a mile or so to the east of Greywell tunnel and then runs towards North Warnborough, passing the ruins of King John's castle. A short section of the canal from the western tunnel portal exists and is a nature reserve and the original towpath can be walked.
The upper reaches of the River Whitewater also run through the village.
Greywell is home to two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, with the Greywell Tunnel and its bat colony, and Greywell Moors, which lies around the River Whitewater.
Greywell is on the other side of the M3 from Hook. It is about two miles from Odiham. The area is extremely popular with walkers and cyclists.
Nearby medieval Odiham Castle is of historical interest to many.
At the centre of the village is the Fox and Goose public house.
Greywell is within the Anglican United Parish which is served by St Swithuns Nately Scures church, and St Mary's church is in the village itself.

<doc id="5987090" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987090" title="Hale, Hampshire">
Hale, Hampshire

Hale is a small village and civil parish in Hampshire, England. It lies on the border of the New Forest, overlooking the valley of the River Avon. The village is about north-east of the town of Fordingbridge, and about south of the city of Salisbury. Within the parish stands Hale House, a large 18th-century mansion which was the country house of architect Thomas Archer, who also rebuilt Hale church in 1717.
Overview.
Hale is a village to the northeast of Fordingbridge in an area of woodland, to the east of the River Avon. It is a scattered community with some thatched cottages around the green, a village hall, and a Victorian school building which still houses the primary school.
At the centre of the village is Hatchet Green, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Conservation Area. It contains various tree species including oak, ash, birch, holly, lawson cypress, chestnut and hawthorn. It was taken over by the Parish Council in 1975 because no owner could be traced.
History.
The manor of Hale does not appear in the Domesday Book of 1086. However there was a hide of land in nearby Charford held of the King by Alwi son of Torber. Alwi was also holding West Tytherley at the time of the Domesday Book, and since Richard de Cardenvill, at the beginning of the 13th century, was holding Hale and West Tytherley of the King it is possible that this Charford estate was Hale.
In the 14th century Hale passed by marriage to Sir Robert Brent of Cossington, in whose family the manor remained for about two centuries. Hale was probably sold to one of the Penruddocks in the 16th century. Thus Robert Penruddock, who died childless in 1583, evidently had a lease of the manor and was the first of the family to settle at Hale. Around this time the original mediaeval church was substantially rebuilt, and there is a brass on the floor of the church to Sir John Penruddock, who died 8 March 1600.
In 1631 the classical architect Inigo Jones was commissioned by Sir John Penruddock to remodel the medieval church or St Mary's in Hale as a Tuscan temple along the lines of St Paul's, Covent Garden. It has long been suspected that the church was Jones's, but the proof was only recently discovered by Kate Bennett in a manuscript in the Bodleian Library recording a Latin inscription in the hands of the Penruddock family attributing the church to Jones. 
Hale passed by marriage into the Gage family, until Thomas Gage, 1st Viscount Gage of Castlebar in Ireland, apparently sold the manor between 1713 and 1720 to Thomas Archer, Groom Porter to Queen Anne, who at the latter date was licensed to inclose two roads in Hale between South Charford and Woodgreen. Archer demolished the Penruddock's Elizabethan Manor House and built the Palladian style Georgian Mansion which is here today. He also altered and enlarged the church, landscaped the grounds and planted the oldest part of the Lime Avenue. Andrew Archer, 2nd Baron Archer held it before his death in 1778, his heirs being his three daughters. The May family took over in 1789, and the Goff family bought Hale in 1836.
The civil parish of Hale was formed in 1895. Until 1920, Hale was one large estate, and the village was effectively closed to outsiders, with no inn and no shops. In 1920, the estate was divided up and sold in lots. Hale House and its surrounding park still survives as the nucleus of the old estate.
Hale Park.
To the west of Hale is Hale Park, home to a Palladian style Georgian Mansion, built by Thomas Archer around 1715 and added to over the years. The village church is to the north-west of the house. It is dedicated to Saint Mary. It is mostly 18th-century in date, but with its 17th-century nave and chancel retained. The house is now owned by Mr Patrick Hickman . He purchased the house and grounds in 1974
Hale Purlieu.
Next to Hale is the National Trust common of Hale Purlieu. Hale Purlieu is an area of heath and valley bog with typical flora and fauna. It was for centuries outside of the New Forest - the word "purlieu" means an area which has been "disafforested" and is not subject to forest law. It was brought within the boundary and the Verderers' jurisdiction under the New Forest Act of 1964.

Remo Fernandes

Luís Remo de Maria Bernardo Fernandes, more popularly known as Remo Fernandes (born 8 May 1953), is a pop/rock/Indian fusion artist and film playback singer from the state of Goa, India. His musical work is a fusion of many different cultures and styles he's been exposed to as a child in Goa and in his later travels around the world. Such influences include Goan and Portuguese music, Sega music from Mauritius and Seychelles, African music, Latin music from Spain and South America, the music of erstwhile European communist states, those of the dancehalls from Jamaica and Soca from Trinidad. Writing and singing songs in English made his success more rare and distinctive in the context of the Bollywood-dominated, Hindi language-based, occasionally even disco music scene that was popular in the 1980s and 1990s. His compositions in English, reflecting life and socio-political happenings in India with which every Indian could identify, became popular largely with the growing, English-educated, Indian middle class. His Hindi pop/rock and film songs became instant hits with the Indian masses, earning him Gold, Platinum and Double Platinum Discs. A popular stage performer in India, he has also taken part in many music festivals around the world. He has performed with international names such as Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin and Queen, to name a few. Recently he signed up as a member of the AAP, a political party in India, for Goa constituency.
He now writes and sings his songs in five different languages: English, Hindi, French, Portuguese and Konkani.
Early years and musical influences.
Remo Fernandes was born to the well-known Panjim family of Bernardo and Luiza Fernandes on 8 May 1953. Although brought up in a Catholic family, Remo says 'When I turned 18, I started thinking for myself; and I realised that god is beyond religion.' Remo's first introduction to rock was at the age of seven, when a cousin returned from London with "Rock Around The Clock", a record by Bill Haley & His Comets. He claims that it changed his life forever. He spent the next decade listening to music of that era's most popular icons:
In school Remo developed natural guitar playing skills and along with a talented group of friends, Alexandre Rosario, Tony Godinho, and Caetano Abreu, formed a school band named the "The Beat 4". He wrote his first songs around this time, at age 14, winning 1st prizes in all-Goa competitions for best composer, best vocalist, and best lead guitarist. After graduating from school Remo went on to earn a Bachelor's degree in Architecture from the city of Bombay (now called Mumbai). His love affair with music continued, often bunking classes to work on his technique, when he figured out a way to tune and play the guitar to make it sound like the Indian sitar. He continued writing his own songs, playing solo or playing with different bands including one of India's top most recording artists, 'The Savages'.
Mumbai being one of the few cities in India at the time with a niche audience for Rock Music, he played in concerts and venues such as Shanmukhnanda Hall, Rang Bhavan, and in all the major college campuses of Bombay. While most young Indian musicians were happy sounding exactly like their American heroes, Remo brought an Indian element to his music with his Sitar/Guitar, and taught himself to play the Indian flute.
After graduation, Remo returned to Goa and immersed himself in its once famous Hippie culture. He met a group of travelling European artists who named themselves the Amsterdam Balloon Company, playing at their full moon concerts at Baga. Much later, Remo would team up in Amsterdam with Lucas Amor, the violinist in this group, and cut a song called "Venus and the Moon".
Between 1977 and 1980, Remo travelled in Europe and North Africa, hitch-hiking around eight countries during a span of two-and-a-half years, supporting his travels by singing and passing a hat around in underground stations and pedestrian streets.
He performed in shows with fusion rock bands, such as "Rock Synergie" in Paris. Almost settling in the West for good, he changed his mind and returned to Goa on Christmas Day, 1979. "Traveling and living abroad made me see clearly where Home really was" he says.
Pre-fame years.
After returning, Remo wrote some of his most memorable socio-political songs about life in Goa and India, but had to face rejections from Indian record companies, who believed that there was no market for English music in the country. Besides, in 1980s, there was no air play on radio and television, they were both monopolised by the government, who seem to refuse to accept pop and rock music's existence.
"But I knew the record companies were wrong" Remo said. So he recorded his maiden album "Goan Crazy" and a subsequent album "Old Goan Gold" on a four-track cassette TEAC Portastudio recorder in his home. In these albums he played all the instruments, sang all voices, and was the only composer of its music and lyrics. He engineered the recording and mixing and designed the album covers. He had cassettes produced in Bombay and personally went about distributing the cassettes from shop to shop in Goa on a yellow scooter along with an illustrated book of poems he wrote, and postcards and t-shirts he designed.
1986 was a turning point in his career when three things happened. The first was being invited to play at an official government function in Goa for the then visiting Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. There he sang a song titled 'Hello Rajiv Gandhi' causing a controversy in the local press and then in the national one. But Remo mailed these critical press clippings to the Prime Minister, who immediately replied saying he and his wife Sonia loved the song, and found nothing objectionable in it. This letter, written by the young new Prime Minister of a hitherto conservative country to a pop/rock musician, together with the whole story in pictures, spread like wild fire and was carried in countless publications all over India.
The second significant happening that year was Remo's singing in Bombay at a concert called "Aid Bhopal", held to raise funds for victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy, in which he sang two of his songs, 'Pack that Smack' and 'Ode to Graham Bell'. To his surprise, both his songs were televised by Doordarshan, the single TV channel in India, on four successive Sundays at prime time. In a country with just one monopolistic Government owned and run TV channel at the time, that was tremendous exposure.
His wife Sonia also had family influences in the music industry like her cousin Nina (formerly Naina Fernandes), who toured with many Rock and Roll bands in the 50s/60s one of them was the famous Rolling Stones. Nina in her younger years had worked with many music artists in the industry, however in the 70s she decides to settled down in a married life with her then husband Raman Ghosh and they later had a baby girl. Nina has since moved on to new ventures with a new life and now resides in the UK with her only daughter.
The third happening was composing and performing the title song for the hit movie Jalwa, which was released the next year. This last event made him instantly famous due to the popularity of Bollywood cinema and of the Hindi language. Remo's "'Jalwa' was path-breaking; it was a 15-minute piece of creative high-energy improvisation, featuring vocal scatting and a style of Indian flute playing which singers, musicians and music directors in India copy and emulate to this day.
Career.
After breaking out with his first hit album "Pack That Smack" in 1986 and "Bombay City" the next year, he became the highest-selling English rock musician in India and the only one in the country to be awarded Gold Discs in this category. ""Pack That Smack"" became his first album to be released by a national record company, CBS. This was an anti-drugs themed album, especially against addiction to Heroin which contained songs such as "Down with Brown", "Just a Hippie", as well as socio-political satire such as "Mr Minister" – a nursery rhyme-styled song on politician who went to sleep once elected to power; and "So Wie Du" – a recording of an award-winning live performance. "Bombay City" contained hits such as "Ocean Queen", "Against you/Against me", and a hilarious take on the condition of telephone services in India, "Ode to Graham Bell".
Around this time, invited to attend international music festivals and concerts, Remo again started travelling around the world. His first international event was at the Dresden International Song Competition in former East Germany that attracted competitors from socialist and communist countries. There he won three awards, the Press Critics Award, the Audience Favorite Award, and the overall Second Prize. He once represented India, when it was invited, in the Tokyo Music Festival. He also took part in the Festival of India in the USSR, the MIDEM '96 Music Festival in Hong Kong, besides Festivals in Germany, Bulgaria, Macau, Seychelles and Mauritius. As a stage performer he has by now been to every continent around the world.
Although his now legendary composition "Jalwa" of the 1987 hit film made him instantly famous in India, he resisted the urge to join the commercial Hindi film music industry full-time, as he felt that he would have to compromise his artistic values by doing so, and he felt that his main body of work ought to be his own songs written out of his own personal experiences, not songs commissioned for film situations.
The next album he released in 1992 with Magnasound was titled "Politicians don't know to Rock'n'Roll". Released in the backdrop of communal violence spreading in India, terrible events such as the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and the destruction of the Babri Masjid mosque in Ayodhya, the album expressed the political tension of the time. It included songs such as "Don't kick up the Rao" – about the then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, "A song for India", "How does it feel?" and a song about safe sex titled "Everybody wants to".
In 1995, Remo Fernandes finally moved into Hindi Pop and film music to become a playback singer, by teaming up with the legendary director Mani Ratnam and composer A. R. Rahman. He sang the song "Humma Humma" in the Hindi film Bombay. The song went on to earn Remo a Double Platinum.
"Huya Ho" was the next hit he composed for the film "" which was released in 1996.
In 1998, along with his newly formed band called the "Microwave Papadums", he released his first and only Hindi pop/rock album to date titled "O, Meri Munni"(). It went to the top of all the charts, and brought in another Platinum Album.
In 2000 Remo became the first Indian solo artist to have a song officially released solely on the Internet. "Cyber Viber" generated 16,000 downloads in 2 weeks. Other artists in India who also released top hit songs on the Internet that same year were both Mumbai based bands, Pentagram & Dementra.
Other collaborations and work.
In 1995, during the Channel V Music Awards, Remo, on a bass guitar, and Roger Taylor, on drums, played with Led Zeppelin band members, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.
When Pepsi USA entered Indian markets in the 1990s as "Leher Pepsi", they signed up Remo for an endorsement deal and got him to star in their first two launch ad films, making advertising history in India.
In February 2005, Remo collaborated with Jethro Tull along with renowned Indian percussionist Sivamani, for a concert held in Dubai. They performed tracks such as Mother Goose, Locomotive Breath, and Remo's now very famous Flute Kick also informally called ""the flute song"". Jethro Tull also backed Remo as he sang his own 'Bombay City' and 'Maria Pita Che'.
Until recently, Remo has participated in, and helped popularise a local festival called the "Siolim Zagor".
In 2001, three Microwave Papadums band members- Dharamedra Hirve, Selwyn Pereira and Victor Alvares, and Remo's personal assistant Sunil Redkar, were killed in a motorvehicle road accident in Kanpur, on the way to the airport after a particularly spectacular concert there. Remo was devastated and stayed away from music and performances for a year.
In 2002 Remo released two albums which, once again, were very much ahead of their time for India. The music was contemplative, orchestral, complex. The album were "India Beyond" and "Symphonic Chants". Tracks from "India Beyond" were signed to and released by Buddha Bar, Paris, France, and Opium Garden, Miami, USA. In India these albums went unnoticed, as neither record companies nor the media knew what to make of them.
In 2003, on his 50th birthday, Remo held a reunion concert in Goa with many of his former bands; The Beat 4, Indiana, and The Savages, besides friends like The Valadares Sisters and Lucio Miranda. It was a 4-hour unforgettable concert attended by 25,000 people from ages 8 to 80.
The last album Remo released through a record company in India was "Muchacha Latina". For the title song he scripted, directed and edited the music video. The music scene in India had began to change once more, though, and all attention was now given to Bollywood music. Former pop/rock artists were now composing and performing exclusively for the celluloid world. Record companies simply did nothing to invest in the promotion of non-film music, which they called 'private' albums.
From then on, Remo made songs which were closest to his heart right from the start: socio-political comments and critiques, exposing corruption, communalism and other evils in India, and motivating people against them. These songs he distributed on the Internet for free, together with their music videos once again scripted, directed and edited by himself. The most memorable of these are "India, I Cry", "India Against Corruption", and "Vote: Tit for Tat".
In 2011 Remo was approached by the Election Commission of India to be their 'Youth Icon for Ethical Voting' in Goa, and billboards with Remo's pictures and messages were put up all over the state. "Vote: Tit for Tat" was composed specially to encourage the Goan people to vote out blatantly corrupt ministers with official criminal records who had been ruling the roost in the Goa Government for decades. The video went viral on YouTube, and the election results were unprecedented; Goa had the highest voter turnout ever, the highest voter turnout in youth aged 18–25 years, and 90% of the aforementioned criminal ministers were voted out of power.
In 2011 Remo also produced and sang a song for a new film by Bejoy Nambiar of the 2010 hit film 'Shaitan', titled 'David'. It is slated for release in early 2013.
Remo is presently working on three personal albums, one of them being a re-recording of his very first 'Goan Crazy!'. He says: "A 4-track Portastudio recording was OK in Goa in 1984, but I'd like this album, my first, to be remembered in today's state-of-the-art quality."
He also recently gave his tunes and voice to the title track of Luv U soniyo which released July 26, 2013.
Personal life.

Lake Leschenaultia

Lake Leschenaultia, Western Australia is a former railway dam that is now a recreational lake in the Shire of Mundaring just north of the location of an important railway stopping place on the original Eastern Railway. The dam holds approximately 520 million litres of water.
Location.
It is located off Rosedale Road in Chidlow, about 45 minutes from Perth by car in the Perth Hills.
History.
Lake Leschenaultia is a man-made lake constructed c.1897 as key infrastructure for the Western Australian Government Railways. It is the largest reservoir constructed on the Eastern Railway line and supplied water to steam trains for almost 50 years. Since 1949 it has been used as a recreation area for both locals, interstate and overseas visitors. Many locals learned to swim at the Lake, especially before the 1960s when there were no public swimming pools available locally. In 2005, Lake Leschenaultia gained a heritage listing based on the railway history, recreational significance and other factors. In 2006, the 40m timber jetty (constructed in 1971) was removed due to safety issues and has since been replaced with a pontoon. Since early in 2007, Lake Leschenaultia has been the venue for the monthly local market.
Attractions and facilities.
The recreational area adjoining the lake is managed by the Shire of Mundaring, which currently does not charge an entry fee (January 2013). However, costs apply for camping, canoe hire and picnic area hire. It is advertised as offering a number of attractions, including picnics and camping; physical activities such as bushwalking, canoeing and swimming; and views of native flora and fauna, such as birdwatching. Facilities provided include a café, kiosk, toilets, playground, barbecues, picnic areas, grassed areas, camp ground with camp kitchen and walking and cycling trails. No dogs or fishing are allowed.

John Fortescue of Salden

Sir John Fortescue (ca. 1531 or 153323 December 1607) of Salden Manor, near Mursley, Buckinghamshire, was the seventh Chancellor of the Exchequer of England, serving from 1589 until 1603.
He was the son of Adrian Fortescue and his wife Anne. Fortescue had six children with his first wife, and a seventh with his second wife after the death of his first wife. Many of his children followed his path in politics, holding positions in Parliament. His father Adrian Fortescue was martyred and has been beatified.
He led a largely undistinguished career in Parliament prior to his accession to the chancellorship, serving in several districts (including for Wallingford), and he continued to serve in Parliament after losing that title. Fortescue also held the position of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1601 to his death. Fortescue served under Queen Elizabeth I and was knighted in 1592. When King James I came to the throne in 1603, Fortescue advocated restrictions on his power, in part in order to limit the appointment of Scottish people. These reforms were not implemented, and as a result, James dismissed him from his position as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He retained, however, his position in Parliament and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as well as the keeper of the wardrobe.
Fortescue was buried in Mursley Church in Buckinghamshire, England, where a monument has been erected in his honour.

Hurstbourne Tarrant

Hurstbourne Tarrant is a village in Hampshire, England. It lies to the north of the county in the Test Valley.
The Tarrant part of the name originates from 1226, when the village was given to the Cistercian Tarrant nunnery.
During the Second World War, Hurstbourne Tarrant was the decoy site for RAF Andover, the headquarters of RAF Maintenance Command. This was one of four airfields in Hampshire to be given a decoy site in 1940, to deceive enemy aircraft into attacking a spurious target. The decoy site at Hurstbourne Tarrant was a type 'K' decoy site with fake aircraft and buildings. From September 1940, fake machine gun posts were added to Hurstbourne Tarrant.
The famous Victorian, Edwardian artist, the American, Anna Lea Merritt, lived in the village for many years.
Hurstbourne House.
Hurstbourne House is a grade II listed late 17th-century country house at the edge of the village. It was renovated in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The original central range was built in two storeys, and has 19th century 3-storey cross wings at each end. The walls are stucco rendered and the roof tiled. The frontage has 3 bays, the central one recessed.

Independent Socialist Party (Netherlands)

The Independent Socialist Party (in Dutch: "Onafhankelijke Socialistische Partij"; OSP) was a revolutionary socialist political party in the Netherlands.
History.
The party was founded by a group around Jacques de Kadt and Piet J. Schmidt on March 28, 1932. The group had split from the SDAP after a conflict over the internal opposition publication, the "De Fakkel". The moderate leadership of the SDAP banned the publication, in reaction to this the leftwing opposition left the party. It entered in the 1933 elections where at won 27,000 votes and nearly one seat. In 1935 the party merged with the Revolutionary Socialist Party, and formed the Revolutionary Socialist Workers Party.
Ideology & Issues.
The OSP was an orthodox Marxist, revolutionary socialist party, which opposed both the authoritarian stalinism of the Communist Party of the Netherlands and the moderate reformism of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party. The party's main goal was the proletarian world revolution, which would replace the capitalist system by a system of workers' councils. In the end this would result in a Communist society where inequality, exploitation and class would be eliminated.
Electorate.
The RSP was mainly supported by leftwing intellectuals and educated workers, who were highly concentrated in the large cities.
Organization.
Linked organisations.
The party had a strong basis of young militants, united in Socialist Youth Union. (Dutch: "Socialistische Jeugd Vereniging"; SJV). The party magazine was the "De Fakkel" (The Torch), which had actually ignited the break between OSP and SDAP. The Youth Union was affiliated to the International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations.
Relationships to other parties.
The OSP was shunned by other leftwing parties, because of its strong opposition to the social-democratic SDAP and the Communist CPH. Cooperation with the small Left-Communist RSP led to their merger with the RSAP in 1935.
International Comparison.
The OSP is very comparable to other parties formed as orthodox Marxist opposition within social-democratic parties, like Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany - see anti-Stalinist left and centrist Marxism.

Les deux journées

"Les deux journées, ou Le porteur d'eau" ("The Two Days, or The Water Carrier") is an opera in three acts by Luigi Cherubini with a libretto by Jean-Nicolas Bouilly. It takes the form of an opéra comique, meaning not that the subject matter is humorous, but that the piece is a mixture of spoken dialogue and musical numbers. Bouilly claimed he took the story from a real life incident during the French Revolution but, for fear of censorship, he moved the action back to 1647 and the time of Cardinal Mazarin. The opera was first performed on 16 January 1800 at the Théâtre Feydeau in Paris.
"Les deux journées" is sometimes considered Cherubini's most successful opera, though revivals have been rare in the past hundred years. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Ludwig van Beethoven both felt that Bouilly's libretto was one of the best of its day; Beethoven kept Cherubini's score on his desk and copied out passages from it while composing "Fidelio".
Synopsis.
Act 1.
"Mikeli's home"
Mikeli is a Savoyard water carrier living in Paris. Mikeli's son, Antonio, tells how as a child his life was saved by an unknown Frenchman. He is interrupted when Count Armand, a member of the French parliament, enters with his wife, Constance, begging Mikeli to save him from Cardinal Mazarin's soldiers. Mikeli willingly offers his assistance. He tells Armand that Antonio is due to be married the next day to Angelina, who lives in Gonesse. He plans to smuggle Armand and Constance out of the city, which is ringed by Mazarin's men, by disguising Constance as Antonio's sister, Marcelina, and hiding Armand in his own water cart. Antonio enters and, to his delight, recognises Armand as the Frenchman who saved him as a child.
Act 2.
"The gates of Paris"
Mazarin's soldiers are stopping passersby in their search for political fugitives. After some delay, they let Antonio and his "sister" through, but they are suspicious of Mikeli's cart. While Mikeli distracts them, Armand slips out of the cart and through the gate. Mikéli is turned back.
Act 3.
"In Gonesse" 
The villagers are preparing for Angelina and Antonio's wedding. A patrol of soldiers enter as Antonio, Armand and Constance arrive. Armand hides in a tree but gives himself up when they arrest his wife. At this point, Mikeli appears with news that the queen has offered a free pardon to all the members of parliament. All ends happily.

Belfast, Prince Edward Island

Belfast is a Canadian village located in southeastern Queens County, Prince Edward Island in the townships of Lot 57 and Lot 58.
Situated on the island's south shore along the Northumberland Strait, Belfast is predominantly an agricultural area.
History.
Belfast was the landing site of Lord Selkirk's settlers in 1803. These poor displaced Scottish farmers soon established themselves on the best land in the area and it became one of the most productive farming districts in the colony.
The Presbyterian Scots were joined in the mid-19th century by displaced Irish potato famine refugees who were forced to take poorer land in surrounding areas. Political, social and economic tensions between the Roman Catholic Irish and Presbyterian Scots boiled over during a general election in March 1847, resulting in what has become known as the Belfast Riot.
Belfast today.
Today, Belfast is known for its golf course (the "Belfast Highland Greens"), Mini Woolen Mills, and many art studios and pottery shops. 
Also of interest is the lighthouse at nearby Point Prim, which was designed by Architect Isaac Smith in 1845 and is the oldest lighthouse on the Island. The 18.2 m (60 foot) structure is also the only round brick lighthouse on PEI and one of the last of its kind in Canada. 
Of particular note is the local parish church, St. John's. Built in 1824 in the style of Sir Christopher Wren, Saint John's is today under the pastoral care of Rev. Roger W.MacPhee. In 2005, the church invited Robin Mark, a popular Christian musician from Belfast, Northern Ireland, to lead their "Emerging Church Conference." The E.C.C. was such a success that Mr. Mark returned in 2006 for "Revival in Belfast II" and is scheduled to be back in 2007 along with Pastor Paul Reid. Saint John's has the largest Presbyterian Sunday school east of Montreal.
In addition to Saint John's, Belfast is home to two other churches, namely, Saint Michael's Roman Catholic, and Wood Islands Presbyterian. Many residents of the community attend worship services in Charlottetown or Montague.
Amenities.
Belfasts major recreational component to their community include, Belfast Rec Center which includes one ice surface a community room, a canteen & skate sharpening, Belfast Highland Greens a 9-hole golf course, Belfast Community Pool which includes two outdoor pools, a kiddy pool and canteen services. A campground — Lord Selkirk Provincial Park, as well as a softball field beside the rink.
Economy.
One of the region's major employers is Northumberland Ferries, which operates a terminal in Wood Islands. This ferry service, which connects Prince Edward Island to Caribou, Nova Scotia, was first established in 1941. Two ferryboats, the M.V."Confederation" and M.V."Holiday Island", currently service the route.
Education.
Students in the area attend Belfast Consolidated School. From grade 10 through grade 12, they attend Montague Regional High School. Both schools are administered by P.E.I.'s Eastern School District.
Notable residents.
Notable "Belfasters" include former P.E.I. premier John Angus MacLean (d. 2000) as well as the members of the band Paper Lions.
Communities.
The Community of Belfast was incorporated in 1972 and contains the following localities or settlements:

<doc id="5987221" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987221" title="Shotley, Suffolk">
Shotley, Suffolk

Shotley is the parish giving its name to the Shotley peninsula south of Ipswich, between the River Stour and the River Orwell in Suffolk, England. Shotley parish comprises the village of Shotley and the larger adjacent settlement of Shotley Gate. In 2001 there were 2,373 people living in Shotley.
Shotley.
The village of Shotley is about a mile northwest from the tip of the peninsula, and lies either side of the B1456 road (the Street). There are two entries for Shotley (Scoteleia) and an adjacent settlement of Kirkton (Cherchetuna) listed in the Domesday Book of 1086.
A school is located outside the village (half of 1 km east) opposite the turning into Oldhall Road. Oldhall Road is located east of the village leading north to St Mary's Church. The church contains a naval cemetery cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
Shotley Hall is located near to the church. Rose Farm lies to the south of the village.
Shotley Parish Council holds its main meeting at the village hall at 19.00 hours every third Thursday of every month, while the Open Spaces and Amenities Committee meets most months on the second Thursday. Both are open to the public.
Shotley Gate.
Shotley Gate is a settlement to the south of the village of Shotley at the tip of the peninsula.
By about 800 AD, the Vikings or Danes started to make an appearance in this area. Under the Peace of Wedmore in 878, all land north of the old Roman Watling Street, which ran from London to Chester, was given to the Viking leader, Guthrum. Shotley therefore became part of Danelaw. The peace was short-lived however, and following an unsuccessful Viking attack on Kent, Alfred King of Wessex attacked the enemy in East Anglia.
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 885 reads as follows:
'The same year sent King Alfred a fleet from Kent into East Anglia. As soon as they came to Stourmouth, there met them sixteen ships of the pirates, and they fought with them, took all the ships and slew the men. As they returned homeward with their booty, they met a large fleet of pirates and fought with them the same day, but the Danes had the victory'.
It is possible that Bloody Point at Shotley took its name from this incident, however at that time the river entered the sea north of Felixstowe and so the area would not have been seen as the mouth of the Stour.
It could also have derived this name late in the next century when the Vikings returned to the estuary in force, twice plundering Ipswich. Shotley Gate and the parish have a strategic position for protecting the ports of Felixstowe, Harwich and Ipswich and in 1865 the Shotley Battery fortifications were established.
Shotley Gate also harbours HMS Ganges, a former Royal Navy training establishment (RNTE Shotley) for boys. The teak ship was constructed in 1821 and taken out of service in 1861. It was moved to Shotley in 1899, and by 1905 was moved ashore. The training establishment closed in 1976 and the site was subsequently sold for redevelopment. In June 2011 Babergh District Council declared the site a Conservation Area.
The HMS Ganges Museum (open Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays between Easter and the end of October, 1100 to 1700hrs) houses artefacts and memorabilia from the old shore establishment including a large collection of photographs and original documents.
Amenities and places of interest.
The Rose public house is situated in the village of Shotley. The Bristol Arms public house lies in Shotley Gate near the piers and Martello towers. The Shipwreck public house is located at Shotley Marina, also in Shotley Gate at the end of King Edward VII Drive - a popular tourist destination.
In the summer months a foot and cycle ferry service licensed to carry up to 12 passengers operates between Shotley Marina, Harwich and Felixstowe.
There are a number of listed buildings located in Shotley, including Martello towers and the ceremonial mast from the former HMS Ganges. Shotley Cottage (half of 1 km southeast of the village of Shotley) was a WWI radio telegraphy station. The Suffolk Historic Environment Record lists more than 200 sites and monuments in Shotley.
St Mary's Church Walking Club, Shotley, meets on the second Sunday of every month.
Current issues.
Coastal footpath erosion.
In 2008 the collapse of a section of the footpath which runs along the base of Shotley Cliff (which was subsequently reinstated by Shotley Parish Council) drew attention to a coastal erosion issue affecting a lengthy exposed section of the cliff further along, where the path had already crumbled away. It became apparent that the cliff was eroding at a rate not previously recognized, which was likely to endanger several properties above it.
A group of local residents in Shotley Gate, informally known as the Shotley Stour Footpath Renovation Group, began a long term project to deal with the issue, which eventually led to the Group (with assistance from the Parish Council) obtaining funding for sea defences to protect the first of the exposed area from a number of sources including Suffolk County Council, the Environment Agency, the Haven Gateway Partnership, Hutchison Ports, Suffolk Coasts & Heaths and Shotley Parish Council, as well as local fundraising; in total, these defences (which were installed by Welham Plant Ltd under the project management of the Stour Footpath Group and Hawes Associates) cost just under £40,000 to install, with a further £60,000 subsequently raised for defences along the remaining of exposed cliff and for the renovation of a derelict picnic area at the other end of the footpath, both hopefully to be completed in 2011 (£18,000 of this funding came as a result of the Shotley project winning the Haven Gateway Authority's 'I Love Landscapes' competition in May 2011, the project receiving 1413 votes from the public).
Phase two of the sea defence work began on 11 July 2011, extending the defences to the far end of Shotley Cliff and creating a maintenance path to the rear of them which effectively links the remains of two public footpaths to create a continuous coastal path (albeit one which in "theory" is not a 'public footpath' for the entirety of its length). The sea defences, as well as the newly renovated Shotley Gate Picnic Area at the other end of the footpath, were formally opened by Tim Yeo MP on the morning of September 19, 2011, an event which was also broadcast on BBC Radio Suffolk. The project has been written up by the Estuaries Officer and Suffolk County Council as a case study in inter-agency cooperation with the public. Most of Shotley Cliff and fifty acres of foreshore, including the land on which the sea defences sit, was purchased by Shotley Parish Council late in 2012, and the Council now has responsibility for ongoing maintenance and management of the area.
The public footpath (The Stour and Orwell Walk) between Shotley Gate and Pin Mill is currently closed off by Suffolk County Council from about 2 km north of Shotley Gate marina (where it branches to Church End) as far as the Orwell Cottages near Colton Creek until mid August 2014 as a result of recent tidal surge which caused significant erosion. No alternative route is available.
HMS Ganges site redevelopment.
The attempted development of the former HMS Ganges site has caused considerable controversy in the area over several years. The scale of the proposed development was felt by residents in both Shotley and other villages along the B1456 to be in excess of what the local infrastructure could cope with. In November 2010 planning permissions on the site lapsed following an unsuccessful appeal by the developer. The mast which stands in what was formerly the parade ground is currently due for repair.
The HMS Ganges site remains undeveloped and its future is uncertain. In April 2012 the developers submitted a revised proposal for 285 homes, a 60-bed nursing home, a hotel, offices, shops and community facilities.

Percival Provost

The Percival P.56 Provost was a British "ab initio" trainer that was developed for the Royal Air Force in the 1950s as a replacement for the Percival Prentice. It was a low-wing, monoplane with a fixed, tailwheel undercarriage and had an unusual side-by-side seating arrangement. The Provost has the distinction of being the last piston-engine basic trainer aircraft to be operated by the RAF.
The Provost was later adapted to make use of a turbojet engine, producing the BAC Jet Provost. The type was withdrawn in the 1960s, in favour of its jet-powered successor.
Development.
The Provost was designed to Air Ministry specification T.16/48 for a single-engined basic trainer aircraft to meet Operational Requirement 257 for a Percival Prentice replacement. The specification was issued on 11 September 1948 and the ministry received over 30 proposals for consideration. Two designs were chosen for prototype construction, the Handley Page H.P.R 2 and the Percival P.56. Percival was given a contract dated 13 January 1950 to build two Cheetah powered prototypes. The company also built a third prototype with an Alvis Leonides Mk 25 engine.
The Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah powered prototype serial number "WE522" first flew on 24 February 1950. After evaluation against the H.P.R 2 at Boscombe Down the Leonides powered P.56 was selected for production as the Provost T.1, with an initial order for 200 aircraft being placed on 29 May 1951. Production ended in 1956 when 461 aircraft had been completed. The Percival Provost eventually formed the basis for the Jet Provost trainer which replaced it in RAF service.
Design.
The Provost was an all-metal single-engined two-seat monoplane, it had fixed conventional landing gear with a fully castoring tailwheel. Production aircraft were powered by a single Alvis Leonides 25 radial piston engine, the Provost was twice as powerful as the preceding Percival Prentice. In terms of flying performance, the Provost had a roll rate and handling similar to the best fighters upon entering service, it was also known for its rapid rate of climb and generous power provision from its engine. The type was designed to be easy to maintain, various components are intentionally interchangeable where possible and there was a generous provision of access hatches across the fuselage.
The Provost was developed in order to provide training better suited to the increasingly complicated operational aircraft that were then being brought into service. To suit the training mission, the two seats in the cockpit were side-by-side so that the instructor could be alongside their student for close observation and to demonstrate flight procedures; a third seat had been specified for an observer, but this was later omitted following little use. The three-piece canopy was designed for good crash-worthiness qualities and to facilitate blind flying training in daylight via extendable amber screens and blue-tinted goggles to restrict the pupil's forward vision; the cockpit was also equipped with various approach aids to enable operations in a greater range of weather conditions and to undertake night training. The complexity of the cockpit was a deliberate choice, contrary to earlier trainer aircraft which were simplified so students would find it easy to fly, the Provost was designed so that beginners were exposed to an advanced environment more akin to the varied tasks of aircraft operations.
Operational history.
The Provost entered service with the RAF in 1953 with the first batch of aircraft delivered to the Central Flying School (CFS) at RAF South Cerney. The CFS carried out intensive flight trials in May and June 1953 before instructor training commenced. The Provost was more capable than the Prentice it replaced which allowed the students to move straight on to the De Havilland Vampire after training on the Provost. On 1 July 1953 6 Flying Training School at RAF Ternhill started to re-equip with the Provost. The first pupil training course to use the Provost started in October 1953. No. 22 Flying Training School at RAF Syerston was the next to convert and it was followed by 2 FTS at RAF Cluntoe, Northern Ireland, 3 FTS at RAF Feltwell and then the Royal Air Force College at RAF Cranwell.
From 1956 the Provost was issued to some University Air Squadrons, with the first being the Queen's University Air Squadron, Belfast in January 1956. The last RAF production aircraft was delivered in April 1956. The aircraft served with the RAF until the early 1960s, when it was replaced by the Jet Provost. A few Provosts continued in service during the 1960s with the Central Navigation & Control School (later Central Air Traffic Control School) at RAF Shawbury until the last example was retired in 1969. Several retired airframes were renumbered with maintenance serials and used for training of airframe and engine tradesmen. At least five Percival Provost have survived as civilian aircraft.
Exports.
The first export order was placed in May 1953 by Southern Rhodesia for four T.1 aircraft which were designated the T.51. Later the Royal Rhodesian Air Force followed with an order for twelve armed trainers designated the T.52 which were delivered in 1955.
In January 1954 the Irish Air Corps ordered four T.51 aircraft and in 1960 a further order for six armed T.53 variants. The Burmese Air Force also ordered 12 armed T.53 variants in 1954 and eventually operated 40 aircraft.
In May 1957 the newly formed Sudan Air Force ordered four T.53 armed variant, two were lost in accidents shortly after delivery, a further three were bought in 1959 followed by five former RAF aircraft.
Former RAF aircraft were delivered to Royal Air Force of Oman as armed T.52 variants. In 1955 the Royal Iraqi Air Force ordered 15 armed Provost T.53s with the first delivered in May 1955. The final export customer was the Royal Malaysian Air Force who obtained 24 T.51 trainers between 1961 and 1968.
In 1968 Rhodesia obtained further aircraft using a convoluted route to get around an arms embarago.

Multimedia search

Multimedia search enables information search using queries in multiple data types including text and other multimedia formats.
Multimedia search can be implemented through multimodal search interfaces, i.e., interfaces that allow to submit search queries not only as textual requests, but also through other media.
We can distinguish two methodologies in multimedia search:
Metadata search.
Search is made using the layers in metadata which contain information of the content of a multimedia file. Metadata search is easier, faster and effective because instead of working with complex material, such as an audio, a video or an image, it searches using text.
There are three processes which should be done in this method:
Query by Example.
In query by example the element used to search is a multimedia content (image, audio, video). In other words, the query is a media. Often it’s used audiovisual indexing. It will be necessary to choose the criteria we are going to use for creating metadata. The process of search can be divided in three parts:
Multimedia search engine.
There are two big search families, in function of the content:
Visual search engine.
Inside this family we can distinguish two topics: image search and video search
Audio search engine.

Choromet

HRP-2M Choromet is a 35 cm tall, 1½ pound humanoid robot which is, in a sense, the younger brother of HRP-2. It runs on ART-Linux which is a hard realtime linux developed at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan. Choromet's CPU is an SH-4(SH7751R) which runs at 240 MHz and has 32 MB of Random access memory and 32 MB of Flash ROM.
Choromet is capable of a wide range of motion. It can stand on one leg, walk, and wave. It also has the ability to sit down and lie flat on its back (or face), then stand back up again (the HRP-2 model was also able to do this). 
Choromet was developed in partnership between General Robotix, Inc. and Moving Eye, Inc., Pirkus Robotics and Dai Nippon Technical Research Institute. [http://www.aist.go.jp/aist_e/latest_research/2006/20060713/20060713.html]
What differentiates Choromet from similar little humanoid robots is that it is equipped with a large number of sensors. This means that it can be programmed using feedback loops. Due to its complexity and price, Choromet is not so much a toy as a research platform.
Software modules that require real-time processing are written as plugins in C++ and the plugin-manager itself is scriptable in stackless Python (programming language). This system is similar to the software used in the HRP series humanoid robots except for the fact that it does not include CORBA.
It has a triaxial force/torque sensor each leg and accelerometer and gyro sensors in its trunk. There are no cameras on the robot at this point because initial focus is on locomotion.
Pricing is 498,750 yen and sales are restricted to Japan only. 
This price places Choromet firmly within the means of most small-budget research labs, even those labs dealing with multi-agent programs requiring the simultaneous co-ordinated use of several robots.

King's Somborne

King's Somborne is a village in Hampshire, England. The village lies on the edge of the valley of the River Test.
History.
King’s Somborne was included in the Domesday survey in 1086 when it was owned by the King in lordship and known as ‘Sunburne’. The population included 25 villagers, 8 smallholders, 2 slaves and 7 freedmen. Three mills and two churches are also noted in the survey together with land for 10 ploughs and areas of meadow land and pasture. The present church of St Peter and St Paul, part of which dates to the early 13th century, probably occupies the site of one of the original churches.
General information.
The 'Sombornes' comprise the scattered village of King's Somborne, together with the hamlets of Little Somborne, Up Somborne, and Ashley.
Between King's Somborne and the river lies John of Gaunt's Deer Park and to the south the Romans had a river crossing. King's Somborne had its own drove road used by travellers unwilling to pay the tolls on the turnpike roads to Stockbridge and the Fair. Cruck beams still survive from the 15th century flint and chalk cottages in the village. These beams were whole timbers curving from the roof to the ground. Nearby Marsh Court is built entirely of blocks of local chalk and designed by Edwin Lutyens, as was the war memorial which stands in the village. The original garden plan for Marsh Court was designed by Gertrude Jekyll. Somborne Park is the home of the Hervey-Bathurst family and Compton Manor was the home of the late Sir Thomas Sopwith of aviation fame. The cliffs at Brook are a local landmark where chalk is extracted.
At Ashley, near Farley Mount, the Normans built a large castle. At Eldon is the tiny 12th-century Church of St John the Baptist, (now redundant). The ecclesiastical Parish of Somborne with Ashley has three restored or conserved redundant churches within its boundaries.[http://www.thesombornes.org.uk/ks_church.php]
Little Somborne has the small but charming church of Saxon origin, redundant but conserved in the 1970s and now used for two services a year.
Up Somborne, a ribbon of houses among farmland, is under one mile from Little Somborne.
Kings Somborne in the Media.
The television series Worzel Gummidge was filmed partly at or near King's Somborne, as well as nearby Braishfield.

Johnson Continuation School, and Hanford Adult School. A third comprehensive state of art high school - Sierra Pacific High School opened on August 13 2009 with 217 freshman children.
HJUHSD serves the northwestern portion of Kings County, California. The schools are located in Hanford, the county seat. 
Hanford High School and Hanford West High School each serve approximately 1,700 students. Earl F. Johnson High School serves about 250 students. Hanford Adult School serves a wide variety of students through its many and varied programs.HJUHSD students attend Hanford High School, Hanford West High School or Sierra Pacific High School school based on their home address. These attendance areas were created with input from parents and other community members to create neighborhood schools and to balance student population between the schools.Sierra Pacific High School is the only HJUHSD school currently open for Intra-District transfers
History.
Hanford High School held its first classes in 1892 with one teacher, W. S. Cranmer, and an average enrollment of fourteen. In May, 1895, Hanford High School celebrated its first graduation.
Originally, the high school was located in the back of a local bank in Downtown Hanford. When more room was needed, classes were moved to a house on Elm Street before the school found its final home on Grangeville and Douty streets. 
Funded by a 1919 bond measure for $350,000 and a $30,000 sale of school property, Hanford High’s “Main Building” on Grangeville Boulevard was opened in 1921 and would be the school’s home for more than 50 years. In 1952, a new cafeteria, auto shop and metal shop were added to the school, followed by new classrooms and other facilities in 1959.
Around 1940, the student body broke the 1,000 mark. Just over 20 years later, the school population had grown to the point that a separate facility was needed.
In November 1962, voters approved a $2.5 million bond issue to build a second campus. Land was purchased on West Lacey Boulevard and construction of “West Campus” began in 1963. It opened in 1964 to freshmen, and by 1968, 1,250 9th and 10th graders were enrolled. By the late 1980s, both campuses were serving all four grades.
In 1970, Earl F. Johnson Continuation High School - named for a long-time educator who died in 1967 - was built at the north end of the Hanford High School East Campus.
In 1975, the community bid a sad farewell to historic Main Hall at the East Campus when it was demolished because it did not meet earthquake and education codes. In 1978, the district celebrated the opening of the replacement administration and library building. It was joined by a new auditorium in 1981 (later named the Stratton L. Tarvin Presentation Center for the Performing Arts in honor of a long-time administrator).
In 1980, Hanford Adult School was built on Campus Drive. In 1994, Earl F. Johnson High School was moved a few blocks south on Douty Street to a former elementary school. A $1 million modernization in 2002 expanded classroom space there.
In 1997, the district began its biggest construction project in many years: A $18 million local bond and matching state grants funded the construction of classrooms, labs, a library, a performing arts building, an event center and more to transform West Campus into Hanford West High, an independent school.
The 2001-2002 school year marked an important milestone for the 100+ year old district: Four independent high school graduations. Hanford West High’s first graduating class numbered 291. Hanford High graduated 342; Earl F. Johnson had 21 graduates and Hanford Adult school gave out 41 high school diplomas.
On August 13 2009 A third comprehensive state of art high school called Sierra Pacific High School opened with 217 freshman with some ball fields and one of the largest brand new state of art gym in Kings County. Sierra Pacific High School phase two of the high school will include additional buildings such as an administration building, a second academic building, a wrestling room, a pool an aquatics center, maintenance facilities, library and media center according to student growth and the need. Sierra Pacific High School was built because two existing comprehensive high schools Hanford High School and Hanford West High School were over their enrollment capacities. Hanford High School and Hanford West High School are each built to hold about 1,700 students, but the student population at each was approaching 2,000 students. The Board of the Hanford Joint Union High School believes it is in the best interest of all students to keep high school enrollment at or below 1,700 students each. Studies have shown that this is a size that is big enough to allow for a variety of quality academic and extra-curricular activities, but small enough to allow for the personal interactions that help drive student success that why Hanford Joint Union High School went with this way to build there high schools . For future growth, no plans have yet to determined to build any more high schools in the near future in Hanford, but as Hanford continues to grows to estimated 70,177 residents by 2020, Hanford Joint Union High School District will continue to plan ahead to best serve all students.
Academics.
Hanford High School, Hanford West High School, Sierra Pacific High School are both comprehensive high schools offering college preparatory academics and extra-curricular activities. Earl F. Johnson Continuation High School is a smaller school designed to serve students who are at risk of not succeeding in the comprehensive setting. Hanford Adult School provides a variety of adult education opportunities for the community, including vocational training, a nursing education program and English as a second language courses.

Silver Wings (service organization)

Silver Wings is a student, professional organization dedicated to developing civilians' leadership skills and providing service to their community. Each chapter consists of college (undergraduate through graduate) students at different universities who volunteer together to help at various non-profit organizations within their community, increase professional skills through interactions with other organizations and workshops, and benefit from giving back to the community by being able to travel across the country gaining valuable leadership skills and experience in a professional/business environment. Unlike some other organizations, Silver Wings is a self-governed organization that is run by students from the chapter level all the way up to the national level. With minor supervision, Silver Wings works jointly with the Arnold Air Society (AAS) nationwide to promote leadership skills, military awareness, and professional development.
Objectives.
Mission: "Silver Wings (SW) is a national, co-ed, professional organization dedicated to creating proactive, knowledgeable, and effective civic leaders through community service and education about national defense."
Silver Wings has three tenets to help them with their mission: personal development, professional development, and civic awareness. For personal development, chapters offer projects and activities that build character through serving their community. Many chapters are involved on their campus and in their community by volunteering their time and talent to soup kitchens, nursing homes, children's museums, cleaning up parks, working on Habitat for Humanity homes and more. These activities help members develop a sense of purpose and responsibility to their community. For professional development, the national organization allows members to have leadership opportunities where they can develop their professional skills such as public speaking, written/oral communications, presenting to audiences, and planning and organizing successful projects. For civic awareness, members of Silver Wings are informed about aerospace power and its role in the United States national defense through interactions with AAS members and military personnel. Informed, members are encouraged to engage and actively promote aerospace issues in the community through educational programs, activities and voter awareness projects. Through these three tenets, Silver Wings is professional, educational, service-oriented, social and civilian.
History of Silver Wings.
Silver Wings, originally known as Angel Flight, was founded at the University of Omaha in 1952. Starting out as an all-female organization, Angel Flight was more of a national idea with various names. While these organizations across the country had different names, they were all focused on helping out their local AFROTC unit. In April 1957, representatives from 16 different groups came together at the 8th National Conclave of Arnold Air Society to join their purposes under a National Coordination Headquarters. From that point on, Silver Wings became an organization on a national, regional, and local level.
As members of Angel Flight continue to make their organization more professional, service-oriented, and an image to support members for the AFROTC unit closest to their campus, all their hard work paid off in the 1980s when the Executive Board of Directors approved for local Angel Flight chapters to use the name "Silver Wings" as recognition for their growing diversity in membership.
In 1995, the General Assembly of the yearly national conclave voted to amend Angel Flight's Constitution to officially change their name to "Angel Flight-Silver Wings." Local chapters were allowed to use the name "Angel Flight," "Silver Wings," or "Angel Flight-Silver Wings."
In hopes to increase recruitment, Angel Flight-Silver Wings went through a massive restructuring of their organization in 1996 by changing their mission and goals away from being a military-support oriented organization to further diversify their organization. Their change became official in 1998 when the National Conclave voted to officially change the name of their organization to "Silver Wings," functioning as a civilian organization focused on community service, leadership, and professional development.
Even with all the major leaps of accomplishments that Silver Wings has made in the past, some people still see Silver Wings today as second to the Arnold Air Society. This problem is recognized within all levels of both organizations and staff members of Silver Wings and AAS are working desperately to redefine the image of Silver Wings as an equal and sister organization to the Arnold Air Society.
Membership.
Entry Requirements.
Each prospective member for Silver Wings must be an undergraduate or graduate student and within the local chapter. In addition, in order to become an active member of Silver Wings, all prospective members must complete the following things:
Classes of Membership.
There are five different types of membership that a member can fall into.
Organization.
The National Headquarters provides direction and focus for the entire organization. The nation is broken up into Regions, 11 geographical areas for maximum communication and manageable administration. Region Officers serve the chapters that lie within their region and provide important communication between chapters to national officers and vice versa. 
National Headquarters is chosen each year by the National Conclave, which takes place once a year in the Spring, typically Easter weekend. The National Headquarters consists of these positions: National President, National Vice President, National Development Officer, National Public Affairs Officer, National Secretary, and National Treasurer. Extended National Staff include the National Business Chair (NBC) and National Parliamentarian, as well as the National Chief of Protocol (NCOP) and National Webmaster which are jointly sponsored by Silver Wings and the Arnold Air Society.
On the Region level, the two main leadership positions are the Region President and the Region Vice President. The Region President may choose to appoint additional officers as deemed necessary. Some suggested officer positions include: Region Treasurer, Region Development Officer, Region Secretary, Region Activities Officer. Extended Region Staff may also be selected based on each Region's bylaws and may include some or all of the following: Region Public Affairs Officer, Area/Region Chief of Protocol (ARCOP), Region Parliamentarian, Area/Region Conclave(ARCON) Co-Commander.
On the Chapter level, the main leadership positions include the President, Vice President, Development Officer, Activities Officer, Secretary, and Treasurer. The local chapter may choose to add additional positions as they think fit in order for them to complete their mission. Suggested additional officers include Public Affairs Office, Liaison Officer, and AAS-SW Chapter/Squadron Chief of Protocol (CSCOP).
Every year during the Spring (usually on Easter weekend), Silver Wings (SW) and Arnold Air Society (AAS) jointly hold the National Conclave where all members of SW and AAS are invited to discuss matters within the organizations. During this event, business meetings are conducted and local chapters and regions vote on various resolutions and amendments to their manuals. Each year during the National Conclave, both organizations vote on a Joint National Project (JNP), a project that has national appeal, a specific need, and is flexible enough so that different projects can be conducted to accomplish the JNP. Currently, the JNP for SW and AAS is "Reaching Out" a project centered around improving and aiding the lives of those with mental and physical disabilities. The SW Separate National Project (SNP) is "Education about National Defense," a stress on explaining the importance of the National Defense of the United States, specifically promoting Air Power.

Eddie Fisher (baseball)

Eddie Gene Fisher (born July 16, 1936) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a relief pitcher for the San Francisco Giants (1959–61), Chicago White Sox (1962–66 and 1972–73), Baltimore Orioles (1966–67), Cleveland Indians (1968), California Angels (1969–72) and St. Louis Cardinals (1973).
Pitching career.
Fisher led Pacific Coast League pitchers with 239 innings while playing for the Tacoma Giants in 1960. His minor league record from 1958 to 1961 was 47-28 (.627) with a 3.23 ERA in 93 games (632 innings pitched).
Fisher's best pitch was the knuckleball, and in 1963-1966 he worked out the White Sox bullpen with fellow flutterball specialist Hoyt Wilhelm.
Fisher started just 63 out of the 690 games he appeared in, and completed 7 of those, two for shutouts. He is better-known, however, for his effective relief work.
In Fisher's 15-year career, 1965 stands out as his best season. He was named to the American League All-Star team and finished 4th in the MVP voting. He led the league in WHIP (0.974), games pitched (82), and games finished (60), and was second in earned run average (2.40) and saves (24). His 15-7 record gave him a winning percentage of .682, which ranked fourth. The White Sox finished in second place that year with a record of 95-67.
He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on June 13, 1966 and helped them win the American League pennant. In 44 appearances for the O's he was 5-3 with 13 saves and a 2.64 ERA in 71.2 innings. Baltimore won the 1966 World Series, but Fisher did not appear in any of the four games against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Jim Palmer, Wally Bunker, and Dave McNally all pitched complete games, and the team needed only one relief appearance, provided by Moe Drabowsky.
Career totals include a record of 85-70 with 81 saves. In 1538.2 innings pitched he had 812 strikeouts, an ERA of 3.41, and a low 1.193 WHIP. He had a lifetime batting average of just .122 (30-for-246), but did once have three hits in a game...September 19, 1960 vs. the Chicago Cubs. He currently ranks 92nd on the MLB All-Time Games Pitched List (690) and 72nd on the MLB All-Time Games Finished List (344).

University of the City of Manila, Open University

The Open University of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, headquartered at the Gusaling Don Pepe Atienza at Intramuros, Manila, has operated a continuing education program for working adults and professionals in its partner institutions and agencies in and out of the country. It is designed to provide higher education and improved qualifications to individuals who are unable to take advantage of traditional modes of education because of personal and professional responsibilities. Open University offers undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs.
History.
The reorganization at the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM) in 1997 paved the way for the establishment of the Division of Community Health Services (DCHS), which now serves as a component of the Open University. With the Integrated Midwifery Association of the Philippines (IMAP), it pioneered a program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Community Health Service (BSCHS), a special program to qualified members and officers of IMAP that aims to upgrade their standards and quality of services. On April 16, 1998, PLM graduated its first batch of 87 midwives. Of these graduates, 39 were sponsored by Nestle Philippines.
Working with the Quality University Education for Social Transformation (QUEST), a non-government educational foundation, PLM and the Trinity University of Asia in Quezon City have already graduated more than 6,000 midwives nationwide.
Originally offering only the BCHS Program, the DCHS expanded its offerings to include the Master of Community Health Service (MCHS) in 2001. A year later, PLM by virtue of its charter, installed its General Education Curriculum (GEC) for the first two years of college education at the Second Philippine International School (SPIS), an all-Filipino educational institution for Overseas Filipino Workers in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This curriculum, permitted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Education, allows the student to pursue, in later years, courses in any discipline at PLM or in any institution for higher learning in the Philippines. Visiting assignments of PLM professors are part of the agreement between the partner schools.
In 2004, off-campus connections were established with Asia Pacific College of Advanced Studies, Southville International School and Colleges, and World CITI Colleges. In that same year, Mayor Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. of Quezon City signed a memorandum of agreement with the Open University that allows undergraduate city and barangay employees to get a college degree. To qualify, City Hall applicants should have served the local government for at least two years. Barangay employees, whether elected or appointed, must be at least high school graduates. Apart from city employees and officials, Quezon City residents are eligible to apply. Open to them are courses in business management and entrepreneurship.
At present, the distance learning programs and the off-campus program that offer a bachelor degrees in public administration remains a continuing program. It is designed to help qualified government employees get their degrees and improve their competencies as a public servant.
Admissions.
Admission to the Open University is the responsibility of the partner school or agency. Students undergo either the screening procedure set by the partner agency or institution, or take the usual Graduate Record Examination (GRE) for on-campus admission at the PLM main campus.
Classes in the off-campus at the master's level programs are held on weekends in the host or partner institution. Provision for modular instructions are provided in various programs should the student decide to complete his tertiary education.
Part of the quality control that PLM imposes is the administration of a validation test in all subjects at the end of each semester. The results of this validation test shall form part of the grade a student receives in each subject.
Degree programs.
The Open University offers degree programs in a variety of areas. These include:
Consortia.
Aside from partner schools, PLM is also engaged in partnership with companies, government agencies, organizations, and other institutions for the distance learning programs. These include:

<doc id="5987361" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987361" title="Emergency Fire Service">
Emergency Fire Service

The Emergency Fire Service (EFS) is the fire and emergency service that was operating in country areas of South Australia in the 20th century. In 1979, with the passing of the Country Fires Act in South Australian Parliament, the EFS was renamed to the SA Country Fire Service.
History.
The EFS (or now CFS) springs from a long and complex partnership between volunteers, local government and the South Australian government to meet community safety needs. The partnership began as an attempt to deal with fires in rural areas.
Also, in colonial times, government only attempted to control the outbreak of wildfire by legislating against the careless use of fire, beginning with the 1847 ordinance against reckless burn-offs or stubble and grass. Fire suppression was left to local residents who would band together to fight fires as they arose without any formal organisation or authority to set backburns. In 1913, Councils were given the right to appoint Fire Control Officers, with powers to do anything 'necessary or expedient and practicable' to prevent fires, or to protect life and property in the case of fire, or to control or extinguish a fire including backburning.
Technological expansion after the Second World War revolutionised rural firefighting with the development of radios, telephones, motor transport and the knapsack spray. Rural residents also began to form into local or district firefighting associations.
Later as part of the Second World War-effort, government-equipped volunteer Emergency Fire Service (EFS) brigades were established, at first in Adelaide, and later in some country areas. After the war, equipment from these groups was lent to District Councils for rural firefighting work. To supervise the program, an Emergency Fire Services operation was formed within the Police Department. Gradually the many local council brigades began to feel part of a statewide service.
From the mid-1950s, the EFS organisation grew stronger, and volunteers began to campaign for the EFS to be established as a statutory authority. This was achieved in 1976, with the passing of the Country Fires Act, which set up the SA Country Fire Service (CFS).
Appliances.
Many EFS vehicles were painted yellow, an unusual colour for fire services, but it was believed to be more visible in smoke. Even up to the time of the creation of the CFS in 1977 and beyond, many appliances still in use were originally World War II-vintage surplus.

2002 CONCACAF Champions' Cup

The 2002 CONCACAF Champions' Cup was the 37th edition of the annual international club football competition held in the CONCACAF region (North America, Central America and the Caribbean), the CONCACAF Champions' Cup. It featured a league format with 16 clubs. As part of the expansion, the quarterfinal stage for the current Champions Cup was moved to the first months of the 2002. Those clubs that had already qualified for the quarterfinal stage of the 2001 CONCACAF Champions' Cup were moved directly into the new league format.
To facilitate the shift to the new cycle of qualifying rounds in the latter half of one year and the league stage in the first half of the following, the decision was taken to use the current competition as the transition period and fold those clubs already qualified into the league format.
In addition, the winner and runner-up of the 2001 CONCACAF Giants Cup (Club América and D.C. United) was also merged into the first edition to provide both of those clubs the opportunity to compete for a spot in the 2003 FIFA Club World Championship, as they would have done under the previous competition system. This was convenient, as one of the qualifying MLS teams, Miami Fusion F.C., was folded after the 2001 season despite winning the MLS Supporters' Shield that year.
Club Comunicaciones,Tauro FC and Alajuelense, were elected as the top Central American non-qualifiers for the 2001 CONCACAF Champions Cup and finally the 2001 MLS Cup champions San Jose Earthquakes and the Mexican 2001 Invierno season champions Pachuca.
Originally, 4 groups of 4 teams each, to be drawn in December or January, were planned, but at the end of November, CONCACAF changed plans once again and decided to play the tournament in a two-legs knock-out format, without a group stage.
Because of this,the tournament's name was changed from CONCACAF Champions League back to CONCACAF Champions Cup.
The two finalists were supposed to qualify for the cancelled 2003 FIFA World Club Championship.
C.F. Pachuca won the tournament, their first in club history, against Monarcas Morelia in the final.
First round.
First leg and Second leg matches were played between February 3, 2002 and March 27, 2002.
Quarterfinals.
First leg and Second leg matches were played between April 14, 2002 and April 24, 2002.
Semifinals.
First leg and Second leg matches were played between August 7, 2002 and August 28, 2002.

Wisbech and Upwell Tramway

The Wisbech and Upwell Tramway was a rural standard gauge tramway in East Anglia. It was built by the Great Eastern Railway between Wisbech, Cambridgeshire and Upwell, Norfolk to carry agricultural produce. Although called a tram, in many ways it more closely resembled a conventional railway line.
History.
Its success was one of the reasons for the Light Railways Act 1896. Competition from motorised buses ended passenger services in 1927, but freight carried on until 1966 when it was cut as part of the Beeching Axe.
Originally the line used GER Class G15/LNER Class Y6 0-4-0T tram engines, which in accordance with Board of Trade regulations had sideplates and cowcatchers. These were replaced by more powerful 0-6-0T GER Class C53/LNER Class J70 and later by Drewry 0-6-0DM (Class 04) shunters. One coach survives.
For a short time in 1930-1931 two LNER Class Y10 Sentinel geared steam locomotives were used.
Route.
It ran from the Cambridgeshire town of Wisbech to the Norfolk village of Upwell. Its route carried it close to farms and villages, allowing goods to be shipped into Wisbech where they could be transferred onto the main line and carried to destinations further afield. It was this agricultural trade that caused the line to be constructed in the first place, and what kept it afloat after passenger services ceased in 1927.
Motorists passing through Wisbech along Elm High Road near to the fire station may notice a small stretch of grass and trees, this would have been the canal between Wisbech (River Nene) and the Outwell Creek. The tram however finished off this section of the canal, though Outwell and Upwell still have some of their canals left.
In fiction.
The Rev. W. Awdry drew much inspiration from the tramway for stories in his Railway Series children's books. In the book "Toby the Tram Engine" the character Toby and his coach Henrietta are introduced, both of whom are based on stock used on the tramway. Toby subsequently appeared in many more of the books and also became one of the main characters in the spin-off television series "Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends".

Organic cation transport proteins

An organic cation transport protein mediates the transport of organic cations across the cell membrane. These proteins are members of the solute carrier family, subfamily 22. This family of proteins can also transport zwitterions and anions, though it is a different subfamily of solute carrier proteins than the organic anion transporters.

Sidewinder (Hersheypark)

Sidewinder is a steel roller coaster located at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania. It is located in the Pioneer Frontier section of the park, right across from Storm Runner. While the coaster itself is a standard Vekoma Boomerang, this installation is notable because it was the first Vekoma Boomarang to use Vekoma trains (previous Boomerangs used Arrow trains). For the 2011 season, the Sidewinder's trains were replaced with Vekoma's modern trains, similar to the train on Carowinds' Carolina Cobra. This ride was also the first coaster installed in the park in 14 years since the SooperDooperLooper in 1977.
With a total of 3 loops in the ride's structure, and the fact that the ride operates in both directions, a single ride involves riders being turned upside down 6 times.
In October, when Hersheypark is decorated in a Halloween theme (Hersheypark in the Dark), Sidewinder is dubbed Scarewinder.
History.
"Sidewinder" was built on a former catering area. This moved to the area that at the time was occupied by Kaptain Kid's Kove, and became Trailblazer's catering pavilion.
Ride Experience.
The ride begins with riders being pulled backwards out of the station up a hill by a cable winch. At the top of the hill, the train is released, and speeds through the station and goes through the ride's three inversions, including a cobra roll and a vertical loop. The train goes up a second lift hill and, when it reaches the top, the lift disengages, and the train falls backwards through the inversions, pressing about 5 G's of force on riders (especially in the loop) before it returns to the station. 
It can be noted that due to the wear of the ride, riders will experience a very rough time as the train passes through the cobra roll forwards and backwards. The over-the-head restraints have been designed with special padding on the sides to prevent any injury to the neck, however it is inevitable that riders will slam their necks into the restraints during the ride.

Steve Clark (referee)

Steve Clark (born in New South Wales) is a former Australian professional referee in the National Rugby League competition.
NRL career.
Clark made his first grade debut in the match between Parramatta Eels and the Newcastle Knights, at Parramatta Stadium on 31 May 1992. In 2007 Clark reached the 300 first grade game barrier becoming only the third referee to do so. At the time of his retirement only Bill Harrigan with 393 games and Col Pearce with 343 games had refereed more matches than him.
Representative honours.
Clark made his representative refereeing debut in 1996, when he officiated the Test match between Great Britain and New Zealand.
In 2005 he controlled in his one and only City vs Country Origin match at Northpower Stadium in Gosford.
Clark made his first State of Origin appearance in 1999, refereeing two matches including the first ever drawn match in Game III. He didn't referee again until the 2005 series where he was appointed to Game II. In the following series he controlled Games II and III.
Controversy.
Steve Clark was accused by St. George Illawarra Dragons coach Nathan Brown of bias against the St. George Illawarra Dragons team in 2006, based on a perceived tendency to award dubious penalties against St. George Illawarra Dragons. Brown was subsequently fined $15000 for making these comments. An example of such a controversial penalty awarded against St. George Illawarra Dragons was in the Round 9 2008 game between Parramatta Eels and St. George Illawarra Dragons, where a 32nd minute try to Jason Nightingale was disallowed by Clark (acting as video referee) due to Matt Cooper stipping the ball. Even the referee Sean Hampstead remarked "That was a tough decision Clarky".
The Bulldogs demanded the sacking of Clark when on 15 May 2009 he disallowed a try to Jamal Idris, claiming that the Dragons Jamie Soward was impeded by Greg Eastwood of the Bulldogs. Clark was not sacked over this incident. This decision ultimately cost Bulldogs the minor premiership. At the end of the season both the Bulldogs and the Dragon were on 38 competition points apiece, with the Dragons' higher points difference allowing them to claim the title. Had the try been awarded, Bulldogs would have won the game and been on 40 competition points, with the Dragons on 36. (Note: This is after factoring an earlier unrelated ruling that saw the Bulldogs stripped of 2 points for a breach of interchange.)
Clark controversially made incorrect calls when he was one of the video referees in the 2012 semi-final played between Manly Sea Eagles and North Queensland Cowboys. The incorrect calls altered the result of the game, meaning the Cowboys were eliminated from the 2012 competition. Clark was later condemned for the decisions by his bosses and demoted from the coming weeks' games. "Full Time For Video Referees"

Meonstoke

Meonstoke is a village in Hampshire, England. Meonstoke lies in the Meon Valley where it cuts through the Middle Chalk of the South Downs. Old Winchester Hill is at the edge of the parish to the east.
It sits on the eastern bank of the River Meon. On the northern part of the western bank is Corhampton. The A32 crosses the river between the two villages, which have formed a single civil parish since 1932. On the southern part of the bank is Droxford. Soberton lies to the south of the parish, Hambledon to the east and Exton to the north.
History.
Flint implements found near Old Winchester Hill suggest that the area that is now the parish of Meonstoke was inhabited over 20,000 years ago. Later, in neolithic times a roadway developed along the South Downs, passing south of Old Winchester Hill and crossing the River Meon at Exton. There is a Neolithic stone barrow on the southern slopes of Old Winchester Hill. Also on the Hill are eight Bronze Age barrows. Old Winchester Hill is the site of one of a chain of five Iron Age forts along the South Hampshire Ridgeway. 
There are few Roman remains in the Meon Valley, but none in Meonstoke. 
The Meonwara, a Jutish tribe settled in the Meon Valley in the sixth century, but the "stoke" in the village’s name is of Anglo-Saxon origin. 
It is possible that Borough English or Ultimogeniture the tradition of inheritance by the last-born of a parent's estate, which was recorded in the village as late as 1801, began with the Meonwara. 
"Menestoche" is mentioned in The Domesday Book, with 28 heads of families listed, suggesting a possible population of 140. 
In the thirteen century, Meonstoke was granted a weekly Market, suggesting the importance of the village at the time. 
The church of St Andrew mainly dates from the 13th century, with a later tower, probably 15th century with early 20th century repairs. These included the addition in 1906 of a memorial window by Mary Lowndes, a leading light in the Arts and Crafts Movement.
A church was mentioned in the Domesday Book, but the first mention of a rector is found in 1262. Rectors of the parish have included: Thomas Chaundler, Christopher Bainbridge, Lawrence Humphrey, John Harris and Laurence Henry Woolmer.
A national school was built in the village in 1842.
The former Meon Valley Railway passed to the east of the village but the planned station and yard at Meonstoke were never built. The route is now the Meon Valley Railway Line Trail, which can be joined here.
The singer/songwriter Frank Turner comes from Meonstoke. He mentions the area in his song "To Take You Home" on the album "Love Ire & Song".

Bishad Shindhu

Bishad Shindhu () is a poetic novel about the history of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grand son Hasan, especially Husayn's assassination, and the war for the throne of Khalifa (the supreme power of Muslims). It was written by Mir Mosarraf Hussain, one of the first modern Muslim Bengali writers.
"Bishad Shindhu" was written within 1888 to 1890. It is one of the best known works of Bengali literature.
But it is not considered an authentic source for the history of Karbala, the location of Husayn's war front, and the place of his death.
"Bishad Shindhu" is written in an epic style. It contains much poetic language, and many dramatic sessions. At the time, Bengali novels were rarely written, and a few writers (including Mosarraf Hussain) were trying to establish the concept of novels in Bengali. It was written in Shadhubhasha, a Sanskritised form of Bengali.
Many Bengali Muslims view the novel as a religious book, and in rural areas, it is the most valuable book after the "Quran" and the "Hadith" which is a collection of sayings and actions of Muhammad.

All in the Family (song)

"All in the Family" is a song written and recorded by American nu metal band Korn and Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst for Korn's third studio album, "Follow the Leader". The demo version was released as a "radio teaser" shortly before the release of the album's first actual single, "Got the Life".
Music and structure.
The song is a rhyme duel between Jonathan Davis and Fred Durst, mixing elements of hip-hop beats, distorted 7-string guitars, and Fieldy's signature bass sound. The song begins with Jonathan and Fred insulting each other on hygiene, sexual orientation, family roots, and other things. At the ending, both say they will perform sexual acts on each other in an ironic way, in fact giving the song a confusing twist. There are lyrical references to each other's songs, including Limp Bizkit's "Counterfeit" and Korn's "Blind", "Shoots and Ladders", and "No Place To Hide". Parts of the riff from "Blind" can also be heard during Jon's insults. Musical acts Vanilla Ice, Hanson, and Winger are also tossed around as insults along with references to the 1993 Waco siege, Jerry Springer, Austin Powers, Raggedy Ann, Zingers, and Fruity Pebbles.
Concept.
After the song's release, Davis said in an interview, "It's just me and him ragging on each other. Some kids think that Korn and Limp Bizkit hate each other. But hey, why we would be in the same room talking to each other if we hated each other? We have total respect..." Originally, the song was for B-Real of Cypress Hill, but his record label wouldn't let him do it.
Davis and Durst would often offer suggestions for each other's lyrics; a lyric written by Durst as "tootin' on your bagpipe" was changed to "fagpipes" by Davis, who stated "I helped him bag on me better".
Media response.
In an otherwise positive review of the album, "Rolling Stone" wrote about the song:
Similarly, Steve Appleford of the "Los Angeles Times" called the song "a duet of cheap insults with Bizkit's Fred Durst that only diminishes one of Korn's strongest albums", and the "Winston-Salem Journal" wrote, "one wonders how could stumble so badly with 'All in the Family' – a scatological song crammed with crude jive and anti-gay jibes that severely undercuts an otherwise potent disc." The "Austin American-Statesman"'s critic wrote that the song's "pulsating rhythms... are undermined by countless references to guys' private parts, the f- word, 'faggots' and incest."
Mike Boehm, commenting in the "Los Angeles Times", attempted to consider the band's motivations in writing the lyrics:

<doc id="5987466" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987466" title="Nyaania Creek">
Nyaania Creek

"Nyaania was also a stopping place and locality name (31° 54′ S, 116° 06′ E) associated with the "first route" of the Eastern Railway between Bellevue and Mundaring in Western Australia"
Significance.
Nyaania Creek (31°55′S, 116°03′E) is an important tributary seasonal creek that flows into the Helena River with a catchment that moves through a number of hills suburbs just east of the Darling Scarp. Its source is in Mahogany Creek, and it flows through Glen Forrest, Darlington, and Boya before meeting the Helena River at Helena Valley.
It was originally known as the "Smiths Mill Brook" on maps between 1902 and 1920. In the 1920s it became known as "Nyaania Brook", and in 1945 it officially took the current name.
Its importance stems from the fact that it flows through private land for most of its length, linked to issues that affect watercourses in the Darling Scarp region:
It has significant areas of reserves either adjacent, or within 100 metres either side of its main creek bed. It runs in a number of places along what was rail reserve of the Eastern Railway - which is now the southern part of the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail.
Upper Reaches.
The creek is small in size and width and moves through numerous private properties.
The upper portion of the creek has the Strettle Road Reserve on its north side - which is at the west end of Mahogany Creek which although completely a regenerated plot of land following extensive firing and logging in the last hundred years is a significant reserve. 
Near the ex- Statham quarry in Glen Forrest it enters into its first reserve, the Thomas Park reserve.
In Glen Forrest the Glen Forrest Super Block is on its south side just prior to the border with Darlington and near Devil's Terror.
Devil's Terror Springs.
Historically it achieved its significance in the construction of the Eastern Railway where a surveyed route of the railway encountered difficulties with the creek and creek bed. As a cutting was being constructed (near the bottom of Dalry Rd) clay was struck followed by an underground stream which flooded the clay and turned it into a bottomless bog. 
The locality earned the name in the Perth newspapers of the 1880s as "The Devil's Terror" and they cite the example of workers sinking in mud.
That section of the railway had to be resurveyed and was shifted 100 meters south along the bed of Nyaania creek. The creek above Glen Forrest was diverted into Chittawarra Brook while a dam was thrown across the creek just to the west of Glen Forrest to hold back the water while a man made channel was built to replace the original creek bed. On completion of the channel the dam wall was breached and Nyaania Creek was allowed to run into the new channel. 
As a result of this construction the creek bed now runs along the top of the 3 to 5 meter deep cutting. In winter the water can be heard rushing just above ones head as they walk through the cutting.
For the duration of the Eastern Railway route usage (1880's to 1953) the Nyaania Creek/Eastern Railway/Devil's Terror location point of coincidence has had springs under or next to the railway line. The sleepers and rails were removed in the mid 1960s, and ever since they have subsisted even when the Nyaania Creek is dry in the middle of a drought. Many users of the subsequent Railway Reserve Heritage Trail have had a particular attraction to their persistence.
Lower Reaches.
Having passed through the built up area of Darlington it proceeds into a steep valley south of the riding school in Glen Road, and enters Helena River in Helena Valley.

In the 2000s surrounding bushland was focused as rehabilitation areas

Pennington, Hampshire

Pennington is a village in Hampshire, England. It is situated near the town of Lymington, and is in the civil parish of Lymington and Pennington. The settlement is located in the southern part of the New Forest, near the shore of the Solent.
Overview.
There are a number of shops, including a Tesco Express, One Stop Convenience Store with Post Office, a fish and chip shop, bakery, butchers, pharmacy, charity shop and a hairdresser. There are four public houses — The Wheel Inn, The Musketeers, the White Hart and the Chequers. There are three large schools, Pennington Infants and Junior, Priestlands School and a leisure centre.
History.
Pennington is now mainly a residential suburb of Lymington, but it was for centuries a separate manor. The manor is recorded as Penyton in the 12th century, and Penington in 1272. The origin of the name is not known, but it might mean "Penny Farm". The manor of Pennington was held in the 13th century by the de Clares, whose descendants continued to be overlords till it passed to the Crown following the execution of the Earl of Salisbury in 1499. At the beginning of the 14th century, John de Acton, who held the manor for a knight's fee from the de Clares, split the estate into three parts, conveying two of the parts to John Neyrnoit or Nervett, and keeping one for himself. John Nervett soon re-granted one of the parts back to John de Acton, but henceforth, the estate was generally divided into thirds. That which John Nervett owned became known, from the 16th century onwards, as the manor of Pennington Narvett.
Two mediaeval mills at Efford and Gordleston still exist as places and names. There was also a chantry chapel at Pennington, the earliest known record of which dates from 1285. The advowson of the chapel seems to have belonged to the three lords of Pennington, and the chapel was dedicated to Mary Magdalene. The last-mentioned record of the chapel shows that it survived the confiscations of 1547–8. The first parish church in Pennington, dedicated to Saint Mark, was erected in 1839. The church was replaced with the current building around 1858-60.
A Milford and Pennington Parish Council was created in 1894 and a separate Pennington Parish Council in 1911. However, in 1932, Pennington was absorbed by Lymington Borough, and it is now part of Lymington and Pennington Town Council.
With the establishment of the New Forest National Park Authority in March 2005, much of Pennington (all of Pennington Common) falls under the planning and land control of the Authority.
Pennington marshes.
To the south of Pennington lie Pennington marshes, an area of marsh and tidal muds, formerly used as salterns for the local salt industry. These are a favourite area for local birdwatchers and many different types of bird have been spotted here.

Nigâr Hanım

Nigâr Hanım (1856–1918) (نگار خانم) was an Ottoman poet, who pioneered modern Western styles in a feminine mode. She is a major figure in post-Tanzimat Turkish poetry.
Life and Poetry.
Nigâr was born in Istanbul to Macar Osman Pasha, an Ottoman nobleman of Hungarian origin. She was very well educated, first attending Kadıköy Fransız Mektebi (French School in Kadıköy), later receiving lectures at home from private teachers. She was able to speak eight different languages and play piano at a very young age.
She was married at age fourteen, but divorced after a few years of great unhappiness.
Her early poetry is in the traditional divan style, but later she was influenced by Recaizade Mahmut Ekrem and others, and adopted a more modernist stance, influenced by the Western poetry of her time. She was well versed in the cultures of East and West, and knew French, Greek, Arabic, and German.
Her book "Efsus" was the first poetry book written in Western style of poetry by a woman author. Like Mihrî Hatun, and possibly the first woman poet since her, her femininity is not hidden. Her writing style, choice of themes and presentation reflects a very feminine sensibility. Apart from poetry, she wrote prose and made several translations.
In her personal life, she was an important and well-known figure in the society of her time. Apart from her career as a poet, her life-style, outgoing personality and choice of clothing had a wide influence on society and the perspective of women at the time. Although it is not possible to say that she was a feminist, her view of woman rights was much ahead of her time.
She became increasingly isolated in the last years of her life, and was in great pain. She died 1918 in İstanbul.

Raised in Irvington, New Jersey, a suburb of Newark, Lehmann studied chemical physics and mathematics at Rutgers University's Cook College, graduating with highest honors in 1977. His undergraduate research included work in reaction dynamics with John Krenos and John Tully of Bell Laboratories, photoelectron spectroscopy with Joseph Berkowitz of Argonne National Laboratory, and raman and resonate multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopies under Professor Lionel Goodman. 
Lehmann went on to receive his doctorate in chemical physics from Harvard University in 1983, and was elected to the Harvard Society of Fellows, where he was a junior fellow until 1986. Under the direction of William Klemperer, Lehmann's graduate work involved studies of highly excited vibrational states using photoacoustic spectroscopy. During his time as a fellow, he served as a visiting scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's George Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory. There he developed with Stephen Coy the technique of microwave-detected, microwave-optical double resonance, which permits the automatic assignment of complex spectra. 
Appointed to the chemistry faculty of Princeton University in 1985, Lehmann received both the Henry and Camille Dreyfus Award for new faculty and the Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation in his first year with the university. In 1987, the university acknowledged him with the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award. He was promoted to associate professor in 1991, and to full professor in 1995, the same year he was named a fellow of the American Physical Society. He received the Thomas A. Edison Patent Award in 2002 for his work in CRDS, and in 2003, was granted the Earle K. Plyler Prize in Molecular Spectroscopy.
Lehmann left Princeton in 2005 to join the faculty of the University of Virginia, where he has continued his work in development of ultrasensitive spectroscopic methods with applications in trace gas detection, as well as studies of molecular dynamics in the gas phase and superfluid helium.

Sparsholt, Hampshire

Sparsholt (/ˈspɑːʃəʊlt/) is a village and civil parish in Hampshire, England. The village lies to the west of Winchester, and has a population of 967.
Sparsholt College, a leading land-based college and home to the BBC Radio 4 Gardeners' Question Time 'potting shed', is located on the outskirts of the village. The parish church, St. Stephen's, contains sections ranging from 12th to 19th century in age. The parish also contains the small hamlet of Dean, Farley Mount Country Park and Crab Wood SSSI. The grounds of the 17th century Lainston House (now a hotel) contain the ruins of the 12th century St. Peter's church.
Archaeological discoveries include Bronze Age bowl and disc barrows. Just west of the village is Sparsholt Roman Villa. It was constructed in phases from the 2nd to the 4th century, and then abandoned. It was excavated in 1965-72. Nothing is visible at the site today, but finds from the excavations are on display in Winchester City Museum, and one wing of the villa has been reconstructed at Butser Ancient Farm.
Today Sparsholt is served by a regular bus service (services 7 and 7A), operated by Stagecoach from Winchester Bus Station. However, the village's narrow lanes make accessibility difficult for large vehicles.
Given the relatively small size of the village, it has a very good provision of services. Within the village centre, and located within 100m of each other, there is a primary school, Church (of St. Stephen), village hall, telephone box and the small village shop with post office. This tiny building was originally the Well House of the village, holding water drawn from a wind-powered well for use by the villagers. The shop still bears the same name and its internal post office is arguably one of the smallest in the United Kingdom. In 2009 the shop was purchased by the villagers, under an industrial provident scheme, in order to safeguard its future. There is also a cricket club a quarter of a mile north of the village centre.

Hamiltonian (control theory)

The Hamiltonian of optimal control theory was developed by L. S. Pontryagin as part of his minimum principle. It was inspired by, but is distinct from, the Hamiltonian of classical mechanics. Pontryagin proved that a necessary condition for solving the optimal control problem is that the control should be chosen so as to minimize the Hamiltonian. For details see Pontryagin's minimum principle.
Notation and Problem statement.
A control formula_1 is to be chosen so as to minimize the objective function
where formula_3 is the system state, which evolves according to the state equations
and the control must satisfy the constraints
Definition of the Hamiltonian.
where formula_7 is a vector of costate variables of the same dimension as the state variables formula_3.
For information on the properties of the Hamiltonian, see Pontryagin's minimum principle.
The Hamiltonian in discrete time.
When the problem is formulated in discrete time, the Hamiltonian is defined as:
and the costate equations are
(Note that the discrete time Hamiltonian at time formula_11 involves the costate variable at time formula_12 This small detail is essential so that when we differentiate with respect to formula_13 we get a term involving formula_14 on the right hand side of the costate equations. Using a wrong convention here can lead to incorrect results, i.e. a costate equation which is not a backwards difference equation).
The Hamiltonian of control compared to the Hamiltonian of mechanics.
William Rowan Hamilton defined the Hamiltonian as a function of three variables:
where formula_16 is defined implicitly by
Hamilton then formulated his equations as
In contrast the Hamiltonian of control theory (as defined by Pontryagin) is a function of 4 variables
and the associated conditions for a maximum are
This difference is somewhat confusing, nevertheless a specific problem, such as the Brachystochrone problem, can be solved by either method. For details, see the article by Sussmann and Willems.

A Large Attendance in the Antechamber

A Large Attendance In The Antechamber is a one-man play by Brian Lipson about Francis Galton the English scientist, statistician and founder of the eugenics movement.
The play was first seen in Melbourne in 2000, and has since been performed in the UK, USA and New Zealand, both in theatres and in private homes.
Plot summary.
The play is both a philosophic discussion and a comedy, with most of the action occurring in one room in the center of the stage. Occasionally the actor climbs out of the room, and involves audience members in the performance. As the play continues, the line between the actor and the person he portrays (Brian Lipson and Francis Galton respectively) becomes blurred, until finally the single man is both.

Upper Clatford

Upper Clatford is a village in Hampshire, England. The village lies in the valley of the River Anton, several miles upstream of the point where it joins the River Test, just to the south of Andover.
Clatford is an old English term meaning 'the ford where the burdock grows'. The local parish Church of All Saints was first built probably during the reign of Henry I (1100-1135) as its massive columns and round arches are typical of the first half of the 12th century. It was rebuilt in the 16th century and transformed into an 'auditory church' in the 17th century. Even so, a large proportion of the congregation still cannot see the altar. The Church rests between two arms of the Pillhill Brook; the village war memorial is also within its grounds.
The village historically had 4 manors: Norman Court, Sackville Court, Clatford Manor and Clatford Mills.
The village is within walking distance of Andover town centre and the most direct route is to follow the path of the old railway line which is now a public footpath.
Along this route there is much evidence of the old railway line though little to be seen of the earlier canal that preceded the railway. The canal and later railway were very important to the local economy in particular for the transport of raw materials from Southampton via Andover to Upper Clatford for Taskers Iron Works whose premises were located in nearby Anna Valley. Pig Iron was shipped from Southampton via the canal to Taskers Wharf, originally located where the footpath now leaves Upper Clatford for Andover.
Local attractions are a number of traditionally thatched cottages and houses including the premises of the local public house The Crook & Shears.
Following the road south out of the village leads to the twin village of Goodworth Clatford (formerly Lower Clatford).

Dental instruments

Dental instruments are the tools that dental professionals use to provide dental treatment. They include tools to examine, manipulate, restore and remove teeth and surrounding oral structures.
Standard instruments are the instruments used to examine, restore and extract teeth and manipulate tissues.
Examination instruments.
These tools allow the dental professional to manipulate tissues for better visual access during treatment or during dental examination.
Mirror.
Dental mirrors are used by the dentist or dental auxiliary to view a mirror image of the teeth in locations of the mouth where visibility is difficult or impossible. They also are used for reflecting light onto desired surfaces, indirect vision, and with retraction of soft tissues to improve access or vision.
Local anesthesia.
About Anesthesia
Anesthesia is broken down into three main categories: local, regional, and general, all of which affect the nervous system in some way and can be administered using various methods and different medications.
Here's a basic look at each kind:
Local anesthesia. An anesthetic drug (which can be given as a shot, spray, or ointment) numbs only a small, specific area of the body (for example, a foot, hand, or patch of skin). With local anesthesia, a person is awake or sedated, depending on what is needed. Local anesthesia lasts for a short period of time and is often used for minor outpatient procedures (when patients come in for surgery and can go home that same day). For someone having outpatient surgery in a clinic or doctor's office (such as the dentist or dermatologist), this is probably the type of anesthetic used. The medicine used can numb the area during the procedure and for a short time afterwards to help control post-surgery discomfort.
Dental drills.
Dental handpieces come in many varying types which include: High speed air driven (also known as an airotor), slow speed, friction grip, surgical hand piece.
Straight handpiece with a sharp bur.
Dental laser.
A dental laser is a type of laser designed specifically for use in oral surgery or dentistry.
The use of a laser can decrease morbidity after surgery, and reduces the need for anesthetics. Because of the cauterization of tissue there will be little bleeding following soft tissue procedures, and some of the risks of alternative electrosurgery procedures are avoided.
Dental torque wrench.
A dental torque wrench or restorative torque wrench is a torque wrench used to precisely apply a specific torque to a fastener bolt for fixation of an abutment, dentures or prostetics on a dental implant.
Burs.
Dental Burs cutting surface are either made of a multifluted tungsten carbide, a diamond coated tip or a stainless steel multi fluted rosehead.
There are many different types and classifications of burs some of the most common are: the round bur (sizes ¼ to 10) or inverted cone (sizes 33½ to 90L).
Burs are also classified by the type of shank. For instance a latch type, or right angle bur is only used in the slow speed handpiece with contra-angle attachment. Long shank or shaft is only used in the slow speed when the contra-angle is not in use, and finally a friction grip bur which is a small bur used only in the high-speed handpiece.
There are many bur shapes that are utilized in various specific procedures.
Operative burs.
Flat fissure, pear-shaped, football, round, tapered, flame, chamfer, bevel, end cut,
bud bur, steel, inverted cone, diamond, brown stone, and greenstone.
Pluggers.
Pluggers are also known as amalgam condensers.
Periodontal scalers.

Upton Grey

Upton Grey is a village and civil parish in Hampshire, England.
History.
Roman times.
The village is on the line of an ancient Roman road, the Chichester to Silchester Way.
Norman times.
The Grey derives from the years when the village was owned by the de Grey family and was used to differentiate the village from the many other Uptons.
Elizabethan times.
The Manor House dates from Elizabethan times when the Matthew family lived there. The famous Elizabethan poet, George Puttenham, lived at Herriard House but also had a farm at Upton Grey. It was there that he kept his seventeen-year-old sex slave whom he had kidnapped in London. Eventually she was released when Puttenham's long suffering wife discovered her existence.
Buildings.
Manor House.
Charles Holme purchased several houses and a great deal of the surrounding land in Upton Grey. The Old Manor House, which he rented to tenants for the rest of his life, was in fragile condition. Holme then commissioned a local architect Ernest Newton to refurbish it, keeping many of the original timbers. Today's Edwardian decoration encloses oak rooms, a 16th-century staircase and original roof timbers. Newton's house was finished in 1907. Gertrude Jekyll created a four and a half acre garden around it.
Hoddington House.
Hoddington House is a Grade II* Listed mansion built around 1700 by John Limbrey. Described by Nikolaus Pevsner as ‘by far the best house’ in Upton Grey, it is built on the site of a religious house called Edyndon, a monastery affiliated to the Abbey of Beaulieu in the New Forest. It was the childhood home of George Sclater-Booth, 1st Baron Basing and his brother, the naturalist Philip Sclater.
Governance.
The village of Upton Grey is part of the civil parish of Upton Grey, and is part of the Upton Grey and the Candovers ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non-metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council.
Geography.
Upton Grey is located near to Basingstoke, which lies to the north-west. There are various other villages located in all directions around the village, including:
Village amenities.
There are various amenities in the village. These include the Upton Grey Shop and Post Office, the Hoddington Arms public house, St Mary’s Church, a village hall, a duck pond, and a war memorial to the south of the church.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator

The ARNT gene encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein that forms a complex with ligand-bound aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and is required for receptor function. The encoded protein has also been identified as the beta subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1). A t(1;12)(q21;p13) translocation, which results in a TEL-ARNT fusion protein, is associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Three alternatively spliced variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is involved in the induction of several enzymes that participate in xenobiotic metabolism. The ligand-free, cytosolic form of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor is complexed to heat shock protein 90. Binding of ligand, which includes dioxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, results in translocation of the ligand-binding subunit only to the nucleus. Induction of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism occurs through binding of the ligand-bound AhR to xenobiotic responsive elements in the promoters of genes for these enzymes.
Interactions.
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator has been shown to interact with:

Elua and His Companions

In Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Legacy saga of fantasy novels, Elua is the most important deity of Terre d'Ange. Elua's Companions are eight angels who forsook the One God to follow Elua.
The Eluine Cycle.
Elua was conceived through the blood of Yeshua ben Yosef, the son of the One God, where a spear from a soldier of Tiberium pierced his side, and the tears of the Magdalene, combined in the womb of Mother Earth herself.
While the One God mourned the loss of his son, Elua travelled the land but was reviled and rejected by most given that he was not the One God's legitimate son and as the enemy's offspring by the people of Tiberium.
In Persis he was arrested for unknown charges, but the tales of his travels had reached Heaven and eight of God's own angels, Azza, Anael, Camael, Cassiel, Eisheth, Kushiel, Naamah and Shemhazai came to free him. Naamah was the first. She went to the King of Persis and offered one night of pleasure with her in return for Elua's freedom. The King accepted and each of the Thirteen Houses of the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers have a version of this story. After, however, the King of Persis was afraid of the One God's wrath and broke his promise to Naamah. Fearing the Angels, instead of killing Elua, he gave them strong wine to drink and put him on a boat in the middle of the sea with no sails. Elua sang and dolphins brought him to shore.
Elua went to Bhodistan, and while the people of Bhodistan did not wish to turn away from their multitude of Gods, they saw the light in Elua and wished him no harm. When Elua was hungry and Mother Earth's creatures could not sustain him, Naamah would lay with strangers in the market. As such, Namaah's Servants (see Court of Night-Blooming Flowers) are near-holy figures and perform an almost sacred act. While wandering in Skaldia, Elua made friends of ravens and wolves.
They came to Terre d'Ange, a then nameless country, as the armies of Tiberium were retreating from it, during the collapse of their empire. They saw that the land that was fertile and beautiful and the people here welcomed them with open arms. Here Elua and His Companions each founded their own territories except for Cassiel, remaining loyal to the One God, and Elua whose territory was all of Terre D'Ange.
After "three-score years" the One God turned from his grieving over the death of his son Yeshua and saw what Elua and his Companions had created. "He saw that their offspring would overrun the earth", and so sent the leader of his host to summon them before him. "But blessed Elua smiled upon the leader of the One God's host and gave him the kiss of peace, laying wreathes of flowers about his neck, and the One God's commander returned ashamed and empty-handed." The One God then sent his arch-herald with an offer of forgiveness and a place next to him in heaven. Elua turned to Cassiel and borrowed his dagger. He scored the palm of his own hand and where his blood fell on the earth anemones bloomed. Elua refused saying, "My grandfather's Heaven is bloodless and I am not. Let him offer a better place, where we may love and sing and grow as we are wont, where our children and our children's children may join us, and I will go." He was told there is no such place. Then Mother Earth spoke to her once-husband and said they may create such a place together. "Thus was the creation of the true Terre d'Ange that lies beyond mortal perception, and blessed Elua and his Companions went willingly into it, passing not through the dark gate of death, but straightway through the bright gate. And alone among them, only Cassiel gazed backward in sorrow."
"For the full text of the Eluine Cycle: "
Worship.
Elua's only commandment to his followers was to "love as thou wilt". The nation of Terre d'Ange takes it as their guiding philosophy, and as such embrace all forms of love. This makes them a sexually liberated culture, accepting of homosexuality, bisexuality, and BDSM. Rape is not only a crime, because of this precept, it is the highest and most severe heresy. This includes forced intimacy as well as sexual acts with minors (generally considered under age 16 in the series) or animals as neither can make fully thought-out decisions or thereby give true consent.
Temples of Elua have no roof, only four pillars to mark the corners. The centre is unpaved. Everything, from oak trees to flowers and weeds, may grow well tended. There is usually a statue of Elua present, standing with unbound hair and an eternal smile, one hand extended in offering, the other scored with the mark of his mortality. Visitors have to walk barefoot in the temple. Elua's priests wear blue robes, no mask, and always walk barefooted as Elua did on Earth. Anemones or lilies, traditionally associated with Blessed Elua, can be offered to him. The Temple in the City of Elua has one of the oldest works of D'Angeline art and some call the large marble statue crude looking.
There is also the annual celebration of the Longest Night. This is a celebration dating to before the arrival of Elua. It is said that Elua loved the practice so much that it was adopted by Him and His Companions. For further information, see Rites and Rituals and the Midwinter Masque. Followers of Cassiel celebrate this night differently with Elua's Vigil.
Marriage.
Marriage is common practice in Terre d'Ange though is often done for alliances. Forced unions are still heresy but, in matters of state or among high-ranking persons, love is not always the primary factor in a union. For this reason it is also not uncommon for partners not to marry. An alliance without marriage is not shameful, though more rare. Given that marriage is primarily for the begetting of children and passing on of inheritance, children of unmarried unions are rare—though they are treated no differently from children from marriages.
Marriages are only to one person at a time though the concept of infidelity is nearly nonexistent. It is almost the rule to have liaisons with others while in a marriage regardless of gender. These are done openly and without shame for Elua and His Companions loved many. Gay marriage is not portrayed. Marriages appear to be lifelong, without divorce, though couples can obviously be estranged and any union that becomes displeasing would not be forced to remain together.
Marriages can be performed in a Temple of Elua or anywhere where the sky meets the earth (i.e. outside). A priest/priestess of Elua presides while a priestess of Naamah assists. Marriages are simple affairs though the celebrations afterward are no less large. The ceremony begins with the priest/priestess touching the earth and then embracing the sky. He takes holy oil and touches the foreheads of the couple being married. The oil anointment is repeated by the priestess of Naamah. Vows are then exchanged, with the same vow for the woman and the man. Holding out both hands as though embracing everyone, the priest/priestess then asks the couple to seal their union with a kiss. The priest/priestess then says, "Let it be done", and the ceremony is concluded. Couples sometimes wish a reading of poetry or scripture to be done within the ceremony though it is not required.
Elua's Companions.
Anael.
Anael gave mankind the gift of husbandry and taught the growing of crops and care of the land. Scions of Anael have the telltale scent of apples, which rises from their skin when feeling strong emotions. His province is L'Agnace, the heartland of Terre d'Ange. His priests and priestesses wear brown robes with a rope belt.
Biblical Reference
Anael, or Haniel, is often listed as one of the seven archangels in the Hebrew bible, and is associated with the planet Venus.
Azza.
Azza gifted mankind with knowledge of navigation. The Yeshuites name his sin as that of pride. He founded the realm of Azzalle. Priests and priestesses of Azza wear bronze masks of Azza and saffron tunics with crimson chlamys fastened with bronze brooches.
The temple in the city of Elua has a giant copper dome that can be seen from many areas in the city. In the temple the statue of Azza holds one hand open, palm upward, and the other hand holds a sextant. The burning of incense is common in his worship.
Biblical Reference
Azza, or Ouza, was one of the major angelic leaders in the fall from heaven. Ouza is credited with revealing the grail to King Solomon.
Camael.
Camael is a martial angel, and founded the first armies of D'Angeline troops. His territory is Camlach. His priests wear a dark green surplice and a sword.
Biblical Reference
Camael is one of the seven archangels, and was the leader of the forces that expelled Adam from Eden. He is often considered the angel of pure love.
Cassiel.
Cassiel, alone among the eight, took no province of Terre d'Ange as his own, choosing instead to remain at Elua's side as he traversed the world, a choice for which he believed himself eternally damned. Cassiel has no temples, but the Cassiline Brotherhood was founded for him.
The Cassiline Brotherhood has their own version of the Longest Night called Elua's Vigil.
Biblical Reference
Cassiel is often listed among the seven archangels. He is the angel of solitude and tears and was said to preside over the death of kings.
Eisheth.
Eisheth was noted for her gentleness and for giving humanity the healing arts, which is why so many of the best healers come from her province, which is Eisande. She is also credited with gifting the D'Angelines with music and story, which is why Eisande gave rise to the Mendacants, or traveling bards. Her priests and priestess wear sea-blue robes.
In order to conceive, a woman of Terre d'Ange must pray and light a candle to Eisheth to open the gates of her womb. Once such a prayer is made, it can never be taken back. Unwanted children still occur, but presumably only to those who had invoked Eisheth in their lives previously.
Biblical Reference
Eisheth was one of the four angels associated with sacred prostitution, along with Naamah (see below).
Kushiel.
Kushiel was the Punisher for the One God who delivered torments onto mortal sinners in order that they might repent. Alone among the punishing angels, he understood that chastisement was an act of love; and the sinners in his charge too came to understand and loved him for it. "He gave them pain like balm, and they begged him for it, finding not redemption, but a love that transcended the divine." This displeased the One God, who desired worship above all things. It is said in his province (Kusheth) that when Kushiel's sinners were offered the chance for repentance they refused out of love of their lord. Kushiel saw in Elua a soul that understood what he did, and thus left the service of the One God to follow Elua in his wanderings.
Kusheth is the home of the Shahrizai, one of the Great Houses, who are from his line. One important member of this family is Melisande Shahrizai. According to Melisande, any D'Angeline who kills an anguissette will be tormented in hell for 1000 years but if the D'Angeline is a scion of Kushiel they will be tormented for 10,000 years.
The priests of Kushiel wear black robes and full bronze masks, so that their identities are kept completely secret, including even their gender. Atonement for sins in Kushiel's temple involves a thorough flogging, to purge the guilt from one's soul.
Kushiel's Dart is the name given to a red mote appearing in the eye of one of his chosen mortals, marking the bearer as an "anguissette". The heroine of the first trilogy, Phèdre nó Delaunay, bears this mark.
Biblical Reference
Kushiel is one of the seven angels of punishment, and was said to punish nations with a whip of fire.
Naamah.
She is one of two female angels, and the eldest sister. Her domain is that of sexuality. Naamah's province in Terre d'Ange is Namarre. Priests and Priestesses of Naamah wear scarlet robes.
To enter her order, after training that is very similar to those of the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers, an acolyte must complete a year of Service. During this time they wander Terre d'Ange and are forbidden to refuse anyone who seeks them out of true longing. This is to help them to better understand the sacrifice of the goddess sleeping with mortals. In return Naamah blesses them with desire for each patron. After this year of service they are free to choose patrons and lovers as they wish.
Servants of Naamah refers to those who engage in prostitution, which is a holy act in Terre d'Ange. They bear marques (tattoos) on their backs as a sign of their trade. The most elite of these are the adepts of the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers, also known as the Night Court. Each of these Houses holds to a different explanation of why Naamah lay with the King of Persis, and caters to different preferences accordingly. It is blasphemous for a Servant of Naamah to have an assignation with anyone he or she does not desire, or to be forced to take assignations. For this reason, some Servants of Naamah will complete their marques in other ways (such as clothing design, etc.) and some will simply remain as teachers. For further information see Structure & Initiation
Biblical Reference
In Jewish mythology, Naamah is the name of a demon of sacred prostitution (and a succubus). This is the obvious parallel for which Carey selected the name. For more information on the Jewish myth that parallels the Kushiel's Legacy books, see the article on Naamah the demon. For other references to Naamah, see Naamah.
Shemhazai.
Shemhazai is noted for treasuring knowledge, and is credited with teaching the D'Angelines their written language. His territory is Siovale and his priests and priestesses wear grey robes.
One of his temples in southern Siovale has a mechanical statue of Shemhazai, which moves to turn a placard toward his worshippers. The placard says, "All knowledge is worth having".
Biblical Reference
In the Hebrew bible, Shemhazai, or Samyaza, was the leader of the Grigori, the angels who birthed the Nephilim and taught mankind the secrets of civilization.
Similarities to Éloa.
Elua sounds similar to the name Éloa from the French poem Éloa, ou La sœur des anges which deals with an innocent angel falling in love with a stranger (Lucifer) who had turned away from the One God. Eloa was also born from a tear, this one shed by Christ at the death of Lazarus, as cited here.

Waltham Chase

Waltham Chase is a village in Hampshire, England, neighbouring the village of Bishop's Waltham.
The village comprises about 2 sq. kilometres of land to the south-east of Bishop's Waltham.
History.
Previously a forest used for the hierarchy of Bishop's Waltham to hunt game, the village started to establish its own, independent identity in the 19th Century.
Amenities.
The village has a primary school - St John the Baptist CoE; older children attend the Swanmore College of Technology nearby. It has several green areas, e.g. a recreation ground and park area. It has a thriving village hall which is used by many societies and clubs. There is a bicycle shop, two village stores, one of which includes the post office and there is also a hairdresser. There is a garage with car repair, a car sales outlet and a commercial vehicle sales business.
It has a Methodist church; the local Anglican church, St John the Baptist, is located at Shedfield. The parish of Shedfield includes Shirrell Heath, Waltham Chase and Shedfield.
There are two inns, "The Chase" (formerly "The Fountain") and "The Black Dog". 
There are stables and several farms in the village area.
Demographics.
According to the ONS (from the 2001 census) the population of the whole Winchester LSOA (Lower Layer Super Output Areas) - "Winchester 012F" area which includes both Waltham Chase and most of Shirrell Heath was 1,404, with 533 households.
Places of interest.
There is an SSSI site (unit ID 1007744) within the village, Waltham Chase Meadows - "one of the best examples in the county of dry neutral unimproved pasture."
Across the road from the Moors Nature Reserve is the Chase Mill, which was in still in use in 1957. This mill has been featured on a television restoration programme - Salvage Squad - which first aired on Channel 4 in January 2003.

<doc id="5987632" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987632" title="Consulate shopping">
Consulate shopping

Consulate shopping is the practice of applying for visas at different consulate posts - or choosing a more "suitable" post in advance, in the hope of finding one that will be more sympathetic to the applicant and thus approve the visa, or in order to have one's application processed faster. It was typically associated with making a visa application at a visa office located outside of one's home country.
The term "consulate shopping" may have appeared by analogy with "forum shopping" - choosing the best jurisdiction for litigation.
In the past, "consulate shopping" was not an uncommon practice for both visitor and permanent resident visas. For example, a Russian citizen would choose to apply for a visitor visa to the US at a US consulate somewhere in Eastern Europe, rather than one in Russia, based on the belief that, due to different office cultures of the consular staff, the likelihood of rejection would be lower, say, in Budapest than in Moscow. Similarly, a person planning a trip to mainland China may plan on obtaining his or her visitor's visa in a visa office in Hong Kong, immediately before entering the mainland, instead of doing it in advance in their own home country.
When applying for permanent residence in Canada, a person living in India, but possessing a multiple entry visitor visa to the UK or a Schengen country could choose to file his application with a Canadian visa office in European, rather than one in India, because the posted processing times were supposed to be much shorter in Europe.
Lately, many countries cut down on the practice of consulate shopping by requiring that permanent residence visa applications, and often visitor visa applications as well, be filed only in visa offices within the country of the applicant's citizenship of residence. As of the summer 2008 People's Republic of China joined this trend, requiring all visa applicants only to apply in the Chinese consulate in the country where they are citizens or permanent residents; moreover, in some countries served by multiple consulates (as the USA is), the application must be filed in the consular district serving the area where the applicant resides.
An important exception to that trend is that as of July 2010 the U.S. Consulates in China have liberalized their appointment policy. Now, persons who reside in Mainland China can choose to apply for a nonimmigrant visa at any of the Mainland posts—Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shanghai, or Shenyang.

<doc id="5987636" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987636" title="USS Trefoil (IX-149)">
USS Trefoil (IX-149)

USS "Trefoil" (IX-149), the lead ship of her class of concrete-hulled cargo barge, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be given that name. Her keel was laid down in 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1329) by the Barrett, Hilp & Belair Shipyard in San Francisco, California (Type B7-D1). She was acquired by the Navy on 5 March 1944 as "Midnight" (the second ship of that name), designated unclassified miscellaneous vessel IX-149, and placed in service on 9 March 1944 with Lieutenant Neal King, USNR, in charge.
Service history.
World War II, 1944–1945.
"Midnight" completed conversion for Navy use on 28 March and was assigned to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet. That same day, she was towed out of San Francisco, California, on her way to the Central Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she continued her voyage and arrived in Majuro Lagoon on 4 May. For the next five months, she served at Majuro and Eniwetok. During that time, she was renamed "Trefoil" on 10 June 1944.
On 5 October, towed her out of Eniwetok and on to Ulithi where she arrived on 16 October. She remained there for ten months on duty with Service Squadron 8. In August 1945, she was towed from Ulithi to Leyte in the Philippines where she arrived on 28 August. "Trefoil" remained there until 9 November, when she was towed out for Guam in the Mariana Islands. The barge reached Apra Harbor on 16 November.
Post-war activities, 1945–1948.
"Trefoil" served at Guam for the remainder of her Navy career. Early in 1946, she was chosen as one of the support ships for "Operation Crossroads", the atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll that summer. However, soon thereafter, that decision was rescinded and another made to dispose of her. Action on that decision was also deferred, and she was used to house Stockton-Pollack employees building a drydock in Apra Harbor. Her reprieve ended in September 1947 when she was determined to be in excess of the needs of the Navy.
Disposal.
On 28 May 1948, the barge was turned over to the Foreign Liquidations Commission of the United States Department of State for disposal, and she was sold to the Asia Development Corporation of Shanghai, China. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 December 1948. The barge, however, remained at Apra Harbor because she was impounded due to a dispute over ownership of the vessel between the Asia Development Corporation and Moellers, Limited, of Hong Kong. Resolution of the dispute and final disposition of the barge is unknown.

Uncertainty quantification

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the science of quantitative characterization and reduction of uncertainties in applications. It tries to determine how likely certain outcomes are if some aspects of the system are not exactly known. An example would be to predict the acceleration of a human body in a head-on crash with another car: even if we exactly knew the speed, small differences in the manufacturing of individual cars, how tightly every bolt has been tightened, etc., will lead to different results that can only be predicted in a statistical sense.
Many problems in the natural sciences and engineering are also rife with sources of uncertainty. Computer experiments on computer simulations are the most common approach to study problems in uncertainty quantification.
Sources of uncertainty.
Uncertainty can enter mathematical models and experimental measurements in various contexts. One way to categorize the sources of uncertainty is to consider:
Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
Another way of categorization is to classify uncertainty into two categories:
In real life applications, both kinds of uncertainties are often present. Uncertainty quantification intends to work toward reducing epistemic uncertainties to aleatoric uncertainties. The quantification for the aleatoric uncertainties is relatively straightforward to perform. Techniques such as Monte Carlo method are frequently used. A probability distribution can be represented by its moments (in the Gaussian case, the mean and covariance suffice, although it should be noted that, in general, even knowledge of all moments to arbitrarily high order still does not specify the distribution function uniquely), or more recently, by techniques such as Karhunen–Loève and polynomial chaos expansions. To evaluate epistemic uncertainties, the efforts are made to gain better knowledge of the system, process or mechanism. Methods such as fuzzy logic or evidence theory (Dempster–Shafer theory – a generalization of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability) are used.
Two types of uncertainty quantification problems.
There are two major types of problems in uncertainty quantification: one is the forward propagation of uncertainty and the other is the inverse assessment of model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. There has been a proliferation of research on the former problem and a majority of uncertainty analysis techniques were developed for it. On the other hand, the latter problem is drawing increasing attention in the engineering design community, since uncertainty quantification of a model and the subsequence predictions of the true system response(s) are of great interest in both robust design and engineering design making.
Forward uncertainty propagation.
Uncertainty propagation is the quantification of uncertainties in system output(s) propagated from uncertain inputs. It focuses on the influence on the outputs from the "parametric variability" listed in the sources of uncertainty. The targets of uncertainty propagation analysis can be:
Inverse uncertainty quantification.
Inverse uncertainty quantification is that, given some experimental measurements of a system and some computer simulation results from its mathematical model, to estimate the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model (which is called bias correction), and to estimate the values of unknown parameters in the model if there is any (which is called parameter calibration or simply calibration). Generally it is a much more difficult problem than uncertainty propagation; however it is of great importance since it is typically implemented in a model updating process. There are several scenarios in inverse uncertainty quantification:
Bias correction only.
It considers an inaccurate model but without any unknown parameter. The target is to assess the "model inadequacy". The general model updating formulation for bias correction is:
where formula_2 denotes the experimental measurements as a function of several input variables formula_3, formula_4 denotes the computer model (mathematical model) response, formula_5 denotes the additive discrepancy function (aka bias function), and formula_6 denotes the experimental uncertainty. The objective is to estimate the discrepancy function formula_5, and as a by-product, the resulting updated model is formula_8. A prediction confidence interval is provided with the updated model as the quantification of the uncertainty.
Parameter calibration only.
It considers a model that fully describes the underlying physics but with one or more unknown parameters. The general model updating formulation for calibration is:
where formula_10 denotes the computer model response that depends on several unknown model parameters formula_11, and formula_12 denotes the true values of the unknown parameters in the course of experiments. The objective is to either estimate formula_12, or to come up with a probability distribution of formula_12 that encompasses the best knowledge of the true parameter values.
Bias correction and parameter calibration.
It considers an inaccurate model with one or more unknown parameters, and its model updating formulation combines the two together:
It is the most comprehensive model updating formulation that includes all possible sources of uncertainty, and it requires the most effort to solve.
Selective methodologies for uncertainty quantification.
Much research has been done to solve uncertainty quantification problems, though a majority of them deal with uncertainty propagation. During the past one to two decades, a number of approaches for inverse uncertainty quantification problems have also been developed and have proved to be useful for most small- to medium-scale problems.
Methodologies for forward uncertainty propagation.
Existing uncertainty propagation approaches include probabilistic approaches and non-probabilistic approaches. There are basically five categories of probabilistic approaches for uncertainty propagation:
For non-probabilistic approaches, interval analysis
, Fuzzy theory, possibility theory and evidence theory are among the most widely used.
The probabilistic approach is considered as the most rigorous approach to uncertainty analysis in engineering design due to its consistency with the theory of decision analysis. Its cornerstone is the calculation of probability density functions for sampling statistics. This can be performed rigorously for random variables that are obtainable as transformations of Gaussian variables, leading to exact confidence intervals.
Methodologies for inverse uncertainty quantification.
Frequentist.
In regression analysis and least squares problems, the standard error of parameter estimates is readily available, which can be expanded into a confidence interval.
Bayesian.
Several methodologies for inverse uncertainty quantification exist under the Bayesian framework. The most complicated direction is to aim at solving problems with both bias correction and parameter calibration. The challenges of such problems include not only the influences from model inadequacy and parameter uncertainty, but also the lack of data from both computer simulations and experiments. A common situation is that the input settings are not the same over experiments and simulations.
Modular Bayesian approach.
An approach to inverse uncertainty quantification is the modular Bayesian approach. The modular Bayesian approach derives its name from its four-module procedure. Apart from the current available data, a prior distribution of unknown parameters should be assigned.
To address the issue from lack of simulation results, the computer model is replaced with a Gaussian Process (GP) model
where
formula_18 is the dimension of input variables, and formula_19 is the dimension of unknown parameters.While formula_20 is pre-defined, formula_21, known as "hyperparameters" of the GP model, need to be estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This module can be considered as a generalized Kriging method.
Similarly with the first module, the discrepancy function is replaced with a GP model
where
Together with the prior distribution of unknown parameters, and data from both computer models and experiments, one can derive the maximum likelihood estimates for formula_24. At the same time, formula_25 from Module 1 gets updated as well.
Bayes' theorem is applied to calculate the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters:
where formula_27 includes all the fixed hyperparameters in previous modules.
Fully Bayesian approach.
Fully Bayesian approach requires that not only the priors for unknown parameters formula_11 but also the priors for the other hyperparameters formula_27 should be assigned. It follows the following steps:
However, the approach has significant drawbacks:
The fully Bayesian approach requires a huge amount of calculations and may not yet be practical for dealing with the most complicated modelling situations.
Known issues.
The theories and methodologies for uncertainty propagation are much better established, compared with inverse uncertainty quantification. For the latter, several difficulties remain unsolved:

Matko Laginja

Matko Laginja (born in Klana near Kastav, August 10, 1852 - died in Zagreb, March 18, 1930) was a Croatian lawyer and politician. 
He earned a doctorate in law in Graz. In his youth he adopted the political program of Ante Starčević and together with Vjekoslav Spinčić and Matko Mandić brought Croatian national thinking and sharp attacks against Italian nationalism into the political life of Istria. The "Father of Istria" fought for three decades for the region's renaissance, which he continued in Zagreb, particularly as the ban of Croatia. From 1900 to 1915 he was an attorney in Pula; in 1915 he moved his practice to Zagreb.
He was one of the leaders of the Croatian national movement in Istria as well as a member of the Istrian provincial parliament from 1883 to 1914. For one period he was ambassador to the Imperial Council in Vienna, then president of Starčević's Party of Rights. During the upheaval of fall 1918 he was trustee of the National Council in Istria. From February to December 1920 Laginja was ban of Croatia within the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He was dismissed by the cabinet of Milenko Radomar Vesnić on December 11, 1920 after allowing a rally by Croatian Peasant Party politician Stjepan Radić in Zagreb on December 8.
He was selected to the Constitutional Assembly which he resigned on June 1, 1921 along with ten others issuing a statement against centralization and for a federalized country. After this he withdrew from public life.

Arnold A. "Arnie" Knepper (October 10, 1930 - June 6, 1992), was an American racecar driver.
Born in Belleville, Illinois, Knepper also died there as from cancer. He drove in the USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1963-1972 seasons, with 75 career starts, including the 1965-1969 Indianapolis 500 races. He finished in the top ten 21 times, with his best finish in 3rd position twice in 1966. Knepper earned a small place in Indianapolis lore when he crashed on the 87th lap of the 1969 Indianapolis 500, and instead of making the typical dash to trackside safety, stood up on his car and, facing 180-mph oncoming traffic, frantically waved his arms to warn oncoming drivers of the danger.

<doc id="5987674" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987674" title="Wellow, Hampshire">
Wellow, Hampshire

Wellow is a village in Hampshire, England that falls within the Test Valley district. The village lies just outside the New Forest across the main A36 road which runs from the M27 motorway to Salisbury. The nearest town is Romsey (6 km) and the nearest city Southampton (13 km). The village has a population of just over 3,000. 
Confusingly, some people refer to the two villages of East Wellow and West Wellow individually, while others refer to them collectively as Wellow. There is no official administrative or political division which separates the two parts and they share the same parish council, which also covers the small settlement of Canada. Canada is just inside the New Forest boundary and can only be reached by public road from the roundabout on the A36 at West Wellow. King Alfred (d. 899) left "the toune of Welewe" in his will to his eldest daughter Ethelgifu. "Welue" is mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086) where it is recorded that Agemund had five hides of about there. Only the name "Wellow" appears on Saxton's 1575 map of Hampshire, spelled "Wellew" in various maps from the seventeenth century. East and West Wellow appear separately by the time of John Harrison's 1788 map, separated by the River Blackwater. Their exact positions on these early maps are hard to reconcile with the modern road and settlement pattern but until 1895 when the county boundary was realigned, West Wellow was in Wiltshire and East Wellow in Hampshire. 
Most of the current housing dates from the Twentieth Century, with a few earlier buildings (notably some thatched cottages). There is continuing small-scale infill development. All the principal services are found in the larger West Wellow and include a Post Office, some small shops, a filling station, village hall, recreation ground and Wellow School. The school was originally funded by money from Florence Nightingale's family, and bears a plaque recording that information. 
There is a public house, the Red Rover, on the A36 and another, the Rockingham, in Canada. The smaller East Wellow, approximately 1 km to the north is mainly residential. Throughout the 1990s there was discussion of various options for the construction of a Wellow bypass route to relieve the village of the increasing volume of traffic on the A36 but none of these was built. The northern boundary of the modern village is effectively the River Blackwater and the surrounding area is agricultural. The former Wellow Mill on the Blackwater was served by a complicated series of sluices to deal with changes in water level but was converted to a private residence in 1945 and no machinery remains. Along the river are a series of lakes which form the site of Woodington and Whinwhistle fisheries. West Wellow is also home to Carlo's, a popular ice cream parlour and tea shop. 
The parish church of St. Margaret of Antioch is a flint-faced stone structure consecrated in 1215 and the interior contains some wall paintings from this period. In 1251 Henry III of England granted a charter to Wellow to hold an annual fair on the eve of St Margaret's Day. A chancel was added in the Thirteenth Century and a south aisle in the Fifteenth Century, but the church is famous as the burial site of Florence Nightingale, whose family home was the nearby Embley Park, now a private school. St Margaret's is a destination for many visitors interested in Nightingale and the history of nursing. The church is some distance from the majority of the modern housing and there is no archaeological evidence that there was ever a substantial settlement close to the church.

Wherwell

Wherwell is a village on the River Test in Hampshire, England. The name may derive from its bubbling springs resulting in the Middle Ages place name “Hwerwyl” noted in AD 955, possibly meaning “kettle springs” or “cauldron springs.” Pronunciation of the name has ranged from “Hurrell” to “Wer-rel” to present-day “Wher-well.”
Before the Dissolution, the parish of Wherwell was in the hands of an important abbey of Benedictine nuns, whose abbess was Lady of the Manor of an area much larger than the existing parish.

Ivan Radulov

Ivan Radulov () (born 7 January 1939 in Burgas) is a Bulgarian chess grandmaster.
As a chess player, he was most prominent during the 1970s, winning the Bulgarian Championship in 1971, 1974, 1977 and 1980. He just missed out at the 1976 event, finishing 2nd (with Peicho Peev, after Evgeny Ermenkov). It was during this decade that Radulov took over from Georgi Tringov as Bulgaria's leading player, eventually giving way to Kiril Georgiev in the 1980s. 
International tournament victories came at Torremolinos 1971 (shared with Miguel Quinteros), Helsinki 1972, Montilla 1974 (ahead of a strong field including Lubomir Kavalek, Helmut Pfleger, Miguel Quinteros, Florin Gheorghiu and Ulf Andersson), Bajmok 1975 (shared with Milan Matulović and Milan Vukić), Montilla 1975 (shared with Lev Polugaevsky) and Kikinda 1976. Second places at Varna 1968, Debrecen 1968 and Silkeborg 1983 were also noteworthy achievements and his third place at Albena in 1975, contributed to a busy and successful year.

David Stephen Forbes (born November 16, 1948) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey player.
Signed as a free agent in 1973 by the Boston Bruins, Forbes made an impact as a defensive-minded forward as he helped guide the Bruins to the finals in 1974 during his rookie season, and to the finals in 1977. Forbes played four seasons with Boston until he was claimed by the Washington Capitals in the Waiver Draft prior to the 1977–78 season. After playing one season with the Capitals, he was released after only playing two games during the 1978–79 season and signed to play for the Cincinnati Stingers of the World Hockey Association.
Criminal charges.
Forbes was charged with aggravated assault in 1975 after butt-ending Henry Boucha's eye socket in a game against the Minnesota North Stars. The trial received much publicity as it was highly unusual for an athlete to face criminal charges for actions taken in the course of competition. The trial ended with the jury unable to reach a decision and the charges were not refiled.

Cub Scouts (Scouting Ireland)

Cub Scouts or Macaoimh () is the name given to youth members Scouting Ireland and previously Scouting Ireland (CSI), of the Cub Scout age group. The terms Macaoimh and Cub are often co-existent though Macaoimh represents a different tradition. Both boys and girls participate in the Macaoimh programme though some Scout Groups accept boys only. Its membership is the largest of the four Scouting Ireland Sections. The Macaoimh programme is part of the worldwide Scouting movement and aims to promote character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.
Methodology.
Macaoimh are arranged into "clans", each named for a character in Gaelic Mythology. A number of clans who meet together is called a Macaoimh "cath" (Irish for Tribe). Each "clan" has a "rí" (Irish for King) which is equivalent to a "sixer" or "denner" in Cub Scouts who adopts a position of responsibity for the clan. Each "rí" is assisted by an "aire" (Irish for Helper). Often an "Árd Rí" (Irish for High King) is appointed to supervise the operation of the clan system. The methodology is consistent with the Scout method as prescribed by the World Organization of the Scout Movement and is firmly in the tradition of Baden-Powell. The small groups have a clearly defined leadership system and the emphasis is certainly on learning by doing.
Personal Progression.
The personal progressive scheme takes the form of badges which use a certain number of arrows to determine how far along in the programme the Macaoimh is. The three stages are bronze (one arrow), silver (two arrows) and gold (three arrows).
Leadership.
Leaders also adopt a persona, e.g. Fionn, Niamh, Cúchulainn. The titles are similar to Akela and help to surround the youth members with the national folklore and an environment of role play that is unique to Scouting and to Scouting in Ireland in particular. Baden-Powell chose Kipling's Jungle Book as a source of symbolism and allegorical framework for the youngest members of the Scouting movement and Macaoimh follows in his footsteps by putting this educational tool into an Irish context.

Gordon Wallace (footballer born 1944)

Gordon Wallace (born 13 June 1944 in Lanark) is a Scottish former footballer, who played for Liverpool during the 1960s.
Wallace's main claims to fame were scoring twice in the very first BBC "Match of the Day" and being Liverpool's first ever European Champions' Cup goal scorer, with the first goal in an away tie against Reykjavík, both occurring in August 1964.
Despite such a promising start his first team opportunities were limited by the consistency, fitness and excellent disciplinary records of Liverpool's twin strike force, Roger Hunt and Ian St John, respectively England and Scotland internationals. Wallace played for Liverpool Reserves between 1965 and 1967. When Tony Hateley joined Liverpool in 1967, Wallace left on a free transfer, joining Crewe Alexandra. Wallace scored 20 goals in 94 league appearances for Crewe in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

USS Quartz (IX-150)

USS "Quartz" (IX-150), a designated an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for quartz or silicon dioxide (Si02) a hard, vitreous mineral occurring in many varieties and comprising 12% of the earth's crust. Her keel was laid down as MC hull 1330 by Barrett and Hilp, Belair Shipyards, San Francisco, California (T. B7.D1). She was launched on 4 December 1943, and accepted by the Navy and placed in service on 13 April 1944 with Lieutenant Commander Paul N. Runyon in command.
Service history.
World War II, 1944–1945.
Designed to provide facilities for the issuance of stores at advanced bases, "Quartz" was assigned to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet (ComServPac). She was towed to Pearl Harbor from San Francisco, arriving on 10 May 1944. Operating with Service Squadrons 8 and 10, she was typical of the "Green Dragons" or "Crockery" ships, which acted as warehouses afloat and packed every conceivable supply item within their holds. She provided services at Majuro, Eniwetok, Ulithi, Leyte, and Guam.
"Quartz" specialized in the handling of clothing, together with general stores. High speed provision ships made runs to the far reaches of the Pacific, transferred their cargoes to the "crockery" ships, and then returned to the United States for another load without awaiting piecemeal discharge of their cargoes.
Post-war activities and fate, 1945–1947.
After V-J Day "Quartz" was assigned to support "Operation Crossroads", atomic bomb testing. "Quartz" was part of Task Group 1 and 8, a supply and support group to the testing. After the detonation "Quartz" was towed to Kwajalein for study and monitoring. After verifying her free of radioactive contamination, the Navy sold her on 23 October 1947 to the Powell River Company of Powell River, British Columbia, where she was permanently anchored with nine other hulks to form a breakwater protecting the Catalyst Paper Mill.

Florence Balcombe

Florence Balcombe (17 July 1858 – 25 May 1937) was the wife of Bram Stoker, whom she married in Dublin in 1878. She was the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel James Balcombe of 1 Marino Crescent, Clontarf, and wife Phillippa Anne Marshall, and was a celebrated beauty whose former suitor was Oscar Wilde. Bram Stoker had known Wilde from his student days, having proposed him for membership of the university’s Philosophical Society while he was president. Wilde was upset at Florence's decision, but Stoker later resumed the acquaintanceship and after Wilde's fall visited him on the Continent.
The Stokers moved to London, where Stoker became acting-manager and then business manager of Henry Irving's Lyceum Theatre, London, a post he held for 27 years. On 31 December 1879, Bram and Florence's only child was born, a son that they christened Irving Noel Thornley Stoker.
Balcombe is chiefly remembered as being responsible for the destruction of most of the prints of the 1922 horror film "Nosferatu", which was based without attribution or permission on Stoker's novel "Dracula". She was unaware of the existence of Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau's "Nosferatu" until she received an anonymous letter from Berlin. The document included the program of a lavish cinematic event held in 1922, complete with full orchestral accompaniment, that had taken place in the Marble Garden at Berlin Zoological Garden. The German film was described in the handbill as "freely adapted from Bram Stoker's Dracula." ("Nosferatu" screenwriter Henrik Galeen had changed the names of the main characters and made some liberal changes to certain key points. However, the resemblance to Stoker's novel is unmistakable.)
Balcombe was struggling financially and, as Stoker's literary executor, had never given permission for the adaptation, nor received payment for it. Her furious response to this copyright infringement was prompt and uncompromising; not only did she want the financial reparation she felt was due to the estate, she demanded that the negative and all prints of the film (which she would never actually see) be immediately destroyed.
Balcombe launched a lawsuit in which she was represented by the lawyers of the British Incorporated Society of Authors. The suit took some time to resolve; at one point, the German production company Prana-Film declared bankruptcy to avoid paying for the adaptation. Finally, she won the case, with the final ruling in July 1925 stating that the negatives and all prints of the film should be handed over to her to be destroyed.
Despite this ruling, prints of the film slowly began to resurface in the late 1920s, with the first American screenings taking place in New York City and Detroit in 1929.
Balcombe did grant the rights to the stage adaptation of Dracula to Hamilton Deane, who had been a neighbour of hers in Dublin. The play premiered in Derby in 1924. In 1927 Horace Liveright bought the American dramatic rights from Florence and hired John L. Balderston to edit it for the New York stage. The show ran for a year on Broadway and for two more years on tour, breaking all previous records for any show put on tour in the United States. However, Liveright failed to pay Florence all her entitlements for the show - he died shortly afterwards.
Florence Balcombe outlived her husband by 25 years and died in 1937 at the age of 78. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, and her ashes scattered at the Gardens of Rest there. The original plan had been to keep her ashes and those of her husband together in a display urn. After Irving Noel Stoker's death in 1961, his ashes were added to those of his father's in that urn.

The Sand Pebbles

The Sand Pebbles is a 1962 novel by American author Richard McKenna about a Yangtze River gunboat and its crew in 1926. Prior to its publication by Harper & Row, the book was featured in the "Saturday Evening Post" and later used as the storyline for a movie of the same name.
Background.
Richard McKenna served aboard a Yangtze River gunboat in 1936 but set the novel a decade earlier, during the Nationalist Northern Expedition of 1925–1927, aboard the fictional USS "San Pablo", a gunboat left from the Spanish–American War. The phrase "sand pebble" is a pun on the boat's name; thus, the sailors who serve on her are the "sand pebbles".
Plot.
The novel describes a life of boredom and sudden battle action, but the chief conflict is between the traditional western ideas, which saw China in racist and imperialist terms, and emerging nationalism. The protagonist, engine mechanic Jake Holman, teaches his Chinese workers—he refuses to call them "coolies"—to master the ship's machinery by understanding it, not just "monkey see, monkey do". The ship is sent to save the China Light Mission from anti-foreign mobs, setting off a debate: "No man who favors the unequal treaties has the right to call himself a Christian!" Others reply "It is time for the Society for Propagation of the Gospel to step aside. It is time for the Society for Propagation of Cannonballs to bring them to their senses." After the crew burn and destroy a war junk, Holman takes a landing squad to rescue the missionaries, but is pinned down and killed.
Reception and review.
It was serialized in the "Saturday Evening Post" for the three issues from November 17, 1962 through December 1, 1962. The author completed it in May 1962, just in time to enter it in the 1963 Harper Prize Novel Contest. Not only was it picked over 544 other entries for the $10,000 first prize and accepted for publication by Harper & Row, but it was also chosen as the following January's Book-of-the-Month Club selection.

Amesbury is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, formerly in North York before it was amalgamated into Toronto in 1998. It is part of federal and provincial electoral district York South—Weston, and Toronto electoral wards 11: York South—Weston (West) and 12: York South-Weston (East). 
Its borders are inexact. It is usually assumed to lie between Lawrence Avenue on the north, Jane Street and the railway line adjacent to Weston Road (which includes land west of Jane) on the west, Keele Street on the east, and a hydro right of way, which also marks the southern border of North York, on the south.
A middle-income neighbourhood, it is popular with immigrants of many countries. The first language in more than a third of the houses is a foreign tongue, including Italian (the most prevalent), Bengali, Spanish, Vietnamese and Tamil.
There are five parks within the confines of the neighbourhood, including the Westview greenbelt. Many parks are saved from construction zones.
The area west of Jane Street is known as Brookhaven. The City of Toronto's demographic page refers to that area as Brookhaven-Amesbury, but omits the area north of Lawrence Avenue, and includes the largely industrial area between Keele Street and the railway. This area had a 2006 population of 17,325.

Pui O (Chinese: 貝澳, or 杯澳), formerly Lo Pui O (螺杯澳), is an area on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. It is a popular destination for holiday camping in Hong Kong. Visitors may also rent village houses for leisure. Located in the South Lantau, there are four main villages in Pui O, they are Lo Wai (老圍), San Wai (新圍), Lo Uk (羅屋), and Ham Tin (鹹田). Pui O is located at the edge of Lantau South Country Park.
Geography.
Pui O is a bay shaped by the Chi Ma Wan Peninsula and the lower slopes of Sunset Peak. A main river from a valley to the east and other small river gather at Pui O forming an estuary of wetland. Villagers enclosed the wetland and converted it into rice paddies. This is indicated by the name Ham Tin (鹹田), salty paddy field. At the shore, a long beach (or spit) is formed by the interaction between the current of the South China Sea and the rivers.
Pui O Beach.
Pui O Beach (貝澳泳灘) runs along almost the entire shoreline of Pui O. Due to the geological composition of surrounding area, the sand on the beach is mixture of black and yellow. The Hong Kong Government has constructed facilities on the upper beach for wild camping.
History.
During the Qing Dynasty, villages near the shore in Hong Kong were frequently attacked by pirates. Villages in Pui O were constructed as walled villages to assist in repelling these attacks, and several of the Lantau villages, though getting a living from the sea, were by design located at some distance from it.
Historical buildings.
29 historical buildings and features of Pui O are listed by the Antiquities and Monuments Office.
In Ham Tin, at Chung Hau (涌口) (the river mouth) there is a Tin Hau Temple. It was built in the Ming Dynasty, rebuilt in 1798 and repaired in 1947, 1974 and 1995. It is surrounded by two feng shui trees, and an earth god shrine is located at its right side.
Other historical buildings include:
Flora and fauna.
Mangrove can be found on both sides of the estuary between Ham Tin and Pui O beach.
A resident population of water buffaloes can be found in Pui O. It is one of the few remaining areas where they still occur in Hong Kong.
Transport.
Pui O is on the South Lantau Road. All bus routes between Mui Wo and other points pass through Pui O. A branch road, Chi Ma Wan Road routes across Chi Ma Wan Peninsula to Chi Ma Wan.

Arthur W. Page

Arthur W. Page was a vice president and director of AT&T from 1927 to 1947, in charge of what is today called communications, public affairs and public relations. In the decades since, Page has become generally recognized as the dean of public relations and communications. 
In the course of his writing, Page established a series of public relations heuristics generally referred to as the Page Principles.
He was born 10 September 1883 to Walter Hines Page and his wife Willa A. Page of Aberdeen, North Carolina. Arthur helped his father with the monthly magazine World's Work, and in 1913 took over as editor from his father.
In 1927 Walter S. Gifford induced Page to become vice-president for public relations at AT&T. One of his first assignments was to prepare a speech for President Gifford to present in October that year to the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners meeting in Dallas, Texas. As John Brooks later observed, "Gifford laid the company’s social objectives on the line in a way that, in a national climate of rampant individualism and general greed to get in on the business and stock market boom, was clearly business heresy." Page had researched the writings of former President Theodore N. Vail who put service first, profit second. In 1941, when the book "The Bell Telephone System" by A.W. Page was published, the Dallas speech was quoted in chapter 2: "Responsibility for such a large part of the entire telephone service of the country...imposes on the management an unusual obligation to the public..." The chapter titles of the book show its appeal: 2: Policies, 3: Good service, 4: Overtones of good service, 5: Reasonable price, 6: Just and reasonable wages. In 1935 a joint resolution of Congress resulted in an investigation of the company, which Page reports on in chapter 15. He writes, "newspaper reporters..., when scandal did not appear, rather neglected the hearings".
As a document of company disclosure, the book made a list of the current directors which at that time included Charles Francis Adams III, Winthrop W. Aldrich, Lewis H. Brown, John W. Davis, W. Cameron Forbes, Myron C. Taylor, and Daniel Willard.
Arthur lived until September, 1960.
He is today recognized in the name of an organization called the Arthur W. Page Society, whose members are corporate Chief communications officers or senior officials at public relations agencies. Since 2002 the Society has been a sponsor of an annual "Corporate Communications Case Study Competition".
In addition, The Arthur W. Page Center for Integrity in Public Communication is a research center at The Pennsylvania State University College of Communications dedicated to the study and advancement of ethics and responsibility in corporate communication and other forms of public communication.

Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)

Ashtar is the name given to an extraterrestrial being or group of beings which some number of people claim to have channeled. UFO contactee George Van Tassel was the first to have claimed to have received a message, in 1952, from Ashtar. Since then many different claims about Ashtar have appeared in different contexts, and is studied by academics as a prominent form of UFO religion.
Van Tassel.
Although the purported method of communication resembled what is commonly referred to as "channeling", Van Tassel claimed to have established a new form of telepathic communication with extraterrestrial intelligences utilizing a method which included both natural human abilities and the use of an allegedly advanced form of alien technology, rather than the more traditionally "religious" non-technological spiritual medium based approach taken by many other early channelers of the era. Van Tassel maintained that the method he utilized was not a "paranormal" or "metaphysical" activity, but rather an example of the application of an allegedly advanced extraterrestrial science, that anyone could implement with the proper training.
Residing near a large boulder, situated in the desert of southern California called Giant Rock, in a UFO-focused community he founded in 1947, the earliest messages Van Tassel claimed to have received from Ashtar were first presented to the public at an annual event called the Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention, which he himself organized. Van Tassel's early purported messages from Ashtar contained a great deal of apocalyptic material, which focused on concerns regarding the development of the soon to be tested hydrogen bomb. Van Tassel also claimed that Ashtar had provided specific messages that he was expected to pass on to the U.S. federal government regarding the potential negative impacts of the proposed upcoming bomb tests.
Ashtar Command.
As the weekly channeling sessions at Giant Rock continued through the early 1950s, the alleged Ashtar messages became much more elaborate and began to provide details of the purported existence of an extraterrestrial "government", which claimed to closely monitor activities on Earth and offered material and spiritual support to its citizens. This concept of an "Ashtar Command" was appropriated for use by a number of prominent early alleged channelers, both inside and outside the Giant Rock community, and was soon being utilized by several in the context of their own personal claimed messages from Ashtar, along with the use of the figure of Ashtar himself, originally developed by Van Tassel.
By 1955, a few well known channelers of the era, including Elouise Moeller, had incorporated the concept of an Ashtar Command and related ideas, as key components of their own developing systems. Several channelers, including Van Tassel himself, began publishing accounts which described predictions of the imminent arrival of an Ashtar-led UFO armada on Earth, in order to guide and protect mankind. The public failure of these predictions had an enormous negative effect on the expansion of the Ashtar Command 'movement'. Without Van Tassel's role as a single authority constituting the sole source of messages from Ashtar, the movement became less cohesive and began to splinter from internal pressures. Several dozen channelers were simultaneously claiming to be obtaining, in some cases, competing authoritative messages directly from Ashtar. The overall movement began to wane in relative popularity because of infighting.
Broadcasts.
In 1971, a British radio talk show devoted to UFOs received a strange call-in claiming to originate from outer space, which some of the guests believed to be genuine. This turned out to be the prelude for the 1977 Southern Television broadcast interruption, when a voice calling itself "Vrillon" of The Ashtar Galactic Command temporarily took over a television receiver in southern England.
Tuella.
After decreasing in popularity within the New Age community for a period of roughly twenty years, the concept of an Ashtar Command was revitalized by a channeler named Thelma B. Terrill, (best known as "Tuella") who channeled messages and wrote a series of books on the subject in the 1970s and 1980s. Her work shifted the focus from Van Tassel's extraterrestrial technological model, to a more 'spiritualized' approach. Tuella's version of the Ashtar narrative tended to play down the necessity of the direct involvement of UFOs in human affairs, with the shift of importance being laid onto purely interior spiritual development as a means of reaching "higher dimensions" and receiving the assistance of Ashtar Command. Despite Tuella's influences, several channelers maintained a separate more UFO-based cosmology, which insisted on the importance of messages from Ashtar containing predictions of the imminent destruction of earth, and the need for a literal physical evacuation of the planet, with the assistance of the spacecraft of Ashtar Command. By the 1990s, the movement began to splinter into factions once again.
Yvonne Cole.
Yvonne Cole, who claimed to be channeling Ashtar messages from 1986, predicted the destruction of all Earth civilizations and the arrival on the planet of various alien cultures in 1994. Cole claimed that governments were working with extraterrestrials to prepare for contact. These prophecies furthered the continued fracturing and disappointment within the movement when they failed to occur.
Developments after the mid-1990s.
Despite these failures, by the mid-1990s, and continuing to present, several of these channeling groups began to utilize the Internet in order to promulgate their beliefs and to attempt to encourage a movement toward unifying the movement and establishing a single 'authoritative' source for all Ashtar messages. Individual channelers espousing messages which differed and continued to focus on themes such as the destruction of Earth, were declared invalid. It was claimed that channelers who had avowed such messages in the past and continued to do so, had in fact been deceived by spiritual forces who opposed Ashtar's benevolent intentions. Most significantly of all, the new more unified movement declared that in future no new channeled messages from Ashtar would be accepted as valid unless they complied with criteria established by the recently formed and authoritative core group. The criteria consisted of a set of twelve "guidelines", which it was claimed established a baseline of 'orthodoxy' for the movement. After the Southern Television broadcast hoax in 1977, they also began using the term "Ashtar Galactic Command" as opposed to simply "Ashtar Command". "Ashtar" came to be depicted as commanding a fleet of dozens to hundreds of flying saucers continually monitoring Earth, and the being "Vrillon" came to be depicted as Ashtar's communications director.

Pontchartrain Railroad

Pontchartrain Rail-Road was an early railway in New Orleans, Louisiana. Chartered in 1830, the railroad began traffic of people and goods between the Mississippi River front of New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain on 23 April 1831, and closed more than 100 years later. 
The long gauge line connected the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans along the riverfront with the town of Milneburg on the Lakefront. When built, the majority of the distance of the route between neighborhoods at either end of the route was a mixture of farmland, woods, and swamp. The route of the railway ran down the center of Elysian Fields Avenue. 
Early history.
Meetings discussing building a railway between the river and lake began in 1828. The Pontchartrain Rail-Road was chartered on 20 January 1830. The right-of-way was approved by the New Orleans City Council on 15 March, and construction began immediately, with a pair of parallel railroad tracks. Some of the route included swampland that required up to 4 feet of fill to create a sufficient road bed. A 150 foot wide bed was constructed along the entire route, with the rail line laid with red cypress timbers and English rolled iron rails. Construction of the line was completed on April 14, 1831, and it officially opened on the 23rd, with horse drawn railway carriages. The first steam locomotive, "the Shields", arrived on 15 June 1832. This first locomotive proved unreliable; a second locomotive "the Pontchartrain" proved better, allowing the line to advertise regular steam service of 7 round trips per day (9 on Sundays) starting on 27 September 1832. "The Shields" was canibalized, the boiler used to run equipment at the railroad's machine shop. 
At first, the passenger fare was 75 cents round trip. For some years both steam and horse drawn traffic ran on the line, with steam only gradually becoming dominant with the acquisition of additional more reliable locomotives. One horse drawn car was kept on the line as late as 1861, although the line at the time also had 5 working locomotives.
For much of the 19th century, a significant portion of sea traffic to New Orleans came in not via the river but to Lake Pontchartrain. Thus the railway was important in transferring cargo between ocean going ships docked at the lake and riverboats. Many passenger sea ships also arrived via the lake, and the railway took passengers the remainder of the way into the city.
For decades the passenger fare was 15 cents for a one way trip, 25 cents for a round trip. The railroad had terminals at the two ends of the line; stops would also be made at a small station at Gentilly Road, about the midpoint of the line, by advance request.
In 1871 the line was purchased by the New Orleans, Mobile and Texas Railroad.
In 1880 the Louisville and Nashville Railroad leased the line, and the following year purchased it outright.
The line switches from shipping to recreation.
In the late 19th century, the Pontchartrain Railroad became less important for commerce, as ships too large to use the Lakefront routes became common and the extensive network of long distance railways grew. However, at the same time, the line became more important for recreation. Especially during the long summer, excursions from the city out to the lakefront became common, to enjoy the cooling breezes and the entertainments at Milneberg. 
In the early 20th century rates were 10 cents for adults, 5 cents for children one way, and double for round trip.
Generations of New Orleanians fondly remembered the archaic veteran steam engine nicknamed "Smoky Mary" running on the line as late as the 1930s. The somewhat less outdated companion locomotive on the line was called "Puffing Billy".
Final years.
Thanks to the popularity of recreational excursions at Milneburg, business remained brisk for the Pontchartrain Railroad through the mid-1920s. After this, however, the railroad declined for two reasons. One was less demand for short distance rail passenger service with expansion of electric streetcar routes and growth in automobile ownership. The final straw, however, was the closing of the Milneburg resorts while a land reclamation project dredged earth into the shallows of lake Pontchartrain there in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The last passenger service of the line was on March 15, 1932, the line having been in business for over a century. 
Freight runs on the line continued to 1935, mostly servicing the Lakefront land reclamation project work which made the line obsolete.

<doc id="5987862" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987862" title="Roswell Railroad">
Roswell Railroad

The Roswell Railroad was a narrow gauge railroad that ran from south of Roswell, Georgia to Chamblee from 1881 until 1921. The railroad served as a passenger and freight carrier.
Overview.
Some accounts say the railroad had only a single combination passenger coach and baggage car, two box cars and four flat cars. (see Stepp citation plus garail.com citation, both below)
Since Roswell was a textile manufacturing town, the line would have brought in cotton and dry goods and shipped textile and farming products.
The Roswell terminus was located south of the Chattahoochee River near Roberts Drive and connected to the Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line Railway at its Chamblee terminus. At the South Roswell terminus, a bridge was planned, but never built. About 1/2 mile upstream, an old wagon road ran just west of the current River Landing Drive and Grimes Bridge Landing to connect to current day Grimes Bridge and Oxbo Roads and approached the textile mills from the north. Unfortunately, much of the old roadbed was destroyed when Fulton County installed a sewer line.
Ike Roberts was an employee of Southern Railway at the time the company decided to create the Roswell Railroad. Roberts participated in the grading and track laying for this new line. He also purchased of land at the northern terminus, built a train station, and leased it to Southern. After completion of the line, he stayed on as the engineer and was the only person that worked in that capacity until the closing of the line. His home still remains on Roberts Road (his namesake in the Dunwoody community).
As there was no facility to turn around in (South) Roswell, the engine traveled in reverse on the return trip to Chamblee.
Absorption.
The Roswell Railroad operated as an independent road until, in 1894, it was absorbed into the newly created Southern Railway. They had one narrow gauge steam locomotive numbered 815, an 0-6-0-arranged Baldwin 1878 steamer named "Buck" (builder construction number 4321). In 1894, Buck was renumbered N815 in the Southern numbering system. In 1905, the line was converted to and Buck was sold to the S.I.&E. Co.
In 1902, the Bull Sluice Railroad built a line from a junction with the Roswell Branch, just north of Dunwoody, to the Georgia Railway and Power Company's construction site for its hydroelectric Morgan Falls Dam (built to supply electricity to Atlanta's streetcar system, and creating Bull Sluice Lake). The line was built to bring in building materials. Later the Southern purchased this line and it became the Morgan Falls Branch. The Bull Sluice used a steamer named "Dinkey".
In 1905, the line hauled U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to Roswell to visit Bulloch Hall, the childhood home of his mother Martha Bulloch Roosevelt. [http://garail.com/roswell.html]

Fromelles

Fromelles () is a commune in the Nord department in northern France. In 2004 it had a population of 907; its inhabitants are called "Fromellois". It is located about to the west of Lille.
World War I.
The village of Fromelles was captured by advancing German forces on 9 October 1914 during the "Race to the Sea". Throughout almost the whole of the war, the front line was stable, running through the territory of the "commune" and leaving the inhabited area in German hands. The Battle of Aubers Ridge was fought in the area to the northwest of the village on 9 May 1915 as part of the Second Battle of Artois.
Battle of Fromelles.
The Battle of Fromelles on 19–20 July 1916 was the first occasion on which the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) saw action on the Western Front. The battle is widely regarded as a disaster for the Allies, and has been described as "the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history." It resulted from a plan to divert German attention from the Battle of the Somme, but historians estimate that 5,500 Australians and 2,000 British troops were killed or wounded. The Australian losses were equivalent to the combined total Australian losses in the Boer War, Korean War and Vietnam War: although later World War I actions would be more deadly for the AIF, Fromelles was the only one to achieve no success.
Adolf Hitler is believed to have served as a messenger on the German side with the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division.
Cemeteries.
Four hundred unidentified bodies retrieved from the battlefield by the Allies are buried in the V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial, about two kilometres from Fromelles. There are no headstones in the cemetery, two large concrete crosses marking where the 400 soldiers are buried.
Many bodies of Allied soldiers were retrieved by the German forces and buried behind German lines. Most of these were located after the war, but 399 bodies remained unaccounted for, despite the certainty of their death (the soldiers' names and personal belongings had been passed to their families via the Red Cross). In July 2007, archaeologists from Glasgow University, relying on information provided by an amateur Australian historian, Lambis Englezos, opened the largest mass grave of allied soldiers discovered since the end of the Great War in a field on the outskirts of Fromelles. Excavation of the mass graves was carried out May–September 2009, and the remains of 250 British and Australian soldiers recovered. The bodies were reburied in the new Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery, about 120 metres from the site of the original mass grave.
During the four years of the Great War, British division after division fought in that area of the Western Front which we now know as Fromelles and which forms part of what is now referred to as “The Forgotten Front”. Prior to the discovery of the mass graves at Pheasant Wood, Fromelles was known only for being the place where the Australian Imperial Force had experienced its first, and disastrous, taste of action on the Western Front. Whilst Fromelles hosts both the CWGC memorial to the AIF at VC Corner and the Australian Memorial Park, with the exception of a small private memorial to an officer of the Rifle Brigade, no memorial to the British casualties exists in this area. British losses were numbered in their many thousands in and along this line, but the majority of the men killed in action in this area between 1914 and 1918 are commemorated on the Ploegsteert Memorial to the Missing in Belgium. A charitable association, known as the British Memorial Association, Fromelles, has been set up to establish a memorial in Fromelles, dedicated to the thousands of British men who gave their lives in this small corner of France, by educating people about the magnificent efforts of the British Army in this area of the ‘Forgotten Front’, the Association will endeavour to redress this balance and should be the first port of call for anyone, regardless of nationality, who is interested in Aubers Ridge and Fromelles throughout the Great War.

<doc id="5987944" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987944" title="Kang Kang">
Kang Kang

Kang Jing Rong, or commonly known as Kang Kang, is a famous Taiwanese entertainer, singer, and television host. He was first discovered by the Taiwanese king of showbiz, Zhang Fei(張 菲 ) during a TV show performance. Before entering Taiwanese showbiz, Kang had switched many jobs. He was first a military policeman (MP), a salesman, then a pub singer for many years. He entered a singing contest in 1997 and won first place with his band. They released an EP in the same year.
Career.
It was not until 1998 that Kang got the chance to enter showbiz. Zhang Fei praised the young hard working Kang for his brilliant and quick-witted performance on his popular show, "Dragon Brother, Tiger Brother", saying that he had a bright future as an entertainer. As a result, Zhang Fei took the young comedian under his wings, and showed Kang what it took to become a great comedian. At the same time, Kang's fortune hit the jack pot when he was introduced to another Taiwanese TV host, Jacky Wu (吳 宗 憲 ), due to their common share of musical direction. They immediately signed a full-time contract. Thus Kang embarked on his first step towards conquering Taiwanese showbizz by homing his comical and musical skills under two iconic figures in the modern showbiz.
Kang released his first album, "Tears Inducing" (催 淚 ) in June 1999. The album was a mild success, due to his soul-searching musical direction and humble low-range vocal. However, Kang's brilliant music was overshadowed by his obnoxious TV image as a comedian who used foul language, impersonation and slapstick humour as a means to win the audience's heart. The general public tended to focus primarily on his on-screen presence, saying that a singer must have style and Kang was lacking the magic within a singer. The reason for that was not a lack of media exposure or TV coverage, it was due to Kang's public image. Critics had pounded him as "ugly looking and badly dressed, with a tumbling voice that can't speak with proper volume and speed". Kang had since been working diligently to improve his voice command and speed, as the hard work eventually paid off. His popularity climaxed as he gained more TV exposure from the support of his boss, Jackie Wu as they appeared in countless classic TV hits such as "TV Citizen", "Electric Playground" and "Let's Hancuff Him".
In 2000, Kang released his second album, "Happy Birdy Days" (快 樂 鳥 日 子 ). The response was overwhelming and produced many classic songs, such as "Happy Birdy Days", which is a must sing song in many karaoke places. In 2001, Kang released his third album, "Dream Come True" (圓 夢), and produced mild success. Following it was a 2002 live album, "Kang Kang's Special" (康 康的 濕背秀), which is his best album up to date.
Kang's career blossomed when he co-hosted with Jackie Wu on the hit-show "Sunday Night 8 o' Clock" (周 日 八 點 黨 ). The show was an instant hit, claiming as the sole champion during the Sunday late night TV slot for more than six years straight. Its popularity was due to its renovating structure from in-studio recording to outdoor recording. Adding to that was the introduction of "Crossroad" (食 字 路 口 ), the outdoor game element that leads a group of guests to famous night markets and restaurants. The game starts with 3 teams, each led by one TV host, and they must follow certain rules in order to win the race. The rule is simple: each team is first given a title of a single food item and then they must come out a series of 8 food items correlating to the last letter of each item, for example Fried Rice -> Rice Dumpling-> Dumpling And Noodle -> Noodle Soup...and so on. There is an option that grants a team to use 7-11 as a life-saver, but it can only be used once. This newly introduced element was a first in TV game shows, because the Taiwanese culture had its love for food and its night markets for a long time, and what better way to advertise the culture in front of a live audience. Kang was easily the star of the show, as he often mimicked famous stars and singers with his uncanny ability to sing and make eccentric facial expressions at the same time. Often his teammates would respond with tears and laughter during their brief stint as they went on during stages of the game. Coincidentally, Kang's team would often round up as the winner of the show, which later on generated mixed emotions with another host, "NONO". However, the show lasted a long run and ended in 2008.
In 2005, Kang released his fifth album, "Who Gives a Damn About Your Mother's Marriage" (管你媽媽嫁給誰). It did poorly in both commercial sales and critical acclaim. In the same year, Kang hit bottom low with his TV career, as he was kicked off from Zhang Fei's show "Big Brother in Showbizz" (綜藝大哥大) due to creative differences. Even though he had the most TV offers in the same year, his popularity declined due to negative tabloid exposure. Critics often panned him as "egotistically self-minded, a language abuser, and arrogant as a mule". Worse still is that he was often spotted in pubs and other adult-oriented places by paparazzi. He was also hampered by the media as a playboy, often hailing his own sexual prowess and innuendos in public. Kang responded with the remark that his behaviour was only for the sake of the show.
In the spring of 2006, Kang Kang reinvented his long-term negative image by losing some weight and concentrating on his own TV shows. In addition, he was romantically involved with his fellow TV assistant. Kang Kang married in 2011 and is now a father of one child. He is currently on tour with Taiwanese legendary singer, Gao Ling Feng and TV icon, Jacky Wu as "The Three Hard Tenors".

<doc id="5987957" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987957" title="Western saloon">
Western saloon

A Western saloon is a kind of bar particular to the Old West. Saloons served customers such as fur trappers, cowboys, soldiers, prospectors, miners, and gamblers. The first saloon was established at Brown's Hole, Wyoming, in 1822, to serve fur trappers. By the late 1850s the term saloon had begun to appear in directories and common usage as a term for an establishment that specialized in beer and liquor sales by the drink, with food and lodging as secondary concerns in some places. By 1880, the growth of saloons were in full swing. In Leavenworth, Kansas there were "about 150 saloons and four wholesale liquor houses".
History.
Saloons in America began to have a close association with breweries in the early 1880s. With a growing overcapacity, breweries began to adopt the British “tied-house” system of control where they owned saloons outright. Brewers purchased hundreds of storefronts, especially on the highly desired corner locations, which they rented to prospective saloon keepers, along with furnishings and recreational equipment such as billiard tables and bowling alleys. Schlitz Brewing Company and a few others built elaborate saloons to attract customers and advertise their beers.
Legislative factors also played a factor in the growth of brewery owned saloons. The Chicago City Council increased the saloon license from $50 to $500 between 1883 and 1885 to pay for an expanded police force made necessary by the barrooms. Relatively few independent proprietors could afford to pay such amounts.
Politicians also frequented local saloons because of the adaptable social nature of their business. In neighborhoods where literacy was low, the bar provided the principal place for the exchange of information about employment and housing. A savvy politician could turn his access to resources into votes. In factory districts, saloons became labor exchanges and union halls, as well as providing a place to cash paychecks.
Beginning in 1893, the Anti-Saloon League began protesting against American saloons. In 1895 it became a national organization and quickly rose to become the most powerful prohibition lobby in America, pushing aside its older competitors the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Prohibition Party. The League lobbied at all levels of government for legislation to prohibit the manufacture or import of spirits, beer and wine. Ministers had launched several efforts to close Arizona saloons after the 1906 creation of League chapters in Yuma, Tucson, and Phoenix. League members pressured local police to take licenses from establishments that violated closing hours or served women and minors, and they provided witnesses to testify about these violations. Its triumph was nationwide prohibition locked into the Constitution with passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920. It was decisively defeated when prohibition was repealed in 1933.
The traditional saloon was declining many years before Prohibition. The automobile took patronage away from the pedestrian institution. Nickelodeons also competed for the entertainment niche. An increasing numbers of employers demanded abstinence during the workday. City health departments also enacted regulations that eliminated many features of the free lunch table. Finally, World War I brought not only an attack on anything that seemed remotely German but also a temporary ban on brewing.
Free lunch.
The free lunch was a sales enticement to offer a meal at no cost in order to attract customers and increase revenues from other offerings. It was a tradition once common in saloons in many places in the United States, with the phrase appearing in U.S. literature from about 1870 to the 1920s. These establishments included a "free" lunch, varying from rudimentary to quite elaborate, with the purchase of at least one drink. These free lunches were typically worth far more than the price of a single drink. The saloon-keeper relied on the expectation that most customers would buy more than one drink, and that the practice would build patronage for other times of day.
Appearance.
A saloon's appearance varied from when and where it grew. As towns grew, the saloons became more refined. The bartender prided himself on his appearance and his drink pouring abilities. Early saloons and those in remote locations were often crude affairs with minimal furniture and few decorations. A single wood-burning stove might warm such establishments during the winter months.
A pair of "batwing" doors at the entrance was one of the more distinctive features of the typical saloon. The doors operated on double action hinges and extended from chest to knee level. 
As travelers made their way West, some sold liquor from wagons, and saloons were often formed of materials at hand, including ""sod houses. . . . a hull of an old sailing ship"" or interiors ""dug into the side of a hill"".
As towns grew, many hotels included saloons, and some stand-alone saloons, such as the Barlow Trail Saloon in Damascus, Oregon, featured a railed porch.
Saloons' appearance varied by ethnic group. The Irish preferred stand-up bars where whiskey was the drink of choice and women could obtain service only through the back door. German saloons were more brightly illuminated, more likely to serve restaurant food and beer at tables, and more oriented toward family patronage. Germans were often at odds with Temperance forces over Sunday operation and over the operation of beer gardens in outlying neighborhoods. Other ethnic groups added their own features and their unique cuisines on the sideboard, while a few groups, most notably Scandinavians, Jews, Greeks, and Italians, either preferred intimate social clubs or did little drinking in public.
Entertainment.
By way of entertainment, saloons offered dancing girls, some of whom occasionally or routinely doubled as prostitutes. Many saloons offered Faro, poker, brag, three-card monte, and dice games. Other games were added as saloons continued to prosper and face increasing competition. These additional games included billiards, darts, and bowling. Some saloons even included piano players, can-can girls, and theatrical skits. A current example of this type of entertainment is the Long Branch Variety Show that is presented in the recreated Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas.
Alcohol.
When a town was first founded, the initial saloons were often nothing more than tents or shacks that served homemade whiskey that included such ingredients as ""raw alcohol, burnt sugar and chewing tobacco"".
To stretch their profits, saloon owners would cut good whiskey with turpentine, ammonia, gunpowder or cayenne. Their custom product was called by names like ""Tanglefoot, Forty-Rod, Tarantula Juice, Taos Lightning, Red Eye, and Coffin Varnish."" Other offerings included Cactus Wine, made from a mix of tequila and peyote tea, and Mule Skinner, made with whiskey and blackberry liquor. A saloon might also be known as a ""watering trough, bughouse, shebang, cantina, grogshop, and gin mill"".
As towns grew, saloons were often elaborately decorated, featured Bohemian stemware, and oil paintings were hung from the wall. The hard liquor was improved, often featuring whiskey imported from the eastern United States and Europe. To avoid rotgut, patrons would request "fancy" mixed drinks. Some of the top ten drinks in 1881 included claret sangarees and champagne flips.
Beer was often served at room temperature since refrigeration was mostly unavailable. Adolphus Busch introduced refrigeration and pasteurization of beer in 1880 with his Budweiser brand. Some saloons kept the beer in kegs stored on racks inside the saloon. Some saloons made their own beer.
Notable saloons.
Among the more familiar saloons were First Chance Saloon in Miles City, Montana; the Bull's Head in Abilene, Kansas; the Arcade Saloon in Eldora, Colorado; the Holy Moses in Creede, Colorado; the Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas; the Birdcage Theater in Tombstone, Arizona; the Bucket of Blood Saloon in Virginia City, Nevada; and the Jersey Lilly in Langtry, Texas. Many of these establishments remained open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
Bull's Head.
Among the anecdotes of the American West, several notable events took place in or outside saloons. One such incident occurred at the Bull's Head in Abilene, Kansas. When the tavern's owner, Phil Coe, outraged the townspeople by painting a bull, complete with an erect penis, or pizzle, on the outside wall of his tavern, Wild Bill Hickok, the marshal at the time, threatened to burn the saloon to the ground if the offending animal was not painted over. Instead, he hired some men to do the job, which angered Coe. The two became enemies and in a later altercation, Wild Bill Hickok killed Coe.
Wild Bill, also a professional lawman, gunfighter, and gambler, was later killed on August 2, 1876 by Jack McCall, who shot him in the back of the head, in Saloon No. 10, in Deadwood, South Dakota as Wild Bill was playing cards. His hand—aces and eights, according to tradition—has become known as the "dead man's hand".
Wyatt Earp's saloons.
Former lawman, faro dealer, and gambler Wyatt Earp worked in or owned several saloons during his lifetime, outright or in partnership with others. He and two of his brothers arrived in Tombstone, Arizona on December 1, 1879 and during January 1881, Oriental Saloon owner Lou Rickabaugh gave Wyatt Earp a one-quarter interest in the faro concession at the Oriental Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer. Wyatt invited his friend, lawman and gambler Bat Masterson, to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in the Oriental Saloon. In 1884, after leaving Tombstone, Wyatt and his wife Josie, Warren, James and Bessie Earp went to Eagle, Idaho, another boom town. Wyatt was looking for gold in the Murray-Eagle mining district. They opened a saloon called The White Elephant in a circus tent. An advertisement in a local newspaper suggested gentlemen ""come and see the elephant"".
In 1885, Earp and Josie moved to San Diego where the railroad was about to arrive and a real estate boom was underway. They stayed for about four years. Earp speculated in San Diego's booming real estate market. Between 1887 and around 1896 he bought three saloons and gambling halls, one on Fourth Street and the other two near Sixth and E, all in the "respectable" part of town. They offered twenty-one games including faro, blackjack, poker, keno, and other Victorian games of chance like pedro and monte. At the height of the boom, he made up to $1,000 a night in profit. Wyatt particularly favored and may have run the Oyster Bar located in the Louis Bank of Commerce on Fifth Avenue.
In the fall of 1897, Earp and Josie joined in the Alaska Gold Rush and headed for Nome, Alaska. He operated a canteen during the summer of 1899 and in September, Earp and partner Charles Ellsworth Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon in Nome, Alaska, the city's first two story wooden building and its largest and most luxurious saloon. The building was used for a variety of purposes because it was so large: with ceilings.
Wyatt and Josie returned to California in 1901 with an estimated $80,000. In February 1902, they arrived in Tonopah, Nevada, where gold had been discovered and a boom was under way. He opened the Northern Saloon in Tonopah, Nevada and served as a deputy U.S. Marshal under Marshal J.F. Emmitt. His saloon, gambling and mining interests were profitable for a period.

Julia Lennon

Julia Lennon (née Stanley; 12 March 1914 – 15 July 1958) was the mother of English musician John Lennon, who was born during her marriage to Alfred Lennon. After complaints to Liverpool's Social Services by her eldest sister, Mimi Smith (née Stanley), she handed over the care of her son to her sister. She later had one daughter after an affair with a Welsh soldier, but the baby was given up for adoption after pressure from her family. She then had two daughters, Julia and Jackie, with John 'Bobby' Dykins. She never divorced her husband, preferring to live as the common-law wife of Dykins for the rest of her life.
She was known as being high-spirited and impulsive, musical, and having a strong sense of humour. She taught her son how to play the banjo and ukulele, and bought his first acoustic guitar, even though her eldest sister strongly disapproved. She kept in almost daily contact with Lennon, and when he was in his teens he often stayed overnight at her and Dykins' house. On 15 July 1958, she was struck down and killed by a car driven by an off-duty policeman, close to her sister's house at 251 Menlove Avenue. Lennon was traumatised by her death and wrote several songs about her, including "Julia" and "Mother". Biographer Ian MacDonald wrote that she was, "to a great extent ... her son's muse".
Background.
Julia Stanley, later known by the family as Judy, was born at 8 Head Street, Toxteth, South Liverpool in 1914, and was the fourth of five sisters. Her mother, Annie Jane (née Millward), gave birth to a boy and then a girl, both of whom died shortly after birth. She then had Mary, known as 'Mimi' (1903–1991), Elizabeth 'Mater' (1908–1976), Anne 'Nanny' (1911–1988), Julia 'Judy' (1914–1958), and Harriet 'Harrie' (1916–1972). John Lennon would later comment that the 'Stanley girls' were "five, fantastic, strong, beautiful, and intelligent women". Their father, George Ernest Stanley, retired from the Merchant Navy and found a job with the Liverpool & Glasgow Salvage Association as an insurance investigator. He moved his family to the suburb of Woolton, where they lived in a small terraced house at 9 Newcastle Road near to Penny Lane. Her mother died in 1945, and Julia had to take care of her father with help from her oldest sister.
Marriage to Alf Lennon.
Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon—always called 'Alf' by his family—was always joking but never held a job for very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many vaudeville theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name. At the Trocadero club, a converted cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool, he first saw an "auburn-haired girl with a bright smile and high cheekbones"; Julia Stanley. He saw her again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Lennon, who was dressed in a bowler hat and with a cigarette holder in hand, saw "this little waif" sitting on a wrought-iron bench. Julia (14 years old) said that his hat looked "silly", to which the 15-year-old Alf replied that she looked "lovely", and sat down next to her. She asked him to take off his hat, so he promptly threw it straight into the Sefton Park lake.
Despite standing only five feet two inches tall in heels, she often caught the gaze of men in the street, being attractive and full-figured. She was always well-dressed and even went to bed with make-up on so as to "look beautiful when she woke up". A nephew later said that she could "make a joke out of nothing", and could have "walked out of a burning house with a smile and a joke". She frequented Liverpool's dance halls and clubs where she was often asked to dance in jitterbug competitions with dockers, soldiers, sailors, and waiters. It was remarked that she could be as humorous as any man and would sing the popular songs of the day at any time of day or night. Her voice sounded similar to Vera Lynn's, whilst Lennon specialised in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. She played the ukelele, the piano accordion, and the banjo (as did Lennon), although neither pursued music professionally. They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and talking of what they would do in the future: opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club.
On 3 December 1938, 11 years after they had first met, she married Alf Lennon after she had proposed to him. They were married in the Bolton Street Registry office, although none of her family were present as she had not informed them about the wedding. She wrote 'cinema usherette' as her occupation on the marriage certificate, even though she had never been one. They spent their honeymoon eating at Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where their son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), and then went to a cinema. She walked into 9 Newcastle Road waving the marriage licence and said to her family, "There!—I've married him." It was an act of defiance against her father, who had threatened to disown her if she ever cohabitated with a lover. On their wedding night, she stayed at her parents' house, and Lennon went back to his boarding house. The next day, he went back to sea for three months, on a ship bound for the West Indies.
The Stanley family completely ignored her husband at first, believing him to be of "no use to anyone—certainly not our Julia". Her father demanded that Lennon present something concrete to show that he could financially support his daughter, but Lennon signed on as a Merchant Navy steward on a ship bound for the Mediterranean. He returned after a few months at sea and moved into the Stanley home. He auditioned for local theatre managers as an entertainer but had no success. Julia found out that she was pregnant (with John) in January 1940, but as the war had started her husband continued to serve as a merchant seaman during World War II, sending money home regularly. The payments stopped after Alf deserted in 1943.
John.
Julia gave birth to John Winston Lennon on 9 October 1940, in the second-floor ward of the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital in Liverpool, during World War II. Her eldest sister, Mimi, phoned the hospital and was told that she had given birth to a boy. Mimi would later claim that she went straight to the hospital during the middle of an air raid and was forced to hide in doorways to avoid the shrapnel from falling bombs, but in actuality, there had been no attack on Liverpool that night. Lennon was named after his paternal grandfather, and Winston Churchill. Alf was not present at Lennon's birth, as he was at sea.
The infant Lennon started at his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so she found a part-time job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services to complain about the infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July 1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251 Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child had to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.
She took John back to her house and enrolled him in a local school, but after few weeks she handed him back to Mimi. Various reasons have been suggested for her decision, such as Dykins' unwillingness to raise the young boy, Julia's inability to cope with the responsibility, or a punishment forced on her by Mimi and her father for "living in sin". Lennon blamed himself, saying later, "My mother ... couldn't cope with me." He then lived continuously at 'Mendips', in the smallest bedroom above the front door, with Mimi determined to give him a "proper upbringing". Julia later bought Lennon his first guitar for £5/10- (five pounds, ten shillings) after Lennon had pestered her incessantly for weeks, but insisted it had to be delivered to her house, not her sister's. As Lennon had difficulty learning chords, she taught him banjo and ukulele chords, which were simpler, and later taught Lennon how to play the piano accordion. Julia's banjo was the first instrument that John learned to play 'sitting there with endless patience until I managed to work out all the chords.' After Julia's untimely death the instrument was never seen again and its whereabouts remains a mystery.
As Mimi refused to have a record player in her house, Lennon learned how to play his favourite songs by going to Julia's house. She played Elvis records to Lennon and would dance around her kitchen with him. In 1957, when The Quarrymen played at St. Barnabas Hall, Penny Lane, Julia turned up to watch. After each song she would clap and whistle louder than everyone else and was seen "swaying and dancing" throughout the whole concert. Lennon frequently visited her house during that period, detailing his anxieties and problems, where she gave him encouragement to continue with music over Mimi's objection
Victoria.
During 1942–1943, Julia lived with her son at "The Dairy Cottage"; 120a Allerton Road, Woolton. The cottage was owned by Mimi's husband, and Mimi wanted Julia to live there because they would be closer to her house and also out of the Stanley house. As Alf was often away at sea, Julia started going out to dance halls. In 1942, she met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was stationed in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf later blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling her that because there was a war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. After an evening out, she would often give her young son a piece of chocolate or shortcrust pastry the next morning for breakfast. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier. Williams refused to live with Julia— who was still married to Alf— until she gave up John, which she refused to do. When Alf eventually came home in 1944, he offered to look after his wife, their son, and the expected baby, but she rejected the idea.
Alf took John to his brother Sydney's house, in the Liverpool suburb of Maghull, a few months before Julia came to term. Julia's daughter, Victoria Elizabeth, born in the Elmswood Nursing Home on 19 June 1945, was subsequently given up for adoption to a Norwegian Salvation Army Captain and his wife (Peder and Margaret Pedersen) after intense pressure from the Stanley family. Lennon was not told about Victoria's birth—who was later renamed Ingrid Marie Pedersen—and it is not known if he ever knew of her existence.
John 'Bobby' Dykins.
Julia started seeing Dykins a year after Victoria's birth (although they had known each other before) when she was working in the café near Lennon's primary school; Mosspits. Dykins was a good-looking, well-dressed man who worked at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool as a wine steward. She later moved into a small flat in Gateacre with Dykins. He enjoyed luxuries, and had access to rationed goods like alcohol, chocolate, silk stockings and cigarettes, which was what initially attracted her. The Stanley sisters called him "Spiv", because of his pencil-thin moustache, margarine-coated hair, and pork-pie hat, and the young Lennon called him "Twitchy" because of a physical tic/nervous cough. Julia's family and friends remembered that he also had a fiery temperament, which could result in his being violent when drunk. Lennon remembered seeing his mother during a visit to Mimi's, when her face was bleeding after being hit by Dykins.
Paul McCartney later stated that Julia living in sin with Dykins while she was still married was a point of social ostracization for Lennon, as it was often used as a "cheap shot" against him. Although Julia never divorced Alf, she was considered to be the common-law wife of Dykins. She wanted Lennon to live with them both, but he was passed between the Stanley sisters and often ran away to Mimi's, where she would open the door to find Lennon standing there, "his face covered in tears". Julia was accused by the family of being frivolous and unreliable— she never enjoyed household chores— and was once seen sweeping the kitchen floor with a pair of knickers on her head. Her cooking methods were also haphazard, as she would mix things "like a mad scientist", and even put tea "or anything else that came to hand" in a stew. A favourite joke would be to wear a pair of spectacles that had no glass in them, and then to scratch her eye through the empty frame. 
Dykins later managed several bars in Liverpool, which allowed Julia to stay at home and look after their two daughters (Julia and Jackie) and Lennon, who often visited and stayed overnight, at 1 Blomfield Road, Liverpool. Lennon and McCartney would rehearse in the bathroom of the house where the acoustics "sounded like a recording studio". Dykins used to give Lennon weekly pocket money (one shilling) for doing odd jobs, on top of the five shillings that Mimi gave him. In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane, but Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards, as it was "not family business".
Julia and Jackie.
Julia had two daughters with Dykins: Julia Baird (née Dykins - b. 5 March 1947) and Jacqueline (Jackie) Dykins (b. 26 October 1949). As Jackie was born prematurely, her mother visited the hospital every day to see her.
When Lennon was 11 years old, he started to visit the Dykins' house, and often stayed overnight. Baird would give up her bed to him, then share her sister's bed. Baird remembered that after Lennon had visited them, her mother would often play a record called, "My Son John, To Me You Are So Wonderful", "by some old crooner, and sit and listen to it". probably meant "My Son John"—sung by David Whitfield—which was released in 1956.
After Julia's death, the two girls (aged eleven and eight) were sent to stay in Edinburgh at Aunt Mater's and were only told two months later by Norman Birch (Lennon's uncle) that their mother had died. 
The commercial success of the Beatles allowed Lennon to buy a 4-bedroomed house in Gateacre Park Drive, Liverpool, for Baird and Jackie to live in with Lennon's Aunt Harriet and Birch. They had previously been made legal guardians of the two girls; Dykins' parentage had been disregarded as he had never legally married Julia. After Lennon's death and Harriet died, Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono, wanted to sell the house— as it was still in Lennon's name— but she later gave it to the Salvation Army on 2 November 1993, even though Lennon had once written a letter, stating: "I always thought of the house he's in as my contribution towards looking after Julia [Baird and Jackie. I would prefer the girls to use it."
Baird and Jackie later met their half-sister, Victoria/Ingrid, when they were present at the ceremony to place a Blue Heritage plaque on Mimi's house to commemorate the fact that Lennon had lived there. Stanley Parkes (Lennon's cousin) was on the ladder fixing the plaque to the wall and said, "I think I can see Ingrid" towards the house. Baird and her sister were surprised, as it meant that Parkes had seen Ingrid before, even though Baird and Jackie never had. When all three finally met for the first time Baird was shocked that Ingrid did not look anything like the Stanley family, as she had "pale blue eyes and fair hair".
Death.
Julia visited Mimi's house nearly every day, where they would chat over tea and cakes in the morning room or stand in the garden when it was warm. On the evening of 15 July 1958, Nigel Walley went to visit Lennon and found Julia and Mimi talking by the front gate. Lennon was not there, as he was at the Blomfield Road house. Walley accompanied Julia to the bus stop further north along Menlove Avenue, with her telling jokes along the way. At about 9:30, Walley left her to walk up Vale Road and she crossed Menlove Avenue to the central reservation between two traffic lanes, which was lined with hedges that covered disused tram tracks. Five seconds later, Walley heard "a loud thud", and turned to see her body "flying through the air"—which landed about 100 feet from where she had been hit. He ran back to get Mimi and they waited for the ambulance, with Mimi crying hysterically.
Julia was struck and killed by a Standard Vanguard car, driven by an off-duty constable, PC Eric Clague, who was a learner-driver. Clague was acquitted of all charges and given a short suspension from duty. When Mimi heard the verdict she was so incensed that she shouted ""Murderer!"" at Clague. Clague later left the police force and became a postman. Coincidentally, in 1964, part of his round was to deliver bags of fan mail to the McCartney house at 20 Forthlin Road.
Lennon could not bring himself to look at his mother's corpse when he was taken to the Sefton General Hospital, and was so distraught that he put his head on Mimi's lap throughout the funeral service. Lennon refused to talk to Walley for months afterwards, and Walley felt that Lennon somehow held him responsible. She was buried in Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool. Her gravesite was for some time unmarked, but it was recently identified as "CE (Church of England) 38-805". The graveyard's location is approx. 1.19 miles east of 1 Blomfield Road. Baird said that the Stanley family hoped to finally put a headstone on her mother's grave, which she hoped "will be a private affair for the family and not for the public". A headstone was later placed on Julia's grave (replacing a wooden cross), with the words "Mummy, John, Victoria, Julia, Jackie" inscribed.
Influence on John Lennon.
Her death traumatised the teenaged Lennon and, for the next two years, he drank heavily and frequently got into fights, consumed by a "blind rage". It contributed to the emotional difficulties that haunted him for much of his life, but also served to draw him closer to McCartney, who had also lost his mother at a young age. Julia's memory inspired songs such as the 1968 Beatles song "Julia", with its dreamlike imagery of "hair of floating sky glimmering", recalling Lennon's boyhood memories of his mother. Lennon remarked that the song "was sort of a combination of Yoko and my mother blended into one". "Mother" and "My Mummy's Dead" were both written under the influence of Arthur Janov's "Primal Scream" therapy, and released on his solo album "John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band" in 1970. Lennon's first son, Julian, born in 1963, was named after her.
Portrayals on film.
She was portrayed by Christine Cavanaugh in "" (2000), and by Anne-Marie Duff in "Nowhere Boy" (2009).

Jerry-Christian Tchuissé

Jerry-Christian Tchuissé (born 13 January 1975) is a retired Cameroonian football fullback, who holds Russian citizenship. He used to play for Chernomorets Novorossiysk, Spartak Moscow, FC Moscow, FC Terek Grozny and FC Vityaz Podolsk.
Club career.
In 1997, after playing some amateur football in Cameroon, Tchuisse moved to Russia. After unsuccessfully trying to get into a university in Krasnodar due to unimpressive grades and drug abuse, Tchuisse was spotted by the coach of an amateur side "Neftyannik", from the nearby Goryachy Klyuch, while playing football with his friends. Less than half a year later, his impressive displays for the Krasnodar Krai team, at an exhibition event, earned him his first professional contract and a move to the Russian Top Division ("as it was known at the time") side Chernomorets Novorossiysk.
During his time at Novorossiysk, Tchuisse received a career-threatening injury, after a bad challenge by Valery Kechinov. Tchuisse recovered and soon signed for the league champions Spartak Moscow.
With Spartak, the Cameroonian won two domestic league titles. In 2000, Tchuisse made his European debut in the UEFA Champions League. Tense relations with his teammates, however, forced the player to look for a move away. Tchuisse was linked with a possible move to RC Lens, but no deal ever materialized and the player, eventually, returned to Chernomorets Novorossiysk. After the club's relegation to the Russian First Division, Tchuisse received an offer from the newly formed ambitious FC Moscow.
During his three-year spell at the Moscow club, Tchuisse scored his first professional goal. His two goals for FC Moscow still remain his only goals scored for a professional club.
In 2007 and 2008, he played for FC Terek Grozny and FC Vityaz Podolsk respectively.
Tchuissé currently resides in Le Mans, France. There he coaches a local team, Le Mans Gazelec Sports, and has business in Cameroon.
International career.
Tchuissé obtained Russian citizenship in 2000 and was a candidate to play for the Russia national team. He even participated in team training. However, he has not played for Russia and debuted for Cameroon on 6 May 2001.

<doc id="5987970" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5987970" title="Clan Cochrane">
Clan Cochrane

Clan Cochrane is a Lowland Scottish clan. 
History.
Origins.
Traditionally the original ancestor of the Clan Cochrane in Scotland was a Scandinavian Viking who settled in what is now known as Renfrewshire, between the eighth and tenth centuries. It is evident that the name is of territorial origin and that the Cochranes took the name of the lands in the ancient Barony of Cochrane. The origin of the name itself is believed to be derived from two Gaelic words which jointly mean "The Roar of the Battle" or "Battle Cry". The Cochranes took the boar as their heraldic beast, in keeping with the character of their traditional ancestor. The three boars heads adorning the chief's shield are said to represent the exploits of a warrior who killed three of the beasts who were terrorizing the countryside.
Another traditional origin of the name Cochrane is that it comes from when an early member of the family fought in battle with such bravery that his leader singled him out from the others and clapped him on the shoulder calling him "coch ran" which means "brave fellow".
The Cochranes do not appear on any written record until 1262 when the name of Waldenus de Coveran occurs on an ancient charter for a grant of land to Walter Stewart the Earl of Menteith. This is the first certain record of the name.
Other early bearers of the name are William "de Coughran" in 1296; and Robert "de Cochrane" in about 1360. The name of 1296 appears in the Ragman Rolls swearing fealty to Edward I of England. 
14th, 15th and 16th centuries.
In 1346 John de Coveran appears as a witness in the election of an Abbot of Paisley. Goseline de Cochran appears as a witness to several grants made by Robert the Steward to Paisley Abbey in 1366. 
Thomas Cochrane (later to become an Earl of Mar (1458-79) constructed most of what is still standing of Auchindoun Castle. It was passed to the Clan Ogilvy in 1489 and from them to the Clan Gordon in 1535.
In 1456 Robert Cochrane of Cochrane resigned the lands of Cochrane to his successor Allen Cochrane who received a charter from King James II of Scotland. Edward Cochrane was accused but cleared of having anything to do with the detention of King James III of Scotland at Edinburgh Castle in 1482.

Both were taken prisoner at the Battle of Prestonpans in 1745. However on the Jacobite side William Cochrane of Ferguslie shared in the victory. In October 1745the seventh Earl of Dundonald had his horse shot from underneath him by Jacobites at the West Port, Edinburgh. 
Later throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the Cochranes distinguished themselves in both land and naval forces, and came to be nicknamed the "Fighting Cochranes.

The most noteworthy of these fighting Cochranes was Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775–1860) who joined the Royal Navy at the age of 18. The high point of his career was when a brig under his command with a crew of only fifty-four managed to capture a Spanish frigate with a crew of over three hundred sailors and 32 heavy guns. He followed this by defending Trinidad Castle against the French in 1808. He later became the commander of Chile's navy and assisted that country, along with Peru, Brazil and Greece, to become independent. He was known as Lord Cochrane. He is buried at Westminster Abbey in Westminster, London.
