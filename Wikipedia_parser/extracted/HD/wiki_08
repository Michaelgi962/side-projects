Elizabeth Price (gymnast)

Elizabeth "Ebee" Nicole Price (born May 28, 1996) is a former American artistic gymnast. Price was an alternate for the USA 2012 Summer Olympics Gymnastics team and an alternate for the 2013 USA World Artistic Gymnastics Championships Team. She was a member of the US Junior National gymnastics team from 2010 until she qualified for senior elite status in 2012.
Personal life.
Elizabeth Nicole Price was born on May 28, 1996 in Plainfield, New Jersey to David and Diane Price and has two younger brothers named Ethan and Elijah. She is home-schooled and takes classes online, allowing her to dedicate much of her time to training for elite gymnastics.
Price began gymnastics at the age of three years old, when her parents decided she needed an activity toward which to channel her energy.
In 2011, Price broke her big toe after competing at City of Jesolo Trophy meet in Jesolo, Italy. She underwent surgery to reconstruct the toe.
Elizabeth signed the National Letter of Intent to Stanford University. She will be competing for the Gymnastics team and will join Stanford in the fall of 2014
Junior career.
2008.
Price competed in the junior division of the 2008 US Classics, ranking 20th all-around. She was ranked 12th on vault, 22nd on both the uneven bars and balance beam, and 17th on floor exercise.
Price qualified to the junior elite level, and competed in the junior division at the US Nationals, placing 27th all-around. Vault continued to be her best event, where she ranked 13th by the end of day one and dropped to 14th place after the second day. She ranked 28th on uneven bars on both nights, but dropped from 15th place to 22nd on the balance beam over the course of the two nights of competition. She placed 26th on day one of floor exercise, but moved up to finish in 24th place on that apparatus by the second night.
2012 Olympic teammate Jordyn Wieber took first place at the US Classics and Nationals.
2009.
Price took part in four invitationals in addition to the 2009 American Classic, a junior qualifying event for the Visa Championships (also known as the US Nationals). She won the all-around title at her gym's Parkette Invitational, and went on to win first place on vault and second place in the all-around competition at the Maryland Classics. She then competed at the Fiesta Bowl Invitational and achieved the same results in addition to a first place win on floor exercise. Later in the year, Price competed at the International Gymnix Junior Cup in Montreal, where she won the all-around title. She scored the highest on vault and floor, finishing third on the bars and second on balance beam during the event finals, and tied for first place on floor. Once again, Jordyn Wieber swept all four event finals to win first place on every apparatus.
At the 2009 American classic, she ranked in the top 20 competitors but failed to qualify for the 2009 Visa Championships.
2010.
In early 2010, Price participated in the Bieger's National Elite qualifier where she attained junior elite status for the second time since 2008. She finished first on vault and won the all-around competition. Price then competed at the US Covergirl Classic in Chicago, where she placed 7th on vault and 15th overall. These wins once again qualified her for the Visa Championships, this time in Hartford, Connecticut. There, she finished 13th in the all-around and earned a spot on the US Junior Nationals team for the first time alongside future Olympic teammates McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas, Kyla Ross, Jordyn Wieber, and fellow alternate Sarah Finnegan.
2011.
Price once again competed in her hometown gym's Parkette Invitational, claiming first in the all-around as well as on the balance beam, uneven bars, and vault. In March, Price was chosen to compete for the US at the City of Jesolo Trophy in Jesolo, Italy. There, she contributed to the United States' team's first-place win above Russia and Italy. She personally placed third on vault and fourth on balance beam, placing seventh in the all-around. After competition, she broke her big toe and required reconstructive surgery.
She recovered quickly and traveled to Chicago to compete in the 2011 CoverGirl Classic. She competed on only two events to spare her toe, and tied for third place on the uneven bars with fellow 2012 Olympic alternate Sarah Finnegan.
She qualified for the Visa Championships for the third time, and traveled to St. Paul, Minnesota for competition. Price finished eleventh in the all-around competition, placing fifth on vault and fourth on the uneven bars. She was named to the US Junior Nationals team for the second consecutive year with Kyla Ross and Sarah Finnegan. Douglas, Wieber, and Maroney met the age requirement for the Senior national team and were therefore appointed to that roster instead, joining Aly Raisman.
Senior career.
2012.
Price kicked off her first year as a senior international elite by competing once again in the Parkette Invitational, scoring a perfect 10 on vault. She finished first on every apparatus except on balance beam, where she placed second.
In March, Price was chosen for the second consecutive year to represent the United States at the City of Jesolo Trophy in Italy, where the team defended their title by winning first place. Individually she scored second on vault, fifth and sixth on floor exercise and the all-around respectively, seventh on the uneven bars and seventeenth on the balance beam.
In May, Price competed at the Secret US Classic in Chicago, Illinois.Price placed second on vault, fourth on the uneven bars, twentieth on balance beam, eleventh on floor exercise, and fifth in the all-around. These scores allowed her to qualify for the Visa Championships, her first time doing so in the senior division.
In June, Price competed at the Visa Championships in St.Louis, Missouri. On day one of competition, she placed second on vault once again, seventh on bars, ninth on beam, sixth on floor, and fifth all-around. On day two, Price finished eighth and ninth on bars and beam respectively and fifth on floor exercise and in the all-around. Following the 2012 Visa Championships Price was invited to compete at the 2012 US Olympic Trials.
In July, Price competed at the 2012 Olympic Trials and placed fourth all-around. Price was named as a team alternate to the USA Olympic Gymnastics Team alongside Anna Li and Sarah Finnegan. Following Trials Price stated "I'm really excited to go to London. I think I'm most excited about representing my gym at the Olympics, I felt really confident going in. I especially felt great about my floor routine, since that's my best event." Coach Bill Strauss said of Price, "I think it's fantastic. I think it will give her great experience internationally... She grew up with us. She's like our surrogate daughter."
In the 2012-13 season, Elizabeth was ranked 2nd in the WCII All Around World Rankings behind Germany's Elisabeth Seitz
2013.
Price was slated to compete at the 2013 American Cup, but withdrew due to a strained hip muscle. She cited her desire to be healthy for future competitions, such as the Visa National Championships and World Championships, as her reason for withdrawing given that this was a relatively minor injury.
Price resumed training in April 2013 subsequently injuring the opposite hip. She was still recovering from that injury and unable to compete at the 2013 Secret US Classic.
In August, Price was able to compete at the 2013 P&G Championships in Hartford, Connecticut. Price, however did not compete all four events due to lack of training because of injury. Price competed vault and uneven bars. Price finished eighth on uneven bars. Following the P&G Championships Price was named to the USA Senior National Team. Price was also invited to the qualifying camp for the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Huntsville, Texas. Following the camp Price was named as the non-traveling alternate to the United States team for the 2013 World Gymnastics Championships.

Cerdd dafod

Cerdd dafod (literally "tongue craft") is the Welsh tradition of creating verse or poetry to a strict metre in the Welsh language.
History.
The history of "cerdd dafod" can be traced to 6th century Welsh poets such as Aneirin and Taliesin, but is probably much older. Studies also suggest that features of this form of poetry are comparable to the ancient Irish versificiations and therefore point to an older shared Celtic inheritance. "Cerdd dafod" strictly follows the rules laid out in cynghanedd, a strict concept of sound-arrangement within one line, using stress, alliteration and internal-rhyme. 
One of the earliest texts on the subject is credited to Einion Offeiriad (fl c.1320-c.1349) a bard considered to have been under the patronage of Rhys ap Gruffudd. In it, he lists 24 canonical metres used for all poems in the writing of "cerdd dafod". This was later revised by Dafydd ap Edmwnd who, in an eisteddfod held at Carmarthen circa 1450, changed two of the Offeiriad's metres to two more complicated versions of his own. These changes were adopted by future competitions as the preferred canon.
In 1925 the Celtic linguist Sir John Morris-Jones published "Cerdd Dafod", an in-depth study of the traditional metres of the "cynghanedd" and a text now seen as the definitive work on the topic. This was brought about after his desire to see a return to traditional poetry and use of strict metre in "eistedfoddau". The end of the twentieth century saw a renaissance in "cerdd dafod", especially in the metres known as Englyn and Cywydd, attributed to the poet Alan Llwyd.

Gibson EB-2

The Gibson EB-2 was an electric bass guitar model produced by the Gibson Guitar Corporation from 1958 to 1972, with a hiatus from 1962 to 1963. When production ceased in 1972, a total of 8017 instruments has been built, with 2102 of them being EB-2D's. Willie Moseley, in "Vintage Guitar", referred to the bass guitar as possibly "Gibson's biggest bass invention"; the instrument, however, was not a great commercial success, and the Rivoli, the sister model made by Epiphone, may have been used more than the original Gibson.
Description.
Introduced in 1958, the EB-2 was the bass guitar equivalent of the popular Gibson ES-335. It featured a 335-style semi-hollow body, a short 30.5" scale neck and one large "Sidewinder" humbucking pickup in the neck position. The electronics consisted of a single volume and tone knob. The EB-2N had natural finish, the EB-2 sunburst. The next year a "Baritone switch" was added, which enhanced or cut the bass frequencies, and later a string mute was added to the bridge. By 1961 the original banjo-style tuners (with the pegs pointing backwards) were replaced by regular tuners, and by 1965 cherry was a color option also.
In 1966, the EB-2D was introduced, which added a mini-humbucker pickup in the bridge position (like the EB-3). Electronics included separate volume and tone controls and a 3-way switch to select the pickups, besides the "baritone" switch.
Variants.
In 2012 Gibson came out with a "Midtown Standard" bass, a semi-hollow bass loosely based on the EB-2D. Although cosmetically very alike, it supports a short-scale 34" neck, a solid mahogany body with routed tonechambers and a flat maple top, which is considerably smaller than the original 335-shape (somewhere between an ES-335 and a Les Paul shape) and different electronics.

Kim Nam-joo

Kim Nam-joo (born May 10, 1971) is a South Korean actress. Kim rose to stardom in the 1990s in television series such as "Model", "The Boss" and "Her House". After 2001, Kim went into semi-retirement, only appearing in commercials, particularly after she got married to actor Kim Seung-woo in 2005 and they started a family. Then in 2009, she made her comeback with "Queen of Housewives", written by Park Ji-eun. "Housewives" was a ratings hit, and Kim went on to collaborate with Park on "Queen of Reversals" (2010), and "My Husband Got a Family" (the number one top-rated program on Korean television for the entire year of 2012), and the series' success established Kim's continuing star status.
Early life.
Kim Nam-joo was born in Seoul, South Korea. When she was two years old, her father's business failed, which resulted in the family moving to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where Kim spent her childhood and adolescence. After graduating from high school, she enrolled as a Dance major at Suwon Women's College. When she was a sophomore, Kim joined the Miss Korea pageant, and the experience led her to quit school to pursue modeling in September 1992.
Career.
Kim won 4th place in a talent search by broadcaster SBS in 1994, and quickly became a popular television star in her twenties. Her characters in the hit TV series "City Men and Women" (1996), "Model" (1997), "The Boss" (1999) and "Her House" (2001), made her the epitome of a sophisticated, urban career woman in 1990s Korea. But after "Her House", Kim went into semi-retirement, only appearing in lucrative commercials, mostly for cosmetics and luxury goods. She married actor Kim Seung-woo in 2005, and for several years she lived as a full-time housewife and mother.
In 2007, she stretched some acting muscle opposite Sol Kyung-gu in "Voice of a Murderer", about the tormenting and ultimately unsuccessful attempts of two parents to bring their kidnapped child back home. Based on the true story of a kidnapped child found dead in 1991, the film faithfully follows the 44-day quest to find the missing victim.
Kim made a successful television comeback in "Queen of Housewives" (also known as "My Wife is a Superwoman") in 2009. A comedy drama that depicts the life of housewives who devote their entire lives to their husbands' success, it became one of the most-watched shows during its run, topping Korea's TV ratings charts for three consecutive weeks. It also created new trends among married women in terms of confidence, fashion and makeup. Kim's character Chun Ji-ae was once the most popular girl in high school, and she's determined to help her smart but clueless husband climb the corporate ladder once she realizes that he is an underperformer at work. Chun meets her match, however, when she discovers that his boss is the husband of her high school frenemy. Her portrayal of a modern Korean housewife won Kim numerous accolades.
Kim reunited with "Queen of Housewives" writer Park Ji-eun in another workplace romantic dramedy, 2010's "Queen of Reversals". This time Kim played a strong and decisive career woman trying to balance work and married life. Her character Hwang Tae-hee experiences the many ups, downs, and reversals of work, family, and romance as she falls in and out of love and marriage. Ratings-wise "Queen of Reversals" was less successful than its predecessor, though Kim was awarded the highest award (Daesang or "Grand Prize") at MBC's year-end drama awards ceremony.
She also released her book that year, called "Kim Nam-joo's House". The collection of essays and photographs is a candid discussion of her family life and home.
Kim then led the 2012 weekend family drama "My Husband Got a Family" (also known as "You Who Rolled in Unexpectedly" and "Unexpected You"), which took a comedic and serious approach to the trials and tribulations of a TV director dealing with her in-laws when her husband reunites with his biological parents. Kim and Park's third collaboration was a big hit with audiences, it was number one on the 2012 yearly TV ratings chart with average ratings of 33.1 percent and a ratings peak of 52.3 percent, and Kim won another Daesang at the KBS Drama Awards.
The popularity of TV dramas that portray the lives of working women in their 30s and 40s represents a larger trend in Korean culture, mainly a reflection of women marrying at a later age and working more in their 20s. Kim is now considered one of the few established Korean actresses in their 30s, 40s and even 50s who have held on to the spotlight, reversing an ageist trend that dictated casting for decades.

<doc id="36549398" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36549398" title="William de Karlell">
William de Karlell

William de Karlell (died 1383) was an English-born judge, administrator and cleric in fourteenth-century Ireland. He held numerous benefices including Archdeacon of Meath and Rector of Youghal, and sat in the Irish House of Commons. After many years as a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) he was briefly Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. He is buried in St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny.
Background.
He took his name from his birthplace, Carlisle, Cumbria. John de Karlell (died 1393), Chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, was his brother; John also in time became a Baron of the Exchequer. They were of fairly humble origin, as suggested by the later comment that William was not a fit person to arrest one of the Wellesley family.
Career.
He came to Ireland as part of the entourage of Lionel of Antwerp, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1361 and was made Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1367. He became a prebendary of St Patrick's Cathedral the same year and later acquired numerous other prebendaries, including Ossory. His main residence was in Kilkenny; he was a burgess of the town and died there. In 1374 he and his brother John were summoned to the Parliament of Ireland in Dublin as two of the King's counsel. In 1383 the King appointed him Queen's Attorney; soon after he was made Chief Baron but died within a few months.
Duties.
Graves remarks that since the Catholic Church was the only source of highly educated men, some like the Karlell brothers were civil servants rather than clerics. William's duties went far beyond the strictly judicial : he audited accounts, supervised sheriffs elections, inquired into the condition of Crown lands, and into the existence of buried treasure. His duties involved much labour and expense, and in 1374 he received £20 for, among other expenses, the theft of his horse.
Character.
From the limited evidence he seems to have been a proud man with a keen sense of his own dignity : in 1372 Sir William Wellesley, ancestor of the 1st Duke of Wellington, was arrested for disobeying a summons to appear before Karlell, and the following year one Richard Bateman was found guilty of contempt of court for saying that Karlell was not fit to arrest one of Wellesley's rank, presumably due to his lower social standing.
Tomb.
Graves describes his tomb as a coffin-shaped slab, six feet by two, elevated about two feet from the floor of the cathedral, and completely unadorned except for an inscription giving William's name and clerical offices. His brother John was also buried in St Canice's but his tomb was largely destroyed in the seventeenth century.

The Churchills (TV series)

The Churchills is a 2012 documentary in three parts written and presented by David Starkey tells the story of two great war leaders Winston Churchill and his ancestor John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and the striking similarities in their lives.
Starkey argues throughout that it was Winston's absorption in the 17th century that helped him to be the first to recognise the menace of a new European hegemony, warning Parliament about the Nazis before Hitler had even come to power.
Episode one: The Choice.
The first programme in the series tells how Winston Churchill came to write "", his four volume biography of his ancestor John Churchill written over ten years when he was in the political wilderness as a back bench MP between 1929 and 1938.
The first volume and this episode describes how John Churchill rose from obscurity to be the right-hand man of King James II when his sister Arabella became mistress to James. Religious difference between Catholic France and Protestant Holland and the tensions in England with a catholic King and a Protestant parliament John Churchill chose political principles over personal loyalty and betrayed James and joined William and Mary in the Glorious Revolution that set Britain on the course to democracy, and committed her to war with Louis XIV's France.
Episode two: The March to War.
Volume two of his book on Marlborough concentrates on events following the Treaty of Ryswick and the pacifism sweeping Britain just as it was in 1930's Britain following the Treaty of Versailles with no wish to fight more wars. Winston Churchill had visited Munich in 1932 and saw the rise of the Nazi Germany leading to a new war. William of Orange died and Queen Anne came to power and Marlborough previously sidelined, as was Winston Churchill, came to the fore to fight the French and its expansionist ideas culminating in the Battle of Blenheim. Volume two was published in October 1934 and a copy presented to Stanley Baldwin, Prime Minister of a coalition government.
Episode three: Grand Strategies.
Volume three of his book on Marlborough highlighted the Battle of Ramillies when Marlborough's use of concentrated cavalry routed the French army and destroyed the morale of the French nation. The tactics of concentrated German tanks on the same battlefield of Belgium in the second world war had the same effect leading Winston Churchill to abandon France. Needing his own Grand Alliance to defeat Hitler Churchill cultivated his friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt and when America entered the war it was Chuchills stratergy that prevailed over American generals who wanted to open a front in Northern France as early as 1942. Churchill recognized from his experiences as soldier that German forces were too strong in France and had to be weakened by supplying the Russians fighting on the eastern front, bombing German industry and attacking German forces in Africa and Italy. This strategy led to a weakening of German troops in Normandy and led to the success of D Day in 1944.

GE Dash 8 Series

The Dash 8 Series is a line of diesel-electric freight locomotives built by GE Transportation Systems. It replaced the Dash 7 Series in the mid-1980s, and was superseded by the Dash 9 Series in the mid-1990s.
All models of the Dash 8 Series are powered by a 16- or 12-cylinder, turbocharged, GE 7FDL 4-stroke diesel engine.
Specifications.
The design of the Dash 8 Series is based upon that of the Dash 7 Series. The biggest changes introduced during the production of the Dash 8 Series were the first use of a microprocessor-equipped engine control unit in a diesel locomotive, and the adoption of a modular system in the construction of the vehicle body.
The Dash 8 locomotive bodies were assembled from several modules, creating a combination to fit the length of the chassis. On models with a traditional narrow short hood, the part of the equipment room immediately behind the cab is taller than the top of the rounded cab roof, giving those models a distinctive appearance. On all models, that part of the equipment room houses the cooling fans for the dynamic braking system.
Traction motors of Dash 8 locomotives were powered by direct current.
Construction history.
The Dash 8 prototype was completed in 1984. Manufacture of the improved production units started in earnest in 1987. Early versions of the Dash 8 were manufactured on the Dash 7 production line, but their general appearance was different. The Dash 8-40C, introduced in 1987, featured improved reliability.
Nomenclature.
The naming of the Dash 8 Series, and that of its various models, corresponded initially with that of its predecessor, the Dash 7. So, for example, "B32-8" designated a B-B configured Dash 8 Series locomotive.
After product improvements were made to the line in 1987, the official designations for models in this series changed to "Dash 8...", as shown below. However, for simplicity many railroads decided to use designations which follow the pattern of the Dash 7 line. For example, the Dash 8-40C is usually rendered as "C40-8".
The "W" suffix used for some models indicates the then-optional wide-nose "North American" safety cab.
Four axle models.
Common features.
Specifications common to all Dash 8 Series four axle models are as follows:
Dash 8-32B (B32-8).
This model was manufactured between 1984 and 1989.
Forty nine examples of the model were built for North American railroads.
All but four of these units were ordered by Norfolk Southern.
The others were three units ordered by Burlington Northern Railroad, and a GE demonstrator unit.
Dash 8-36B (B36-8).
This model, a one-off, was the original Dash 8 prototype, built in 1983.
Dash 8-39B (B39-8).
A total of 145 examples of this model were manufactured from 1984. Its external appearance is almost the same as that of the later Dash 8-40B model, with the obvious exception of the trucks.
The first three Dash 8-39Bs were built for Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF). A fourth example of the model, a GE demonstrator designated as a Dash 8-39BE (or B39-8E), was converted from the original Dash 8 prototype.
There were also two much larger groups of this model: 145 Dash 8-39BEs were fabricated for Locomotive Management Services (LMSX) and placed on long term lease to Burlington Northern Railroad.
The remaining 40 were built for the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Dash 8-40B (B40-8).
In 1988 and 1989, a total of 150 units of this model were produced.
Substantial orders for the model came from ATSF (40 units), Conrail (30 units), New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (24 units), and the model's biggest customer, St. Louis Southwestern Railway (54 units).
There were also small orders from Providence and Worcester Railroad (4 units), the United States Department of Energy (Savannah River Site), and a GE demonstrator unit.
Dash 8-40BW (B40-8W).
Eighty three examples of this model were built for ATSF in the early 1990s. ATSF was the only railroad to order it. There was also one GE prototype and testbed, rebuilt from the prototype B39-8E.
The "W" suffix to this model's name indicates that it differs from the B40-8 in having a "wide nose" safety cab.
GE was almost commissioned by ATSF to make a B unit (cabless booster unit) version of this model, but because the price would have been the same for B40-8Ws with cabs or without, ATSF decided to order units with cabs only.
All of ATSF's B40-8Ws became part of BNSF, and many were later reliveried into one of BNSF's liveries.
Some have since been sold to other operators.
Six axle models.
Common features.
Specifications common to all Dash 8 Series six axle models, except where stated, are as follows:
Dash 8-32C (C32-8).
This was one of the earliest models in the Dash 8 Series. Only 10 of the model were built, in 1984. All of them were delivered to Conrail.
Initially, these units were painted in Conrail's standard blue livery. In 1997, Conrail assigned all 10 of them to "Ballast Express" service, and they were repainted into a gray version of the Quality scheme.
One C32-8 was eventually bought by Brasil Ferrovias (BF), after being retired by Conrail. However, this unit developed problems with its electronics, and was therefore decommissioned to supply parts for the mechanically similar C30-7As operated on the Cutralle–Quintela railroad.
Dash 8-39C (C39-8).
Between 1984 and 198, a total of 161 examples of this model were produced for two North American railroads: Norfolk Southern and Conrail.
An initial batch of 114 of the standard version of this model was built for Norfolk Southern, which then ordered a batch of 25 examples of the C39-8E (Enhanced) model, with a carbody similar to that of the C40-8.
Conrail ordered 22 of the standard version. After the Conrail split in 1999, 13 units of this order went to Norfolk Southern and the remaining 9 units went to CSX.
Dash 8-40C (C40-8).
This was the first model of any locomotive series to be fitted with microprocessor-equipped engine control units. A total of 581 examples of the model were manufactured between 1987 and 1992.
The C40-8 has a traditional narrow short hood, but otherwise its external appearance is almost the same as that of the later Dash 8-40CW model.
The most important customer for this model was UP, which ordered 257 of them.
Other large orders for the model came from Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (77 units), Canadian National (53), Conrail (25), CSX (147) and Norfolk Southern (75).
The remaining four units were supplied to Estrada de Ferro Carajás of Brazil.
Dash 8-40CM (C40-8M).
Mechanically identical to the Dash 8-40C (see above) and Dash 8-40CW (see below), this model was constructed between 1990 and 1994 only for Canadian railways, with a production total of 84 units.
The model is distinguished from the Dash 8-40CW by the addition of a full-width cowl body and the use of a Canada-specific nose and windshield configuration.
BC Rail ordered 26 examples of the model, Canadian National ordered 55, and Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway acquired the remaining three.
Dash 8-40CW (C40-8W).
Early versions of this model differ from the Dash 8-40C only in having a "wide" or "safety" cab. A total of 756 examples of the model were built, with the first being delivered to Union Pacific in 1990.
The C40-8W was continuously upgraded over the course of its production. Later model Conrail units were built with split cooling systems for the turbocharger intercooler and engine cooling (previous Dash 8 series had both on the same cooling system).
The units delivered to Conrail in 1993 and 1994 were equipped with GE's Integrated Function Displays (IFD).
Some of the C40-8Ws operated by Conrail were lease units owned by LMSX. The other railroads that operated C40-8Ws as original owners were ATSF and CSX.
Dash 8-41CW (C41-8W).
This model is a variation of the C40-8W with the same 16-cylinder engine upgraded to .
A total of 154 C41-8Ws were produced between 1993 and 1994 for both UP and ATSF.
Some Dash 8-40CW units were similarly uprated to Dash 8-41CW standard by the railroads.
Dash 8-44CW (C44-8W).
A total of 53 examples of this model were built in 1993–1994, all of them for CSX. Were then upgraded with Dash 9 electronics.

Music Online Records

Music Online Records is one of the oldest and biggest music portals in Brazil. It has been online since April 18, 1998. The headquarters is in Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil, at the São Francisco neighborhood.
The portal started as a hobby of the web developer Andre Luis de Andrade, and his interest was to work with the music in all forms, helping artists to display their music. It is one of the first projects around the world to have focus in music working for free (it is even older than MySpace).
The Beginning.
In the beginning, the site was developed in pure HTML, hosted in free servers like Geocities, Tripod.com and Xoom (web hosting). Since year 2000, when the site bought the domain www.musiconline.com.br and started the new automated services, it has been offering for free the opportunity to bands, artists and composers sign in the VIP AREA to register his/her job. The systems was developed (and continue at this way) using PHP and MySQL.
Between 2000 and 2006, the Music Online Records got a good place in Brazilian internet with excellent classification at iBest Award, the biggest award in Brazilian internet. In 2001, 2002 and 2006, the portal got the TOP3, in 2002, 2003 and 2004 got the TOP5 and in 2000 and 2005 got the TOP10. In all these years, the site competes against big projects in Brazil, like MTV Brasil and the singers Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil. Since this time, some versions can be viewed at the Way Back Machine [http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://www.musiconline.xpg.com.br.
The Expansion.
In 2006, the project improved the offer of music content, creating more VIP Services and increasing the database with Artists, Lyrics, Chords, Music Radios, Music Videos, Artists Pictures and a lot of contents in this way.
Until 2011, the website was walking alone, with no big partnerships helping to maintain the dream of its project. In that year, the portal started a partnership with XPG, a free site and blog creation portal, but they have special partnerships, like Music Online Records. In the same time the goal of 100,000 users registered was achieved and the URL changed to www.musiconline.xpg.com.br (but, maintain the domain informed below).
Nowadays.
Nowadays, the Music Online Records portal has a respected place in their niche, improving the visits for 1.5 million unique visitors per month (50 thousand per day) and is working a lot to improve the quantity of followers on pages in the social networking sites (Facebook, Orkut, Linked In and Twitter). The content was increased too and compounded for 10 another websites (Grátis Música, Ouvir Músicas Grátis and others), and some of them provide part of the content of the portal (include Online Games channel).
As of September 27, 2012, the portal contains: 110,000 artists, 110,000 users registered, 1,7 million lyrics, 189 thousand chords, 5,000 playlist radios, 60,000 artists pictures, 3,000 garage bands and a complete channels with shows, music news. It’s included a million of musics to be listened online and online music videos from YouTube API and other partners.
The planning for next years are continue increasing the content and discussing more about music to improve the quality of the songs. Another ideas, includes real world projects to helping people to developing yourselves.

Flora Garry

Flora Garry (30 September 1900 - 16 June 2000) was a Scottish poet who mostly wrote in the Scots dialect of Aberdeenshire.
Well known for her poetry, she played an important role along with Charles Murray and John C. Milne in validating the literary use of Scots.
Biography.
Flora Garry was the daughter of Archie Campbell, a freelance writer who used the "nom de plume" of "The Buchan Farmer", and Helen Campbell, who wrote plays for radio.
She was brought up at Mains of Auchmunziel, near to New Deer, Buchan in Abderdeenshire.
She went to school in New Deer, then went on to the Peterhead Academy and the University of Aberdeen.
She became a school teacher, and taught at Dumfries and Strichen.
She married Robert C. Garry, who was the first to use insulin in Scotland while a house doctor at Western Infirmary, Glasgow and who became Regius Professor of Physiology at the University of Glasgow. They had one son, Frank.
Flora Garry did not start to write poetry until World War II, and did not publish anything until she was an old age pensioner.
Explaining why she began writing poetry so late, she said that just as happiness has no history, neither does it write poetry.
She corresponded with Edith Anne Robertson (1883–1973), another Aberdeenshire poet who wrote in the Scots tongue.
Her verse collection "Bennygoak" was first published in 1974.
She spent her last years in Comrie, Perthshire, dying there on 16 June 2000 after outliving her husband and her son.
Work.
Flora Garry loved the gently rolling farming country of Buchan, which she celebrating in her poetry.
Although she wrote fine English, her full talent emerged in her work in the local Buchan dialect.
Most of the writers in Scots in the first half of the twentieth century were well educated and of middle-class background. They respected the Scots language but it was not their native tongue. Flora Garry was unusual in that as a child she probably spoke the language she later used in her poetry.
A reviewer has said that her Doric poetry is written "with a sure touch and a sharp eye."
Another has said she was "one of the most uncompromising of recent dialect poets; but the great affection in which she and her work are locally held is clear evidence not only for the vitality of her Doric as a poetic medium but for the strength of the folk-memory of traditional NE farming life."

Roque Centurión Miranda

Roque Centurión Miranda (August 15, 1900 in Carapeguá-January 31, 1960 in Asunción) was a Paraguayan playwright, theater director and stage, radio and film actor. Enriched by a creative and enthusiastic group of young actors and playwrights including Luis Ruffinelli, Miguel Pecci Saavedra, Francisco Martín Barrios, Facundo Recalde, Benigno Villa and Arturo Alsina, Centurión Miranda is remembered as one of the true creators of the Paraguayan theatre. He began working as an actor. In 1926 he wrote his first play, "Cupido sudando", a comedy in three acts, earning him critical acclaim after it was performed. Later, in 1932, in collaboration with Josefina Pla he wrote "Episodios chaqueños". His 1933 Guaraní language drama "Tuyú" in three acts which dealt with young Chaco blood spilled by Paraguayan soldiers was a major success and is considered by critics to be the cornerstone of the Guaraní theatre.
Alternating the roles of actor and author, in 1942 he was working again with Josefina Pla, writing several works together such as "La hora de Caín", "María Inmaculada", "Aquí no ha pasado nada", "Un sobre en blanco o Paréntesis", "La huella", "Pater familias" and "Porasy". These continued to earn the respect of critics and the public.
In 1950 he founded the Municipal School of Performing Arts (Escuela Municipal de Arte Escénico). Centurión Miranda also appeared in three major film productions alongside Argentine movie stars. He starred in films such as "Codicia" (1955), "El trueno entre las hojas" (1958) and "La sangre y la semilla" (1959). "La sangre y la semilla" was directed by Alberto Du Bois, co-starring Olga Zubarry and Ernesto Báez. Centurión Miranda died in Asunción on January 31, 1960. Currently, the municipal theatrical school which he founded is named after him in his honor.

The Teng Chun

The Teng Chun (; 18 June 1902 – 25 February 1977), also known by his Indonesian name Tahyar Idris, was a Chinese Indonesian film producer. Born to a rich businessman, The became interested in film while still a youth. After a period as an exporter, in 1930 he established Cino Motion Picture to produce films in the Dutch East Indies. In a little over a decade he and his company had released at least 31 films, including some of the country's first talkies. Although he experienced a brief resurgence during the 1950s, after Indonesia became independent, he spent the last years of his life as an English teacher.
Biography.
The was born in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (modern day Jakarta, Indonesia) on 18 June 1902 to a rich businessman name The Kim Ie. As a child he studied at a Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan school.
The studied economics in the United States beginning in 1920. However, instead of following his father's footsteps The studied filmmaking at the Palmer Play Theater; one of his fellow film students was Fred Young, another "peranakan" Chinese from the Indies, who would collaborate with The. While in the US The worked towards convincing his father to become a film importer; the elder The initially refused, but eventually agreed to his son's proposal.
After five years of studies he went to Shanghai and became involved in the country's cinema industry, working on exporting films from China to the Indies and trying his hand at filmmaking. He returned to the Indies in 1930, after Shanghai-produced films became less popular. In the Indies, The – despite his father insisting that importing films was more profitable – established Cino Motion Pictures. The nation's cinema was still in its infancy; the first locally-produced feature film, "Loetoeng Kasaroeng", had been released in 1926, and there were only three other film production companies in the country.
The studio's first release, "Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang", was among the first talkies produced in the country, but a critical failure. The followed this with several further releases, including the commercial success "Sam Pek Eng Tay". From 1933 until early 1935, all feature films from the Dutch East Indies were produced by The, partly because of the Great Depression and partly because of the difficulties and financial burdens caused by transitioning from silent films to talkies. These stories were based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese.
In 1935 the company's name changed to Java Industrial Film (JIF) and The brought his siblings into the business, which became increasingly active. Teng Gan became general assistant, Teng Liong was put in charge of sound, and Teng Hwi was tasked as a cameraman. By 1938 JIF had begun focusing on stories dealing with modern issues, possibly in response to Albert Balink's 1938 film "Pareh".
Java Industrial Film closed during the Japanese occupation, starting in 1942. During the occupation The worked for a period in a theatrical group, but he found it unfulfilling and left soon afterwards. After Indonesia's independence and the cease of the National Revolution, he and Fred Young established the Bintang Soerabaja film company, which continued production until 1962. After the studio closed, The became an English teacher and, in 1967, changed his name to Tahyar Idris.
The died on 25 February 1977 in Jakarta. He received an award from the capital's governor shortly before his death.
Filmography.
During his career The released at least 34 films, as follows:

Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Menshikov

Prince Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Menshikov (1 March 1714 – 27 November 1764) was a son of Prince Menshikov who, at one stage, was betrothed to Grand Duchess Natalya Alexeyevna, a granddaughter of Peter the Great. He later served as an officer in the Russian army.
Life.
Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Menshikov was the son of Prince Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov and his wife Darya Mikhailovna.
With the accession of Catherine, the second wife of Peter the Great, to the Russian throne in 1725, Prince Menshikov was practically the absolute ruler of Russia. Prince Menshikov arranged the betrothal of his elder daughter Princess Maria to the future Tsar Peter II. Prince Menshikov similarly arranged the betrothal of his son to Grand Duchess Natalya Alexeyevna, a granddaughter of Peter the Great. However, following the fall and exile of the Menshikovs in September 1727, the engagement was broken off and the family was stripped of all their positions and property titles and charged with embezzlement and abuse. The family was exiled to the Siberian town of Beryozovo.
After the death of their father in 1729, Aleksandr and his surviving sister, Alexandra, (his sister Maria had died of smallpox while they were in exile) were able to return from exile in 1731 during the reign of Empress Anna Ivanovna. Only part of their personal property was returned such as clothing, linens and tableware including copper and tin. However, the Menshikov jewels were retained by the Empress. The jewels of the family were later used for the crown for the coronation of the Emperor, including diamonds, pearls and emeralds.
In 1731, Aleksandr Menshikov became an ensign in the Guards Preobrazhensky Regiment. He participated in the capture of Ochakov (1737) and Khotin (1739), under the leadership of Count Munnich, and in 1738 became a captain-lieutenant.

Kampala Tower

Kampala Tower, sometimes referred to as the East African Trade Centre, is a proposed building in Kampala, the capital of Uganda and the largest city in that country.
Location.
The skyscraper will be located on Kira Road, in the Kampala neighborhood known as Kamwookya, approximately , by road, northeast of the central business district of Kampala (pop.1,720,000). The coordinates of Kampala Tower are:0° 20' 6.00"N, 32° 34' 57.00"E (Latitude:0.3350; Longitude:32.5825).
Overview.
Kampala Tower will sit on a site that currently houses the "Uganda National Museum" and the headquarters of Uganda Wildlife Authority, both of which will be relocated. Other nearby structures, including "Kitante Primary School", may have to temporarily relocate while construction is going on. The tower will serve as the headquarters of the Ugandan Ministry of Tourism, Trade & Industry. In addition, the building will provide upsclale rentable office and retail space in this rapidily-expanding neighborhood of Uganda's capital city. When completed, in 2020 as expected, the tower will become the tallest building on the African continent, surpassing the Carlton Centre in Johannesburg, South Africa, which, at , is the reigning height leader. Kampala Tower will contain over , of office and retail space, enough to accommodate up to 12,500 people.
History.
The lead planning institution is the development of this project is the Uganda Ministry of Tourism, Trade & Industry. Working with those original cencepts, the London-based architectural firm Capita Symonds, assisted by the Ugandan firm Plan Systems Limited, drew several architectural designs for the Ugandan government to select from. In 2010, the architects presented their final drawings to the Ugandan Government for final approval.
Construction costs.
, the estimated construction costs were US$750 million (UGX:1.83 trillion). This estimate is likely to go up, due to increased costs of building materials since that time. Government is currently sourcing for a private investor, who will fund the construction, own and operate the building for 30 years following commissioning. It is anticipated that by that time, the investor would have recouped his/her investment with reasonable profit. The building would revert to the Ugandan government following the thirty year period. Construction was originally planned to start in 2011 and last 6 to 8 years. , the development is on hold, while a private investor is sought.
Controversy.
The development of Kampala Tower has been strongly opposed by a wide section of society. Currently, there is a civil lawsuit winding its way through the Ugandan court system, that was filed by a consortium of civil society organisations that are opposed to the project.

Gretel Beer (Vienna, 11 July 1921–11 August 2010, Deal, Kent) was an Austrian-born English author of cooking books and travel reports. She also served as the Women's Page Editor for "The Daily Telegraph". 
Baer was born into a Jewish family as Margaret Weidenfeld. She was mostly raised by her aunt Olga Springer (Bechin, Bohemia 1879–1942 Maly Trostenets extermination camp) the widow of a physician (in 1937: 9th district, Porzellangasse 45), as her mother Regina Pisk died when Margaret was five years old and her father, Duny Weidenfeld, did not keep up a household. (At Porzellangasse, until 1938 Eric Pleskow and Ari Rath as well spent their childhood, as they told the Austrian broadcaster ORF in 2012.) After attending primary school at Marchegg, a small town east of Vienna near the border with Slovakia, she attended a federal "Realschule" at Vereinsgasse in Vienna's 2nd district, where many Jewish Viennese lived.
In the spring of 1938, after the annexation of Austria by Germany, she and 48 other pupils were forced to leave this school and attend a Jewish class somewhere else in Vienna. At the entrance hall of her school, which is now called "Bundesrealgymnasium Vereinsgasse", since 1989 the names of the expelled pupils are displayed on a memorial inscription.
Her father managed to emigrate to England and arranged for her to leave the "Third Reich" with a Kindertransport arranged by British NGOs. In March 1939 she arrived in Harwich and worked in several professions in England. In 1943 she married Dr Johann Beer, former Viennese lawyer (in 1937: "Rechtsanwalt", 9th district, Porzellangasse 8), who was later able to work as British lawyer. They later lived in an apartment at Gray's Inn in London and in a manor house in Deal, Kent. 
She worked in advertising and public relations, and after the war she was successful with her cookery books and her journalistic work, e.g. for the "Daily Telegraph" and "Vogue". She travelled to Austria at least once a year and kept the typical Viennese German useful to describe the secrets of Viennese cuisine. Her husband died in 1981 in their manor house, during a fire which he could not escape in his wheelchair.

Road-effect zone

The Road-effect zone is the area in which effects on the natural environment extend outward from a road. Such effects are substance emissions like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds, biological matter, rubber, or salt, intangible emissions like noise or light, and changes of the micro climate like alterations of wind, water flows, temperature or moisture.
Range.
Also in science, there is ongoing debate on the width of the road-effect zone, sometimes also called buffer area. Most studies conform to an extension that can range from as little as 20 meters to a width up to two or more kilometers. Jordaan et al. find an area of 100 meters significantly impacted, Biglin & Dupigny-Giroux estimate 71.25% of the total impact to lie within the first 300 meters, Deblinger & Forman suggest an average area of 600 meters to be concerned, and Eigenbrod et al. found a considerably negative effect on differing anuran species for areas of 250 to 1.000 meters.
Species affected.
Determining the size of the road-effect zone is additionally complicated by varying local spatial patterns and the result significantly depends on the particular species under investigation; for instance there are large differences between moose, mice, plants, bats or anurans, and even among anuran species themselves.
Challenges.
The road-effect zone is a topic that, due to drastically increased mobility-intensive lifestyles, and due to the cognition of their adverse effects on the non-human environment or biological diversity in total, has gained augmented interest in the recent past. Its impact on, and integration in to, spatial planning are challenges to be dealt with today and tomorrow to a greater degree.

<doc id="36550047" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36550047" title="Isla Falta Calzado">
Isla Falta Calzado

Isla Falta Calzado is a Panamanian island with an area of located in the middle of the Panama Canal in the southwest region of the Gatun Lake. The Island was created when the waters of the Chagres River were dammed by the Gatun Dam to create the Gatun lake. When the waters rose, they covered a significant part of the existing rainforest, and the hilltops became the islands that are now scattered throughout the lake.
History.
There are few references as to how the island got its name, literally translated as Island of the Missing Footwear, but more commonly translated as Island of the Missing Shoe. It is believed to have originated from a wedding tradition of the indigenous people.
Because of the currents created in the lake, the locals observed that things thrown into the water on one side of the island often washed ashore on the other side of the island. This led to a tradition of the wedding party throwing one of their footwear, usually some sort of sandal, into the water a week before the wedding. It was believed that if both shoes washed ashore then the wedding was destined for lifelong bliss, if only one shoe washed ashore then the partner with the missing shoe would be destined for a life of misery in the marriage and if neither washed ashore, the marriage was destined for doom.
It is unknown how many marriages were formed or ended due to this tradition, but it led to an influx of soon to be newlyweds, from other islands, making the trek to Isla Falta Calzado to test their compatibility with their soon to be mate.
Nature Sanctuary.
The Falta Calzado Sanctuary was created, in 1980, with the aim of preserving the Gallademia woodpecker that inhabits the island. It wasn't until the late 20th century that conservationalist realized the extent of the damage to the Gallademia woodpecker population due to poaching and Avian Botulism
The indigenous population and poachers hunted the birds, to near extinction, because of its bright and plush plumage. The Panamanian government placed a restriction on the hunting and capture of the bird to promote its survival in the wild. Thanks to the efforts of the Panamanian government and the University of Panama conservation programs, the once endangered bird is now flourishing on the island and the surrounding islands.
Population.
Until recently, the only inhabitants were the curators of the small research center and marina, but the structures were destroyed in 1998 by Hurricane Mitch, leaving the island uninhabited. The only visitors are occasional fishermen and marine biologists. A small building was built on the island, by the University of Panama, to act as a temporary outpost for the biologist. The Energy crisis in Panama led to the University of Panama to use the cabin as an example of sustainable technologies at work in the real world. The Sciences and Technology department at the University with research grants from the Panamanian Government, routinely test new solar power generation and water purification techniques on the cabin, and are credited with making major advancements in that area of study.
Wildlife.
The island is locally known for the endemic Gallademia woodpecker, a widespread and easily seen bird species on the island. The lizard "Isthmian Alligator Lizard" was known to inhabit the island but has not been seen in the late 20th century.
The surrounding waters are feeding areas for White-lipped mud turtles. The island was inhabited by a now-extinct golden toad, "Bufo periglenes".
Falta Calzado also supports nationally important numbers of the following birds.

<doc id="36550176" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36550176" title="Vanishing foam">
Vanishing foam

Vanishing foam is a substance applied to an athletic field in order to provide a temporary visual marker for use by both players and referees for the purposes of ensuring fair play. It is used primarily by association football referees to indicate the minimum distance that members of the opposing team must remain from the ball during a free kick, as well as the spot from which the kick is taken. Used mainly at the highest levels of competition, vanishing foam is said to help prevent unnecessary delays by preventing the defensive team from encroaching closer than the mandated from the ball during a free kick, and also by preventing the attacking team from illegally moving the ball from the spot where the referee awarded the kick. Critics, however, argue that its use is the result of referees' lax enforcement of rules already set forth in the Laws of the Game. Its use is not regulated by the Laws of the Game, but by the local governing body of an individual match, league, or tournament.
Overview.
Vanishing foam is applied from an aerosol can carried by the referee in a holster secured to their shorts. The referee has full discretion on whether or not to use vanishing spray, and opponents are required to retreat 10 yards from the spot of a free kick regardless of whether vanishing spray is used (unless the team awarded the kick elects to take a "quick" free kick with opponents still within 10 yards). It is generally only used when a free kick is awarded where a goal-scoring attempt is highly likely to develop, e.g., it is usually not used when a team is awarded a free kick in its own half of the pitch. When the referee chooses to use vanishing spray, he or she will usually mark the spot of the ball, then pace 10 yards in the direction of the attack, then spray a line marking that distance. Finally, the referee will indicate for the free kick to be taken, usually by blowing the whistle. The marks disappear after about one minute.
Technical details.
The can contains water (~80%), butane gas (~17%), surfactant (~1%), and other ingredients (~2%). The butane expands when the pressure changes, forming small drops of butane, covered with water, on the ground. Eventually the butane evaporates, leaving only water and surfactant residue on the ground. The US patent application can be viewed here.
History.
In the 1980s the first version was developed by a company consisting, amongst others, of Sir Bobby Charlton and FA referee, Neil Midgely. The English FA rejected the idea, failing even to attend field trials. Approaches to Adidas's English office to develop the product were rejected. The first use in a professional level was in the 2000 Brazilian Championship, Copa João Havelange. A successful commercial version was invented in 2002 by Argentinian entrepreneur Pablo Silva and called it "9-15". The spray has been patented by Brazilian inventor Heine Allemagne since October 29, 2002 although it is not the version FIFA uses. Since then, the spray has been used in many international football competitions. In June 2014 the spray's latest commercial version, "9-15", made its debut in the FIFA 2014 World Cup.
The 2011 Copa América tournament was the first tournament for national teams to use the spray. Its success caused it to be adopted by several national leagues in 2011 in the America's including the North American MLS association. It has also been used in the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey, the 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Championship in Malta and Gozo, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.
The first World Cup match to feature the vanishing spray was the opening game of the 2014 FIFA World Cup between Brazil and Croatia on 12 June, used by referee Yuichi Nishimura.

National Pony Express Association

National Pony Express Association (NPEA) is a non-profit, volunteer-led historical organization. Its purpose is to preserve the original Pony Express trail and to continue the memory and importance of Pony Express in American history in partnership with the National Park Service, Pony Express Trail Association, and the Oregon-California Trails Association.
History and organization.
The first re-ride of the Pony Express was held in 1923. 60 participants rode across the eight states that had originally made up the Pony Express trail: California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri.,
In April through October 1935, a Pony Express re-ride was held to commemorate the Pony Express' Diamond Jubilee. This date coincided the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Boy Scouts of America and 300 Boy Scouts were participants. Pieces of mail carried by the riders were delivered to President Franklin D. Roosevelt during a ceremony held on the White House lawn.
The National Pony Express Centennial Association was created in 1960 and worked with committees within each of the trail states to organize and conduct a 100th anniversary re-ride. This event attracted state and national attention with included the participation of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the issuing of a commemorative coin by the United States Department of Treasury and the United States Postal Service.,
In 1966, National Pony Express Association (NPEA) was organized and received official corporate on March 3, 1978. Its national headquarters is located in Pollock Pines, California.
Annual re-ride.
Since 1980, the National Pony Express Association had held a re-ride every year in June. NPEA members ride across the 1,966 mile route non-stop over 10 days. Beginning in St. Joseph, Missouri and ending in Sacramento, California (alternating beginning and end destinations yearly), riders carry commemorative mail in mochillas. Each rider covers one to ten miles and must be able to change horses and/or mochillas in less than 15 minutes.
The Slide Ride of 1983.
Postal services were delayed following an avalanche that shut down U.S. Highway 50 between Whitehall and Kyburz, California on April 9, 1983. A contract was drawn up between the U.S. Postal Service and the National Pony Express Association in which riders agreed to carry the mail to around the landslide for $2 a day. Riders from the California and Nevada NPEA divisions carried 60,000 pieces of mail (including tax returns) over six weeks.
1996 Olympic Torch Relay.
On May 13–16, 1996, 325 National Pony Express Association riders from all eight state divisions carried the Olympic Torch during the Torch Relay for the 1996 Atlanta Olympic games. Each rider covered 1 to 2 miles across a 544-mile route from Julesburg, Colorado, to St. Joseph, Missouri.

Ogunquit Playhouse

The Ogunquit Playhouse is a regional theater in Ogunquit, Maine. The Ogunquit Playhouse is one of the last remaining summer theatres from the Straw Hat Circuit, also referred to as Summer Stock, still producing live musical theatre. The theatre is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
About.
The Ogunquit Playhouse produces five (sometimes more) musicals each season, with each season running mid-May through mid-October with performances Tuesday through Sunday. Each show is cast for its audience, and shows are produced and rehearsed onsite or in New York City.
Premieres.
On October 25, 2013, the Ogunquit Playhouse announced that it will stage one of the first regional premieres of Billy Elliot the Musical, and the American Northeast premiere of The Witches of Eastwick (musical). On January 14, 2014, it was announced that The Addams Family (musical) will be staged as one of the first regional premieres at the Playhouse.
Children's Theatre Program.
The Children's Theatre Program began in the late 1990s, offering children from ages 5–15 and opportunity to learn and perform on the Playhouse campus and stage.
Education and outreach.
With the expansion of the season from 10 to 21 weeks, the Playhouse was able to offer more educational opportunities to middle and high school children. In 2006, Fiddler on the Roof and Les Miserables (musical) sold out to enthusiastic young audiences. Corporate funding from Bank of America and a grant from The Davis Family Foundation enabled school performances and outreach programs to grow, bringing under-served children and families to the Playhouse to enjoy live theatre.
History.
Beginnings.
The Ogunquit Playhouse was established by Walter and Maude Hartwig in 1933 in a renovated garage in the center of Ogunquit, Maine. As part of the Little Theatre Movement of the 1920s and early 30s, Walter Hartwig organized an annual theatre tournament in New York. When the Depression put an end to the tournament, Hartwig started the Manhattan Theatre Colony and brought it to the town of Ogunquit. In 1937, the theatre moved to a new building at its present-day location on Main Street in Ogunquit, Maine. The Ogunquit Playhouse was the first, and remains the only, summer theatre from the summer stock era built exclusively as a seasonal theatre. After Walter's death in 1941, Maude carried on his legacy at the Playhouse.
1950s.
In 1950, John Lane became the general manager and eventually took ownership of the Playhouse with his business partner, Henry Weller. Together they focused on modernizing and improving the building and grounds, and through John Lane's direction, audiences enjoyed the brightest stars and finest professional actors performing in Broadway's best shows. After a long and successful career, John Lane retired in 1994. He transferred ownership to the Ogunquit Playhouse Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation that currently oversees the Ogunquit Playhouse. John Lane died in 2000.
1990s.
In September 1999, Roy M. Rogosin was hired as Producing Artistic Director to help usher the Playhouse towards a new era. During this transition, the playhouse began producing its own shows, designing and building sets, designing costumes and bringing back the stars. The old Manhattan Theatre Colony building was restored as a rehearsal space. At the same time, the Children's Theatre Program began, and continues today. The program provides a number of educational opportunities for children and teens interested in theatre, both as performers and behind-the-scenes.
2000s.
In 2006, Bradford Kenney came on board as the new Executive Artistic Director. With his guidance the Playhouse continued a tradition of excellence, bringing regional premieres and stars of the stage and screen to Ogunquit. With help from grants from the Maine Arts Commission and the Donato J. Tramuto Foundation, improvements were made to both the sound and lighting systems. Audiences were growing, and soon the theatre expanded from a 10-weeks to a 21-week season. In 2010, a new steel support system for the stage house section of the theatre was installed to support the building and a new rigging system. In 2013, a state-of-the-art sprinkler system was installed.
"75th Diamond Jubilee Anniversary Season"
The Ogunquit Playhouse celebrated its 75th year in 2007 with seven shows that performed to record-breaking audiences. The season included a revival of 2006's Menopause the Musical, The Full Monty (musical) with Hunter Foster and Sally Struthers, Crazy for You (musical) with Rue McClanahan, La Cage aux Folles, The King and I with Lorenzo Lamas, Hairspray (musical), and closed with a revival of The Full Monty (musical) with Hunter Foster and Sally Struthers.
"80th Anniversary Season"
The Playhouse celebrated 80 years in theatre with the most successful season to-date that included Sally Struthers in Always, Patsy Cline and 9 to 5 (musical), Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific (musical), Carson Kressley in Damn Yankees (musical) The Boston Red Sox Version, and Ballroom with a Twist featuring celebrity pros and talents from Dancing with the Stars, American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance, including Anna Trebunskaya and Jonathan Roberts. The season closed with what became the theatre's most popular musical ever, Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story starring Kurt Jenkins. The demand was so high that the show was brought back the following year as the season closer.

Castle of Boutavent

The castle of Boutavent is in Iffendic, France.
The ruins of the castle, built in the Middle Ages, are on a natural rocky spur at the place name Boutavent. The land, surrounded by the forest of Paimpont and the pond of Boutavent, stretches over more that 2 hectares.
It has been confirmed that during the 13th and 14th century, the castle belonged to the Lords of Montfort. It was also part of the goods of the family of Montfort with the Comper, Montfort, Montauban and Gaël castles.
The history of the site goes in pair with legends. It is said that during the 7th century, the castle was the residence of Judicaël, King of Domnonée, and that it had been the place where the King and saint Éloi met. This last was sent to bring peace in a fight for borders between Bretons and French.
The castle is structured into two classical elements: a courtyard and a barnyard, separated by a deep gap. Four buildings which could be guesthouses, are on both sides of the barnyard. The fortification and elements of the barnyard can still be seen.
During the 16th century, the castle was in ruin. The circumstances of the destruction of the fortified site of Boutavent remain mysterious. Maybe it has been dismantled during the War of succession (second half of the 14th century) or in 1373, during the campaign of Bertrand du Guesclin in Brittany, but nothing proves that the castle hasn't been inhabited then.
Many local authors of the 19th century wrote about Boutavent, in particular writers like Poignand, Vigoland or Oresve. Even though these stories constitute rare stories about the site, it is impossible to retrace the entire history of the castle, as there are only a few sources. 
The castle has not been searched yet but many campaigns of consolidation of the relics took place since 2006. During these campaigns, archaeological material has been found (slate, ceramic, ground pavement and glazed tiles).
The site, controlled by Montfort Community, is open to the public since 2005. Maintaining works, strengthening the relics and promoting Boutavent, all three are done in collaboration with the ecomuseum of the district of Montfort, the Regional Archaeology Service and the Eureka Emplois Services welfare-to-work program.

Surinamese literature

The literature of Suriname refers to the literature which has been orally transmitted and Surinamese written literature. The oral literature is still a vital and authentic expression in Suriname. In turn, the influence of the oral culture on the written literature of Suriname is impossible to imagine. At the end of the 18th century the indigenous Surinamese began to write literature. Surinamese Creole literature in particular is "not widely known, nor easily accessible."
"Surinaamse literatuur omvat alle mondelinge en geschreven teksten en andere communicatieve uitingen (interacties) in een van de talen van Suriname, die een aspect van literariteit bezitten. Deze uitingen spelen een rol in het retroactief-historische proces van de vorming van de tradities die de nationale identiteit van Suriname uitmaken."
Met "retroactief-historisch" wordt bedoeld dat de tradities achteraf geconstrueerd worden, zoals vaker voorkomt bij jonge staten.
Talen.
In Suriname worden tweeëntwintig talen gebruikt, waarvan enkele echter uitsluitend in niet-literaire situaties, bijvoorbeeld bij godsdienstige rituelen. De drie belangrijkste literaire talen zijn
In proza wordt het Nederlands het meest gebruikt. In de poëzie houden Nederlands en Sranantongo elkaar in evenwicht, terwijl het Sarnami eerst betrekkelijk recent, na 1977, belangrijk is geworden. Het Surinaams-Javaans, de taal van de op twee na grootste bevolkingsgroep, wordt slechts sporadisch geschreven, terwijl de orale literaire uitingen in die taal op het punt staan geheel te verdwijnen.
Andere talen die gesproken worden zijn het Hakka van de Chinezen, marrontalen zoals het Ndyuka en het Saramaccaans en de verschillende talen van de inheemsen. Alle andere talen (en ook sommige inheemse talen) worden door hooguit enkele honderden mensen gesproken. Met de instroom van immigranten uit Brazilië is het Portugees als omgangstaal van deze groep ook meegekomen.
Orale literatuur.
Orale literatuur bezit een esthetische functie en functioneert in een holistisch kader: het onderscheid tussen sacrale en profane teksten, tussen amusement en onderricht is veelal minder scherp dan in de westerse culturen. Er is een complexe samenhang tussen status en structuur van orale teksten en de wijze waarop de tekst gebracht wordt. De "ritual performance" is van groot belang en teksten maken bijna altijd deel uit van een groter geheel met zang en dans.
De oudste bewoners van Suriname zijn de indianen, of inheemsen. De twee grootste groepen zijn de Kari'na (of Karaïben) en de Lokonon (of Arowakken) die, evenals de kleinere stam der Warau, in de kuststreek wonen. De Tarëno (of Trio), de Wayana en de Akuriyo wonen allen diep in het binnenland, niet ver van de Braziliaanse grens. Elk van deze volkeren heeft eigen verhaalgenres, liedgenres en spreekwoorden. Vertellingen en liederen met bijzondere magische kracht worden gekend door de "pyjai", de sjamaan die bij alle volkeren een cruciale rol vervult. Natuur en bovennatuur, mens en dier vormen voor de inheemsen een onverbrekelijke eenheid. Verhalen werden vastgelegd van en door onder meer Nardo Aluman, A.C. Cirino, Ririhpë, Emelina Sabajo, Tëmeta Wetaru en Fillia Afosoe.
De Afro-Surinamers, nakomelingen van uit Afrika aangevoerde slaven, worden onderscheiden in bosnegers of marrons (in het binnenland) en creolen (in stad en kuststreek). Hun orale cultuur staat sterk in het teken van de winti, de Afro-Surinaamse religie en levenswijze. Van de zes bosnegervolkeren zijn de "Saamaka" en de Ndyuka de grootste. Kleiner zijn de Matawai, de Paamaka, de Aluku (of Boni) en de Kwinti. Elk van deze volkeren heeft eigen verhalen, liederen, dansen, spreekwoorden en raadsels en het vertellen, zingen en dansen heeft telkens bijzondere vormen. Bij de creolen vormen de Anansitori’s een bijzonder genre: uit Afrika geërfde vertellingen rond de spin Anansi, die in de harde slaventijd een bijzondere identificatiefiguur werd en nog steeds in allerlei gedaantes zeer populair is. Twee belangrijke creoolse vertellers waren Aleks de Drie en Harry Jong Loy.
Het sacrale dansritueel van de creolen heet "wintipré" (spel van de geesten). Daarnaast zijn er verschillende vormen van profane spelen, die alle elementen van creools verzet tegen de koloniale overheerser in zich dragen. De "Du" is een gedramatiseerd spel met vaste karakters en werd al in de slaventijd als grootse muzikale komedie gebracht; "lobisingi" en "laku" zijn van latere datum.
Ook de latere immigrantengroepen brachten eigen cultureel erfgoed mee en gaven dat in de loop der jaren een eigen Surinaamse gedaante.
In de Hindostaanse cultuur spelen het oude religieuze gedachtegoed en de oude grote epen als "Rámáyana" en het "Mahábhárata" nog altijd een belangrijke rol. Jaarlijkse opvoeringen van het "Rámlilá", Spel van Ram, vinden een talrijk publiek. Op tal van verhaal-, toneel- en liedvormen begon het leven in de contracttijd en daarna een stempel te zetten. Zeer populair werd de "baithak gáná", die aanvankelijk een begeleidingsmuziek bij toneelopvoeringen was, maar zich geleidelijk aan tot een eigen genre met Surinaamse teksten ontwikkelde. Ook de van Java gekomen contractarbeiders gaven hun cultuuruitingen een Surinaamse gedaante, zoals de verteller Toepon Semoedi liet zien met zijn verhalen. Ook in zang, "wajang" (schimmenspel), toneel, cabaret en dans (de "jaran képang", paardendans) manifesteerde zich het Surinaams-Javaanse cultuurgoed. De andere bevolkingsgroepen (Chinezen, Libanezen, joden) zijn minder nadrukkelijk met eigen manifestaties van cultuur aanwezig in het Surinaamse spectrum.
Geschreven literatuur.
16de en 17de eeuw.
De eerste ontmoetingen met de oudste inwoners van Guiana, de `indianen', leverden vooral veel op aan mythologische beeldvorming. Ongetwijfeld hebben vroegste reisverslagen bijgedragen aan het geloof in het goudmeer Parima (Eldorado) en daarmee de aantrekkingskracht van het gebied op avonturenzoekers vergroot. Eerst tegen het einde van de 17de eeuw werden de voortdurende schermutselingen tussen de Europese mogendheden tot een (voorlopig) einde gebracht, toen bij de Vrede van Breda in 1667 het grondgebied van wat tegenwoordig Suriname en een groot deel van Guyana is, toeviel aan de Republiek der Verenigde Nederlanden. De – soms nog gefantaseerde – contouren van het land Suriname rezen vooralsnog alleen op uit Europese, en dan vooral Nederlandse bronnen, die om die reden deel uitmaken van het verhaal over de vroegste fase van de wording van de Surinaamse letteren. Van een `Surinaamse' geschreven literatuur kan nog niet gesproken worden: het zijn allerlei soorten verslagen, dagboeken, pamfletten en zeemansliedjes die de tekstuele getuigen zijn van een koloniale samenleving-in-wording. Bij de slavenmaatschappij werden geen vraagtekens gezet; het geslacht van Cham was immers tot onderwerping voorbestemd. Fictie is er in deze eeuwen niet geschreven, maar sommige teksten, zoals het dagboek van Elisabeth van der Woude, dat dateert van 1676, kan een esthetische kwaliteit niet ontzegd worden.
1700-1775.
Een groot deel van de 18de eeuw stond in het teken van de aanvallen waarmee weggelopen slaven de plantersmaatschappij teisterden, en de kostbare patrouilles die tegen hen werden ondernomen. Deze gebeurtenissen kwamen aan de orde in verschillende landbeschrijvingen, maar het waren vooral drie niet-Nederlandse auteurs die Suriname als slavenmaatschappij op de kaart zetten: Aphra Behn, Voltaire en John Gabriël Stedman. Het beeld van Suriname als een extreem wrede slavenkolonie is door hen gecreëerd, al is niet altijd uit te maken of zij hun invloed direct of langs de latere weg van de geschiedschrijvingen van J.J. Hartsinck, W.R. baron van Hoëvell of Julien Wolbers hebben uitgeoefend. Aphra Behns "Oroonoko, or The royal slave" uit 1688 werd bijvoorbeeld niet vóór de 20e eeuw in het Nederlands vertaald. Dat neemt niet weg dat zij met de creatie van de nobele slaaf Oroonoko een archetype heeft geschapen voor allerlei varianten van de edele slaaf in latere literatuur. Het expeditieverslag van de Schotse kapitein Stedman "Narrative of a five years' expedition against the revolted Negroes of Surinam" uit 1796 heeft, niet in de laatste plaats ook door de gravures (de `fotografie' van die tijd) op de slavernijverbeelding in tal van 19de-eeuwse prozaverhalen zijn stempel gedrukt.
Twee koloniale figuren schreven opmerkelijk werk over de kolonie: dominee J.W. Kals en gouverneur J.J. Mauricius. Beiden verzetten zich niet tegen de slavernij op zich, maar wel tegen de uitwassen van het systeem en tegen de konkelende planterscoterieën. Met zijn satirische toneelstuk "Het Surinaamsche Leeven" (1771) bevestigde een auteur die zich Don Experientia noemde, het beeld van een maatschappij waarin rapalje het voor het zeggen had en alleen het winstbejag telde. Het Verlichtingsdenken zorgde geleidelijk aan ook voor een ander beeld van de plantagemaatschappij. Negers waren niet langer alleen onbeschaafde wilden. De anonieme "Geschiedenis van een neger" van circa 1770 creëerde de persoon van de goede meester, een karakter dat Elisabeth Maria Post met "Reinhart" (1791-1792) uitwerkte; de briefroman was de eerste Nederlandse fictionele tekst waarin de koloniale problematiek met diepgang werd behandeld.
De zwarte mens was in geen van deze teksten de protagonist. Het spectatoriale geschrift "De denker" uit 1774 introduceerde met de "Geschiedenis van een neger" het zwarte perspectief door het woord te geven aan een Afrikaan die op subtiele wijze het slavernijsysteem over de hekel haalde. Waarschijnlijk hanteerde een witte schrijver zijn pennenveer. Wie zeker voor zichzelf sprak, was Quassie van Timotibo, die met zijn eruditie veler bewondering afdwong. Vanwege zijn collaboratie met de koloniale macht lange tijd beschouwd als een dubieuze figuur, wordt hij nu meer en meer gezien als de verpersoonlijking van een even intelligent als brutaal verzet tegen het systeem dat hem wilde knechten.
1775-1800.
Met de Verlichting was de slavernij een belangwekkend thema binnen de Nederlandstalige literatuur geworden (zie ook Kakera Akotie), voor het eerst ook in de letteren die in de kolonie zelf geschreven werden. De laatste decennia van de 18de eeuw brachten het historische traject van de geschreven literatuur over Suriname op een belangrijke splitsing. De eerste aanzetten tot een autochtoon Surinaamse literatuur kunnen in die tijd worden waargenomen, al blijft Nederland nog lang een belangrijk referentiepunt voor de verbeelding en het culturele leven.
In het laatste kwart van de 18de eeuw is Suriname als wingewest zijn hoogtijdagen voorbij. Dat er dan toch sprake was van een culturele opbloei, kan verklaard worden uit verschillende factoren: het ontstaan van een permanente bevolking, de toenemende interraciale contacten, de sterkere beheersing van de plantage-economie vanuit Paramaribo, en de sterke oriëntatie op Europa waar De Verlichting stuwende impulsen gaf aan de interesse voor het intellectuele leven. Vooral dit laatste trok zijn sporen door de kolonie, waar het met name de joden waren die aan het culturele leven bijdroegen. Zij verplaatsen hun culturele centrum van de Jodensavanne naar Paramaribo, zetten hun eigen organisaties op, maar maakten opmerkelijk genoeg ook deel uit van alle niet-joodse dichtgenootschappen. De joden tekenden ook voor een belangrijke historische bron: het "Essai historique sur la colonie de Surinam" (1788) van David Nassy en anderen.
De vroegste berichten over toneelvoorstellingen dateren van het begin van de jaren '70 van de 18de eeuw. Christenen en joden speelden overwegend dezelfde Europese drama's en kluchten, maar hadden ieder hun eigen schouwburg en toneelgroep, met als meest illuster gezelschap het joodse De Verreezene Phoenix. Er werden belangwekkende linguïstische resultaten geboekt op het gebied van de inheemse en creooltalen, maar afgezien van een enkele tekst in het `Neger-Engelsch' (Sranan), werden al die teksten vastgelegd met het oog op zending en missie. Uit advertenties voor boekenveilingen kan worden opgemaakt dat velen die tot de bovenste klassen behoorden, over uitgebreide boekencollecties beschikten. De mogelijkheden tot onderwijs groeiden, zij het nog niet spectaculair. W.J. Beeldsnyder Matroos begon de eerste drukkerij in 1772 en begon twee jaar later met de uitgave van de eerste krant, de "Weekelyksche Woensdaagsche Surinaamse Courant". Deze zou gevolgd worden door verschillende andere, waarvan "De Surinaamsche Nieuwsvertelder" (1785-1793) opviel door zijn scherpe, satirische stukken. De "Surinaamsche Courant", die voor het eerst verscheen in 1790, zou in allerlei edities tot 1883 blijven bestaan. Echte boekhandels waren er nog niet, maar in 1783 kwam er wel een eerste openbare bibliotheek.
Het genootschapsleven bloeide als nooit tevoren: vrijmetselaarsloges schoten als paddenstoelen uit de grond, er werden wetenschappelijke 'collegies' en verschillende literaire genootschappen opgericht, onder meer De Surinaamsche Lettervrinden die vier bundels "Letterkundige Uitspanningen" uitbracht. In kringen van dit laatste genootschap vinden we de drie markantste mannen (vrouwen werden in deze wereld niet aangetroffen): Jacob Voegen van Engelen die het tijdschrift "De Surinaamsche Artz" uitbracht, Hendrik Schouten die een klein aantal satirische verzen schreef, en de man met het grootste oeuvre: Paul François Roos.
Minstens een deel van hun teksten is nog altijd goed leesbaar, hetzij om hun satirieke kracht (Voegen van Engelen, Schouten), hetzij om hun levendige beschrijfkunst (Roos). Qua geestesgoed waren zij alle drie nog representanten van een koloniale maatschappij waarvan de vruchten naar hun geboorteland, Nederland, gingen. Maar alle drie ook vertoonden zij een bijzondere verknochtheid aan hun nieuwe land, de eerste twee kritischer dan de laatste, wiens rooskleurige beelden althans zeker de slavenwerkelijkheid sterk vertekenden. Alle drie opteerden zij ervoor om niet weg te trekken en zij overleden in Suriname. In belangrijke mate hebben zij ertoe bijgedragen dat voor het eerst in de Surinaamse geschiedenis gesproken kon worden van een levendig literair leven en het ontstaan van een heus literair circuit. Niet-blanken bleven daar vooralsnog geheel buiten.
1800-1890.
'Literatuurontwikkeling' is een concept waar de historicus voor de Surinaamse 19de eeuw niet mee uit de voeten kan. Het belangrijkste oriëntatiepunt voor cultureel Suriname bleef Nederland, maar vanuit Nederland werd Suriname nog altijd alleen afgemeten aan de economische barometer; tot de onderwijswet van 1876 zag het 'moederland' voor zichzelf geen beschavingsmissie in de kolonie weggelegd.
Een in sterke mate door de koloniale censuur gedomineerde samenleving is in de eerste helft van de eeuw geen goede voedingsbodem geweest voor grootse initiatieven, al gaven individuen periodiek wel impulsen aan het literaire leven. Zo was H.C. Focke hoogstwaarschijnlijk de auteur van de opmerkelijke 'Proeve van Neger-Engelsche Poëzy', getiteld "Njoe-jaari-singi Voe Cesaari" uit het midden van de jaren '30. Focke was ook een van de actiefste leden van de Maatschappij tot Nut van 't Algemeen dat in de eerste eeuwhelft de belangrijkste instigator van intellectuele activiteit was, en de auteur van het eerste gedrukte "Neger-Engelsch woordenboek" (1855). J.J. Engelbrecht bracht van 1838 tot 1839 het breed cultureel-maatschappelijke maandschrift "De kolonist" uit, dat in zijn vijftien nummers belangwekkende beschouwende stukken afdrukte. E.A. Jellico van Gogh en E. Soesman meenden dat ook de kolonie een letterlievend genootschap moest hebben en richtten in 1853 Oefening Kweekt Kennis op; het bracht in 1856 een "Jaarboekje" uit met een prozastuk van de passante Christina van Gogh dat nadrukkelijk in functie stond van de christelijke moraal, en bijdragen van van Soesman en Van Gogh (die zijn psychologische novelle "De gouden sleutel" - de eerste in de Surinaamse letteren - in de kolonie situeerde).
Dominee Cornelis van Schaick, die van 1852 tot 1861 in Suriname verbleef, betoonde zich een energiek publicist met stukken in Surinaamse kranten, met een "Dichtbundeltje voor de Surinaamsche jeugd" en met de om zijn progressieve ideeën opmerkelijke roman "De manja". Van Schaick en Focke behoorden tot de oprichters van "West-Indië" (1854-1858), dat een waardig opvolger bleek van "De kolonist". Programmatische standpunten over literatuur vindt men er niet in, zoals de afwezigheid van een reflectie op wat er geschreven werd in de gehele 19de eeuw een imposant vacuüm vertoont. Ch. Landré en F.A.C. Dumontier, beiden eveneens redacteuren van het "West-Indië", namen in 1857 het initiatief tot de Surinaamsche Koloniale Bibliotheek, die een eeuw de belangrijkste boekerij van Suriname zou zijn.
In de bijdragen van Van Gogh en Soesman aan het "Jaarboekje 1856" kan men nog een (ver)laat aansluiten bij de romantiek zien, maar de grote internationale literaire stromingen zijn blijkbaar nooit krachtig genoeg geweest om tegen de Amazonestroom in, Suriname te bereiken. Dat in de 19de eeuw de opvattingen over literatuur drastisch veranderden, dat de individuele schrijverspersoonlijkheid een totaal ander gewicht kreeg: in Suriname merkte men er ogenschijnlijk niets van. Er waren wel weldadigheidsgezelschappen en loges, maar geen rederijkerskamers die het internationale debat konden overnemen en stuwkracht geven.
In het toneelleven is er wel, bijna de hele eeuw lang, een opmerkelijke activiteit geweest. In de eerste decennia tekenden de gezelschappen Oeffening Kweekt Kunst en De Verreezene Phoenix voor het theateraanbod. Van het laatste gezelschap scheidde zich een groep af, die onder de naam Theatre Graave Straat verderging. Na een tijd van malaise in de jaren '30, opende het toneelgenootschap Thalia in 1840 de deuren van zijn nieuwe schouwburg. Het overwegend joodse gezelschap begon aan een roemruchte geschiedenis, die al vanaf 1853 getekend zou worden door de nooit eindigende strubbelingen rond het verval en herstel van zijn gebouw. De programmering was bijna altijd van Europese snit. De toneel"schrijf"kunst van Surinaamse oorsprong is in de 19de eeuw wel in extreem sterke mate door zijn discontinuïteit gekenmerkt geweest. Er is een handvol oorspronkelijke stukken bekend en daarnaast een klein aantal bewerkingen van Europese toneelstof.
In Nederland woedde het abolitionisme-debat al vanaf de vroege 19de eeuw. Maar wanneer de balans wordt opgemaakt over de eerste helft van de eeuw, dan blijkt dat geen enkele grote, invloedrijke tekst aan de slavernij in Suriname gewijd is geweest. Er is geen toonaangevend boek geweest dat de aandacht van het grote publiek op de wantoestanden in de West-Indische koloniën heeft weten te vestigen, laat staan dat er een werk is geweest dat de publieke opinie wezenlijk heeft beïnvloed. Eerst wanneer W.R. baron van Hoëvell in 1854 zijn "Slaven en vrijen onder de Nederlandsche wet" publiceert, lijkt in Nederland een groter publiek oog te krijgen voor een situatie die in de overzeese gebiedsdelen van de meeste andere koloniale mogendheden al verleden tijd was.
De afschaffing van de slavernij in 1863 zorgde allereerst voor een opleving van de journalistiek. Grootse winstpunt van de eeuw is de uitbreiding van het onderwijs geweest: bestonden er aan het begin alleen nog maar enkele privé-schooltjes voor de blanken en mulatten uit de hogere maatschappelijke klassen, in 1876 waren er tal van scholen en kwam er een onderwijswet die een algemene leerplicht afkondigde.
Ook in de jaren na de afschaffing van de slavernij doken er weer enkele bijzondere schrijversindividuen op. Kwamina (ps. van A. Lionarons) schreef opmerkelijke romans die zich afspelen in zijn eigen eeuw. "Jetta" (1869) en "Nanni of Vruchten van het vooroordeel" (1881) zijn gesitueerd in een decor van plantages in verval en een kolonie die zich oriënteert op een ander economisch stelsel. Daartoe introduceerde Kwamina voor het eerst binnen de Surinaamse letteren een uit de Caraïbische literatuur bekende hoofdfiguur: de mulattin. Hij bepleit menswaardige omstandigheden voor de arbeiders, maar zijn wereldbeeld is niet wezenlijk anders dan bij de Nederlands-koloniale schrijvers vóór hem.
Niettemin was Kwamina een autochtone Surinamer uit een oud Surinaams geslacht en zijn werk - in het Nederlands met dialogen in het `Neger-Engelsch' - moet evenzeer tot de Surinaamse literatuur gerekend worden, als dat van de matawai bosneger Johannes King. Deze schreef duizenden pagina's proza in het Sranan, waaronder een aantal opzienbarende visioenen. Met zijn reisverslagen en dagboeken betoonde King zich al evenzeer evangelisch bezield als het merendeel van de schrijvers van zijn eeuw.
1890-1923.
Het deel van de kolonie Suriname dat kan gerekend worden tot de geletterde stadscultuur, zag na 1890 een opbloei van het culturele leven zoals het die alleen een eeuw vroeger gekend had. Maar al speelde dat festijn zich dan bijna uitsluitend af binnen de grenzen van Paramaribo, de `betere klasse' was al lang niet meer uitsluitend blank en die klasse verbreedde zich ook aanzienlijk. De nieuwe groepen immigranten uit Brits-Indië en Java bleven daar vooralsnog helemaal buiten.
De moderne techniek deed zijn intrede in de hoofdstad met elektrische straatverlichting, telegrafieverbindingen en de eerste films. De kwaliteit van het drukwerk verbeterde; het was vooral drukkerij/uitgeverij H.B. Heyde die met een hele reeks belangwekkende boekuitgaven kwam. Het bibliotheekwezen groeide exponentieel en ontwikkelde zich, evenals het journalistieke leven, grofweg langs drie banen: de evangelische, de katholieke en de neutrale. Tal van kranten verschenen en zorgden ook met hun onderlinge debatten voor leven in de brouwerij; de "Nieuwe Surinaamsche Courant" bracht meestal een hele pagina met Surinaamse berichtgeving in rubrieken als `Stadsnieuws' en `Kunst- en letternieuws'. De contouren van een serieuze toneel- en literaire kritiek tekenden zich af, inclusief enkele gedachtewisselingen over de functie van kritiek, waaraan ook een van de vele nieuwe leesverenigingen met haar tijdschrift "Kennis Adelt" een bijdrage leverde. In bijna alle krantenbesprekingen, ongeacht de denominatie van de krant, werd een combinatie aangehouden van een ethische norm wat de tekst betreft, met een artistiek oordeel over het acteren. Richtsnoer was nog altijd wat er in Holland op dit vlak gedacht werd. Zij die actief voeling wilden onderhouden met alles wat Hollands was, verenigden zich in de in 1898 opgerichte Groep Suriname van het Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond.
Intussen was Suriname voor Nederland nog verder weggeschoven naar de periferie van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden dan het altijd al was. Weliswaar rekende Jan de Liefde zijn opmerkelijke korte roman "De geschiedenis van een kankantrieboom" uit 1891 af met de stereotiepe wijze van beschrijven van de Surinaamse koloniale geschiedenis, maar de beeldvorming over Suriname en de Surinamers in de Nederlandse letteren hield over de gehele lijn - en zeker in de missioneringsliteratuur - nog vast aan oude schematiseringen, om niet te zeggen racistische clichés. Voor de lezende Surinamers die zichzelf in de spiegel van die lectuur zagen, moet dat zeker niet bevorderlijk hebben gewerkt bij het corrigeren van het zelfbeeld. De sterk neerlandocentrische cultuurpolitiek na 1876, werkte daar ook bepaald niet aan mee. In de beginjaren van de 20e eeuw vertoonden verschillende geschriften als reactie op het verval van de plantagelandbouw de neiging om de negentiende eeuw met een zekere nostalgie te bezien. In de memoires-achtige stukken van J.G. Spalburg, E.J. Bartelink, A.W. Marcus en Jacques Samuels is het verval van de landbouwkolonie aanleiding tot lamentaties over de `goede oude tijd'.
Toch zijn er ook verschijnselen waar te nemen van een zeer geleidelijke geestelijke heroriëntatie. Door het weinig diplomatieke optreden van gouverneur De Savornin Lohman zien we een versterking van het landsgevoel, zich uitend in tal van gelegenheidsgedichten. In de Surinaamse geschiedenis en het Surinaamse volksleven werd de stof gevonden voor nieuwe verbeelding, veelal werk van realistische aard. Drie persoonlijkheden hebben op bijzondere wijze hun inbreng in het literaire leven gehad. G.G.T. Rustwijk gaf met "Matrozenrozen" (1915) de eerste bundel van een in Suriname geboren dichter. J.G. Spalburg kwam met de eerste Surinaamse bundel prozaschetsen "Bruine Mina de koto-missi" (1913). Met "Een Beschavingswerk" (1923), gepubliceerd onder de naam Ultimus, schreef Richard O'Ferrall de eerste Surinaamse sleutelroman; het satirische karakter van de tekst maakt die binnen zijn tijd tot een opmerkelijk boek. Het werk van alle drie draagt nog talrijke reminiscenties aan de slaventijd en de landbouweconomie, maar alle drie kijken óók verder. Als representanten van de rationaliteit en moderniteit, droegen zij bij aan het verjongde intellectuele leven van hun dagen.
De oriëntatie op Nederland is verder met kracht weersproken in het werk van vijf Surinamers die na 1900 publiceerden. Henri François Rikken publiceerde in "De Surinamer" drie grote en veel gelezen historische romans in feuilletonvorm (onder meer "Codjo, de brandstichter")en betoonde zich daarmee de meest getalenteerde schrijver van zijn tijd. "Jacques Samuels" schreef een reeks prozastukken die pas in 1946 werden gebundeld in "Schetsen en typen uit Suriname". Ook Johann F. Heymans met zijn historische roman "Suriname als ballingsoord of Wat een vrouw vermag" (1911), E.J. Bartelink met plantersherinneringen, A.W. Marcus met poëzie en redes en voorts enkele scribenten van naturalistische schetsen in "De Surinamer" hebben een literaire productie nagelaten die duidelijk een eigen Surinaams stempel draagt. Men ziet in hun werk ook de vroegste experimenten met de Surinaams-Nederlandse taalvariant, wat hen niet altijd in dank werd afgenomen. In de kleurrijke straatzanger Goedoe Goedoe Thijm vonden orale en geschreven letteren hun verbindende schakel: hij bezong de actualiteit van de eerste decennia van de 20e eeuw, maar liet zijn liederen ook als pamflet drukken.
Voor het `Neger-Engelsch' tekende predikant C.P. Rier met vertalingen van boeken uit de Bijbel en liederen voor hoogwaardige teksten. Het Sranan dook nog een enkele keer op in een gedicht of een cabarettekst, maar een tekst in een van de andere volkstalen bleef verder, buiten het kerkelijke leven en buiten de orale letteren, uiterst zeldzaam.
Het toneelleven van na 1890 kende minder organisatiestructuur dan in de voorgaande eeuw. Thalia ging roerige jaren in. Het bleef voornamelijk repertoiretoneel brengen, maar niet meer in abonnementenseries. Wat er aan toneelvernieuwing was, moest gezocht worden bij andere gezelschappen zoals Oefening Baart Kennis en talrijke andere die slechts kort bestonden. De eerste Surinaamse toneelstukken werden geschreven en opgevoerd: "Lucij" van R.A.P.C. O'Ferrall in 1896, "Te laat of De wraak van een' Boer" van Jacques Samuels in 1900 en de Wagneriaans-mythische opera "Het pand der goden" van Johannes Nicolaas Helstone in 1906. Joh.C. Marcus maakte met het ook in druk verschenen Deugd en belooning of Hoogmoed komt voor den val duidelijk hoezeer het Nederlandse toneel ook in 1910 nog altijd het voorbeeld aanreikte: het toneelspel bevat geen enkele referentie aan Suriname en was een variant op een van de vele negentiende-eeuwse Nederlandse stukken rond het vader/rechter-motief. De rellerige sfeer rond de opvoeringen van het stuk liet zien dat het nog zeker geen aanbeveling was om een toneelschrijver van eigen bodem te zijn.
Opvallend in het theateraanbod werden drie soorten voorstellingen: de `soirées variées' (cabaretavonden met een gemengd programma waarmee vooral Johannes Kruisland beroemd werd), de kinderoperettes van G.G.T. Rustwijk en de operettevoorstellingen onder leiding van J.W. Bueno de Mesquita. Het waren deze drie genres die ervoor zorgden dat het theater een huis werd voor een steeds breder publiek. Dans- en sportverenigingen brachten in hun programmering cabaretnummers, kluchten, sketches en soms ook kleine dramatische stukken. Ook zij hebben eraan meegewerkt de drempels van de theatertempels te verlagen. Nog steeds bleven de `mindere klassen' grotendeels buiten het culturele gebeuren, maar de transformatie van de orale volkscultuur naar het volkstheater van de tweede helft van de 20e eeuw, zette met de veranderende voordrachtskunst van de eerste helft van de eeuw een beslissende stap.
1923-1957.
Met de verschijning in 1923 van de dichtbundel "De glorende dag" van Lodewijk Lichtveld – die als Albert Helman bekend zou worden – deed zich een nieuw fenomeen voor. Al eerder waren boeken van Surinaamse auteurs in Nederland verschenen. Maar 1923 markeert het beginpunt van Nederland als land van vestiging voor veel schrijvers. De Surinaamse migrantenliteratuur werd geboren, een literatuur die veel gemeen heeft met die van Suriname, maar die zich ook in minstens zoveel opzichten onderscheidt van de vaderlandse letteren. Met een geheel andere positie van de auteurs in het literaire krachtenveld en in de wereld, veranderde ook hun perspectief; met de verandering van werkelijkheid en perspectief werden nieuwe thema's aan de orde gesteld en die vroegen vaak om een andere vormbeheersing. Albert Helman schreef met "Zuid-Zuid-West" (1926) een klassieke heimweeroman, maar de echte migrantenmotieven werden door de eerste generatie eenlingen nog weinig geprononceerd aan de orde gesteld en zouden eerst met de grote migraties in de jaren '60 gemeengoed van de migrantenschrijvers worden.
Een mogelijke verklaringsgrond daarvoor is dat de eerste schrijvers die in Nederland neerstreken - Albert Helman, Rudie van Lier, Hugo Pos –, cultureel al behoord hadden tot de geassimileerde bovenlaag van de Surinaamse samenleving en in Nederland aansluiting vonden bij literaire gezelschappen. Een afzonderlijke positie bekleedde Anton de Kom. Hij vond aansluiting bij het marxistisch georiënteerde tijdschrift "Links Richten" en beproefde met zijn grote essay "Wij slaven van Suriname" (1934) een herschrijving van de Surinaamse geschiedenis als aanklacht tegen het Nederlandse kolonialisme.
Met de uittocht die begon met Helman – de schrijver die naar omvang en kwaliteit veruit het belangrijkste oeuvre opbouwde –, was het voor een flinke poos gedaan met het schrijven van belangwekkende Nederlandse teksten in Suriname. Tot omstreeks 1950 verliep het culturele leven goeddeels langs de gebaande paden van de religieuze denominaties: de katholieke, evangelische, joodse en steeds sterker ook hindoeïstische en islamitische kerken. Leverden de pennenveren vooralsnog eerder traditionele pluimstrijkerijen op dan gedurfd werk van een persoonlijke signatuur, het is vooral in de sensibilisering voor het woord en de literaire vorm dat de kerken betekenis hebben gehad voor jongeren die later van zich zouden doen horen. De kranten van het interbellum boden zowat de enige mogelijkheid tot publiceren aan schrijvers. Met gedichten over het Nederlandse vorstenhuis, feuilletons van Nederlandse makelij en kunstrubrieken die nog altijd voor 98 % over Nederlandse toneelkunst en literatuur gingen, versterkten zij de oriëntatie van de hogere- en middenklasse op het zogenaamde `moederland'.
De Tweede Wereldoorlog is in de periode 1923-1957 van beslissende betekenis geweest voor het sociaal-culturele leven. De legering van Amerikaanse troepen en het afgesneden-zijn van Nederland betekende dat de Surinamers zich steeds sterker bewust werden van de eigen potenties en de mogelijkheid tot een zelfstandige positie binnen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden (die met het Statuut in 1954 haar politiek beslag zou krijgen). De Noord-Amerikaanse invloed werd op veel terreinen merkbaar. Het zou te ver gaan aan die invloed het nieuwe naoorlogse elan toe te schrijven, maar geheel los daarvan stond dat toch ook niet. Naoorlogs bastion van de oriëntatie op Nederland werd de Stichting voor Culturele Samenwerking, Sticusa, die in Nederland zetelde, met het Cultureel Centrum Suriname als haar uitvoerend orgaan in Paramaribo. Overigens heeft het CCS gaandeweg ook meer betekenis gekregen voor de surinamisering van het cultuuraanbod.
In de jaren '50 werden verschillende nieuwe gelegenheden tot onderwijs gecreëerd. Uit de toename van het aantal boekhandels blijkt dat het in deze periode niet langer alleen de lichtgekleurde elite was die boeken kocht, maar dat ook andere groepen tot de kopers gingen behoren. Ook in de groei van de collectie, het aantal filialen en het aantal uitleningen van de CCS-bibliotheek is duidelijk af te lezen dat in Suriname een breed lezerspubliek was gevonden. Er vond een uitwaaiering van media-activiteiten plaats, die zonder twijfel veel heeft bijgedragen aan de culturele ontplooiing van de verschillende bevolkingsgroepen en langs die weg aan de versterking van de groepsidentiteiten. De wereld van de beeldende kunst gaf dezelfde ontwikkeling te zien als die in de muziek en het theater: van een gezapig traditionalisme in het interbellum naar het hectische zoeken na de Tweede Wereldoorlog en de bruisende activiteit van de jaren '60.
Door de repatriëring van enkele schrijvers kreeg het Nederlandstalige literaire leven van na de Tweede Wereldoorlog een belangrijke impuls. Albert Helman – op velerlei gebied actief, op velerlei gebied bestreden - schreef in Suriname enkele van zijn belangrijkste romans en toneelwerken. Wim Bos Verschuur, Hugo Pos en Wim Salm voorzagen het toneelleven van vers bloed. De kranten volgden hen op de voet, ruimden steeds meer plaats in voor de literaire wereld en verkenden behoedzaam de eigen regio. Literaire tijdschriften heeft het tijdvak 1923-1957 niet gekend, maar er zijn twee periodieken geweest die tot op zekere hoogte de functie van letterkundig tijdschrift overnamen: "Spectrum" en "Opbouw". Het veruit belangrijkste culturele Nederlandstalige tijdschrift, met een serieuze literatuur-kritische component, is "De West-Indische Gids" geweest, dat verscheen van 1919 tot 1960.
De belangrijkste ontwikkeling binnen Suriname in de jaren 1923-1957 deed zich voor in de volkstalen, en dan met name in het Sranantongo, in iets minder sterke mate ook in het Surinaams-Nederlands. In een land met een onderwijsstelsel op Nederlandse leest en met media - de kranten en vanaf 1935 de radiozender AVROS - die alle taalgebruik legden langs de meetlat van het ABN, vroeg het moed om in geschrifte de eigen Surinaamse variant van het Nederlands te gebruiken. Toch hebben verschillende schrijvers die moed opgebracht. Er is een aantal ijkingsmomenten aan te wijzen in een taalontwikkeling die langzaam opschoof in de richting van het Surinaams-Nederlands: het toneelstuk "Woeker" van Wim Bos Verschuur in 1936, de verhalen van Peter Schüngel in het maandblad "Suriname-Zending" in de jaren 1942-46, de roman "Viottoe" van Kees Neer uit 1948, de vertaling in 1954 door Albert Helman van Marc Connelly's "Green pastures" tot "Grazige weiden", de opvoering van Wim Salms "Sjinnie" in 1956 en de herinneringen van M.Th. Hijlaard "Zij en ik" (die overigens pas in 1978 in druk verschenen).
Het Sranan en de creoolse volkscultuur kregen een forse duw voorwaarts van het in 1944 gevormde Comité Pohama dat `Sranannetie' organiseerde: culturele avonden met liederen en voordrachten in het Sranan. Maar liefst tien jaar lang, van 1946 tot 1956, gaf het comité "Foetoe-boi" uit, een maandblad dat consequent aandacht besteedde aan allerlei aspecten van de creoolse taal en cultuur. Het was het eerste breed-culturele blad in het Sranan dat, gemaakt door `kleine luyden', een dam opwierp tegen de neerlandocentrische oriëntatie van de hogere klassen. De motor achter deze activiteiten was de onderwijzer J.G.A. Koenders. Hij pleitte in tal van opstellen, met taalboekjes en liederenbundels voor een herleving van het `Surinaams' en een radicale transformatie van het nog altijd koloniale onderwijssysteem dat `onze psyche heeft ontredderd en ons verstand verschrompelde'.
Wie Eegie Sanie (Onze Eigen Dingen) zou Koenders' belangrijkste erfgenaam zijn. Deze groep van studenten en arbeiders rond de charismatische Eddy Bruma, ontstond in Nederland rond 1950 en verplaatste zich enkele jaren later naar Suriname, waar de `Sranannetie' nieuw leven werd ingeblazen, met toneelstukken van onder andere Bruma en Ané Doorson waarin de slavernijgeschiedenis en het erfleven werden geënsceneerd. Van Wie Eegie Sanie ging een belangrijke impuls uit tot verandering van het culturele klimaat en het historische bewustzijn, eerst en vooral van de creolen. In het Sranan werden de opmerkelijkste resultaten geboekt in het toneel. Met haar voorlichtende stukken verwierf Sophie Redmond een prominente plaats in de transitie van de orale creoolse cultuur naar de geschreven en `formele' cultuur. Daarnaast werd Paula Velders vertaling van Shakespeare's "Midzomernachtsdroom" een belangrijk moment in de emancipatie van het literaire Sranan. De toneelwereld liet het beste zien hoezeer de Surinaamse wereld cultureel steeds pluriformer werd, hoe de transformatie van de orale cultuur naar de geschreven cultuur zich voltrok, hoe de taalkeuze werd herijkt, het nationale historische cultuurgoed inzet werd van theatrale verbeelding en de Surinamisering zich ook in de acteursbezetting liet zien. Het toneelgenootschap Thalia beleefde na de oorlog opnieuw een bloeiperiode.
Onder leiding van Hugo Pos werden de deuren ook opengezet voor andere dan joodse en blanke acteurs, er werden stukken uit de regio opgevoerd en werk van Surinaamse auteurs, of buitenlandse vertaald en bewerkt voor het Surinaamse publiek. Niettemin bleef het accent nog sterk liggen op werk uit Europa en Noord-Amerika. Maar langzamerhand zagen de theaters ook steeds vaker andere vormen dan het `Thalia-toneel' en daarmee werd een publiek uit andere lagen van de bevolking naar de theaters gelokt.
In de eerste eeuwhelft bracht cabaretier Johannes Kruisland in zijn `one-man-shows' altijd ook nummers in het `Neger-Engelsch'. Bonte Avonden genoten een grote populariteit en in de jaren '20 en '30 werden ook korte scènes in het Sranan geïntroduceerd, geschreven door Albertina Rijssel. Zo ontstond het creoolse volkstoneel, dat wortelt in de orale traditie van "banya", "du", "laku" en "lobisingi", maar een andere gedaante kreeg op de toneelplanken. Al in 1927 zorgde het geheel zwarte vrouwengezelschap Excelsior onder leiding van J. Vriese, voorman van De Neger Vereeniging in Suriname, voor voorstellingen in Moengo. Een ander gezelschap van zwarte vrouwen, De Echo, zorgde in 1929 voor opvoeringen in Thalia die voor veel commotie zorgden bij een op schandalen belust publiek. Na de Tweede Wereldoorlog trokken jonge groepen steeds meer publiek uit de volksklassen. Zij creëerden het genre van het creoolse volkstoneel, overwegend gespeeld in het Sranan met flarden Surinaams-Nederlands. Dit toneel berust op een combinatie van tragiek en humor, een realistische weergave van alledaagse problemen aangevuld met hilarische effecten. Omdat de tekst lang niet altijd wordt uitgeschreven bestaat de mogelijkheid tot improvisatie en inspelen op de actualiteit. De kranten, die na de oorlog dagelijks begonnen te verschijnen, hebben met een toneelkritiek op geregelde basis zeker meegewerkt aan de groei van de belangstelling voor het theater bij een breder publiek.
Het Hindostaanse toneel speelde zich nog voor 99 % af in de districten. In de jaren '20 werden de eerste historische stukken opgevoerd, gebaseerd op dramatisch werk van Indiërs maar door Surinaamse auteurs al enigszins aangepast aan de lokale omstandigheden. Hindi was de belangrijkste toneeltaal (van Hindi en andere Indiase talen bediende zich ook de eerste Hindostaanse dichter, de immigrant Rahmān Khān). De oude Indische drama's met overwegend religieuze thema's bleven dominant, maar in de loop der tijd werden de teksten vereenvoudigd, het Sarnami werd frequenter gebruikt en er werden ook stukken van actuele en realistische inhoud gespeeld.
In 1950 trad een groep bosnegers op in theater Bellevue, wat beschouwd kan worden als een significant moment in de theatralisering en secularisatie van bosnegercultuur. De inbreng in theaters van bosnegers, en ook van Javanen, Chinezen en inheemsen bleef overigens nog uiterst bescheiden. Wel zag het tijdvak 1923-1957 een sterke groei van de sociaal-culturele organisatie van praktisch alle bevolkingsgroepen.
1957-1975.
Nooit eerder werd over zo'n breed front een heroriëntatie gezocht op het eigene als in de jaren na 1957, en nooit eerder was de eigen identiteit zo indringend object van literaire verbeelding. Elementen uit de orale tradities werden door verschillende auteurs gebracht binnen de nieuwe context van geschreven teksten. Desalniettemin hebben die orale tradities minder nadrukkelijk gefungeerd als dam tegen de invloed van de Europese cultuur, als in dezelfde tijd orale elementen dat deden in de geschreven letteren van de Nederlandse Antillen. Een verklaring hiervoor kan zijn, dat in Suriname de orale tradities onder de verschillende bevolkingsgroepen nog levendig aanwezig waren en dus niet de herleving behoefden, die de zo goed als geheel verdwenen orale literatuur op de Antillen nodig had.
Trefossa gaf met zijn bundel "Trotji" in 1957 de opmaat tot een waaier van literaire activiteit. Verschillende dichters hebben getuigd van de inspiratie die uitging van zijn poëzie, maar er waren tal van factoren die in een complexe onderlinge wisselwerking en versterking bepalend zijn geweest voor de buitengewone dynamiek in de letteren. Rond 1950 was het onderwijssysteem op de helling gezet en die vernieuwing begon haar vruchten af te werpen. Het bibliotheekwezen groeide exponentieel en bediende tienduizenden lezers in stad en district. Paramaribo telde meer drukkerijen dan ooit tevoren, wat een belangrijk gegeven was voor de literaire productie in eigen beheer (uitgeverijen hebben slechts een kleine rol gespeeld). Sticusa en CCS beschikten over de middelen om met reisbeurzen, stipendia, aankopen en prijzen de schrijvers te ondersteunen. De kranten maakten nooit eerder zoveel ruimte vrij voor critici die toegewijd de culturele ontwikkelingen volgden.
Levendige literaire debatten - met de dichter Corly Verlooghen veelvuldig in een hoofdrol - vulden de kolommen. De literaire tijdschriften "Tongoni", "Soela", "Moetete" en "Kolibri" boden aankomende auteurs een platform, zoals ook de tweewekelijkse literaire pagina van het dagblad Suriname dat van 1967 tot 1969 deed, en in Nederland het tijdschrift "Mamjo". Met uitzondering van "Kolibri" en "Mamjo", die tegen de gezapigheid van een voorgekookt literair nationalisme schopten, fungeerden alle tijdschriften als bloemlezingen zonder scherp afgebakende programmatorische uitgangspunten. Veel continuïteit in het bijdragen aan tijdschriften was er niet: wie de tijdschriften inventariseert, komt op een totaal van 72 auteurs. Daarvan hebben er slechts twee bijgedragen aan meer dan twee tijdschriften: Shrinivási en Slory - inmiddels gecanoniseerde dichters met een oeuvre waarin het politieke en het persoonlijke elkaar in balans houden. Veel continuïteit boden die bladen op zichzelf overigens ook niet: "Soela" bestond met zeven nummers nog het langst.
In de theaters zorgden jonge regisseurs rond 1970 voor krachtige vernieuwende impulsen. Zo ging Henk Tjon een vruchtbare samenwerking aan met schrijfster Thea Doelwijt in het Doe-theater. Duidelijk is overigens dat het volkstheater met groepen als NAKS van Eugène Drenthe en Jagritie van Goeroedath Kallasingh de veruit grootste aantallen toeschouwers trok.
Jarenlang beheerste de AVROS de ether, maar opeens kwam er een hele reeks radiostations bij, waar de volkstalen nadrukkelijk in de programmering aan bod kwamen, en waar ruimte werd gecreëerd voor hoorspelen (van onder meer Wilfred Teixeira, Harry Jong Loy en Wilfred Grimmèr) en culturele programma's. In 1965 kreeg Suriname ook zijn eigen televisiestation; van een substantiële dramaproductie voor tv is echter geen sprake geweest.
De val van het laatste kabinet-Pengel in 1969 luidde een politiek uiterst rumoerige tijd in. Het waren vooral dichters die zich, met strijdpoëzie van onvervalste signatuur en afgestemd op een massapubliek, tot spreekbuis maakten van de maatschappelijke onvrede en het verlangen naar de politieke onafhankelijkheid van Suriname. R. Dobru reikte vanaf het midden van de jaren '60 de vormtaal aan, waarop veel van de geëngageerde dichters zich oriënteerden. Zijn gedicht `Wan bon' werd de bekendste belijdenis van het samenhorigheidsverlangen van het Surinaamse volk. Corly Verlooghen - die zelf ook nationalistische poëzie dichtte - schreef dan weer het gedicht Dit wankel huis dat de scepsis over de Surinaamse eenheid verwoordt.
Opmerkelijk genoeg - en niet geheel in lijn met het eenheidsgeloof van die jaren - bleef de literaire productie bijna geheel beperkt tot werk in het Nederlands (Bhai, Verlooghen, Shrinivási, Bernardo Ashetu) of Sranan (Trefossa - die ook het Surinaamse volkslied schreef -, Eugène Rellum, Johanna Schouten-Elsenhout, Michaël Slory, Eddy Pinas). Shrinivási schreef weliswaar de eerste gedichten in het Sarnami, Akanamba de eerste poëzie in het Saamaka en André Pakosie in het Ndyuka, maar hele bundels werden er in geen van deze talen gepubliceerd. Sarnami werd gaandeweg een belangrijke toneeltaal; de belangrijkste Hindostaanse toneelschrijver, Goeroedath Kallasingh, vroeg nadrukkelijk aandacht voor het Hindostaanse cultuurgoed als deel van het nationale erfgoed.
Trefossa introduceerde in zijn poëzie ook migrantenmotieven en hij stond daarin niet alleen. Zeer velen van het tijdvak 1957-1975 hebben jarenlang in het buitenland gewoond en van dat verblijf overzee ook de invloed ondergaan. Zo schreef Paul Marlee met "Proefkonijn" (1985) een roman in de internationale modernistische traditie, die geanalyseerd kan worden als een weefsel van intertextuele verwijzingen. In Nederland werden Surinaamse auteurs gevonden rond het Leidse studententijdschrift "Mamjo" (met John Leefmans en Rudi Kross als scherpe scribenten), rond de vereniging Ons Suriname met haar jaarschrift "Fri" en het Surinaams Verbond met zijn tweemaandelijkse "Djogo".
Na 1968 gaven Leo Ferrier en Bea Vianen de maatschappelijk betrokken maar psychologisch uitgewerkte roman de grootste vlucht sinds de boeken van Albert Helman. De laatste bleef overigens zelf met eigen werk en met allerlei activiteiten nadrukkelijk aanwezig, maar werd door de jongste schrijversgeneratie scherp bekritiseerd als iemand die te zeer de oren liet hangen naar het Nederlandse model.
Verschillende Surinaamse dichters bouwden een groot oeuvre op en werden daarvoor met literaire prijzen bekroond. Het proza kende een opleving, vooral van het korte verhaal, maar uiteindelijk konden slecht weinig prozaschrijvers de gewekte verwachtingen waarmaken. Na zijn debuutbundel "Spanhoek" bundelde Coen Ooft geen werk meer. Nel Bradley, Benny Ooft, Thea Doelwijt, Ruud Mungroo, Rodney Russel publiceerden na hun vroege werk weinig meer, of legden zich - zoals Doelwijt - toe op andere genres. De komeetachtige entree in de letteren van Leo Ferrier met zijn "Átman" werd na de korte roman "El sisilobi" bruusk afgebroken. Alleen Bea Vianen bleef met vijf romans een decennium aanwezig als criticaster van de verloedering in Suriname. De grote oeuvrebouwers ná Helman zouden pas na 1975 het podium beklimmen.
De wonderbaarlijke ontplooiing van poëzietalent nadat Suriname altijd voornamelijk rijmelaars had voortgebracht, had ook een schaduwzijde. Bij gebrek aan een goede literaire infrastructuur, brachten zelfs de beste dichters hun werk in eigen beheer uit. Rijp en groen lag naast elkaar op hetzelfde boekenschap. Alleen al in 1975 verscheen er bijna elke week een dichtbundel. De markt dreigde verzadigd te raken.
Een verontrustend verschijnsel is geweest dat juist onder migrantenschrijvers zich enkele ernstige gevallen van psychose hebben voorgedaan, die mogelijk verklaard kunnen worden vanuit een complex samenstel van sociaal-culturele en psychologische factoren als de `meerzijdige culturele gebondenheid' en de problematische identificatie van de zwarte mens met een spiegelbeeld dat door de witte mens is aangereikt.
Van een heel andere orde ten slotte is de vraag in hoeverre het politiek geëngageerde werk van de jaren '60 en begin jaren '70 werkelijk zoden aan de dijk heeft gezet. Er leek zoiets als een eenheidsbeleven door Suriname te waren, zeker als we afgaan op wat er in literaire teksten over is terug te vinden. Maar terugblikkend op het Suriname van vóór 1975 zou menig schrijver later sceptische geluiden laten horen. Twee van de belangrijkste van de nieuwe generatie hadden overigens al rond 1970 hun debuut gemaakt: Edgar Cairo en Astrid Roemer. Zij zouden zo nadrukkelijk hun stempel drukken op de Surinaamse literatuur in Nederland van de jaren '80 en '90 dat hun werk thuishoort bij de migrantenliteratuur van ná de onafhankelijkheid.
1975-2000.
Enkele belangrijke thema's van de nationalistische generatie vielen na 1975 weg. De heroriëntatie op een werkelijkheid waar de desillusies zich snel opstapelden, leverde nog niet direct een geprononceerde nieuwe literaire generatie op. Onder het militaire regime, en zeker na de decembermoorden, zwegen velen. Vanaf circa 1987 bloeide het literaire leven weer op, allereerst met de bundel "Getuige à decharge" van Orlando Emanuels. In het uitgeverijwezen werden enkele nieuwe initiatieven ontplooid, al bleef de kleine afzetmarkt voor boeken een obstakel. De literaire kritiek werd een vast Filedeel van het literaire circuit, vooral door toedoen van de sinds 1986 bestaande Literaire Pagina van het dagblad "De Ware Tijd". In de toneelwereld ging het creoolse volkstoneel een bloei als nooit tevoren tegemoet. Maar theatermakers die artistiek hoge eisen stellen, kwamen niet toe aan een continue productie, al zorgden Henk Tjon en Sharda Ganga voor enige beweging. Schrijvend Suriname verenigde zich in de Schrijversgroep '77. Er kwam een Literatuurprijs van Suriname die viermaal werd uitgereikt, telkens aan een dichter. De jeugdliteratuur ontwikkelde zich stormachtig met werk van onder meer Effendi Ketwaru (junior). Ismene Krishnadath ontving de eerste Staatsprijs voor Jeugdliteratuur. De Rahmān Khān-prijs werd eenmalig uitgereikt aan Jit Narain en Michiel van Kempen.
Het Surinaams-Nederlands bleef de belangrijkste taal voor prozaboeken. Rappa betoonde zich een virtuoos gebruiker van een 'sappige' vorm van Surinaams-Nederlands dat aansloeg bij een jeugdig publiek. Veel dichters schreven in het Sranan, maar door toedoen van Jit Narain maakt het Sarnami de opzienbarendste ontwikkeling door, met poëzie van onder meer Chitra Gajadin en proza van Rabin Baldewsingh. Aanvankelijk vooral gebruikt door migrantenschrijvers, kreeg het Sarnami gaandeweg literaire erkenning in Suriname (Cándani). Ook in andere volkstalen verschenen literaire uitgaven: in het Surinaams-Javaans en in sommige inheemse en marrontalen (zo schreef André Pakosie in het Ndyuka). Maar de volkstalen gaven - met uitzondering van het Sranan, waarin bijvoorbeeld Ané Doorson en Celestine Raalte opmerkelijke resultaten boekten - eerst en vooral uitdrukking aan het groepsbeleven; een groot publiek werd er niet mee gehaald.
Veel prozaschrijvers zochten hun heil in Nederland. Edgar Cairo en Astrid Roemer bouwden er een oeuvre op. Naar omvang en artistieke eigenzinnigheid bleven de meeste latere auteurs in hun schaduw, al bereikten Hugo Pos met zijn verhalen en vooral Anil Ramdas met zijn essays en journalistieke stukken landelijke bekendheid.
Enkele schrijvers van historische romans in populaire stijl wisten in de jaren '90 grote groepen nieuwe lezers te bereiken; de actiefste auteur binnen dit genre was Cynthia Mc Leod.
2000-heden.
Veel activiteit werd er ontplooid op het gebied van de jeugdliteratuur, met opmerkelijk werk van onder meer de al genoemde Ismene Krishnadath en verder Marijke van Mil en Marylin Simons. De laatste kwam ook met korte verhalen in "Carrousel" (2003). Zij was daarmee een van de velen die het vrouwelijke schrijven een grotere Schwung hebben gegeven. Vrouwen werden veel belangrijker dan ooit eerder in de Surinaamse letteren: voorbeelden zijn Ellen Ombre, Annel de Noré, Rita Rahman, Mala Kishoendajal en Annette de Vries. Karin Amatmoekrim zorgde voor een bijzondere inbreng door een roman te schrijven die - voor het eerst - het Javaanse leven en de Surinaams-Javaanse emigratie naar Holland thematiseerde: "Wanneer wij samen zijn" (2006). Eerder schreef zij "Het knipperleven" (2004) en in 2009 verscheen "Titus" dat haar de eerste Black Magic Woman Literatuurprijs opleverde. Als een van de weinige mannelijke auteurs boekte Clark Accord veel succes met zijn roman "De koningin van Paramaribo" (1999).

Bankersmith, Texas

Bankersmith (also sometimes written as Banker Smith) is a ghost town in Kendall County, Texas, USA. The town was founded in 1913. It lies approximately halfway between Fredericksburg and Comfort, near the border of Gillespie County.
History and geography.
Bankersmith Train Station.
Bankersmith originated in 1913 as a train station along the San Antonio, Fredericksburg and Northern Railway which served nearby Grapetown, Texas, running between Fredericksburg and Comfort. The town and rail station drew its name of "Bankersmith" from Temple Doswell Smith, an important Fredericksburg bank president who financed the railroad. In the early 1940s, the railroad abandoned the line running through Bankersmith.
Old Route 9 / Old San Antonio Road.
Old Route 9 / Old San Antonio Road is the first paved road running north into Fredericksburg, that ran through Bankersmith after the founding of the Bankersmith Train Station.
However the much later U.S. Route 87 did not pass through Bankersmith, it later one became an important alternative route between Fredericksburg and Comfort.
Bankersmith Post Office.
During the 1920s, Bankersmith reached its peak population of approximately 50. The post office was sometimes listed as being in Kendall County and sometimes listed in Gillespie County, depending on the abode of the current Postmaster. It was surrounded by a small business district which served the train station. By the 1940s, the town was all but abandoned and the post office was gone—although some residents persisted into the 1960s.
The Old Tunnel of the San Antonio, Fredericksburg and Northern Railway.
As the town was located in the Texas Hill Country, it is near one of the few railroad tunnels in the state (the only railroad tunnel in Texas when it was constructed). The tunnel is 962 feet in length, took 6 months to dig, and cost $134,000 at the time. The tunnel is now part of Old Tunnel State Park and the home to thousands of bats. The Old Tunnel State Park provides an extensive amount of parking area for would be visitors, it is at the intersection of Old San Antonio Road and Alamo Road. Meanwhile the southern end of the tunnel resides at 30°6'2"N and 98°49'15"W.
Plans for Bikini, Texas.
In 2012, restauranteur Doug Guller was said in the news to have purchased parts of the town on Craigslist, saying that he would rename the town to "Bikinis, Texas" after "Bikinis Sports Bar & Grill", his chain of breastaurants. The identity of the seller and the purchase price are not known, also some have questioned Guller's ability to rename a town that no longer officially exists.
Guller declared his intentions to turn the town into a tourist destination by creating a hall of fame for the Bikini swimsuit, presenting its history beginning with its invention in 1946. Guller has said he had no plans to open a Bikinis Sports Bar & Grill restaurant at the location, but might start a bar inside an abandoned bus there. The bus resides at 30°8'24"N and 98°49'8"W.

Shāh Khalīlullāh III

Shāh Khalīlullāh III (1740-1817, Persian شاه خليل الله) was the 45th Imam of the Nizari Ismaili Shia community. In 1792 he succeeded his father Abū-l-Ḥasan ‘Alī ibn Qāsim ‘Alī, for whom he was his eldest son. He moved the seat of the Imamate from Kirman to Kahak, Qom, from where he led for 20 years. His name of Shah Khalil Allah was a Ni'matullāhī Sufi name, which reflected the close relationship between the Nizaris and Ni'matullāhīs. In 1815 Shāh Khalīlullāh moved to Yazd in order to be closer to his Indian followers.
Death and succession.
Shāh Khalīlullāh died at the age of 77 in 1817 (along with several followers) as a result of a fanatical Twelver Shia cleric called Mulla Husayn Yazdi inciting a Twelver mob to attack the Imam's house as a follow up to a dispute between some Nizaris and some Twelver shopkeepers. However, Yazdi’s real aim may have been to weaken the spreading influence of the Nizaris. The Imam's house was also plundered in the attack. Mulla Husayn Yazdi was punished for his actions by Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar (the second Qajar king of Iran), since the king and the Imam had been on good terms.
The Imam was buried in the holy city of Najaf, Iraq, in a mausoleum that also contains the bodies of some of his relatives and descendants. The Imam was the last to have spent his entire Imamate in Persia. He was succeeded by his eldest son Shāh Ḥassan ‘Alī, who was the first Nizari Imam to use the title Aga Khan- a trend which has continued since to the present day. 
Following the Imams death, the Ismailis of Iran were in a strong enough position to finally come out publicly and cease their use of Taqiyya, which had been in force for over 500 years.
Western views.
Scottish traveller and author James Baillie Fraser described the Imam as “a person of high respectability and great influence”, while French linguist and orientalist Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy quoted a description of the Imam as “This person, whom his people grace with the pompous title of caliph, enjoys a great reputation and is considered to have the gift of performing miracles”.

German submarine U-231

German submarine "U-231" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II.
The submarine was laid down on 30 January 1942 at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft yard at Kiel as 'werk' 661, launched on 1 October, and commissioned on 14 November under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Wolfgang Wenzel.
After training with the 5th U-boat Flotilla at Kiel, "U-231" was transferred to the 3rd U-boat Flotilla on 1 May 1943 which was based at La Pallice in France, for front-line service. In three war patrols, the U-boat sank or damaged no merchant ships. She was a member of 11 wolf packs.
"U-231" was sunk on 13 January 1944 in the North Atlantic northeast of the Azores by a British aircraft.
Operational career.
1st patrol.
"U-231" departed Kiel on 13 April 1943. On the 22nd, she was attacked on two occasions by Catalina aircraft of No. 190 Squadron RAF. Both attacks caused no damage, although a man was lost overboard during the first. She was then attacked on the 23rd (twice), the first of which resulted in a flooded conning tower. She was also attacked on 21 May by American Avenger aircraft from the carrier USS "Bogue". The result was a chlorine gas leak and both radio transmitters being knocked out.
The boat reached La Pallice in occupied France on 31 May.
2nd patrol.
This foray commenced from Bordeaux, took her to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and terminated in La Pallice.
3rd patrol and loss.
"U-231" was sunk northeast of the Azores by depth charges from a Vickers Wellington of 172 Squadron on 13 January 1944. Seven men died, there were 47 survivors.

John Clark Milne

John Clark Milne (1897-1962) was a Scottish poet who wrote in the Doric dialect of the Scots language.
He was also a teacher and educationalist.
Some of his poetry was written for children.
Life.
John Milne was born at Memsie, near Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire in 1897 to a farming family.
He attended the University of Aberdeen where he excelled academically, then became a teacher. 
In later years he was Master of Method at Aberdeen College of Education. 
His collection of verses, "The Orra Loon" was published in 1946 and his collected "Poems" in 1963.
The northeastern poet and novelist Nan Shepherd helped prepare the latter edition of Milne's poetry, published after his death.
In 2009 the Buchan Heritage Society launched a CD on which well-known local performers and artists had collaborated in recording samples of his work. The society hoped that through hearing Milne's unique poetry children would help preserve the Doric tongue, which many in the area have forgotten.
Work.
According to Cuthbert Graham, "The imaginative literature of Aberdeen for the past century has been dominated by a single theme–a single myth if you like in the deep psychological sense–a passion for the land... In poetry Charles Murray, John C. Milne and Flora Garry have illuminated the same obsessive concern."
J.C. Milne's work was full of humorous irony, through which he could express his unique viewpoint while apparently reporting the speech of the characters he depicted.
Milne had an extraordinary ability to exploit the potential for rhyming in the dialect.
Rich in vocabulary, his poetry seemed simple and unaffected.

Broken Home (Body of Proof)

"Broken Home" is the ninth and final episode of the first season of the American medical drama "Body of Proof". It was originally broadcast in the United States on ABC on 17 May 2011. The episode was directed by Nelson McCormick and written by Andrew Dettman.
In this episode, Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) stops the funeral of Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) after seeing irregularities in her death. Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry), and siblings Sara (Jo Armeniox) and Bill (Eric Sheffer Stevens), all say that Nikki was suicidal, with evidence at the scene suggesting this, but when Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) do an autopsy, the evidence suggests otherwise. Meanwhile, Megan finds out from daughter Lacey (Mary Mouser) that her ex-husband Todd (Jeffrey Nordling) is in a relationship with her boss Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan).
The episode received mixed to positive reviews, and was watched by 10.33 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, on the Sunday night it aired in the United States. Christine Orlando of "TV Fanatic" was unsure whether the episode was good enough to be the season finale, however she did praise this "solid" episode, saying it had an "intriguing murder, lots of suspects, and an interesting personal twist for Megan". This episode was nominated at the 21st Annual Environmental Media Awards, however lost out to the "" episode "Fracked".
Plot.
Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) are called to Lacey's (Mary Mouser) school when she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who is dead, after battling a terminal illness. When Megan looks at the photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they can look at her body, much to the horror of Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting sympathy from friends; however Lillian did not kill her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually cheating on her with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will she was giving all her money to a fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money.
The two are arrested, and Nikki's funeral takes place. However, Samantha arrives to arrest Lillian, as Nikki's brother Bill (Eric Sheffer Stevens) found the pills Lillian was giving Nikki, and Lillian is charged with interfering with her daughter’s medical care. Bill assures Megan that Nikki's money in her will, will be put to a good use and thanks her and the team for investigating. Throughout the investigation Lacey thinks that Megan and Todd are getting back together, as Todd has made many calls to Megan's work. Lacey is shocked to find out that Todd is not phoning Megan, but Kate, and the two are in a relationship. Megan is angry at Kate, but tells Lacey to respect her, even if she does not like her.
Production.
"Broken Home" was written by Andrew Dettman and directed by Nelson McCormick, this being his third episode he directed, having directed the season premiere "Pilot" and the subsequent episode "Letting Go". McCormick has directed many television series such as "Third Watch", "Nip/Tuck", "ER" and more recently, "Criminal Minds". Daniel Licht, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for the episode. Actress Jill Eikenberry – best known for her role in "L.A. Law" – and actor Eric Sheffer Stevens – best known for his role in "As The World Turns" – both guest starred in this episode, as Lillian and Bill Parkson, respectively. Sheffer Stevens later reprised his role as Bill in season two's fifth episode "Point of Origin". Recurring cast members Jeffrey Nordling and Mary Mouser returned in this episode, with this being both Mouser's and Nordling's first appearance since seasons one's seventh episode, "All in the Family". Regular cast member John Carroll Lynch who plays Detective Bud Morris, did not appear in this episode, although he was credited.
"Broken Home", along with the eight episodes from "Body of Proof"s first season, were released on a two-disc DVD set in the United States on September 20, 2011. The sets included brief audio commentaries from various crew and cast members for several episode's, a preview of season 2 and a 10-minute "featurette" on the making of the show, with commentaries from the medical consultants who helped with the script, as well as a "Contaminated Evidence" blooper reel.
Reception.
Ratings.
In its original American broadcast on May 17, 2011, "Broken Home" was seen by 10.33 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings. Among viewers between ages 18 and 49, it received a 2.1 rating/9 share. This means that it was seen by 2.1 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This episode achieved a much higher number of viewers than the previous episode, "Buried Secrets", and a significant higher number than subsequent episode "Love Thy Neighbor", which is season two's premiere. "Body of Proof" came fifth in the ratings on Tuesday night, being outperformed by the season finales of CBS's "NCIS" and of "The Good Wife" as well as two airings of ABC's "Dancing with the Stars". "Broken Home" was watched by 1.75 million viewers upon its airing on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
Critical response.
This episode received mixed to positive reviews. Christine Orlando of "TV Fanatic" said that the plot of the episode had a "nice story arc when the cause of death ranged from disease, to suicide, and finally murder". She added that Nikki's family was a "nightmare". She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he "came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've never seen such a procedure portrayed with that level of specificity". Orlando carried on saying, "Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping for more of that by the end of the season". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it "justified", saying it was a "odd position to be in", but summarized; "she'll just have to get over it". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; "the jury is still out on Todd". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a "great bonding moment" between Megan and Lacey, saying she "liked" that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, "I like it when adults actually act like adults".
This episode was nominated at the 21st Annual Environmental Media Awards, an "organization dedicated to harnessing the power of the entertainment industry and the media to educate the global public on environmental issues and motivate sustainable lifestyles". Under the category "Television Episodic Drama", "Broken Home" was nominated alongside the "The Good Wife" episode "Real Deal" and the winner, the "" episode "Fracked".

Martin Levan

Martin Levan is a music producer and sound engineer who, during the 1980s and 1990s, designed the sound for many of the major musicals in the West End of London.
Early career.
Levan began his career as the tea boy at Morgan Studios, London in 1971, rising to become an engineer and producer. His album credits include John Martyn's "Grace and Danger", Ralph McTell's "Water of Dreams", Iron Maiden's eponymous album, Neil Ardley's "Kaleidoscope of Rainbows" and "Harmony of the Spheres", Collosseum II's "Wardance", Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Variations" and "Requiem", Gary Boyle's "The Dancer" and "Electric Glide" and Barbara Thompson's "Paraphernalia".
Sound Design.
Levan's career developed in a different direction when, in 1982, Andrew Lloyd Webber contracted him to supervise the sound design for the original production of the musical "Song and Dance" at the Palace Theatre, London. He also produced a live recording of the first night performance. The impact of the sound production for the show led to him designing the sound for a number of musicals throughout the world over the next two decades. With Lloyd Webber, he worked on the original 1984 London production and 1987 Broadway production of "Starlight Express", the 1985 Broadway production of "Song and Dance", the 1986 London and 1988 Broadway production of "The Phantom of the Opera", the original 1989 London production of "Aspects of Love", the 1991 revival of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" at the London Palladium, the original 1993 London production and 1994 Broadway production of "Sunset Boulevard", the original 1998 London production of "Whistle Down the Wind", the original 2000 London production of "The Beautiful Game" and international productions of "Cats". His other credits include "Little Shop of Horrors", "Kiss of the Spider Woman", "Blondel", "Carrie", "The Baker's Wife", "Show Boat" and "Lautrec".
In 1988, he developed the 'A-B System' to combat problems associated with the conventional method of combining multiple radio microphones systems on stage. Phase related interference patterns resulting in coloration and distortion in the sound system had hitherto been unavoidable but the use of the 'A-B System' effectively eliminated this phenomenon providing the audience with a much more natural, clearer and more focussed sound.
Awards.
His original Broadway cast recording of "Cats" won a Grammy Award. Other awards include a NAACP Theatre Award for Best Sound Director for "The Phantom of the Opera", a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Sound Design for "Sunset Boulevard" and a Jessie Richardson Theatre Award for Outstanding Design Team Achievement for "Show Boat".
Return to the Recording Studio.
In 1998, Martin conceived and built the Red Kite Studio music recording facility in Carmarthenshire, Wales. He continues to produce and record there.
During 2010, he worked with Leeds-based guitarist and vocalist Tristan Mackay on some demo recordings before collaborating on his debut album "Out Along the Wire" which was released in February 2012, reaching No.1 on the iTunes Blues chart.
Personal.
Martin and his wife Karen live in Wales. They have three children: Remy, Toby and Kim.

2008–09 Dynamo Dresden season

The 2008–09 season saw Dynamo Dresden return to national football, in the inaugural season of the 3. Liga. A new coach was appointed, veteran Eduard Geyer was replaced by Ruud Kaiser, a Dutchman with a good record in youth football. The squad saw many changes too, with several experienced players leaving or retiring and a number of new players brought on.
Dynamo had the honour of playing the first match in 3. Liga history - a 1–0 win over Rot-Weiss Erfurt, with debutant Halil Savran scoring the new competition's first goal. Despite this, though, it was a largely disappointing season for the club - they spent much of the season in the bottom half of the table, before relatively decent end to the season saw them finish in 10th place.
Dynamo's reserve team had a very successful season. Coach by Dynamo's former Bundesliga player Matthias Maucksch, they won the Landesliga Sachsen (and promotion to the NOFV-Oberliga Süd and the Saxony Cup, a competition which the first-team were eliminated from in the first round.

Barcelona International Centre of Photography

The Barcelona International Centre of Photography (El "Centre Internacional de Fotografia Barcelona", in Catalan language, CIFB) was a singular initiative in the photographic culture of Spain in the second half of the 1970s, becoming a pioneering institution in the formation, study, exhibition, distribution and production of the photographic image. 
The professional career of its initiator, Albert Guspi (1943-1985), an important innovator and central figure within the new photographic scene of the seventies, culminated in the creation of the CIFB. Despite its brief five-year existence, the CIFB became a reference in the reformation of photographic culture during the Spanish transition to democracy. 
History.
In the heart of the Raval, at Carrer Aurora 11 bis, we can still find the building that once housed the Centre Internacional de Fotografia Barcelona, CIFB. On its façade, an icon of the renovation of the neighbourhood, we can still see the paintings by Arranz Bravo and Bartolozzi, restored in 1997. 
The CIFB was a short-lived experiment in the process of institutionalisation of photographic culture during Spain's democratic Transition. The current study of this experiment, little known and almost forgotten despite its nearness in time and space, should be understood from a double perspective: local and global. On the one hand, this is a local study of a process that was taking place at an international level during the seventies: the re-composition of the cultural field within the new cultural industries following a post-industrial economic model. This was a moment of great expansion for the art market, with photography becoming part of it to an unprecedented degree. The seventies marked the beginning of a great international resurgence of institutions, festivals, academic programmes, galleries and publications that laid down the conditions for the interpenetration of culture and economy as it is known today. On the other hand, this is a study of how such generalised historical conditions took on a specific, local and very concrete form in the field of photography in Barcelona during the Transition. In this sense, the study sheds a different light on the period, allowing us to understand how disparate photographic practices and traditions, which have since become separate, were able to coexist at the time. The multiplicity of the seventies eventually lost ground when faced with a visualist conception of creative photography, whose hegemony began to establish itself after the Jornades Catalanes de Fotografia, which took place at the Fundació Joan Miró in 1980, and which, in retrospect, are still regarded as photography's official entry into the new cultural policies. The CIFB declined to take part in the Jornades.

The most voted for candidate from the most voted for lema would win the presidential election. The law would also reorganise the Senate.
The second set of reforms were put forward by the General Assembly on 24 February 1938. They would restrict each lema to a single candidate for president, as well as reorganising local government. As this was an administrative initiative by two-fifths of the Assembly, a majority of registered voters voting in favour was required. This was achieved, with 52.47% of all registered voters approving the reforms.

Hickory Ridge Landfill

The Hickory Ridge Landfill is a municipal solid waste landfill located in Conley, Georgia, United States and privately owned by Republic Services. The site was opened in 1993 and closed in 2006; it contains nearly 9,000,000 cubic yards of waste.
The Hickory Ridge Landfill was formerly capped in October 2011 with an innovative patent-pending, dual-purpose landfill closure system referred to as an Exposed Geomembrane Solar Cover (EGSC). Developed by Carlisle Energy Services, a division of Carlisle Construction Materials, the closure system, branded the Spectro PowerCap(R), provides both long-term environmental benefits with integrated solar cells (photovoltaics) that generate clean, renewable electricity.
The project is the second installation of an EGSC and is the world's largest installed system of its kind. At the time of commissioning it was the largest solar photovoltaic system in the state of Georgia. It also represents a $5,000,000 investment by Republic Services supported by a $2,000,000 grant from the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA).
System Details.
The innovative landfill closure system features a Dark Ivy green, 60-mil scrim reinforced TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin) geomembrane cover over 48 acres in total. Within this area, an integrated one-megawatt (MWp) photovoltaic array is located on the southwest and southeast slopes of the landfill in an area approximately ten acres.
The one-megawatt solar array features over 7,000 flexible solar laminates manufactured by UNI-SOLAR(R), a division of Energy Conversion Devices. UNI-SOLAR's photovoltaic laminates were shipped to Carlisle's manufacturing facility in Senatobia, MS where 36 laminates were factory bonded at a time to 12' wide by 120' long TPO geomembrane panels and finished with wire harnesses and a patent-pending low profile rain flap. The panels were subsequently packaged in rolls and shipped to the site prior to construction. Each photovoltaic/geomembrane roll was rated at 5,184 Wp DC.
During construction the photovoltaic/geomembrane rolls were unrolled and heat-welded to like panels of TPO geomembrane to create a monolithic cover over the entire landfill. The geomembrane is placed directly over a 16 ounce Geotextile that is placed directly over the final grade. The cover system is secured via horizontal and vertical anchor trenches designed by HDR Inc.
The closure system meets infiltration and erosion criteria as prescribed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Title 40, Part 258, Subpart F for municipal solid waste landfill closure systems while also capturing the methane gas that is generated by the landfill, turning it into energy in a separate operation. The Georgia Environmental Protection Division approved the landfill closure system as a "Final" closure system.
The photovoltaic system is actually composed of four separate arrays located on the 3H:1V slopes on the southeast and southwest areas of the landfill. Each photovoltaic array is rated for approximately 250kWp DC each; each with a 260kWp DC inverter. The system also features a patent-pending low-profile wire trace used for carrying the conductors from the photovoltaic laminates to the combiner boxes prior to connecting the inverters.
The site is approximately seven miles southeast of downtown Atlanta, Georgia and can be seen during landing approach (west to east direction) into Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport.
The system is wholesale interconnected with electricity being sold directly to Georgia Power. The photovoltaic array is expected to generate 1,300,000 kWh in its first year of production. The electricity generated from the system is equivalent to powering 224 homes while reducing over 1,102 tons of CO2 annually.
Real-time energy production can be viewed via the online remote monitoring system.
Key Project Partners.
The following companies helped to develop, engineer and construct the system:
Awards.
HDR Inc. received the following awards for their engineering work on this project:
American Environmental Group (AEG) received the 2013 Award of Excellence from the International Association of Geosynthetic Installers (IAGI) for their work as the geomembrane installer for the project

St Mary and St Michael's Church, Great Urswick

St Mary and St Michael's Church, Great Urswick, is located in the village of Great Urswick, Cumbria, England. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Furness, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Cuthbert, Aldingham, St Matthew, Dendron, and St Michael, Rampside. These churches are part of a group known as the Low Furness Group of Parishes. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.
History.
There is evidence that a church existed on the site before the Norman conquest, but the earliest parts of the present church are found in the lower part of the tower and in the chancel and date from the 13th century. The chancel was lengthened in the 14th century, and the nave and north vestry date from this period. The tower was also heightened around this time, and the interior of the roof is dated 1598. A west gallery was installed in 1828. Plaster was stripped from the internal walls in 1911. In 2011 the church was restored, and a new heating system installed.
Architecture.
Exterior.
The church is constructed in stone rubble with ashlar dressings and a slate roof. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with a south porch, a chancel with a north vestry, and a west tower. The tower is as wide as the nave, and has a west doorway with a pointed arch. Above the doorway is a three-light window with Perpendicular tracery and a niche containing a sculpture of the "Pietà". The three-light bell openings have louvres and straight heads. At the top of the tower is an embattled parapet. The walls of the tower are very thick, and contain a stairway inside the north wall. On the south side of the nave is a gabled porch with a round-headed doorway, over which is a quatrefoil. To the right of the porch are two-light Decorated windows, and a two-light mullioned window. On the north side are two-light straight-headed windows. The east window of the chancel has three lights. On the south side of the chancel are a lancet window, and a two-light Decorated window, and on the north side is a two-light Perpendicular window. The vestry has two-light windows on the east and west sides.
Interior.
Inside the church is a west gallery carried on pairs of Doric columns. Many of the fittings were carved by Alec Miller in the 1910s. The choir stalls and the organ case are carved with angels playing a variety of instruments. On the vestry door is a carving of the Annunciation. The rood screen has depictions of saints, and carries a plain cross. The reredos includes a painting by James Cranke, and is flanked by carved figures of Virgin Mary and Saint Michael. The three-decker pulpit dates from the 18th century, and has a tester of 1912, which consists of a scallop carried by putti. The pews are decorated with roses and scallops. A larger pew, known as the Gale Pew, has carvings of putti and flowers. The font is medieval, and is in the shape of a large egg-cup. Its cover dates from 1921, and is carved with various items linked to the sea. Two of the windows on the south side of the chancel contain fragments of medieval stained glass. In the south wall of the nave is a window known as the "Maiden's window", which was made in 1912–13, and a window of 1931 depicting "Doubting Thomas", made by Powells. Also in the church is a 13th-century coffin lid inscribed with a foliated cross, and memorial wall tablets dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. The two-manual pipe organ is located on the north side of the chancel, and was built by Wilkinson of Kendal in about 1910. There is a ring of four bells, the oldest of which dates from about 1460. The next was cast in 1711 by Abraham Rudhall II of Gloucester. The other bells were both cast by John Taylor and Company of Loughborough, one in 1907. and the other in 1955.
Carved stones.
When the plaster was stripped from the internal walls in 1911, an ancient carved stone was found incorporated in the wall. It is known as the Tunwinni Cross, and is carved with a panel containing runes, below which are two figures. The stone was dated by the antiquarian W. G. Collingwood to the 9th century. In 1909 another stone had been found, this one being a fragment of the cross-shaft dating possibly from the 10th century.
External features.
In the churchyard are two structures that are listed at Grade II. To the south of the church is a monument to the Gale family with dates between 1816 and 1903. It consists of a sarcophagus with an urn finial, in a square enclosure surrounded by railings. Nearer the church is a sundial dated 1729. This consists of an inscribed square pier on a four-stepped base, with a round plate and gnomon.

Sedric Webber

Sedric Webber (born January 5, 1977), sometimes misspelled as Cedric Webber, is an American retired professional basketball player. He played the small forward position for a career that spanned between 1999 and 2006 in which he played in numerous countries and leagues. Webber was also a standout college player for the College of Charleston (CofC) between 1995 and 1999.
College.
Webber played for the CofC Cougars under head coach John Kresse between 1995–96 and 1998–99. During his four-year career he scored 1,267 points and 694 rebounds. As a junior in 1997–98 he was named the Trans-America Athletic Conference (TAAC) Co-Player of the Year after averaging 15.1 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. The TAAC changed its name in 2001 to the Atlantic Sun Conference.
During the summer after his junior year, Webber was ticketed for trespassing and disorderly conduct when he was playing pick-up basketball in CofC's arena, then refused to leave the premises. His defense attorney proved that they were let in and authorized to play, and the charges were thrown out by a judge. Also between his junior and senior years, the College of Charleston switched athletic conferences and became members of the Southern Conference beginning in the 1998–99 school year.
As a senior, Webber claimed his second straight conference player of the year award after leading the Cougars to their second consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance. He averaged 13.8 points, 7.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game, all of which led CofC. By winning back-to-back player of the year awards, and due to CofC's conference switch, Webber joined Granger Hall as the second Division I men's basketball player to have won conference player of the year in two different Division I conferences (in 2013–14, Creighton's Doug McDermott became the third).
Professional.
Webber did not get selected in the 1999 NBA Draft. His professional career thus began in the United States Basketball League for the Kansas Cagerz. Over the next seven seasons, Webber was somewhat of a journeyman, spending time in various leagues in the United States as well as Australia, the Philippines, Sweden, and Venezuela. His greatest success came while playing in the NBA Development League. Between 2001–02 and 2003–04, while playing for the North Charleston Lowgators and Columbus Riverdragons, Webber was twice named to the All-NBA Development League Team (2002, 2003). In each of those seasons he finished in the top five in scoring. For the 2002–03 season, he finished fifth in field goal attempts and sixth in total field goals, fifth in free throw attempts, third in total steals and steals per game, fifth in minutes per game, ninth in points per game and fifth in total points, third in minutes played, sixth in total offensive rebounds, tenth in total assists, and was the overall number one player with 50 total games played. He was considered the Lowgators' "go-to guy" that season, according to head coach Doug Marty. In 2003–04, Webber earned the NBDL Player of the Month Award for March 2004.
Webber's professional career ended in 2006 after playing for his final club, the Sydney Kings in Australia's National Basketball League.

Starters (novel)

Starters is a novel by Lissa Price. The book was published on March 12, 2012 by Delacorte Press and has been published in German, Greek, Dutch, Italian, French and Portuguese. Price has announced a sequel to the book entitled "Enders", with screen rights to the series currently being shopped. Price stated that she came up with the idea for the novel after trying to receive flu shot and was turned away due to a lack of available vaccines. 
Plot.
"Starters" takes place in a futuristic Los Angeles, where wars are waged with biological weapons that have killed anyone not vaccinated against them. The only ones that survive the attack are either under 20 or over 60 years of age. The term "Starters" refers to those under the age of 20, while "Enders" is used to describe the survivors over the age of 60. Because many of the Starters were unable to work, the aftermath leaves many of them starving and desperate due to not having funds to afford necessities. A result of this is that many Starters willingly allow Enders to temporarily inhabit their bodies via a neurochip implanted by the Body Bank. Sixteen-year-old Callie was one such Starter, but is startled to awaken in the mansion of a rich Ender after her neurochip malfunctions. Callie initially relishes the chance to live out a lavish lifestyle where she wants for nothing and is dating the grandson of a Senator, but soon discovers that her renter has dark and dangerous plans that Callie wants no part of.
Reception.
Reception for "Starters" has been positive, with the Los Angeles Times calling it "well executed". Publishers Weekly also praised the book, but criticized the audiobook narrator's voices for the female characters as "melodramatic".

German submarine "U-232" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II.
The submarine was laid down on 17 January 1942 at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft yard at Kiel as 'werk' 662, launched on 15 October and commissioned on 28 November under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Ernst Ziehm.
After training with the 5th U-boat Flotilla at Kiel, "U-232" was transferred to the 9th U-boat Flotilla in Brest on 1 May 1943, for front-line service. In one war patrol, the U-boat sank or damaged no merchant ships. She was a member of three wolf packs.
"U-232" was sunk in July 1943 in the North Atlantic by an American aircraft.
Operational career.
Patrol and loss.
"U-232"s inaugural patrol took her from Kiel to the Atlantic Ocean via the gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. While heading for the Bay of Biscay, she was attacked and sunk by an American USAAF Liberator on 8 July 1943. Forty-six men died; there were no survivors.

Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible

The Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible (Лицевой летописный свод, the last volume is also known as the King-Book) is the largest compilation of historical information ever assembled in medieval Russia. It covers the period from the creation of the world to the year 1567.
The set of manuscripts was commissioned by Ivan the Terrible specifically for his royal library. The literal meaning of the Russian title is "face chronicle," alluding to the numerous hand-painted miniatures. The compilation consists of 10 volumes, containing about 10 thousand sheets of rag paper. It is illustrated with more than 16 thousand miniatures.
Volumes.
The volumes are grouped in a relatively chronological order and include four major areas: Biblical History, History of Rome, History of Byzantium and Russian history. The titles and contents of the 10 volumes are:
History.
The manuscript is thought to have been created between 1568 and 1576. The work seems to have been started as early as the 1540s. It was commissioned by Ivan the Terrible for the royal library for the purposes of educating his children. The tsar's friend Aleksey Adashev was involved in the creation of the work.

Esperanza de Saráchaga

Princess Doña Esperanza Felicitas Alexandra de Saráchaga Lobanova Rostovskaya, Marquess and Countess de Sarachaga-Lobanova-Rostovskaya, Baroness Truchseß von Wetzhausen, Baroness de Saráchaga, Baroness de Uría, Baroness de Echevarría, Baroness de Azpíroz, Baroness de Urrutia, Baroness de Mendíbil, Baroness de Torre de Arbieto, Baroness de Torre de Zubialdea. Also known as "La Madame Baroness Truschess von Wetzhausen" and "Doña Esperanza de Saráchaga y Lobanov de Rostov".
Background.
Doña Esperanza was born July 7, 1839 in St. Petersburg, Russia. Known in Russian as “Spera”, she was the eldest daughter of nobleman
and diplomat Don Jorge de Saráchaga y Uría-Nafarrondo, and his Russian wife Princess Ekaterina Lobanov-Rostovskaya.
Don Jorge was Marquis and Comte de Saráchaga, XVII Lord of Saráchaga, and head of the ancient dynastic "Noble and Illustrious House de Saráchaga de Bilbao", while Ekaterina was daughter of the Russian statesman of the Russian Imperial House of
Lobanov-Rostov, Prince Alexei Lobanov Rostov, and his wife Countess Rucheleff.
House de Saráchaga.
Paternally, Dona Esperanza was the co-heir and the Head of the House of the ancient dynastic "Noble and Illustrious House de Saráchaga" of the Basque region of northern Spain. The head of the house was split with her brother Don Alexis until reverting solely to Esperanza upon the very public morganatic marriage of Alexis to a member of his household staff, Mademoiselle Eugenie Marie Champion in 1903., The Cadet branch and second in line to succeed to the senior line was the Sarachaga MacMahon line which united with the de Sarachaga-Lobanov Rostovsky in the 1800's and the current Head of the House de Sarachaga is from this unification.
Origins
The de Saráchagas derive from powerful semi-Sovereign feudal Senores and ricohombres. Often awarded with Grandeeships. They were intimately involved in the swearing and coronation of numerous monarchs. Including Don Íñigo Ortiz de Saráchaga, present in the Assembly at 1476 at the oath of King Ferdinand. In 1527, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who was also Charles I of Spain, recognized the family's noble status but their nobility dates back to at the earliest 890’s A.D. in the Basque region of northern Spain. They are descendants of the Ancient noble House de Ortiz de Saracho, of Burgos as seen in their arms. Others, have theorized that they may have originated even earlier.
Doña Esperanza's grandfather lost his life in the guerrilla struggle of the Peninsular War during the Napoleonic Wars. Her grandmother then took shelter with a French general who was originally from Baden and sent the children out of Spain to Karlsruhe to better ensure their safety. After the war, the general married the widow and the children received their education in Baden.
Don Jorge entered military service and was as elegant and handsome officer a well-known personality in Karlsruhe.
The family's noble status was recognized in Spain, France, Bulgaria, Italy, Poland, Russia, Mexico, England, Belgium, and Germany, which allowed the family to marry into many ruling and former ruling European families as equals.
House of Lobanov-Rostovsky.
Esperanza’s mother was Princess Ekaterina Lobanov-Rostovskaya (b. 1847?), a maid in honor in 1833 to the Empress of Russia (Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)) and the eldest daughter of Russian statesman and Prince Aleksey Alexandrovich Lobanov-Rostovsky and his wife Countess Rucheleff/Countess Kusheleva, Alexandra Grigorievna. Ekatarina was granddaughter of Princess Ekaterina Alexandrovna Lobanova-Rostovskaya, born Princess
Kurakina (1735–1802), wife of Prince Ivan Ivanovich Lobanov-Rostovsky.
Childhood.
Doña Esperanza’s father and mother met in St. Petersburg while Don Jorge was posted there as a diplomat where he became close to the Tzar. Jorge requested permission to marry and the Emperor of Russia, Nicholas I, personally wrote "agree" in
pencil dated June 5, 1837.
Esperanza would later write that her childhood was good because she had so many people around her who loved her, but that it was also very sad because by the time she was almost ten years old she had lost both her parents and her grandfather. When Esperanza was six years old, she and her brother succeeded to her father’s massive fortune and titles upon his untimely death in a duel in 1845, just as his father before him, Don Florencio de Saráchaga e Izarduy, had also died prematurely in a duel. The duel surrounded tensions regarding Jewish banker Louis Haber and Napoleon's adopted daughter, Grand Duchess Stéphanie of Baden (born Beauharnais-Leuchtenberg).
After his death, their bereaved mother was unable to care for them and went to stay with her dearest friend Marie Thérèse of France,
Dowager Empress of France. Soon after, she died in MacDonald Palace. Upon their mother's departure, Doña Esperanza and her brother were
adopted by their maternal grandparents, Prince Alexei Alexandrovich Lobanov-Rostovsky and his wife Countess Kusheleva, Alexandra
Grigorievna. Upon their adoption they were awarded all privileges belonging to them as well as honors of now being the adopted children
of their grandfather, Prince Alexei Lobanov-Rostov. Doña Eperanza’s grandmother, Princess Lobanov-Rostov, died in Paris during the
French Revolution of 1848, and Esperanza was sent to be brought up as a Russian Princess in St. Petersburg away from her brother Alexis. She and her brother spent their childhood apart between Russia, France, Norway, and Spain.
Marriage.
Doña Esperanza married to diplomat and statesman Imperial Baron Friedrich Truchseß von Wetzhausen, First Minister of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. They were wed on 15 July 1862. Baron Friedrich was primogeniture and semi sovereign of Truchseß von Wetzhausen. 
Esperanza first met Friedrich when he was working as a diplomat in the Prussian and Russian court. It was love at first sight, and they were married soon after. During their marriage she often took him back to Bilbao, Spain to visit her family and as Senores oversee their administration of the Basque Country. Her sense of humor often
manifested itself in harmless games of trickery. Once, when they were newly-wed, she took her new husband on a long hiking trip in Spain
where they came upon a beautiful country palace. Her husband loved it and said that he wanted to know more about the owners because he was going to buy it for her. The gardener was the one to reveal to him that Esperanza was the owner all along.
Prince Philipp zu Eulenburg-Hertefeld commented that Esperanza was considered by her peers at age 44 to have beauty, be generous and a strong intelligence, and a generous nature,
The couple longed to have children but were unable to. In 1885 Doña Esperanza and her brother Don Alexis (Baron of Sarachagoff in Russian Empire since 1862) became guardians of their recently orphaned nephew and niece, Don Ricardo de Saráchaga, and Doña Gloria de Saráchaga. Don Ricardo was Baron de Saráchaga, Baron de Arribálzaga, Baron de Urrutia, Lord de MacMahon and all other family dignities from his father’s second marriage to Doña Elvira de Arribálzaga.
Esperanza’s nephew and adopted son, Ricardo de Saráchaga was named heir to the family titles and estates upon the deaths of Esperanza and
her brother. Ricardo’s descendants hold them to this day. Esperanza died in Cannes, France on January 28, 1914.
Charitable work.
Esperanza was described as very generous to those around her. She founded many institutions and foundations including a
Bavarian Kindergarten and "Friedrich's Home", a Bavarian elder care home named after her husband.
Diplomacy and politics.
Doña Esperanza was one of the wealthiest women in Europe during a time of great upheaval, especially in both Prussia and Spain. She was
confidante to King Ludwig II of Bavaria, Empress Victoria of Prussia, Queen Isabella II of Spain,
Empress of Russia Maria Alexandrovna, and the Empress Eugenia of France. This was sometimes
an awkward position to be in when many of her close friends led governments at war with each other. Esperanza skilfully moved through
their circles always trying to maintain balance. Her rank allowed her to introduce people into those courts such as at the Imperial Russian Court in the Winter Palace. She was also very loyal to friends. Philipp zu Eulenburg-Hertefeld relays that
Esperanza found out the plot to depose King Ludwig II of Bavaria and confronted the conspirators with an umbrella at the entrance to
Schloss Hohenschuangau, giving her enough time to alert the King and military.
Children.
Friedrich and Esperanza's adopted children were her niece and nephew, Doña Gloria and Don Ricardo.
Doña Ciriaca María de la Gloria Josefa de Saráchaga y Arribálzaga Countess de Sarachaga, born on the 8th of August 1878, married in Brussels on the 21st of January 1902 to Baron Maurice Greindl. The marriage was considered Morganatic by the de Sarachaga family and Gloria was stripped of all family titles and inheritance for her and her descendants.
Prince Don Ricardo Alfonso Mateo de Saráchaga y Arribálzaga Lobanov-Rostov, Marquis and Count de Sarachaga-Lobanov Rostovsky, Marquis de Planquet, Baron de Saráchaga, Baron de Arribálzaga, Baron de Urrutia, Lord de Mac-Mahon and possessor of all other honors and dignities of the family, was born on the 23rd of September, 1871 in Bilbao, Spain and died 1919 in exile from The Dictatorship of Spain, in Mexico in 1919 assassinated by poison.
He married in Bilbao to Vizcayan Senora Doña Maria Luisa de Carrouche, His children were Princess Doña Elvira de Saráchaga y Granados, Prince Don Enrique de Saráchaga y Granados, who drowned in a canal in Mexico City without descendants, and Prince Don Alfredo Alejo de Saráchaga-Lobanov Rostovsky, Marquis and Count de Sarachaga-Lobanov Rostovsky, Marquis de Planquette, Baron de Saráchaga, Baron de Arribálzaga, Baron de Urrutia, Lord de Mac-Mahon, who was also known as D. Alfredo de Saráchaga.
Don Alfredo succeeded his father and brother to all other honors and dignities of the family and married dynastically to heiress and
Mexican noblewoman Vizcondessa Doña Lidia Avellaneda, Senora de Solar de Tejada, a descendant of the Houses of Bourbon and Hurtado de Mendoza and House of Cortes. Alfredo was a diplomat and worked as CEO of Mexican oil company Pemex. Don Alfredo took up the important work of the de Sarachaga family and supported the Basque National Government in exile in Mexico with Santiago Aznar Sarachaga.
Don Alfredo's daughter was Princess Doña Ekatarina (Katia) García de León de Saráchaga, Marquess and Countess de Sarachaga.-Lobanov Rostovsky, Baroness de Saráchaga, Baroness de Arribálzaga, Baroness de Urrutia, Lady de Mac-Mahon, Senora de Tejada, and other honors and dignities of the family. She was born on the 14th of February, 1946 and married to Don Giuseppe di Ferrari of the noble Ferraris of Venice and Parma. She died young at 46 yrs. old.
Don Alfredo and his wife were then to leave the bulk of their fortune and Head of the House of the ancient dynastic Noble and Illustrious House de Saráchaga and family titles to their granddaughter, Doña Stephanie. She became Princess Doña Stephanie Zobel de Saráchaga, Marquess and Countess de Sarachaga-Lobanova Rostovsky, Marquessa de Planquette, Vizcondessa de Avellaneda, Baroness de Saráchaga, Baroness de Arribalzaga, Baroness de Urrutia, Lady de Mac-Mahon, Senora de Tejada. She married dynastically in 2010 to Baron Yacov Crawford Zobel heir to the Counts
of Bykovskŷ and Zeballos, and descendant of the Earls of Crawford of Scotland and England. Upon her
marriage, her grandfather Prince Alfredo Alejo de Saráchaga Lobanov-Rostovsky, stipulated in accordance to House law that all titles not able to be inherited by a woman to go to her spouse.

David L. Spector (born 6 December 1952, in New York City) is a cell and molecular biologist best recognized for his research on gene expression and nuclear dynamics. He is currently a professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and head of the Gene Regulation and Cell Proliferation program of the CSHL Cancer Center. Since 2007, he has also served as Director of Research of CSHL.
Education and faculty positions.
Spector received a Bachelor of Science degree from City College of New York in 1973, a Master's degree from Herbert H. Lehman College in 1977, and a Ph.D.in Cell Biology from Rutgers University in 1980. After completing his Ph.D. he accepted a position as Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. In 1985 he relocated to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and has been promoted through the ranks to his current position of Professor. In 2007 he was appointed Director of Research.
Professional activities.
Spector is a pioneer in unraveling our understanding of the inner workings of the cell nucleus. His early investigations centered on the unusual chromosome structure of dinoflagellates. Recent studies in his laboratory are focused on examining the organization and regulation of gene expression in living mammalian cells. His laboratory has developed and implemented innovative approaches to elucidate the spatial and temporal aspects of gene expression and in identifying and characterizing the function of nuclear retained long non-coding RNAs.
His most seminal research accomplishments include the direct visualization in living cells of the recruitment of factors involved in gene expression to active genes; the development of a biochemical fractionation approach to purify a sub-nuclear domain (nuclear speckles) and characterize its protein constituents; the development of a live cell imaging system to visualize a stably integrated genetic locus and follow in real-time, its mRNA and protein products in living cells; the elucidation of a rapid-response mechanism of regulating gene expression through RNA nuclear retention; identification of a mechanism by which a single genetic locus can produce a long nuclear retained non-coding RNA and a small cytoplasmic tRNA-like transcript, and the identification and characterization of a long nuclear retained non-coding RNA that is involved in organizing a sub-nuclear organelle (paraspeckles).
In addition, Spector has co-edited numerous microscopy techniques manuals (i.e. "Basic Methods in Microscopy", "Live Cell Imaging: A Laboratory Manual"), and a treatise of "The Nucleus", that are used in laboratories throughout the world.

C. C. van Asch van Wijck

Jonkvrouwe (Lady) Cornélie Caroline "Cox" van Asch van Wijck (Arnhem 17 October 1900 – Zoelen 18 September 1932) was a Dutch artist and sculptor.
Biography.
Cornélie Caroline "Cox" van Asch van Wijck was the daughter of Jonkheer (Lord) :nl:Hubert Willem van Asch van Wijck (1867–1935) and Gravin (Countess) "Wim" Wilhelmina Philippina van Limburg Stirum. (1873–1941).
She was the fourth of five children: Constance "Conny", Maurits "Maus", Cecilius "Cecil", Cornélie "Cox" and Wilhelmina Adolphina "Dolph". Cox was named for her Aunt the Christian evangelist, Countess Cornelia van Limburg Stirum, founder of the Christian School for Girls in Arnhem ("Christelijke Meisjesschool") later renamed the "Limburg Stirumschool".
In early 1914, the family travelled to Suriname. Cox and her two brothers Maus and Cecil were sent to San Francisco for their studies. Cox attended the "Anna Head School for Girls" at in Berkeley, California. She was the Art Editor of the yearbook and had the ambition to become an artist. In 1925 Cox created a bas-relief for her former headmistress Mary Elizabeth Wilson.
On 2 February 1919, Miss Cornelia van Asch van Wyck appears with Dutch Consul van Coenen Torchiana in the "San Francisco Chronicle, Society Section". The occasion is a reception for Dutch Naval Officers.
Later that year Cox returned to the Netherlands in company of her father. In 1921 Cox was in England where she nearly got engaged to her cousin Graaf (Count) Constantijn Willem Limburg Stirum (1900–1976) before the family interveened. Back in the Netherlands Cox pursued her schooling in the arts with the sculptor Toon Dupuis, the docent at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in the Hague (Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten).
C.C. van Asch van Wijck became an active member of the 1920s Hague (Den Haag) artist community both as a model and as a sculptor. Cox modeled for the artists of her day such as the French painter and pastelist , the sculptor and her Professor , and .
On 7 August 1930, Cox married Hendrik Gerard Johan "Henri" Völcker, Heer van Soelen en den Aldenhaag (Zutphen 16 October 1891, Utrecht 18 December 1955), Henri was the Lord Protector ("heer beschermer") of the village of Zoelen a rural community in the Betuwe only accessible by river ferries. Neither the remoteness of her new home nor her married status stopped Cox from making regular trips to The Hague, to the beach at Scheveningen, to Leerdam, to Gouda etc. either with Henri or by herself. At Soelen she set up her atelier in the gatehouse.
On 18 September 1932 C.C. van Asch van Wijck gave birth to a son, Johan Adolph "Dolph" Völcker, Heer van Soelen en den Aldenhaag, Oud and Niew Hinklenoord whom she named for her youngest sister. She did not survive the birth. She was laid to rest in the Church cemetery of the Reformed Church ("Hervormde kerk") of Zoelen in presence of the whole village and all its notables, as well as many friends and relatives, two carriages were needed for the wreaths alone. After the benediction "The Lord Völcker van Soelen thanked all present for the extraordinary large turnout and, turning to the grave, he said the words: 'Farewell, darling treasure, who was my everything'". (""De Heer Völcker van Soelen dankte al de aanwezigen voor de buitengewoon groote belangstelling en richtte zich tot het graf met de woorden: Vaarwel, dierbare schat, die alles voor mij was.""
Works.
As a sculptor, C.C. van Ash van Wijk's most widely known work is connected with the Glassworks at Leerdam ("Leerdam Glasfabriek"). In 1929 she proposed her sculpture of a Woman's Mask to Petrus Marinus Cochius director of the Glassworks. The design was approved and went into production. It came in two versions; clear and frosted, some of the glass masks were completed with a wooden base.
It was groundbreaking for the Glassworks, they were adding pure art to their line of functional items, in addition to C. C. van Asch van Wijck, the Glassworks had engaged Lucienne Bloch - later well known for her Murals - who created her glass animals (a lioness, a duck etc.). Her work inspired by earlier Glassworks contributor Steph Uiterwaal's "Madonna with Child"(1928). There was a bit of a buzz in the Dutch art world over creating and in glass and with industrial means.
C. C. van Asch van Wijck's mask was part of an exposition in "de Olde Munte" in Arnhem and was well received in de Arnhemsche Courant. In 1930 it won a gold medal at the Wereldtentoonstelling voor Kolonien, Zeevaart en Vlaamse Kunst in Antwerpen (Belgium) (World Fair for Colonies, Navigation, and Flemish Art).
C.C. van Ash van Wijk pursued her forray in combining art and industry by partnering with "Koninklijk Goedewaagen" of Gouda Holland, a manufacturer of earthenware in operation since 1610. She created a flying maiden, "Anunciata", standing in a large round tassa in satinated cream. She signed it with her new monogram adding to her initials the V S of Völcker van Soelen.

Miroslav Radić

Miroslav Radić is a Serbian army officer who became prominent in the Battle of Vukovar, and was later prosecuted for alleged complicity in the Vukovar massacre, but was released after the trial at ICTY found him not guilty.
During the Croatian War of Independence, Radić was a Captain in the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), serving as the commander of the Special Infantry Unit, 1st Battalion, 1st Guards Motorised Brigade.
Thought to have participated in the subsequent Vukovar massacre, Radić was indicted in 1995, along with Mile Mrkšić, Veselin Šljivančanin and Slavko Dokmanović, by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia(ICTY). The indictment accused him of "responsibility for the mass killing at Ovčara, near Vukovar, of approximately 260 captive non-Serb men". Radić was formally charged with "crimes against humanity and war crimes including persecutions on political, racial, and religious grounds, extermination, murder, torture, inhuman acts and cruel treatment.", and pleaded not guilty to all counts.
Radić turned himself in to the war crimes tribunal in 2002. He was acquitted on all counts on 27 September 2007, after it was determined that his soldiers had provided the initial security for Vukovar hospital during the massacre, but the cross-examination of three witnesses failed to produce evidence that Radić himself had knowledge of the massacre at Ovčara during the event.

Hope Lutheran Church (Elgin, North Dakota)

The Hope Lutheran Church, also known as Old Stone Church, is a historic church built in approximately 1898 and located seven miles north of Elgin, North Dakota. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1992. The area of the NRHP listing includes a cemetery as an additional contributing site.
The church is located on a hill above the cemetery. The exterior walls were constructed with local sandstone slabs laid in mud mortar. In 1981, the sandstone is covered with a cement material that gives the exterior the appearance of stucco. In a chapter on the prairie churches of North Dakota, the authors of "Fromer's 500 Places to See Before They Disappear" describe Hope Lutheran as an "evocative sight ... standing alone among the wheat fields" with no steeple, and "only a plain white cross tacked onto its cedar-shingled roof."
According to the church's NRHP nomination, "This church is the only known Catholic church in existence that reflects the German Russian architectural heritage of sandstone and plaster wall construction." The church was built by 12 families from the Beresan district of South Russia, specifically from Petersthal, Kulm, Tarantino, Teplitz and Leipzig. They would have arrived into the area by rail to Menno or Scotland, South Dakota. The parish ceased operation in 1956, and the interior furnishings and entry vestibule were sold and removed at that time.

<doc id="36551045" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36551045" title="Amavis">
Amavis

"Amavis" is an open source content filter for electronic mail,
implementing mail message transfer, decoding, some processing and checking,
and interfacing with external content filters to provide protection against
spam, viruses and other malware.
It can be considered an interface between a mailer (MTA, Mail Transfer Agent)
and one or more content filters.
"Amavis" can be used to:
Notable features:
A common mail filtering installation with "Amavis" consists of a
Postfix as an MTA, SpamAssassin as a spam
classifier, and ClamAV as an anti-virus protection, all running under
a Unix-like operating system. Many other virus scanners (about 30) and
some other spam scanners (CRM114, DSPAM, Bogofilter)
are supported too, as well as some other MTAs.
Interfacing topology.
Three topologies for interfacing with an MTA are supported. The "amavisd"
process can be sandwiched between two instances of an MTA, yielding a classical
after-queue mail filtering setup, or "amavisd" can
be used as an SMTP proxy filter in a before-queue
filtering setup, or the "amavisd" process can be consulted to provide mail
classification but not to forward a mail message by itself, in which case the
consulting client remains in charge of mail forwarding. This last approach is
used in a Milter setup (with some limitations), or with a historical client
program "amavisd-submit".
Since version 2.7.0 a before-queue setup is preferred, as it allows for a mail
message transfer to be rejected during an SMTP session
with a sending client. In an after-queue setup filtering takes place after
a mail message has already been received and enqueued by an MTA, in which
case a mail filter can no longer reject a message, but can only deliver it
(possibly tagged), or discard it, or generate a non-delivery notification,
which can cause unwanted backscatter in case of
bouncing a message with a fake sender address.
A disadvantage of a before-queue setup is that
it requires resources (CPU, memory) proportional to a current (peak) mail
transfer rate, unlike an after-queue setup, where some delay is acceptable
and resource usage corresponds to average mail transfer rate.
With introduction of an option "smtpd_proxy_options=speed_adjust"
in Postfix 2.7.0 the resource requirements for a before-queue content
filter have been much reduced.
In some countries the legislation
does not permits mail filtering to discard a mail message once it has
been accepted by an MTA, so this rules out an after-queue filtering setup
with discarding or quarantining of messages, but leaves a possibility of
delivering (possibly tagged) messages, or rejecting them in a before-queue
setup (SMTP proxy or milter).
Interfacing protocols.
"Amavis" can receive mail messages from an MTA over one or more sockets
of protocol families
PF_INET (IPv4), PF_INET6 (IPv6) or PF_LOCAL (Unix domain socket),
using protocols ESMTP, LMTP, or a simple private protocol AM.PDP can be
used with a helper program like "amavisd-milter"
to interface with milters. On the output side protocols ESMTP or LMTP
can be used to pass a message to a back-end MTA instance or to an LDA, or
a message can be passed to a spawned process over a Unix pipe.
When ESMTP or LMTP are used, a session can optionally be encrypted using
a TLS STARTTLS (RFC 3207) extension
to the protocol. SMTP Command Pipelining (RFC 2920) is supported in
client and server code.
Interfacing with SpamAssassin.
When spam scanning is enabled, a daemon process "amavisd"
is conceptually very similar to a "spamd" process of a SpamAssassin
project. In both cases forked child processes call SpamAssassin
Perl modules directly, hence their performance is similar.
The main difference is in protocols used: "Amavis" typically speaks
a standard ESMTP protocol to an MTA, while in the
spamc/spamd case an MTA typically spawns a "spamc" program passing
a message to it over a Unix pipe, then the "spamc" process transfers
the message to a "spamd" daemon using a private protocol, and "spamd"
then calls SpamAssassin Perl modules.
Design priorities.
Design priorities of the "amavisd-new" (from here on just called 
"Amavis") are: reliability, security, adherence to standards,
performance, and functionality.
Reliability.
With the intention that no mail message could be lost due to unexpected
events like I/O failures, resources depletion and unexpected program
terminations, the "amavisd" program meticulously checks a completion
status of every system call and I/O operation. Unexpected events are
logged if at all possible, and handled with several layers of event 
handling. Amavis never takes a responsibility for a mail message delivery
away from an MTA: the final success status is reported to an MTA only
after the message has been passed on to the back-end MTA instance and
reception was confirmed. In case of any fatal failures during processing
or transferring of a message, the message being processed just stays
in a queue of the front-end MTA instance, to be re-tried later.
This approach also covers potential unexpected host failures, crashes
of the amavisd process or one of its components.
The use of program resources like memory size, file descriptors, disk
usage and creation of subprocesses is controlled. Large mail messages
are not kept in memory, so the available memory size does not impose
a limit on the size of mail messages that can be processed, and memory
resources are not wasted unnecessarily.
Security.
A great deal of attention is given to security aspects, required
by handling potentially malicious, nonstandard or just garbled data
in mail messages coming from untrusted sources.
The process which is handling mail messages runs with reduced privileges
under a dedicated user ID. Optionally it can run chroot-ed.
Risks of buffer overflows and memory allocation bugs is largely
avoided by implementing all protocol handling and mail processing
in Perl, which handles dynamic memory management transparently.
Care is taken that content of processed messages does not inadvertently
propagate to the system. Perl provides an additional security safety net
with its marking of tainted data origination from
the wild, and Amavis is careful to put this Perl feature to good use
by avoiding automatic untainting of data ("use re "taint"") and only
untainting it explicitly at strategic points, late in the data flow.
"Amavis" can use several external programs to enhance its functionality.
These are de-archivers, de-compressors,
virus scanners and spam scanners. As these
programs are often implemented in languages like C
or C++, there is a potential risk that a mail message passed to one of
these programs can cause its failure or even open a security hole. The risk
is limited by running these programs as an unprivileged user ID, and possibly
chroot-ed. Nevertheless, external programs like unmaintained de-archivers
should be avoided. The use of these external programs is configurable, and
they can be disabled selectively or as a group (like all decoders or all
virus scanners).
Performance.
Despite being implemented in an interpreted programming language Perl,
Amavis itself is not slow. The good performance of the functionality
implemented by Amavis itself (not speaking of external components) is
achieved by dealing with data in large chunks (e.g. not line-by-line),
by avoiding unnecessary data copying, by optimizing frequently traversed
code paths, by using suitable data structures and algorithms, as well as
by some low-level optimizations. Bottlenecks are detected during development
by profiling code and by benchmarking. Detailed timing report in the log
can help recognize bottlenecks in a particular installation.
Certain external modules or programs like SpamAssassin or some
command-line virus scanners can be very slow, and using
these would constitute a vast majority of elapsed time and processing
resources, making resources used by Amavis itself proportionally
quite small.
Components like external mail decoders, virus scanners and
spam scanners can each be selectively disabled if they
are not needed. What remains is functionality implemented by Amavis itself,
like transferring mail message from and to an MTA using an SMTP
or LMTP protocol, checking mail header section validity, checking
for banned mail content types, verifying and generating
DKIM signatures.
As a consequence, mail processing tasks like DKIM signing and verification
(with other mail checking disabled) can be exceptionally fast and can rival
implementations in compiled languages 
Even full checks using a fast virus scanner but with spam scanning
disabled can be surprisingly fast.
Adherence to standards.
Implementation of protocols and message structures closely follows a
set of applicable standards such as RFC 5322, RFC 5321, RFC 2033, RFC 3207,
RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 3461, RFC 3462, RFC 3463, RFC 3464,
RFC 4155, RFC 5965, RFC 6376, RFC 5451, RFC 6008, and RFC 4291.
In several cases some functionality was re-implemented in the "Amavis"
code even though a public (CPAN) Perl module exists, but lacks
attention to detail in following a standard or lacks sufficient checking
and handling of errors.
License.
Amavis is licensed under a GPLv2
license. This applies to the current code, as well as to historical
branches. An exception to this are some of the supporting programs
(like monitoring and statistics reporting), which are covered by a
New BSD License.
The project.
The project started in 1997 as a Unix shell script to detect and block
e-mail messages containing a virus. It was intended to
block viruses at the MTA (mail transfer agent) or LDA (local delivery)
stage, running on a Unix-like platform, complementing other virus
protection mechanisms running on end-user personal computers.
Next the tool was re-implemented as a Perl program, which later evolved
into a daemonized process. A dozen of developers took
turns during the first five years of the project, developing several variants
while keeping a common goal, the project name and some of the development
infrastructure.
Since December 2008 the only active branch is officially "amavisd-new",
which is being actively developed and maintained by Mark Martinec since
March 2002. This was agreed between the developers at the time in a
private correspondence: Christian Bricart, Lars Hecking, Hilko Bengen,
Rainer Link and Mark Martinec. The project name "Amavis" is now largely
interchangeable with the name of the "amavisd-new" branch.
Lots of functionality has been added through the years, like adding
protection against spam and other unwanted content,
besides the original virus protection. The focus is kept on reliability,
security, adherence to standards and performance.
A domain "amavis.org" in use by the project was registered in 1998 by
Christian Bricart, one of the early developers, who is still maintaining
the domain name registration. The domain is now entirely dedicated to
the only active branch "amavisd-new". The project mailing list was
moved from SourceForge to amavis.org in March 2011, and is hosted
by Ralf Hildebrandt and Patrick Ben Koetter. The project web page and
the main distribution site is located at the Jožef Stefan Institute,
Ljubljana, Slovenia, where most of the development is taking place
since 2002.
Branches and the project name.
Through the history of the project the name of the project or its
branches varied somewhat. Initially the spelling of the project name
was "AMaViS" (A Mail Virus Scanner), introduced by Christian Bricart.
With a rewrite to Perl the name of the program was "Amavis-perl".
Daemonized versions were initially distributed
under a name "amavisd-snapshot" and then as "amavisd". A modular
rewrite by Hilko Bengen was called "Amavis-ng".
In March 2002 the "amavisd-new" branch was introduced by Mark Martinec,
initially as a patch against "amavisd-snapshot-20020300".
This later evolved into a self-contained project, which is now the only
surviving and actively maintained branch. Nowadays a project name is
preferably spelled "Amavis" (while the name of the program itself
is "amavisd"). The name "Amavis" is now mostly interchangeable
with "amavisd-new".

Helga de Alvear

Helga de Alvear is a Spanish art collector. She was born in the city of Kirn/Nahe (Rheinland-Pfalz), Germany, in 1936. She studied at the Salem School near Lake Constance, and subsequently in Lausanne and Geneva, Switzerland. She furthered her studies afterwards in London for a year.
In 1957 she travelled to Spain to learn Spanish and met the architect Jaime de Alvear. They married in 1959 and she set up residence in Madrid. They have three children, Maria, Ana and Patricia.
In 1967 Helga de Alvear met Juana Mordó and began what would later turn into her art collection. She came into contact with artists from the Cuenca group and from the El Paso group and she became increasingly interested in the Spanish art scene.
In January 1980 she started to work at the Juana Mordó gallery: those were years of apprenticeship, both in relation to management and to honing her knowledge about international art scene, particularly thanks to attending art fairs such as Art Basel, the FIAC in Paris and the Cologne Fair. Furthermore, in 1982 art galleries took a step towards innovating the Spanish scene by establishing the ARCO art fair.
Galería Helga de Alvear, Madrid.
As time passed, Helga de Alvear’s stayed involvemend at the Juana Mordó gallery until in 1984, when Juana died, she took the helm. Over the next 10 years she followed in the artistic and professional footsteps of her mentor.
In 1995, she decided to take a turn in her career by opening a new gallery under her own name in a space measuring more than 900 square metres next to the Reina Sofía Museum. Her latest project championed international contemporary art with a special emphasis on photography, video and installation – at a time when these mediums were practically unknown in Spain.
Today, Helga de Alvear’s project is one of the best-established and longest-running art galleries on the Spanish scene. and it has earned widespread international acclaim.
Helga de Alvear has been awarded the Medal of Extremadura in 2007, the Gold Medal for Merit in the category of Fine Arts in 2008, which is bestowed by the Spanish Ministry of Culture, the Medal of Cáceres in 2011 and Fundación Arte y Mecenazgo Award in the category of Collector in 2012.
Helga de Alvear Collection.
While carrying out her professional duties Helga de Alvear has been able to give free rein to her grand passion: art collecting. At the present time her Collection includes more than 2,500 pieces by Spanish and international artists. The Collection will be donated to the Regional Government of Extremadura and the Centre of Visual Arts is currently being built in the city of Cáceres to house it. It has already hosted four monographic exhibitions:
The mission of the Collection is also to contribute to public awareness about art and it often loans out works to institutions around the world. In addition, it has been the subject of a number of in-depth exhibitions, most importantly:

No Mercy (EP)

No Mercy is the third EP by the South Korean male pop group B.A.P released digitally on July 19, 2012, and physically on July 24, 2012 under the label of TS Entertainment. It features the singles "Goodbye" and "No Mercy". 
On August 30, 2012, the repackaged version of the EP, renamed "Crash", was digitally released. The repackage contained two new songs including "Crash" and Yong Guk's "I Remember" (feat. Daehyun) along with the five previous tracks.
Production background.
The title of the EP was revealed on July 12, 2012 along with the album cover and tracklisting. The album jacket photos of the individual members were released on July 15 and 16, 2012 which introduced the urban pop boy concept for the promotions.
The first single from the EP is a pop-rock ballad "Goodbye" that features falsetto vocals and strong rap. The song is composed by Jeon Daun who also participated to write G.NA‘s “Because You’re My Person“ and K.Will‘s “Struck Dumb” along with B.A.P's own member Yong Guk. The B.A.P member Yong Guk also helped to pen the lyrics. "Goodbye" also featured guitarist TOP who worked with Seo Taeji over 10 years also worked on B.A.P for the single. “Goodbye” describes encouragement for fans to “never be frightened of new beginnings” and to “keep their hopes alive for their dreams.”
The second and lead single “No Mercy” is composed and produced by Marco and Jeon Daun of TS Entertainment. Once again member Yong Guk helped with the lyrics. The rapping parts of the song utilizes the Gyeongsangdo dialect. It also makes use of “samul nori“, a type of traditional Korean percussion music. This song is quite similar in comparison with group's previous singles “Warrior” and “Power", as it brings back many of the group's signature style, especially the use of whistles in the instrumental.
The third track is a hip hop-ballad song "Voicemail" and the first by the group that is entirely written by member Yong Guk. The song is about having a regret after a breakup. It also integrates the use of phone sounds in the instrumental.
The title song from the repackage version of the EP released on August 30, 2012, "Crash", is the work of Duble Sidekick and expresses the feelings of falling in love. The track has British rock base mixed with guitar sounds.
Release history.
"No Mercy" was released digitally on July 19, 2012 under the label of TS Entertainment. The physical release was originally scheduled to be on July 19, 2012 as well but was delayed to July 24, 2012 because of the problems with the finished product. The special single "Goodbye" was released 10 days ahead of the album release whereas the lead single "No Mercy" was released on the same date as the album. On August 30, 2012, the repackaged version of the EP, renamed "Crash", was released.

Ping Fu

Ping Fu (born 1958) is a Chinese-American entrepreneur. She is the co-founder of 3D software development company Geomagic, and was its chief executive officer until February 2013 when the company was acquired by 3D Systems Inc. , she is the Vice President and Chief Entrepreneur Officer at 3D Systems. Fu grew up in China during the Cultural Revolution and moved to the United States in 1984. She co-founded Geomagic in 1997 with her then-husband Herbert Edelsbrunner, and has been recognized for her achievements with the company through a number of awards, including being named "Inc." magazine's 2005 "Entrepreneur of the Year". In 2013, she published her memoir, "Bend, Not Break", co-authored with MeiMei Fox.
Early life and education.
Ping Fu was born in 1958 in Nanjing, China, where her father was a professor at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA). Fu spent her childhood and early adulthood in China. She grew up during the Cultural Revolution, during which she was separated from both her parents for several years. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, she attended the college that later became the Suzhou University studying Chinese literature. Fu has related in interviews and in her memoir that she chose to research China's one-child policy for her thesis and traveled to the countryside, where she found that infanticide of female infants was common, as was abortion, even late into pregnancy. Fu said that, after turning in her research, she believes it was passed to a newspaper editor who wrote an editorial on the infanticide of female children. Fu has stated that she was later briefly imprisoned by government officials and was told to leave the country. After this event, she left school, without graduating.
Fu left China and arrived in the United States in January 1984. She initially enrolled at the University of New Mexico (UNM) in Albuquerque but later moved to San Diego to study computer science as an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego. During her time in San Diego, Fu worked part-time at a software company called Resource Systems Group as a programmer and database software consultant. Following her graduation from UC San Diego with a bachelor's degree in computer science, she moved to Illinois, where she took a job with Bell Labs. The company offered a Ph.D assistance program, through which Fu enrolled in the computer science Ph.D program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). At UIUC she completed a master's degree in computer science.
Career.
National Center for Supercomputing Applications.
In the early 1990s, Fu began working at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at UIUC. Her focus was on computer graphics and visualization, including projects such as developing the morphing software for animation of the liquid metal T-1000 robot in the film "". While at NCSA, she hired student researcher Marc Andreessen and was his supervisor on the project developing NCSA's Mosaic, an early multimedia web browser credited with popularizing the World Wide Web. According to her supervisor, Joseph Hardin, Fu was one of the managers involved in the discussions from which the idea for the browser was developed. In 1994 Ping took a temporary position at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, returning to NCSA in 1995.
Geomagic.
In 1996, Marc Andreessen's success with his own company, Netscape, inspired UIUC to encourage entrepreneurship and Fu developed the idea for a company that would combine manufacturing and digital technology, including 3D modeling software, the concept of which she called the "Personal Factory". She founded Geomagic with her then-husband, Herbert Edelsbrunner, whose research formed the basis for the initial software to be developed by the company. In 1997, she left the NCSA to begin operations at Geomagic, taking on the role of CEO. The company was originally named Raindrop Geomagic and was based in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. It was founded with the aim of developing 3D imaging software that could enable customized manufacturing using 3D printers. Initially, Fu and Edelsbrunner funded Geomagic themselves, along with investment from Fu's sister Hong and her husband, and later from a group of angel investors.
In 1999, Fu relocated Geomagic from Illinois to the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. That year, Franklin Street Partners committed to invest $6.5 million in Geomagic. Fu then hired an experienced executive as CEO who ran Geomagic for two years before stepping down when the company was close to bankruptcy. Fu returned to the role of CEO in 2001, investing her own money into Geomagic and working without a salary in order to continue paying the company's employees. She was able to lead Geomagic back to stability, gaining a significant contract with Align Technology, and Geomagic returned to profitability over the following two years.
From 2001 to 2003, Geomagic's sales tripled under Fu's leadership. The company became known as a leader in digital shape sampling and processing. After she divorced Edelsbrunner, he continued to serve as an advisor at Geomagic.
In February 2013, Fu sold Geomagic to 3D Systems Corporation, a 3D printing company. She became the Chief Strategy Officer and Vice-President of 3D Systems.
Other roles.
In addition to leading Geomagic, Fu has held a number of advisory roles relating to technology and entrepreneurship and with charitable organizations. She has served on the U.S. National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship since 2010 and is also a member of the National Council on Women in Technology. In 2012, she was appointed to the board of the Long Now Foundation, a non-profit organization focused on long-term thinking and enduring technology. She also serves on the board of the Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina and is an advisor at Modern Meadow, an organization focused on tissue engineering.
Memoir.
On December 31, 2012, Fu published a memoir, "Bend, Not Break: A Life in Two Worlds". Co-authored with MeiMei Fox, the book told the stories of her life, from her early childhood in China to her experiences as an entrepreneur, including founding and leading Geomagic. The book received positive reviews from outlets including "The Wall Street Journal" and Oprah.com.
Beginning in January 2013, commentors in the Amazon.com reviews for the memoir began posting critical reviews, accusing Fu of lying about events in her past. Around the same time, first in English, then in Chinese on "Forbes China", "Forbes" published an interview with Fu that discussed Fu's memoir and her early life, which contained an inaccurate interpretation of where Ping Fu lived during the cultural revolution. Chinese netizens responded to the piece with criticisms regarding alleged fabrication of events and inconsistencies in media coverage of Fu, which raised questions in the media about the veracity of details included in the memoir. Chinese blogger Fang Zhouzi was among the critics and he later raised further questions and criticisms based on earlier media coverage of Fu. Following the initial criticisms from Fang Zhouzi and other critics, commentors appearing to be non-native English speakers knowledgeable about Chinese history posted hundreds of negative comments in the memoir's Amazon.com reviews, leading "The Daily Beast" and "New York Times" to conclude that Ping was the subject of an online attack.
Fu responded to the criticisms through a public statement, and a post on the "Huffington Post" website answering questions that were raised about her childhood, education and being forced to leave China. She acknowledged that there were some inaccuracies in the book. She also acknowledged that the Red Guard atrocity she related in the memoir and media interviews regarding a teacher being pulled apart by four horses may have been an emotional memory, the result of hearing tales of such barbarity in old China as a child and having nightmares about it, or seeing it in a movie, rather than actually seeing it. In response to questions about accuracy of details in the book, her publisher stated that the book is a memoir, rather than a journalistic account of the Cultural Revolution. Fu has said that a second print of the memoir will correct inaccuracies that have been pointed out.
Awards and recognitions.
For her work with Geomagic, Fu has received a number of awards. In 2003 she was named the Ernst & Young "Entrepreneur of the Year" for the Carolinas and received the Entrepreneurial Inspiration Award from North Carolina's Council for Entrepreneurial Development. The following year, "Fast Company" named her a 2004 "Fast 50" winner. In 2005, "Inc." magazine named Ping its "Entrepreneur of the Year".
The America China Business Women’s Alliance awarded Fu its "Business Innovation Award" in 2008 and she received the 2010 "Leadership Award" from the CAD Society. The next year, she was given a "Lifetime Achievement" award by the "Triangle Business Journal". In 2011 she was given the William C. Friday Award at North Carolina State University, and in 2012, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services named Fu as an "Outstanding American by Choice".

Excerpts.
John Gorton's General Biographical Dictionary provides the following information about Vincent Placcius:
"Vincent Placcius, a learned jurist, was born at Hamburg in 1642. He studied at Helmstadt, and after travelling in France and Italy, he returned to his native city, where he practiced at the bar, and was appointed professor of morals and eloquence, which post he held until his death in 1699. His principal work is a curious bibliographical piece respecting anonymous and pseudonymous writers, entitled "De Scriptis et Scriptoribus anonymis atque pseudonymous Syntagma"."
Alexander Chalmers' General Biographical Dictionary provides the following information about Vincent Placcius:
"Vincent Placcius was an eminent philologer of Hamburgh, where he was born in 1642, completed his studies at Helmstadt and Leipzig, and improved his talents by travelling in France and Italy. When he returned, he applied himself to the bar, and afterwards became professor of morals and eloquence, in which situation he continued twenty-four years. He was beloved by his pupils, and when he died, April 6, 1699, regretted by his countrymen in general, who had considered him as an oracle. His works are, 1. “A Dictionary of anonymous and pseudonymous Authors,” published in 1708, in 2 vols. folio, by the care of Fabricius a curious work, but abounding with faults, 2. “De jurisconsulto perito Liber,” 1693, 8vo. 3. “Carmina juvenilia,” Amst. 1667, 12mo. 4. “De arte excer-, pendi,” Hamburgh, 1689, 8vo, with several others, all | testifying, and abundantly proving, his talents and erudition."

The "East River Monster" was an unidentified animal that washed ashore dead, on a beach under the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, New York. It was photographed by Denise Ginley on July 22, 2012. The creature has been compared to the Montauk Monster discovered four years earlier. The NYC Parks Department said that it was a discarded cooked pig, but Ginley says "the feet are not pig-like at all," and that there were "No hooves or cloven feet to be seen — it definitely had five toes on all its paws, front and back." Paul Curtis, a naturalist professor at Cornell University thought the animal was a small dog after examining the photos.

A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III

A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III is a 2013 American comedy film directed, written and produced by Roman Coppola. It stars Charlie Sheen, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Katheryn Winnick and Patricia Arquette. It premiered at the 2012 Rome Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release on February 8, 2013, in the United States.
Plot.
In the 1970s, successful graphic designer and ladies' man Charles Swan III (Sheen) is dumped by his girlfriend Ivana (Winnick), and it throws his life into a tailspin. He does not know whether he loves her or hates her or wants her back or never wants to see her again. Along with his best friend, Kirby (Schwartzman) and his manager, Saul (Murray), Charles starts to suffer from nightmares, fever dreams of past relationships and hits rock bottom as he tries to recover from the recent breakup and tries to turn his life around.
Production.
Filmed on location in Santa Clarita and Los Angeles, California.
Music.
“It was surreal,” says the Chicago composer and performer Liam Hayes, about appearing in the forthcoming Roman Coppola film A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III. “I haven’t played many gigs on a beach with a Hammond organ, you know?” Hayes, who has made music under the name Plush since the early ’90s, was contacted by Coppola after the director became a huge fan. “I just got so absorbed by his music,” Coppola recently told GQ (UK) about Hayes and Plush.
The result of this appreciation was Hayes and Coppola making a soundtrack out of Hayes’ music. “It evolved,” says Hayes. “When we met to discuss the project we talked about possible songs. We talked some more, added a few more songs, and I ended up doing the score.” Hayes also appears in the film performing the tune “So Much Music.” It isn’t his first time onscreen: In 2000 he appeared in High Fidelity performing his song "Soaring and Boring". His imaginative, atmospheric, cinematic style is well suited to movie soundtracks, and his Charles Swan soundtrack is made up of songs from Fed, Bright Penny and the forthcoming Korp Sole Roller along with music written specifically for the film.
Release.
On January 8, 2013, the film received a release on several video on demand outlets, and was put in limited release in the United States on February 8, 2013. It was released onto Blu-ray on May 14, 2013.
Reception.
Critical response.
"A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III" received an overwhelmingly negative response from critics. Nathan Rabin of "The A.V. Club" gave the movie an F, saying that "it isn't a movie so much as a feature-length perfume commercial for a Charlie Sheen signature cologne with gorgeous packaging and absolutely nothing inside." The "Dallas Observer" said that the film "might generously be described as cut-and-paste – or more accurately as 'throw stuff to the wall and see what sticks'" and it was "a clunker". "The New York Daily News" gave "Charles Swan III" one star out of five, saying that "you want to swat it away" and that "maybe with this out of his [Coppola's] system, he'll think up something better." "TIME" said that the film "does not lead to a deeper understanding of Charlie Sheen. It does, however, demonstrate his compulsion for poor judgment and bad choices. But weren't we already convinced of that?"
Lisa Schwarzbaum, reviewer for "Entertainment Weekly", gave the film a C and a milder response, writing, "The idea of this home-movie-with-higher-production-values directed by Roman Coppola is no less sweet for being unoriginal... The execution, on the other hand, is perilously self-absorbed, a private party involving friends, family, too many fantasy sequences, and an abundance of costume and set design to create a notion of a stylized L.A. spritzed with eau de "Playboy"."
The film holds a 16% "rotten" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 51 reviews. Metacritic gave the film a 28/100 "generally unfavorable" approval rating based on 21 reviews.
Box office.
The film opened at #64 with US$12,000 in its limited release at two theaters the week of 8 February. The following weekend, the weekend of 15 February, "Charles Swan III" expanded to 18 theaters and gained an 81.6% increase. As of 11 July 2013, the domestic total of "A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III" is US$45,350, and in Russia the film has grossed $134,473, with an additional $26,999 in Mexico.

Esther Stroy

Esther Stroy (born August 12, 1953) is a former American track and field athlete, who competed in the sprints events. She is best known for competing at the 1968 Olympics in the 400 metres as a 15 year old, the youngest competitor at those games.
Track career.
Esther Stroy was only 15 years and 64 days old when she competed at the 1968 Olympics.
In 2012, Stroy, now Esther Stroy-Harper, remembered it as a it being "more than the world’s best summer vacation. It was the opportunity of a lifetime".
In the 400 m event itself, she reached the semi-final but injured herself whilst leading the race and finally finished fifth so therefore not qualifying for the final. Her Olympic misfortune was repeated in 1972. As Stroy-Harper recalls “Right before the 1972 Olympics, I injured that same hamstring, so I didn’t make the team. I went to Munich, but as a spectator.”
In the 1968 United States Olympic Trials, Stroy was third in the 400 m event and was entered but did not compete in the 200 m. In 1972, she was third in her heat of the 200 m and was entered but did not compete in the 400 m.
Between the two Olympics, she continued running for her universities and country. 
The high point of her career was winning gold at the 1971 Pan American Games in the 4 x 400 meter relay and bronze in the 200 meters. She also won the 220 yards dash at the 1971 and 1972 AAU Indoor Championships.
In 1971, she was a member of a 4 x 1 mile women's relay team that set a new world record at a USA versus Pan-Africa meet.
In 1969, she was ranked 2nd in the USA and 9th in the world in the 400 metres/440 yards by the votes of the experts of Track and Field News.
Personal life.
Stroy was the eighth of eleven children of Mr and Mrs Dennis Stroy. Her father was a cab driver in the District of Columbia. 
Esther Stroy attended Nevelle Thomas Elementary School then Spingarn High School, Washington D.C.
Stroy also joined a neighbourhood track club. Here she came under the tutelage of Brooks Johnson, now one of America's best known track coaches but at that time he was still a relative novice coach. She was to become Brook's first of many Olympians.
Her father was able to see her run in Mexico City in the 1968 Olympics, but her mother unfortunately was not able to having injured herself during the preparations to travel. Being of high school age, Stroy attended classes at a local school during the six weeks of the Olympics training camp at Los Alamos, New Mexico in order to maintain her academic skills.
Stroy attended Howard University after graduating from Spingarn. After Howard, she attended Stanford University where she began her career as a coach and a recruiter. She worked in California for several years before returning to Washington D.C. In Washington, she continued working as a coach, mainly working with young athletes aged 8 to 17/18.
Stroy is married to Daniel Harper, a retired United States Army colonel, and now uses the surname Stroy-Harper.

Telegraph Avenue (novel)

Telegraph Avenue is a novel by Michael Chabon, published on September 11, 2012. An extensive excerpt from the enhanced e-book edition was released online on July 25, 2012. The novel's setting is North Oakland and Berkeley, California. The title refers to Telegraph Avenue, which runs through both cities.
Plot summary.
Set during the summer of 2004, the novel's main plotline concerns Archy Stallings and Nat Jaffe. Archy is black, Nat is white and Jewish. The two have been the proprietors of Brokeland Records, a brick-and-mortar store located in North Oakland, on Telegraph Avenue, for twelve years. Their used vinyl business, never very strong, is threatened with extinction by ex-NFL superstar Gibson Goode's planned construction of his second Dogpile Thang megastore two blocks away. They feel betrayed because their local city councilman, Chandler Flowers, has suddenly switched sides, and now supports Dogpile.
A major subplot concerns their wives Gwen Shanks (who is heavily pregnant with her first) and Aviva Roth-Jaffe, who are partners in Berkeley Birth Partners, a midwifery business. A home birth goes a little bit wrong, the mother is rushed to the hospital, and the attending physician, after taking care of the mother, insults Gwen in a racially-tinged manner. She blows up, and the doctor has the hospital start procedures to drop Gwen and Aviva's hospital privileges.
A third plotline concerns Luther Stallings, Archy's father. Luther had been an actor in a few blaxploitation films in the 70s, including the lead role in the two "Strutter" films. But personally he had never been part of Archy's life, and Archy wants nothing to do with him. Luther has been in and out of jail and on and off drugs since his acting career ended, has been clean for over a year, and he keeps himself fighting trim. He is involved with his former co-star Valetta Moore, who played Candygirl Clark. Her noted taglines "Do what you got to do" and "Stay fly" still resonate with characters in the novel.
Luther had been best friends with Chandler in the old days. Their friendship came to a sudden end, after Luther abetted Chandler in the murder of a drug dealer. Luther is trying to exploit his knowledge in order to finance the making of the third "Strutter" film.
A fourth plotline concerns Julius Jaffe, Nat and Aviva's 14-year old son, and his new best buddy, Titus Joyner, who has shown up from Texas after his grandmother died. Titus, it turns out, is Archy's long lost son. His arrival is pretty much the last straw in Gwen's strained relationship with Archy.
Setting up a gig for a fundraiser for an obscure Illinois politician Barack Obama, running for U.S. Senate, Archy learns of the death of local music legend Cochise Jones—Archy's spiritual father—from his Hammond organ falling on him, and Archy fills in. Obama is very impressed with the performance, and tells Gwen he admires Archy's obvious dedication to doing what he loves, purple suit and all. Gwen takes those words to heart, and resolves to stand up for herself. The first stand she takes is to walk out on Archy.
The funeral for Jones is held in the store. Plans are made, people get drunk, and the stage is set for the shaking up everyone's future.

Scharfenstein Castle (Ore Mountains)

Scharfenstein Castle () lies on an elongated hill spur above the village of Scharfenstein, in the municipality of Drebach in the Ore Mountains of Saxony, Germany. The castle is one of 24 sites run by the state-owned State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony ("Staatliche Schlösser, Burgen und Gärten Sachsen").
History.
The original structure was built in 1250. It is suspected that the von Waldenburgs ordered its construction, but only its first owner occupant is known for certain. The von Waldenburgs had in their possession the estates of Waldenburg, Rabenstein, Scharfenstein, and Wolkenstein, which covered a contiguous area extending from the middle reaches of the River Pleiße to the Ore Mountain crest. Nine villages paid duties to the lord of the castle, including Grießbach, Großolbersdorf, Drebach and Herold. When, in the 15th century, Greifenstein Castle was destroyed, Scharfenstein also took over the guardianship of Thum, Ehrenfriedersdorf and Geyer. As a result, its value increased, so that in 1439 the Elector acquired the area from the Waldenburgs who were heavily indebted to him. On 26 January 1492 Henry of Einsiedel bought Scharfenstein Castle and its associated villages of Grießbach, Großolbersdorf, Grünau, Hohndorf Hopfgarten and Scharfenstein It remained in the family until 1931.
Following a fire during the night of 1/2 June 1921 the entire residential wing and part of the domestic wing was destroyed. From 1921 to 1923 the damaged wings were partially rebuilt to plans by Bodo Ebhardt, based on the old design. 
In 1931, a factory owner, Captain Eulitz from Fährbrücke, acquires possession. By his efforts in 1932 in a bird observatory was established. Hundreds of nest boxes were put up throughout the 325 hectares of woodland on the estate; bird-ringing was carried out and scientific reports published, with the support of the Chemnitz Ornithological Society. In 1945 this forest was seized and made public property, the castle was initially used as the mining school for the state-owned Wismut mining company and, in 1951, a special children's home was established here for maladjusted boys. In 1967, it was converted into a detention centre for juvenile delinquents. Ornithological work was undertaken by the museum at Augustusburg Castle.
In 1993 the castle was taken over by the Saxon Palace Department of the Free State of Saxony ("Freistaat Sachsen – Sächsische Schlösserverwaltung"). In the period that followed the castle was renovated as a historic monument and converted into a museum. In 1995, on the completion of the renovation work, various exhibitions were opened - and for the first time since 1945, the castle was again open to the public. The "bergfried" is still used today as an observation tower.

Crayfish (food)

Crayfish (better known in Louisiana as "crawfish") are eaten all over the world. Like other edible crustaceans, only a small portion of the body of a crayfish is edible. In most prepared dishes, such as soups, bisques and étouffées, only the tail portion is served. At crayfish boils or other meals where the entire body of the crayfish is presented, other portions, such as the claw meat, may be eaten.
Claws of larger boiled specimens are often pulled apart to access the meat inside. Another favourite is to suck the head of the crayfish, as seasoning and flavour can collect in the fat of the boiled interior.
A common myth is that a crayfish with a straight tail died before it was boiled and is not safe to eat. In reality, crayfish that died before boiling can have curled tails as well as straight, as can those that were alive, and may very well be fine to eat. Boiled crayfish which died before boiling are safe to eat if they were kept chilled before boiling and were not dead for a long time. (This does not mean that a sack of crayfish that are all dead should be boiled.) A much better test than the straight tail as to the edibility of any crayfish is the tail meat itself; if it is mushy, it is usually an indication that it should be avoided.
Like all crustaceans, crayfish are not kosher because they are aquatic animals that do not have both fins and scales. They are therefore not eaten by observant Jews.
Australia.
Australia is home to genus "Cherax" which is distinct from European, Asian and North American species. Two of the Australian edible crayfish are the common yabby ("C. destructor") and the red claw ("C. quadricarinatus"). The common yabby is closest in size to the North American species, but is not considered to be commercially viable outside Australia because of its relatively slow growth and small size. The "red claw" crayfish are twice the size of North American crayfish and they contain 30% edible "meat" compared to 15% for "P. clarkii". Other Australian species are fairly rare and thus usually are not used for food. Their slow growth generally makes them inefficient for aquaculture.
China.
The culinary popularity of crayfish swept across mainland China in the late 1990s. Crayfish is generally served with Mala flavour (a combined flavour of Sichuan pepper and hot chili) or otherwise plainly steamed whole, to be eaten with a preferred sauce. In Beijing, the "ma la" flavoured crayfish () is shortened to "ma xiao" () and is often enjoyed with beer in a hot mid-summer evening.
France.
In France, dishes with a base or garnish of crayfish (') are frequently described as ' (in the style of Nantes).
Crayfish tails and butter are also used to flavor the Nantua Sauce commonly served with Quenelles.
Mexico.
The Mexican crayfish locally named acocil was a very important nutrition source of the ancient Mexican Aztec culture. Other regional names for crayfish are chacales, chacalines and langostas de río. Today, crayfish is consumed mainly boiled, similarly to crayfish dishes in other parts of the world, or prepared with typically Mexican sauces and condiments, particularly in central and southern Mexico. Traditional preparations include soups, tacos and "cocktails" similar to shrimp dishes.
Nigeria.
Crayfish are usually smoked, and occasionally sun-dried, and they form an indispensable food item in the diet of the people of the entire southern states in particular and Nigeria as a whole. It is a core of Nigerian cooking.
Russia and Ukraine.
In Russia and Ukraine, crayfish (', sing. ') are a traditional seasonal appetizer that is used as an accompaniment to beer and liquor. Although native varieties tend to be larger (usually, "Astacus astacus"), rampant freshwater pollution and years of overfishing largely limit availability to imports—most from Armenia, Kazakhstan and China. Prior to cooking, the crustaceans are soaked in water or milk, then boiled live for 7–15 minutes in rapidly boiling salted water with additional ingredients, such as carrots, onion, dill, parsley, bay leaf, peppercorns. More extravagant preparations include such ingredients as white wine, beer, sour cream, cloves, caraway seed, coriander seed, chili peppers, stinging nettle, etc. Russians rarely incorporate crayfish into complex dishes and, unlike other cultures, they usually consume the entire crayfish, short of the shell and the antennae. Russian and Ukrainian fascination with crayfish goes back quite far and generates considerable lore. An old proverb: "When there is no fish, even crayfish is a fish." There are as many myth associated with picking the freshest live crayfish as there are for picking ripe watermelons. Russians and Ukrainians, generally, will not cook fresh crayfish if the crustaceans are dead or perceptibly lethargic. (But pre-boiled frozen specimens are acceptable.)
Scandinavia.
Crayfish is a popular dish in Sweden and Finland, and is by tradition primarily consumed during the fishing season in August. The boil is typically flavored with salt, sugar, ale, and large quantities of stems and flowers of the dill plant. While most Americans eat them warm, the Swedes and Finns normally eat them cold. One traditional Swedish and Finnish practice is to eat crayfish with a vodka or akvavit chaser. The catch of domestic freshwater crayfish, "Astacus astacus", and even of a transplanted American species, "Pacifastacus leniusculus", is very limited, and to satisfy demand, the majority of what is consumed has to be imported. Sales depended on imports from Spain and Turkey for several decades, but after a decline in supply, China and the United States are today the biggest sources of import.
Spain.
In Spain, crayfish is called ' (lit. "river crab"). They used to be widely consumed, especially in Castile and León and Aragon, but over-fishing and the introduction of non-native crayfish species (e.g. "Procambarus clarkii", commonly called ') led to a dramatic decline in crayfish population. Nowadays they remain as a seasonal delicacy, usually stewed in tomato sauce, although fishing the native crayfish is strictly forbidden since the species is nearly extinct. Instead of the native crayfish, it is common to fish "Procambarus clarkii" or "Pacifastacus leniusculus", also present in most of the Spanish rivers.
United States.
As of 2005, Louisiana supplies 95% of the crayfish harvested in the United States. In 1987, Louisiana produced 90% of the crayfish harvested in the world, 70% of which were consumed locally. In 2007, the Louisiana crawfish harvest was about 54,800 tons, almost all of it from aquaculture. About 70%–80% of crayfish produced in Louisiana are "Procambarus clarkii" (red swamp crawfish), with the remaining 20%–30% being "Procambarus zonangulus" (white river crawfish). Despite the large-scale production in Louisiana, most frozen crayfish available in supermarkets in other states are Chinese imports.
Louisiana crawfish are usually boiled live in a large pot with heavy seasoning (salt, cayenne pepper, lemon, garlic, bay leaves, etc.) and other items such as potatoes, corn on the cob, onions, garlic, mushrooms, turkey necks, and sausage. There are many differing methods used to season a crawfish boil, and an equal number of opinions on which one is correct. They are generally served at a gathering known as a crawfish boil. Other popular dishes in the Cajun and Creole cuisines of Louisiana include crawfish étouffée, fried crawfish, crawfish pie, crawfish dressing, crawfish bread and crawfish beignets.

Corto Maltese is a fictional country appearing in DC Comics.
Fictional history.
Corto Maltese is a small island off the coast of South America. It has been referenced in two non-canonical DC sources. Corto Maltese is confirmed to exist in the mainstream DC Universe, where there was a tossed-off reference in a newspaper headline: "More Arms to Corto Maltese."
"The Dark Knight Returns".
Corto Maltese appears in Frank Miller's graphic novel "" as the name of an island at the center of an incident not unlike the Cuban missile crisis. Corto Maltese was also the site of a rebel uprising in the second issue of the series. Soviet destroyers arrived off the tiny nation's coast. Superman was sent by the US Government to fight the Soviet presence there in secret, until the battle became too intense and the Soviets unleashed the Coldbringer missile.
Corto Maltese is the name of a comic book character, a sailor in the South Pacific and elsewhere, which was created by an Italian cartoonist named Hugo Pratt. There are several Corto Maltese comic books and movies, although there are few, if any, in English. It can be assumed that Miller's use of the name is a tribute to Pratt. The only other known use of the name is that of a small street somewhere in Italy. It could also be rendered as a name, both in Spanish and Italian, in which it could mean a short ("corto") person from Malta (Maltese) but the question of the meaning of the name seems unsettled.

The first numbers in the sequence are 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20 . It is known that the natural density of such numbers is 1: indeed, the proportion of numbers less than "X" which are not arithmetic is asymptotically
where "c" = 2 √ log 2 + o(1).
A number "N" is arithmetic if the number of divisors "d"("N") divides the sum of divisors σ("N"). It is known that the density of integers "N" for which "d"("N")2 divides σ("N") is 1/2.

Francisco Fernández Fernández

Francisco Fernández Fernández (24 July 1901 – 7 September 2012) was a Spanish supercentenarian. Fernández was the oldest living Spanish person, the oldest living man in Europe, the world's third oldest living man, and one of the 65 oldest men ever at the time of his death at age 111 years 45 days.
Biography.
Francisco Fernández Fernández was born in Pinilla de la Valdería, a small town in Castille and León, Spain. At the age of 14, Fernández got lost with the cattle that he was taking care of, and later he was found close to freezing to death.
He emigrated to Argentina in 1927 and he accumulated enough money to return to Pinilla in 1936 with the purpose of moving his family to Argentina with him, but some months later the Spanish Civil War started and he lost his papers, so he couldn't return to Argentina with his family.
Fernández almost died at the age of 40 of pneumonia, but recuperated successfully and cheated death. Since then, Fernández had never been ill.
Fernández said that even at the age of 111 he lived a good life: he'd wake up late, the people looking after him would shave and wash him, and a "very kind" woman would take him for a walk, he also read the newspaper and watched television, even though his hearing was quite poor by the time he died.
Fernandez died of pneumonia on 7 September 2012 at the age of 111 years and 45 days.

Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe

The "Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe" (Turkish: "Avrupa Batı Trakya Türk Federasyonu", short: "ABTTF", Greek: "Ευρωπαϊκή Ομοσπονδία Τούρκων Δυτικής Θράκης", short: "ΕΟΤΔΘ") established in 1988 in Germany as a nonprofit umbrella organization by seven founding associations in Germany and with participation of the Association of Western Thrace Turks in the UK, the organisation adopted its current name, Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe.
With headquarters in Witten, Germany, ABTTF is represented through an office in Brussels, Belgium, since 2010. The organization has 29 member associations in Germany and one in England that, in total, it unites 6.000 affiliated members. ABTTF is the first organization that has been granted special consultative status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council as a representative body of the Turkish Minority of Western Thrace.
History.
The Convention concerning the exchange of Greek and Turkish populations signed on 30 January 1923 in the aftermath of the Greco-Turkish War 1919-22 exempted the exchange of Muslim Turkish population living in Western Thrace and the Greek Orthodox minority in Istanbul and on the islands of Imbros (Gökçeada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada).
Geographically Western Thrace covers the provinces of Komotini, Xanthi and Evros and is situated between Evros River on the eastern frontier of Greece with Turkey and the Rodophe mountains on the north, which constitute Greece's natural border with Bulgaria.
Treaty of Lausanne, further to the agreed Convention on exchange of both populations, regulated at the same time the status and rights of remaining folks in each undersigning state of the Treaty. A population of 150.000 Muslim Turks living in Western Thrace were granted therefore the official minority status. The Turkish Muslim Minority’s status in Western Thrace is explicitly defined within the Articles 37-44 of the Lausanne Treaty.
According to the officially granted minority status within the Section III of the Treaty of Lausanne, Turkish Minority of Western Thrace are given equal rights to “establish, manage and control at their own expense any charitable, religious and social institutions, any schools and other establishments for instruction and education, with the right to use their own language and to exercise their own religion freely therein”.
From 1950s on, Greek authorities did not comply with obligations undersigned in the Treaty, which gave way to considerable human rights violations. Growing political instability due to the Greek civil war followed by the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 further instigated Greek nationalism thus, exacerbated the situation of minorities, in particular of the Turkish Minority of Western Thrace.
Increased tensions over Greece-Turkey relations during this period were reflected as suppression and assimilation policies started against the Turkish Minority of Western Thrace in 1960s and grew in intensity through 1970s. The policies put in place by Greek authorities with motivations of intimidation of the respective minority have manifested themselves as “dissolution” of the Minority and eventually leaving territories by means of “forced migration”.
Unconstitutional denaturalization policy due to the former Article 19 of Greek Nationality Code, which was in force in 1955-1998, stipulated “a person of non-Greek ethic origin leaving Greece without the intention of returning may be declared as having lost Greek nationality...” clearly aimed at elimination of Turkish Minority of Western Thrace from the region.
Being threatened at multiple dimensions of their lives; be it social, political, economic and cultural spheres, the Turkish Minority were forced to migrate. While the vast majority of migration wave was towards Turkey, some groups chose to migrate to European countries, in particular to Germany.
Today, including the third generation, population of Western Thrace Turks in Germany amounts to 30.000. Except overseas like Australia, the United States of America and Canada, there is a considerable number of Western Thrace Turkish population living dispersed in other EU Member States, such as the Netherlands, England, Sweden, France, Belgium and Austria.
The need to keep alive their socio-cultural values and maintain solidarity in their host countries led the Western Thrace Turks to summon under collectively created associations.
In Germany, the first Western Thrace Turks Association was established on 1 January 1978 in the city of Giessen of the state Hessen. This was followed by foundation of other Western Thrace Turks Associations in Stuttgart, Homburg/Saar, Munich, Düsseldorf, Kelsterbach and so on. The dramatic rise in the number of associations established by the Western Thrace Turks living in Europe has been a response to Greece’s assimilation policies pursued towards the Minority in the region.
In the beginning of 1980s, despite being accessed to the EU as a fully member, the successive Greek governments have not given up from their suppression policy against minority groups, primarily to the Turkish Minority of Western Thrace. At that stage, initial reactions were raised through the Western Thrace Turks’ associations established in Germany. Western Thrace Turks associations in Germany, whose number were on a constant increase, have established Coordination Committees aimed at advanced cooperation and increased solidarity. The efforts invested on this way gave its fruits on 28 February 1988 with official establishment of Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Germany co-founded by seven member associations.
By establishment of the new federation in Germany, Western Thrace Turks attained a large sphere of representation, which assured the political, social, cultural, educational and other problems of the Minority to be voiced on international arena as well as coordination and cooperation between other associations established by the Western Thrace Turks.
With its increasing number of member associations, Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Germany has become Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe in 1996 by receiving Association of Western Thrace Turks in the UK on board.
Mission.
Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe (ABTTF) aims for solution of the problems of the Turkish Minority of Western Thrace in Greece which can be achieved through an inclusive minority policy driven by respect and recognition of fundamental rights and freedoms. To this end, ABTTF is independent of political parties, state authorities and governments. Established in Germany and recognized as an international civil society organization, ABTTF pursues its activities in line with German federal laws.
While associations established locally by the Minority in Western Thrace serve the Turkish minority to maintain its social and cultural identity, Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe (ABTTF), as the officially recognised international representative of the Minority, promotes solution of judicial, political, economical and socio-cultural problems the Western Thrace Turks face in their daily lives in Greece.
ABTTF furthermore strives for equal treatment and non-discirimination of the Minority both in Greece and in the immigrated countries.
An essential mission assumed by the Federation is raisining awarenes of politicians and representatives throughout Europe that Turkish Minority of Western Thrace in Greece face severe violations of minority and human rights on a regular basis. ABTTF tries to induce Greece to cease respective violations and remind the signatory states of the Treaty of Lausanne to comply with the obligations laid out in the treaty's stipulations.
International recognition.
In 2006, the "Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe" has been accredited as a non-governmental organization (NGO) by the United Nations. On May 10, 2006, the UN Committee on Non-governmental Organizations recommended the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to grant consultative status to ABTTF and 21 other NGOs which led to ABTTF's accreditation in July 2006. This status allows the organization to participate in international meetings of the United Nations as speaker and to set up a representative office at the UN's main sites in New York, Vienna, and Geneva.
Furthermore, the "Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe" is full member of the Federal Union of European Nationalities (FUEN). In 2008, ABTTF has been a founding party of Fundamental Rights Platform (FRP) of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) and in the same year it became an active member of the European Dialogue Forum which is the committee that contacts the European Parliament in concern of issues about traditional national minorities, constitutional regions and regional languages.

George Bullock (British Army officer)

Sir George Mackworth Bullock KCMG, KCB, was an officer of the British Army. He served during the First World War, rising to the rank of lieutenant general, and was also the one-hundred and eighth Governor, Commander-in-Chief and Vice Admiral of Bermuda. 
After serving as a general officer, he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda, a strategic colony (now described as a British Overseas Territory) in the North Atlantic Ocean, in 1912, serving in this post until 1917. He was preceded by Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Kitchener, brother of Field-Marshal Lord Kitchener of Khartoum.
Sir George is remembered as moving Government House to the centre of Bermuda's social life. The British Government saw Bermuda more as a base than as a colony. Since the American War of Independence, the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda had served as the headquarters of the Royal Navy in the western North Atlantic, and a large garrison, the Bermuda Garrison, had been built up to defend it. Vast sums had been spent in the 19th century on fortifying the islands, and its governors were appointed almost exclusively from the general officers of the British Army, especially from the Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery.
Sir George's predecessors had kept a distance from Bermuda's civilian population, but he made efforts to interact socially, opening Government House to prominent Bermudians and visitors, such as US President-elect Woodrow Wilson, for social functions. He also made efforts to take part in the normal social life of the colony.
When Britain declared war on Germany in 1914, during the First World War, Sir George was temporarily overseas. The commanding officer of the Second Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment (2 Lincolns), based at Prospect Camp, Lieutenant-Colonel George Bunbury McAndrew, found himself acting governor, Commander-In-Chief, and Vice-Admiral of Bermuda in his absence, and oversaw the colony's placement onto a war footing. The battalion returned to England on 3 October 1914, and was sent to the Western Front soon after. 
A contingent from the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC) was detached in December 1914 to train for the Front. It was hoped this could join 2 Lincolns, but when it arrived in England 2 Lincolns was already in France. it was attached as an extra company to the First Battalion (1 Lincolns) instead, and was the first colonial volunteer unit to reach the Western Front when it arrived there in June, 1915. The contingent had trained at Warwick Camp, in Bermuda, over the winter of 1914-1915. As the BVRC still had to meet its obligations as part of the garrison, maintaining patrols and guarding key points around the archipelago, it did not have enough officers to provide an Adjutant to the cadre. Sir George filled this role himself, a job normally performed by a captain. The contingent, as a result, was popularly known as "Bullock's Boys".
Sir George retired from the governorship in 1917, being succeeded by General Sir James Willcocks.

Assens station

Assens railway station was the terminus of the Tommerup-Assens railway line, connecting the town of Assens with the Funen Main Line on the island of Funen in central Denmark.
History and design.
The station opened along with the other stations on the Tommerup-Assens line in 1884. It was built to a design by Niels Peder Christian Holsøe who had become head architect of the Danish State Railways in 1880. Prior to his appointment, Holsøe had developed a standardized building, consisting of a high central section flanked by two lower shoulders, in a romanticizing Neo-Romanesque style. This design was introduced with the construction of Strib railway station in 1860. At Assens, it was expanded with two low towers in Italian style. Holsøe also designed a new post office which was built next to the station.
The station came out of use when the Tommerup–Assens line was closed to passenger traffic in 1965.

Ridgeland-Hardeeville High School

Ridgeland-Hardeeville High School or RHHS is a public high school within the Jasper County School District, located in Ridgeland, South Carolina. The high school serves students in all of Jasper County and takes its name after the two major communities in the county, Ridgeland and Hardeeville. 
The school was formed in 2012 following the consolidation of "Hardeeville High School" and "Ridgeland High School" as part of the JCSD's overall reorganization of schools. RHHS utilizes the facilities of the former Ridgeland High School, whereas Hardeeville-Ridgeland Middle School utilizes the facilities of the former Hardeeville High School.
History.
In the post-segregation era, Jasper County made efforts to control costs by consolidating educational facilities. Prior to 2007, all secondary students attended "Jasper County High School" which was located in close proximity to RHHS. In 2007, the Jasper County School District opened two K-12 facilities in both Hardeeville and Ridgeland, thus creating Hardeeville High School and Ridgeland High School in anticipation of future population growth. However due to the economic slowdown beginning in 2008 and limited AP course offerings at both facilities, JCSD decided to merge the two middle schools and two high schools for the 2012-2013 school year. 
Critics of the merger have pointed to potentially long bus rides for students from various points of the county. Other critics suggested that the consolidation of the schools was prompted due to rumors that the State of South Carolina was about to take over the operation of the failing Ridgeland Middle School and the creation of Hardeeville-Ridgeland Middle School (by consolidation) would prevent the takeover.
Academics.
According to data released by the South Carolina Department of Education, Ridgeland-Hardeeville High School earned a "F" letter grade for the 2012-2013 school year, substantially below academic expectations put forth by the state in standardized testing and graduation accomplishment.
Athletics.
Ridgeland-Hardeeville's teams are known as the Jaguars, which was the previous mascot for Ridgeland High School. RHHS competes at the Class AA level in the South Carolina High School League.

Pat Murphy (director)

Pat Murphy (born 1951) is an Irish feminist filmmaker and lecturer, the director of Maeve (1982), Anne Devlin (1984) and Nora (2000).
Studies.
Born in Dublin, Murphy graduated from the Ulster College of Art and Design, followed by a BA in fine art at Hornsey College of Art and an MA in film and television from the Royal College of Art in London where she studied under feminist theorist Laura Mulvey. Hoping to train as a cinematographer, in 1977 she was the first European to achieve a scholarship year at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, influencing her decision to become a director. She completed a short film, Rituals of Memory, before returning to Ireland to work on her first feature film.
Early career.
Co-directed with John Davies but generally attributed to Murphy, Maeve (1981) was funded by the British Film Institute and later judged by Irish Times film critic Tara Brady to be "Ireland's first bona-fide feminist film." In 2012, Murphy recalled her approach: "I didn't think about story. I'd think something like: representations of Northern Ireland are unsatisfactory: I'm going to make Maeve and sort it all out... Maeve was asking how does a woman position herself against the background of what was going on in the North and within the history of republicanism and memory and landscape... I was influenced by Luc Godard and Brecht." The film's narrative and timeline meander far from the linear throughout.
Murphy's second film, "Anne Devlin", was a less cut-up affair, with the filmmaker working from the prison diaries of 19th Century Irish revolutionary Robert Emmet's housekeeper to rediscover her life and times. "I was amazed by how cinematic it was. Scenes were described in enough detail to construct shots for the movie. I think after making Maeve I became more interested in story. And with Anne Devlin's journal I wanted to tell a story that was like a ballad". It represented Ireland at international festivals such as Edinburgh, Moscow, Chicago, Toronto and London.
In 1987, Murphy was a founder board member of the Filmbase facility in Dublin's Temple Bar. The following year saw her write and co-direct the two-part documentary Sean MacBride Remembers, an exploration of the Irish republican and Nobel Peace Prize winner. She then turned her hand to a mixture of artistic disciplines: in theatre, with The Parade of Innocence and The River Parade (1989), in fine art practice and curatorship with the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA), in installation with a 1992 film for the Strokestown Famine Museum, and 1993 saw her co-direct Reflections from the Roof of the World.
Nora.
Her most recent feature film was Nora (2000), a study of writer James Joyce's partner Nora Barnacle, with Susan Lynch in the lead role and Ewan McGregor as Joyce. After researching Joyce in the hope of filming an element of his life or work, Murphy found an appropriate point of entry through Brenda Maddox's biography of Barnacle, which "points out how the all-pervasiveness of Nora's voice in Joyce's writing has paradoxically rendered her invisible to the reader," she explained. The film earned her the United International Pictures Director's Award and a slew of Irish Film and Television Awards. To date, the it is her only film that remains generally available.
In 2002, Murphy made the short film What Mira Saw and the following year was elected a member of Irish artists' group Aosdána, at which point she taught film at Queen's University Belfast and sat on the board of the Screen Directors' Guild of Ireland.
In 2012, Murphy's three major films were included in The Sunday Times' list of the top 100 Irish films of all time. That July, they were presented along with a public interview in a retrospective at the Irish Film Institute in Dublin. She is preparing a documentary on Muslim weavers and since the release of Nora was reported to have lectured in Singapore for three years and travelled around India for ten. She is an Associate Arts Professor at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, Asia graduate film programme.

History.
The Squadron was formed on 16 October 1965, as an Air Defence unit, under Wing Commander E.R. Fernandes. It was to be equipped with Folland Gnats, but relied on Gnats borrowed form 2 Squadron, and 18 Squadron, until 14 May 1966, when it got its first batch of Gnats.

The squadron was commanded by Wing Commander S.S. Malik, who was also designated Air Defence Commander of the sector. The Station Commander at Uttarlai was Wing Commander V.K. Murthy.
The men of the squadron were initially housed in tents. Subsequently they were housed in the underground ATC. As word spread that Pakistani Commandos were seen in the sand, the men had to take turns doing night patrols. Soldiers could only have a bath every alternate day, and had six hundred rounds of ammunition with which they had to hunt goose for food.
Operations.
On 3 December, a Pakistani Canberra, dropped eight bombs on the runway, making it unsuitable for use. However using civilian labour, the squadron cleared out the parallel taxi track. Thereafter only the track was used for take-off and landing. During the war, the squadron flew a total of 109 sorties, most of which were Combat Air patrols.
The first bit of action it saw was on the morning of 10 December. Squadron Leader Kale, and Flying Officer P. Ajit were flying a CAP, when they spotted two F-104 Starfighters. they engaged the planes, but failed to do damage, and had their runway bombed. A little later, the base was given a P-12 Radar, causing the Pakistani Air Force to avoid Uttarlai.
On 13 December six of their aircraft were moved to Ahmedabad to defend Ankleshwar Oil Refinery, and later four of these aircraft were to be moved to Srinagar. However they were informed of the ceasefire when they reached Pathankot, and flew back to Gorkhapur.
Post-War Era.
The squadron won a number of trophies in gunnery meets, and was visited by the then Air Chief Marshall Arjan Singh, and Air Vice Marshall H. Mulgavkar. 
In 1975, the squadron moved to Bakshi ka Talab, and operated there till 1 December 1976, when it was reloated to AFS Pune, and re-quipped with MiG 21 BIS. During this time three officers were awarded the Vayu Sena Medal.
The squadron was tasked with helping other squadrons with the conversion to MiG 21 BIS, Within the first year, 46 pilots had been converted. On 24 September 1977, Air Chief Marshall Mulgavkar visited the squadron. In June 1978, the first accident with a MiG 21 in the IAF took place. The nose of an aircraft sheared off on landing during a night sortie. 
By June 1979, they had converted 11 more pilots. On 18 October, Wing Commander S.A.B. Naidu took over command of the squadron from Wing Commander D.N. Rathore (VrC, VM). Naidu was awarded Central Air Command Commendation on 26 January 1980. During this period the squadron took part in several exercises, Exercise Ranbheru, Exercise Agnivarsha, and the CAC Weapons Meet, alongside 4 Forward Base Support Unit, Exercise Ajinkya at 5 Wing, and Exercise Hamla conducted by South Western Air Command. In February 1980, the Squadron won the team event and R/P event for CAC.
From 1981 to 1982, the squadron strived to achieve higher standards, and participated in several air-to-air missile and gun-firing exercises, such as Exercise Vajraghat-III, Exercise Chaukanna-III and IV. By 19 May 1982, the squadron had achieved 100% serviceability, and all the aircraft were flown that day.

The business was founded in 1893 by Ernest Petrucci as a wine and spirits store, Petrucci's Wines & Brandies, that also sold groceries. Its location at 488 Ninth Avenue near 37th Street was on a stretch of the avenue that remained lined with exotic food stores for decades. After the enactment of Prohibition in the U.S. in 1919, Petrucci's nephew James Manganaro, an immigrant from Naples, took over the store in the 1920s and changed the name; in 1927 he was able to buy the building. Manganaro may have invented the hero sandwich, and played a role in introducing it to Americans. On his death in 1953, Manganaro's passed to his brother Louis and sister Nina Manganaro Dell'Orto and their spouses; in 1955, with a publicity agent's help, they invented the six-foot "Hero-Boy" sandwich, which was successful enough for one of Dell'Orto's four sons to go on the original version of the TV quiz show "I've Got a Secret", and for the family to open a sandwich shop next door at 492–494 Ninth Avenue the following year, while continuing to operate a deli and lunch counter in the rear of the grocery store. In 1962 Louis Manganaro retired and two of his four nephews took over the grocery store and the other two the sandwich shop, Manganaro's Hero-Boy, and the businesses were separated.
Sal Dell'Orto, who bought out his brother's half ownership of the grocery store, and James Dell'Orto, who bought out his brother's half ownership of the sandwich shop, fell out over rights to the "Manganaro's Hero-Boy" name, trademarked by the sandwich shop in 1969, and advertising for party sandwich hot-lines, which led to two separate court cases. The business' neon sign installed in the early 1930s, which became blinking in the 1960s, was turned off in 2000 so that Manganaro's Hero-Boy could not benefit from it. The grocery store was repeatedly found at fault over the hot-line and was ordered to pay damages to the sandwich shop, and the financial drain plus waning popularity, some of it due to the declining neighborhood, led to the decision to sell the building and close. This was first announced early in 2011, but the building was withdrawn from the market; the business then closed in late February 2012.
Anthony Bourdain featured the store (and its famously brusque service) in an episode of "" in 2009.

Pseudo-runes

Pseudo-runes are letters that look like Germanic runes but are not true runes. The term is not precise, and has been used with several different meanings. 
Imitation runes.
The main use of the term pseudo-rune is in reference to epigraphic inscriptions using letters that imitate the appearance of runes, but which cannot be read as runes. These are different from cryptic or magical runic inscriptions comprising a seemingly random jumble of runic letters, which cannot be interpreted by modern scholars, but can at least be read. In contrast, pseudo-runic inscriptions consist mostly of false letters (some pseudo-runes within a pseudo-runic inscription may coincidentally appear similar or identical to true runes), and so cannot be read at all, even nonsensically.
It has been suggested that pseudo-runic inscriptions were not made by specialist 'rune masters' as is thought to have been the case when carving traditional runic inscriptions, but were made by artisans who were largely ignorant of runes. According to Nowell Myres, pseudo-runes may have been "intended to impress the illiterate as having some arcane significance".
Manuscript-only runes.
The term pseudo-rune has also been used by R. I. Page to refer to runic letters that only occur in manuscripts and are not attested in any extant runic inscription, for example the Anglo-Saxon runes "cweorth" (q), "ior" (io), and "stan" (st).
Latin script written in runic-like letters.
In modern usage, Latin text written with deliberately rune-like, angular letters has been described as pseudo-runic. For example, members of the Norwegian Legion who served on the Eastern Front during World War II had a badge with the word 'Frontkjemper' (front fighter) written in rune-like letters.
Other rune-like scripts.
Other unrelated scripts that resemble runes, for example the Old Turkic and Old Hungarian scripts, have sometimes been referred to as pseudo-runes or pseudo-runic.

Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Company

Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court interpreted the Federal Power Act (FPA) as permitting the Federal Power Commission (FPC) to modify a rate specified in a contract between an electric utility and distribution company only upon a finding that the contract rate is unlawful because it adversely affects the public interest. "Sierra Pacific" and its companion case "United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp." established the "Mobile-Sierra" doctrine, which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be "just and reasonable" and thus acceptable under the FPA or Natural Gas Act (NGA).
Background.
The Federal Water Power Act was amended in 1935 and renamed the FPA and reorganized the FPC. It also regulated all interstate transmission of electricity. Under the FPA, a power company could establish a rate by either filing a new rate schedule thirty days prior to its effective date or by filing a contract with a wholesale customer. The FPC could suspend a newly filed rate and establish an administrative proceeding to investigate it for its reasonableness, and it could investigate filed contracts to determine if they were unlawful.
The Sierra Pacific Power Company distributed electricity in northern Nevada and eastern California and purchased the majority of its power from a California electric utility, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), which was subject to regulation under the FPA. In 1947, because of increased post-war power demand and consumer desire for less expensive electricity, Sierra Pacific began negotiating for new supplies, including with the Bureau of Reclamation, which had excess capacity available from the recently completed Shasta Dam. PG&E then offered Sierra Pacific a fifteen-year power supply contract, which Sierra Pacific accepted in June 1948.
In early 1953 after excess power from the Shasta Dam was no longer available, PG&E without the consent of Sierra Pacific filed a new rate schedule with the FPC purporting to increase the rate to Sierra Pacific by 28%. The FPC suspended the rate until September 6, 1953, and initiated an administrative proceeding to determine the reasonableness of the new rate. Sierra Pacific intervened but its motion to reject the new rate because the contract could not be changed without its consent was rejected by the FPC. In 1954 the FPC issued an order upholding its decision not to reject the new rate and finding it to be not "unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential." On appeal by Sierra Pacific, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, holding that the contract rate could only be changed upon a finding that it was unreasonable, reversed the FPC order and remanded it without prejudice to the FPC initiating a new proceeding to determine the reasonableness of the contract rate. The Supreme Court granted certiorari because of the importance of the case to the administration of the FPA.
Opinion.
The unanimous opinion by Justice Harlan noted two issues in the case. First, since the relevant provisions of the FPA are substantially equivalent to those of the NGA, the Court held that, under the holding of "Mobile Gas", the filing of a new rate schedule and the proceeding to review it was not effective to supersede the contract rate. "Mobile Gas" held that the NGA did not authorize a unilateral contract change, and that holding also applied to the FPA.
Secondly, the FPA also allows the FPC to set aside a contract upon a determination that the rate is unlawful. The parties during the FPC proceeding had stipulated that a reasonable or fair rate of return (ROR) for PG&E was 5.5%, and that the contract rate provided a ROR of 2.6% while the new filed rate schedule provided a ROR of 4.75%, which was the lowest that PG&E stated it would accept. The FPC had in its order found that the 1948 contract rate to be unreasonably low and unlawful because of its low ROR. The Supreme Court, however, noted that while a regulatory agency such as the FPC may not normally impose upon a public utility a ROR that is less than the fair ROR, it did not follow that the public utility may not itself agree by contract to a ROR that is less than the fair ROR, or that if it does so, that it is entitled to regulatory relief of its improvident bargain. Under the FPA, the proper standard for determining whether a contract rate is unlawful is whether the rate is so low as to adversely affect the public interest, such as having been unduly discriminatory to third parties, excessively burdensome to consumers, or a threat to continued service to the utility company.
Subsequent events.
The Supreme Court in its companion case "Mobile Gas" found a similar result regarding contracts filed with the FPC involving electricity sales under the NGA. In later cases, the validity of rates set by contracts between gas and electric transmission companies became known as the "Mobile"-"Sierra" doctrine. Under this doctrine, an electricity or gas rate specified in a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be “just and reasonable” and thus acceptable under the FPA or NGA.
On October 1, 1977, the FPC was replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In "Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. v. Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County" (2008), the Supreme Court determined that the "Mobile"-"Sierra" doctrine also applied when the burden of the improvident contract was on the purchaser. The case was remanded to determine if the contract negotiated during the California electricity crisis of 2000-2001 was the result of market manipulation, which would eliminate one premise on which the "Mobile"-"Sierra" doctrine rests: that the contract rates are the product of fair, arms-length negotiations.

The Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures provides the following information about Al-Hashimi:
"Alī ibn Sulaymān al-Hāshimī flourished some time in the second half of the ninth century, probably somewhere in the central lands of Islam. Virtually nothing is known about him other than the fact that he wrote a rather uncritical work on zījes (astronomical handbooks) that nevertheless preserves a great deal of otherwise unknown or little known information. This book, "Kitābfi ilal al-zījāt" (Explanation of Zījes), was written at a time before Ptolemaic astronomy had become the dominant astronomical tradition in Eastern Islam. As such, it contains considerable material about the Indian and Persian astronomical traditions, at least insofar as they were received and preserved during this early period of Islamic science."

Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve

Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve (, the official long name The State museum-reserve of Alexander Pushkin «Mikhailovskoye») is a museum complex dedicated to Alexander Pushkin, a Russian poet considered to be the founder of modern literary Russian language. The museum is located in Pushkinogorsky District of Pskov Oblast in Northwestern Russia, in the areas around the settlement of Pushkinskiye Gory and in the surrounding villages including Mikhaylovskoye, where Pushkin had a family estate.
History.
In 1742, the land around the village of Mikhaylovskoye was granted to Abram Petrovich Gannibal by empress Elizabeth. Pushkin's mother, Nadezhda Osipovna Pushkina (Gannibal), was a granddaughter of Abram Gannibal. Pushkin was visiting the estate on a regular basis, and between 1824 and 1826 he was also exiled there. He was killed on a duel in January 1837 in Saint Petersburg and was buried in Svyatogorsky Monastery in what is now Pushkinskiye Gory. The estate remained in the family until 1899, when the state bought it from Grigory Pushkin, a son of Alexanfer Pushkin.
An unsuccessful attempt to open a small-scale museum was made in 1911, and subsequently during the October Revolution in 1917 the estate was burnt down. On March 17, 1922 Mikhaylovskoye, Trigorskoye, and the tomb of Pushkin in Svyatogorsky Monastery were declared a state monument and opened as a museum (the Pushkin Museum Reserve). In 1936, the whole Svyatogorsky Monastery was added, as well as the estate of Petrovskoye, which formerly belonged to Pushkin's uncle, and adjacent areas. The museum was looted and badly damaged during World War II; after the war, extensive restoration work was undertaken.
In 1992, the monastery was transferred to the property of Russian Orthodox Church, and in 1995, the museum was renamed Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve. It was further expanded in the same year.

Wellington Amateurs F.C. is an English football club located in Telford, in Shropshire. The club plays in the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division. After many years in the Wellington League, the team was promoted to the Shropshire County Football League. They were promoted to the West Midlands (Regional) League in 2006. Wellington won Division One three times in four seasons and gained promotion to the Premier Division for 2012–13.
History.
The club was formed in 1950 as Old Wellingtonians by former students of Wellington Grammar School. The name was later changed to the current one when Head Master of the school discovered that the club had started accepting players that were not former pupils. After 31 years in the Wellington League, the club joined the Shropshire County Football League Division One in 1981. In their inaugural season, Wellington won the league and cup double, gaining promotion to the Premier Division. They won the Premier Division in 1982–83 and 1988–89, and finished runners-up in 2005–06, allowing them to apply for membership of the West Midlands (Regional) League Division Two. Wellington won the league in their second season and gained promotion to Division One. Despite winning the league in 2008–09 and 2009–10, they were not promoted due to their ground not being up to standard. After ground improvements, and winning the league in 2011–12, Wellington were promoted to the Premier Division.

Black's approximation

In finance, Black's approximation is an approximate method for computing the value of an American call option on a stock paying a single dividend. It was described by Fischer Black in 1975.
Background.
The Black–Scholes formula provides an explicit equation for the value of a call option on a non-dividend paying stock. In case the stock pays one or more discrete dividend(s) no closed formula is known, but several approximations can be used, or else the Black–Scholes PDE will have to be solved numerically. One such approximation is described here.
The method.
Use the BS formula to compute the value of two European call options: 
(1) A European call with the same maturity as the American call being valued, but with the stock price reduced by the present value of the dividend, and 
(2) A European call that expires on the day before the dividend is to be paid. 
Now take the largest of the two values (1) and (2) above as the desired Black's approximation for the American call.
The resulting value is sometimes called the "pseudo American" value of the call.
Example.
Consider an American call option with ex-dividend dates in 3 months and 5 months. The dividend on each ex-dividend date is expected to payout $0.70. Additional information is presented below. Find the value of the American call option.
First, we need to calculate based on the two methods provided above in the methods section. Here we will calculate both of the parts:
(1) This is the first method calculation which states:
(2) This is the second method calculation which states:
So, recalling method (1) price of formula_27 from method (2), we see that the price of the American call option, as per Fisher Black's approximation, is the greater of the two methods, therefore, the price of the option = formula_28.

<doc id="36552524" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36552524" title="Amaryllis (ship)">
Amaryllis (ship)

Amaryllis was a cargo ship built in 1945 at Burrard Dry Dock in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She was long and measured 7,147 gross register tons. Originally named Cromwell Park, she was built for the government of Canada to be used in World War II. In 1946 she was sold to Canadian Transportation Co. Ltd. which renamed her the Harmac Vancouver. In 1948, she was sold to Greek shipowner Kydoniefs, renamed the "Amaryllis" and registered in Panama. In 1965, she ran aground during Hurricane Betsy off the coast of Florida and was later sunk offshore as an artificial reef at 
Grounding.
As Hurricane Betsy approached the east coast of Florida on September 7, 1965, "Amaryllis", bound from Manchester, England to Baton Rouge, Louisiana with a Greek crew of 30, sought refuge in the Port of Palm Beach in Riviera Beach, Florida. As she approached the Palm Beach Inlet from the Atlantic Ocean into the port, she suffered steering problems in addition to the high winds and seas, which resulted in her being forced into the shallow waters laced with coral reefs north of the inlet. Sometime during the night of September 7–8, she ran aground on the Singer Island beach in front of the Rutledge Motel, later known as the Rutledge Inn, in Riviera Beach. During the next day the winds and seas increased as Hurricane Betsy made her landfall to the south in Key Largo; this pounding wedged the ship farther onto the beach.
The ship almost immediately became an attraction for sightseers and locals, who came to view her and listen to her Greek crew strum their musical instruments. She soon became a magnet for surfers. None of the Greek crewmen spoke English; a local interpreter was required for the Coast Guard to communicate with the sightseers. All of the crew except for two who jumped ship,and were later picked up in Memphis, remained on the ship until November when her owners made arrangements for them to leave the country.
After several unsuccessful salvage attempts by the original owners and a Miami man who bought her from them, the ship was abandoned and became a menace to those people daring enough to board and wander through her, as well as a concern for the motel owner whose guests were annoyed by the sightseers and kept awake at night by clanging noises from the ship. Oil seepage fouled the water and beach and one fire broke out on the ship. Local residents and officials became concerned about the danger of further damage to the coral reef by the ship as well as the discharge of large quantities of bunker oil from the ship if she broke up.
The Army Corps of Engineers became involved in dismantling the ship and removing the oil. On August 22, 1968, her remains were "towed three-fourths of a mile out to sea and sunk in of water" to create an artificial reef. Cleanup of the beach and removal of debris from the ship took over a year.
In the media.
"Amaryllis" was used as a backdrop in the 1967–1968 daytime game show "Treasure Isle" hosted by John Bartholomew Tucker. The show was actually shot a mile or so south of the ship at John D. MacArthur's Colonnades Beach Hotel in Palm Beach Shores.
