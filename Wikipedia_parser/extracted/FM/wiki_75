Lomitapide

Lomitapide (INN, marketed as Juxtapid in the US and as Lojuxta in the EU) is a drug for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia, developed by Aegerion Pharmaceuticals.
It has been tested in clinical trials as single treatment and in combinations with atorvastatin, ezetimibe and fenofibrate.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lomitapide on 21 December 2012, as an orphan drug to reduce LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).
On 31 May 2013 the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion with a unanimous vote recommending a marketing authorization for lomitapide. On 31 July 2013 the European Commission approved lomitapide as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering medicinal products with or without low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis in adult patients with HoFH.
Mechanism of action.
Lomitapide inhibits the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP or MTTP) which is necessary for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and secretion in the liver.
On 24 December 2012, drug manufacturer Aegerion announced they had been approved by the FDA to as "an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering treatments...in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)."
Side effects.
In a Phase III study, lomitapide lead to elevated aminotransferase levels and fat accumulation in the liver.

Claudio Brindis de Salas Garrido

Claudio Brindis de Salas Garrido ("Claudio José Domingo Brindis de Salas Garrido", Havana, Cuba, 4 August 1852 – Buenos Aires, Argentina 1 June 1911) was a Cuban concert violinist. His father was the violinist and bandleader, Claudio Brindis de Salas. The son surpassed his father, and was a violinist of world renown. He studied under his father, and then with maestros José Redondo and the Belgian José Van der Gutch (who lived in Havana). In 1863 he first performed in public, in Havana, with Van der Gutch as accompanist. Ignacio Cervantes also played at the same function.
In 1864 he toured with his father and his brother José del Rosario in the Cuban cities of Matanzas, Cárdenas, Cienfuegos and Güines; in 1869 to Veracruz, México. He went from México to Paris, to study under Hubert Léonard and Charles Dancla, and gained entry to Conservatoire de Paris, where he won first prize in 1871. He then toured Florence, Turin and Milan, where he played at La Scala. His tours in Europe brought great critical and public enthusiasm. 
In 1875 he returned to the Americas, and was appointed director of the "Conservatoire de Haiti". He played in Cuba in Havana (1878) and Santiago de Cuba, then to Veracruz again and México City, where he performed Mendelssohn's Concerto for violin and orchestra. In later years he played in St Petersberg (1881), New York (1887), Barcelona (1889), Santo Domingo (1895), San Juan, Puerto Rico, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago (1996), Tenerife (1902), Ronda, Spain (1911), and ended his career in Argentina.
Claudio composed a few works, but he was primarily a concert performer, and to judge from critical notices, one of the best in the world at that time. Carpentier called him ""the most extraordinary of the black musicians of the nineteenth century... an unprecedented case in the musical history of the continent"".
The French government made him a member of the Légion d'Honneur, and gave him the title of "Baron". In Buenos Aires he was given a genuine Stradivarius; when he stayed in Berlin, he married a German woman, was appointed chamber musician to the Emperor, and became a German citizen. He died in 1911, now in poverty, from tuberculosis in Buenos Aires. In 1930 his remains were transferred to Havana with great honours.

UniversalCTI

Traditionally, computer telephony integration (CTI) integrates a telecom system, IT infrastructure, and software application(s) with relevant and/or target customer data. This integration is typically difficult to use and requires a significant level of sophistication. 
The primary business purpose of Universal CTI is to provide a software bridge between the various computers and telephone systems in call center environments. Applications made possible by Universal CTI include screen pop, coordinated call-data transfer between agents and interactive voice response (IVR) integration, which transfers caller-entered IVR information to agent desktop workstations. By integrating computers and telephone systems, Universal CTI applications allow call centers to realize significant advances in both agent productivity and quality of customer service. The service oriented architecture of Universal CTI provides a WSDL (web services based) interface for agent desk top applications or self-service (IVR) applications to communicate to the CTI Server (Genesys T-Server/CISCO ICM/ Avaya AES) in a given call center.
In the commonly encountered open environment, a call center solution may consist of multiple CTI servers in disparate locations from multiple vendors running multiple applications simultaneously. Currently, in such a real life situation, it's no longer possible to develop applications with custom interfaces to each one of these CTI servers, maintain the applications, and change applications as business requirements change without a dedicated staff to manage the various CTI interfaces.
Components.
The Universal CTI consists of following components:
1. WSDL: These are the Access-Points that provide the connectivity between the applications and the CTI Services. 
2. Configuration and Administration: The user can configure new connectors to communicate to different CTI engines and monitor the connections through this module. 
3. Reporting: UCTI provides report generation facility for user login & logout time including creation, deletion or any alteration time of connectors. Also, WSDL access analysis report can be obtained on per connector and method basis including average response time for connector.

<doc id="21559940" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21559940" title="Animal spirits (Keynes)">
Animal spirits (Keynes)

Animal spirits is the term John Maynard Keynes used in his 1936 book "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" to describe the instincts, proclivities and emotions that ostensibly influence and guide human behavior, and which can be measured in terms of, for example, consumer confidence. It has since been argued that trust is also included in or produced by "animal spirits". 
Origins.
Several articles and at least two books with a focus on "animal spirits" were published in 2008 and 2009 as a part of the "Keynesian resurgence".
The original passage by Keynes reads:
William Safire published an article "On Language: 'Animal Spirits'” in the "New York Times" on March 10, 2009, stating:
It has also been suggested that Keynes may be referring to David Hume's term for spontaneous motivation although it is not mentioned in the "Treatise of Human Nature". The term itself is drawn from the Latin "spiritus animales" which may be interpreted as the spirit (or fluid) that drives human thought, feeling, and action.
Earlier uses.
"Animal spirits" was a euphemistic late-Victorian and Edwardian phrase used by English public schoolboys such as P. G. Wodehouse (born two years before the Etonian Keynes) who attended Dulwich College. Wodehouse and Arthur Conan Doyle were popular authors for public school boys in England before the Great War. Doyle himself used the phrase "animal spirits" in 1883, the year of Keynes's birth. 
Two examples of Wodehouse's use of the phrase are in the 1909 book "Mike" (later republished in two parts as "Mike at Wrykyn" and "Mike and Psmith"). "Animal spirits" denoted an adolescent attitude to authority that resulted in energetically and deliberately acting on advice, opinion, or exhortation to the point of stretching the letter of any regulations involved to the limit. The aim was to maximise short-term disruption of what was considered to be 'normal' behaviour. Restoring equilibrium subsequently required a firm sanction from those in authority and possibly also a re-casting of the regulation to prevent repeats of the actions undertaken. The slang term of the era for this was 'ragging'. 
Wodehouse uses antithesis in the latter example to make comedy out of Mr. Downing's astonishment; surely nobody could be "less" susceptible to "animal spirits" than the suave, debonaire Psmith? "Psmith In The City" (1910) was based on Wodehouse's own experiences in the 'square mile' and the theme is implicitly elaborated on in the financial environment of the "New Asiatic Bank".
John Coates of Cambridge University supports the popular English Edwardian public school intuition that qualities such as dynamism and leadership coexist with less constructive traits such as recklessness, heedlessness, and in-caution. Coates attributes this to fluctuations in hormonal balances; abnormally high levels of testosterone may create individual success but also collective excessive aggression, overconfidence, and herd behaviour, while too much cortisol can promote irrational pessimism and risk aversion. The author's remedy for this is to shift the employment balance in finance towards women and older men and monitor traders' biology.
In 2009 Akerlof and Shiller advised in addition that:

Sydney Walter Robinson

Sir Sydney Walter Robinson JP (1876 – 17 November 1950) was an English farmer, building contractor and Liberal politician.
Family and education.
Sydney Robinson was born in 1876 in Walthamstow which was then in the county of Essex, the son of Alfred and Georgina Robinson. He was educated in Walthamstow but then travelled to the USA where he studied at the Metropolitan College in Chicago. In 1898 he married Gwendolene Edith King.
Career.
Robinson had business interests as a building contractor and was also a farmer with land near to Chelmsford. His speciality and success was in the breeding of pedigree shorthorn dairy cows but this as much for agricultural shows as for profit. Robinson served as a Justice of the Peace for the county of Essex. He was also a Freeman of the City of London.
Politics.
Local Politics.
In local politics, Robinson was a member of Essex County Council for 30 years and was an Alderman of the council. He chaired the Public Health Committee. He was knighted in 1934. He served as a Vice-President of the Home Counties Liberal Federation.
Parliamentary politics.
1918-1923.
Robinson stood for Parliament eight times in all. He first contested Essex South East at the 1918 general election but lost his deposit in a three-cornered fight with the successful Coalition Conservative and Labour Party candidates. He next contested Chelmsford in Essex at the 1922 general election coming second to the Conservative Member of Parliament for the constituency since 1908, E. G. Pretyman, with Labour in third. He fought Chelmsford again in 1923 this time in a straight fight with Pretyman. The absence of a Labour candidate and recent industrial developments around Chelmsford enhanced Robinson's chances of success and he duly recorded the only success of his Parliamentary career, winning with a majority of 2,692 votes. This was the first time since its creation for the 1885 general election that Chelmsford had returned a Liberal MP.
1923-1924.
During his time in Parliament Robinson was best known for his introduction of a Bill to include farm workers in the National Unemployed Insurance scheme. During the 1924 general election the Conservative Party enjoyed a revival of fortune nationally and Robinson could not hold his seat in a three-cornered contest with Tory and Labour opponents. He came second to the new Conservative candidate Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett with the Labour man, Major Nils Moller losing his deposit.
Chelmsford by-election, 1926.
Curtis-Bennett resigned his seat in 1926 for personal reasons in the wake of his marital problems, soon to end in divorce, citing great strain on his health. His resignation caused a by-election and Robinson again won the Liberal nomination. However in another three-cornered fight he again came second to the Conservative candidate.
1929-1945.
Robinson tried once more to regain Chelmsford, at the 1929 general election. He again came second in a three horse race, and although he increased his percentage of the poll, the Conservatives held the seat by a majority of 4,060 votes. In 1930 he announced that he would not contest the Chelmsford Division again and at the general election of 1931 Robinson switched his candidacy to the constituency of Walthamstow West. In an election held in the atmosphere of the formation of the National Government, despite the fact that his name was added to the Simonite Liberal National list, and in spite of his statements during the election that he was an ‘out and out supporter’ of the National Government, it was the Conservative rather than Robinson whose candidacy was identified as the most obvious advocate of the government of Ramsay MacDonald. Robinson found his vote squeezed between the Labour and Conservative parties. Labour retained the seat but the Tories jumped into second place over the Liberals. Robinson did not contest the 1935 general election but was prevailed upon to fight in 1945. He switched constituencies to Epping but, standing as a Liberal, he came a poor third behind the two main parties.
Death.
Robinson died on 17 November 1950 aged 74 years at his home at The Drive, Snaresbrook in Essex.

Creeper was an experimental self-replicating program written by Bob Thomas at BBN in 1971. It was designed not to damage but to demonstrate a mobile application. It is generally accepted to be the first computer virus. "Creeper" infected DEC PDP-10 computers running the TENEX operating system.The Reaper program was created by Ray Tomlinson to delete the Creeper program.
Reaper.
The Reaper program was a computer worm, like Creeper, but its purpose was to delete the latter.
This fact was an inspiration for Core War, the series "Hyperion" by Dan Simmons, especially later books "Endymion" and "The Rise of Endymion" and for the D-Reaper, the final enemy of Digimon Tamers.

The village of Leśno first appears in the records for the year 1342, in which Winrich von Kniprode, master of the Teutonic Knights, granted it to one "Dytryk" for services to be rendered. In the time of the Partitions, Leśno, like all of the surrounding region, became part of the Prussian Empire. From 1919 to 1939, during the Second Polish Republic, it was included as a part of Poland. After the German conquest of 1939 it was part of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. During the German occupation, the resistance organization Gryf Pomorski (English: "Pomeranian Griffin") maintained a radio station named "Budnik" ("Alarm Clock") in the nearby hamlet of Widno.
Kashubian Emigration to America.
Leśno has long been considered a part of the Kashubian culture. During the Kashubian diaspora, many families from Leśno such as the Bambenek (Bambeneks) and the Stoltmann (Sztoltmans), Spierewka (Sprouffske), Bielawa emigrated to the area of Winona, Minnesota in the United States, beginning in the late 1850s. 
For further details on the history of the region, see "History of Pomerania."
Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.
The Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in Leśno dates back as far as 1643 and has the highest wooden tower in Poland. First mentioned in 1534 as the church of Saint Katarzyna, the historical work "Ad Historiam Ecclesiasticam Pomeraniae" states that it was refounded and given its present name by Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga of Poland circa 1642.
Miraculously, the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross escaped major damage during the First and Second World Wars. Indeed, many of the antique fittings have been preserved and can be viewed today. In keeping with its architectural and cultural significance, the church has received careful restoration and renovations. In 1975 the altars, pulpit, and choral area were renewed. In 1993-1994, the roof and tower coverings were renewed.

Douglass Place

Douglass Place is a group of historic rowhouses located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Built in 1892, it represents typical "alley houses" of the period in Baltimore, two narrow bays wide, two stories high over a cellar, with shed roofs pitched to the rear. Italianate influence is reflected in their segmental-arched window and door openings, and in the simple molded sheet metal cornices which crown the buildings. Frederick Douglass (1818-1895) constructed the five buildings as rental housing for blacks in the Fells Point area of Baltimore, where he had resided from the 1820s to 1838. The site was the location of the Dallas Street Station Methodist Episcopal Church, which he had attended while living in the area.
Douglass Place was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Anti-Terrorist Unit (Liberia)

The Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU), also known as the Anti-Terrorist Brigade, was a paramilitary force of the government of Liberia, established by then-President Charles Taylor in 1997-98. Chuckie Taylor, Charles Taylor's son, served as commander of the force for a period. The ATU was initially organized ostensibly to protect government buildings, the executive mansion, the international airport, and to provide security for some foreign embassies. It was a special forces group consisting predominately of foreign nationals from Burkina Faso and The Gambia, as well as former Revolutionary United Front (RUF) combatants from Sierra Leone.
The ATU had no legal basis for its existence, and was not under the command of the Ministry of Defense. The ATU absorbed Taylor's most experienced NPFL civil war fighters, including undisciplined and untrained loyalists. Sam Bockarie (alias Mosquito), and Brig. Gen. Abu were named as being among the ATU’s senior personnel in a report issued in October 2001. According to a report from the UN Panel of Experts on Diamonds and Arms in Sierra Leone, issued in December 2000, a former SADF officer, Fred Rindel, trained up to 1200 ATU personnel between September 1998 and August 2000, when Rindel cancelled his contract following negative media attention.
During 2002 ATU members increasingly were involved in criminal activities such as theft, looting, and murder in Monrovia. More than in the past, the perpetrators were apprehended; however, cases against them remained unresolved at year's end. Two ATU members arrested in November 2001 after looting a private residence in Monrovia were released during 2002.
There were many unlawful killings by security forces during 2002. For example, on June 19, an ATU officer and presidential guards opened fire on a taxicab in Monrovia and killed a 6-year-old child and critically injured his mother and the driver. President Taylor ordered an investigation of the incident, which was ongoing at year's end. In September Lt. Isaac Gono, a driver attached to ATU chief Charles Taylor Jr.'s command, was beaten to death by his colleagues as a disciplinary measure for denting a vehicle. Two soldiers were arrested and held for court martial. The trial was opened; however, it later was suspended for unknown reasons, and the case was pending at year's end.
Former Deputy Minister of Labor Bedell Fahn and four members of the ATU arrested for torturing two Nigerian men to death in October 2001 were tried during 2002. Fahn was sentenced to 10 months in prison; however, in September he was released. Two ATU members were acquitted and the other two were sentenced to life imprisonment.
The National Transitional Government of Liberia disbanded the ATU, as part of Liberia's larger post-war demobilisation process.

TB9Cs1H2 snoRNA

TB9Cs1H2 is a member of the H/ACA-like class of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecule that guide the sites of modification of uridines to pseudouridines of substrate RNAs. It is known as a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) thus named because of its cellular localization in the nucleolus of the eukaryotic cell. TB9Cs1H2 is predicted to guide the pseudouridylation of SSU ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at residue Ψ1619.

Mutated citrullinated vimentin

Detection of autoantibodies against mutated citrullinated vimentin is part of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnostics, especially in sera negative for rheumatoid factor (RF negative sera). Anti-MCV antibodies are a member of the ACPA family, a group of the so-called antibodies to citrullinated protein/peptide antigens.
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder. Detection of specific autoantibodies (antibodies directed against the body’s own tissue) such as rheumatoid factors and ACPAs may provide indication of the disease. In many cases, autoimmune diagnostics are crucial for diagnosing RA correctly and already in the disease’s early stages, when typical symptoms often are lacking but when medical therapy is most effective.
Basics.
Citrullination is a modification of proteins where a nitrogen in the amino acid arginine is
replaced with an oxygen, converting it into citrulline. The modified (citrullinated) protein may be identified by as foreign, provoking an autoimmune inflammation response.
Various kinds of citrullinated proteins have been detected in the joints of RA patients. One of these is Sa antigen, now known as mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV).
Citrullination of vimentin plays a decisive role in RA pathogenesis.
Significance.
In rheumatology diagnostics, autoantibodies against mutated citrullinated vimentin (anti-MCV) are of prominent diagnostic and prognostic value. Their significance is greater than that of rheumatoid factor.
Recently a serological point-of-care test (POCT) for the early detection of RA has been developed. This assay combines the detection of rheumatoid factor and anti-MCV for diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and shows a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 99.7%.
Anti-MCV are used as efficient biomarkers for estimating progress of rheumatoid arthritis. Main advantage of testing for anti-MCV is the early appearance of the anti-MCV antibodies, what allows for detection of early RA and submits adequate therapy just after the disease’s onset. Moreover, anti-MCV titres show strong correlation to disease activity, disease severity and the success of therapy.

HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphant submarine collision

The submarines HMS "Vanguard" and "Le Triomphant" collided in the Atlantic Ocean in the night between 3–4 February 2009. Both are nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. The Royal Navy's HMS "Vanguard" and the French Navy's "Le Triomphant" both sustained damage, but no injuries or radioactivity releases were reported. At the time of the collision, both vessels were submerged and, according to the UK Ministry of Defence, moving "at very low speed"; both are equipped with active and passive sonar, although only the latter is used on an operational patrol.
Submarines.
HMS "Vanguard" was on a routine patrol in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean with a crew of 135, and can carry a maximum load of 16 Trident 2 D5 ballistic missiles and carry up to 48 warheads in total. "Triomphant" was returning from a tour of duty when the incident occurred; it was carrying a crew of 111, and capable of being equipped with 16 M45 ballistic missiles with up to 48 warheads in total.
Collision.
On the night between 3–4 February 2009, the two submarines collided in the Atlantic Ocean. On 6 February 2009, the French Ministry of Defence reported that "Triomphant" "collided with an immersed object (probably a container)" The UK Ministry of Defence initially would not comment that the incident took place. On 16 February 2009, the incident was confirmed by First Sea Lord Sir Jonathon Band, in response to a question at an unrelated event. Band said that the collision occurred at low speed, and that there had been no injuries. The French Ministry of Defence also stated that a collision "at a very low speed" had occurred, with no casualties.
Both vessels were damaged. "Vanguard" received damage to the outer casing in the area of the missile compartment on the starboard (right) side. "Triomphant" was initially said to have received damage to the active sonar dome under her bow, indicating that "Triomphant" ran into "Vanguard" from above and amidship, but was later reported as having received impacts to three parts of her structure, with her conning tower and the starboard sail plane attached to the conning tower visibly deformed by the incident. According to the Daily Telegraph, the cost of repairing the damage to both boats was expected to amount to up to £50 million. Both vessels returned to home bases under their own power, "Vanguard" to HMNB Clyde (Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde) in the Firth of Clyde, on 14 February 2009 and "Triomphant" to Île Longue in Brittany, escorted by a frigate as a normal procedure, although it is unclear whether this was an unplanned return following the incident.
Possible cause.
Media reports have discussed two possible aspects contributing to the incident; geographic separation of the submarine operating areas (known as waterspace management), and the ability of each submarine to detect the other using acoustic methods. 
While the use of active sonar may have revealed the position of one submarine to the other, it is unlikely either boat was operating its active sonar at the time of the collision. Ballistic missile submarines are designed to conceal themselves while on patrol, and the use of active sonar would immediately reveal the boat's position. Several media outlets stated that because both submarines are equipped with modern anechoic tile coverings over their hulls and were travelling at low speed, it would have been unlikely for either submarine to have detected the presence of the other while using only their passive sonar systems. Further, as reported by "Time" magazine, submarines take advantage of environmental characteristics, such as ocean currents of varying temperatures (thermoclines) or varying salinity (haloclines), to avoid detection.
The British Broadcasting Corporation has speculated that though highly improbable considering the vastness of the areas in which they operate, the actual areas used by ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) are in reality limited, and overlap (alleged to often be between Malin Head and Rockall Bank). They have claimed that the use of these areas by submarines of the British, French and Russian navies has increased the risk of accidental collision.
Several media outlets have referred to comments by retired Royal Navy Commodore Stephen Saunders, editor of the "Jane's Fighting Ships", where he described the incident as "very serious" and said it was time for France and Britain to coordinate their submarine operations more actively, suggesting that the use of operating areas is not communicated between operators of SSBNs; France, the UK and the United States or that communication procedures were not effective. "I would have thought it possible to at least arrange to be in different parts of the ocean without compromising operational security," said Saunders. "No doubt there are a number of technical issues to be investigated, but the root of the problem appears to be procedural." This position appears to be corroborated by Admiral Sandy Woodward, a former commander of the Royal Navy's submarine force. In a commentary article for "The Independent" newspaper, he said that whilst it is not known whether the UK and France exchange information now, it was not the case when he served as Flag Officer Submarines in 1984. He recalls that his French counterpart proposed that London and Paris share information on SSBN patrols, precisely to avoid an incident at sea, but no agreement was reached at the time on achieving that.
Aftermath.
With the delayed acknowledgement of the accident, both the British and French ministries of defence have been accused of attempting a cover-up of the collision. The delay in reporting the accident has also been criticised in the international press. There has been no official explanation for the event. British MP Nick Harvey has demanded an official inquiry into the issue. Kate Hudson, chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said, "The collision of two submarines, both with nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons onboard could have released vast amounts of radiation and scattered scores of nuclear warheads across the seabed". However, Band said that there "was no compromise to nuclear safety".
Hervé Morin, France's Minister of Defence, said that they "face an extremely simple technological problem, which is that these submarines are not detectable".

This Is War

This Is War is the third studio album by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars, released through Virgin Records and EMI on December 8, 2009. Upon its release, it peaked at number 18 on the "Billboard" 200.
Background and development.
30 Seconds to Mars were sued for breach-of-contract by their record label, Virgin Records, in mid-2008. The label sought $30 million in damages, claiming that the band had failed to produce three of the five records they were obligated to deliver under their 1999 contract with the now-defunct Immortal Records. In 2004, Virgin took over the contract. Jared Leto responded to some of the claims in the suit on the band's website and was coerced into dismissing rumors that the group had disbanded. He said the claims were "ridiculously overblown" and "totally unrealistic", before stating "under California law, where we live and signed our deal, one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years." 30 Seconds to Mars had been contracted for nine years, so the band decided to exercise their "legal right to terminate our old, out-of-date contract, which according to the law is null and void."
After nearly a year of the lawsuit battle, the band announced on April 29, 2009, that the case had been settled. The suit was resolved following a defence based on a contract case involving actress Olivia de Havilland decades before. Leto explained, "The California Appeals Court ruled that no service contract in California is valid after seven years, and it became known as the De Havilland Law after she used it to get out of her contract with Warner Bros." 30 Seconds to Mars then decided to re-sign with EMI (the parent label of Virgin). Leto said the band had "resolved our differences with EMI" and the decision had been made because of "the willingness and enthusiasm by EMI to address our major concerns and issues, (and) the opportunity to return to work with a team so committed and passionate about Thirty Seconds to Mars". He said it was "the most challenging business obstacle that we've ever gone through as a band."
Upon completion of the record, Leto spoke of the troubles the band faced while working on "This Is War"; "We spent two years of our lives working on that record, and it was us against the world... There were times that it was overwhelming. Everything that was going on was brutal... It was a case of survival, to tell the truth."
Leto produced a documentary "Artifact", that chronicled the state of the modern music industry through their dispute with their record company. Other musicians also gave accounts of their industry experiences. The film premiered at at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival where it was well received and won the People's Choice Award for Best Documentary.
Writing and recording.
During recording sessions, the band hosted a gathering in they called "The Summit" at the Avalon club in Los Angeles. The purpose of this was so that fans could see how far into recording the band was, and maybe even participate in the recording. In an interview, frontman Jared Leto said this:
"The Summit was an experiment in our recording process, and we were just trying to think of ways that we could deepen the connection between ourselves and our family of fans around the world. We do that often, and think of ways to break the boundary. And we thought, 'How great would it be to invite the world to come and be a part of the next 30 Seconds to Mars album? [...] There were some things tried that were left-field sound experiments — using the group, the collective, as a musical instrument. We did everything from percussive expression to whispering to things that were a little bit more familiar, like inviting the 1,000 people that were there to sing the chorus of a song. And those people who were a part of it all will be a part of the next 30 Seconds to Mars album. ... It was quite simply one of the best things we've done as a band."
Further on in this interview, Jared revealed that album's style will be leaning more towards that of their self-titled debut than that of "A Beautiful Lie", saying that,
"The longest song on there is, like, eight minutes. The shortest, probably five. ... I don't think we have one under five. I think we do a really good job at just chasing the feeling, the core of the song, and allowing the song the ability or right to go where it leads us, where it wants to go. The song dictates that, and we've been working on this collection of songs for 12 months, so we know them pretty well."
During May 2009, Kanye West posted a photo of himself, Brandon Flowers (the frontman of The Killers) and Jared Leto together and announced that he and Jared were working together on a song named "Hurricane". This collaboration was only included on an early version of "Hurricane", and West's work did not make it onto the album. Leto said that he,
"...had actually brought up idea of working with West some time ago, but it's pretty unbelievable that it actually happened. [...] He came by here, he was here in the studio, and we did some initial kind of listening, and he did some singing, and we knew we needed to kind of follow up and finish things, so I went over to Hawaii an engineer and a small crew, and we had a great time."
West's vocal contribution to the song was ultimately removed because of legal issues surrounding the rights of each record company. Although it was not released on the original pressing of the album, Leto has said the track will be heard eventually. The early leaked versions of the album had the version of "Hurricane" featuring Kanye West included. The album was released in a Deluxe form with this version.
Musical style and themes.
Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine acknowledged the band's progression since their last record; saying that it was a liability "When they were mining a post-grunge or nu metal or emo vein," but now the group has deviated to a sound that is more reminiscent of "a hybrid of The Killers' retro new wave and My Chemical Romance's gothic prog." He said following the band's transposition "they've wound up with a sound that suits their stance", referring to the overall style of the record as a mixture of synth rock, metal, and progressive rock. Sara Anderson from AOL Radio referred to "This Is War"'s "extremely progressive rock sound with killer choruses"; saying the album clearly takes inspiration from experimental Pink Floyd to melodic M83. "Billboard" writer Cortney Harding said the album "represented an artistic step forward for the band," observing that the band hasn't completely abandoned its melodic and hard rock tendencies. "The Times" described the record's sound as "a tighter, more textured set of eyeliner indie-rock tunes than the group's previous albums".
30 Seconds to Mars frontman Jared Leto described the record as a concept album, proceeding to say "if this isn't, I'm not sure what is". He said the record was created in an "intense two-year period, where it felt like the whole world was falling apart and massive changes were going on. I think you can hear that in the sound of this album." Furthermore, he refused to call the album a rock opera, "People seem OK with calling it 'a rock opera'... I would never say that though; the only thing I'm comfortable saying 'rock opera' about is "Tommy" by The Who. But it's very conceptual, about many spiritual things, and it really is simply who we are, who we've become."
Leto described the style as "much more electronic and experimental, with lots of vintage synths." Leto also mentioned that he had written lyrics about some themes he felt were missing from their previous work, such as optimism and sexuality only for the song "Stranger in a Strange Land". "Rock Sound" writer Victoria Durham referred to the dramatic themes instilled in the album, such as "Night of the Hunter" which she said "is one of the album's most dramatic efforts" and also reminiscing over their previous album, "A Beautiful Lie", which he says "featured its share of over-dramatic moments, (but) this time the band have blasted them into the stratosphere. The massive-sounding 'Vox Populi' is a prime example." She reiterates Leto's claim, noting the track has a "feeling of all-conquering optimism".
The music video for the song "Hurricane" was banned by MTV and several other TV channels around the world. The video, which runs for 13 minutes and 10 seconds and was directed by Jared Leto under the pseudonym Bartholomew Cubbin, premiered on MTV on November 29, 2010. "I didn't expect all this to happen, but it's a good thing that it happens, only because of the conversation that it may provoke, about these sort of things, and looking at art and creative expression and weighing that against protecting the viewers from the exhibition of certain behaviors." —Jared Leto, the director and writer of Hurricane video due to its censor. " 
The video was censored and banned because of its elements of violence, nudity and sex. On November 28, 2010, Jared Leto posted the letter from MTV about the censorship of the video on his blog. The list features the offending scenes, such as a woman running her finger on the anus of another G-string woman, which was classified as "restricted". It was only this shot which had made the video completely restricted.
Promotion and release.
BioWare has announced that the soundtrack of "" contains the song "This Is War", the title track. The track made its world debut in the game before the release of the album. Steve Schnur, Worldwide Executive of Music and Music Marketing at Electronic Arts described working with 30 Seconds to Mars:
"EA has always had a forward-thinking relationship with 30 Seconds to Mars and we are overwhelmed with excitement about the band's involvement and creative contribution to "Dragon Age: Origins". This exciting song debut exemplifies our continued commitment to working with great bands that move the needle to where music is going."
Jared Leto commented, "We always try to push the envelope both in the entertainment world and the media, and our title track to debut in a game of this caliber is one of the best ways to bring our music to fans around the world. We've come a long way from having to rely solely on radio to approach and engage music fans, and "Dragon Age: Origins" is the perfect game to do this with."
"This Is War" features 2,000 different album covers featuring individual photos of fans from around the world. The band asked fans to submit pictures of themselves, and then selected the 2,000 best images. The images were then used as covers for the album itself and shipped randomly to stores around the world.
Cobra Starship frontman Gabe Saporta revealed to MTV News that he is featured on one of the covers, after sending in a photo and not expecting to be selected. Leto's mother also features on a cover. There is also a number of other notable persons including manager Irving Azoff and label executives Ron Werre, Greg Thompson, Angelica Cob-Baehler, Colin Finklestein and Bob Semanovich; as well as celebrities Bam Margera, Kat Von D, Conan O'Brien and members of the bands Chevelle and Street Drum Corps.
The CD booklet, as well as the promotional and digital artwork features a roaring tiger. All retail albums include varied sleeves, separate from the booklet, featuring one of the 2,000 different covers.
The song "Escape" is featured in TV spots and in the trailer for the 2011 film adaption of "I Am Number Four".

Kees van der Pijl

Kees van der Pijl (born 15 June 1947) is a Dutch political scientist who is emeritus professor of international relations at the University of Sussex. He is known for his critical approach to global political economy and has published, amongst others, a trilogy on "Modes of Foreign Relations and Political Economy" (2007, 2010, 2014); "Global Rivalries from the Cold War to Iraq" (2006); "Transnational Classes and International Relations" (1998); and "The Making of an Atlantic Ruling Class" (1984, reprinted 2012). 
Biography.
Kees van der Pijl studied law at Leiden University from 1965 to 1967. After military service as a reserve officer in the Royal Dutch Military Police, and a trip through the Soviet Union to Japan in 1970, he switched to political science, a specialisation taught in Leiden as part of the public law degree. His most influential teachers were Hans Daalder, Ben Sijes, and the Indologist, J.C. Heesterman, with whom he wrote his final thesis on the politics of regional diversity in India.
He graduated in 1973 and was hired as a junior lecturer by the Department of International Relations at the University of Amsterdam in that year. In 1983 he received his doctorate at the University of Amsterdam on a thesis titled "Imperialism and Class Formation in the North Atlantic Area", supervised by Gerd Junne. He was involved in the Dutch Communist Party (CPN) and also published short stories and three novels (1989, 1992, 1994, all with De Harmonie). Van der Pijl was co-director of the Research Centre for International Political Economy (Recipe) from 1992 to 1998. With Henk Overbeek, Ries Bode, Otto Holman, Bastiaan van Apeldoorn and others, this created a tentative Amsterdam School of global political economy.
In 2000, Van der Pijl moved to the United Kingdom to take up the chair in international relations at the University of Sussex, vacant after the retirement of Professor Michael Nicholson. He was appointed director of the Centre for Global Political Economy (CGPE) at that university when it was launched in 2001 (until 2006), and was subject chair/head of the Department of Politics and International Relations from 2002 to 2004. In 2006 he was awarded a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship. He has taught as a visiting professor at the University of Auvergne at Clermont-Ferrand (2005, 2006) and at L’Orientale University in Naples (2009, 2010). His work has been nominated for prizes in 2007 and 2008 and he was awarded the Deutscher Memorial Prize in 2008 for "Nomads, Empires, States" (Pluto 2007). On his return to the Netherlands he joined the Dutch Anti-Fascist Resistance (AFVN/BvA, issued from the wartime communist underground and a member organisation of the Fédération Internationale des Résistants (FIR)) and became its president in 2013.
Research.
The work of Kees van der Pijl covers four main areas: a) transnational classes; b) the structure of the global political economy; c) the history of ideas in International Relations and Global Political Economy; d) modes of foreign relations.
Transnational classes.
The study of transnational class formation was central in the work at the University of Amsterdam. It built on the writings of Christian Palloix, Nikos Poulantzas, Alfred Sohn-Rethel and on the materialist Cold War history in the United States (Joyce and Gabriel Kolko). Van der Pijl’s contribution was on the transmission of American mass production to Western Europe in the Marshall Plan and the relegation of the cartelised European steel industry to the role of a supplier for the automobile industry, resulting in a first book in Dutch (1978). Economic statesmen involved in this process weld their different ‘fractional’ perspectives (heavy/light industrial, national/international trade, investment and commercial banking, etc.) into ‘globale beheersconcepties’ (comprehensive concepts of control, a notion coined by Ries Bode). A concept of control projects a presumed general interest totalising all others, under the guidance of the dominant fraction. In his doctoral dissertation of 1983 and the book based on it ("The Making of an Atlantic Ruling Class", Verso 1984, reprinted with a new preface 2012), Van der Pijl applied this to the evolution of transatlantic class formation. In "Transnational Classes and International Relations" (Routledge 1998), neoliberalism is identified as the hegemonic concept of control in the closing decades of the 20th century. This book also analyses the managerial ‘cadre’, an auxiliary class of salaried functionaries with directive-educative roles. The cadre typically come to the fore in major crises (the 1930s, the 1970s, and again today), proposing managerial alternatives to liberalism. If not checked by popular mobilization, their intervention may assume authoritarian forms.
Structure of the global political economy.
Challenging the state-centric understanding of world politics, which assumes that each state contains a self-enclosed society, van der Pijl distinguishes a "Lockean heartland" (after the ideologue of the 1688 Glorious Revolution in England) at the centre of the global political economy. This is composed of the white-majority, English-speaking countries. Its common law tradition favouring social self-regulation and distrust of state encroachment, ideology of possessive individualism, and missionary interpretation of its role in the world (inspired by Puritanism) have fostered the development of capitalist social relations. The Lockean heartland has interacted with rival states seeking to impose themselves on their societies, to balance and withstand the influence of the liberal West and avoid colonisation. These "contender states", of which France in the long 18th century, Germany, Japan and Italy from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries, and the Soviet Union after World War II, have been the most important ones, develop through revolutions from above (Gramsci’s ‘passive revolution’) into alternatives to transnational Western liberalism. This line of analysis, developed in 'Transnational Classes and IR' and more recently in "Global Rivalries from the Cold War to Iraq" (Pluto and Sage-Vistaar 2006, Turkish trans., Imge 2014) leads to the identification of China as the current primary contender.
History of international thought.
Building on the concepts of the Anglophone Lockean heartland and the contender states, Van der Pijl in "Vordenker der Weltpolitik" (Leske+Budrich 1996, revised from an earlier work in Dutch) argued that the liberal West typically produced ‘idealist’ conceptions of world order, against the ‘realist’ power politics perspective of the contenders. After World War I, there was an exodus of such ‘realists’ from the European continent to the United States, incorporating the realist argument into the IR mainstream. At Sussex, Van der Pijl has posted a web-textbook for the MA in Global Political Economy, 'A Survey of Global Political Economy'. In volumes II and III of his "Modes of foreign relations" project, Van der Pijl discusses what myth and religion say about foreign relations, and how liberalism prescribes the nation-state form for the world. The third volume, The Discipline of Western Supremacy (2014) presents a historical sociology of the IR discipline in this light.
Modes of foreign relations.
In the Modes of foreign relations project, sponsored by the Leverhulme Trust under a major research fellowship 2006-2009, Van der Pijl argues that inter-state relations (as well as the national state form itself) are transient, historical forms of more fundamental foreign relations. Just as Marx developed a critique of equilibrium economics by claiming that this was only one ‘mode of production’, which had been preceded and would be followed by others, Van der Pijl in this project challenges the ‘IR’ paradigm. Modes of foreign relations include a tribal, an empire/nomad, the sovereign equality, and the global governance modes; in each, a specific way occupation of space, its protection, and the exchange with others, are made possible by a given level of civilisation.

Henri Le Fauconnier

Henri Victor Gabriel Le Fauconnier (July 5, 1881 – December 25, 1946) was a French cubist painter born in Hesdin.
Henri Le Fauconnier studied in the studio of Jean-Paul Laurens, then in the Academie Julian. He exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1905, implementing bold colors in line with Henri Matisse. He moved to Brittany in 1907 and painted the rocky landscapes of Ploumanac'h, characterized by chastened tones of brown and greens with thick outlines delimiting the simplified forms. He explored a personal style and put it into practice; painting nudes or portraits (such as that of the poet Pierre Jean Jouve in 1909 (Musée National d'Art Moderne). Back in Paris, he mingles with the artistic and literary gathered around Paul Fort at the Closerie des Lilas in Montparnasse.
At the 1909 Salon d’Automne Le Fauconnier exhibited alongside Constantin Brâncuși, Jean Metzinger and Fernand Léger.
Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 1910 Salon des Indépendants, made a passing and inaccurate reference to Le Fauconnier, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Fernand Léger, as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."
Metzinger had written in 1910 of 'mobile perspective' as an interpretation of what would soon become known as "Cubism" with respect to Picasso, Braque, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier.
At the invitation of Wassily Kandinsky, Le Fauconnier published a theoretical text in the catalog of the Neue Künstlervereinigung (Munich, 1910). He opened his Rue Visconti studio in Paris to artists eager like him to apply the lessons of Cézanne. With Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay, he contributed to the Cubist scandal of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants. Le Fauconnier exhibited his vast "Les Montagnards attaqués par des ours" (Mountaineers Attacked by Bears) at the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (Paris).
February 1912 Henri Le Fauconnier was appointed to succeed Jacques-Émile Blanche as "chef d'atelier" of the avant-garde school of art Académie de La Palette. Le Fauconnier commissioned Jean Metzinger and André Dunoyer de Segonzac as full-time instructors for the morning sessions; Eugeniusz Żak (Eugène Zak) and Jean Francis Auburtin took over in the afternoon.
Le Fauconnier was a contributing member of the Section d'Or (Puteaux Group).
He died in Paris (1946).

Belfast Boys' Model School

Belfast Boys' Model School (previously the Belfast Model School or Belfast District Model School) is a boys only secondary school located in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
History.
During its long history, the Belfast Model School has been located on three sites:
Building of the Belfast District Model School began in Divis Street in 1854, on a 100-acre tract of land leased by the Commissioners of Education in Ireland, and the school was opened on 19 May 1857. It was to be a "model" for all other schools in the district, and the thirteenth of its kind. On 22 December 1879, Prof. John Perry, president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, highlighted the Belfast Model as an example to be followed in a proposed reform of technical education in England.
During riots and arson attacks surrounding the consideration of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in May 1922, the Divis Street premises were burned down. Premises were purchased in Cliftonville Road and classes resumed in Cliftonville Lodge, until a new building was opened in 1937. The Belfast Model remained on Cliftonville Road until implementation in 1954 of the Tripartite System, under the Education Act (Northern Ireland) 1947, caused the school to split into separate boys' and girls' schools. The Belfast Boys' Model School began operations in Ballysillan Road in 1957, while the Cliftonville Road premises became the site of present-day Cliftonville Integrated Primary School.

In September 2010, the Boys' Model School moved into a brand new,multi million pound modern school on the same site of the old school.

List of HIV/AIDS cases and deaths registered by region

This page lists the reported and registered HIV/AIDS cases by reporting region. This may be a country or subdivision, for some large nations national statistics are complicated and rare. This list is only documented cases, not for estimated cases. Estimated cases can vary wildly by source and year, and often are significantly higher than reported cases. 
US CDC has begun reporting AIDS related deaths but HIV cases is not uniform among states. Reporting of cases and deaths may be delayed by years in many nations, masking epidemics. Globally, some 35.3 million are living with HIV/AIDS, World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 36 million people have died since the first cases were reported in 1981 and 1.6 million people died of HIV/AIDS in 2012. Using WHO statistics, in 2012 the number of people living with HIV is running at roughly double (1.98%), cumulative people with HIV at triple (3.22%) the rate of worldwide human population growth (1.1% annual).
List.
"Color code: Countries/regions in light blue have latest year HIV cases exceeding 10% of cumulative total, deep blue exceeding 20%, and pink exceeding 30%." These colors suggest an outbreak or insufficient reporting. If HIV estimates are correct, government efforts to report are still hugely inadequate, only 1 in 4 HIV cases have ever been reported globally, and 1 in 13 deaths (using this list as reference). Note: Deaths in US jurisdictions include all causes.

Henri Mallard

Henri Marie Joseph Mallard, Australian Photographer (1884–1967)
Born in Balmain (Sydney, Australia) of French parents, he came to photography via the industry. Using his French connections, and accent (which was strong owing to his home education), he secured a position in 1900 with Harrington (later Kodak Pty Ltd) as a sales representative to the French consulate. He remained with the company, becoming general manager, until 1952. With ready access to equipment and materials he was an enthusiastic amateur exhibitor by 1904.
He used his business and connections to support other photographers; he was influential on fellow Sydney-sider Frank Hurley, encouraging the budding photographer's interest in the medium and in 1911 recommending Hurley for the position of official photographer to Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic expedition, ahead of himself.; moving to Harington's Melbourne office in 1913, he opened the showrooms to exhibitions, including that of John Kauffmann in 1914.
He was a strong advocate for art photography; on his return to Sydney (1916) he joined (in 1917) the Sydney Camera Circle whose "manifesto" had been drawn up and signed on 28 November 1916 by the founding group of six photographers; Harold Cazneaux, Cecil Bostock, James Stening, W.S. White, Malcolm McKinnon and James Paton. They pledged "to work and to advance pictorial photography and to show our own Australia in terms of sunlight rather than those of greyness and dismal shadows". He also contributed lectures and technical demonstrations to the New South Wales Photographic Society.
He is best known for his documentation of the Australian icon Sydney Harbour Bridge between the late 1920s to the early 1930s. Photographing from precarious vantage points on the bridge itself, sometimes a hundred metres above Sydney Harbour, his work sets the construction against the harbour and the growing city and uses the figures of the workers to represent the scale of this Depression-era engineering feat. His pictures and film of the Bridge were an intentional historical document and the project was self-generated. Between 1930 and 1932, he produced hundreds of stills and film footage.
Prior to his project to document the Bridge, Mallard worked in the Pictorialist style prevailing in the New South Wales Photographic Society, and though Modernist in composition and design, many of the Bridge images are printed in bromoil. By comparison, Harold Cazneaux's contemporaneous photographs, taken from around the base of the bridge, retain a romantic Pictorialism. In 1976 the Australian Centre for Photography commissioned David Moore (1927–2003) to make an archive of gelatin silver prints from the collection of Mallard's glass negatives and these were published in association with Sun Books in 1978.
“Here we have the documentary photograph, radical enough in its context, the social document, a large slice of Sydney’s evolution and an example to all of us who think of future generations in terms of historical narration.” Max Dupain

<doc id="21560902" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21560902" title="Brain Warp">
Brain Warp

Brain Warp is an electronic audio game made by Tiger Electronics and released on June 16, 1996. Players follow the spoken instructions of the game unit by choosing the correct number or color. Its catch phrase which the voice says before a game begins is: "If you don't keep up with me, you're finished!".
The spherical unit has six colored knobs - purple, red, green, white, orange and yellow - with numbers on them, and a blue base. A second version was released in 2002 with a translucent black base. The voice calls out a color, a number, or both, depending on the game selected, and the player flips the unit so that the correct knob is facing upwards. After every four points, the game becomes faster. If the player responds incorrectly, the round is ended and the unit will make a raspberry sound. There are six games in total - three where the player has to follow the command, one memory game that uses a combination of colors and numbers, a code buster game and a game called Pass Attack where players have to make up their own pattern. When the game has finished, the voice will say "This game, is finished." After a pause he the game will encourage the player to play the game again by saying "Wanna warp again?" 
The game was the most popular in Duracell's Kids' Choice National Toy Survey in 1996.
There has been some models that were manufactured incorrectly and results in some audio recordings leaving a gap. Also one notable thing is the music and the sound effects are not in tune. Units like these can cause problems with the sensors and when trying to select game three, four five and six, an error noise will sound as the game thinks that the player isn't holding the knob correctly.
Brain Shift.
On September 6, 1998, Tiger Electronics released a similar game to Brain Warp, a tabletop electronic audio game called Brain Shift. Players move a 'stick shift' in response to voice commands to complete color and sound patterns, and the game becomes increasingly fast. The game requires close attention, and teaches children to recognize and replicate patterns. It came second in the 1998 Duracell Kids' Choice National Toy Survey, and gained a "Seal of Approval" from the US-based National Parenting Center. The hype around the release by Tiger Electronics of the Furby at the same time allowed the company to concentrate its marketing on Brain Shift. This game has two different versions of introduction. It either says "Ok, listen up" or "Alright!" followed by its catchphrase, "Get your brain in gear and let's play Brain Shift." This game has six colors: red, green, yellow, blue, orange and white. The game will then say "Now choose your game" and There are six different games: After choosing a game, the voice will then say "Now how many shifters do we have?" The number of players will be selected and then the game will give a short explanation of how the game is played and then the game will commence.
Some newer units of Brain Shift had a 'Tiger recommends Duracell' sticker attached to the retail packaging and where the batteries are inserted. This was because at that time, Tiger was allowed to promote Duracell batteries on their games.

John Woodward (footballer born 1947)

John Woodward (born 6 January 1947) is an English former footballer. A forward, he scored 66 goals in 269 league games in a 13-year career in the Football League. He played and scored in all four divisions of the Football League.
He began his career at Stoke City, before he was sold on to Aston Villa for a £30,000 fee in October 1966. He switched to Walsall three years later, before he joined Port Vale for a fee of £2,250 in February 1973. He finished as the club's top-scorer in 1973–74, but suffered a loss of form and was allowed to join Scunthorpe United in May 1975. After two years with the "Iron" he had spells with Belgian club Oostende and Southern League side Kidderminster Harriers.
Playing career.
Woodward began his career with Stoke City, playing three First Division games in the 1964–65 season. He scored his first senior goal on 27 March 1965, in a 2–1 victory over Aston Villa at the Victoria Ground. He played six games without scoring in 1965–66, and made just two appearances in 1966–67. Aston Villa had been suitably impressed however to offer £30,000 for the striker's services in October 1966, and "Potters" boss Tony Waddington gladly accepted the offer. He was signed to replace Tony Hateley, who had been sold to Chelsea.
The "Villans" suffered relegation in 1966–67, and could only finish 16th and 18th in the Second Division in 1967–68 and 1968–69. Woodward scored seven goals in 26 league games during a turbulent time at Villa Park, in which Dick Taylor, Tommy Cummings, and Tommy Docherty all had brief spells as manager.
He moved on to Bill Moore's Walsall, who posted a 12th place finish in the Third Division in 1969–70. The "Saddlers" avoided relegation on goal difference in 1970–71, before rising to ninth in 1971–72. John Smith then took over at Fellows Park, and led the club to a 17th place finish in 1972–73. He scored 23 goals in 125 league games during his four-year spell at the club.
Woodward joined league rivals Port Vale for a fee of £2,250 in February 1973. He hit nine goals in 17 Third Division games in 1972–73, as Gordon Lee's "Valiants" finished four places and four points shy of promotion. Woodward hit 18 goals in 48 appearances in 1973–74 to finish as the club's top-scorer. However Lee resigned in January, and the club finished just one place above the relegation zone under new boss Roy Sproson. Under Sproson's management there were numerous contract disputes, and Woodward was the first to get into such a dispute, and was placed on the transfer-list at his own request in July 1974. Sproson said "he is trying to hold us to ransom and we are not having that". Woodward only hit five goals in 41 games in 1974–75, and was given a free transfer in May 1975.
He moved on to Fourth Division side Scunthorpe United for the 1975–76 campaign. The "Iron" avoided the re-election places on goal difference, and then finished one place and one point above the re-election zone in 1976–77 under the stewardship of Ron Ashman. Woodward then departed the Old Showground, and had a spell in Belgium with Oostende, before returning to England to play at Aggborough for Southern League side Kidderminster Harriers.

Sonisphere Festival

The Sonisphere Festival is a touring rock music festival which takes place across Europe between June and August. The festival is owned by John Jackson and Kilimanjaro Live. It is jointly promoted by K2 and Kilimanjaro Live. It has hosted heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, Mötley Crüe, Slayer, and Megadeth.
Event history.
The idea for Sonisphere was first conceived by John Jackson in the late 90`S. John chose the name Sonisphere, from a combination of Sonic and Sphere. In 2008 Stuart Galbraith had formed business partnership with AEG Live called Kilimanjaro Live. John Jackson approached Stuart Galbraith with the idea of a Pan-World touring festival which fit in with plans Kilimanjaro Live had to launch a UK festival. John Jackson is the Creator and Director of Sonisphere and Galbriath the Producer.
The first run of festivals ran throughout the summer of 2009 at six venues, returning in 2010 and 2011 with 11 venues.
Plans for future festivals consist of increasing the number of festivals, making the event global rather than local to Europe, expanding the UK event into a 3-day festival, and increasing the UK capacity from 40,000 to 60,000 attendees.

Éamonn Mac Thomáis

Éamonn MacThomáis (13 January 1927–16 August 2002) was an author, broadcaster, historian, Irish Republican, advocate of the Irish Language and lecturer. He presented his own series on Dublin on RTÉ (Irish National Broadcaster) during the 70s and was well known for guided tours and lectures of his beloved Dublin. He is buried in Dublin's Glasnevin Cemetery.
Biography.
MacThomáis came from a staunch Republican family. He was born Edward Patrick Thomas in the Dublin suburb of Rathmines. His father, a fire-brigade officer, died when Éamonn was five years old and his family moved to Goldenbridge, Inchicore. He left school at 13 to work as delivery boy for White Heather Laundry, learning Dublin neighbourhoods with great thoroughness. He said he found work to help his mother pay the rent. He later worked as a clerk, and was appointed credit controller for an engineering firm. MacThomáis joined the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Republican Army as a young man and was active in the preparations for and prosecution of the 1956-62 border campaign. He was interned in Curragh Camp during the campaign and in December 1961 was sentenced to 4 months imprisonment under the Offences Against the State Act.
At the November 1959 Ardfheis he was elected to the Ardchomhairle of Sinn Féin, and edited and contributed to the Sinn Féin newspaper "The United Irishman".
He was a close friend of Tomás MacGiolla, and was deeply affected by the 1970 split in Sinn Féin. MacThomáis took the Provisional side, opposing MacGiolla.
He took over as editor of "An Phoblacht" in 1972. In July 1973, he was arrested and charged with IRA membership at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin. He refused to recognise the court but he gave a lengthy address from the dock. The following month he was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment. Within two months of completing his sentence he was again before the court on the same charge and received a 15-month sentence. Editors of six left-wing and Irish-language journals called for his release, as did a number of writers, and hundreds attended protest meetings - to no avail. He served his full sentence. Tim Pat Coogan who was editor of the Irish Press noted that the charges against MacThomáis were politically motivated to a large degree as his activities were confined strictly to the newspaper An Phoblacht.
Under Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, due to his membership of Sinn Féin in the 1970s he was removed from his position in making some of the RTÉ historical programmes. As a historian he made numerous contributions to various historical publications such as the "Dublin Historical Review".
From 1974 he wrote a number of books on old Dublin. They sold well and remained in print for over 20 years. He also started a number of walking tours of Dublin, which proved very popular. He died in 2002.
His son Shane, also a historian, also ran similar walking tours and was resident historian at Glasnevin cemetery before his death in 2014.

Kerry Boston GAA

The Kerry Boston Club are a Gaelic football club in Boston. They are one of the oldest in Boston.
History.
Kerry was one of the first clubs formed in Boston, along with the Galway Club. 
Early history of the club is omitted. Kerry enjoyed early success; they were New England Champions in 1928. Kerry's Jim Sullivan came to Boston in 1927 after winning two All-Ireland Medals at home. He played with Kerry Boston for a number of years. Depression and wars affected the games. All-Ireland Champions, Mayo visited Boston in 1937 and played a Boston selection, which included Kerry's Jim Sullivan, Johnny Quirke and Michael Dalton from the Kerry Club. 
Football was at a low ebb during World War II until things started back up in 1947. John Twomey spearheaded the club during this era. The team picture from 1949 shows many of the players that made up the 1947 team. According to the older members of the club, challenge games were played in 1947 but no championship. Kerry continued to thrive during the 1950s and started the 1960s with another championship success in 1960. A notable event in the '50s was the formation of the St. John's Club by a few of the Kerry players. The St. John's Club folded after three years. 
In speaking to one of the former greats of the Kerry Boston scene, he recalled being paid $15.00 a game by the Galway Football Club during the early 1950s. In 1960 a number of players came from Ireland to live in Boston, John and Mickey Teahan, John Flynn, Gerry Lynch, Sean Garvey, Tim McGillicuddy, John Nash, Frank Donoghue, Jim Maunsell and Joe Courtney, winning the Championship the same year. However, the Kerry team was beaten in 1961 as some of the players were in the Army. The Kerry Club had another championship in 1963. The club's success in the 1960s was spurred by a new wave of immigrants. 
Kerry won the 1974 championship on objection. Kerry won with the great players like Pete Nash, Kieran Whelan, Oliver Briody, John Loftus, P.J. Shaughnessy, Joe Maunsell and Joe Driscoll. The success of the club in the '70s and '80s was lean in comparison to the standards reached in the 1990s. 
Kerry competed in five Senior Championships in the '90s, winning three. Over the same time span the club won two Junior Championships. The Kingdom's dominance of the Boston scene was reflected on two occasions in 1993 and again 1996 when they claimed the Senior/Junior double. On both occasions, Mike Christy O'Connor was the manager of the Senior team. He is the only manager since 1963 to lead his team to a Senior title on the field, without winning by objection. He still holds this distinction today.
Senior Championship wins: 1993, 1996 and 1999 Junior Championship wins: 1993, and 1996 
In 1997 the club became the first club in the North American Board history to field three teams, competing in Senior, Intermediate and Junior. 
With the turn of the new millennium the club continues to thrive in Boston. In 2002 the Kerry club of Boston won the Intermediate Championship in Boston, and only losing by the narrowest of margins (1 point) in the North American Final in Gaelic Park in Chicago. 
The following year (2003) the club went on to win the North American Junior B title.
The Kerry Club won both the Northeast Intermediate Championship and Northeast Junior B Championship in 2007, which saw Kerry's Junior squad go all the way to the North American final with the likes of Carol O'Connell, Sean Pete O'Sullivan, Ger Barry, Dan O'Connor, Timmy O'Neill, Mike Moriarty and Chris O'Connor leading the way. The Intermediate side which featured players like Bernard O'Connor, Johnny Maroney, Jonathan o Donnell, Mike Godley, and John McGrath made it to the semi-final but were defeated in a tough competition against the Sons of Boru from San Francisco.
The Kerry club competed in Junior A and Intermediate football in 2008. The Juniors lost in the Boston semi-final to the Aiden McAnespies. The Intermediate squad lost in the Boston final to Galway but met the same Galway team in the North American final and claimed the title. It was the first time Kerry Boston had ever won a North American Intermediate Crown. In 2009, the Senior team made it to an Intermediate Semi-final but were badly beaten by the Connemara Gaels while the Junior team didn't qualify for the playoffs.
Honours.

J. Schmalz GmbH

J. Schmalz GmbH was founded as a razor blade factory in 1910 in Glatten in the Black Forest. Over the years, the company’s products changed from razor blades to transport equipment and finally to vacuum technology.
The company is one of the leading suppliers of vacuum technology in the fields of automation and manual handling and clamping. Employing around 800 workers (2014) The company’s sales network includes 15 subsidiaries in China, Finland, France, India, Italy, Japan, Canada, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, Spain, Turkey and the USA.
History.
In 1910, Johannes Schmalz founded the “Johannes Schmalz Rasierklingenfabrik” in Glatten. The “Glattis” brand was both well-known and successful in Germany, selling up to 600,000 razor blades every month.
The proliferation of the electric shaver required the company to change its focus. From 1948 onwards, Artur Schmalz made innovative developments in the field of light motor vehicles. Schmalz supplied luggage trailers and mobile steps to airports and transport equipment to furniture factories. 
When Kurt Schmalz took over the management of the company in 1984, the company moved in a new direction and began to specialise in vacuum technology. In 1990, Wolfgang Schmalz joined the company’s management. Together, the two brothers have transformed a company with a long tradition into an international company.
1998 saw the opening of the company’s first branch office in Switzerland. Today, Schmalz has a sales network of 16 branch offices across the globe. In 2008, the company’s production area in Germany was increased by 10,170 m².
Products.
Schmalz’s vacuum technology is utilized in production processes that require workpieces to be moved, ergonomically transported, or secured.
Sustainability.
Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy, wood chips and hydro-electric power are utilized. Today, Schmalz is able to generate more energy than the company actually needs.

Fall armyworm

The Fall Armyworm ("Spodoptera frugiperda") is part of the order of Lepidoptera and is the caterpillar life stage of a moth. It is regarded as a pest and can wreak havoc with crops if left to multiply. Its name is derived from its feeding habits. They will eat everything in an area and once the food supply is exhausted the entire "army" will move to the next available food source.
Description.
The larvae are a dull yellow to gray with stripes running down the length of the body. The mature caterpillar is approximately 1.5 to in length.
Habitats.
The fall armyworm is widely distributed in eastern and central North America and in South America; it cannot survive freezing temperatures.
Feeding habits.
The armyworm's diet consists mainly of grasses and small grain crops. An infestation is hard to detect as the caterpillars migrate to new feeding areas in the cool of the night. When the caterpillars near maturity, they can lay waste to an entire crop in a few days.
Infestations.
In 1998, Illinois was hard hit by fall armyworms.
Research use.
"Spodoptera frugiperda" cells (Sf9 and Sf21 cell lines) are commonly used in biomedical research for the purpose of recombinant protein expression using insect-specific viruses called baculoviruses.

The John Rabe House (拉贝故居), located at Xiaofenqiao No. 1 (小粉桥1号) in Nanjing, was where John Rabe, former Siemens China Representative and Chairman of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone, resided from 1932 to 1938. Today it accommodates the “John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall” and the “John Rabe Research and Exchange Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.”
The John Rabe House is located in the center of Nanjing, on the campus of Nanjing University. John Rabe stayed here during the Nanking Massacre and protected more than 600 Chinese refugees in this house, and within its garden, from Japanese persecution. It was also in this house where he wrote the famous “Diaries of John Rabe”
For almost half a century, Rabe's former residence in Nanking (as it then was) received little recognition until its location was publicized by the publication of Rabe's diaries in December 1996 by his granddaughter Ursula Reinhardt. When German president Johannes Rau visited Nanjing University in 2003, he expressed concern about the dilapidated condition of John Rabe’s former residence. After Rau’s visit and with his great encouragement to renovate the house, the project kicked off successfully in 2005. The Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Shanghai, together with Siemens Ltd. China, Bosch-Siemens Home Appliances signed an agreement with Nanjing University to renovate the house and construct the “The John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall” and “John Rabe Research and Exchange Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.” The German side was to provide financing while Nanjing University was responsible for the renovation and maintenance of the John Rabe House as well as for the establishment and management of the Memorial Hall and Research Center.
John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall.
On October 31, 2006, the “John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall” officially opened to the public. On 1628 square meters, 6 exhibition areas, more than 300 photographs, files and historical material tell Rabe’s life story. It’s main focus is to commemorate the heroic efforts of John Rabe and the other members of the Nanking Safety Zone, to save innocent lives during the Nanking Massacre. The Memorial Hall in Rabe’s former residence can be visited Monday – Friday from 8:30 to 16:30. Since 2008 the Austrian Service Abroad sends a Peace Servant to work at the Memorial Hall and Exchange Center every year.

Vulcanocalliax

Vulcanocalliax arutyunovi is a species of Thalassinidea (a ghost shrimp or mud lobster) found on a mud volcano in the Gulf of Cádiz between Spain and Morocco. It was discovered during the Census of Marine Life, and is so distinct from its closest relatives that it has been placed in a new subfamily, the Vulcanocallianacinae. The species is unusually large for a ghost shrimp, but despite that appears to brood only a single embryo. The species is named after the volcano on which it was discovered, "Captain Arutyunov".

Law of increasing costs

In economics, the law of increasing costs is a principle that states that once all factors of production (land, labor, capital) are at maximum output and efficiency, producing more will cost more than average. As production increases, the opportunity cost does as well. The best way to look at this is to review an example of an economy that only produces two things - cars and oranges. If all the resources of the economy are put into producing only oranges, there will not be any factors of production available to produce cars. So the result is an output of X number of oranges but 0 cars. The reverse is also true - if all the factors of production are used for the production of cars, 0 oranges will be produced. In between these two extremes are situations where some oranges and some cars are produced. There are three assumptions that are made in this possibility. The economy is experiencing full employment (everyone who wants to work has a job), the best technology is being used and production efficiency is being maximized. So the question becomes, what is the cost of producing more oranges or cars? If the economy is at the maximum for all inputs, then the cost of each unit will be more expensive. The economy will have to incur more variable costs, such as overtime, to produce the unit.
The law also applies to "switching" production in a maxed out economy. Essentially, the economy is still producing more, so the law still applies. The only difference is that resources are being taken from one area and applied to another, instead of simply producing more of the same (as assumed in the first paragraph).
"as we shift factors of production for making one cover service to another, the cost of producing second item increases."

Vinten

Vinten is a manufacturer of camera supports founded in 1910 and based in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.
History.
Vinten, then trading as 'W. Vinten Cinematograph Engineers', was formally founded by William Vinten in 1910 and was originally based at 89-91 Wardour Street, London. The company began in 1909 by manufacturing Kinemacolor projectors for Charles Urban.
In 1914, the company workshops were taken over by the government and Vinten were invited by Sopwith at Kingston upon Thames to work alongside them in their aeroplane factory. This led in 1915 to an invitation by the Royal Flying Corps for William Vinten to design and build a special cine-camera for use in aircraft. Vinten developed the Model B - the first cine-camera that could be operated while hung over the side of an aircraft and as a result began to work in close co-operation with both the military and the film industry.
In 1928 Vinten expanded and moved to Cricklewood, North London, mainly supplying the film industry by creating specialised equipment for companies such as Kodak. By 1937 around three-quarters of all films shown in Britain were processed using equipment developed by Vinten. The company also had a strong presence in creating both sound and production equipment.
The Second World War created an increased requirement for reconnaissance cameras and military contracts secured world market presence for reconnaissance work.
In the late 1940s, the broadcast market began to flourish and Vinten developed the first telerecording camera. As a result the British Broadcasting Corporation became increasingly involved with Vinten. The BBC became the world benchmark for whom Vinten adapted many of their original film camera supports creating equipment more suitable for television cameras.
In 1964 Vinten moved to Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. In 1972, Vinten was floated on the London Stock Exchange.
In the early 1980s Vinten began to develop remote control TV systems early in conjunction with the BBC for use in their main N1, N2 and N3 news studios. Shortly after this a second venture was undertaken with the Saskatchewan Legislature, using the system to televise State governmental proceedings.
In 1984 the company changed its name to Vinten Group plc.
In 1988 Vinten split into two separate entities. W Vinten Ltd (now Thales Optronics Ltd) focused solely on reconnaissance equipment and moved into new premises. Vinten Broadcast Ltd remained on the same site, concentrating on broadcast mounting equipment solutions.
From 1989 Vinten Group began a series of acquisitions: Manfrotto Group (1989), Bexel (1991), Gitzo (1992), Bogen Imaging (1993), TSM Inc for AutoCam product range(1993), Sachtler (1995). Vinten Group plc changed its name to Vitec Group plc in 1995 but the Vinten name continued as Vinten Broadcast Ltd continued to trade as part of the group.
Following the acquisition of Radamec in 2003 a new brand Vinten Radamec was created to take over the manufacture of robotic camera support products.
Vinten continues to be a leading manufacturer of lighweight, television studio and outside broadcast camera supports such as tripods, pedestals and pan and tilt heads. 
Notable Vinten Products.
Vinten HP 419
The Vinten HP 419 'Hydro-Pneumatic'gas-balanced pedestal was launched in the 1950s. The pedestal enabled TV cameramen to track and jib all at the same time without losing sight of the viewfinder. Many thousands of the HP 419 design were sold worldwide. Very few remain in production use, often replaced by the later Vinten Fulmar.
Vinten Mk 3
The Vinten Mk 3 Pan & Tilt head used risers and cams to maintain the centre of gravity. This made the tilting of heavy cameras considerably easier and if correctly mounted a camera could be left at any tilt angle without lock off. The design (by William Vinten's son Bill) was highly innovative for the time.
Vinten OB Dolly
In the late 1950s Vinten's received a request via the BBC from the Queen. She asked for a less intrusive dolly to be used at Sandringham during the filming of the Royal Christmas Message. The Vinten Outside Broadcasting Dolly was designed to fulfill this requirement. The dolly, which ran on solid or pneumatic tyres, was quite narrow so it could be wheeled easily along a narrow passage or through a royal living room.
Vinten Plover
The Vinten Plover was a compact and relatively lightweight nitrogen-balanced studio/OB pedestal using a central three-stage column and three sets of linked wheels which could be either pneumatic or solid. The centre column could be separated from the wheeled base for transportation.
Vinten Fulmar
The Vinten Fulmar was a hugely popular studio pedestal featuring a three-stage column. Renowned for its smooth movement and robust design the Fulmar can still be found in studios worldwide despite being discontinued for many years.
Vinten Vector
Launched on 1993, the Vinten Vector range of pan and tilt heads are used for television studios and outside broadcast television production. The first Vector head, the Vector 70, was famous for its unique pantographic counterbalance mechanism that allowed heavy broadcast cameras to be balanced without the use of interchangeable cams. The Vector 700 and Vector 750, developed from the Vector 70, can be seen in use at nearly all major broadcasting events.
Vinten Vision
The Vinten Vision range of pan & tilt heads are used for lightweight cameras and camcorders. In 1988 the Design Council selected the Vision Range for display in the Design Centre, London, where the products were presented to the Duke of Edinburgh.
Vinten Quattro
The Vinten Quattro pedestal range was introduced in 1996 and features a four-stage column design that provides an on-shot stroke of 100 cm/39.4". The pedestal is now available in three versions: studio, outside broadcast and compact studio.
Vinten Vision blueBridge
By raising the centre of gravity of the camera sitting on a Vision blue head, the Vinten Vision blueBridge deliver perfect balance to lightweight DSLRs from just 1.5 kg/3.3lbs. The Vision blueBridge won the DVuser award at NAB2013.
Vinten Family.
Four out of William Vinten's five children worked for the company at some time. His two sons, Charles and Bill, inherited his engineering abilities and enthusiasm for technology and each became a nucleus for one of the company's two main activities: Charles focused on reconnaissance and Bill focused on television.
Bill Vinten OBE was trained as a cameraman and, like his father, was a keen inventor who was responsible for the development of many of the notable products mentioned above. He was awarded the 'Technical Achievement Award' from the Society of Camera Operators for his work on the Fulmar pedestal.
In 1993 Stuart Samson and Bill Vinten's son, Luke wrote 'Images of Success', a book about the history of Vinten.
The last formal link between the Vinten Group and the Vinten family ended when Bill Vinten resigned from the group board in September 1992 at the age of 72, having worked in the company for 43 years. Bill Vinten still lives close by in Bury St Edmunds, and although he is now in his 90s he continues to take an interest in the company.
The William Ellen Vinten trust was founded by the Vinten family to provide charitable donations to further the education and training of Vinten employees and people in the local area.

Forrest Edward Mars, Jr. (born August 16, 1931) is the eldest son of Forrest Mars, Sr. and the grandson of Frank C. Mars, the founder of Mars, Incorporated, the confectionary company. As a member of the Mars family, his share of the company and other assets were worth US$10 billion in September 2010,

Companies that hold the oil and gas leases to his land, rights originally made possible by the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and the Mineral Leasing Act, are seeking to exercise those rights on his ranch. Mars is reportedly concerned about the large amount of water that energy exploration and production projects consume, water needed by his ranch.
With the exception of a single donation supporting Bill Clinton in 1991, Mars has donated to the campaigns of Republicans.
Mars and his ex-wife donated the funds that made it possible for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation to reconstruct an 18th-century coffeehouse in Colonial Williamsburg.
The ex-couple made significant contributions to the privately owned governing body for Fort Ticonderoga, though a falling-out between Executive Director Nicholas Westbrook and Mrs. Mars led to her resignation from the board and the end of the then-couple's financial support.

ISAD(G)

ISAD(G) (General International Standard Archival Description) defines the elements that should be included in an archival finding aid. It was approved by the International Council on Archives (ICA/CIA) as a standard to register archival documents produced by corporations, persons and families.
Description.
ISAD (G) defines a list of elements and rules for the description of archives and describes the kinds of information that must and should be included in such descriptions.
ISAD(G) defines 26 data elements of which six are mandatory:
The standard provides a framework for a common approach, rather than a rigid format.
History.
After initial activities since 1988 supported by UNESCO, a subgroup of the AdHoc Commission on Descriptive Standards discussed the first draft from 1990. The first version was released in 1993/94. In 2000 the ICA published a revised version, the second edition, sometimes abbreviated as "ISAD(G)2" which remains the current standard.
ISAD(G) has been adopted as a standard by various members. In the US, for example, the local implementation of ISAD(G) is "" (2006).

The New Charles River Run is an annual running event consisting of three simultaneous races, 5 km, 7.5 miles and 7.5 mile relay, which takes place in Boston, Watertown and Cambridge, MA the last Sunday in June. Both courses are run entirely along the Charles River, making them extremely flat and fast.
In 2006, the starting and finishing lines were moved to their present location, the American Legion Marsh Post #442, 5 Greenough Boulevard, Cambridge. This location’s proximity to the Harvard Square MBTA station and a large parking lot at Artesani Park make it a convenient destination for both city and suburban runners.
A post-race party at the finish line features awards in 21 divisions, music, raffle, beer, barbecue, and ice cream.
The race has grown quickly, from 213 7 mile finishers and 126 5 km finishers in 2001 to 1097 7.5 mile finishers and 641 5 km finishers in 2008.

<doc id="21561404" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21561404" title="Lighting-up time">
Lighting-up time

In the United Kingdom there is a legally enforced lighting-up time, defined as from one half-hour after sunset to one half-hour before sunrise, during which all motor vehicles on unlit public roads (but not parked) must use their headlights.
Lighting-up time was first introduced in the nineteenth century in local by-laws and enforced nationally by the Lights on Vehicles Act of 1907. The Road Lighting Act of 1942 stipulated 1 hour after sunset/before dawn. It was amended to 30 minutes by the Road Traffic Act of 1956 because of the increasing speed of traffic. These were the required times for showing all lights on all vehicles, including bicycles and horse-drawn carts, hence the name "lighting-up time".
The (still current) Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations, 1989 tightened the requirements further. Lighting-up time is retained as the required period for use of motor vehicle headlights on roads without lit streetlights, but with that exception, all vehicles must now keep conspicuity lights lit during the longer period of sunset to sunrise (unless parked, either in a designated parking place or facing the same way as adjacent traffic and more than 10 m from the nearest junction on a road with a speed limit not exceeding 30 mph). The "conspicuity lights" required are "front and rear position lamps" (side and tail lights) plus, for large vehicles, side marker lamps and end-outline marker lamps and, for motor vehicles, rear number plate lights.
Headlights are also required at other times when visibility is restricted, e.g. by fog, rain, snow, overcast sky or smoke. They should also be used in tunnels.
Streetlights are usually set to come on automatically near the beginning of lighting-up time, although modern lamps monitor the light level and turn on when this gets too low, and so are influenced by weather. They may also be set to switch off automatically when road usage is reduced, often at midnight, although currently most stay on until about the end of lighting-up time. Headlamps must be used during lighting-up time unless streetlamps are alight.
Sunrise and sunset are defined by the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations as local sunrise and sunset so the times are different in different parts of the UK; they are earlier in the east and later in the west, and vary more with the seasons in northerly locations than in southerly locations.
Lighting-up times were formerly commonly displayed in national and local newspapers in the UK and announced on national and local radio stations, but the widespread adoption of street lighting has rendered this largely redundant. As a result, most of the previous sources no longer provide them, but may still provide sunrise / sunset times.

Thomas Risse (formerly Risse-Kappen) is a Berlin based international relations scholar. He currently acts as chair for “transnational relations, foreign- and security policy” at the Otto-Suhr Institute for Political Science at Freie Universität Berlin. Furthermore he has several engagements in German and international research networks, he also heads the PhD program of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin.
Thomas Risse is usually identified as a constructivist scholar of international relations. In contrast to American constructivists, his work borrows heavily from German social theory and philosophy, and in particular the work of Jürgen Habermas. His work suggests that communicative action can reshape actors' understanding of their interests with important consequences for world politics.
During the 1980s the main focus of his work laid on security policy, his dissertation “"Die Krise der Sicherheitspolitik"” (The Crisis of Security Policy) dealt with foreign and security policy decision making processes in West-Germany. In his thesis he observes the development of a Peace movement (opposed to the installation of medium-range rocket on German soil) and theorised their influence on West-German foreign policy. The contribution of his work is crucial to IR theory because it opposes the logic of equality between force and deterrence.
With the end of the Cold War, the focus of his work shifted to transnational relations and human rights. One of his works out of this period is the edited volume “Bringing Transnational Relations Back In”. Here he argues that regular interactions between non-state actors, that do not act on behalf of national governments, but try to influence the policies of a state, got out of focus. These organisations could be various NGOs for example, the Socialist International, Amnesty International or religious groups among others. In this volume an outlook on methodology and theory of transnational relations and their impact on domestic policy is developed. Another work of reference of this period is “Die Macht der Menschenrechte” (The Power of Human Rights). Based on liberal theory and democratic peace, Risse looks at international norms, speech acts and political change in the South. Whereby the main focus is laid on the realisation of human rights. His core theory is that the key for respect of human rights is the influence on transnational and domestic civil society on state structures. "Inter alia" he shows that economic development and democratisation do not forcibly go hand in hand.
Post 9/11 his focus changed again towards research on failed states and governance. In his latest publication he focussed on aspects of governance in failed states.

American School of Bombay, Mumbai

The American School of Bombay (or ASB) is a co-educational, international, day school in Mumbai, India.
Educational program/curriculum.
The American School of Bombay follows a college preparatory program that culminates with an American high school diploma or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.
Special programs.
Specialist teachers are provided for French, Spanish, Drama, Music, Art, PE, and Technology for grades ECEC (Early Childhood Education Center) through grade 12. The school offers after-school activities (ASB-E3) and athletics programs. The ASB-E3 includes: Arts and Crafts, Cooking, Hindi, Taekwondo, and others.

History.
In 1981, a group of international parents started the American School of Bombay with 12 students in a room at the American Consulate. The idea was to offer an educational program that would help students make an easy transition from one international school to another. As the school grew, it moved from the American Consulate to nearby residential apartments. In November 1998, the school moved to its current campus in Bandra, a Mumbai suburb.
Governance.
ASB is operated on a non-profit basis by the American School of Bombay Education Trust set up under the terms and conditions laid down by the Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi. The school is governed by a Board of Trustees, elected by the parents and faculty, for a two-year term.

History.
Past & Present of Kattoor
The history of Kattoor grama panchayath originates only after the formation of the panchayath in the year 1952 AD. In fact before the formation of the panchayath there were not much more specific reports to the path of future to indulge as a historical background of this place. After starting freedom struggle a few patriots have marked their name in that movement. In other way we can say they have rendered sincere contribution by participating in the freedom struggle.
History of kattoor Panchayath
The area of Kattor panchayath was 25 square km at the very beginning of its formation. This Panchayath has been covered by Kattoor, Karalam village and a part of Manavalassery village. During the year 1977 AD, this panchayath has been divided and a new panchayath has been formed in the name of Karalam Grama panchayth.
Border of Panchayth
The border of the present Kattoor grama Panchayath are as follows.
At the very beginning of Kattoor Grama Panchayath, office and related offices were functioning at Ponjanam, one km east of Kattoor School junction, in a rented building. Roman Catholic church authorities had donated the land to the authorities concerned to build its own building for panchayath. Before independence of India, Government of Kochi has constructed this panchayath building in the year 1937 in the land given by Roman Catholic church.
If we are trying to penetrate to the yesterdays of Kattoor the history goes to old Kochi. The western border of Kattoor is Kanoli Cannal the other side of the cannal is old Malabar. The cultural and religious life style of old Kochi and old Malabar have influenced the life style of the people of Katoor.
The people of Kattoor and the surrounding places depends on agriculture and trade to meet their daily bread. A good number of people depends upon different kinds of works of related cultivation and trade of these places.
How the name 'KATTOOR' originated?
From the ancient period onwards their place was known as Kattoor. It is believed the reason for originating the name as KATTOOR the surrounding places Vetha Kad,Chekkad, Pudukkad, Thazekkad, Mannookad, Karakkad, Illikad etc. were influenced to call their places as Kattoor in Malayalam."Kad or Kat" is having a meaning of forest and nad" is meant for the apt place for living with civilized circumstances. Though this place is known as Kattoor means the 'oor' of a 'Kad'. In Malayalam 'Oor' means 'Nad' in an elaborated form 'nad 'of a 'Kad'. Though the name meant such.
PRE HISTORY PERIOD.
During the period between 1500 AD and 1600 AD, after the arrival of Portuguese due to their special interest, this area has been made a trade center. Hence this Kattoor and near by places had developed a lot. Different kinds of trade have been developed on the banks of Kanoli Canal in Kattoor and Edathuruthy, (the eastern part of Malabar). Kattoor and Edathuruthy busar - known as 'Chantha' and 'Angady'- was famous for trading.
In the pre-history period of Kattor there were lesser proximity of conveyance by road and transportable public roads are very rare in Kattoor like other places. Transportation was mainly made through water boat service. Kodungalloor, Kochi etc. were the main trade centers connecting with Kattoor by this water ways. The main cause of the development of these places were the trade introduced by the Portuguese.
Kattoor Angady.
The Kattoor "Angady", well known for the early morning market, is situated in the banks of Kanoli Canal, which form most of the west boundary of Kattoor. Kattoor Angady has a ""Chantha"" (Commodity Exchange). It was famous due to its historical unique position. It is near to Kanoli Canal, it was close to old state borders and it has proximity to Arabian Sea. 
Kattoor side of Kanoli Canal was a part of Travancore Cochin and the other side, Edamuttam side, was a part of Malabar District which was an administrative district of British India. During the period of British empire, Kanoli Canal connected the north end to the south end of the State. Main propose of Kanoli Canal was transportation of goods. This canal is also connected to Arabian Sea. Old days, for a trading boat comes from Arabian Sea through Kanoli Canal, Kattoor was the nearest main market place. Due to these reasons Kattor "Chantha" was Popular for exotic commodities comes from far distance. Merchants and farmers from nearby villages used to come to Kattoor "Chantha" to buy and sell goods and produces.

Trams in France

Trams in France go back to 1837 when a 15 km steam tram line connected Montrond-les-Bains and Montbrison in the Loire. With the development of electric trams at the end of the 19th century, networks proliferated in French cities over a period of 15 years. Although nearly all of the country's tram systems were replaced by bus services in the 1930s or shortly after the Second World War, France is now in the forefront of the revival of tramways and light rail systems around the globe. Only trams lines in Lille and Saint-Étienne have operated continuously since the 19th century. Since the opening of the Nantes tramway in 1985, more than twenty towns and cities across France have built new tram lines. As of 2013, there are 25 operational tram networks in France, with 3 under construction and 4 more planned. France is also home to Alstom, a leading tram manufacturer.
History.
The girder rail.
One of the key inventions in the world history of trams was that of the girder rail developed in 1852 by Frenchman Alphonse Loubat. It brought the tram track down to road level, avoiding accidents to pedestrians and other vehicles caused by the standard protruding rail used until then. Inspired by John Stephenson of New York, it was in Paris that Loubat built the first line of this type, for horse trams, which was inaugurated on 21 November 1853 in connection with the 1855 World Fair. On a trial basis, it ran along the banks of the Seine from the Place de la Concorde to the Pont de Sèvres in the village of Boulogne.
Horse trams.
Several French cities were equipped with horse-tram networks towards the end of the 19th century. In Paris, Tramways Sud operated horse trams from 1875 to 1901. In Marseille, horse trams operated by Compagnie Générale Française de Tramways entered service in 1876 on a number of routes including the Canebière. In Strasbourg, horse tram services began in 1877.
Mechanical traction.
As horse trams presented a number of disadvantages (need for several teams of horses per vehicle per day, relatively slow speed, droppings on the roadway), it was not long before various mechanical traction systems came into use. These included:
Electrification.
Although Werner von Siemens demonstrated the electric tram in 1881 at the International Electrical Exhibition in Paris, it was not until 1890 that the first électric tram was opened in Clermont-Ferrand, and in 1895 the Tramway de Versailles was converted from steam power to electric power. While electricity offered considerable benefits including ease of operation, many municipalities were reluctant to bring overhead cabling into their city centres. Nevertheless, over the next 15 years, well over 100 standard and small gauge electric tram networks came into operation.
Post-war closures.
Most of France's tram systems closed during the 1930s or in the post-war years. The only systems which have remained in continuous use are those in Lille, Marseille and Saint-Étienne but even these were extensively reduced in size before the recent revival.
Today's tram networks.
Over the past 30 years, a rapidly growing number of France's cities have developed modern tramways or light rail networks. At present, there are 22 modern tram systems spread right across the country (excluding the three trams-on-tyres services). Many of these are being extended while at least seven other municipalities are in the process of planning or acquiring new tram networks.
Key developments.
There has also been a strong emphasis on tramway innovations such as ground level power supply in Bordeaux and trams on tyres in Nancy.
Current tramway systems.
The following French towns and cities now have light rail or tram systems: 
In addition to the above French tram systems, two tramways cross the border into France from neighbouring countries, although in both cases the proportion of the system in France is quite small:
Future lines.
Systems are under construction in Aubagne and Besançon. Trams are planned for Amiens, Avignon, Lens, Nîmes and outside of metropolitan France in Fort-de-France
. Extensions to the Geneva network into France are also planned.
Recent technical developments.
The revival of tram networks in France has brought about a number of technical developments both in the traction systems and in the styling of the vehicles.
Trams on tyres.
A recent development of tramway technology has been the guided bus (or tram on tyres), a rubber-tyred vehicle guided by a fixed rail in the ground, which draws current from overhead electric wires like a conventional tram.
Two incompatible systems exist: 
In both cases the weight of the vehicle is borne by rubber tyres on bogies to which the guide wheels are attached. Power is supplied by overhead lines, or by rechargeable batteries in areas where there are no overhead wires.
The Translohr system is intended for guidance-only operation, whereas the Bombardier system can be driven as a normal bus as requirements dictate, such as journeys to the depot. Unlike rail trams, the vehicles have a steering wheel, though it is not used when following the guidance rail. Because the Translohr tram cannot move without guidance, it is not classified as a bus. Hence the Translohr vehicles in Clermont-Ferrand are not equipped with licence plates.
APS third rail.
The ground-level power supply system known as APS or Alimentation par le sol uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre segments with three-metre neutral sections in between. Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are antennas that send radio signals to energise the power rail segments as the tram passes over them. At any one time, no more than two consecutive segments under the tram should actually be live. Alstrom developed the system primarily to avoid intrusive power supply cables in the sensitive area of the old city of Bordeaux.
Modern styling.
The Eurotram used in Strasbourg, Milan and Porto was developed by Socimi of Italy. The Eurotram has a modern design that makes it look almost as much like a train as a tram, and has large windows along its entire length.
Modular design.
The Citadis tram, flagship of the French manufacturer Alstom, enjoys an innovative design combining lighter bogies with a modular concept for carriages offering more choices in the types of windows and the number of cars and doors. The recent Citadis-Dualis, intended to run at up to 100 km/h, is suitable for stop spacings ranging from 500 m to 5 km. Dualis is a strictly modular partial low-floor car, with all doors in the low-floor sections.
Tramway museum lines.
In addition to recent developments in France's urban areas, the Deûle Valley tram museum line operates near Lille. It runs along a 3 km track from Marquette-lez-Lille to Wambrechies and features several tram vehicles dating back to the beginning of the 20th century.

Oskar Schäfer

Oskar Schäfer (16 January 1921 – 22 November 2011) was a Untersturmführer (Second Lieutenant) in the Waffen-SS during World War II, who was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, which was awarded to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership by Nazi Germany during World War II.
Early life.
Schäfer was born on 16 January 1921 in Nixdorf in the Sudetenland. After completing his high school education in November 1938, he volunteered to join the SS-VT and was assigned to the 12th Company, SS Standarte (Regiment) "Deutschland".
World War II.
Schäfer took part in the Polish Campaign, the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) as an infantryman, almost reaching the gates of Moscow, with the 2nd SS Division "Das Reich" and was seriously wounded in the head.
After recovering from his wounds he was transferred to the SS Panzer Battalion 5, of the 5th SS Panzer Division "Wiking" serving in the south of the Eastern Front.
His time with SS "Wiking" lasted until 1943 when he was posted back to Germany to help train and form a new SS Battalion in the Armour school at Sennelager. This new Battalion the 103 SS Heavy Panzer Battalion would use the Tiger tank.
He deployed back to the Eastern Front with the Battalion, in command of the 3rd Company, of the now named 503 SS Heavy Panzer Battalion in the spring on 1945 and took part in the fighting at Arnswalde and Stargard. He was again seriously wounded but managed to escape from the Russian encirclement at Kolberg and reach Greifswald.
Back with the rest of the Battalion he prepared for the Russian assault across the River Oder and the defence of Berlin. Now commanding a King Tiger he was wounded again with first degree burns.
On the 28 April while fighting in the Zähringer Strasse area of Wilmersdorf he was ordered to attend the Führerbunker to be awarded the Knight's Cross.
The award was presented by Wilhelm Mohnke who also enlisted Schäfers help in the planned breakout from Berlin on 2 May 1945. His Tiger II leading the Mohnke group was hit crossing the Heer Strasse by a Russian JS II tank. Schäfer was again seriously wounded suffered further burns, temporarily lost his sight and lost his memory.
Post war.
Schäfer remained in hospital after the end of the war recovering from his wounds, and was not released until 1947.

Robert Manno

Robert Manno (b. 1944, Bryn Mawr, Pa) is the composer of numerous chamber and orchestral works, song cycles and solo piano and choral works. The Atlanta Audio Society has called him "a composer of serious music of considerable depth and spiritual beauty." Ned Rorem has described his music as “maximally personal and expressive” and "Fanfare" Magazine has said: "his instrumental compositions are shot through with powerful lyrical impulses...Manno’s music, in whatever guise, always sings."
Biography.
After early instruction in piano and violin, Manno had a brief career as a jazz pianist in Philadelphia, then studied voice with Dolores Ferraro and composition with Romeo Cascarino. He moved to New York in 1965 studying jazz piano with John Mehegan and Steve Kuhn and voice with Cornelius Reid. He later continued his composition studies at the 28th Annual Composers Conference in Johnson, VT with Donald Erb and Mario Davidovsky.
Manno has received the Ernest Bloch Award, First Prize at the Delius Festival and many Meet the Composer Grants and ASCAP Awards. His music has been performed throughout the US, Italy and Wales, UK and has been broadcast on American Public Media’s "Performance Today".
He holds a degree in voice from the Manhattan School of Music and an M.A. in music composition from New York University. He was a member of both the MET Chorus (1977-2001) and NYCO Chorus (1967–77) and appeared as a baritone soloist in recital, chamber music programs, and with the Westchester Symphony and Alvin Ailey Dance Company. After leaving the MET Chorus, he served as an assistant conductor at the MET in 2002 working backstage on Rigoletto and Falstaff (with James Levine and Bryn Terfel).
He and his wife, former MET violinist Magdalena Golczewski, reside in the Northern Catskills where they formed the Windham Chamber Music Festival, a concert series now in its thirteenth season. He is Music Director and Conductor of the Windham Festival Chamber Orchestra and Catskill Mountain Chamber Orchestra.

Early in the 13th century the nave was replaced with one with north and south aisles and a higher roof. Early in the 14th century the chancel and both aisles were rebuilt and the south aisle and chancel were given new Decorated Gothic windows. Little of the 13th century nave and aisles now survives except the west wall and three Early English doorways. A clerestory was added to the nave and a porch was added to the repositioned south door. The tower buttresses may have been added at this time. Early in the 15th century the north wall of the north aisle was rebuilt, retaining the 13th century north doorway but gaining new Perpendicular Gothic
windows. In about 1600 the west window was replaced with a three-light square-headed one.
Early in the 17th century the chancel was in disrepair and the lay rector was repeatedly asked to fund repairs. In 1621 the chancel was reported to be so "ruinous and much decayed" that the rain came in. In 1632 the rest of the church was alleged to be "ready to fall". The tracery, in part of the east window, was rebuilt c1760 and two of the north windows of the chancel was replaced.
By 1879 St. Etheldreda's needed a thorough restoration and the vicar privately wrote that he feared for the safety of the tower. However, the tower was not put in good order until 1915, when church was restored under the direction of the Scottish architect William Weir.
In 1947–50 the Oxford Diocesan Surveyor T. Lawrence Dale added a chancel screen and rood loft. Dale described this work as "One of the most enjoyable things he ever did", likening it to "putting new wine into an old bottle".
St. Etheldreda's interior has Mediaeval wall paintings: a large and well-preserved one of Saint Christopher, on the north wall, and a rare one of Saint Zita, on the north nave pillar. 
The tower was repaired in 1785; a stair parapet was removed early in the 19th century. It had a ring of four bells, cast by William and Henry III Bagley of Chacombe in 1706. but two further bells, by John Taylor & Co, were added in 2013. 
St. Etheldreda's is now one of eight ecclesiastical parishes in the Ironstone Benefice.
Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway.
The Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway was built during The First World War to carry ironstone from a quarry west of Horley to a junction with the Great Western Railway just north of Banbury. The ironstone railway passed just south of Horley, where a concrete bridge carried the railway over the Horley–Wroxton road. The railway was opened in 1917 and closed in 1967.

Chiteiki

, also known as Chitei no Ki, is one of the representative kanbun texts of the mid Heian period. Belonging to the zuihitsu genre, it was written by Yoshishige no Yasutane (:ja:慶滋保胤) in 982. The text is a valuable resource for understanding social issues within the capital at the time.
Background.
Yasutane drew inspiration for his text from Bai Juyi's "Chi Shang Pian" (池上篇) and Kane Akira's book by the same title.
The short text is contained with volume 12 of the "Honchō Monzui". It is composed of two major sections. The first is a commentary on problems within the society. Noteworthy are the descriptions of the capital: the west side has gone to ruin and people live crowded on the east side. Due to these issues, in the second half Yasutane goes into seclusion. He builds a small house where he can live a free lifestyle away from worldly cares.
Influences.
"Chiteiki" is primarily cited as having a major influence on Kamo no Chōmei's later "Hōjōki" (written around 1212). In "Hōjōki", Chōmei mimics a number of literary devices found in "Chiteiki", describes similar social problems, and eventually goes into seclusion building a small hut.

Talarozole

Talarozole (formerly R115866, planned trade name Rambazole) is an investigational drug for the treatment of acne, psoriasis and other keratinization disorders.
Talarozole inhibits the metabolism of retinoic acid by blocking the cytochrome P450 enzyme isoform CYP26, a retinoic acid hydroxylase. Because of this mechanism, it is called a retinoic acid metabolism blocking agent (RAMBA).

Brandon Neely

Brandon Neely is a former Army guard at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, in Cuba.
Neely is notable for agreeing to be interviewed by the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas at the University of California, at Davis.
Neely declined to respond to a recall to active duty from the Individual Ready Reserve in 2007.
Neely reported that, after receiving letters from the Department of Defense, he was sent an honorable discharge from the Army Reserve.
In January 2010, Neely flew to the United Kingdom and met with former captives.
Neely and Ruhal Ahmed and Shafiq Rasul reconnected in 2009 via Rasul's Facebook page.
The "BBC Radio" was scheduled to air a documentary about the meeting on January 14, 2010.
Guantanamo duty.
Neely was a guard at Guantanamo for the first six months the camp was open, and described feeling guilty for the brutal treatment captives received at that time.
In an interview with Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas Neely said that he and another guard experienced the first resistant prisoner for whom a "code red" (a euphemism for a violent extrajudicial punishment) was called, calling in the camp's first use of its immediate reaction force. 
He described how he and the other guard were trying to get a captive to kneel, so they could remove the captive's shackles. He could feel the captive trembling, and his body tense up. He and the other guard threw the elderly man to his cell's concrete floor, and called for the immediate reaction force. Neely described learning later that the reason the captive was shaking, and his body was so tense, was that he believed he was being made to kneel in preparation for his summary execution—a bullet to the back of the head.
Neely described watching a medic calling upon the immediate reaction force to hold an underweight captive immobile so he could force him to drink a can of ensure. 
When the captive wouldn't open his mouth, Neely said the medic asked Neely to move, and then punched the captive twice in the face. Neely said he only realized afterwards that the medic had him move to a point where Neely's body blocked the medics punches from the guards in the guard tower. He said later learned that the captive resisted drinking the diet supplement because he feared it was poisonous.
Neely said that he saw camp medical staff perform a rectal examination, searching for contraband, without first lubricating their fingers, and that this made the captive scream in pain. 
Neely said that it had been a friend of his who was the first guard the captives saw drop a Koran on the ground. 
He said that this incident upset the captives so much it triggered a camp-wide hunger strike. While the Colonel in command of their unit said the guard who dropped the koran would be punished, his friend was never punished.
Neely said that female guards used to regularly take their turns escorting captives to the open-air showers, and that the captives felt humiliated to be exposed, naked, in front of the female guard. 
Neely said that camp authorities told the guards they could not leave Guantanamo for their next assignment unless they signed a confidentiality agreement, promising not to give interviews about Guantanamo, or to write about their experiences there themselves.
Civilian life.
Brandon Neely is the former president of the Houston chapter of Iraq Veterans Against the War.
Brandon Neely resigns from IVAW in early 2008 citing IVAW was becoming radical and anti-American.
Neely became a police officer after his discharge in 2005.
