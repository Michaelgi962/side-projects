Licola, Victoria

Licola is a town in Victoria, Australia, located on Licola Road, in the Shire of Wellington, 254 kilometres east of Melbourne. At the 2006 census, Licola and the surrounding area had a population of 21.
The Lions Club owns a large section of land in Licola and operates a youth camp on site, the Lions Wilderness Village, which is immediately surrounded by farm land. The town is the southern gateway to the Alpine National Park. Its main industries are tourism, logging and farming. It has one general store including post office and petrol station and a small number of houses. It is also the only Victorian town not connected to the mains electricity grid, generating its own power. The town is frequented by motorbike riders, campers and hikers alike.
The first Licola Post Office opened on 14 September 1908 and was renamed Glenfalloch in 1912. A Licola Post Office was again open 1914–1919, 1920–1923 and 1954–1993.
In July 2007, Licola suffered serious floods which caused a great deal of damage to roads, farms and national park areas. The main road from Heyfield was closed for two months following the destruction of the heritage-listed Cheynes Bridge, which was subsequently rebuilt.

Porter Subdivision

The Porter Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the Chicago, Illinois area. Formerly a part of the main line of the Michigan Central Railroad, it now connects CSX's former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line and the Chicago Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad from the east with the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad towards Blue Island, Illinois.
History.
The Michigan Central Railroad built a line from Detroit, Michigan to Chicago, Illinois, opening in mid-1852, several months after the competing Northern Indiana and Chicago Railroad (later the New York Central Railroad's main line) was completed. The MC's path entered Indiana near Michigan City, crossing the NI&C at Porter. From Porter it looped to the southwest and northwest, joining the Illinois Central Railroad at Kensington, Illinois south of Chicago. Later the Michigan Central (and the Northern Indiana and Chicago's successor, the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway) came under control of the New York Central.
Eventually the NYC started to operate most trains west from Porter via the LS&MS, and the MC became a secondary route. All passenger trains moved on January 18, 1957, ending service to local stations in Gary and Hammond. In 1964 the NYC merged into Penn Central Transportation, and into Conrail in 1976. Around then the diamonds were removed at Porter, physically separating the line to Detroit from the line to Kensington, which came to be known as the Porter Branch. After 1980 Amtrak bought the line from Porter to Michigan City, Indiana, east of which they already owned to Kalamazoo, Michigan, about 2/5 the way to Detroit.
With the 1998 breakup of Conrail, CSX Transportation acquired the branch, by then only running from Porter west to Gibson, Indiana, a junction with the east-west Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad and the north-south Kankakee Line, transferred from Conrail to the Norfolk Southern Railway. CSX has trackage rights on the IHB to and beyond Blue Island, with various connections to other CSX lines including the Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad (Blue Island Subdivision). To the east, a connection existed at Tolleston to the Fort Wayne Secondary, also acquired in the 1998 Conrail breakup (though from the Norfolk Southern Railway). At Willow Creek, as part of the breakup, a new connection was built connecting CSX's ex-Baltimore and Ohio Railroad main line (the Garrett Subdivision) to the Porter Branch. In 2004 the little-used Fort Wayne Subdivision was leased to the Chicago Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad.
At Porter, despite the existence of a CSX line to the northeast - the ex-Pere Marquette Railway Grand Rapids Subdivision - no connection exists across the Norfolk Southern Railway's ex-New York Central Railroad Chicago Line. CSX has considered putting in diamonds, but has held off for now (they use NS west of Porter to reach their Grand Rapids Subdivision). Thus CSX does not currently use the Porter Branch east of the junction at Willow Creek, but the BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad use it via trackage rights to reach Norfolk Southern's Elkhart Yard in Elkhart, Indiana.

Archer (horse)

Archer (1856–1872) was an Australian Thoroughbred racehorse who won the first and the second Melbourne Cups in 1861 and 1862. He won both Cups easily, and is one of only five horses to win the Melbourne Cup twice or more; he is one of only four horses to win two successive Cups.
Breeding.
Archer was sired by the successful imported sire William Tell (GB) (1843, by Touchstone); his dam, Maid of the Oaks (dam of Mariner and William Tell (1855)) was by Vagabond (GB) (by Cain). Archer's sire and dam had been owned by Thomas Molyneux "Tom" Royds (1824–1852) of Ballalaba, Jembaicumbene, New South Wales. Royds formed a breeding partnership with his uncle-in-law Andrew Badgery (c.1804–1857), keeping their many horses on the Andrew Badgery managed Exeter Farm in Jembaicumbene. For £51, Royds purchased the mare Maid Of The Oaks at the dispersal of Charles Smith's Clifton Stud in 1845. Royds also imported the stallion Sailor By The Sea, and in February 1847 the stallion William Tell. Archer’s full-sister, Our Nell, won three races in four days at the Goulburn races (1855) and other races at city tracks.
Early life.
Archer was probably foaled in 1856 at Exeter Farm in Jembaicumbene, near Braidwood in New South Wales. In recent years evidence has been discovered that Archer may not have been foaled on the Exeter Farm owned by Roberts but on Royd's previous cattle farm Ballabala, owned by Hassall. This is supported by Richard William Royds' (1922-?) (one of William Edward Royd's grandsons) writing in 1983 that Archer was foaled at Ballabala; this view is supported by his widow and adopted son. All other references state that Archer was foaled at Exeter Farm, including Richard's older brother John Patrick Molyneux Royds (1920-?) in an interview published in 1969. It is also on Exeter Farm that other horses from the breeding partnership of Hassall and Roberts were foaled, including Archer's half-brother Mariner in 1854 (by Sailor By The Sea out of Maid Of The Oaks) and his full-brother William Tell in 1855 (by William Tell (GB) out of Maid Of The Oaks.
Royds died at age 27 in an accident in early 1852. Two years later, his widow Elizabeth Jane "Betsy" Royds (née Roberts) (1824–1875) married Rowland H. Hassall (1820–1904) of Durham Hall in Jembaicumben who, under the laws of the time, obtained all of Betsy's possessions at their marriage. Even though Royds' will gave him no right to do so, Hassall began selling off the Royds horses at Exeter Farm. Betsy persuaded Hassell to keep the imported stallion William Tell and six broodmares (one of which was Maid Of The Oaks). Her brother Thomas John "Tom" Roberts (1831–1899) had inherited Exeter Farm, and as executor of Royds' estate was trying to protect the interests of his nephews; he would care for the horses. As part of the agreement, the progeny (including Archer) from the breeding program using the six mares bred to William Tell and other stallions were recorded in the stud books under the breeding partnership name of (RH) Hassell and (TJ) Roberts. The names of the two boys to whom the horses had been bequeathed, Edmund Molyneux Royds (1847–1912) (no issue) and William Edward Royds (1849–1910), were not mentioned. When the boys sued their stepfather in the 1870s their interests were finally recognised, and the breeding partnership was renamed Hassell, Roberts and Royds.
Newspaper archives of the day state that Archer travelled south from Sydney to Port Melbourne on the steamboat the "City of Sydney" with two of his trainer Etienne de Mestre’s other horses Exeter and Inheritor, leaving on 18 September 1861 and arriving at Port Melbourne on 21 September. Prior to the Melbourne trip, the horses had arrived in Sydney by steamer from Greenwell Point (near Nowra) on 9 September. Passengers on the "City of Sydney" included de Mestre and Archer's jockey, John Cutts. Archer travelled by steamboat from Sydney to Melbourne all three times that he raced in Victoria (in 1861, 1862 and 1863). Before railway facilities linked Melbourne to the other states, the only way to transport horses from state to state was by boat. In 1876 de Mestre's entry in the Melbourne Cup, Robin Hood, and ten other horses were lost at sea when the "City Of Melbourne" was struck by a severe storm off the coast at Jervis Bay.
A steamboat was also the vehicle that de Mestre used to get his horses (including Archer) to Sydney. His horses usually boarded a steamer at Adam's Whalf {near Terara) but due to floods in early 1860 impeding navigation, from 1860 to 1863 the horses walked eight miles (13 km) to Berry's Whalf at Greenwell Point. When horses could not be transported by steamboat, and where railway lines did not exist, trainers needed to have their horses walked and/or ridden to their destinations. In order to race at Windsor Archer would have been sent by steamship or rail from Sydney to Parramatta and overland the last 21 miles (34 km), and in order to race at Maitland Archer would have been sent by steamship to Newcastle and overland the last 20 miles (32 km). The longest distance that Archer would have walked or been ridden was 155 miles (250 km) from the end of the railway line in Campbelltown to Jembaicumbene when he retired from racing in 1864.
Another Archer story is that his jockey for the first two Melbourne Cups, John Cutts (c. 1829–1872), was an Aborigine. Johnny Cutts was (according to legend) born in the area around Nowra, and one of many Aboriginal men who replaced white stockmen who walked off the land to join the gold rush. In truth Johnny Cutts rode for many trainers in his long career as a jockey, was not from the Nowra area, and was never based there. Cutts' brother-in-law Walter Bradbury, however, lived at Terara (since he worked for de Mestre) and helped to train Archer. John Cutts Dillon was the son of a Sydney clerk and one of the best-known, best-liked and most-respected jockeys in New South Wales.
Racing career.
In 1860 Archer was bought and trained by business associate and school friend of Tom Roberts Etienne de Mestre (1832–1916), from Terara near Nowra, New South Wales. De Mestre (who would go on to train four Melbourne Cup winners and win five Melbourne Cups) was the son of Sydney businessman Prosper de Mestre (1789–1844). Although Archer raced in Etienne de Mestre's name, Archer was not legally owned by de Mestre. De Mestre leased some of his horses from Hassall and Roberts for training and racing purposes including Mariner (Archer's older half-brother), Archer and Tim Whiffler (with whom he won the 1867 Melbourne Cup). As a lessee, de Mestre "owned" (was fully responsible for) the horses during their leases. 
Archer was three years old when de Mestre began his training at Terara (near Nowra) in May 1860. Nicknamed "The Bull" by locals, Archer was considered large for a three-year-old; he stood 16.3 hands with powerful hindquarters, a deep girth, well-sprung ribs and a good head and neck. His idiosyncrasies included his curious rolling gait when galloping, and the fact that he galloped with his tongue lolling out of his mouth. He was a long-striding horse, who could cover in 16 strides. Archer’s large frame told on his legs, and he was frequently lame. Archer was lightly regarded after he ran badly in his first two races at Randwick in late May 1860. However, at the spring meeting later that year and the autumn meeting of 1861 he was undefeated in seven New South Wales races.
The inaugural two-mile Melbourne Cup on 7 November 1861 at Flemington was an eventful affair. Three of the seventeen starters fell during the race (two of them died); two jockeys sustained broken bones; one horse bolted off the course, but the race continued. At the final turn the favourite, Mormon, made his run but Archer caught and passed him. Before a crowd of about 4,000, Archer (a Sydney outsider, who was injured during training a few days before the race and attracted slight betting interest) defeated Mormon by six lengths in a time of 3:52.0 – the slowest time in Melbourne Cup history. Archer also defeated Mormon at Randwick in May over 2½ miles in the Australia Plate. In the first Melbourne Cup Archer won for de Mestre his prize was the sweepstake, 710 gold sovereigns (1 sovereign = £1), and a trophy (a hand-beaten gold watch). Before the race Archer was dismissed by the bookies, but after de Mestre of Terara made his wager Archer’s odds shortened and he started as the 6-1 second favourite. The winning bets on Archer took money from Melbourne, "refuelling interstate rivalry" and adding to the excitement of the Cup. The next day, Archer won another two-mile race at Flemington (the Melbourne Town Plate) with the same time.
In May 1862 Archer won the three-mile AJC Queen's Plate, and on 7 June 1862 Archer and Exeter were shipped back to Melbourne for the second Melbourne Cup. Archer was the Cup favourite; to prepare for the race, he was sent by railway from Melbourne to Geelong. In his first race in five months, Archer ran third on 1 October in the fifth three-mile Champion Sweepstakes.
Six weeks later (on 13 November 1862) Archer won his second Melbourne Cup carrying –  – at 2–1 odds in a time of 3:47.0. The race, held before a crowd of about 7,000 (nearly double the previous year's crowd), had 20 starters – the largest field of horses ever to start in Australia at that time. Again it was an exciting race; Cutts initially reined Archer back so that he was running last by several lengths, and appeared to be out of the running. He then gradually passed his opponents until reaching the leaders, when the long-striding horse galloped into first place. Archer won by eight lengths, with Mormon again running second. His winning margin is the Melbourne Cup record, unmatched until 1969 by Rain Lover. With a larger field meaning a larger sweepstake, Archer won 810 gold sovereigns and a trophy (a hand-beaten gold watch). Winning the Melbourne Cup two years in a row was a feat not repeated until Peter Pan won the race twice more than 70 years later. Two days later, Archer won the one-mile All-Aged Stakes at Flemington. Archer, Exeter and de Mestre arrived back in Sydney on the steamer "Wonga Wonga" on 29 November. The following week they caught another steamer to Wollongong, and traveled overland the 50 miles (80 km) to Terara.
A technicality resulted in Archer's being denied a third try at the Melbourne Cup. His telegraphed acceptance to race failed to arrive in time (delivery was delayed due to a public holiday in Melbourne), and Archer was refused permission to enter the race. Nominations for the 1863 Melbourne Cup had to be lodged with the Victorian Turf Club by Wednesday, 29 April, accompanied by five gold sovereigns. De Mestre had nominated two of his horses, Archer and Haidee. Weights were declared and published in "Bell's Life" in Sydney on Saturday, 9 May. Archer was to carry 11 st 4 lb (71.82 kg, or 158 lb) - which, if he had raced, would have been the heaviest handicap in the history of the Melbourne Cup. Under the care of groom and trainer Tom Lamond Archer and Haidee steamed to Melbourne, leaving Sydney on the "City Of Melbourne" Tuesday, 16 June. Acceptance, with an additional five-sovereign payment, had to be lodged with the VTC by 8pm Wednesday, 1 July; de Mestre (still in Sydney) had overlooked the deadline. Reminded on the morning of 1 July by Sam Jenner of George Kirk & Co. of the deadline, de Mestre requested a telegram be sent to the Melbourne office of George Kirk & Co. asking them to accept on his behalf. De Mestre took the telegram to the telegraph office himself, and it was received in the Melbourne Telegraph Office at 1 pm. Wednesday, 1 July was a public holiday in Melbourne, and the telegram was not delivered to the George Kirk & Co. offices until 7:30 pm. The next morning George Kirk handed the telegram to the stewards at the Turf Club, who decided it was too late. This decision caused controversy amongst Archer's Sydney supporters, who had expected him to win. Pressure by Victorian owners made no difference to the VTC, which stood its ground. To protest this decision and show solidarity, the interstate entrants boycotted the third Cup. Unknown at the time, however, was that due to injury Archer would have been unlikely to race. The third Melbourne Cup ran with only seven Victoria horses, the smallest number in its history.
On 21 July de Mestre took the steamer "City of Melbourne" to Melbourne to oversee the training of his horses for the seventh Champion Sweepstakes at Ballarat on 1 October. Once again John Cutts was engaged to ride Archer, and he steamed to Melbourne on 4 August aboard the "Rangatira". De Mestre's horses were sent from Melbourne to Ballarat by railway. During his training Archer was ill, lame and required veterinary care, and did not race well. His supporters angrily asked why de Mestre had not scratched him from the race. In reply, Rowland Hassall issued a statement that none of de Mestre's horses were public property. On 10 October, it was announced that Archer had "gone in one of his legs" after the race; the next day, he was scratched from all his Victoria engagements.
Brought to Sydney to prepare for the September Metropolitan Cup at Randwick Racecourse, Archer was seriously injured a month before the race during a veterinary treatment on 10 August 1864. He survived, and resumed training as soon as possible; however, he was ultimately scratched from the race. At the conclusion of the Randwick meeting, Archer was retired and returned to his owners Hassell and Roberts on Exeter Farm at Jembaicumbene, near where he had been foaled. This involved a rail trip from Sydney to Campbelltown, and an overland trip of 155 miles (250 km).
Race record.
u/k = unknown
s = gold sovereign
1s = £1
1 mile = 1.6 km
Stud record.
Archer was retired to stud at a fee of 10 guineas per mare (one of the highest stud fees of the time), but his progeny did not win a stakes race. He remained at Exeter Farm until his death at age 16 on 22 December 1872. He had wandered into a field of green barley, the consumption of which gave him a fatal inflammation of the lungs. Archer's jockey, John Cutts, had died three months earlier in September 1872.
Victorian craftswoman Therese Haynes was so enamoured of Archer that late in his life, she made a horseshoe ornament from his tail hair. She coiled the hair to create a horseshoe-shaped plaque, placed it in a silver setting and mounted it on red satin. Preserving relics from celebrities – a category that in Australia has often included horses – was a strong Victorian-era pastime. Today this piece of memorabilia can be found at the Australian Racing Museum in Melbourne.

LEAK

LEAK is the brand name for high-fidelity audio equipment made by H. J. Leak & Co. Ltd, of London, England. The company was founded in 1934 by Harold Joseph Leak and was sold to the Rank Organisation in January 1969. During the 1950s and 60s, the company produced high-quality amplifiers, radio tuners, loudspeakers (the LEAK Sandwich), pickups, arms and a turntable. The sale of the business to Rank saw an expanded range of models, and considerable further development of loudspeakers, but Rank was not able to position the brand to counter competition from Japanese electronics manufacturers, so by the late 1970s electronics and speaker production ceased under the LEAK name.
Early days.
The company initially focussed on provision of amplifiers for public address systems and theatres, with only a few staff. Typical designs used were similar to those found in the Partridge Public Address Manuals of the time, which used Osram's DA30 power triodes in push-pull for 45 watts output.
During the latter part of the Second World War, the company started developing amplifiers that made extensive use of negative feedback to achieve very high performance. This approach had been invented by Harold Black of Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1934, but it was slow to emerge as popular method for controlling amplifier performance.
Point One.
In September 1945 the company released the first of the "Point One" series of amplifiers, so named because the total harmonic distortion was 0.1% at rated output. This represented a major leap forward in accepted standards for high-performance amplifiers (with 2% distortion generally considered acceptable at the time). This first "Point One" amplifier was known as the Type 15, and produced 15 watts output, at 0.1% distortion, using push-pull KT66 valves connected as triodes, with 26 dB feedback applied over four stages. The amplifier has a similar topology to the Williamson amplifier published in Wireless World in 1947.
In 1948, the original four-stage circuit was replaced with a three-stage design that was designated the TL/12. This amplifier had the same high performance at reduced cost, and it was responsible for establishing and securing the future of the company as a dominant player in the "hi-fi" boom of the 1950s and 60s.
Subsequent amplifiers from the company all used the same circuit topology as the TL/12, but took advantage of newer more efficient power valves and the so-called "ultra-linear" connection of the output stage to obtain higher power output with triode-like characteristics. These amplifiers included the TL/10, TL/25, TL/12-Plus, TL/25-Plus, TL/50-Plus, and the Stereo 20, Stereo 50 and Stereo 60.

Harmonic balance

Harmonic balance is a method used to calculate the steady-state response of non-linear differential equations, and is mostly applied to electrical circuits
. It is a "frequency domain" method for calculating the steady state, as opposed to the various "time-domain" steady state methods. The name "harmonic balance" is descriptive of the method, which starts with Kirchhoff's Current Law written in the frequency domain and a chosen number of harmonics. Effectively the method assumes the solution can be represented by a linear combination of sinusoids, then balances current and voltage sinusoids to satisfy Kirchhoff's law. The method is commonly used to simulate circuits which include nonlinear elements.
Microwave circuits were the original application for harmonic balance methods in electrical engineering. Microwave circuits were well-suited because, historically, microwave circuits consist of many linear components which can be directly represented in the frequency domain, plus a few nonlinear components. System sizes were typically small. For more general circuits, the method was considered impractical for all but these very small circuits until the mid-1990s, when Krylov subspace methods were applied to the problem. 
The application of preconditioned Krylov subspace methods allowed much larger systems to be solved, both in size of circuit and in numbers of harmonics. This made practical the present-day use of harmonic balance methods to analyze radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs).
Algorithm.
The algorithm starts with Kirchhoff's current law written in the frequency-domain. To increase the efficiency of the procedure, the circuit may be partitioned into its linear and nonlinear parts, since the linear part is readily described and calculated using nodal analysis directly in the frequency domain. 
First, an initial guess is made for the solution, then an iterative process continues:
Convergence is reached when formula_8 is acceptably small, at which point all voltages and currents of the steady-state solution are known, most often represented as Fourier coefficients.

Green ibis

The green ibis ("Mesembrinibis cayennensis") is a wading bird in the ibis family Threskiornithidae. It is the only member of the genus Mesembrinibis.
This is a resident breeder from Honduras through Nicaragua, Costa Rica and western Panama, and South America to northern Argentina. It undertakes some local seasonal movements in the dry season.
The green ibis occurs in wooded swamps and other wet forest habitats. Its nest consists of a platform of twigs placed in a tree. This species is less gregarious than its relatives and is usually seen alone or in pairs. It has been recorded as harassing sunbitterns nesting in the same tree.
Like other ibises, it eats fish, frogs and other water creatures, as well as insects. it is most active and vocal at dusk, with a loud rolling "co-co-co-co-corru-corru" call.
The green ibis is 48–56 cm long and weighs 650–750 g; the female is smaller than the male. Breeding adults have glossy greenish-black bodies, pale green legs and bill, and grey bare facial skin patches. Juveniles are much duller, but can be distinguished from the similar glossy ibis by their bulkier shape, shorter legs and broader wings. This species, like other ibises, flies with neck outstretched. Its flight is heavy, with fewer glides and jerkier wingbeats than its relatives.

Rimbey

Rimbey is a town in central Alberta, Canada. It is located at the junction of Highways 20 and 53 in the Blindman River valley area, approximately northwest of Red Deer and southwest of Edmonton.
History.
Officially made a community in 1902, the first name given to the settlement at the turn of the century was Kansas Ridge as many of the settlers came from Kansas. Among them were the three Rimbey brothers (Sam, Ben, and Jim) for whom the town was officially named after in 1904. The Rimbeys moved to Canada from Scott County, Illinois, having moved to Illinois in the 1830s from Maryland. They were originally from Pennsylvania.
In 1919 the Lacombe and Blindman Valley Electric Railway (later part of the Canadian Pacific Railway) reached Rimbey, and there was much enthusiasm for the "new town" by the tracks (now Highway 20). Two grain companies built elevators the following year and Rimbey's population swelled to 319 by 1921.
The Second World War brought abrupt changes to Rimbey, as young men and sometimes their families left the village. When war was over some returned and others did not. Many new faces came to Rimbey and the population surged to 634 by 1946.
Demographics.
In the 2011 Census, the Town of Rimbey had a population of 2,378 living in 983 of its 1,081 total dwellings, a 5.6% change from its 2006 population of 2,252. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.
The population of the Town of Rimbey according to its 2008 municipal census is 2,496.
In 2006, Rimbey had a population of 2,252 living in 987 dwellings, a 4.5% increase from 2001. The town has a land area of and a population density of .
Economy.
Rimbey is mainly a farming community, with the oil and gas sector increasing in importance.
The town has full amenities including hotels, motels, several grocery, convenience, and liquor stores and a campground. Rimbey has its own hospital and ambulance (although more specialized procedures are sent to Red Deer or Edmonton) and its own detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Attractions.
Pas-Ka-Poo Park includes large open lawns, a historical village site, museums and a wide array of interesting displays, including the World's Largest Collection of International Trucks in the Smithson International Truck Museum.
The Rimbey Golf & Trailer Park is located south.
The town has an outdoor swimming pool open from May to August every year, which is being rebuilt as a ² junior olympic pool with a beach entrance, two hot tubs, a double loop waterslide and a ² splash pad for toddlers up to 15 years of age.
The Beatty House is a historical house in the centre of town and can be booked for tours or to house social events.
There are also a couple of smaller public parks (designed for children) around town.
A multi-purpose motorsport facility, Central Alberta Raceways, is located east of Rimbey. It has been home to the annual Kinsmen Demolition Derby event since 2002 and its first oval race event was held in 2005. Its motocross track received a facelift in 2012, and its quarter-mile dragstrip is anticipated to open in 2012.
Education.
Operated by the Wolf Creek School Division No. 72, the Rimbey Elementary School, the Rimbey Junior-Senior High School, and the West Country Outreach School provide education within Rimbey. The town is also home to the Rimbey Christian School, a private school that offers learning for students in K-9. The Rimbey Nursery School offers play-based programs for children 3 to 5 years old.
Media.
The town newspaper is the "Rimbey Review". The Rimbey Review commenced publishing on January 27, 1997 and was owned by Sylvan Lake News. The paper was sold to Black Press in 2005. The Rimbey Review succeeded the Rimbey Record, which had been publishing since the early 1930s. The Rimbey Record was cited, in 1937, for its assistance in a series for the Edmonton Journal, which won that paper a Pulitzer prize. The Rimbey Record was, at its demise, part of a chain of newspapers, under the banner Record Publishing that failed financially after an unsuccessful attempt to go public.

However, it wasn't until she became Kure's official race queen in 1996 that Suzuki became a known name in the industry. In 1996, Suzuki released her first idol video titled "Black Velbet." In 1997, still modeling for Kure, Suzuki paired with Yoko Sugimura and was seen together in many race queen events, as well as several idol-oriented home video releases. Suzuki also appeared as an event girl for Minolta from 1998 to 2000.
As Suzuki's career gained speed, numerous photo books and idol videos were released, including "Deep F" (1998), "Six" (2001), "Natura" (2002) and "Will" (2003). Since 1998, Suzuki hasn't returned as a race queen, sticking to traditional modeling. Also, no idol videos or photo books have been released since 2003. After eleven years in the modeling business, Suzuki retired in summer 2005.

Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction

Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction are a British hard rock group.
Overview.
The band is the brainchild of Mark Manning, a former graphic artist and art editor of the now defunct "flexipop" magazine. The magazine folded back in 1982 but the hedonistic lifestyle of the frequenting rock and pop stars to the magazine' offices fueled his desire to experience the debauchery of life as a decadent rock star. He joined another music publication called "Metal Fury" as a graphic designer but would assume the alter ego "Zodiac Mindwarp" at night. Zodiac soon left Metal Fury and formed the Love Reaction in 1985 with Jimmy Cauty, who later formed The Orb, The JAMS (Justified Ancients of Mu Mu), and The KLF on guitar, Kid Chaos (real name Stephen Harris) on bass and Boom Boom Kaboomski on drums.
The band was signed to the FOOD ltd label of Phonogram Records who soon issued their first recording, the three track twelve incher Wild Child with just Zodiac (playing guitar and vocals), Kid Chaos on bass and Jake Le Mesurier on drums. A demo version of "High Priest of Love" was included on the Melody Maker "Vinyl Conflict 2" free EP in September 1986. By the end of the year the lineup had changed again to accommodate the still present figure of Cobalt Stargazer (real name Geoff Bird) and new drummer Slam Thunderhide (real name Stephen Landrum). That lineup would contribute the studio track, "Drug Shoes," to the FOOD "Imminent 2" various artists compilation.
At various times, the band has also featured Kid Chaos (real name Stephen Harris), Slam Thunderhide (real name Stephen Landrum), Evil Bastard (real name Robert Munro who co-penned and sang on three notable B-sides: Hangover from Hell, Holiday in Hell and Lager Woman from Hell), Thrash D Garbage (real name Paul Bailey), Flash Bastard (real name Jan Cyrka), Suzi X (real name Richard Levy), Tex Diablo (real name Christopher Renshaw), and Robbie Vom (real name Rob Morris).
Zodiac Mindwarp progressed rapidly from their first gig at the Dingwalls (Camden, London. Nov 1985) to playing in front of a packed Reading festival in 1987 but unfortunately was followed by the departure of Kid Chaos who joined the massive rock outfit The Cult. Zodiac regrouped by assigning Thrash D Garbage on Bass and Flash Bastard (Jan Cyrka) on rhythm guitar section. The expanded five member outfit all went on to record Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction's debut album in 1988 entitled Tattooed Beat Messiah.
Other band members playing bass include Suzi X, Tex Diablo and Kev Reverb.
Previous drummers were Robbie Vomm and The Apocalypse.
Current lineup
Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction play a sleazy style of commercial hard rock featuring big riffs and choruses, as was the trend in the band’s heyday of the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s. The camp lyrics are intended as self-parody, and can be seen as either humorous by those who "get the joke", or offensive by those who take them at face value, for their often lascivious and misogynist tone. Song titles like "Back Seat Education", "Feed My Frankenstein", "High Heeled Heaven", and "Trash Madonna" illustrate Mindwarp's tongue-in-cheek approach. Lyrical content also exhibits a send up of cult worship, often of Zodiac Mindwarp's self-proclaimed raging libido, with Mindwarp claiming the titles "sex fuhrer", "love dictator", and "high priest of love". Songs such as "Holy Gasoline", "President of the United States of Love", "Messianic Reprise", and "Elvis Died for You" are similarly inclined. Although often overlooked, Mindwarp has written songs such as "Hoodlum Thunder", from the album of the same name, that offer a scathing take on the then-current political actions of western powers, particularly commenting on war and imperialism.
The act produced a UK Singles Chart Top 20 hit with the breakthrough record "Prime Mover", a song that was inspired musically by Hawkwind's 1977 track "Quark, Strangeness and Charm", itself heavily inspired by the German group NEU!
They toured the US supporting Alice Cooper and Guns N' Roses on dozens of dates in 1988. After a few gigs, they were moved up to the middle of the bill between Cooper and Guns N' Roses. Stargazer, Thunderhide and Bastard were also featured in the film "" performing with Slash and Axl Rose (from Guns N' Roses) and Alice Cooper, in an encore from this tour featuring Cooper's hit "Under My Wheels". The Love Reaction's 1987 album "Tattooed Beat Messiah" failed to sell well enough in the States, resulting in them being dropped by their record label with outstanding debts, according to Zodiac himself. The "Tattooed Beat Messiah" LP spawned 5 videos that received regular rotation on MTV's "Headbangers Ball" and host Ricki Rachtman claimed the band as one of his all time favorites, and most underrated bands of the era.
Occasionally referred to as "biker rock", the band's style of hard rock is reflected in their outlandish attire, which tends to parody the post-apocalyptic Mad Max biker look. Mötley Crüe declared them to be their favorite band and immediately restyled themselves for the Girls, Girls, Girls record.
They adopted a more common "street look" recently, circa their comeback, around 1999.
In recent years, Manning has established himself as an author, penning "Bad Wisdom" (1996, with Bill Drummond), "Crucify Me Again" (2000), "Get Your Cock Out" (2000), "Fucked by Rock" (2001), "Collateral Damage", "The Wild Highway" (2005, again with Drummond). Manning is also a regular contributor to The Idler magazine.

Arno of Salzburg

Arno, Arn or Aquila (c. 750-821) was bishop of Salzburg, and afterwards its first archbishop. He preserved his voluminous correspondence from the scholar Alcuin of York.
Early years.
He entered the church at an early age, and after passing some time at Weihenstephan Abbey, Freising, became abbot of Elnon, or Saint-Amand Abbey as it was afterwards called, where he made the acquaintance of Alcuin.
Carolingian Empire.
In 785 he was made bishop of Salzburg and in 787 was employed by Tassilo III, duke of the Bavarians, as an envoy to Charlemagne at Rome. He appears to have attracted the notice of the Frankish king, through whose influence in 798 Salzburg was made the seat of an archbishopric; and Arno, as the first holder of this office, became metropolitan of Bavaria and received the "pallium" from Pope Leo III.
The area of his authority was extended to the east by the conquests of Charlemagne over the Avars for the Carolingian Empire, and he began to take a prominent part in the government of Bavaria. He acted as one of the "missi dominici", and spent some time at the court of Charlemagne, where he was known by the assembled scholars as Aquila, the "Eagle". His name appears as one of the signatories to the emperor's will. He established a library at Salzburg, furthered in other ways the interests of learning, and presided over several synods called to improve the condition of the church in Bavaria.
Later years and books.
Soon after the death of Charlemagne in 814, Arno appears to have withdrawn from active Iife, although he retained his archbishopric until his death on 24 January 821. Aided by a deacon named Benedict, Arno drew up about 788 a catalogue of lands and proprietary rights belonging to the church in Bavaria, under the title of "Indiculus" or "Congestum Arnonis".
Many other works were produced under the protection of Arno, among them a Salzburg consuetudinary, an edition of which appears in "Quellen and Erörterungen zur bayerischen und deutschen Geschichte", vol. vii, edited by L. Rockinger (Munich, 1856). It has been suggested by Wilhelm von Giesebrecht that Arno was the author of an early section of the " Laurissenses majores," surviving in the copy at Lorsch Abbey, which deals with the history of the Frankish kings from 741 to 829; and of which an edition appears in the "Monumenta Germaniae Historica," Scriptores, Band i, pp. 128–131, edited by G. H. Pertz (Hanover, 1826). If this supposition be correct, Arno was the first extant writer to apply the name "Deutsch" ("theodisca") to the German language.

Cockburn, South Australia

Cockburn is a town on the border of South Australia and New South Wales near Broken Hill. The town population consists of roughly 25 people with a greater regional community of 180 as of 2005.
Town history.
Huge ore deposits were discovered in Silverton, which prompted the South Australian Government in 1884 to offer to the New South Wales (NSW) Government the building of a narrow gauge railway line from the NSW-SA border to Silverton. This was seen to be necessary since horse-drawn transport could not cope with the transport of the ore through South Australia. This offer was rejected by the NSW Government.
Local business people therefore formed the Silverton Tramway in 1885 to build the railway line from Silverton to the SA border. The town of Cockburn came into existence in 1886 (on the SA Side of the border) as a place where trains would exchange locomotives and crews. On the NSW side of the border the Silverton Tramway Company built a station and siding called Burns.
The pressure for the expansion of Cockburn was increased with mineral discoveries at Thackaringa and Umberumberka from 1883 onwards. The silver-lead-zinc discovery at Broken Hill led to the railway line being extended from Silverton to Broken Hill in 1887. The route was extremely important as it provided balanced trading for locomotives with a momentum grade 'up' from Broken Hill to Cockburn and a rising grade 'down' from Cockburn to Broken Hill. This was the main advantage of the route to and from Cockburn.
By 1892 the town of Cockburn had become sizable. The population was 2,000 people. Cockburn boasted two hotels, two general stores, three boarding houses, schools and churches. It contained within its business sector a blacksmith, butcher, baker, produce merchant and carrier. Stationed at Cockburn included two engineers, a stationmaster, customs officer, locomotive superintendent and a miner. Locomotive shed and related work facilities were recorded as existing in 1892. Seven trains regularly ran between Petersburg (now Peterborough), Cockburn and Broken Hill. These included passenger trains. In 1892, 83,194 passengers travelled through Cockburn.
Cockburn also has a role in industrial relations history in Broken Hill. Tom Mann, a political "disruptionist" was barred from speaking publicly in New South Wales. In 1908 3,000 passengers came from Broken Hill to Cockburn to hear Tom Mann speak. From the front of the hall next to the Cockburn Hotel he addressed the crowd, which was the beginning of a dispute known as the 1909 Lockout. During this dispute Broken Hill mining unionists were locked out of the company gates for rejecting pay cuts which would have been below the minimum wage.
The standard gauge railway line, officially opened in 1970, runs south of the surveyed town limits of Cockburn, and has a new station and a passing loop. The "new" station is now disused.
In the early 1990s the South Australian Government proposed to close down the small communities along the Barrier Highway leading to a strong and unified resistance from the local communities. In April 2006, the government planned to demolish five former railway houses [http://www.abc.net.au/news/australia/sa/port/200605/s1637006.htm].

<doc id="2896519" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2896519" title="Basal body temperature">
Basal body temperature

Basal body temperature is the lowest body temperature attained by during rest (usually during sleep). It is generally measured immediately after awakening and before any physical activity has been undertaken, although the temperature measured at that time is somewhat higher than the true basal body temperature (see Fig. 1). In women, ovulation causes an increase of one-half to one degree Fahrenheit (one-quarter to one-half degree Celsius) in basal body temperature (BBT); monitoring of BBTs is one way of estimating the day of ovulation. The tendency of a woman to have lower temperatures before ovulation, and higher temperatures afterwards, is known as a biphasic pattern. Charting of this pattern may be used as a component of fertility awareness.
BBT as a Birth Control Method.
Hormonal causes of biphasic patterns.
The higher levels of estrogen present during the pre-ovulatory (follicular) phase of the menstrual cycle lower BBTs. The higher levels of progesterone released by the corpus luteum after ovulation raise BBTs. The rise in temperatures can most commonly be seen the day after ovulation, but this varies and BBTs can only be used to estimate ovulation within a three day range.
If pregnancy does not occur, the disintegration of the corpus luteum causes a drop in BBTs that roughly coincides with the onset of the next menstruation. If pregnancy does occur, the corpus luteum continues to function (and maintain high BBTs) for the first trimester of the pregnancy. After the first trimester, the woman's body temperature drops to her pre-ovulatory normal as the placenta takes over functions previously performed by the corpus luteum.
Very rarely, the corpus luteum may form a cyst. A corpus luteum cyst will cause BBTs to stay elevated and prevent menstruation from occurring until it resolves, which could take weeks or months.
While trying to conceive.
Regular menstrual cycles are often taken as evidence that a woman is ovulating normally, and irregular cycles is evidence she is not. However, many women with irregular cycles do ovulate normally, and some with regular cycles are actually anovulatory or have a luteal phase defect. Records of basal body temperature can be used to accurately determine if a woman is ovulating, and if the length of the post-ovulatory (luteal) phase of her menstrual cycle is sufficient to sustain a pregnancy. Some fertility computers and software can help a woman to determine these factors.
Pregnancy tests are not accurate until 2–3 weeks after ovulation. Knowing an estimated date of ovulation can prevent a woman from getting false negative results due to testing too early. Also, 18 consecutive days of elevated temperatures means a woman is almost certainly pregnant.
Tracking basal body temperatures is a more accurate method of estimating gestational age than tracking menstrual periods.
While avoiding pregnancy.
Charting of basal body temperatures is used in some methods of fertility awareness, and may be used to determine the onset of post-ovulatory infertility. However, BBTs only show when ovulation has occurred; they do not predict ovulation. Normal sperm life is up to seven to ten days, making prediction of ovulation several days in advance necessary for avoiding pregnancy.

Co-Freemasonry

Co-Freemasonry is a form of Freemasonry which admits both men and women. It began in France in the 1890s with the forming of "Le Droit Humain", and is now an international movement represented by several Co-Masonic administrations throughout the world. Most male-only Masonic Lodges do not recognise Co-Freemasonry, holding it to be "irregular", or "clandestine"
Organisations.
"Le Droit Humain".
The International Order of Mixed Freemasonry "Le Droit Humain" was founded in France in the late nineteenth century, during a period of strong feminist and women's suffrage campaigning. It was the first Co-Masonic Order, and also the first truly international Masonic Order. Today it has members from over 60 countries worldwide.
French Masonry had long attempted to include women, the Grand Orient de France having allowed Rites of Adoption as early as 1774, by which Lodges could "adopt" sisters, wives and daughters of Freemasons, imparting to them the mysteries of several degrees.
In 1879, following differences among members of the "Supreme Council of France", twelve lodges withdrew from it and founded the "Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise" (GLSE). One of these Lodges, "Les Libres Penseurs" (The Free Thinkers) in Le Pecq, reserved in its charter the right to initiate women as Freemasons, proclaiming the essential equality of man and woman.
On January 14, 1882, Maria Deraismes, a well-known humanitarian, feminist author and lecturer, was initiated into "Les Libres Penseurs", after of the lodge withdrew from its Grand Lodge . The Worshipful Master, Bro. Houbron, justified this act as having the highest interests of humanity at heart, and as being a perfectly logical application of the principle of "A Free Mason in a Free Lodge".
In 1890 the Lodge "La Jérusalem Écossaise", also of the "Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise", petitioned other Lodges for the establishment of a new order of Freemasonry that would accept both men and women. This time "La Jérusalem" Lodge did not propose to initiate women itself, but to create a new order working in parallel. The main proponent of this was Dr. Georges Martin, a French senator, advocate of equal rights for women, and also a member of "Les Libres Penseurs".
On March 14, 1893, Deraismes, Martin and several other male Freemasons founded "La Respectable Loge, Le Droit Humain, Maçonnerie Mixte" (Worshipful Lodge, Human Rights, Co-Masonry) in Paris. They initiated, passed and raised sixteen prominent French women.
Shortly after, on April 4 of the same year, the first Grand Lodge of Co-Freemasonry was established, the "Grande Loge Symbolique Écossaise Mixte de France" (Grand Lodge of Mixed Scottish Rite Freemasonry of France), which would later become known as the International Order of Co-Freemasonry "Le Droit Humain". This was a radical departure from most other forms of Freemasonry, for not only did the new order not require belief in a Supreme Being (the "Grand Orient de France" had discarded this requirement in 1877)—it opened its doors to all of humanity who were "... just, upright and free, of mature age, sound judgment and strict morals."
As early as 1895 the Lodge "Le Droit Humain" (with no number) was travelling around—to Vernon, Blois, Rouen and Havre, in what were called "selections"—it gave conference and started to hold initiations in the presence,every time, of a large audience Lodge Nr.1 was thus created in Blois in 1895, but, permanently excluded in 1902, this lodge re-awoke only recently. Its Mother Lodge "Le Droit Humain" now took over the position of Lodge Nr.1 whilst splitting up again in Paris to form Lodge Nr.4. Three lodges were founded in the provinces:
Lodge Nr.1 in Lyon (1896) It contained an article by Georges Martin enunciating the principles of LE DROIT HUMAIN as well as various rules regarding to membership lists, subscription fees (11 francs for an initiation, and 20–31 francs for an increase of wages), the price of diplomas (5 francs), the annual subscription rate (18 francs) and the price of subscription to the Newssheet (2 francs per year).
As a base for comparison: 1871 the average wage of a worker was 4.98 frcs. A woman earned half of this sum. In 1882 a clerk at a Ministry earned 1500–2000 frcs per year. One week's stay in Paris in 1900 for the International Exhibition cost about 100 frcs. The co-masonic News-Sheets appeared regularly until 1914—their publication was interrupted during the war, but some editions were published in French in America.
The Eastern Federation.
Several prominent members of the Theosophical Society joined Co-Freemasonry, including Annie Besant, George Arundale, Charles W. Leadbeater, C. Jinarajadasa and Henry Steel Olcott. Henceforth, wherever they took Theosophy, they also introduced Co-Freemasonry.
The "Order of Universal Co-Freemasonry in Great Britain and the British Dependencies" was founded by Annie Besant and officers of the Supreme Council of the French "Maçonnerie Mixte" (known today as "The International Order of Freemasonry for Men and Women, Le Droit Humain") on September 26, 1902, with the consecration of "Lodge Human Duty" No. 6 in London. Besant remained head of the Order until her death in 1933. The English working, influenced by the Theosophy of its leading members, restored certain Masonic practices not required in the French working, notably that its members hold a belief in God or a Supreme Being. The permission received from France to reinstate this in the English workings is known as the "Annie Besant Concord", and in 1904 a new English ritual was printed, which firmly established this requirement as central to the work. The revised ritual was called the "Dharma Ritual", also known as the "Besant-Leadbeater" and more recently as the "Lauderdale" working. The Dharma Ritual also attempted to restore prominence to esoteric and mystical aspects that its Theosophically-minded authors felt were the heart of Freemasonry, so that it became foremostly a spiritual organisation; Co-Freemasonry of this Order was therefore sometimes called "Occult Freemasonry". Leadbeater served of the presiding officer of the Sydney Lodge #404 and various lodges and chapters of the York and Scottish Rites.
The Honorable Order of American Co-Masonry.
In 1903 the first Co-Masonic Lodge in the USA was instituted under "Le Droit Humain" by the French professor Antoine Muzzarelli in New York. He founded the first "Alpha Lodge" in Charleroi, Pennsylvania an additional 49 others before his untimely death 1908. In November of that year, delegates of twenty-four of these Lodges founded the "American Federation of Human Rights" in St. Louis. By 1924, nearly 100 Lodges had been started under the guidance of Louis Goaziou, President, Most Puissant Grand Commander and Representative of the Supreme Council in Paris.
Defection of Lodges from "Le Droit Humain".
Between the mid-1990s and early 2000s a large number of lodges defected from "Le Droit Humain", which they charged with infringing upon their constitutional rights. On 2 January 2001 "Le Droit Humain" formally expelled four senior members of the British Federation over these disagreements. Following these expulsions, about 70 members resigned.
Upon the decision by Le Droit Humain to remove recognition of its American Federation and set up a new body, chartered in Delaware, the existing body established itself as independent and today is called "The Honorable Order of American Co-Masonry, the American Federation of Human Rights. The headquarters of this body continues, as it has for almost a century, in Larkspur, CO. For more details, see below.
Other disaffected Lodges around the world formed the Grand Lodge of Freemasonry for Men and Women, the Eastern Order of International Co-Freemasonry, and a number of smaller orders. The Grand Lodge of Freemasonry for Men and Women does not use the term "Co-Masonry", and members call themselves "Freemasons" instead (it should be noted all Co-Masons are Freemasons).
The defection of the British Lodges was the latest in the past two decades. In 2001 the Grand Lodge of Freemasonry for Men and Women was formed by expelled and suspended members of the Consistory Council of the "Le Droit Humain" British Federation for refusing to drop the requirement for a belief in a Supreme Being. The Eastern Order of International Co-Freemasonry formed later, as did a few other smaller orders.
Other lodges, including those in Australia and South Africa and some United States lodges, opted to remain affiliated with the Supreme Council of the International Order of Mixed Freemasonry "Le Droit Humain", and continue to exist as the British, Australian, and American Federations of the order, governed by the Representative of the Supreme Council in France, known as the Most Puissant Grand Commander, who holds the 33rd and highest degree of the Order. However many more Lodges have now broken away and have aligned themselves with the new Orders maintaining also the landmark belief in a supreme being.
Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies.
The first co-masonic Dutch lodge was solemnly installed in Amsterdam on Saturday, 10 June 1905, by the "Grand Mistress" Marie-Georges Martin and the Grand Orator Georges Martin, with distinctive name Cazotte Nr. 13.
Various lodges were subsequently founded in The Hague (Nr.41 in 1911), in Hilversum (Nr.43 in 1913), in Rotterdam (Nr.92 in 1915), in Arnhem (nr.74 in 1916) and again in Amsterdam (Nr. 53).
Co-Freemasonry was also introduced to the Dutch East Indies when W.B. Fricke founded on the island of Java, Lodge "Lux Orientis" Nr.406 followed in Surabaya in 1913, Lodge Nr. 421 in Semarang and Lodge Nr.422 in Bandung in 1915. (Lodges Nrs. 402 and 422 still active). One lodge was even installed on the island of Sumatra in Medan.
The Supreme Council designated its Representative for the Dutch lodges and for those in the Dutch colonies who formed one complete Jurisdiction. (It was not until 1919 that the lodges in the Dutch East Indies became independent of the Dutch Jurisdiction). Van Ginkei was designated as representative of the Supreme Council for the Dutch Jurisdiction.
Belgium.
The first lodge of "Le Droit Humain" was founded in Brussels in 1911, after a long period of incubation during which eminent members of the "Maçonnerie Mixte Ecossaise de France" worked patiently to convince the Progressives to accept a masonry working in a world without frontiers.
At the Congress on Free Thought of 1895, Louise Barberousse, Senior Deacon of the Lodge Nr.1 "Le Droit Humain" introduced co-masonry to Brussels and showed its Bulletin.
Switzerland.
After the permanent exclusion of the Zürich Lodge in 1905, founding of a new lodge was concentrated in Geneva which became the centre of many world-wide organisations.
Having worked as a Triangle for three years, Lodge Nr.44 in the Order of Geneva was solemnly installed by Georges Martin on 6 April 1913 in the presence of about twenty Brethren from the Grand Lodge of Switzerland "Alpina" and the ceremony was followed with the initiation of a candidate.
The first worshipful master was brother Reelfs—a remarkable personality—who was born in Amsterdam in 1888, and who had lived in Switzerland since 1906, after completed his studies in The Hague; multi-lingual, speaking Dutch, English, German, Greek and French, he became Professor of Literature at Madame Rollier's school (she would later on be a pioneer of "Le Droit Humain" in Switzerland, and became worshipful master of the lodge in Lausanne).
Having been a member of Lodge Nr.13 "Cazotte" in Amsterdam, Bro Reelfs was, at that time of the consecration of Lodge Nr.44, a member of both Grand Lodge of Switzerland "Alpina" and of the "Grant Orient de France", and was invested with the 18th Degree. He could not prevent the closure of the lodge during the war because members of foreign nationalities were obliged to return home where some were called up for military service. As to Reelfs ha was to prove his worth after the war.
Australia.
The Australian Federation consists of nine Craft Lodges meeting in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In addition to craft Freemasonry many degrees of the York Rite and the A.:.A.:.S.:.R.:. are worked in Australia. One group in Sydney has begun to use the continental or Georges Martin Ritual which does not make reference to the Great Architect. The Sydney Lodge #404 was once headed by Charles Leadbeater who co-authored the ritual used by many Co-Masonic Lodges today.
United States.
The origins and development of "Le Droit Humain" in the USA cannot be separated from the life and activity of one of its primary founders, the Frenchman Louis Goaziou.
Born in Brittany, France in 1864, he emigrated to the USA in 1881 where he worked in the coal mines of Houtsdale, Pennsylvania. Three years later he married Marie Bourgeois, born in Namur in 1866. Goaziou wanted to improve the appalling working conditions of miners and set up, in 1866, the Association of United Miners, as well as two Associations for mutual help, whose aims he defended in a weekly French speaking magazine. Through this he attracted the attention of a professor of French at Columbia University in New York, Antoine Muzarelli, founding member of the New York Lodge "La'Atlantide" laboring under the "Grand Orient de France". It was Muzzarelli who contacted Le Droit Humain's then Grand Master and Co-Founder George Martin, offering to found Lodges in North American for Le Droit Humain. In this way, Muzzarelli became the founder of Co-Freemasonry in North America.
The humanitarian ideal of the new Masonic order struck him as absolutely compatible with the Socialist ideas of Louis Goaziou. Muzzarelli contacted Goaziou in 1903 with the idea of creating in Charleroi (Pennsylvania) either a Lodge under the "Grand Orient". He did not inform Goaziou of the option to form the Lodge of under Le Droit Humain, into which their wives also could be admitted, until he arrived in Charleroi in October 1903 to institute the Lodge. The charter members decided they would found the Lodge under Le Droit Humain. The first three degrees were conferred on them by Antoine Muzarelli, and over two days, October 18 and 19, 1903, the first Co-masonic American lodge, Alpha No 301 was born in Charleroi, Pennsylvania. Louis Goaziou became the first Worshipful Master.
This French speaking Lodge continued until 1973. Six other Lodges were founded in 1904, three working in French, one in Slav, one in Italian and one in English (under the direction of John Goaziou, a brother of Louis). Soon Lodges were founded in Chicago, St. Louis and in California. The Rose-Croix degrees were given to Louis Goaziou by communication in November, 1904 (please note, Goaziou's Grand Lodge Eternal record in Larkspur, CO, indicates he received this degree from Muzzarelli September 1, 1905) and he become a member of Chapter Nr.1 in the valley of Paris. The first American Chapter (Nr.?) was formed in Charleroi with six charter members.
It was Muzzarelli who conferred upon Goaziou the Degrees of the Scottish Rite up to the 30th. Muzzarelli named Goaziou his deputy in early 1907. Unfortunately, the two men fell out over mutual charges of financial irregularity combined with personal dislike. The Order also was in disarray because too many Lodges had been founded too quickly. The new Order also experienced external pressures, including persecution by the existing Male-Only Orders in the US. In the fall of 1908, Muzzarelli was pressured to call what remained of the Lodges he founded, just less than half, to a convention in St. Louis, Missouri. Tragically, Muzzarelli, who in addition to pressures in the Order also had many personal problems, committed suicide October 15, 1908. Though Goaziou made it plain he would prefer the presidency go to another Co-Mason, it was Goaziou who took charge of the financial and administrative affairs of the lodges, and who was elected President at the convention in St. Louis.
The American Federation of Human Rights had received charter from the US Government in 1907 but it was at the 1908 convention that the American Federation was officially constituted. The 31st, 32nd and the 33rd degrees of the Scottish Rite were conferred on him on 21 November 1909, and he was designated by the Supreme Council as its Representative for the American Federation.
The same year Annie Besant was staying in the USA where she installed an English speaking lodge in Chicago and granted the degree of "Installed Master" to certain members- a degree which did not exist either in the "Grand Orient" or the Scottish Rite (a version of this degree exists in Muzzarelli's journal, apparently around 1905, so it's not universally agreed that Besant introduced this degree into the AFHR). A new trend began in American Co-masonry. Whilst some members of French and Italian origin, mainly recruited in the mining industry, had concentrated on social problems, other Masons entered the AFHR to try to bring the Order under Theosophic influence, seeing in the "Ancient Mysteries" the origins of masonry. So long as Goaziou was alive and Grand Commander of the Order, the AFHR followed a middle path between these two extremes
When the 1914-1918 war ended, operative work started by Louis Goaziou recommenced. Headquarters in Larkspur Colorado was established in 1916. Within a few years, the mortgage of the property was paid off. The administrative building in Larkspur was built between 1921–1924 in order to replace the first building, which had become too small. In 1922 the potash mines in Colorado went bankrupt and this led to about 100 Italian members of "Le Droit Humain" losing their jobs. Despite their real interest for the building of Larkspur, many of these miners felt they had no option but to leave Mansonry. In addition to these departures, an economic downturn have taken hold in North American. It was no longer possible, through lack of funds, to realize the initial project to construct, next door to the administrative offices at Larkspur, an orphanage and a home for the elderly. However Louis Goaziou's hard effort to achieve these goals were not successful. With the coming of the Great Depression, membership went into steep decline, which did not recover until after World War II, in the time of his successor, Edith Armour.
In December 1993, when demands from the Supreme Council in Paris conflicted with the International Constitution and the National Constitution of the American Federation of "Le Droit Humain", which mandated independence in internal affairs and adherence to United States law, a large part of the membership decided to withdraw from "Le Droit Humain".
In this midst of this schism, Le Droit Humain withdrew its recognition of the American Federation of Human Rights and set up a new American Federation, chartered in Delaware. On April 11, 1994, the Supreme Council of American Co-Masonry, reformed under members of the Grand Inspector General of the Thirty-third Degree. Also known as "American Co-Masonry", this now-independent obedience, which has its headquarters in Larkspur, Colorado, has since become the largest Co-Masonic organization in the United States.
The Eastern Order of International Co-Freemasonry.
In 2001, following growing concerns over erosions to the Annie Besant Concord by the administration in Paris, many member lodges of the Eastern Federation resigned from Le Droit Humain, severing all ties, and reconstituted new governing bodies. Lodges in India, New Zealand, parts of the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico and Spain reformed as the Eastern Order of International Co-Freemasonry; lodges in the UK reformed as the Grand Lodge of Freemasonry for Men and Women.
The Co-Freemasonic Order of the Blazing Star.
The Co-Freemasonic Order of the Blazing Star is an independent order of freemasonry based in the South West of England that admits men and women equally. It sees its main emphasis as cultivating the spiritual and esoteric aspects of freemasonry, and offers a true initiatory system of training and development of the 33 degrees of "The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite" for the benefit of humanity and the world. It currently operates an ancient Irish working in the craft degrees.
In November 1997 a group of senior masons formed an independent Supreme Council to revitalise and regenerate masonic ritual and practice with an explicit emphasis on the symbolic, esoteric and spiritual teachings, initiatory training, and the "inner" workings forming the basis of the ritual work. To distinguish the new order from other masonic bodies, the name "Order of the Blazing Star" was taken. The Blazing Star is a universal symbol, and is found in most masonic rituals. The principals, rituals and traditions are still based on those of the Grand Scottish Constitutions of 1786, revised and agreed by the national Supreme Councils of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite at Lausanne in 1876. In May 2007 the Supreme Council decided the name of the order should more closely reflect its heritage and work and thus "The Co-Freemasonic Order of the Blazing Star" was established.
Recognition of Co-Freemasonry.
Co-Freemasonry is not formally recognised by any of the larger male-only Masonic Grand Lodges in the US in as much as intervisitation or other Masonic interaction is not permitted.
A Landmark of Freemasonry agreed by the 51 masculine Grand Lodges in the US is that the initiation of women is forbidden and members take a binding obligation not to countenance the initiation of women. There are many other masculine Grand Lodges outside the US that maintain both as a "Landmark", including the United Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, the Grand Lodge of Ireland, the Grand East of the Netherlands and the Grand Lodge of South Africa who all consider each other to be "Regular" (abiding by the same rules) and so allow their members to visit freely between these constitutions.
Certain Grand Lodges of Co-Freemasonry, those under Le Droit Humain, also follow the lead of the Grand Orient de France in removing references to the Supreme Being from their rituals and initiating atheists; this is a further point of separation from typical Masonic Lodges which hold belief in a Supreme Being to be a Landmark requirement.
Notwithstanding the prohibition of interaction in a ritual context, the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), the oldest of the Grand Lodges, whilst not recognising Co-Freemasonry, states that it does hold informal discussions from time to time with Women's and Co-Masonic Grand Lodges on issues of mutual concern, and that
Brethren are therefore free to explain to non-Masons, if asked, that Freemasonry is not confined to men (even though this Grand Lodge does not itself admit women).
The Grand Orient de France did not initiate women for many years, but it does now and it recognizes Masonic bodies that do. Thus, it allows visitation by women from those bodies.

Sentosa Luge

Sentosa Luge is a luge located in Sentosa, Singapore. It opened in the second half of 2005. The luge is situated on the Imbiah Lookout cluster opposite the Tiger Sky Tower, and has a length of 650 metres. The luge is a self-driving car system in which riders control the speed by pushing a pair of handlebars back and forth. The luge ride goes downhill, relying on gravitational pull to move. After the ride, the Skyride using chairlifts brings riders, luge carts, and the helmets back to the starting point. The Skyride is similar to a ski lift.
Incidents.
On 19 May 2008, two children, aged nine and six, fell as they were getting off the moving chairlift and were trapped in the small space between the chairlift and concrete ground. The chairlift dragged them for half a metre before they were pulled out by a friend. The children suffered cuts and bruises.
Tracks.
Currently There are two tracks,the old one called the forest trail and the new one the dragon trail.The nd 688M respectively

Plançon a picot

The plançon à picot, or simply plançon (also spelled planson), was a medieval infantry weapon designed for smashing and thrusting. It consisted of a stout iron-shod baseball-bat-like shaft (length 1-1.5 m) with a steel spike attached on top. It was cheap and easy to make plus it was extremely efficient against heavily armoured opponents. The weapon was a relative of the goedendag, a popular weapon of Flemish militias of the 14th century. Given that the plançon à picot was recorded at several times as being carried alongside the goedendag, they may not be identical.

Uganda National Congress

Uganda National Congress (UNC), Uganda's first political party, was formed in 1952 by Ignatius Musazi, and its first Secretary General was Abu Mayanja. It replaced the Uganda African Farmers Union after it was banned by the British colonial administration.
Following the ban of Uganda African Farmers Union in 1949, Musazi next organized the Federation of Partnerships of Uganda African Farmers (F.P.U.A.F.) in 1950. (Apter, D.E. 1961: 310-313) The "partners" registered at the Registry of Companies and Business Names were twenty men described as farmers. These included I.K. Musazi, Peter Sonko, George Lwanga, Erieza Bwete and others who had been prominent in the 1949 riots, Bataka Party or UAFU.
The Federation had links with Fenner Brockaway, the British Labor Party liberal M.P. and enjoyed the warm support of the Congress of the Peoples against Imperialism. Unlike its predecessor, the UAFU, which was virtually limited to Buganda, the Federation was spread in most parts of eastern and northern Uganda. The Federation received immense technical assistance from foreign co-operators, and volunteers suggested by Brockaway were active in Uganda working for F.P.U.A.F. (Apter, D.E. 1961: 311) among such volunteers was an American, Dr. George Shepherd who Musazi had met in London.
Dr. Shepherd was an idealist whose strong sympathy with the poor and oppressed had been shaped when, as a young boy, he lived with his missionary parents in China. (Stonehouse, J. 1960: 48) The arrival of Dr. Shepherd in Uganda in 1951 injected into the Federation very crucial elements in its management and eventual transformation into a political organization, the Uganda National Congress, the following year.
Not only did he bring in badly needed management skills, he brought in political insight as well. There is evidence that he was a key catalyst in getting Musazi launch the Uganda National Congress (UNC). Dr. Shepherd himself was to write: "I soon decided that it was important, both for the welfare of the people of Uganda and the co-operative movement that a political party be launched. This would take the pressure off the Federation of Farmers to be a political unit itself. And it would bring into the field an organization that would openly deal in the political issues, which after all were the decisive ones."(Shepherd, G.W. 1955: 94)
The other source of the germ of the formation of UNC was a group of radical political activists who discussed the idea of the formation of an anti-colonial movement with Musazi in London. One of these radicals, Fenner Brockway was to write: "It is quite possible of course that Musazi thought of establishing Congress after the riots of 1949, but I don't think it took a very concrete form in his mind before the discussion which we had in London. I would not claim to be the author of the idea but certainly it was discussed by George Padmore, Dr. Leon Szur and myself. We urged Musazi strongly to establish a movement of this character and Dr. Szur particularly was responsible for insisting that it should be of an inter-racial nature. For this reason it was called the Uganda National Congress rather than Uganda African Congress. In practice, I don't think Indians or Europeans have joined but Musazi agreed that membership should not be limited to Africans in the hope of bringing in sympathizers of other races."(Ascherson, N. 1956:8)
In the absence of sizable participation of the Asians and Europeans, the anti-colonial movement led by Musazi consisted of essentially two tendencies: the ambivalent nationalism typified and led by Musazi, and the true (Kohn, H. 1964: 64) nationalism yet unorganized and leaderless.
In his endeavors to constitute a political organization, due to his ambivalence, Musazi first approached a respected Muganda chief whom he thought had the appropriate stature and qualities to lead the movement. (Shepherd, G.W. 1955: 168-170) When this chief refused, and not discouraged from his search for an appropriate Muganda of stature to provide leadership, Musazi next approached Kabaka Mutesa (sic) himself, who also turned him down.
Reluctance to participate in a nation-wide anti-colonial movement did not limit itself to the leadership of Buganda -- it pervaded the Ganda masses as a whole. Not only did the Baganda believe their interests were being catered for within the 1900 Agreement, but given the feudal character of their society, all political leadership, thought and organization was taken to repose in the Kabaka.
There was no way a true national movement would make headway in the Buganda of those days. George Shepherd did observe: "The Uganda National Congress might have died at birth if it had not been for the interest which was shown in it by several leaders from tribes other than Buganda."(Shepherd, G.W. 1955: 169-170) And so it was from leading chiefs and elders of Lango, Teso and Toro that Musazi found enthusiastic support for the formation of an anti-colonial movement, the UNC, launched on March 2, 1952.
The following year Buganda got engulfed in a major crisis. The Kabaka was deported to Britain. Following that deportation, much as the Baganda had never really liked UNC, UNC became the only organ through which the Baganda could agitate for the return of the Kabaka. As a result Baganda joined UNC in droves.
Emergence of Obote
It was in the throes of these fleeting developments toward independence that Apollo Milton Obote emerged. Obote had returned to Uganda in 1956 from Kenya where he had gone to work. (Gertzel, C. 1974: 47-51) While in Kenya he had got deeply involved in the anti-colonial struggles over there: he had been a very active member of the Kenya African Union before it was prescribed, and later was one of the leading members of Nairobi African Congress Party.
At the time of his return, Lango, his home district, was represented in the Legico (Legislative Council) by Yakobo Omonya, a man of limited political skills. With Obote, one of the first people from the district to reach Makerere University, a man who had been forged into a consummate politician in the struggles in Kenya in the theatre, it was not long before Omonya was prevailed upon to make room.
Subsequently, in December 1957, Milton Obote was elected to represent Lango District in the Legico. He took his seat in March 1958. Apart from using the Chambers of the Council to relentlessly and courageously wage struggles against colonialism, he also joined other national-democrats in the "opposition to Protectorate government proposals which accorded Buganda differential political treatment from the rest of the country." Within a short time in the Legico, he had established himself as the most articulate anti-colonial spokesman and was generally recognized as the leader of the unofficial members of the Council.
In the UNC, too, the party under whose umbrella he had been elected to the Legico, Obote's political fortunes were fast rising. When in December 1958, the UNC split and a section of it formed the Uganda Peoples' Union (UPU), Obote who remained in the UNC rapidly acquired a commanding position in the dominant wing of the party. This position was to prove a major asset in the ideological crisis that UNC was later to undergo.
Crisis in UNC
The crisis arose out of a need for the UNC to transform itself from a 'primary' or 'secondary' resistance movement (Ranger, T.O. 1968: ; Stokes, E. 1970: 100-106) which both the Bataka Party and Uganda Farmers Union respectively had been, into a modern anti-colonial movement which would not only be anti-imperialist but would also champion the aspirations of minorities. At one time this need had caused a number of the younger members of the UNC to break-off and form the abortive United Congress Party. (Apter, D.E. 1961: 333)
The issue which came to be symptomatic of the crisis was the UNC office in Cairo. John Kale or Kalekezi (or Kalisa), after his expulsion from Makerere University, had gone to Cairo and opened an office for UNC. This office did propaganda work with Radio Cairo, and acted as a link between the anti-colonial movement in Uganda and the democratic forces in the anti-imperialist world. (Apter, D.E. 1961: 333)
The merits of this office were disputed, and the UNC was to seriously split over this disagreement. A section of the membership of UNC led by Musazi felt that the Cairo office was not only a means of trading "the imperialism of one country for that of another, especially a country (meaning Egypt) that had for 2500 years controlled the whole Nile Valley, but also communism."(Apter, D.E. 1961: 334 footnote 59)
The other section of UNC, consisting of elements younger than Musazi, but with greater exposure to the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist struggles elsewhere, not only believed in maintaining contacts with the anti-imperialists world, but desired a more radical nationalist movement of the mobilizing type, striking firmly for a united Uganda while attacking the parochialism of the Lukiiko and Baganda.
The contention between these two political lines came to a head on January 12, 1959. The previous month three senior members of the UNC (Abu Mayanja, Jolly Joe Kiwanuka, and Dr. Kanunka) had attended the Pan-African Congress in Accra, Ghana. They had participated in passing resolutions which among other things, recommended that "those African traditional institutions whether political, social or economic which clearly have shown their reactionary character and the sordid support of colonialism be condemned."(Apter, D.E. 1961:334)
Returning from Accra via Cairo, where they called at the controversial office, Kiwanuka defended the Cairo office and identified the real issue at stake: "Uganda cannot remain an island in a sea of Pan-African and universal nationalism. Our establishment of a national office in Cairo has marked a great era in our struggle. It has broken the chains of isolation, and focused world attention on the seriousness of the Uganda people in our unshakable upsurge for freedom." (Apter, D.E. 1961: 334)
To Musazi, that was sacrilege which could not be tolerated in Congress. He proceeded to expel some six of the most significant officials of the UNC who supported the Cairo office. (Apter, D.E. 1961: 334) The response of the six and their political line did not take long to come: at the Annual Delegates Conference held on January 12, 1959, Ignatius Musazi, President of UNC, was expelled from the Congress and Apollo Milton Obote elected to replace him. The conference also went on to endorse all the resolutions taken at the Accra Conference.
The significance of these events are succinctly captured by David Apter's observation: "the old Congress ended . . . Congress had now entered the Pan-African phase of nationalism."(Apter, D.E. 1961: 334) From then on too, the non-Ganda joined UNC in large numbers; "formerly under Ganda leadership, it made little headway."(La Fontaine in Low, D.A. 1971: 254 footnote 64)
Not too long after this conference the Obote wing of UNC merged with the Uganda Peoples Union which had been formed in 1958 to form the Uganda Peoples Congress. From that point UNC was virtually dead and Musazi's political career had essentially come to an end.

Lagrán

Lagrán () is a town and municipality located in the province of Álava, in the Basque Country, northern Spain.
Its name comes from: "larra-gran" which in Spanish means "sobre el prado". This is its main webpage:www.lagran.org
It is located in the south part of Álava in a valley where the river Ega is born. It has an altitude of 756 m above the sea level and near the village, at only 3 km from there, are mountains with a heigh of 1,400 m. There is a huge variety of species of animals or either plants. In this valley potatoes and different types of cereals are grown, for commercial purpose or even for its direct consumption. In the border of this valley there are several forests. There can be frequently seen hunters around this area, either major or minor hunting, because of its variety of fauna. It actually has 126 inhabitants, and its considered to be the oldest village in Alava, its age average is around 70 years old. 
History.
There is little early evidence of this village, but the first documents using the name are from 1165. It was not considered a village then. In 1515, it started to be considered as a village. In the 15th century, Lagrán was no longer an independent village when it became part of the kingdom of the Conde de Salinas and later became part of the kingdom of the Duques de Híjar.
Demography.
When we speak about the demography of this village we can say that it has become to be a small village from being a big or normal village.
Hiking.
There are few activities, but it is possible to play golf, bowl or play tennis. There are many mountains to climb or places to walk.
Senda De Las Carboneras A-PR-50 - This path goes from Lagrán to Cruz del Castillo, before it served to communicate the Cantabrian Sea ports with the people of the Rioja and to trade with oil, bread, and wool in exchange for coal, lime, potatoes, pickled fish etc. On this path you can see three representations that explain the process of making charcoal, one of the greatest cultural treasures of the valley, and some tree species that contribute to enjoy of this walk.
Senda Del Lavadero A-PR-51 - The path which goes from the laundry of Lagrán illustrates the walker a variety of flora and fauna posters, and explanations of the valley. Can also be seen an old site where lime was fabricated and the remains of a sawmill in the mountains.
Senda Del Monte Jaundel A-PR-52 - Along the way we will know some aspects of the landscape, artificial lakes which some farmers made for their animals and a mountain which is between to villages and in the past was used for commercial purposes. We also find some animals and plants species, and a curious machine called "El Burro" which in the past was used to carry thin woods to where the charcoal was made.
Senda De Lagrán A Pipaón A-PR-53 - This path connects the two rural villages covering part of the old existing road and crossing the old lake for watering "La Salmuera" and then returning to the forest where many beeches can be found. Here are explanatory signs of different animals and plants species. You can see the remains of a clay quarry . There also will be explained by some signs how the beeches were used for commercial purposes and also an old hydroelectric generator, and at the same time you will be able to use an observatory of birds. In the village you can visit the Pipaón " Ethnographic Museum " by the Usatxi Cultural Association of Dallas.
Senda De San Bartolomé A-PR-54 - A camping area for groups, with tables, benches, barbecues and a shelter with berths, electricity, toilets, showers etc. But for its use the Lagrán hall must be consulted. This may be the most appropriate point for exploring all the paths. This route, although it can provide all kind of interesting aspects, it is designed for young people, because it is an unknown route, with many posters located around the area, and which may come from different places.
Senda De Lagrán A Villaverde A-PR-55 - This route shares its beginning with the Senda Del Lavadero A-PR-51, going through the Escuela de Golf and comes to Villaverde. In it you can see posters of the vegetation in the area ( beech, oak forest, oak), microfauna (rodents), raptors and other wildlife are explained.

Plano Senior High School

Plano Senior High School (commonly Plano, Plano Senior High, or PSHS) is a public secondary school in Plano, Texas, serving students in grades 11–12. The school is part of the Plano Independent School District, with admission based primarily on the locations of students' homes. Plano is a two-time Blue Ribbon School and a Texas Exemplary School.
Founded in 1891 as Plano Public School, serving both primary and secondary students, the school was, by the mid-1910s, sending a majority of its graduating students on to college. Plano High School, created in 1952 by separating the primary students into Mendenhall Elementary School, was immediately accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, allowing its graduates to enter college without taking an entrance exam. In 1964, Plano High School integrated with the Frederick Douglass School (formerly Plano Colored School), and the integrated football team won the first of the school's seven state championships in 1965. In 1975, the school moved to a new campus with five buildings, very similar to the layout of a junior college, where it has remained since. During the first year only at the new campus, PSHS served 10th - 12th grade, making the Class of 1978 the only class to attend school at this campus for three years.
Plano administers more Advanced Placement tests each year than any other school west of the Mississippi River and all but one school in the United States. The school is accredited by the Texas Education Agency as well as the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Plano was ranked in the top 1,300 high schools in the United States in 2008. Plano's mascot is the Wildcat.
As of the 2005-06 school year, the school had an enrollment of 2,558 students and 148.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 1:17.2.
History.
Plano Public School.
In the 19th century, various private institutions existed within Plano for the education of children. One of these, the Plano Institute, was a private school founded in 1882 that offered an Artium Baccalaureatus degree. On June 9, 1891, the people of Plano determined by a vote that the city should assume control of the schools. In July of that same year, the citizens approved a fifty cent tax for school purposes and for the purchase of the Plano Institute's land and building. The building was used for the new Plano Public School, from which Plano Senior High School would develop. Thus, 1891 is generally considered the school's foundation year. The original school grounds would later become the Cox Administration Building. In 1892, Plano graduated its first class of five people.
In 1899, the Plano Independent School District became a separate entity from the city. Because of this separation, 1899 is cited by the district as the establishment date for Plano Senior High School. Starting in 1901, the school was affiliated with the University of Texas, Baylor, Texas A&M, and Southwestern in order to ensure that graduates could secure entrance to college. Unfortunately for students, official affiliations eventually ended due to budget restrictions. However, the affiliations, coupled with the high standards of Plano schools, led to a large number of graduating students going on to attend college. By the mid-1910s, a majority of the graduating class (as much as eighty percent) matriculated to an institute of higher learning, such as the University of Texas at Austin or Baylor University. According to the 1915 Plano Review, "The University of Texas probably draws more students from Plano than any one other institution." The Review goes on to state that "no town in Texas, in proportion to its size, has more students in higher institutions of learning than Plano."
The original building burned down in 1894 and was reconstructed on the same site. The rebuilt Plano Public School again burned down in the spring of 1903, leading to the construction of yet another new building. The students went to classes in the local Opera House until the completion of the new building, often called the "Spanish School" because of its Moorish architecture. Following its construction, the district built various new facilities to support its students, including a new band hall, gymnasium, and auditorium.
In 1922, the Texas Department of Education informed the district that the Spanish School was "inadequate ... for high school work." By 1924, the district had constructed a new building to house the Plano Public School. In 1935, while the country was in the midst of the Great Depression, the WPA offered to build the district a much-needed new gym. The $125,000 USD (1.61 million 2005 dollars) building, completed in 1938, was used as a gym, auditorium, classroom, and laboratory, allowing new subjects to be taught, including agriculture, business, and home economics. At the time, Texas required that students complete 16 credits, or full semester courses, to graduate. This expansion allowed Plano students a choice of 30 credits with which to fulfill the requirement.
Plano High School.
In September 1952, Mendenhall Elementary School was created, allowing primary students to be separated from secondary students. That same year, the newly created Plano High School was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, allowing its graduates to enter college without taking an entrance exam. In 1961, Plano High School moved to a new location on the east side of town, now the site of Williams High School, and the new building was constructed at a cost of $993,590 (6.2 million 2005 dollars).
Following the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision "Brown v. Board of Education", the Plano school board considered the issue of integrating Plano High School with Plano Colored High School. The school board formed a committee of "colored citizens" to address the concern. Twice, in 1955 and 1957, when asked if they favored integration, the citizens on the committee stated they "were perfectly happy with their school and would like to be left alone." In 1964, the issue was raised again when the school board voted to let students of the Plano Colored School, by then renamed the Frederick Douglass School, decide if they wanted to integrate with Plano High School. The students voted to integrate, and Douglass School became a primary facility. The 1964–1965 football team, the first integrated team for the school, won the first state championship in school history, helping to ease racial tensions. By 1968, Douglass School was closed. The Texas Education Agency later praised the district for its handling of integration, calling it "an exceptional job."
Plano Senior High School.
In the 1970s, in response to massive growth and with a desire to lower dropout rates and increase college readiness, then Superintendent H. Wayne Hendrick began a search for a new way to organize the school system. After touring several successful systems across the country, including those in Flint, Michigan; Cherry Creek, Colorado; Evanston, Illinois; and Hillsboro, Oregon, Hendrick found none of their systems suitable for Plano's needs. He instead decided to create a new senior high system. While the majority of American high schools serve students from grades nine through twelve, Plano's high schools serve only ninth and tenth graders, while senior high schools serve eleventh and twelfth graders. Two high schools feed into each senior high school, such as Plano Senior High. This system allows students to complete most of their required credits in high school and specialize with vocational classes at the senior high.
A plan was created for a campus with five buildings, very similar to the layout of a junior college. The campus now contains six buildings with the addition in 2002 of an indoor workout facility. The buildings are interconnected by greenspace, which features a man-made pond as the central element. The campus was constructed at a cost of 10.3 million U.S. dollars (42.7 million 2010 dollars). The school opened for the 1975–1976 school year with only two buildings completed. By Christmas of 1975, all five buildings were completed, and the school was dedicated on March 7, 1975. The new senior high school offered a broad variety of studies previously unseen in the district. The new facility offered courses in social studies, drama, art, and journalism as well as vocational studies in clothing design, professional childcare, air conditioning repair, and metalworking.
Due to high population growth rates in Plano, Plano East Senior High School opened to juniors in 1981 to alleviate overcrowding. In 1999, Plano West Senior High School opened to juniors for the same purpose. Plano Senior High students currently feed from Vines and Clark High Schools. In 2002, Plano completed an $18 million renovation, making ADA compliance upgrades, and renovations to the science department, HVAC, fire sprinkler, and security systems, and site lighting.
In the fall of 2009, longtime principal Dr. Doyle Dean announced his retirement after serving as principal for 30 years. In the spring of 2010, it was announced that Sarah Watkins would take over the position and to this day she serves as principal
Academics.
Plano operates on an 8:00 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. schedule, which includes eight periods and a break for off-campus lunch during which all students may leave campus to eat lunch, provided the student's parents sign a permission form upon registering the student. Although there are eight available periods, students may only take a maximum of seven unless special permission is given.
Plano offers 31 Advanced Placement courses, which is all of the 34 courses possible with the exception of Latin Literature, Italian Language and Culture, and Japanese Language and Culture. Yearly, the school administers more Advanced Placement tests than any other school west of the Mississippi River, and the second most tests in the United States (2,237 total exams in the year 2005). The school also offers many vocational courses, as was Superintendent Hendrick's intent when it was built. Plano currently offers vocational courses including those in agriculture, family and consumer science, journalism, fashion design, advertising design, drafting, automotive technology, automotive paint and body, clinical rotation, and criminal justice.
In the 2007 graduating class, 97% of graduates went onto college or university: 80% went on to four-year universities, while 17% went to two-year colleges. Students in the class achieved an average composite SAT score of 1163 out of 1600 and a mean composite ACT score of 24.7 out of 36. Many Plano students received National Merit Scholarship accolades in the 2007 school year, including 46 finalists, 54 semi-finalists, and 62 commended students. These individual class statistics are indicative of previous years' performances.
Extracurricular activities.
The extracurricular activities offered at Plano Senior High School are many and varied due to the school's large size. There are chapters of national organizations, such as the National Honor Society, and clubs founded by Plano students, such as Acoustical Word, in which students play guitar and recite poetry. Service organizations such as Key Club coexist alongside clubs which have a primarily social or recreational purpose. The usual range of athletic and music organizations are there for students to join, in addition to Plano's other clubs.
Plano Senior High School teams currently compete in UIL competitions in District 9 of the 5A Class, the class designated for the largest schools. For the 2008–2010 school years, Plano competed in District 8-5A.
Plano's 2007 enrollment for competitive purposes is officially listed as 5240. This is the number used by the UIL when determining what other schools Plano competes against in all UIL-sponsored athletic and academic competitions. This number exceeds the on-site enrollment of Plano Senior High because the official enrollment of each senior high school also includes the enrollment of each of its feeder schools. Ninth and tenth graders who are good enough to compete at the varsity level of a sport may be bused to the senior high school to compete in varsity sports, therefore becoming part of the senior high's talent pool. The number can be fractional because Jasper High School, one of Plano's feeder schools, is also a feeder school for Plano West Senior High School, and therefore the enrollment is split.
Athletics.
Football.
A small group of Plano boys formed an unofficial football team in 1898. In 1900, the first official high school team was formed. In 1909, Superintendent C. F. Walker complained to the local paper, "Do you sleep well at night when you know your boy is on the streets kicking a football?" Despite his concerns, by 1914 Plano fielded a football team and a men's and women's basketball team. However, the First World War cancelled all athletics, as there were not enough men to field any teams.
By 1925, athletics programs had been re-established, and a mascot had been chosen: the Wildcat. The 1925 football team completed an undefeated season, and the resulting fervor led to the increased funding of athletics in Plano. The district allocated funds to purchase a cow pasture for the purpose of playing football and other sports. The pasture was renamed Guy M. Rice Field, after the team's first football coach. By 1939, a "modern" stadium had been built at this site. With the construction of Plano High School in 1957, an accompanying stadium was built, and Rice Field was abandoned. In 1977, Plano completed construction on John Clark Field at a cost of $2.75 million ($8.92 million 2005 dollars). Clark Field, with a capacity of 14,224, is the facility used for most varsity football games today. Kimbrough Stadium, a new stadium in 2004, is also occasionally the site for home games.
Following the integration of Plano High School with Plano Colored School, the football team made its first run at the Texas state championship in 1965. Most of the town shut down to make the drive to Austin and see the Wildcats win their first state championship. After the Wildcats won the championship again in 1967, the team was voted Texas Outstanding Football Team.
The Plano Varsity football team has gone to nine Texas state championships, as detailed below, and won seven. Plano's seven championships were tied for most in the state along with Brownwood, Celina, and Southlake Carroll until Celina won its eighth in the 2007 season.
Following the creation of Plano West Senior High School in 1999, Plano lost much of its player base to the new school, and the 2003 Plano Varsity football team suffered a winless season for the first time in the history of the school. The tenth graders who were recruited to play at the varsity level during the dismal 2003 season became twelfth graders in the 2005 season. Partly due to this extra experience, the 2005 team completed a perfect 10–0 regular season and went 3–1 in the playoffs, finally being defeated by the eventual state champions, Southlake Carroll Dragons.
Coach Jaydon McCullough took the reins as head coach in school history and set school records
during the 2007 season, a team led by quarterback Carson Meger, running back Rex Burkhead and wide receiver Kris Lott, advanced to the state semifinals, until getting beaten in double overtime (27-30) by eventual State Champion Euless Trinity.
Basketball.
The Plano boys' basketball team, which has existed as long as the football team, has taken only three trips to the state championships. After losses in the 1952 and 1980 championships against Dimmitt and Houston Kashmere, respectively, Plano did not return to the tournament again until 2006. On March 11, 2006, the boys' basketball team won the school's first state basketball championship in overtime against Humble Kingwood High School at the Frank Erwin Center in Austin. The game was broadcast across the southwest United States by regional carrier FSN Southwest, and in turn nationally by Fox's digital cable network, Fox College Sports Central.
The girls basketball team has played in one 5A championship, losing to Mansfield High School 69–43 in 2000.
Soccer.
The boys' soccer team has played in seven state championship games and the girls' soccer team has played in six. The boys' team has emerged victorious six times, and the girls' four.
Other sports.
Plano has also had state titles in boys' golf in 1989 and 1994. Plano lost in the team tennis state finals in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1998.
The Plano swim team has been very successful. The boys won state titles in 1991, 1992 and 1998. The girls won in 1988 and 1998. Since the 2000–2001 season there have been 2 national champions, 7 state champions, 1 Texas 5A State Record Holder, 4 Texas 5A Male Swimmers of the Year, and 63 All-Americans.
The Plano boys' and girls' cross country teams have both seen success, including sending Scott McPherson to the 2004 Locker Championship. The 1991 and 1992 Men's teams finished 4th and 3rd in the state respectively.
Music.
Plano Senior High was named by the Grammy Foundation as a "2005 Grammy Signature School Gold" school for their achievement in the arts. In 2008, Plano Senior High School was once again one of two schools in the nation to be named a Grammy Signature School Gold.
Choir.
The Plano Senior High School Varsity Woman's Choir was named Texas's Honor Choir in 2009 under the direction of Derrick Brookins and Christopher Ahrens. In 2012 the Plano Senior High School A Cappella Mixed Choir was announced as being the choir to represent the state of Texas at ACDA. As of 2013, the choir is still under the baton of Derrick Brookins, but Rachel Keen has replaced Doug Council as the Assistant Choral Director.
Band.
An unofficial band was first organized in 1935. In 1955, Plano hired University of Arkansas graduate Emmitt Clem, who led the band for twenty-one years and wrote the school song. The band quickly became widely acclaimed under his direction. The band performed pre-game for the first Dallas Cowboys season and at a nationally televised Cowboys game at the Cotton Bowl in 1962. In June 1976 the Plano band, led by Clem traveled to Washington DC and played on the steps of the US Capitol during national bicentennial events. In the fall 1976 Mr Clem was moved down to Wilson Middle School and Tom Bennett was brought in as band director for two years ending in the 1978; Mr Bennett led the band to perform in the 1977 State championship football game at Texas Stadium where Plano beat Port Neches Groves 13-10. He was followed by Charles Forque as band director. Forque brought close friend Doc Severinsen, band leader of "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson", to the high school every year to play with the band. The band has performed in Carnegie Hall and at The Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic. The Plano band is currently under the direction of Plano alumni Jeremy Kondrat and Michael A. Hernandez and Mr. Lewis. In 2007, The Plano Wind Ensemble was named a 5A National Wind Honor Band, ranking them fifth in the nation. The Jazz Band at Plano is directed by Jeremy Kondrat and has gone on to be chosen to attend the Essentially Ellington Competition in New York City in both 2005 and 2010.
Orchestra.
The Plano Senior High Full Orchestra (composed of the best winds and strings at the school) was named Texas' Honor Full Orchestra in 2007 under the direction of Jeff Turner. Under the direction of Brian Coatney, they were named Texas's Honor Full Orchestra for 2009 and 2011. Plano's String Orchestra was selected as the TMEA honor orchestra in 1993, 1995 and 1998, under the direction of Kathleen DeBerry. In 1995, the Orchestra played at Carnegie Hall. Plano has been named a National Blue Ribbon School in 1984–85 and again in 1994–96.

Val di Noto

Val di Noto (English: "Province of Noto") is a geographical area of south east Sicily; it is dominated by the limestone Iblean plateau.
The Val di Noto in the Arts.
The Val di Noto owes its fame to the reconstruction which underwent after the year 1693, when the entire area was decimated by an enormous earthquake. Following the earthquake, many towns were rebuilt on entirely new sites, such as Noto and Grammichele. The rulers of the time, the kings of Spain, accounted the nobleman Giuseppe Lanza with special powers, which allowed him to redesign the damaged towns based on rational and scenographic town plans.
In fact, since the beginning of the Renaissance, architects had the dream to build an entirely new ideal city, where town planning follows rational design and streets and buildings are organized by functionality and beauty. However, only a very small part of their projects were really used, and most of them were limited to the reorganization of a street, like the Strada Nuova in Florence or the redesign of small villages, like the town of Pienza.
The earthquake gave the architects the chance to carry out those plans on a large scale. These new towns and cities were therefore redesigned according to renaissance and baroque town planning, with streets crossing each other either in a right angle or starting from major urban sites like squares with a radial pattern. Major buildings like churches, cloisters and palaces were built in order to give the streets a focal point and a majestic perspective.
Many of these towns had a distinct shape, like the town of Grammichele which is based on a hexagon whose centre is the town square, consisting of the parish and town hall.
Another feature is the homogeneous structure of these towns, as the late baroque style developed in Sicily was extensively used in the rebuilding.
The area's towns were rebuilt in what came to be known as the Sicilian Baroque style; most notable the town of Noto itself, which is now a tourist attraction on account of its fine Baroque architecture.
The ancient town of "Akrai" (Palazzolo Acreide) was founded in 664 BCE: it was the first colony of the Corinthian settlement at Syracuse. The Syracusans steadily expanded their power over the Sicilian interior. Scarcely recorded, the ruined town was rediscovered by the historian Tommaso Fazello at the end of 16th century. Further excavations in the early 19th century by Baron Gabriele Iudica, unearthed important facts concerning the early history of eastern Sicily.
In June 2002, UNESCO inscribed eight old towns of the Val di Noto on the World Heritage List as "representing the culmination and final flowering of Baroque art in Europe". The listed towns are Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.

Canute V of Denmark

Canute V Magnussen () ( – 9 August 1157) was a King of Denmark from 1146 to 1157, as co-regent in shifting alliances with his Sweyn III and Valdemar I. Canute was killed at the so-called "Bloodfeast of Roskilde" in 1157. Nothing certain is known about his person and character.
Biography.
Canute was born around 1129, the son of King Niels' son Magnus I of Sweden. After the abdication of Eric III in 1146, the magnates of Jutland declared Canute king, while the magnates of Zealand and Scania crowned Sweyn III, the nephew of Canute Lavard who Magnus had killed in 1131.
In the following years, Canute tried in vain to defeat Sweyn III on Zealand for complete control over Denmark. In 1147, Canute and Sweyn united to undertake the Wendish Crusade, which however ended in the re-ignition of their strife. Sweyn and his cousin Duke Valdemar, the son of Canute Lavard, defeated Canute in Jutland in 1150, and Canute fled to his father-in-law Sverker I of Sweden. Canute attempted a number of reconquests, all of them unsuccessful, and turned to Frederick Barbarossa for help. The resulting compromise of 1152, which was supported by Valdemar, made Canute the inferior co-regent of Sweyn. However, Sweyn decided not to effectuate the deal
Canute now formed an alliance with Valdemar and Sverker, whose daughter Helena of Sweden Canute was to marry. Sweyn fled Denmark in 1154, and Canute struck a deal with Valdemar, making him his co-ruler under the name Valdemar I. Canute was an inferior king to Valdemar, and after Sweyn's re-entry into Denmark, a final compromise was struck in 1157, under pressure from the Danish magnates. Sweyn, Canute, and Valdemar were set up as co-rulers, with Canute ruling Zealand. During the peace banquet in Roskilde on 9 August 1157, later known as the "Bloodfeast of Roskilde", Sweyn attempted to kill both Canute and Valdemar. Canute was allegedly killed by one of Sweyn's warriors.
Canute's half-sister Sofia of Minsk married Valdemar, who avenged him the same year by killing Sweyn at the Battle of Grathe Heath to win Denmark for himself.
Issue.
Not more than a year before his death, Canute married Helena of Sweden, but they had no children. Canute fathered a number of children out of wedlock:

The PTA Disbands

"The PTA Disbands" is the 21st episode of "The Simpsons"' sixth season. It originally aired on April 16, 1995. In the episode, Edna Krabappel calls an emergency strike on behalf of the Teachers' Union of Springfield Elementary, to protest against Principal Skinner's miserly school spending. Students react in their own manner to the strike: Lisa becomes obsessed with a desire to be graded, while Bart enjoys the extra time he has during the day. Bart arranges to keep the teachers union and Principal Skinner at an impasse, but becomes frustrated with substitute teacher arrangements and resolves to force negotiations forward. The situation is resolved when Krabappel and Skinner agree to rent space in classroom closets to the Springfield Prison.
The episode was written by Jennifer Crittenden and directed by Swinton O. Scott III, with David Mirkin as show-runner. The episode includes cultural references to a number of books highlighted by Edna Krabappel as having been banned by other schools – including William Shatner's "TekWar", "Steal This Book" by Abbie Hoffman, and "The Theory of Evolution" by Charles Darwin. The episode received favorable mention in books on "The Simpsons" and media reviews, and was cited by academicians, who analyzed portions of the episode from physics and psychology perspectives. During a 2004 strike by voice actors for "The Simpsons" during salary negotiations, media sources cited an iconic quote from Homer to Lisa in the episode about the teachers' strike.
Plot.
After a failed attempt at a school field trip, which appears to have caused the apparent abandonment and brutal beating of the student Üter, Edna Krabappel calls an emergency strike on behalf of the Teachers' Union of Springfield Elementary, to protest against Principal Skinner's miserly spending on school supplies and activities.
As the teachers' strike results in the closing of the school, the various student characters respond to the sudden turn of events in their own ways: Lisa becomes increasingly obsessive in her desire to be graded, Milhouse is forced by his parents to take private tutoring lessons (which improve his education), Jimbo Jones finds himself immersed in the intricacies of daytime soap operas with his mother, Dolph and Kearney become easily bored with video games, and Bart revels in his newfound afternoon freedom and annoys many Springfield citizens by imitating other people to make them angry or hurt each other. In particular, Bart does what he can to keep the union and Principal Skinner at odds with each other. The two sides are at an impasse; the union wanting a restoration of funding and Skinner maintaining that even with the spending reductions he has made, government budget cuts have squeezed the school dry.
After some prompting from an exasperated Marge Simpson, the parents of Springfield eventually decide to take matters into their own hands, and recruit volunteers from the community to take over as temporary teachers. This turns out to be even worse for the students than before the strike, especially as Marge becomes Bart's new teacher and Jasper becomes Lisa's new teacher and gets his beard stuck in a pencil sharpener. Due to Marge's excessive mothering of Bart, he grudgingly resolves to force the strike negotiations forward. Together with Milhouse, he tricks both Krabappel and Principal Skinner into entering Skinner's office, which he then locks behind them. After spending several hours trapped together "like prisoners" in their own school, the two are mutually inspired with an idea to create extra revenue for more school spending. Things return to normal with the old teachers in charge, but with the school cloakrooms having been rented to the Springfield Prison. Each classroom now features several full prison cells at the back, which have the added benefit of keeping the more troublesome students in line. Snake Jailbird makes a deal with Bart to get him out of prison, promising him to "make it worth your while", to which Bart responses shorty afterwards "I'm listening".
Production.
The episode was written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came in to the writers' room and pitched the idea that there should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his experience as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when Flanders tells him the PTA has not disbanded.
The episode was directed by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down to give the impression that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.
Cultural references.
During their field trip, the bus from Springfield Elementary arrives at the Fort Springfield civil war site and skids into a cannon, knocking one of its wheels off. The cannon then points at the tower leg of a lookout, giving the impression that it will fire at the lookout and destroy it, which is a reference to the opening sequence of the television sitcom "F Troop". The lookout was also modeled after the lookout in the show. The scene in which Üter is left behind at the end of the field trip is based on a scene from the 1965 film "Von Ryan's Express".
Edna points at some school books and says: "The only books we have are ones that were banned by other schools." Skinner picks up a book called "TekWar", and says: "Well, the kids have to learn about "TekWar" sooner or later," referencing William Shatner's series of science fiction novels. Other books in the bookshelf include "Sexus" by Henry Miller, "Hop on Pop" by Dr. Seuss, "The Satanic Verses" ("Junior Illustrated Edition") by Salman Rushdie, "40 Years of Playboy" by Hugh Hefner, "Steal This Book" by Abbie Hoffman, and "The Theory of Evolution" by Charles Darwin.
Bart tells Skinner in the principal's office that Edna told him that Skinner "folds faster than Superman on laundry day", a reference to the comic book character Superman. That line is one of "The Simpsons" animator David Silverman's favorite lines on the show. Gabe Kaplan is one of Bart's victims on his substitute list, a reference to Kaplan and his character in the 1975 TV series "Welcome Back, Kotter". The character at the bank who tells the angry crowd that their money's in "Bill's house, and Fred's house" is based on James Stewart's George Bailey character in the bank run scene from "It's a Wonderful Life".
Reception.
In its original broadcast, "The PTA Disbands" finished 69th in ratings for the week of March 13–19, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 7.1. It was the 8th highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.
In their book "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood describe "The PTA Disbands" as "Possibly the best of the school episodes." In a review of the sixth season of "The Simpsons", Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide writes: "I especially like the contrasts between how Bart and Lisa accept the strike. The show doesn’t quite manage to soar consistently, but it has more than enough to make it positive." In his review of the episode for "TV Squad", Adam Finley comments: "I love how Bart and Lisa both handle the news differently. Bart is thrilled ... Lisa, on the other hand, can't handle not being graded and evaluated every day, and slowly begins to lose her mind."
In 2004, when the voice actors for "The Simpsons" went on strike requesting additional income, "The Scotsman" cited a quote by Homer from the episode: "If you don't like your job, you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American Way." "The Scotsman" asserted "Homer would not approve" of the strike by the voice actors. The voice actors were asking for an increase from US$125,000 to $360,000 per episode. The same quote by Homer to Lisa was cited by Michael Schneider in "Daily Variety", who wrote: "...insiders note that the actors work just six to seven hours to voice an episode --- which would mean $ 360,000 for a day's work, a figure that even "Everybody Loves Raymond" star Ray Romano doesn't match."
University of the Sciences in Philadelphia physics and mathematics professor Paul Halpern discusses the episode in his book "What's Science Ever Done for Us?: What the Simpsons Can Teach Us About Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe", and quotes Homer's admonition to Lisa: "Lisa, in this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!" at the beginning of Halpern's section on "Mechanical Plots". Halpern describes Lisa's efforts to build a perpetual-motion machine while bored during the teachers strike, and comments that though it is absurd in reality to order someone to obey the laws of thermodynamics, he acknowledges that "physicists sometimes don't know the proper arena within which certain laws apply". In the July 26, 2007 issue of "Nature", the scientific journal's editorial staff listed "The PTA Disbands" among "The Top Ten science moments in "The Simpsons"", writing: "Lisa gets so bored by a lack of schooling she builds a perpetual motion machine. Homer is not pleased: 'Lisa, in this house we OBEY the laws of thermodynamics.'"
The episode is cited by Robert M. Arkin and Philip J. Mazzocco in their work "Self-Esteem in Springfield", in the compilation book "The Psychology of The Simpsons". Arkin and Mazzocco note an exchange between Edna Krabappel and Seymour Skinner, where Skinner exclaims to Krabappel: "Oh come on Edna: We both know these kids "have" no future! ["All the children stop and look at him; he chuckles nervously"] Prove me wrong, kids. Prove me wrong." Arkin and Mazzocco note that this example is seen as an exception, writing: "Generally, however, the Simpsons are right on target in their understanding of the importance of self-esteem and the dynamics involved in the interplay between the social world and positive self-regard."

Thomas &amp; Friends magazines

There have been many magazines made and sold called Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends magazines. These feature stories, games, puzzles, character information and other things about Thomas the Tank Engine and his friends. Many Thomas magazines are now old and hard to find, but are prized by many collectors. Many of the magazines has a certain theme.
The magazines feature unique stories, many of which are not televised, with some examples being 'James and the Seeds', 'Sunshine and Showers', 'Deep Dive', and 'The Cloud Factory'.
The Thomas magazines also introduce characters only found in them. Some examples are:
Characters.
Sidney the Little Blue Engine.
Sidney is a small light blue 0-4-2 tank engine, who runs a small branch line near the Seasides of Sodor. He loves chuffing around, pulling passengers to the Funfair and back. He is friends with Duck the Great Western Engine.
Sidney is a narrow-gauge engine, and he is the same prototype as Peter Sam. He hasn't been featured in the TV Series or The Railway Series.
Victor the Old Engine.
Victor is an old 4-4-0 blue tank engine with red stripes, who was scrapped a long time ago. This made him sad, but one day he was found and restored into a children's playground. He now sits in a park, and enjoys the company of children, climbing in and out of him.
Victor is the only 4-4-0 tank engine on the Island, and isn't in the Railway Series or TV Series. His prototype is currently unknown.
Angus the Fire Engine.
Angus is a large red fire engine, who lives and works with the Sodor Fire Brigade. He works hard helping out with fires, and rescues. He likes to work hard, and has plenty of friends.
Angus is based on a 1934 Dennis Fire Engine, and isn't in the Railway Series or TV Series. He's the second character to have separate eyes (after Caroline).
No.13 the Unlucky Engine.
No. 13 is a black tank engine with an open cab who was featured in the Thomas & Friends Magazines. When he first arrived on the Island of Sodor, he was very unlucky, and caused Donald and Douglas trouble and mayhem. While he was there, he got his firebox damaged, and stuck in a landslide! The Fat Controller sent him to the works, and Donald thought that would be the end of him, he came back, with a bigger firebox, as The Fat Controller said 'Your firebox is too small for an engine like you!'
Because he was the number 13, a very unlucky number, his number may be the cause of his bad luck.
No. 13 was only featured in one story, and hasn't been seen on the TV Series. He also has a toy-like appearance like Lady.
Little Barford the little engine.
Little Barford is a purple tank engine, with red stripes and his name on the side, and has a somewhat striking resemblance to Peter Sam. As his name suggests, he is a small engine, and works on a little line near a Factory. When Gordon the Big Engine called Percy the Small Engine small, Percy met Little Barford, and then told Gordon he was middle sized.
Little Barford only appeared in the story 'The Cloud Factory', and hasn't been released on the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends TV Series.
The White Van.
The White Van is a white road vehicle featured in the Thomas & Friends Magazines, it had eyes in his headlamps instead of having an actual face. He came to the Island of Sodor to help out, but only caused trouble, when he and his driver made fun of the steam engines. He caused further trouble when his driver left his door open, which led to a squashed mattress. The White Van ended up being taken off the road when it parked in a wrong place.
The White Van's name was never revealed, and was only featured in one story.
The Naughty Pink Truck.
The Naughtiest truck after S.C.Ruffey. After Thomas was boasting about his new coat of paint, then the trucks mentioned they didn't like black paint, then he told all the trucks to be so naughty so that they could get new coats of paint. The Fat Controller explained about the grime and dirt being hidden on them with the black, but he sent this truck to the works to be painted, he was painted pink. The Fat Controller told him that the pink will wear off in the end.
It hasn't appeared on the TV series, but TOMY has released Lady with pink trucks.
The Animal Sanctuary Coach.
Appearing in "An Old Friend", the nearby animal shelter is getting full, Thomas soon sees the old coach in an old siding, paintworn and everything, he recalls the days that the express pulled him and taking people station to station, Thomas had an idea and got a crane to send him to the works, when he came back, he was in the animal sanctuary as an animal home, he is very happy there, and Thomas is glad too!
Bennet and Co. Truck.
Another truck in the magazines, with the words 'BENNET AND CO.' written on his sides, seen in Deep Dive. Thomas was working at the garbage canal with him, he was being filled with iron, but he got overweighed, making hin fall into a river. In the end, he was rescued by a floating crane and got the rest of the day off.
Unnamed Workshop Engines.
These two appeared in the comic story, 'Chiff Chaff'. They are seen in the works where Edward is sent to be fixed. The first one seems to be a green tender engine with green smoke deflectors (possibly an LMS Patriot Class -mostly an LMS Royal Scot Class), and the second is seen as a silver electric tram engine. There was another one, but you can only see his eyes.

Tiede Herrema

Dr Tiede Herrema (born 21 April 1921) is a Dutch businessman. He was born in Zuilen.
In the 1970s, Herrema ran a wire factory, Ferenka, in the city of Limerick, Ireland. At the time, this was the city's biggest employer, with approximately 1,400 workers. On the morning of 3 October 1975 Herrema was abducted having just left his home in Castletroy near Limerick by two members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, Eddie Gallagher and Marion Coyle. The kidnappers demanded the release of three IRA prisoners, including Rose Dugdale.
After a massive security operation, the kidnappers were eventually traced on 21 October 1975 to a house in Monasterevin, County Kildare. After a further two week long siege, Herrema was released, shaken but unharmed. He left Ireland soon after.
He eventually returned to present an episode of "Saturday Live". He and his wife Elizabeth were made honorary Irish citizens in 1975, and he was made a Freeman of the city of Limerick.
In 2005, he donated his personal papers to the University of Limerick.

Luis Cancer

Luis Cancer de Barbastro or Luis de Cancer (1500 – June 26, 1549) was a Dominican priest and pioneer Spanish missionary to the New World. He undertook a non-violent approach to converting the American Indians to Christianity, and had significant success in this regard in the Caribbean and later in Guatemala. In 1549 he continued his mission work in Florida, an area already ravaged by previous explorers, and was killed on the shores of Tampa Bay. After his death he was regarded as a martyr of the Catholic Church.
Early life.
Cancer was born at Barbastro in Aragon in 1500. Luis entered the Dominican order and was inspired like many of his time to go to the New World in an effort to spread Christianity.
Fray de Cancer came to the New World in 1518 and worked successfully for some time among the native peoples of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. He then ventured to the mainland and had particular success in Guatemala. A disciple of the famed Indian protector, Bartolomé de las Casas, Father de Cancer's efforts were so successful in an area that was known for its bellicose natives, that it was renamed the “Province of True Peace.” He believed that aggression and violence were counter-productive to the spread of the Gospel and that the native peoples needed to be treated with dignity. He had great success in pacifying the Indians whom more violent methods had failed to subdue. He upheld the cause of the natives at an ecclesiastical assembly held in Mexico in 1546.
Florida expedition and death.
Following his missionary success in Guatemala, Cancer proposed a peaceful mission to Florida. The peninsula had already been ravaged by the expeditions of Panfilo Narváez and Hernando de Soto and was regarded as very hostile to Westerners, and Cancer argued that further violence would never bring about its conversion and submission. In 1547, King Charles V approved Cancer's Florida mission. However, the royal decree stipulated that the mission land at la Florida's upper East Coast, avoiding hostile territory in southern Florida and the Gulf Coast where earlier conquistadors had gone.
Cancer recruited fellow Dominicans Gregorio de Beteta, Diego de Tolosa, Juan Garcia, and a certain Brother Fuentes. Leaving Vera Cruz, they reached Havana in 1549. There, they took on a converted Florida Indian, Magdalena, a "highly recommended" interpreter. The expedition then left for Florida on a caravel captained by Juan de Arena. Despite the warnings to avoid the Gulf Coast, Arena took them to an area south of Tampa Bay, only miles from where the previous expeditions had landed. There, they encountered a group of apparently peaceful and receptive Indians, who told them about the many populous villages of the Tocobaga chiefdom around Tampa Bay. Perceiving the possibility of goodwill, the expedition split, with Magdalena, Diego de Tolosa, Brother Fuentes, and an unknown sailor joining the Indians on the half-day's land route, and Cancer returning to the caravel to meet them at the bay.
The caravel reached Tampa Bay on June 23, 1549, however, only Magdalena and a group of Indians greeted them. Magdalena, now "much changed" and wearing Indian attire, told Cancer that she had convinced the local chief that the friars were peaceful, and that the other Spaniards were now his guests. Cancer and the others returned to the caravel that evening, and on board they found Juan Munos, a sailor who had been enslaved by the Indians years before but now escaped. Munos indicated that the Tocobaga had killed the two friars and enslaved the sailor. Beteta and Garcia wanted to flee immediately and sail for the East Coast, however Cancer refused to leave a land "hallowed by the life blood" of his compatriots. The next day, the three men rowed to shore, where they saw a group of hostile Indians, and Cancer exited the boat. He waded to shore and prayed for a while. Upon rising, he was brought to the group and beaten to death with clubs.
More recent recognition.
Though not a canonized saint, he is nevertheless regarded as the Proto-martyr of Florida. In 1860, Bishop Augustin Verot decided that the first parish on Florida’s West Coast should be named St. Louis Church in his honor. Likewise, in 1918 Fr. de Cancer's likeness was installed as part of a large stained glass window at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (New York) run by the Dominican Order of priests. In 1998 the Diocese of St. Petersburg established the Fr. Luis de Cancer Distinguished Priestly Service Award to be given annually to a priest of the Diocese of St. Petersburg who best exemplifies selfless and dedicated service to the people of God. Espiritu Santo Catholic Church in Safety Harbor, Florida which is not far from the location of his death, also has a stained glass window that depicts de Cancer's martyrdom. In 2011 the diocese placed a Catholic Heritage Marker at the main entrance of that church, acknowledging both his and other early Catholic missionary efforts in the Tampa Bay area.

Roman de Rou

Roman de Rou is a verse chronicle by Wace in Norman covering the history of the Dukes of Normandy from the time of Rollo of Normandy to the battle of Tinchebray in 1106. It is a national epic of Normandy.
Following the success of his "Roman de Brut" which recounted the history of the Britons, Wace was apparently commissioned by Henry II of England to write a similar account of the origins of the Normans and their conquest of England. Wace abandons his tale before bringing it up to date, telling the reader in the final lines of Part III that the king had entrusted the same task to a "Maistre Beneeit" (believed to be Benoît de Sainte-More).
The work was started in the year 1160, and Wace seems to have performed his last revisions in the mid-1170s.
Composition.
The work consists of:
A 750-line section known as "Le Romaunz de Rou et des dus de Normendie" appended in some editions appears to be an early draft, abandoned and later reworked into the final redaction.

<doc id="2896684" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2896684" title="Berthold Lubetkin">
Berthold Lubetkin

Berthold Romanovich Lubetkin (14 December 1901— 23 October 1990) was a Russian émigré architect who pioneered modernist design in Britain in the 1930s. His work includes the Highpoint housing complex, London Zoo penguin pool, Finsbury Health Centre and Spa Green Estate.
Early years.
Although certificates exist stating that his birth was in Warsaw in 1903, Lubetkin described these as false documents which he had used to conceal time spent in the Red Army. It is believed he was born in Tbilisi, (now the capital of Georgia), into a Jewish family. His father, Roman (Reuben) Aronovich Lubetkin (1885, St. Petersburg - 1942, Auschwitz), was a civil engineer for the railroad. Lubetkin studied in Moscow and Leningrad where he witnessed the Russian Revolution of 1917 and absorbed elements of Constructivism, both as a participant in street festivals and as a student at VKhUTEMAS.
Lubetkin practiced in Paris in the 1920s in partnership with Jean Ginsburg, with whom he designed an apartment building on the Avenue de Versailles (number 25). In Paris he associated with the leading figures of the European Avant Garde including Le Corbusier. He continued to participate in the debates of Constructivism, designing a trade pavilion for the USSR in Bordeaux and participating in the Palace of the Soviets competition, for which his entry was shortlisted.
Tecton in the 1930s.
Emigrating to London in 1931, Lubetkin set up the architectural practice Tecton. The first projects of TECTON included landmark buildings for London Zoo, the gorilla house and a penguin pool (clearly showing the influence of Naum Gabo). Lubetkin and Tecton set up the Architects and Technicians Organisation in 1936. 
Tecton were also commissioned by London Zoo to design buildings for their reserve park at Whipsnade and to design a completely new zoo in Dudley. Dudley Zoo consisted of twelve animal enclosures and was a unique example of early Modernism in the UK. All of the original enclosures survive, apart from the penguin pool, which was demolished in 1979. According to the 20th Century Society: 'Encapsulated in the playful pavilions at Dudley is a call to remember the higher calling of all architecture, embracing not just material needs but also the desire to inspire and delight.'
Tecton's housing projects included private houses in Sydenham, one of the UK's few modernist terraces at 85-91 Genesta Road in Plumstead, south London, and most famously the Highpoint apartments in Highgate. Highpoint One was singled out for particular praise by Le Corbusier, while Highpoint Two exhibited a more surreal style, with its patterned facade and caryatids at the entrance.
A detached three bedroom villa (64 Heath Drive, Romford) which won a Gold Medal at the local '1934 Modern Homes Exhibition' is interesting in that study of its layout and the floating horizontals of the elevations strongly suggest that it was used as a design prototype for Highpoint One's final form. Sympathetically restored under the supervision of English Heritage and listed Grade2, this villa is regarded by many as demonstrating the best features of the Tecton group style.
The Labour Party council in the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury were major patrons of Tecton, commissioning the Finsbury Health Centre, which was completed in 1938. Lubetkin and Tecton's achievement in Finsbury was to unite the aesthetic and political ambitions of Modernism with the radical municipal socialism of the Borough. The health centre resolved the tension between three key modernist ideals. First: a social function; universal access to healthcare free at the point of use for the borough's residents (a decade before the NHS). Second, the political; no longer was social good to be achieved through charity or hope, instead it was provided by a democratically elected and accountable municipal authority, funded through local taxation. And third, the element which made Tecton's work unique, the aesthetic. The building's tiled facade shone above the surrounding slums, its rational conception asserted the ideal of a socialist future as the rational endgame to progress; in Lubetkin's words the architecture "cried out for a new world". 
Lubetkin's modernism - 'nothing is too good for ordinary people' - laid down a challenge to the class bound complacency of thirties Britain. But Tecton's plans to replace Finsbury's slums with modern flatted housing were stopped by the onset of war in 1939.
Paradoxically the war would move Lubetkin's work from the radical fringe to the mainstream. As the fighting progressed, the British government became increasingly committed to the idea of building a fairer society when peacetime came. As this was articulated through propaganda, Modernist architecture became the visual expression for this radiant future. Abram Games designed a series of posters comparing the promise of modernism, one featuring the Finsbury Health Centre, with the appalling realities of pre war Britain. The uncompromising title to each poster was: 'Your Britain- Fight for it Now'. A further sign of this political shift was the erection in 1941 of a statue in memorial to Lenin. Designed by Lubetkin, the memorial marked the site of Lenin's lodgings at Holford Square, London in 1902/3. The Monument had been defaced many times by those opposed to Communist Russia and its ideals at the time. This resulted in the monument being placed under 24-hour police guard.
Post-war.
The post-war Labour victory was built on the promise of modernism as pioneered by Tecton. The Finsbury Health Centre became a model for the new National Health Service. To confirm the significance of Lubetkin's vision, the Minister of Health Aneurin Bevan laid the foundation stone to Tecton/Finsbury's Spa Green Estate in winter 1946. Spa Green remained the flagship estate, adapting many features from the luxury Highpoint flats for working families (including lifts, central heating, balconies, daylight from multiple directions, and a spectacular roof terrace); in 1998 it received a high Grade II* listing for its architectural significance and the 2008 restoration brought back the original colour scheme. 
Spa Green was the first of a series of housing projects for the practice including Finsbury's Priory Green Estate and Tecton's work in Paddington (led by Denys Lasdun) at the Hallfield Estate. These all showed a more decorative, patterned style which contrasted greatly with the Brutalist style that was soon to emerge as the dominant form of welfare state architecture. Ironically, however, several features of Lubetkin's 1940s neo-Constructivist modernism have become staples of postmodern architecture, for example at Spa Green the floating roof canopy, the stairwells marked by repeated clusters of square 'windows', and the acute-angled canted meeting lodge.
For most of these projects Lubetkin and Tecton worked closely with Ove Arup as structural engineer. Arup's innovative concrete 'egg-crate' construction at Spa Green gave each flat clear views unobstructed by internal pillars, and his aerodynamic 'wind roof' provided a communal area for drying clothes and social gathering.
In 1947 Lubetkin was commissioned to be master planner and chief architect for the Peterlee new town. The following year Tecton was dissolved. Commenting on this, Lubetkin wrote to fellow Tecton member Carl Ludwig Franck "that after the war Tecton was at best a ghost of its former self".
Lubetkin's masterplan for Peterlee included a new civic centre for which he proposed a number of high rise towers. However the extraction of coal was to continue under the town for several years which posed a risk of subsidence. As a result the National Coal Board (NCB), itself an agency of the Ministry of Fuel and Power would only consider a dispersed low density development. Despite investigating a number of options that would have allowed coal extraction to continue without preventing the proposed development, the NCB would not alter their policy. As Lubetkin was the employee of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning this developed into an inter-ministerial battle, and despite attempts at dispute resolution at cabinet level the difference in approach between the ministries remained. Frustrated at the unresolved bureaucratic battles, Lubetkin resigned from the Peterlee project in spring 1950. The only physical sign of his involvement in the scheme exists in the adjoining opposed parabola forms of the road layout at Thorntree Gill.
Lubetkin returned to Finsbury to complete (in collaboration with Francis Skinner) and Douglas Bailey) his final project for the Borough, Bevin Court. Initially named Lenin Court the housing scheme was to incorporate Lubetkin's Lenin Memorial. Post-war austerity had imposed far greater budgetary constraints than in the showpiece Spa Green Estate, forcing Lubetkin to strip the project of the basic amenities he had planned; there were to be no balconies, community centre or nursery school. Instead Lubetkin focused his energies on the social space. Fusing his aesthetic and political concerns he created a stunning constructivist staircase - a social condenser that forms the heart of the building.
But the scheme marked a shift in British housing policy. To save costs, Lubetkin successfully made significant use of prefabricated floor and wall components. Less beneficially, the diminished social provision forced on the architects by the reduced budget would be repeated with far worse consequences across post-war Britain. And also beyond the control of the architects was a political statement. Before the building was completed the Cold war had intensified and as a result the scheme was renamed Bevin Court (honouring Britain's firmly anti-communist foreign secretary Ernest Bevin). In defiance, Lubetkin buried his memorial to Lenin under the central core to his staircase. To this day it underpins the social heart of the building, perhaps waiting for a more promising future.
Tecton's work would also be a major influence on the Festival of Britain. However Lubetkin's efforts to gain employment with the London County Council (the authority with responsibility for building the Festival) were rebuffed.
Frustrated, Lubetkin spent increasing time at the Gloucestershire farm he had managed for Beamish family since the start of WWII, before purchasing it for himself. Though he failed to win several design competitions during the 1950s, he (again with Bailey and Skinner) designed three large council estates in London's Bethnal Green (now a part of Tower Hamlets). These schemes, the Cranbrook Estate, Dorset Estate (which featured the tower Sivill House) and the Lakeview Estate all made increased use of precast concrete façade panels while developing the idiom of complicated abstract facades and Constructivist staircases established in the 1940s.
Lubetkin eventually moved to Bristol where he lived with his wife. He campaigned in later life to protect the views of Brunel's Clifton Bridge; for Lubetkin, Brunel epitomised the spirit of technological progress which had first attracted him to England. In 1982 Lubetkin was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal. He died in Bristol in 1990. Lubetkin (with Tecton) was the subject of a travelling exhibition sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain which opened at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol and toured the UK and Europe 1980 - 1983, under the title "Lubetkin and Tecton: architecture and social commitment". This featured specially commissioned models and illustrative material from his archive and was designed by David King. He was also the subject of a Design Museum exhibition in 2005. His daughter, Louise Kehoe, published an award-winning memoir in 1995 which included previously unknown details of Lubetkin's early years.
In 2009 East Durham & Houghall Community College, based in Peterlee, named its theatre after Lubetkin in honour of the vision he had for the town. The Lubetkin Theatre was officially opened by his daughter Sasha Lubetkin on 5 October 2009. At the opening Sasha Lubetkin said: “I’m immensely proud that this beautiful theatre has been named after my father and that his work is remembered in spite of the brutal way it ended. He had such dreams for Peterlee, he wanted to turn it into the miners capital of the world. His respect and admiration of the miners made him want to create something really special that didn’t exist anywhere else but unfortunately that wasn’t possible."
The British Cement Association established the Berthold Lubetkin Memorial Lecture, the first given by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando in 1992, and RIBA the annual Lubetkin Prize for International Architecture.

Salvatierra/Agurain

Salvatierra in Spanish and Agurain in Basque (officially "Agurain/Salvatierra"), it is a town and municipality located in the province of Álava in the Basque Autonomous Community, northern Spain. The municipality, numbering 4,407 inhabitants (2007), is in turn the head town of the district or "Cuadrilla of Salvatierra". The gross income per family amounts to 6,784 € (1997, Basque Autonomous Community: 8,258 €). With reference to workforce by economic sectors, 10.36% are employed in agriculture, 35.78% in the industry sector, 47.92% in the service sector and 5.95% in the construction industry (data not available for the municipality, applies to the larger Salvatierra District).
The council is headed by Ms Maider Garcia de Vicuña, of the coalition Bildu.
Geography.
The municipality, located at the centre of the eastern Alavese Plains, comprises a core built-up area sitting on a low ridge (605 m high) and consisting of three historical streets that stretch out south to north, i.e. "Zapatari", "Mayor" and "Carnicería", which bear witness to ancient guild clusters. North and west at the feet of the ridge, two watercourses, the Santa Barbara and Zadorra, outlined the town's limits not time ago, while increasingly absorbed by the rapid urban development. Outside the walls of the town spread age old neighbourhoods, such as the Madura (Basque for 'swamp'), La Magdalena or San Jorge. On either side of the road connecting the 'Portal del Rey' (main south entrance to the town) and the train station, a sprawl developed in the 1950s and 1960s, called La Moncloa. The town keeps on growing east beside the Madura through new housing projects in the 2000s (decade), i.e. Harresi Parkea.
There are other minor nuclei (villages) dotting the outward lands of the municipality of Salvatierra as follows:

Agurain benefits from its location on the important European road axis N-1 E-5 E-80 and the Northern Railway, following that it developed industry since the early 20th century. In this respect, it is worth mentioning the one time stinky Curtidos Salvatierra S.A.L., a tanning factory, which provided not long ago work for so many inhabitants. Nowadays the town numbers three industrial estates, the two existing so far and a new one under construction, namely, "Litutxipi" across the train station, "Agurain" on the west (with PEM, former PUM Española, as its traditional flagship factory; maximum surface area for building 19,773 m2) and "Galzar" (urbanization works under way in 2008, maximum surface area for building 14,035 m2). The two latter industrial estates participate in a wider regional logistic scheme known as "Vitoria Logistic Corridor".
A solar power plant in the outskirts of the town was inaugurated in 2007, currently the biggest in the Basque Autonomous Community, with a view to injecting into the power network 350,000 kWh/year.
History.
The town of Salvatierra was founded in 1256 by the Castilian king Alfonso X on the former settlement of the village Hagurahin on top of a hill, a highly defensible position. Castile was intent on strengthening the territories bordering on the Kingdom of Navarre seized some decades ago. As a result, the king founded various strongholds or free towns ("salvas terras", "seguras" and "villas francas") over the lands of Gipuzkoa and Álava in route to Gascony through the northern Way of St. James, with a view at the same time to fostering Castilian trade.
Salvatierra was in the ensuing decades and centuries home to various scuffles, battles and sieges on the grounds of its bordering location with Navarre and its strategic position in the King's Highway to France. In the 13th century, the definitive layout of the town was established, with encircling walls and two big fortified churches sealing Salvatierra at the north and south ends ("Santa Maria" and "San Juan" churches respectively). The so-called "olbeas" were erected at this time too. These consisted of arcades, made originally of wood, next to both parishes in the one-time bustling marketplaces, and they have endured up to the present, although reconstructed in the 16th century.
The town thrived on its good location and trade in the Way of St. James, and it even had a Jewish quarter, located in today's 'Arramel' st. In 1521 the town had to fend off the attack of its own lord, the Count of Salvatierra, a rebellious leader that revolted against emperor Charles V in the Revolt of the Comuneros. Yet he failed to win the town, the Count was arrested and executed by the imperial forces, much to the joy of the inhabitants. The joy didn't last long though, since shortly afterwards the plague swept through the town, which eventually resulted in the burning of Salvatierra (1564), a disaster that some blame on a desperate attempt to put an end to the grim epidemic. Only the walls (and both main churches) were spared, almost the whole town was destroyed, a fact reflected in poems by the writer Juan Perez de Lazarraga.
"Salbatierra
"egun ey dago tristeric
"oyta dabela
"eguiten asco negarric
"çerren jarri da
"guztia destruiduric
"ez da gueratu
"barruan ese galantic
"çerca çabaloc
"jarri ey dira bacarric
"oy onezquero
"ez da mercatu bearric (...)"
After the burning, a vigorous and elegant reconstruction ensued under the hallmark of the Renaissance (late XVI-early XVII). Worth highlighting are the sumptuous walled stately homes in between the main streets, such as the "Casa de los Diezmos" in the 'Carnicería' st. While the building frenzy of the previous century waned in the 18th century, there were still some outstanding works like the pentagonal San Juan Church's baroque style porch stretching out to the centre of the marketplace.
The 19th century was to know unrest and turmoil in this area. The First Carlist War left a mayor scar on the town's medieval nucleus, since the walls were demolished in order to furnish the nearby Guevara fortress, a Carlist key position, with proper material. Between both Carlist Wars the railway was established up to the French border; however, the stretch between Vitoria-Gasteiz and Olazagutia was ready by 1862, so Agurain had already a railway stop at that time, following that the town started to expand south out of the medieval nucleus by lining both sides of the road to the station and SW of the Main Road N-1.
Crossroads.
The location of Salvatierra in the middle of a plain has been an important crossroads as early as the Neolithic age, as evidenced by the presence of two important dolmens around (see below). Scholars pinpoint the Roman manor "Alba", a milestone in the Astorga-Bordeaux Roman road (extending west to east), in the nearby village of Albeniz (some others point to Salvatierra). The way winding down the pass (cave) of San Adrian into the plains around Agurain that was to become the Way of St. James evidences prehistoric traces of seasonal cattle migration, dolmens and burial mounds in the area. It was also used by Romans and gained momentum after the seizure of Gipuzkoa and Alava by the Castilians.
The use of the Way of St. James lost ground to new and more convenient roads, like the one built through Salinas de Leniz in 1765, which proved more practical for carriages, resulting in the transfer of the traffic to the latter. The traffic gone trickle first and drain later brought about some decay to Salvatierra. Yet new communications were being built at the time: Vitoria-Gasteiz was connected to the town with a new road in 1820, and on to the corridor of Burunda. In 1862 the railway connecting Madrid and Irun arrived in the town. After having crossed the town right in the south entrance to the Medieval Nucleus for decades, currently the main road E-5 A-1 ("Nacional I") passes by the town west to east in route to France.
Language.
The main language of use in Salvatierra is currently Spanish and it has been so for at least the last 150 years. Still in 1841, there was an interpreter required by the town council for Basque speaking residents.
However, nowadays younger generations that come out of Basque-language schools (called "ikastolas") since the 1970s may speak and/or understand Basque.

Wax sculpture

A wax sculpture is a depiction made using a waxy substance. Often these are effigies, usually of a notable individual, but there are also death masks and scenes with many figures, mostly in relief.
The properties of beeswax make it an excellent medium for preparing figures and models, either by modeling or by casting in molds. It can easily be cut and shaped at room temperature, melts at a low temperature, mixes with any coloring matter, takes surface tints well, and its texture and consistency may be modified by the addition of earthy matters and oils or fats. When molten, it is highly responsive to impressions from a mold and, once it sets and hardens, its form is relatively resilient against ordinary temperature variations, even when it is cast in thin laminae. These properties have seen wax used for modelling since the Middle Ages and there is testimony for it having been used for making masks (particularly death masks) in ancient Rome. The death masks of illustrious ancestors would be displayed by the elite holding the right of "ius imaginem."
The cost of making a wax sculpture can be between USD150,000 and 300,000.
History.
Effigies.
The display of temporary or permanent effigies in wax and other media of the deceased was a common part of the funeral ceremonies of very important people in European historical times. Most of the figure would wear the real clothes of the deceased so they could be made quickly. The museum of Westminster Abbey has a collection of British royal wax effigies, as well as those of figures such as the naval hero Horatio Nelson, and Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond, who also had her parrot stuffed and displayed. The effigy of Charles II of England (1680) was displayed over his tomb until the early 19th century, when all were removed from the abbey itself. Nelson's effigy was a pure tourist attraction, commissioned the year after his death in 1805, and his burial in St Paul's Cathedral after a government decision that major public figures should in future be buried there. Concerned for their revenue from visitors, the Abbey decided it needed a rival attraction for admirers of Nelson.
Middle Ages.
The practice of wax modelling can be traced through the Middle Ages, when votive offerings of wax figures were made to churches. The memory and lineaments of monarchs and great personages were preserved by means of wax masks.
During this period, superstition found expression in the formation of wax images of hated persons, into which long pins were thrust, in the confident expectation that thereby deadly injury would be induced to the person represented. This practice was considered more effective when some portion of the victim's hair or nails were added to the wax figure, thus strengthening the connection with its actual subject. This belief and practice continued until the seventeenth century, though the superstition survived into the nineteenth century. In the Scottish Highlands, a clay model of an enemy was found in a stream in 1885, having been placed there in the belief that, as the clay was washed away, so would the health of the hated one decline.
Renaissance.
During the Italian Renaissance, modeling in wax took a position of high importance, and it was practised by some of the greatest of the early masters. The bronze medallions of Pisanello and of the other famous medalists owe their value to the properties of wax: all early bronzes and metalwork were cast from wax models first.
There are a number of very high quality wax figures from the 16th and 17th centuries, mostly portrait figures and religious or mythological scenes, often with many figures. Antonio Abondio (1538–91) pioneered the coloured wax portrait miniature in relief, working mainly for the Habsburg and other courts of Northern Europe, and his son Alessandro continued in his footsteps.
Towards the close of the 18th century, modeling of medallion portraits and of relief groups, the latter frequently polychromatic, was in considerable vogue throughout Europe. Many of the artists were women. John Flaxman executed in wax many portraits and other relief figures which Josiah Wedgwood translated into pottery for his Jasperware. The National Portrait Gallery has 40 wax portraits, mostly from this period.
The famous wax bust attributed to Leonardo da Vinci acquired in 1909 by the Museum of Berlin is the work of an English forger who worked about 1840. The wax model of a head, at the Wicar Museum at Lille, belongs probably to the school of Canova, which robs it of none of its exquisite grace.
Today.
Wax-works, not intended as fine art, subsequently became popular attractions, consisting principally of images of historical or notorious personages, made up of waxen masks on lay figures in which sometimes mechanism is fitted to give motion to the figure. Such an exhibition of wax-works with mechanical motions was shown in Germany early in the eighteenth century.
The most famous modern waxwork exhibition is that of Madame Tussaud, where the technology of robotics and audio-animatronics brings the wax figures to life.
Waxworks are frequently made presented by contemporary artists who take advantage of its lifelike and uncanny qualities. While the artist often creates a wax self-portrait, there are examples too of imaginary personalities and historical personae. For example, Gavin Turk had his portrait made as Sid Vicious ("Pop", Waxwork in vitrine 279 x 115 x 115 cm, 1993), Jan Fabre as a notorious thief (homage to Jacques Mesrine (Bust) II, 2008. Lifesize. Private collection.ta.) Contemporary artists working with wax include Beth B, Berlinde de Bruyckere, Maurizio Cattelan, Peta Coyne, Eleanor Crook, Robert Gober, John Isaacs, Wendy Mayer, Pascale Pollier, Chantal Pollier, Sigrid Sarda, and Kiki Smith. Techniques include body casting using alginate and silicone rubber moulds, and hand modelling which creates unique forms and distortions.
The museum of medieval torture instruments in Amsterdam also used wax figures in order to demonstrate the use of machines and tools of their display.
Use in moulage.
The modeling of the soft parts of dissections, teaching illustrations of anatomy, was first practised at Florence during the Renaissance. The practice of moulage, or the depiction of human anatomy and different diseases taken from directly casting from the body using (in the early period) gelatine moulds, later alginate or silicone moulds, used wax as its primary material (later to be replaced by latex and rubber). Some moulages were directly cast from the bodies of diseased subjects, others from healthy subjects to which disease features( blisters, sores, growths, rashes) were skilfully applied with wax and pigments. During the 19th century, moulage evolved into to three-dimensional, realistic representations of diseased parts of the human body. These can be seen in many European medical museums, notably the Spitzner collection currently in Brussels, the Charite Hospital museum in Berlin and the Gordon Museum of Pathology at Guy's Hospital in London UK. A comprehensive book monograph on moulages is "Diseases in Wax: the History of Medical Moulage" by Thomas Schnalke (Author) the director of the Charite Museum and Kathy Spatschek (Translator)
Wax museums.
A wax museum or waxworks consists of a collection of wax figures representing famous people from history and contemporary personalities exhibited in lifelike poses. Wax museums often have a special section dubbed the "chamber of horrors" in which the more grisly exhibits are displayed.

Sleep (Unix)

sleep is a Unix command line program that suspends program execution for a specified period of time.
The sleep instruction suspends the calling process for at least the specified number of seconds (the default), minutes, hours or days. 
Usage.
Where number is a required floating point number, and suffix is an optional suffix to indicate the time period.
Examples.
Causes the current terminal session to wait 5 seconds. The default unit is seconds.
Causes the current terminal session to wait 5 hours
Wait 3 hours then play foo.mp3
Note that sleep 5h30m and sleep 5h 30m are illegal since sleep takes only one value and unit as argument. However, sleep 5.5h is allowed. Consecutive executions of sleep can also be used.
Sleep 5 hours, then sleep another 30 minutes.
The GNU Project's implementation of sleep (part of coreutils) allows the user to pass multiple arguments, therefore sleep 5h 30m (a space separating hours and minutes is needed) will work on any system which uses GNU sleep, including GNU/Linux.
Possible uses for sleep include scheduling tasks and delaying execution to allow a process to start, or waiting until a shared network connection most likely has few users to wget a large file.

Zuia

Zuya () is a town and municipality located in the province of Álava, in the Basque Country, northern Spain.
History.
The first news we have about Zuia Valley is in the document Reja de San Millan of the year 1025 (although some authors agree that it is back, probably of the S. XII), a document that exists in the Monastery of San Millan ({La Rioja}). La Reja Monastery de San Millan is a document that every ten neighbors must deliver a grating iron to a religious institution, according to the document, nine bars correspond to Zuia , 13 to Zigoitia, 12 to Kuartango , etc...
In 1752, after repeated attempts, the King logrque grant the approval to the establishment of a highway through the valley of Zuia to facilitate the connection of Vitoria and Bilbao. All works were supposed to be completed by the year 1798. In 1763, they decide by vote that they should make a more wide town hall, where Mayor Francisco Vea Murgia. In 1767 the City Council Zuia House was finished. However, in 1795 and after 6 years of short crops and the war with France, the Valley had stayed mired in abject poverty so rhey sold half of the Town Hall, by buying it for 4300 ducats don Domingo Ortiz de Zarate, the pattern of Luquiano, who lived in Murgia.
Geography.
Geographically, it is delimiting with the province of {Bizkaia} (Orozko and Zeanuri) and {Alava} municipalities: Urkabustaiz, {Amurrio}, Zigoitia, Kuartango and {Vitoria-Gasteiz}. Within its limits, it is located a big part of the {Gorbeia} (73.5 km2),with is the most important summits: Gorbea (1,482 m), Nafakorta (1.017m) Burbona (935m) and Berretín (1.226m). Here are born some river like Baias, Ugalde and Larreakorta, which, in its flow (N-S direction), have carved steep watersheds that flow into the valley of Zuia, around river Baias.
Although part of the original vegetation of Gorbeia has been cleared, (nowadays occupied by heaths and pine), magnificent beech woods are still in Berretín (Larreakorta), Arlobi, and Ilunbe; an extensive Pyrenean in the ravine of the river Ugalde (Aldamiz, Arazo and Southeast of Berretín); and a strip of Alder groves on the banks of the Baias. But, without a doubt, the best preserved enclave is the beech forest of Altube, where the part of Zuia, has been developed around the canyons that descend from Burbona: the Bortal/Rekandi and Katxandiano.
In the area of Zuia Valley, are remain extraordinary oaks next to the Baias (in Bitoriano, Ametzaga Lukiano and Gillerna in Basubitxi and San Fausto), distributed by way of islets between large areas of pasture that occupy the entire Valley of Zuia. 
Peñas de Oro/Atxabal (896m) and Ganalto (Badaia saw, 900 m.), close the Zuia Valley, sheltering in its slopes beautiful patches of beech and oak. These places offer beautiful views over all Oro, place of great botanical interest, geological (calcareous Islet in the diapiric area of Murgia) and artistic (Sanctuary of Oro). 
Economy.
Historically, it has been a town of farming and ranching tradition. In the twentieth century appeared the first industries and today is basically becoming an area of residence. 
Just like in the rest of the region, livestock and forestry, have been economical activities by excellence in the area. Despite being a sector currently little representative, there are still important farms of sheep and cattle, some of which (Sarria) Idiazabal cheese is made. The beekeeping sector is having increasing importance, with the production of honey and derivatives, which are promoted from the Honey museum in Murgia. 
The industrial sector is located in the industrial estates of Murgia and Islarra (next to the motorway A-68), with an area of over 100,000 m2 of industrial land.
Services are, undoubtedly, the most representative sector of Zuia. The increase of tourism and the sportive activities in contact with nature, have driven this industry in a municipality with a long touristic tradition. 
Murgia has become a center of services whose sphere of influence goes far beyond municipal boundaries. This way, hosts numerous shops, bars, restaurants, hotels, sports center, technical services, tourist office, etc. 
But other villages of the Valley also host such services: farmhouses and cottages (Lukiano, Markina and Sarria), bars and restaurants (Bitoriano and Sarria), Zuia Golf Club in Altube, Service Areas in the motorway (restaurant and hotel in Altube), etc. 
Villages.

The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)

During 1955 and 1956, a condensed radio dramatisation of "The Lord of the Rings" was broadcast in twelve episodes on BBC Radio's the Third Programme. These radio broadcasts were among the first dramatisations of "The Lord of the Rings", a book by J. R. R. Tolkien, the final volume of which, "The Return of the King", had been published in October 1955. Since the BBC did not generally keep long-term archives of its productions at that time, no copies of the adaptation are known to have survived.
The first part of the story, "The Fellowship of the Ring", was broadcast in six episodes in 1955. The final two volumes, "The Two Towers" and "The Return of the King" were covered in six episodes broadcast in 1956. Both series of broadcasts were adapted and produced by Terence Tiller, who corresponded with Tolkien for advice concerning the second series.
Radio was the dominant broadcast medium in the United Kingdom at the time, and the broadcasts helped to publicise the books. The broadcasts were discussed on the BBC programme "The Critics", 
and discussion of the broadcasts brought them to the attention of a Mr Sam Gamgee, who subsequently wrote to Tolkien to ask about the origin of the name of the character Sam Gamgee.
The cast included the actor Norman Shelley, who played the parts of Gandalf and Tom Bombadil. The author's opinion on these broadcasts was revealed in several letters he wrote, which were published in 1981 in "The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien".
Quotes from J. R. R. Tolkien.
"I think the book quite unsuitable for 'dramatization', and have not enjoyed the broadcasts - though they have improved. I thought Tom Bombadil dreadful - but worse still was the announcer's preliminary remarks that Goldberry was his daughter (!), and that Willowman was an ally of Mordor (!!)." ("The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien", Letter 175, 30 November 1955)
"I think poorly of the broadcast adaptations. Except for a few details I think they are not well done, even granted the script and the legitimacy of the enterprise (which I do not grant). But they took some trouble with the names. I thought that the dwarf (Glóin not Gimli [...]) was not too bad, if a bit exaggerated." ("The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien", Letter 176, 8 December 1955)
Terence Tiller, concerning accents: "I paid great attention to such linguistic differentiation as was possible: in diction, idiom and so on; and I doubt if much more can be imported, except in so far as the individual actor represents his feeling for the character in tone and style." ("The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien", Letter 193, 2 November 1956)
Terence Tiller, concerning scripts for three of the episodes: "Here is a book very unsuitable for dramatic or semi-dramatic representation. If that is attempted, it needs more space, a lot of space. [...] Personally, I think it requires rather the older art of the reading 'mime', than the more nearly dramatic, which results in too great an emphasis on dialogue (mostly with its setting removed). [...] I feel you have had a very hard task." ("The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien", Letter 194, 6 November 1956)
to his publisher concerning an enquiry about the possibility of making a cartoon of "The Lord of the Rings": "I think I should find vulgarization less painful than the sillification achieved by the B.B.C." ("The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien", Letter 198, 19 June 1957)

Gabii

Gabii was an ancient city of Latium, located due east of Rome along the Via Praenestina, which was in early times known as the "Via Gabina".
Historical geography.
To what degree the lake was sedimented in ancient times remains unknown. Some of the earliest huts are down in the crater. Two streams flowing north to south flanked the lake on the west: the "Fosso del'Osa", and the east: "Fosso di San Giuliano". These originated in another body of water, believed to be "Lacus Regillus", on the south side of the road. The streams cut the road on either side of Gabii and were crossed by bridges; in other words, Gabii was constructed at a defensible location on an isthmus between two lakes. The isthmus was isolated by streams on either side. The quadrangle so formed contained its own water supply and straddled a major route on the east flank of Rome. It could not, as history demonstrated, be ignored by Rome. The two streams flow north to the Anio river, which flows west into the Tiber river on the north side of Rome.
In 1846 Gell reported that the Osa came from "a large marshy plain, extending almost to the Via Labicana." Passing by Lake Gabino it was connected to the latter by "artificial canals", which were in the process of draining the lake:The water of the lake has been very much lowered by this canal, and more draining is yet in contemplation, although there are already many square miles of uncultivated ground in the vicinity.
The draining of the lake was a project of the Borghese family, which had purchased it in 1614 from the Colonna family. Blewitt's handbook was able to report in 1850 (only four years later): The lake was drained a few years ago by prince Borghese, who has converted it from the state of a pestilential marsh into a district of great fertility.
Near the river a small inn had been placed, the Osteria dell'Osa ("Inn of the Osa"), north of which was the main necropolis of Gabii. The habitation today has expanded into the center of a "frazione".
The marshy plain was the last trace of the quasi-legendary lake near which the Battle of Lake Regillus decided whether the Roman Republic would continue or the kings of Rome would be restored by the intervention of the Latin League, to which Gabii belonged. The site of the battle is still a matter of dispute, which, on the unwarranted assumption that the location of the battle reveals the location of the lake, has extended into a dispute over the location of the lake. To modern topographers the deep lake basin, now kept dry, and the aqueducts that drew water, and still draw water, from its sources leave no doubt that the lake was located in the basin.
Lake Regillus varied in size and depth over the centuries but was certainly between the "Via Labicana" and the "Via Praenestina" east of Finocchio and north of Colonna (ancient Labicum), the last remnant at Pantana Borghese having been drained by the Borghese family in conjunction with the restitution of the first part of the Acqua Alexandrina as the Acqua Felice under Pope Sixtus V in the years 1585-1587. The two roads joined on the outskirts of Rome. The Pantana was the low point; from springs on its hillside exuded the water that filled the lake. During the thousand years of the post-classical period a much smaller Rome (totally abandoned at one point under the Goths) had lived on a greatly reduced water supply due to the broken and unrepaired aqueducts.
Gabii had kept its lake until the completion of the Acqua Alexandrina in 226 AD. The Romans captured springs or mountain streams for drinking water; they never fed the waters of the marsh into the aqueduct. It led from springs over the Pantana through underground conduits on the south side of the "Via Praenestina" to the outskirts of Rome, where it was carried on arched conduits above ground into the city. The Acqua Felice had more altitude at this point. By 226 the lake must have receded enough to have left a corridor along the road, as the Romans would not have been able to sink a conduit under the swamp. Having its source water drained away, the lake receded drastically. The aqueduct is still in use. In 1915 it shunted some per day into the city of Rome. If these sources were not diverted, Lake Regillus would soon return.
Meanwhile the basin marks the location of the former lake. It is now entirely agricultural land, except that the community of Lago Regillo has been placed in it near Gabii. Osteria del Finocchio marks the western limit, as it is heavily settled and is on higher ground. Lake Regillus therefore cannot have been in the vicinity of Frascati, regardless of where the battle was fought.
Prehistory.
Scattered surface pottery has been found from the Middle Bronze Age outside the necropolis located below Castiglione, from which nothing can be deduced concerning the settlement at Gabii. The Late Bronze Age is missing. The Final Bronze Age is represented by minimal Latial I (1000-900 BC) material around the inside of the crater on the southern side, indicating low-density settlement at the water's edge there.
Definitive settlement at Gabii is believed to have begun with Latial IIA (900-830 BC) when the cemeteries of Castiglione, some 60 tombs of only IIA, and Osteria del'Osa, over 600 tombs primarily of II and III (900-630 BC), and some of IV (730-580 BC), began. Both of these necropoli are dated entirely before the foundation of Rome and well before the classical city of Gabii. The location of the settlements producing these cemeteries was an issue of some mystery until aerial reconnaissance revealed a string of six "Iron Age hamlets" on the isthmus and more along the ridge to the east. Latial IIA is regarded as pre-urban and IIB as proto-urban; that is, at some time during 830-730 BC the settlements acquired a common geopolitical identity. By the end of IV (580 BC) the name Gabii must have been in place as the name of the city, as by then the history was well into the events of its legends.
The most archaeological work has been done on the cemetery of Osteria dell'Osa. The tombs are divided into 14 groups, each exhibiting a set of distinctive traditions and each believed to represent one community of roughly 100 persons, round numbers. The earliest two, contemporaneous and dated to IIA, termed the northern and southern groups from their location within the cemetery, evidence the presence of a male warrior class. At the center of the cluster is a small set of male-only cremation burials, some in hut-urns. Around them is a greater group of inhumations of men, women and children. The richer cremation burials included grave gifts of miniaturized bronze tools and weapons and miniaturized pottery forms. The inhumations lacked weapons. Women were buried with jewelry and spindle-whorls (used in weaving).
The northern group (25 tombs) covered the mouth of the burial jar (dolium) with a travertine slab, made ovicaprine food offerings, left serpentine fibulae, razors of quadrangular shape and spearheads with sockets for wooden handles. The pottery is decorated. The southern group (30 tombs) used an impasto lid on the burial jars, left serpent-fibulae of a different-style, a razor of lunate shape and one-piece cast spears. The pottery is undecorated.
Urbanization of the area probably did not begin before the start of the second half of the 8th century BC. This process most likely finished by the end of the 7th century BC, and, at its height, the city's borders enclosed .
Legend and legendary history.
The early date of the prehistoric Gabii suggests that the Roman writers could have little traditional memory of its foundation or of who founded it. The surviving traditions are therefore in the legend category; there may or may not be elements of truth in them. The tradition is two-fold: Gabii was founded either by the Latin kings of Alba Longa (according to Vergil and Dionysius of Halicarnassus) and therefore was aboriginal Latin in ethnic descent, or by the Sicels as the Siculi, a substrate population of east Italy expelled by the Italics to Sicily. They became one of the three major indigenous tribes of ancient Sicily, giving their name to it.
The legend of a Siculian foundation of Rome comes from fragments of early Roman annalists, who asserted that the Siculi occupied several cities of Latium before the arrival of the "aborigines" (Latins): Rome, Tibur, Fescennium, Falerii, Antemnae, Caenina and a few others. Gabii is mentioned as one of them by Gaius Julius Solinus. According to him two Siculian brothers founded it and named it by combining their names, "Galatus" and "Bins". Fanciful etymologies such as the above are not taken seriously but there is a sober case for a Sicilian and Siculian influence on early Latium. For example, the Cloelii claimed to be from Alba Longa and used the cognomen "Siculus". Prisons called "lautumia" were cut into the sides of the early Capitoline Hill. Syracuse used quarries, called "latomiai", for a simuilar purpose. Most of the similarities can be attributed to an influence on early Rome from Greek Sicily; however, the case of a Sicul substrate also is possible.
Plutarch relates the legend that Romulus and Remus were raised by Faustulus, the servant of Amulius, in Gabii, where they learned everything from literature to the use of Greek weapons. From there they went on to found Rome.
War with Rome under Tarquinius Superbus.
The Latin League ("Latini") was brought under Roman jurisdiction by the last king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. Addressing their council and claiming that, because all the Latin cities were founded from Alba Longa and Tullus Hostilius had made a treaty by which Alba was ceded to Rome along with all its colonies, Rome had a legal claim over the Latins, he offered them protection from any chance devastation that should inflict their country and a share in Roman prosperity if they would resume the treaty, which they did. Thenceforward Latin troops fought beside Roman within the Roman army.
Gabii reneged from the Latin treaty with Rome for unknown reasons. Tarquinius' son, Sextus Tarquinius, went to Gabii, pretending to be in revolt against his father and asking for assistance. He was accepted, and after successfully commanding various military expeditions, he was appointed as the leading general of the army of Gabii. As general, he commanded a number of minor but successful skirmishes against Roman forces, with the complicity of the Roman king.
He sent a message to the king asking what to do next. Receiving the messenger in the garden the king said nothing at all (for which he might have been held liable later) but strolled around lopping off the heads of the tallest poppies with a stick. Sextus took this to be a message to destroy the aristocrats of Gabii including Antistius Petro whom according to legend Sextus accused of plotting with Tarquinius Superbus Sextus' return to Rome dead or alive, thereby provoking the Gabines to stone Antistius to death. Tarquinius Superbus was able to take advantage of the ensuing confusion and bring Gabii into submission without battle.
Dionysius of Halicarnassus states that Tarquin was lenient with Gabii, and their subsequent treaty, whose original text was written on a bullock's skin and draped over a wooden shield, was said by Dionysius of Halicarnassus to be still extant in his day in the Roman temple of Sancus.
After the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, Sextus fled to Gabii but was killed by the leaders of the city in revenge for his past actions.
History under Roman control.
Gabii was an ally of Rome after 493 BC.
In the late Republican period, the city became depopulated due to the extensive use of the "lapis Gabinus" quarry, which was just under the archaic city. Cicero mentioned it in the 1st century BC as a small and insignificant place.
The Augustan poets used Gabii when demonstrating a city that had fallen from its old heights. From inscriptions we learn that from the time of Augustus or Tiberius onwards it enjoyed a municipal organization. Its baths were well known, and Hadrian, who was responsible for much of the renewed prosperity of the small towns of Latium, appears to have been a very liberal patron, building a senate-house (Curia Aelia Augusta) and an aqueduct.
After the 3rd century, Gabii practically disappears from history, though its bishops continue to be mentioned in ecclesiastical documents till the close of the 9th century.
Cultural influences.
Gabii's importance in the earliest history of Rome is also apparent elsewhere: the adoption of the "cinctus Gabinus" (a method of draping the toga that leaves both arms free) by the Romans for certain ceremonies, the unique role it played for the augurs as seen from the specific term "ager Gabinus" used by these priests (Varro, Ling. 5,33), and its presence in a Roman formula of "devotio".
Archaeology.
Temple of Juno.
The most conspicuous ruin remaining at the site of Gabii is a temple, generally attributed to Juno, which had six Ionic or Corinthian columns in the front and six on each side, excluding the back. The temple was composed of a single room ("cella"), and it was made of "lapis Gabinus", a fire-resistant rock that was found in the quarries around Gabii and that also made its way into some of the buildings of Rome itself. The temple was situated in the middle of a podium, which had a colonnade of Doric columns along the back and extending around the sides. This colonnade stood in front of rooms of unknown function, perhaps multi-functional, for such uses as temple shops. The temple was excavated and published by the Spanish School at Rome in the 1960s and 1970s.
The temple was constructed 150-100 BC. A painted inscription ("IVN") on an antefix identifies it as a temple of Juno. Around the rear of the temple (on the cliff side), which faced and towered above the road, were about 55 pits for planting trees representing a sacred grove. The site began as sacred in the 7th century BC featuring such a grove in which one tree was especially worshipped. In the 4th century BC a small shrine was constructed next to the grove around and in connection with which caches of anatomical terra cotta statuettes were found. This type of statuette modeled an organ or section of the human body and was given as a votive offering at a healing sanctuary, of which a great many have been found in Latium, in hope that divinity would turn its attention to healing the organ of the dedicator. Also found were some votive pedestals inscribed to "Fortuna." A pavement was inscribed to "Jupiter Jurarius" ("of oaths"), indicating possible state functions of the site. There were two other shrines at the location.
The subsequent temple to Juno remained in use during the empire, after the town was abandoned.
Forum.
To the east of the temple lay the supposed area of the forum, where excavations were made by Gavin Hamilton in 1792. Hamilton discovered a large cache of statues that were initially placed in the Borghese collection, although many of them subsequently were carried off to Paris by Napoleon, and still remain in the Louvre. The statues and busts are especially numerous and interesting (38 in all); besides the deities Venus, Diana, Nemesis, etc., they comprise Agrippa, Tiberius, Germanicus, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Trajan and Plotina, Hadrian and Sabina, Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus, Geta, Gordian III and others. The inscriptions relate mainly to local and municipal matters. 
Tower of Castiglione.
The citadel of Gabii is now marked by the ruins of the medieval tower of Castiglione.
Fieldwork since the 1990s.
New fieldwork has been undertaken to the east of Gabii along the lines of the ancient city wall where a sanctuary has been excavated by Marco Fabbri close to one of the city's gates. Other work at the site has been carried out by Stefano Musco, the local inspector of the Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Roma (SSBAR). These excavators, led by Marco Fabbri, reported the discovery of an Archaic building that they identified as a 'regia' in March 2010.
The Gabii Project.
In early 2007 the multi-institution Gabii Project, The Gabii Project commenced large-scale excavations in two areas of the site in June 2009. In late March 2010 the Gabii Project reported the discovery, in July 2009, of a half-ton lead encased inhumation burial that has tentatively been dated to the Roman Imperial period, likely the second or third centuries A.D. Evidence for early elite burials, in this case those of infants, also emerged in 2009, suggesting the development of social hierarchy in the eighth through sixth centuries BC. The discovery of an important but fragmentary Republican Latin inscription also came in 2009 and was published in 2011. The excavations of the Gabii Project continued in 2010 and 2011, during which time substantial portions of several ancient city blocks were brought to light. Not only is evidence for multi-period infrastructure clearly present, but the remains of urban architecture of the later first millennium BC have also become apparent. The award of a major collaborative research grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities supports the next phase of excavations from 2012 to 2015.

Domenico Gagini

Domenico Gagini (1420–1492) was a Swiss-Italian sculptor. He was the son of Pietro Gagini. The Gagini were a family of sculptors and painters working during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. First recorded in Genoa in the early 15th century, was Domenico's grandfather Beltrame Gagini, and his three sons Pietro, Giovanni and Pace.
Domenico Gagini was the first sculptor of this family to achieve international fame. Born at Bissone, in the Ticino (now part of Switzerland) he studied in Florence under Brunelleschi. Returning to Genoa in 1447 he worked on the sculpture of the dome of the church of S. Giovanni Battista. In 1457 he was recorded as working in Naples for Alfonso of Aragon. In 1463 he arrived in Palermo, Sicily where he, and later his family including Antonello and Antonio, influenced the decorative architecture of the island, in works of both decorative and figure sculpture.
One of Domenico Gagini's most notable works is the decoration of the choir in Palermo Cathedral, these consist of a combination of life size figures within relief panels, plus a large number of small free standing figures.
Gagini died in Palermo in 1492.

Ibn Duraid

Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Duraid al-Azdi, often known simply as Ibn Duraid (; 837 – 933 CE), was a famous Arab poet, lexicographer and philologist during the Abbasid era. He is best known for his early and influential dictionary of the Arabic language, "Jamhara fi 'l-lugha", which was only the second attempt in history to compose a comprehensive dictionary of the language.
Life.
Ibn Duraid was born at what was then called "Salih street" in Basra during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Al-Mu'tasim; the year is sometimes given as 838. While his immediate tribe was Azd, he preferred to identify himself as a Qahtanite, the larger confederacy of which Azd is a part. The modern-day descendants of his tribe are the Zahran tribe residing primarily in the Al Bahah Province of Saudi Arabia. Here he was trained under various teachers, but fled in 871 to Oman at the time Basra was attacked by the Zanj, under Muhallabi. Surprisingly, Ibn Duraid was also said to have been a practicing physician though no works on medical science have survived.
After living twelve years in Oman he went to Persia, then under the protection of the governor Abd-Allah Mikali and his sons, and wrote his chief works. Abd-Allah also hired Ibn Duraid as the director of the government office for Fars Province, though the latter donated the entirety of his salary to poor people each time it was paid, keeping almost nothing for himself while in Persia. In 920 he went to Baghdad, where he received a pension of fifty dinars a month from the caliph Al-Muqtadir in support of his literary activities which continued to his death. While in Baghdad, Ibn Duraid was a personal acquaintance of Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari.
Illness and death.
By the time he was ninety years old, he was stricken with paralysis which he reportedly cured with theriac. A year later the palsy returned, such that Ibn Duraid could only move his hands and would cry out in pain whenever anyone entered his room, even if they didn't approach him. Some of his students attributed this to a divine punishment for Ibn Duraid's heavy alcohol consumption. He was said to have retained all his mental faculties during his final paralysis, and was frequently given to self-loathing monologues due to his previous lifestyle.
Ibn Duraid died on a Wednesday in August of 933, while in mid-sentence answering a question from one of his students. He was buried on the east bank of the Tigris River in the Abbasiya cemetery, his tomb being right next to the old arms bazaar by the main street. He died on the same day as the son of philosopher Al-Jubba'i, who was also a philosopher like his father, and some of the people of Baghdad said "philology and theology have died on this day!"
Work.
The "Maqsurah", a poem praising Abd-Allah and his son Abu'l-Abbas Ismail, has been edited by A. Haitsma (1773), E. Scheidius (1786), and N. Boyesen (1828). Various commentaries on the poem exist in manuscript (cf. C. Brockelmann, Gesch. der Arab. lit., i. 211 ff., Weimar, 1898). Another work is the "Kitab ul-Ishtiqaq" ("Etymology"), edited by F. Wüstenfeld (Göttingen, 1854); it was the first book written in opposition to the Shu'ubiyya movement to show the etymological connection of the Arabian tribal names. His famed collection of forty stories have often been remarked on and parts are even contained in larger works of later authors, though the full original work is lost. Perhaps drawing on his family's Omani roots, some of Ibn Duraid's poetry contained dinstinctly Omani themes.
The "Jamhara fi 'l-lugha" is a large dictionary written in Arabic. His original handwritten work was three volumes, with the last volume consisting mostly of an extensive index. It was later published in Hyderabad, India in four volumes between 1926 and 1930. Ibn Duraid also broke with the tradition of Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi consisting of arranging the dictionary according to the part of the throat the letters are pronounced from, instead standardizing the organization of his own dictionary based on the alphabet order of Semitic languages. Due to Ibn Duraid's efforts with the second Arabic dictionary, however, historian Al-Masudi still considered him to be the intellectual heir of al-Farahidi, the author of the first Arabic dictionary. While Ibn Duraid's dictionary does resemble al-Farahidi's, it also has a confusing and disorganized system of classification and locating desired words alphabetically is difficult.
There was a measure of controversy surrounding the dictionary. Niftawayh, a contemporary of Ibn Duraid's, alleged that the latter's dictionary was merely a plagiarized version of al-Farahidi's dictionary Kitab al-'Ayn.

St John's, Ashfield

St John the Baptist Anglican Church is an active Anglican church located between Alt and Bland Streets, Ashfield, a suburb of Sydney, Australia. Founded in 1840, on land donated by Elizabeth Underwood, the church building is the oldest authenticated surviving building in Ashfield, having been built at the time when subdivision increased the population density sufficiently to turn Ashfield into a town. It was also the first church built along the Parramatta Road which linked the early colonial towns of Sydney and Parramatta. The earliest remaining parts of the building are one of the first Sydney designs by the colonial architect Edmund Blacket, who later became renowned for his ecclesiastical architecture.
The expansive church grounds contain a cemetery dating back to 1845 that contains the remains of many notable Ashfield residents. Australia's only memorial to Australian Air Force Cadets occupies a prominent position near the entrance to the church. The St John's site has been listed on the Local Environment Plan Heritage Schedule, and the Register of the National Trust of Australia.
St John's is one of three churches, along with St Albans, Five Dock, and St Oswald's, Haberfield, which make up Christ Church Inner West, operating within the parish of Ashfield, Five Dock, and Haberfield, as part of the South Sydney Region of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney. The church has had 18 rectors, including William George Hilliard who later became the Bishop of Nelson. Andrew Katay has been rector since early 2005.
History.
St John's was the first church to be established along Parramatta Road between the colonial towns of Sydney and Parramatta (then known as Rose Hill), during a time of rapid church building when many of the oldest churches in Sydney were erected. Since 1810 the Parish of Ashfield had extended from Balmain to Strathfield, and from Enfield to the Parramatta River, and in 1840 this was formalized into an ecclesiastical district.
Early contributors.
The first portion of grounds, an area of 1 acre, 2 roods, and 36 perches (a total of 0.698 ha), was provided as a gift by the local landowner Elizabeth Underwood who was subdividing "Ashfield Park". The Bishop of Australia, William Grant Broughton added urgency by expressing his "intention of having a Place of Worship erected immediately, on the allotment of land appropriated for that purpose". Another benefactor was William Bland, a doctor and politician who had been sent to the colony having been convicted of manslaughter after pistol duel which left his opponent mortally wounded, and after whom Bland street is named. He gave a donation of £200 and land. Fellow local medical practitioner, James Bowman, contributed a "similarly munificent donation". By mid-1839 the funds received were thought to be sufficient to commence building. The exact location was determined in February 1840, and appeals continued to fund a building of sufficient size for the surrounding population.
Church building.
The church was founded on 9 September 1840. The service on that day was read by the first rector, Joseph Kidd Walpole, who had come to the district from Christ Church, Kelso, and had begun to plan the church building. W. G. Broughton made an address at the ceremony. The anniversary sermon was preached by Robert Allwood.
Building work on the church began in 1841, but construction came to a standstill due to construction problems and insufficient subscriptions. The following year the colonial architect Edmund Blacket, as one of his first assignments after arriving in Sydney, was requested to inspect the church's walls, then still under construction. As a result of his report, the walls were demolished and re-erected, although continued funding problems, and the transfer of J. K. Walpole to Windsor caused further delays. The church was licensed for operation on 1 October 1843. Much of the interior woodwork was carved by the third rector, Frederick Wilkinson. The roof was strengthened in around 1845 by the installation of timber support columns. On 16 August 1845, at a cost of £100 the church purchased an additional of land from Elizabeth Underwood (who remained a parishioner until her death, and is buried in a prominent grave within the church cemetery). The church was eventually consecrated on 19 August 1845.
After 29 years, as the Bishop of Sydney Frederic Barker put it "the population of Sydney had invaded these sylvan shades", so an expansion was required. Blacket designed the current stone transept and chancel, to transform the church into a cruciform plan. These were built during the period 1874–1875 at a cost of around £150 – raised without the help of grants from the government or the English societies. The foundation stone of the addition was laid by Barker on 24 October 1874, and included a copy of "Australian Churchman" and the "Sydney Morning Herald". At the time this addition accommodated an extra 250 seats, bringing the total capacity to 446.
Construction of the choir vestry and a wooden porch outside the western door were completed in 1885, and dedicated by Bishop Alfred Barry. This work was overseen by the Blacket brothers, who had followed the trade of their late father.
Arthur Blacket then designed the west tower. The eight-bell peal was ordered from England after a generous bequest by one of the "Melanesian boys", David Marguay, and subsequent fundraising. The tower was then quickly constructed at a cost of around £250 in memory of the recently deceased rector James Christian Corlette, and dedicated as The Corlette Memorial Tower on 1 November 1901. The memorial bells proved depressing amongst the local populace, and were rearranged in 1904, with louvres added to the previously open arches. This was apparently ineffective, as the bells were removed within a few years.
Music.
Prior to the installation of a pipe organ, a seraphine and then an harmonium were used for musical accompaniment. The first organ was installed above the gallery at the western end of the church by William Davidson at the request of the rector J. C. Corlette, and was transferred to the south transept in about 1879, where it remained until 1882 when it was sold to St Bartholomew's, Pyrmont, and later St Luke's, Northmead.
The 1883 Hill and Son organ, including 844 pipes, costing a total of £550, was installed in 1884, and located in the north-east corner of the transept. It is still in use, with original pipework, making it faithful to the original tones. The organ was refurbished and rebuilt in 1950, 1975, and 2008.
The 1950 change from mechanical to electrical action was motivated by removing the increasingly noisy pedals and trackers. This refurbishment also included detachment of the console (to the other side of the transept), and replacement of the bellows with a "pressure equaliser". The façade pipes were sprayed to a dull gold colour, covering over the original diapering, described disparagingly at the time as "all over the pipes without much rhyme or reason; fleurs-de-lys in profusion, dots, bands, triangles in all the colours of the rainbow rioted in confusion". This work was carried out by R. A. and D. A. Wiltshire.
By 1975 the organ had become unplayable, and a reconversion to mechanical action was undertaken. The console was moved back to the organ side of the transept, with the action going backward under the floor into the organ. This necessitated removal of floor joists and foundation piers, but the unsupported floor caused further problems long term, and during the 2008 rebuild it was re-electrified.
The church had a significant choral history, with significant events often celebrated with a full choir, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra. In the late 19th century the St John's choir participated in regional choir festivals.
Site development.
A small hall for Sunday school was erected in 1865 by the generosity of L. H. Smythe. By 1895 the hall had fallen into disrepair, and the needs of the children had outgrown it. The current Parish Hall was planned to replace it. The memorial stone for the replacement building was laid by the Primate of Australia, William Saumarez Smith in inclement weather on 2 February 1895. The architect was E. A. Scott, and his building design was of a "domestic style... with a highly decorated front". It cost £625 10s, was complete within three months, and seated up to 400. However, by 1903, the Sunday school had once again outgrown the space available, and an additional infants classroom was built nearby. This is now called the Small Hall, and is used as a classroom for the St John's Preschool.
A rectory was first provided for the rector J. C. Corlette and his large family in 1879. A block of land, located on what is now the corner of Rectory Avenue and Alt Street, was purchased for £444, and the foundation stone was laid by Bishop Barker in 1880. This original rectory was sold in 1922 for £1800. The current rectory, on the main grounds of the church, was founded by Archbishop John Charles Wright in the same year, during the rectorship of William George Hilliard, and built at a cost of £2500.
Gravel pathways lined with "Phoenix canariensis" palms, the lawn in front of the church, and the stone churchyard fence were also constructed in the 1920s. The Alt Street wall was erected in 1922, and dedicated to the previous rector Alfred Yarnold. The Bland Street wall was dedicated in 1927 by Archdeacon Davies, and commemorates one of the key contributors, R. A. Forsaith.
The cemetery, which had been in existence since soon after the foundation of the church (the first interment was Frederick Underwood, Elizabeth's 11-month-old grandson, on 1 May 1845), was consecrated by the Archbishop of Sydney, Howard West Kilvinton Mowll, on 8 September 1934. By this stage it reportedly already contained the remains of 1,396 people. He was asked by the rector of the time to "set apart the area, containing 4 acres and 4 perches (1.63 ha), as a burial-place for the bodies of Christian people living in and about Ashfield".
Australia's only memorial to Australian Air Force Cadets occupies a prominent position on the grounds, and a memorial service attended by the Cadets has been held annually since it was opened by the State Governor Lieutenant General John Northcott in 1946. It was built by Squadron Leader Arthur Whitehurst who had commanded a squadron at Ashfield during the period 1941–1946, and whose son Douglas Arthur Whitehurst had died in action in World War II.
A children's playground was installed near the Alt St boundary in 2011, and opened by Ashfield Municipal Council Mayor Ted Cassidy and Strathfield MP Charles Casuscelli.
Regional influence.
A number of local street names were derived from the presence of St John's. Church Street, which ends directly opposite the church entrance, was originally the track used by Burwood residents to reach the church, using a conveniently located fallen tree across Iron Cove Creek.
As the population of Sydney's Inner West grew, many of the Anglican churches in the area were established by the congregation of St John's (including four during the final thirty years of the nineteenth century). These include Balmain, Burwood, Five Dock, St Thomas' Enfield (declared a separate parish in 1868), and St Oswald's Haberfield (1908). Because of this involvement, St John's was later referred to as the "Mother Church of Western Suburbs".
Rectors.
St. John's has had eighteen rectors to date.
Joseph Kidd Walpole was the first rector, during the period 1840–1842. He was originally from England, and went on mission to Madras in 1836, but his health gave way, and he was transferred to New South Wales. He was ordained as a Deacon in 1936, and as a Priest in 1937. After disappointing progress on the building, he was transferred to Richmond after two years.
William Stone, B.A. was the rector during the period 1842–1843. He grew up in a clerical family in Ireland, married his first cousin, and had nine children, seven of whom joined their parents on the journey to Australia in 1841. When appointed at St John's, he set aside a room in their family home, deemed by the Bishop as temporarily licensed as a place of worship since the church was not yet complete. At the time he was also the minister of the Parish of Concord, and earned a government stipend of £150. He was transferred to Sutton Forest in 1843.
Frederick Wilkinson, M.A., was the rector during the period 1843–1854. He personally carved much of the woodwork in St Johns. During his rectorship, he also organized for St Mary's church to be built in Balmain, and then St Thomas' Enfield. Once St Mary's was built, he presided alternately in Ashfield and Balmain. During his time at Ashfield, the Wilkinsons lived in a "picturesque, many-gabled wooden house called The Meads in Enfield" (near Burwood road), where he had a large workshop for his wood-carving. He also established a private school at The Meads, which enjoyed a "high reputation as the best collegiate school in the colony". Apart from a return trip to England (serving as the ship's chaplain during the journeys), he continued his leadership of St John's until June 1854 when he accepted 'a special commission for the cure' at Holy Trinity at Millers Point.
Thomas Hatham/Hattam Wilkinson was the rector during the period 1854–1860. He had originally come to the colonies in the company of his father's brother, Frederick. Since then he had been curate-in-charge at Balmain under his uncle, got married to Julia Sarah Underwood (Elizabeth's daughter) at St John's, served a short period as chaplain to Darlinghurst Gaol and three years as the assistant minister of St John the Baptist, Canberra. After his uncle left St John's, he became the rector. After leaving St John's, he moved to Enfield, and later Appin, finally returning for burial in the St John's cemetery after his death in 1876.
William Lumsdaine was the newly ordained rector during the period 1860–1865. He had come to Australia with his two brothers and a sister in 1836 in the charge of Bishop Broughton. When he became rector, he rented Ashfield Park House, Elizabeth Underwood's original house as his family residence. Along with Ashfield, he simultaneously held the incumbency for the parishes of Burwood, Enfield, and Five Dock. During his time at St John's, two of his children died of diphtheria on the same day. After finishing at St John's, he continued to serve at Five Dock and Burwood. He died in 1902 aged 78 and is buried in the St John's cemetery.
William Cecil Cave-Browne-Cave was the rector during the period 1865–1867. He was a grandson of the ninth Cave-Browne-Cave Baronet. He was recently married when he arrived at St John's. Later in his career he held the rectorship at St Thomas' North Sydney.
Canon James Christian Corlette, D.D., was the rector during the period 1867–1900. His previous appointment had been in Jamberoo. He was married to Frances Edith Manning, a daughter of the politician Sir William Montagu Manning. In 1877 she was elected to the committee of the newly formed Infant's Home, as an indication of Anglican support. The home cared for abandoned babies, and was the subject of a storm of protest, with the Roman Catholic Cardinal Patrick Francis Moran accusing it of a "vindication of promiscuous practices". The Corlettes' eight children were all born during his time at St John's. Perhaps not surprisingly, during this period St John's first began to provide a residence for the rector. Corlette encouraged Ashfield's Melanesian population to worship at St John's, and many later returned to the islands as missionaries. He provided more frequent and regular services than his predecessor, and emphasized Saint's Days, Communion and music. During the period 1868–1884 he concurrently held the precentorship at St Andrew's Cathedral, and in 1897 again served there as canon. In 1893 he was chaplain to the Bishop of Sydney, and became rural dean of Petersham in 1895. Along with many of his family, he is buried in the St John's cemetery.
Alfred Yarnold was the rector during the period 1901–1916, which were the final fifteen years of his career. Immediately previously he had spent nineteen years as the rector of Christ Church, Lavender Bay. Overlapping with his time at St John's, he was also the chaplain to the Archbishop of Sydney, and the rural dean of Petersham.
William George Hilliard, M.A., was the rector during the period 1916–1926. He was recently ordained when he joined St John's, having completed only a four-year curacy at Dulwich Hill. His first wife died during his time at St John's. When he completed his time at St John's, he became the Headmaster of a local private school, Trinity Grammar School. In 1934 he became the Bishop of Nelson. He was described as "one of the most popular evangelicals in the Church life of Australia, and a forceful preacher".
Ainslie Arthur Yeates, M.A., was the rector during the period 1927–1928. He came to Ashfield from St John's Woolwich. Soon after he arrived he suffered a breakdown in his health, was very sick throughout his time at Ashfield, and died after a four-year incumbency.
Herbert Stanley Cocks, B.A. Th.L., was the rector during the period 1931–1939. He brought with him a wide experience of church work. Having been ordained just before World War I he had been a chaplain for the A.I.F., and after demobilization a missionary, school principal, and chaplain in India. Most recently he had been rector of Holy Trinity, Erskineville.
Leonard Neville Sutton, M.A., was the rector during the period 1939–1949. He was a keen teacher, having previously been principal at St Andrew's Cathedral School, chaplain at The King's School, and vice-principal at Brighton Grammar School. He was very interested in the welfare of young people. This enthusiasm led him to start the St John's Preschool. The Sunday School also had 350 pupils at the time.
Frederick Allen Seymour Shaw, B.A. Th.L., was the rector during the period 1949–1966. He had already served as an assistant clergyman at St John's during 1930–1931. During that time, he was ordained. Eighteen years later he returned to St John's as the rector.
John R. Seddon, Th.L. Dip.R.E., was the rector from 1966 until he transferred to St Luke's Mosman in 1973.
Percy William "Bill" George Twine, Th.L. L.T.C.L., was the rector during the period 1973–1980. He had long been an organ player, and inclined toward high church style. He died suddenly whilst still the rector.
Stanford Ronald Colefax, R.F.D. Dip.Th., was the rector during the period 1980–1990.
Dennis P. Robinson, Th.L. was the rector during the period 1990–2003.
Andrew Katay, B.D. M.Th., became the rector in early 2005. He was previously a Senior Associate Minister at St. Barnabas, Broadway, and Anglican chaplain at The University of Sydney, while leading the staff team of the Sydney University Evangelical Union. His arrival at the church marked a change from two traditional communion services to congregations with a variety of styles.
Acting rectors.
From time to time, an acting rector or locum tenens has taken on temporary leadership, or filled a gap between rectors.
Septimus Hungerford was acting rector in 1879. He had previously been the rector of St Peter's Cathedral, Armidale. Later he became the incumbent at St Thomas' Enfield.
William Hough took temporary leadership in 1889 whilst J. C. Corlette undertook the precentorship of Goulburn Cathedral.
Arthur Christian Corlette stood in temporarily for his older brother J. C. Corlette in 1898.
Robert William Phayre Montgomery filled in at St John's after the death of J. C. Corlette, during the period 1900–1901. He was an Irishman who came to Australia as a missionary chaplain in 1891. After leaving St John's he took up a position as vicar of Cressy
Arthur Killworth M.A. LL.B., acted as rector during the period 1928–1931.
Archdeacon William Apedaile Charlton led St John's for four months in 1939 after the departure of H. S. Cocks. He had already served in Sydney churches for 55 years.
James R. Le Huray, Th.L. was the acting rector during the period 2004–2005.
Education.
In the mid-1850s St John's established a Church of England Denominational Day School in a small, plain white stone building near the corner of Charlotte and Bland St, which was reported as being in good repair with 28 pupils in 1867. However, when the Ashfield public school expanded in 1875, the church school proved unable to compete, and by 1880 it was closed. The building was sold to the newly begun Ashfield Boy's College in 1882, but was demolished in 1885.
Catholic education in the area flourished, and seeing this, J. C. Corlette wrote to England to Miss Ellen Clarke, suggesting that she start a school for young ladies in Ashfield. This went ahead, the school known as Normanhurst School began in a cottage in Bland Street. Although it was officially non-denominational, Normanhurst maintained strong links with St John's. The school grew, and moved premises to Orpington Street, but eventually closed down in 1941.
Land and buildings.
Church.
Having evolved over a long period, the church building displays elements of a range of styles including Colonial Gothick Picturesque, Victorian and Federation Free Gothic. The transepts and chancel are constructed from Sydney sandstone, whereas the nave and tower are rendered brick. The roofs are all slate.
The interior has been described as "architecturally much more satisfying than its exterior". It has a hammerbeam ceiling with a curved rafter roof with colonettes, plaster walls, and stained glass in every window from a range of periods. The reredos and pulpit are distinctive cedar carvings by the early rector F. Wilkinson.
Cemetery.
The cemetery is geographically aligned with the church, and takes up a large portion of the land area. The oldest graves are on the eastern side of the path, and typically face west. Newer graves on the western side of the path generally face east.
A number of notable former Ashfield residents are buried at St John's. First Fleet convict, John Limeburner/Linburner, had been transported for stealing clothing to the value of about one pound, eventually died in 1847 aged 104. His headstone was defaced by vandals in 1965. Several members of the Wilkinson and Underwood families were significant in the early European settlement of the Ashfield district. Louise Taplin (1855–1901) was matron of The Infants Home in Ashfield for 15 years until her death, and led the home through the 1890s depression, despite a shortage of salaried staff. Henry Halloran (1811–1893) was a poet and resident of Ashfield, and was married to Elizabeth Underwood's daughter Elizabeth. Thomas Walker, a banker and philanthropist who owned and developed Yaralla Estate, is in a family grave with his wife Jane, and daughter Eadith's ashes. Samuel Henry Terry, a wealthy landowner and politician is also buried at St Johns, having spent the last part of his life in an Ashfield residence named "The Lilacs". Randolph John Want was a solicitor and member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. Edward Thomas Jones Wrench was one of the founding partners of real estate agents Richardson and Wrench. Amy Schauer was a cookery instructor and author. The graveyard also contains members of the Taverner, Uhr and Rodd families, after whom the localities Taverner's Hill, Uhr's Point, and Rodd Point are named. There are also graves of three former rectors: T. H. Wilkinson, W. Lumsdaine, and J. C. Corlette, and members of their families, together with a pioneer clergyman, E. Rogers.
Beside these prominent figures, many of the St John's graves contain children. Typhoid and whooping cough epidemics took heavy tolls in the Victorian period. Although Ashfield was known as a healthy area, many families lost two or even three children.
Burial rates at St John's declined rapidly around the turn of the 20th century. The rector's notes from the time indicate that many funeral services conducted at the church now preceded burial at Rookwood Cemetery. Although the cemetery has never officially been closed, no burial plots have been sold for some years. A memorial garden for the interment of ashes was opened in the time of J. R. Seddon, providing a popular resting place for the Ashfield community.
Since the late 1970s day-release prisoners have assisted with maintenance of the cemetery grounds. In Australia's bicentennial year, 1988, a $16,000 grant was awarded for restoration work in the cemetery, at which time some broken gravestones were cemented together, and some illegible ones were 'cut back' and the letters repainted.
Ministry.
Andrew Katay became the 18th rector in early 2005. In 2008 the church was part of an amalgamation with the parish of Five Dock and Haberfield, forming Christ Church Inner West Anglican Community (CCIW) with Andrew Katay continuing as the rector of the new parish. There are currently three Sunday services at Ashfield, and two at Five Dock.
Since July 2006 it has run a mothers and children group, which discusses Christian parenting issues, and teaches English to those for whom it is not their native language.
In 2010 the church began an outdoor film festival showing ghost and horror movies in the historic cemetery.

Nadezhda Tylik

Nadezhda Tylik is a Russian citizen who was filmed publicly accusing President President Putin and Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov of lying to relatives of crew members of the submarine "Kursk" which had sunk in a disaster only 10 days before. Her son Lt. Sergei Tylik was among those who died. When she would not be quiet, she was forcibly sedated and removed from the meeting. The entire event was televised and seen by an international audience, though it was not broadcast inside Russia. 
Putin meets family members.
On Tuesday, 22 August, Putin met at 20:00 in the Vidyayevo navy base officers club and cultural centre for three to six hours with about 400-600 angry and grief-filled family members of the "Kursk"s crew. The meeting was closed and access was tightly controlled. Two Russian journalists from "Nezavisimaya Gazeta" and "Kommersant", who posed as family members, witnessed hysterical widows and mothers howling at Putin, demanding to know why they were receiving so much conflicting information and who was going to be punished for the deaths of their family members. 
Confronts Russian officials.
During the meeting, Tylik was extremely emotional and interrupted the meeting. She harangued Deputy Prime Minister Klebanov and Putin. She accused them of lying to her and other family members about the Kursk disaster.
Forcibly sedated.
When she would not be quiet, a woman in civilian clothing behind her forcibly injected her through her clothes with a sedative. She shortly thereafter lost the ability to speak and was carried out. The whole scene was captured by a TV crew, although it was not televised within Russia. The rest of the world was able to see officials remove her from the meeting.
Family statements.
Immediately after his wife was given the injection, Tylik's husband said he had asked the woman to give his wife the drug "because she was prone to excessive emotions." Four months later she revealed that her husband had lied about the injection to the public to "save my nerves" and that he, in fact, "did not ask for help." "The injection was done to shut my mouth. Immediately after it I just lost the ability to speak and was carried out."
As of February 23, 2001, at least 15 surviving family members have filed complaints with the Prosecutor General's Office seeking more information about the sinking of the ship. Tylik told the St. Petersburg Times that she will go to any lengths to learn the truth about the submarine disaster "They told us lies the whole time, and even now we are unable to get any information," she said.
The sedation concerned people in Russia as well as the West that the former Soviet Union was returning to its Cold War-era methods of silencing dissent. Tylik said that her had told her six days before the disaster that the submarine had " 'death onboard,' but he didn't explain what he meant." "I am sure that the commanders of the Northern Fleet knew that the torpedoes were not in order. Those who are guilty must be punished.
Government response.
Navy officials in Vidyayevo later confirmed to "The Times" and to "The St. Petersburg Times" that she was given a sedative. "We've been giving sedatives to relatives since this began, and it is not such a big deal as you make it out to be in the West," said an officer who would not identify himself. "We are simply protecting the relatives from undue pain - it was for her own protection."

Frank C. Whitmore

Frank Clifford Whitmore (1887–1947), nicknamed "Rocky", was a prominent chemist who submitted significant evidence for the existence of carbocation mechanisms in organic chemistry.
He was born in 1887 in the town of North Attleborough, Massachusetts.
Academic career.
Whitmore earned both his bachelor's degree (1911) and Ph.D. (1914) from Harvard University, where his Ph.D. advisor was Charles Loring Jackson. Several prominent contemporaries of Whitmore at Harvard were E.K. Bolton, Farrington Daniels, Roger Adams, James B. Sumner and James Bryant Conant. After graduating from Harvard he became a professor and taught at the University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and The Pennsylvania State University. 
At Penn State, Whitmore served as the Dean of the School of Chemistry and Physics from 1929–1947, succeeding his former Harvard colleague Gerald Wendt in the position. He hired several prominent scientists as faculty members, including Russell Marker and Merrell Fenske. 
Research and publications.
While at the Pennsylvania State University Whitmore did his research on carbocations. The field of organic chemistry was struggling to explain how a compound with a double bonded carbon, an alkene, reacts with a halide compound. Whitmore worked on the findings of others and generalized the concept of molecules with a positively charged carbon atom, a carbocation, as an intermediate step in the addition of a halogen element.
Whitmore would go on to publish his findings in a paper titled "The Common Basis of Intramolecular Rearrangements." They were controversial at the time because many chemists, notably well known chemist Roger Adams, a critic of Whitmore's, believed that a molecule like a carbocation would never be stable enough to exist. Nevertheless, Whitmore published these findings which today are accepted as the most logical explanation for the reactions in question. 
In 1937, Whitmore published "Organic Chemistry", the first advanced organic chemistry textbook to be written in English. Whitmore worked on a revision of the book for several years, though the work was interrupted by World War II. The second edition of "Organic Chemistry" was published posthumously in 1951.
American Chemical Society.
Whitmore was very active in the American Chemical Society (ACS), holding several different offices in the organization throughout his life. In 1938, he served as president of ACS. During his presidency, he visited 72 of 104 local ACS sections. In 1937, Whitmore won the prized William H. Nichols Medal, awarded by the New York section of ACS. In 1945, Whitmore was awarded the Willard Gibbs Medal (considered to be the highest chemical honor in America) by the Chicago section of ACS.
Whitmore rarely slept. It was not rare for him work twenty hours a day, and take one hour naps when he was tired.
Family.
Whitmore married Marion Gertrude Mason (who graduated from Radcliffe College with a degree in chemistry in 1912) in 1914. The Whitmores had four children: Frank Jr., Mason, Harry, and Marion, Jr ("Marionette"). Frank Whitmore died in 1947 at the age of 59 as the result of a heart ailment (likely related to his high blood pressure). Penn State's Whitmore Laboratory is named after Whitmore.

Australian Hymn Book

The Australian Hymn Book (ISBN 1-86371-150-3) was published in 1977, and was the culmination of almost ten year's work by an ecumenical committee, chaired by A. Harold Wood, intent on producing a new, contemporary and inclusive hymn book that could be used in worship by the varied Christian congregations across Australia. The first meetings were held in 1968 amongst representatives of the Anglican (Church of England), Congregational, Methodist and Presbyterian churches. A draft list of hymns was circulated in 1972, and in 1974, the Roman Catholic Church asked to be included and two versions of the hymn book were eventually published: the "Australian Hymn Book" (containing 579 items) and the "Australian Hymn Book with Catholic Supplement" (adding a further 25 items). The new hymn book was taken up widely, especially with the union of the Congregational, Methodist and most of the Presbyterian parishes that created the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977. In its international edition, the hymn book is known as "With One Voice" (not to be confused with the 1995 work published by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America as a supplement to the "Lutheran Book of Worship").
The hymn book contains indexes to first lines, tunes, composers, authors, subjects, scripture and the religious calendar. A companion book, "Songs of the People of God", by Wesley Milgate, was released in 1982, and contains notes on the sources and history of each tune and hymn text, along with short biographies of all authors and composers.
After a survey conducted in 1990, it was decided that a new edition of the "Australian Hymn Book" was needed. Together in Song: Australian Hymn Book II was released in 1999. The major changes were the modernisation of the texts (particularly the use of inclusive language), the removal of hymns that had fallen out of use, and the addition of more modern musical settings, worship songs and psalm settings. A companion volume with notes on songs, lyrists and composers compiled by Rev. Dr. H. D'Arcy Wood is also available.

El nervio del volcán

El Nervio del Volcán (The Nerve of the Volcano) is an album released by Mexican Rock en español band Caifanes in July 1994. 
With bassist Sabo Romo and keyboardist Diego Herrera out of the band since 1993, Saúl Hernández (voice), Alfonso André (drums), and Alejandro Marcóvich (guitars) were the remaining band members left to record Caifanes' fourth studio album in Los Angeles, California between the months of February and April 1994. The album included the hit single "Afuera."
This is the last album by Caifanes. In 1995 Hernández formed a new incarnation of his previous band, Jaguares, due to legal disputes and fallout with lead guitar Alejandro Marcóvich.
Guest artists included Graham Nash, Stuart Hamm, Federico Fong,Yann Zaragoza and Cecilia Toussaint.

Mario di Calasio

Mario di Calasio (1550 in Calasion, Abruzzi, Italy – February 1, 1620 in Ara Coeli) was an Italian Minorite friar.
Biography.
Joining the Franciscans at an early age, he devoted himself to Oriental languages and became an authority on Hebrew. Once entering Rome he was appointed by Paul V, whose confessor he was to the chair of Scripture at Ara Coeli. Calasio is known by his "Concordantiae sacrorum Bibliorum hebraicorum", published in 4 vols. (Rome, 1622), two years after his death, a work which is based on Nathan's "Hebrew Concordance" (Venice, 1523).
Works.
For forty years Calasio labored on this work, and he secured the assistance of the greatest scholars of his age. The Concordance evinces great care and accuracy. All root-words are treated in alphabetical order and the whole Bible has been collated for every passage containing the word, so as to explain the original idea, which is illustrated from the cognate usages of the Chaldee, Syrian, Rabbinical Hebrew and Arabic. Calasio gives under each Hebrew word the literal Latin translation, and notes any existing differences from the Vulgate and Septuagint readings. An incomplete English translation of the work was published in London by Romaine in 1747. Calasio also wrote a Hebrew grammar, "Canones generales linguae sanctatae" (Rome, 1616), and the "Dictionarium hebraicum" (Rome, 1617).

Osorkon III

Usermaatre Setepenamun Osorkon III Si-Ese was Pharaoh of Egypt in the 8th Century BC. He is the same person as the Crown Prince and High Priest of Amun Osorkon B, son of Takelot II by his Great Royal Wife Karomama II. Prince Osorkon B is best attested by his "Chronicle"—which consists of a series of texts documenting his activities at Thebes—on the Bubastite Portal at Karnak. He later reigned as king Osorkon III in Upper Egypt for twenty-eight years after defeating the rival forces of Pedubast I/Shoshenq VI who had apparently resisted the authority of his father here. Osorkon ruled the last five years of his reign in coregency with his son, Takelot III, according to Karnak Nile Level Text No. 13. Osorkon III's formal titulary was long and elaborate: Usermaatre Setepenamun, Osorkon Si-Ese Meryamun, Netjer-Heqa-waset.
Accession.
Osorkon III's precise accession date is unknown. Various Egyptologists have suggested it may have been from around the mid-790s BC to as late as 787 BC. The issue is complicated by the fact that Prince Osorkon B did not immediately declare himself king after his successful conquest of Thebes and defeat of Shoshenq VI. This is evidenced by the fact that he dated this seminal event to Year 39 of Shoshenq III rather than Year 1 of his reign. Osorkon III may, therefore, have waited for a minimum of one or two years before proclaiming himself as a Pharaoh of the Theban-based 23rd Dynasty. Osorkon may also have been motivated to defeat or pacify any remaining supporters of the Pedubast I/Shoshenq VI rival faction in other regions of Upper Egypt whether they were in Elephantine, the Western Desert Oasis region—where Pedubast I is monumentally attested—or elsewhere in order to consolidate his position. Hence, Year 1 of Osorkon III is likely equivalent to Year 1 or Year 2 of Shoshenq IV instead, rather than Year 39 of Shoshenq III.
Identity.
Osorkon III is attested by numerous impressive donation stelae and stone blocks from Herakleopolis Magna through to Thebes. He is generally thought to have been a contemporary of the Lower Egyptian 22nd Dynasty kings, Shoshenq IV, Pami, and the first decade of Shoshenq V's reign. Osorkon III's chief wife was Queen Karoadjet but his second wife was named Tentsai. A stela of Prince Osorkon B calls his spouse Tent[...] with part of the name being lost. The latter name can be rendered as either Tentsai or Tentamun. Significantly, however, both men have a daughter called Shepenupet.
Secondly, according to Ōhshiro Michinori, Anthony Leahy, and Karl Jansen-Winkeln, an important donation stela discovered in 1982 at (ancient Akoris) reveals that Osorkon III was once a High Priest of Amun in his own right. The document explicitly calls Osorkon III, the High Priest of Amun. Osorkon III, thus, was almost certainly the High Priest Osorkon B, who defeated his father's opponents at Thebes in Year 39 of Shoshenq III, as Leahy notes. This theory has been accepted by many Egyptologists today, including Jürgen von Beckerath, Karl Jansen-Winkeln, Gerard Broekman, and Aidan Dodson, among others, with the notable exception of Kenneth Kitchen. Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton sum up the evidence by noting:
Osorkon probably lived into his eighties, which explains why he appointed his son Takelot III as the junior coregent to the throne in his final years. He would have been in failing health by this time. Osorkon III's coregency with Takelot III is the last attested royal coregency in ancient Egyptian history. Later dynasties from Nubia, Sais, and Persia all ruled Egypt with a single king on the throne.
Karnak Nile Level Texts No. 6 and 7, dated to Year 5 and 6 of Osorkon III, calls his mother the "Chief Queen Kamama Merymut." Similarly, Prince Osorkon B's mother was identified as Queen Ka<ra>mama Merymut II, wife of Takelot II. The slightly different renderings of this Queen's name almost certainly refers to the same person here: Osorkon B/III.
Consorts.
According to Kenneth Kitchen, Osorkon III's chief consort, Queen Karoadjet, was the mother of Shepenupet I, the God's Wife and Divine Adoratrice of Amun, while his lesser wife Tentsai was the mother of Osorkon III's two sons: Takelot III and Rudamun. Shepenupet I outlived both her half-brothers as the serving God's Wife of Amun at Thebes and survived into the reign of the Nubian ruler, Shebitku, where she is depicted on the small temple Osiris-Heqa-djet in the Amun precinct of Karnak, which was partially decorated by this king.

Parks and open spaces in Ealing

__NOTOC__
The London Borough of Ealing, one of the Outer London boroughs although not on the periphery, has over 100 parks and open spaces within its boundaries. These include allotments, cemeteries, playgrounds, and golf courses in addition to the larger open spaces such as nature conservation areas. The main areas are:
The Brent River Park is one of 11 parks throughout Greater London chosen to receive money for redevelopment by a public vote in 2009. The park received £400,000 towards better footpaths, more lighting, refurbished public toilets and new play areas for children.
Allotments.
Across the London Borough of Ealing there are 63 allotments sites. Most are council owned but a few are independent.
The allotments in this part of London dramatically increased during WWII as part of the government effort to feed the nation. To encouraged the uptake of an allotment plots by people of whom had no access to a garden themselves, a campaign was waged under the slogan “Dig for Victory”. Towards the later end of the 20th century they became popular again amongst the growing ethic communities, as a source of some of their more familiar and traditional vegetables which were otherwise unobtainable in British shops. Some local organisations have now formally recognised some of the benefits that come from working on allotments and actively encourage their use.
Ealing Council has also signed up to the Unitary Development Plan which it is hoped will safeguard the existing allotments from building developers.
Notes.
a. This park is named after the French aerialist Charles Blondin
(who was first to cross the Niagara Falls on a tightrope). He once lived in a house on Northfield Avenue, Little Ealing and the park covers what was formerly the western part of its large grounds.
b. 
The Brent River Park is not only a public amenity but forms an important part of the borough’s Green Corridors with which to aid nature conservation. Also, by prohibiting development on what is much of the river Brent’s natural flood plain, it provides some measure of flood control.

Louis Gallait

Louis Gallait (9 or 10 May 1810 – 20 November 1887) was a Belgian painter he lay at the basis of a revival of history painting in Belgium. He earned his reputation especially with the large painting of Charles V's abdication. Gallait's works were esteemed because of their realism, faithfulness of the costumes and color composition of his paintings. He was also a distinguished portrait painter.
Gallait died in Brussels in 1887. There is a painting by Louis Gallait at the Norton Art Museum in West Palm Beach, Florida ("Art and Liberty").
Biography.
Gallait was born in Tournai, Hainaut, Belgium in 1810. He first studied in his native town under Philippe Auguste Hennequin. In 1832 his first picture, "Tribute to Caesar", won a prize at the Salon of Ghent. He then went to Antwerp to continue his studies under Mathieu Ignace van Brée, and in the following year exhibited at the Brussels Salon "Christ Healing the Blind". This picture was purchased by subscription and placed in the Tournai Cathedral. Gallait next went to Paris, and he sent to the Belgian Salons "Job on the Dunghill", "Montaigne Visiting Tasso in Prison", and — to the Brussels Gallery in 1841 — "The Abdication of Charles V". The latter painting, which had been commissioned by the Belgian government, was hailed as a triumph and gained him a European reputation. The painting was exhibited together with a painting entitled the "Compromise of Nobles" by another young Belgian painter, Edouard de Bièfve. Both paintings subsequently travelled to exhibitions in many cities in Europe, and enjoyed a particularly enthusiast reception in Germany where they formed an important impetus for the development of a German school of history painting. Official invitations induced him to settle at Brussels.
Among his accomplished works may be named "The Last Honors paid to Counts Egmont and Horn by the Corporations of the Town of Brussels", now at Tournai; "The Death of Egmont", in the Berlin gallery; the "Coronation of Baudouin, Emperor of Constantinople", painted for Versailles; "The Temptation of St Anthony", in the palace at Brussels; "The Siege of Antioch", "Art and Liberty", "Portrait of M. B. Dumortier" and "The Plague at Tournay", all in the Brussels gallery. "A Gipsy Woman and her Children" was painted in 1852. He also served as the director and president of the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts.
"M. Gallait has all the gifts that may be acquired by work, taste, judgment and determination," wrote Théophile Gautier. His art is that of a man of tact, a skilled painter, happy in his dramatic treatment but superficial. No doubt, this Walloon artist, following the example of the Flemings of the Renaissance and the treatment of Belgian classical painters and the French Romantic school, sincerely aimed at truth. Unfortunately, misled by contemporary taste, he could not conceive of it other than as dressed in sentimentality. As an artist employed by the State, he exercised considerable influence, and for a long time he was the leader of public taste in Brussels.
Notable students include Cesare Dell'Acqua.

Michael Jonzun

Michael Jonzun, a musician and producer of electro, and especially electro funk, was born in Florida, and formed the Jonzun Crew in Boston with Steve Thorpe and Gordy Worthy. In the early 1980s, the group recorded electro dance tracks including "Pack Jam (Look Out for the OVC)" and "Space Cowboy". The former was inspired by Michael Jonzun's distaste toward the popular "Pac-Man" video game.
He made several more LPs with less commercial success through the 1980s and produced many other artists' recordings. His brother and frequent collaborator is Maurice Starr, mastermind of New Edition and New Kids on the Block; Michael Jonzun contributed to early tracks by both groups. He also worked on Peter Wolf's "Lights Out" and Tom Browne's "Rockin' Radio". In 1986, he left the band to pursue a solo career and released an album on A&M Records.

<doc id="2896867" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2896867" title="Praise You">
Praise You

"Praise You" is a song by British big beat musician Fatboy Slim. It was released as the third single from his second studio album, "You've Come a Long Way, Baby", in 1999. It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, number two in Belgium, number four in Canada, number six in the Republic of Ireland and number thirty six in the United States.
Samples.
The song features a prominent vocal sample from the opening of "Take Yo' Praise" by Camille Yarbrough, as well as a prominent piano sample from the track "Balance and Rehearsal" from a test LP titled "Sessions" released by audio electronics company JBL. The song also features a guitar sample from the opening of "It's a Small World" from the Disneyland Records-released LP "Mickey Mouse Disco", and the song's bridge also samples the theme from the cartoon series "Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids".
Music video.
The accompanying video for "Praise You" was directed by Spike Jonze. Jonze starred in the film under the pseudonym Richard Koufey, along with a fictional dance group The Torrance Community Dance Group. Moreover, the video is called "A Torrance Public Film Production" in its intro.
The video was shot guerrilla-style (that is, on location without obtaining permission from the owners of the property) in front of puzzled onlookers outside a movie theatre in Westwood, California. In the video, Jonze and the dance group dance to "Praise You", much to the chagrin of a theatre employee who turns off their portable stereo. One of the actor-dancers in the fictional Torrance Community Dance Group, Michael Gier, documents the making of the "Praise You" video on his website.
The "Praise You" video came into being because Spike Jonze, unable to work with Fatboy Slim on the video for "The Rockafeller Skank", recorded and sent his own solo dance video to "Skank" as a gift; Jonze's 'alternate' music video was so well received by Slim that Jonze's fictional Torrance Community Dance Group was green-lighted for the official video for "Praise You".
Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim) is briefly seen in the video as one of the many onlookers, with the clearest view shown at the conclusion of the video, while Jonze is talking about the dance. Cook curiously peers over Jonze to catch a glimpse of the camera before walking off to the right.
The video reportedly cost only US$800 to produce, with most of that money going towards a replacement boombox and food for the cast and crew.
The video won three major awards at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards: Breakthrough Video, Best Direction (awarded to "Torrance Community Dance Group"), and Best Choreography (awarded to "Richard Koufey & Michael Rooney"). It was also nominated for, but did not win, Best Dance Video. The group also put on a dance performance to the song at the awards. In 2001, it was voted number one of the 100 best videos of all time, in a poll to mark the 20th anniversary of MTV.
Use in media.
The first episode of "" during the make-over sequence in Paris. It was also used in an episode of The Story of Tracy Beaker "The Break-In".
The radio edit was featured in the original motion picture soundtrack of the 1999 film, Cruel Intentions.

After earning a music degree, Buttolph moved to Europe in 1923 and studied in Austria and Germany supporting himself as a nightclub pianist. He returned to the U.S. in 1927 and, a few years later, began working for NBC radio network as an arranger and conductor. In 1933, Buttolph moved to Los Angeles and began working in films.

Jonzun Crew

Jonzun Crew was an electro and early funk–hip hop group that was active in the 1980s. The group was led by Michael Jonzun, his brothers Maurice Starr and Soni Jonzun, and Carl (Captain Fingers).
The group's most famous tracks, “Pack Jam (Look out for the OVC),” “Space is the Place,” and “Space Cowboy” were featured on the group's debut album, "Lost in Space" (1983). Other notable tracks included “We Are the Jonzun Crew” and “Ground Control.” The group's sound was particularly unique because all of the synthesizer parts were played live as opposed to sequenced, and despite using drum-machine hits in its tracks, most of the group's songs used a live drummer as the main drum track, giving its songs a unique groove and swing compared to most electro music of the era.
Jonzun Crew was an electro group that carried its spin on Parliament-Funkadelic's loopy sci-fi themes of Afro-futurism throughout the 1980s and early 1990s for a handful of albums, which included singles such as “Pack Jam (Look Out for the OVC),” “Space is the Place,” “Space Cowboy,” and “We are the Jonzun Crew.” Florida-born brothers Michael, Soni, and Larry Johnson (better known as Maurice Starr) formed the Jonzun Crew in Boston in 1981, with Gordy Worthy and Steve Thorpe filling out the lineup for different stretches of the group's existence. Starr and Michael would gain further notoriety for helping to bring New Edition and New Kids on the Block to the world; Michael (who continued using Jonzun as his last name) also went solo for a brief period on A&M, in addition to working on several other artists' releases.
In 1986, Michael Jonzun left the group. “Pack Jam (Look out for the OVC)” was often played in the background while the rundown of top hits in Germany were counted on the German-language Top Hits show "Formel Eins" during the 1980s.

Edmund Lodge

Sir Edmund Lodge, KH (1756–1839), herald, was a long-serving English officer of arms, a writer on heraldic subjects, and a compiler of short biographies.
Life and career.
Lodge was born in Poland Street, London on 13 June 1756, the son of Edmund Lodge, rector of Carshalton, Surrey and his wife, Mary Garrard, daughter of Richard Garrard of Carshalton. Little is known of his education, but he briefly held a cornet's commission in the army, which he resigned in 1773. In 1782 he became Bluemantle Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary at the College of Arms. He subsequently became Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary, Norroy King of Arms, and Clarenceux King of Arms, in other words second in command of the college. In 1832, he was made a knight of the Hanoverian Royal Guelphic Order. He married Jane-Anne-Elizabeth Field (died May 1820) on 27 April 1808, but they had no children. He died at his house in Bloomsbury Square, London on 16 January 1839.
Publications.
Lodge wrote "Illustrations of British History, Biography, and Manners in the Reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary, Elizabeth and James I" (3 vols., 1791), which consisted of selections from the manuscripts of the Howard, Talbot and Cecil families preserved at the College of Arms. He also wrote "Life of Sir Julius Caesar" (2nd ed., 1827). He contributed the literary matter to "Portraits of Illustrious Personages of Great Britain" (1814, &c.), an elaborate work of which a popular edition is included in Bohn's "Illustrated Library". His most important work on heraldry was "The Genealogy of the Existing British Peerage" (1832; enlarged edition, 1859).

Charles Xavier Thomas

Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar (May 5, 1785–March 12, 1870) was a French inventor and entrepreneur best known for designing, patenting and manufacturing the first commercially successful mechanical calculator, the Arithmometer and for founding the insurance companies "Le Soleil" and "L'aigle" which, under his leadership, became the number one insurance group in France at the beginning of the Second Empire.
After a short employment in the French administration, he joined the French army in 1809 eventually reaching the level of General Manager of the supply store of all of the armies located in Spain in 1813. Shortly thereafter he was promoted to Inspector of Supply for the entire French army. It was during that time that he conceived the idea of the Arithmometer to help him with the great deal of calculations that he had to perform.
Back into civilian life, in 1819, he co-founded the fire insurance company "Phoenix" which he left quickly because of the lack of support for his new ideas from his partners and shareholders. Ten years later, in 1829, he started the fire insurance company "Le Soleil" that he grew by merger and acquisitions until his death. In 1843 he started another insurance company called "L'Aigle incendie". With the Sun (soleil) symbol of previous kings of France and the Eagle (aigle) reminiscent of Napoleon, he had all bases covered to attract a wide range of customers in a very divided 19th century France. By his death the "Aigle - Soleil" group was the biggest insurance business in France and he owned 81% of it. Eighty years later, in 1946, it was nationalized and finally merged with "La National" in 1968 to become the GAN company which is still in business today.
Thomas was made Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur for his invention of the Arithmometer in 1821. This is when he changed his name from "M. Charles Xavier Thomas" to "M. le Chevalier Thomas, de Colmar" and later simply "Thomas de Colmar". Again because of the Arithmometer, he was raised to the level of Officier of the Légion d'honneur in 1857.
Initially Thomas spent all of his time and energy on his insurance business, therefore there is a hiatus of more than thirty years in between the first model of the Arithmometer introduced in 1820 and its true commercialization in 1852. By the time of his death in 1870, his manufacturing facility had built around 1,000 Arithmometers, making it the first mass-produced mechanical calculator in the world, and at the time, the only mechanical calculator reliable and dependable enough to be used in places like government agencies, banks, insurance companies and observatories just to name a few. The manufacturing of the Arithmometer went on for another 40 years until around 1914.
He married Francesca (Frasquita) Garcia de Ampudia Alvarez in Seville in 1812. She came from an old Andalusian noble family. Together, they had ten children: Joseph Thomas d'Alvarez, Charlotte (Countess de Rancy), Louis Thomas who married Livia Carafa, Duchess of Bojano and took the name of Thomas de Bojano, Frasquita (Mrs Soultzner d'Enschwyl) and Henriette (Countess de Dalmas).

John Walsh (scientist)

John Walsh (1 July 1726 – 9 March 1795) was a British scientist and Secretary to the Governor of Bengal.
John was son of Joseph Walsh, Secretary to the Governor of Fort St. George and cousin to Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, and his sister Margaret, the wife of Lord Clive.
He entered the English East India Company at the age of fifteen and eventually became Clive's private secretary. During the 1757 Plassey campaign against the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj Ud Daulah, John Walsh was awarded £56,000 in prize money. Upon his return to England in 1759, his fortune was estimated at £147,000, and he quickly sought to purchase the necessary trappings of aristocratic power in eighteenth century Britain: land and political influence. In late 1764, Walsh purchased the large estate of Warfield Park, near Bracknell in Berkshire and spent the next two years doing it up. He was MP for Worcester from 1761 to 1780. He continued to serve Robert Clive, or 'Clive of India' as he became known, and attempted to form a parliamentary interest in his favour.
In later life, John Walsh's interests were scientific. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1770 and awarded their Copley Medal in 1773 for a paper on the electrical properties of torpedo fish.
Upon his death in 1795, Sir John Walsh, as he was then known, left his fortune to his niece, Margaret Walsh, and her husband, John Benn, on the condition that they change their surname to Benn-Walsh. With his own fortune of £80,000 made in India while Assistant to the Resident of Benares, his brother-in-law Francis Fowke in the 1770s, John Benn-Walsh had become a very wealthy man and went on to inherit extensive estates in Warfield, Buckinghamshire, in Radnorshire, and in Ormathwaite, Cumberland and be created Baron Ormathwaite.

Northern Rockies Regional Municipality

The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality (NRRM), formerly the Northern Rockies Regional District (NRRD), and before that the Fort Nelson-Liard Regional District, is a regional municipality in northeastern British Columbia, Canada. Its offices are located in Fort Nelson, formerly an incorporated town that amalgamated with the NRRD on February 6, 2009 to form the NRRM. With the Peace River Regional District as the southern part, it was the northern part of the Peace River-Liard Regional District, which was split into two on October 31, 1987.
The NRRM lies on the east slope of the Rocky Mountains, and comprises approximately 10% of the total area of the province of British Columbia, encompassing . Its southern boundary is the 58th parallel of latitude and is bisected by the Alaska Highway from its southeast to its northwest. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality is primarily made up of heavily forested areas and mountainous terrain.
The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality is the first of its kind in British Columbia in which an entire region is governed and headed by a single municipal government. Its regional board consists of six regional councilors and one regional leader, known as the mayor. Bill Streeper has been the NRRM's mayor since it was formed.
Communities.
Fort Nelson.
With a 2011 population of 3,902, Fort Nelson is the largest community in the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality. All of the NRRM's offices and officials are based out of Fort Nelson.

The reserve is home to about 700 residents, making Fort Nelson First Nation one of the largest reservations in northern British Columbia. Dene and Cree are the most prevalent Aboriginal Canadian backgrounds found on the Fort Nelson First Nation reserve. The nation works closely with oil and gas producers to ensure safe and sustainable development in the Horn River Basin based on the fact that much of the new development in the Horn River Basin is occurring on traditional Fort Nelson First Nation land. The band operates Echo-Dene and the Liard Hot Springs lodge, as well as the band's very own kindergarten to grade twelve accredited educational institution named Chalo School. Kathi Dickie is currently the chief at Fort Nelson First Nation.
Prophet River First Nation.
The Prophet River First Nation is the southernmost community in the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality.

Annual average daily traffic, abbreviated AADT, is a measure used primarily in transportation planning and transportation engineering. Traditionally, it is the total volume of vehicle traffic of a highway or road for a year divided by 365 days. AADT is a useful and simple measurement of how busy the road is. Newer advances for traffic data providers are now providing AADT by side of the road, by day of week and by time of day.

One of the most important uses of AADT is for determining funding for the maintenance and improvement of Highways.
In the United States the amount of federal funding a state will receive is related to the total traffic measured across its Highway network. Each year on June 15, every state in the United States submits a Highway Performance Monitoring System HPMS report. The HPMS report contains various information regarding the road segments in the state based on a sample (not all of the road segments) of the road segments. In the report, the AADT is converted to Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). VMT is the AADT multiplied by the length of the road segment. To determine the amount of traffic a state has, the AADT cannot be summed for all road segments since an AADT is a rate. The VMT is summed and is used as an indicator of the amount of traffic a state has. For federal-funding, formulas are applied to include the VMT and other highway statistics.
In the United Kingdom AADT is one of a number of measures of traffic used by Local Highway Authorities, the Highways Agency and the Department for Transport to forecast maintenance needs and expenditure.
Data collection.
To measure AADT on individual road segments, traffic data is collected either by an automated traffic counter or hiring an observer to record traffic. There are two different techniques of measuring the AADTs for road segments. One technique is called continuous count data collection method. This is where sensors are permanently embedded into a road and traffic data is measured all 365 days. The AADT would be the sum of the total traffic for the entire year divided by 365 days. There is a problem with calculating the AADT with this method. The continuous count equipment is not operating for the full 365 days due to being shut down for maintenance or repair. Because of this, seasonal or day-of-week biases might skew the calculated AADT. In 1992, AASHTO released the AASHTO Guidelines for Traffic Data Programs, which identified a way to produce an AADT without seasonal or day-of-week biases by creating an "average of averages." For every month and day-of-week, a Monthly Average Day of Week (MADW) is calculated (84 per year). Each day-of-week's MADW is then calculated across months to calculate an Annual Average Day of Week (AADW) (7 per year). Finally, the AADWs are averaged to calculate an AADT. The United States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has adopted this method as the preferred method in the Traffic Monitoring Guide[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/tmguide/tmg2.htm#Computing%20AADT].
While providing the most accurate AADT, installing and maintaining continuous count stations method is costly. Most agencies are only able to monitor a very small percentage of the roadway using this method. Most AADTs are generated using short-term data collection methods sometimes known as the coverage count data collection method. Traffic is collected with portable sensors that are attached to the road and record traffic data typically for 2 – 14 days. These are typically pneumatic road tubes although other more expensive technology such as radar, laser, or sonar exist. After recording the traffic data, the traffic counts on the same road segment are taken again in another three years. FHWA Traffic Monitoring Guide [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/tmguide/tmg3.htm#hpmsvolume] recommends performing a short count on a road segment at a minimum of every three years. There are many methods used to calculate an AADT from a short-term count, but most methods attempt to remove seasonal and day-of-week biases during the collection period by applying factors created from associated continuous counters. Short counts are taken either by state agencies, local government, or contractors.
For the years when a traffic count is not recorded, the AADT is often estimated by applying a factor called the Growth Factor. Growth Factors are statistically determined from historical data of the road segment. If there is no historical data, Growth Factors from similar road segments are used.
Average Annual Weekday Traffic (AAWT).
Average annual weekday traffic (AAWT) is similar to AADT but only includes Monday to Friday data. Public holidays are often excluded from the AAWT calculation.
Average summer daily traffic.
Average summer daily traffic (abbreviated to "ASDT") is a similar measure to the annual average daily traffic. Data collecting methods of the two are exactly the same, however the ASDT data is collected during summer only. The measure is useful in areas where there are significant seasonal traffic volumes carried by a given road.
Average Daily Traffic.
Average daily traffic or ADT, and sometimes also mean daily traffic, is the average number of vehicles two-way passing a specific point in a 24-hour period, normally measured throughout a year. ADT is not as highly referred to as the engineering standard of AADT which is the standard measurement for vehicle traffic load on a section of road, and the basis for most decisions regarding transport planning, or to the environmental hazards of pollution related to road transport.

Federico de Madrazo

Federico de Madrazo y Kuntz (12 February 1815 – 11 June 1894) was a Spanish painter. 
Born in Rome, he was the son of the painter Madrazo y Agudo (1781–1859), and received his first instruction from his father. While still attending the classes at the Royal Academy of San Fernando, he painted his first picture, "The Resurrection of Christ" (1829), which was purchased by Queen Christina. Not long afterwards he painted "Achilles in his Tent", and subsequently presented to the Academy "The Continence of Scipio", which secured him admission as a member "for merit". 
While decorating the palace of Vista Alegre he took up portraiture. In 1852 he went to Paris, where he studied under Franz Winterhalter, and painted portraits of Baron Taylor and Ingres. In 1837 he was commissioned to produce a picture for the gallery at Versailles, and painted "Godfrey de Bouillon proclaimed King of Jerusalem". The artist then went to Rome, where he worked at various subjects, sacred and profane. Then he painted "Maria Christina in the Dress of a Nun by the Bedside of Ferdinand III" (1843), "Queen Isabella", "The Duchess of Medina-Coeli", and "The Countess de Vilches" (1845–47), besides a number of portraits of the Spanish aristocracy, some of which were sent to the exhibition of 1855. 
He received the Legion of Honour in 1846. He was made a corresponding member of the Paris Academy of Fine Arts on 10 December 1853, and in 1873, on the death of Schnorr, the painter, he was chosen foreign member. After his father's death he succeeded him as director of the Museo del Prado and president of the Academy of San Fernando. He originated in Spain the production of art reviews and journals, such as "El Artiste", "El Renacimiento", and "El Semanario pintoresco". He died at Madrid in 1894. 
His brother, Don Luis de Madrazo, was also known as a painter, chiefly by his "Burial of Saint Cecilia" (1855). Federico's best-known pupil was his son, Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta (1841–1920).

Danehof

Danehof ("Danish Court") was the name of the Danish medieval parliament which played a certain role between c. 1250 and 1413.
The precondition of the Danehof – like that of the Håndfæstning - was the growing power and opposition among the Danish magnates after 1250. They wanted limitations of the royal power, especially of its right of legislation and taxation. The political weakness of the royal house during this period seems to have promoted its development. By 1282, King Eric V of Denmark had so offended the nobles throughout Denmark that he was forced to accept a Royal Charter ("Håndfæstning"), which limited his authority and guaranteed the ancient rights and customs which preserved the power of the nobles. 
About the details of the establishment and form of the Danehof, surprisingly little is known. It had to be gathered at a central site which was often Nyborg Castle on Funen but nothing is known of elections or procedures. Its members consisted only of magnates, clergy and noblemen. The king was to consult this parliament before he took greater steps especially of economic character. However in several cases, the kings ignored the Danehof by omitting to summon it. By the creation of the first Haandfæstning in 1282, more defined rules were established. However in reality the Danehof was only summoned at special occasions.
The disasters and chaos in Denmark during the 14th century did not strengthen the authority of the Danehof. Step by step it was ousted by not only the royal power but also by the Danish Council of the state ("Rigsraadet"), the Privy Council or inner circle of magnates that often controlled the king. Dating from the 1320s, it became the role of the Rigsraadet to rule together with the king and to manage the affairs of State.

TERENA

The Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association (TERENA, ) is a not-for-profit association of European national research and education networks (NRENs) incorporated in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The association was originally formed on 13 June 1986 as Réseaux Associés pour la Recherche Européenne (RARE) and changed its name to TERENA in October 1994.
Purpose.
The objectives of TERENA are to promote and develop high-quality international network infrastructures to support European research and education. This includes:
Full membership of TERENA is open to NRENs (one per member country of the ITU) and international public sector organisations. Associate membership is available for other organisations (commercial or otherwise) with an interest in research and education networking. A complete list of the current members can be found on the TERENA website.
Similar organisations elsewhere in the world include Internet2, APAN, UbuntuNet Alliance and CLARA (Cooperación Latino Americana de Redes Avanzadas). In addition, DANTE operates the pan-European research and education backbone network.
History.
TERENA was founded under the name Réseaux Associés pour la Recherche Européenne (RARE) on 13 June 1986. It was created by several European networking organisations to promote open computer networking standards (specifically the OSI protocols). The first few years were dominated by the Co-operation for Open Systems Interconnection Networking in Europe (COSINE) project.
COSINE led to the implementation of some of the first standardised network-related services, for example X.400 email and X.500 directory service. X.25 technology was generally used for connectivity. This technology was also used in a network called IXI (International X.25 Infrastructure Backbone Service), which was the first generation of the backbone network interconnecting the national research networks in Europe, known today as GÉANT. To run the European backbone, RARE’s Operational Unit was later split off from the association under the name DANTE.
Meanwhile the need to choose between the OSI protocols and the Internet Protocol (IP) became the subject of a long-lasting controversy known as the "Protocol Wars". By the early 1990s, IP became the dominant protocol in data networking. By 1991, a project called Ebone was proposed as an interim solution while the European research networking community made the transition from OSI to IP. The Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC) was created by RARE in 1992, and was split off five years later as a separate legal entity. 
At the end of 1983 IBM had taken the initiative for the European Academic and Research Network (EARN), which would link selected computer centres in Europe via leased lines. It used similar technology to the BITNET in the US, and included email gateway capability. The EARN Association was set up as a legal entity in France in 1985. By 1993 it was clear that the EARN Association needed to merge with RARE, which it did on 20 October 1994. At the same time, RARE changed its name to TERENA.
Outreach.
TERENA publishes annual editions of the "TERENA Compendium of National Research and Education Networks in Europe", which contain information about the organisation, staffing, finances, user base, capacity, services and developments of NRENs, and serve as a benchmarking tool.
TERENA supports the development of research and education networking in less advanced countries and regions in and around Europe by studying their needs and by providing advice, consultancy and training.
TERENA organises foresight studies to look into the future development of European research and education networking. These studies included SERENATE (2002-2003), EARNEST (2006-2008) and ASPIRE (2011-2012).
Task Forces and Projects.
TERENA supports joint European work in the development and testing of new networking, middleware and application technologies. It brings together specialists and engineers from TERENA member organisations and the wider research networking community. This work is organised in task forces and projects.
Task forces are groups where specialists in a certain field exchange information, discuss best practices and work together to investigate technologies for the development and deployment of services for the research and education community. Usually task forces are open for participation by any individual who can bring appropriate expertise and resources. By 2011, TERENA was supporting eight task forces: TF-CPR (communications and public relations), TF-CSIRT (collaboration of security incident response teams), TF-EMC2 (European middleware coordination and collaboration), TF-Media (media management and distribution), TF-MNM (mobility and network middleware), TF-MSP (management of service portfolios), TF-NOC (network operation centres) and TF-Storage (storage and cloud services).
TERENA projects are carried out by experts and engineers on the basis of a contract with TERENA. This requires funding from TERENA members and/or other interested organisations, possibly combined with a contribution from TERENA's own resources. A current example is REFEDS (Research and Education Federations).
In addition, the TERENA Secretariat staff participates in projects that are co-funded by the European Union, for example, the project that also provides EU funding for the GÉANT network.
Services.
A number of services have been established as spin-offs of the work in the TERENA task forces and projects. eduroam provides researchers, teachers and students easy and secure network access when visiting other institutions than their own; the global governance of eduroam is under the auspices of TERENA. The TERENA Certificate Service provides digital certificates that are recognised by the major browsers and devices to the user communities of participating NRENs in a cost-effective manner. The TERENA Academic Certification Authority Repository (TACAR) is a trusted online store of trust anchor certificates, related certificate policies and certificate practice statements registered by the Certification Authorities of organisations in the academic community. The eduGAIN service allows Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructures to interact, enabling the sharing of data between federations and providing an interconnection framework to applications willing to provide their services, content or resources to multiple federations. NRENum.net provides an ENUM service for academia. TERENA's Trusted Introducer service offers an accreditation and certification scheme for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).
Conference.
TERENA runs an annual conference for academic networkers called the TERENA Networking Conference. Usually held in late May or early June, the conference is hosted by a member NREN and attended by around 500 delegates from academic backgrounds including networking specialists and managers from European networking and research organisations, universities, worldwide sister institutions and industry representatives. 
Conference locations: Dublin (2014), Maastricht (2013), Reykjavík (2012), Prague (2011), Vilnius (2010), Málaga (2009), Brugge (2008), Kgs. Lyngby (2007), Catania (2006), Poznan (2005), Rhodes (2004), Zagreb (2003), Limerick (2002), Antalya (2001), Lisbon (2000), Lund (joint with NORDUnet conference; 1999), Dresden (1998).
The TERENA Networking Conference is the successor to the Joint European Networking Conference (JENC), which ran from 1990 to 1997. Locations: Edinburgh (1997), Budapest (1996), Tel Aviv (1995), Prague (joint with Internet Society's INET conference; 1994), Trondheim (1993), Innsbruck (1992), Blois (1991), Killarney (1990).
The JENC, in turn, was the successor to the RARE Networkshop, which ran from 1986 to 1989. Locations: Trieste (1989), Les Diablerets (1988), Valencia (1987), Copenhagen (1986). At the first workshop in this series, held in Luxembourg in May 1985, it was decided to create RARE.
Workshops and Training.
TERENA regularly organises workshops for information exchange and training. Training workshops include the TRANSITS workshops aimed at staff members of CSIRTs and the EuroCAMP workshops to teach NREN and campus staff how to implement federated identity infrastructure.

Fantasy basketball

Fantasy basketball is a fantasy sport inspired by fantasy baseball. Originally played by keeping track of stats by hand, it was popularized during the 1990s after the advent of the Internet. Those who play this game are sometimes referred to as general managers (GMs), who draft actual National Basketball Association (NBA) players and compute their basketball statistics. The game was popularized by ESPN Fantasy Sports, NBA.com, and Yahoo! Fantasy Sports.
League settings.
There are many rule variations when playing fantasy basketball. The rules used in a particular league are determined by the rule settings. Some common rule variations are discussed below.
Categories.
Commonly, fantasy basketball leagues may track as few as three or as many as eleven categories. Three-category leagues usually account for only points, rebounds, and assists. Five-category leagues generally add blocks and steals. Eight-category leagues usually add field goal percentage, free throw percentage, and either three-point field goals made or three-point field goal percentage. Nine-category leagues usually add turnovers. Rarely, other statistics such as fouls are counted. Some leagues also prefer to break down the rebounds category into two categories: offensive and defensive rebounds.
Some leagues allow the league "commissioner" to determine which categories will be tracked. If these categories are chosen poorly, the league may be unfairly weighted for or against certain positions. For example, a league that tracks points, assists, steals, free throw percentage and three-point field goals would be weighted toward guards, who typically have higher numbers in many of those categories, and against power forwards and centers, who typically have higher numbers in the rebound, block and field goal percentage categories, which are not counted.
Number of teams.
In public leagues, the number of teams in a league is typically ten or twelve. In private leagues, which are invitation-only and usually utilized by players who want to compete against a group of people they know, the number of teams will vary substantially.
Fantasy drafts.
There are two types of drafting used to select players: the snake draft and the auction draft. In a snake draft, the first round is drafted in order. In the second round, the draft order is reversed so that the manager who made the last pick in the first round gets the first pick in the second round. The order is reversed at the end of each round so that the manager with the first overall pick does not maintain this advantage in every round. In an auction draft, each manager has a set budget (commonly $260, an amount borrowed from fantasy baseball) that he or she must use to fill out the team's roster. Players are put up for auction by managers, and the manager willing to pay the most for the player "drafts" that player. The advantage of an auction is that all managers have equal access to all players (not the case in a snake draft). The disadvantages are that it typically takes longer than a snake draft, and can be intimidating for newer or inexperienced managers who may be relying on ranking.
Communication.
Some leagues have a feature whereby players can communicate through the site. Many sites have "Smack Talk" features which allow players to communicate with one another whenever they want. They can trash-talk their opponents during the game or before the games start.
Scoring types.
Rotisserie (ROTO).
In rotisserie scoring, the real-life statistics accumulated by the players on a team are aggregated and ranked against the same statistics for the other teams in the league. Fantasy points are earned based on these rankings. For example, in a twelve-team league, the team with the most rebounds over the course of the season to date would be awarded twelve fantasy points. The team with the next-highest number of rebounds would be awarded eleven fantasy points, and so on, with the team with the fewest rebounds being awarded a single fantasy point. For negative categories like fouls or turnovers, the team with the fewest statistics is awarded the most fantasy points. This is done for all categories counted by the particular league. The team with the highest number of fantasy points at the end of the season is the winner.
Rotisserie scoring encourages balance on the team's roster. Winning the rebounds category by one rebound or by one thousand rebounds counts the same, while winning the steals category by one steal and the assists category by one assist is worth "twice" as many points as winning the single rebounding category by one thousand rebounds. Successful teams must fare well in several categories to win in rotisserie leagues.
Head-to-head (H2H).
In head-to-head scoring, teams compete against a single other team over the course of a week. During that week, the real-life statistics of the players on each team are accumulated, and at the end of the week the team with the most points over the week wins.
There are two styles of head-to-head scoring:
Head-to-head leagues often employ a "playoff" system, with seeding based on the seasonal win-loss record. Matchups are determined via a bracket, with the winners of each matchup advancing and the losers being eliminated until a winner is determined.
In head-to-head leagues, schedules can be changed in the time until the first game of that match-up.
Fantasy points.
In fantasy point scoring, the commissioner determines the number of fantasy points that a particular statistic is worth. For example, the commissioner may determine that a steal is worth two fantasy points, where a rebound is only worth one, and a turnover is worth negative one. Fantasy points are accumulated nightly based on the real-life performance of the players on each team, and the team with the most fantasy points at the end of the season wins.
As when choosing categories, care must be paid in assigning fantasy point values to categories. Failure to achieve balance will result in weighting the league for or against players at certain positions.
Daily fantasy basketball.
Like traditional fantasy basketball, in daily fantasy basketball, players draft a team of NBA players who then score fantasy points according to set scoring rules. However, instead of being stuck with the same team through a whole season, daily fantasy sports contests last just one day.

Participatory management

Participatory management is the practice of empowering employees to participate in organizational decision making. This practice grew out of the human relations movement in the 1920s, and is based on some of the principles discovered by scholars doing research in management and organization studies, such as the Hawthorne Effect.
While senior managers still retain final decision making authority when participatory management is practiced, employees are encouraged to voice their opinions about their working conditions in a safe environment, protected from the potential defensiveness of middle managers who they might criticize.
In the 1990s, participatory management was revived in a different form through advocacy of organizational learning practices, particularly by clients and students of Peter Senge. 
There is some criticism of participatory management (see Heckscher, below), particularly because it is difficult to combine this practice with a more financially oriented approach to restructuring that may require downsizing.

Christopher Middleton (navigator)

Christopher Middleton (late 17th century – 12 February 1770) was an English naval officer and navigator. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 7 April 1737.
Middleton was appointed on 5 March 1741 to the command of the Royal Navy's bomb vessel, HMS "Furnace", which was refitted at Deptford Dockyard and re-rigged as a three-masted ship. In May 1741 he left England in the "Furnace", accompanied by a smaller vessel, the purchased HMS "Discovery" under the command of Commander William Moor, and sailed to Hudson Bay in search of a Northwest Passage. He spent the winter at Churchill, Manitoba. He then proceeded north into Roes Welcome Sound and discovered Wager Inlet where he was iced in for three weeks. At the head of the sound he was blocked by ice and named the place Repulse Bay. He returned to England in 1742, where he was presented with the Copley Medal by the Royal Society to whom he presented a paper on "The extraordinary degrees and surprising effects of Cold in Hudson's Bay".

<doc id="2897095" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2897095" title="François Pierre La Varenne">
François Pierre La Varenne

François Pierre de la Varenne (1615–1678 in Dijon), Burgundian by birth, was the author of "Le Cuisinier françois" (1651), the founding text of modern French cuisine. La Varenne broke with the Italian traditions that had revolutionized medieval and Renaissance French cookery in the 16th century and early 17th century. La Varenne was the foremost member of a group of French chefs, writing for a professional audience, who codified French cuisine for the age of Louis XIV. The others were Nicolas Bonnefon, "Le Jardinier françois" (1651) and "Les Délices de la campagne" (1654), and François Massialot, "Le Cuisinier royal et bourgeois" (1691), which was still being edited and modernized in the mid-18th century.
The seventeenth century saw a culinary revolution which transported French gastronomy into the modern era. The heavily spiced flavours inherited from the cuisine of the Middle Ages were abandoned in favour of the natural flavours of foods. Exotic and costy spices (saffron, cinnamon, cumin, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, nigella, seeds of paradise) were, with the exception of pepper, replaced by local herbs (parsley, thyme, bayleaf, chervil, sage, tarragon). New vegetables like cauliflower, asparagus, peas, cucumber and artichoke were introduced. Special care was given to the cooking of meat in order to conserve maximum flavour. Vegetables had to be fresh and tender. Fish, with the improvement of transportation, had to be impeccably fresh. Preparation had to respect the gustatory and visual integrity of the ingredients instead of masking them as had been the practice previously. Finally, a rigorous separation between salted and sweet dishes was introduced, the former served before the latter, banishing the Italian Renaissance taste for mixing sweet and salted ingredients in the same dish or in same part of the meal.
La Varenne's work was the first to set down in writing the considerable culinary innovations achieved in France in the seventeenth century, while codifying food preparation in a systematic manner, according to rules and principles. He introduced the first bisque and Béchamel sauce. He replaced crumbled bread with roux as the base for sauces, and lard with butter. Here one finds the first usage of the terms bouquet garni, "fonds de cuisine" (stocks) and reductions, and the use of egg-whites for clarification. It also contains the earliest recipe in print for mille-feuille. The cooking of vegetables is addressed, an unusual departure. In a fragrant sauce for asparagus there is evidence of an early form of hollandaise sauce: "make a sauce with good fresh butter, a little vinegar, salt, and nutmeg, and an egg yolk to bind the sauce; take care that it doesn't curdle..."
La Varenne preceded his book with a text on "confitures"—jams, jellies and preserves—that included recipes for syrups, compotes and a great variety of fruit drinks, as well as a section on salads (1650).
La Varenne followed his groundbreaking work with a third book, "Le Pâtissier françois" (Paris 1653), which is generally credited with being the first comprehensive French work on pastry-making. In 1662 appeared the first of the combined editions that presented all three works together. All the early editions of La Varenne's works—"Le Cuisinier françois" ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years—are extremely rare; like children's books, they too were worn to pieces, in the kitchen, and simply used up.
Pirated editions of "Le Cuisinier françois" were printed in Amsterdam (1653) and The Hague (1654–56). Soon there were imitators: "Le Cuisinier françois méthodique" was published anonymously in Paris, 1660. The English translation, "The French Cook" (London 1653) was the first French cookbook translated into English. It introduced professional terms like "à la mode", "au bleu" (very rare), and "au naturel" which are now standard culinary expressions. Its success can be gauged from the fact that over 250,000 copies were printed in about 250 editions and it remained in print until 1815.
It is said that La Varenne's first training was in the kitchens of the queen Marie de Medici. At the time his books were published, La Varenne had ten years' experience as "chef de cuisine" to Nicolas Chalon du Blé, Marquis of Uxelles ("marquis d'Uxelles" in French), to whom he dedicated his publications and whom he immortalized in "duxelles", finely-minced mushrooms seasoned with herbs and shallots, which is still a favourite flavouring for fish and vegetables. The Marquis of Uxelles was the royal governor of Chalon-sur-Saône, thought by some to be the birthplace of La Varenne.
"Le Cuisinier françois" was reprinted in 1983, published by Editions Montalba and edited by Jean-Marie Flandrin, Philip Hyman and Mary Hyman with a comprehensive introductory essay.

Five-eighth

Five-eighth or Stand-off half is one of the positions in a rugby league football team. Wearing jersey number 6, this player is one of the two "half backs", in a team's back line, partnering the scrum half (Number 7). Also known as the pivot or second receiver, in a traditional attacking back-line play the five-eighth would receive the ball from his half back partner, who is the "first-receiver" of the ball from the "dummy-half" or hooker following a tackle. The role of the five-eighth from second-receiver was then to employ their creative passing skills to move the ball away from the congested mid-field further out along the backline to the "outside backs", the centres and wingers, who have more space to run with it. Furthermore, players in this position typically assume responsibility for kicking the ball for field-position in general play. The five-eighth is therefore considered one of the most important positions, often referred to as a "play maker", assuming a decision-making role on the field. Over time however, as the game has evolved, the roles of the two halves have grown more aligned and difficult to distinguish. Along with other key positions, fullback, hooker and scrum half back, the five-eighth makes up what is known as a team's "spine".
One book published in 1996 stated that in senior rugby league, the five-eighth and hooker handled the ball more often than any other position.
The Rugby League International Federation's Laws of the Game state that the "Stand-off half or Five-eighth" is to be numbered 6. However, traditionally players' jersey numbers have varied, and in the modern Super League, each squad's players are assigned individual numbers regardless of position.
Etymology.
Traditionally in rugby football, there have always been two half-backs as well as scrums involving the forwards. Of the two half backs, the name "scrum half" was given to the one which was involved in the scrum by feeding the ball into it and the name "stand-off half" was given to the one which stood away from the scrum. In Britain, where rugby league originated, this terminology has been retained. In Australian English however, "five-eighth" is the term used for the number 6, to differentiate from the half back which is number 7. In New Zealand, both terms appear to be used interchangeably.
Notable five-eighths.
Stand-off halves that feature in their respective nations' rugby league halls of fame are England's Roger Millward, Australia's Wally Lewis, Bob Fulton, Albert Rosenfeld and Vic Hey, and New Zealand's George Menzies.

Steamed bread

Steamed bread is a kind of bread, typically made from wheat, which is produced by steaming instead of baking. Steamed bread is produced and consumed all around the world. In Chinese cuisine, "mantou" is a staple food of northern China, where up to 70% of flour production in the region is used to make it. In South African cuisine, a number of groups produce steamed bread, such as the Zulu "ujeqe" which may be eaten alone or with tomato soup. South African steamed breads are typically made at home for consumption on the same day, but research on commercial production continues to advance, aided by earlier developments in the mass production of Chinese steamed bread. In the cuisine of the United States, one example of steamed bread is Boston brown bread, a sweet food which may be eaten as a dessert.

Zigoitia

Cigoitia (in Euskera and officially "Zigoitia") is a municipality of the province of Álava, Basque Country, Spain.
Place name.
The city´s name Cigoitia is believed to derive from the Basque expression "Zuya goitia" (upper Zuya) because it borders with the municipality and valley of Zuya at the west.
The fact that Cigoitia is higher than Zuya could be an explanation for the name "Zuya goitia". The existence of resilient historical links between both valleys also has to be validated; since Cigoitia historically belonged to Cuadrilla de Zuya.
Zigoitia is the normalized form of the town name in the Basque language, according to the actual pronunciation in that language and the modern Basque orthography. In 1995 it was adopted by the Town Council as the official municipal name. It was published by the Boletín Oficial del Estado on 13 September 1996.
In 2013 the largest common grave of the Basque Country from the Spanish Civil War was excavated in the locality.

Girolamo Genga

Girolamo Genga (c. 1476 – 11 July 1551) was an Italian painter and architect of the late Renaissance, Mannerist style.
Life and career.
Genga was born in a region near Urbino. According mainly to Giorgio Vasari's biography, by age thirteen Genga had gained an apprenticeship in Orvieto under Luca Signorelli. He was afterwards for three years with Pietro Perugino, in company with Raphael. He next worked in Florence and Siena (where he decorated the Petrucci palace c. 1508), along with Timoteo della Vite; and in the latter city he painted various compositions for Pandolfo Petrucci, a leading local statesman. 
Returning to Urbino, he was employed by Duke Guidobaldo da Montefeltro in the decorations of his palace, and showed extraordinary aptitude for theatrical adornments. He is recorded as having helped design the decorations for the Duke's funeral in 1508. From Urbino, he went to Rome and painted in the church of Santa Caterina da Siena one of his masterpieces: "The Resurrection". 
Francesco Maria I della Rovere, duke of Urbino, recalled Genga, and commissioned him to execute works in connection with his marriage to Eleonora Gonzaga in 1522. This prince being soon afterwards expelled by Pope Leo X, Genga followed him to Mantua, whence he went for a time to Pesaro; there the "Villa Imperiale" was designed by Genga for Francesco Maria and his duchess and built from c. 1530 onwards. Its sunken court is the direct precedent for the more famous one at Villa Giulia, Rome, The duke of Urbino was eventually restored to his dominions; he took Genga with him, and appointed him the ducal architect and decorator. He worked extensively on the Villa Imperiale on Mount Accio. 
Among his work in Urbino, was the scenography of plays, for example, Castiglione described the sumptuous decoration (presumably Genga's) of the performance of Bibbiena’s "La Calandria" in Urbino on 6 February 1513. He also decorated the chapel of San Martino in the cathedral.
Genga was a sculptor as well as a musician. Among his pupils were Francesco Menzocchi, Raffaellino del Colle, Agnolo Bronzino, and Dosso Dossi. His own son Bartolommeo (1518–1558) became a respected architect. There are few extant paintings by Genga. One of his leading works is in the church of S. Agostino in Cesena: a triptych in oil, representing the "Annunciation, God the Father in Glory, and the Madonna and Child". Among his architectural labors are the church of San Giovanni Battista in Pesaro; the bishop's palace at Senigallia; the façade of the cathedral of Mantua, ranking high among the productions of the 16th century; and fortifications near Pesaro.
Genga retired to a house in the vicinity of Urbino, continuing still to produce designs in pencil.

Banasur was king of Bayana city. Name of his daughter was Usha . Gurjar's were ruler kingdom of Bayana samraaj from 900–1250.
From the Muslim Conquest to the End of the Tughluq Period-
For the sultans of Delhi control of Bayana in eastern Rajasthan was a key to securing their southern territories from the local Hindu rajas. 
According to James Burgess in his book 'The Indian Antiquary' Bayana was ruled by Jadon (Yadu) Rajputs the descendants of great hindu Deity lord krishna. These rulers later on accepted Islam during the times of Firoz shah Tughlaq. These Muslim rulers of Bayana and Karouli in Bharatpur region were close to Tughlaq dynasty and were conferred the title of 'Khanzada'.

World Gathering of Young Friends

The World Gathering of Young Friends is the name of several gatherings of members of the Religious Society of Friends between the ages of 18-35. There have been two gatherings by this name; the first in 1985 in Greensboro, North Carolina, United States and the second in 2005 in Lancaster, England and Mombasa, Kenya. Though these gatherings are the first that were truly worldwide in scope, they followed many gatherings of a similar sort of Friends from North America and Europe.
1985.
The WGYF was held in 1985 in Greensboro, North Carolina, on the campus of Guilford College. 
Seen as a defining moment for the Religious Society of Friends worldwide, this gathering is generally considered to be the beginning of the thawing of many of the strained relationships which exist amongst divided theologies of Quakers around the world. Many participants and organisers went on to take up key roles of leadership in their respective Yearly Meetings. The epistle from the 1985 WGYF and the report of the process of its creation get cited in many Quaker contexts and it makes inspiring reading, whatever one's background may be.
2005.
Refused Visas.
The British government refused a large number of visas. In some cases names were given that did not match other documentation, some applications were made late, and some were made to the wrong office. It is highly debatable where the fault lies in many of these cases.

The London and North Eastern Railway Class J38 was a class of steam locomotive designed for freight work. They were designed by Nigel Gresley and introduced in 1926. A total of 35 were built and they were used in Scotland. All passed into British Railways ownership in 1948 and they were numbered 65900-65934.
The J39 was a later development, exchanging the J38's 4'8" driving wheels with larger 5'2", 289 J39s being built. Some of the J38s were later rebuilt with J39 boilers.
Preservation.
All J38s were withdrawn between 1962 and 1967, with none surviving the cutter's torch. There are plans to build a replica of an LNER J38, along with a J39, for preservation in a few years to come.

Sequence dance

Sequence dancing is a form of dance in which a preset pattern of movements is followed, usually to music which is also predetermined. Sequence dancing may include dances of many different styles. The term may include ballroom dances which move round the floor as well as line, square and circle dances.
Sequence dancing in general is much older than modern ballroom dances. With the exception of the waltz, invented around 1800, all dances in ballrooms were sequence dances until the early 20th century. After modern ballroom dancing developed, in England, sequence dancing continued. It included so-called 'Old Time' dances and also adapted versions of the new ballroom dances, and then versions of Latin dances. Sequence dancing is a competitive sport as well as a social pastime.
The British Sequence Championships is the most famous annual sequence dance competition and is part of the Blackpool Sequence Dance Festival. This is held in the Empress Ballroom, Winter Gardens, Blackpool, England, since 1949.
Sequence dancing today.
Modern sequence dancing has a repeat of the steps at every sixteenth bar, typically going on for five or six sequences in all. Specially performed sequence dance music in strict tempo is usually needed, although some 'ordinary' music may suffice provided it is played in 16 bar sections or sequences throughout. Ideally, sequence music will have a four bar introduction at the correct tempo and in the correct rhythm, followed by 5 or 6 sixteen bar sequences allowing all dancers to progress around the room and ending when the music finishes.
There are many different tempo types for sequence dancing, based on the classification of each dance. Each has an accepted speed of playing so that a typical programme of sequence dancing has a wide variety of activity. Sequence dances are split into 3 different sections; 'Old Time' – also occasionally seen as 'Old Tyme' – (now referred to as 'Classical'), 'Modern' or 'Latin' with the dividing line being somewhere in the early 20th century. New sequences are being devised all the time and the number which have been published as scripts is currently (in 2010) standing at over four thousand. 
Old-time (Classical) dances:
Old-time Waltz, Country dance, Quadrille, Galop, Polka; Saunter, Gavotte, Two Step, Mazurka, Schottische, Cakewalk.
Modern dances:
Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Quickstep
Latin-American dances:
Rumba, Cha-cha-cha, Samba, Jive, Paso Doble, Bossa Nova, Salsa, Mambo.
Regular competitions are held between dance teachers to decide which newly created sequence dances shall be 'officially' adopted and scripted for wider distribution. Most of these are tried for a short while and then disappear into the archives. Some, just a few, find great popularity and join the select group of dances which last for several years round the dance halls. Such popular dances are the basis of practically every 'Tea Dance'. Moreover, most now consider that the best dances are the older dances, and although a few clubs still teach them, interest in the new dances now seems to be rapidly diminishing.
Most people who attend these functions will recognise Saunter Together, Mayfair Quickstep, Waltz Cathrine, Rumba One and many others. An alternative to the tea dance is the 'Dance Club'. These are devoted to the teaching and learning of all the approved new sequence dances.
New Vogue.
New Vogue is a set of sequence dances which use modern ballroom technique. It was developed in Australia in the 1930s and is a danced socially and competitively across Australia and New Zealand. There are fifteen competition dances which cover March, Foxtrot, Tango and Viennese Waltz rhythms.
Sequence dance scripts.
These are written in a shorthand form similar to phone texting or knitting patterns. The jargon is easily learned and the shorthand can be understood. Ultra keen sequence dancers subscribe to the specialist dance script publishers who are authorised by the copyright holders to copy and distribute the scripts immediately they are issued by the competition organisers (the copyright holders). A short example of this dance scripting is as follows:
Social element.
Go to any sequence dance yourself and you will find that most attendees are retired persons who find it a low-cost and pleasant social occasion. They like the older tuneful melodies on which the dance music is based, and the modest exercise is good for health.
Practically all sequence dancers have a good sense of humour, and this is shown in the many self-parody leaflets which go round the dance halls in the public domain. The following poem is an example
Derek Prothero, Surrey.
Note: Humperdinck's old tune refers to 'I Had the Last Waltz With You', a 1960s hit melody.

John Duncan Fergusson

John Duncan Fergusson (9 March 1874 – 30 January 1961) was a Scottish artist, regarded as one of the major artists of the Scottish Colourists school of painting.
Early life.
Fergusson was born in Leith, Edinburgh He was the first of 4 children. Although he briefly trained as a Naval Surgeon, Fergusson soon realised that his vocation was painting and he enrolled at the Trustees Academy, an Edinburgh-based art school. He rapidly became disenchanted with the rigid teaching style, however, and elected to teach himself to paint. To this end, he began to travel to Morocco, Spain and France where he became acquainted with other artists of the day. Amongst them was Samuel Peploe, another of the group of artists who would later become identified as the Scottish Colourists.
Painting career.
Paris.
In 1898, Fergusson took his first trip to Paris to study at the Louvre. He was highly influenced by the impressionist paintings at the Salle Caillebotte and these were an important influence on his developing style. Later he would also be influenced by Fauvism and the fauvist principles of using colour would become a strong feature of his art. Andre Dunoyer de Segonzac wrote in his foreword to Fergusson's memorial exhibition of 1961: "His art is a deep and pure expression of his immense love of life. Endowed with a rare plastic feeling, almost sculptural in its quality. He joined with it an exceptional sense of colour, outspoken, ringing colours, rich and splendid in their very substance."
Fergusson became part of the enormous growth in artistic talent that Paris was home to at the beginning of the twentieth century. There he mingled with artists like Matisse and Picasso in the café society for which the city was renowned. In addition, he and his friend Samuel Peploe regularly painted together at the a seaside resort of Paris Plage and other places along the coast between 1904-9. It was at this period too that he commenced his relationship with the American illustrator Anne Estelle Rice (1879–1959), whom he encouraged to take up painting. She had been sent to Paris to provide drawings for articles on theatre, ballet, opera and race meetings published in the "North American" magazine and was to figure in many of Fergusson's canvases.
Post WWI career.
By the outbreak of World War I, Fergusson was considered to be at the forefront of modern British painting. During the war years, however, he achieved little artistically and it was only towards the end of the war that he regained the momentum in his work.
In the 1920s Fergusson was settled in a studio in London. His first solo exhibition was in 1923 and he was also involved in several important group exhibitions. In 1928 he and his partner, the dancer Margaret Morris, moved to Paris where they lived until the spectre of war once again loomed over Europe, prompting the couple to move to Glasgow in 1939 where they were to remain for the rest of their lives. A member of Glasgow Art Club, Fergusson exhibited a portrait in the club's exhibition, April 1939. 
In 1940 Fergusson founded the New Art Club, out of which emerged the New Scottish Group of painters of which he was the first president. On his death, his widow, Margaret Morris, presented fourteen of his paintings to the University of Stirling when it was founded in 1968. His work remains popular and in 1992 a permanent gallery was founded in Perth to house it.

Charles William Peach

Charles William Peach (September 30, 1800 – February 28, 1886) was a British naturalist and geologist.
Biography.
He was born at Wansford, Cambridgeshire; his father at the time was a saddler and harness-maker, and afterwards became an innkeeper, farming about eighty acres (0.32 km²) of land. He received an elementary education at Wansford and at Folkingham in Lincolnshire; and assisted for several years in the inn and farm.
In 1824 he was appointed riding officer in the HM Coastguard at Weybourne in Norfolk. Seaweeds and other marine organisms now attracted his attention, and these he zealously collected. His duties during the next few years led him to remove successively to Sheringham, Hasboro (Happisburgh), Cromer, and Cley, all in Norfolk.
In the course of his rambles he met the Rev. James Layton, curate at Catfield, who lent him books and assisted in laying the foundations of accurate knowledge. About the year 1830 he was transferred to Charmouth in Dorset, thence to Beer, and Paignton in Devon, and to Gorran Haven near Mevagissey in Cornwall.
Here he continued to pursue his zoological studies and supplied many specimens to George Johnston, who was then preparing his "History of the British Zoophytes" (1838). It was here too that he first found fossils in some of the older rocks previously regarded as not fossil-bearing; the discovery of which proved the presence of Bala Beds (Ordovician or Lower Silurian) in the neighbourhood of Gorran Haven.
In 1841 he read a paper before the British Association at Plymouth "On the Fossil Organic Remains found on the south-east coast of Cornwall", and in 1843 he brought before the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall an account of his discovery of fish remains in the Devonian slates near Polperro. Peach was transferred for a time to Fowey; and in 1849 to Scotland, first to Peterhead (1849) and then to Wick (1853), where he made acquaintance with Robert Dick of Thurso. During his stay in Peterhead he met with Hugh Miller and collected 'Buchan Flints'. He collected the old red sandstone fishes; and during a sojourn at Durness he first found fossils in the Cambrian limestone (1854). Peach was honoured with medals from the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society.
He supplied Charles R. Darwin with cirripede (barnacle) specimens collected on the Cornish coast prior to his move to Peterhead.
Later life.
Peach retired from the government service in 1861. He and his household moved to Edinburgh in May 1865 whereupon he commenced a new field of research and study into the plant fossils of the Carboniferous rocks of the area. He died at Edinburgh on 28 February 1886.
One of his sons was the geologist Ben Peach.

Kōjō no Tsuki

Japanese pianist and composer Rentarō Taki composed the music as a music lesson song without instrumental accompaniment in 1901. The song was included in the songbook for Junior High School students. The music of the song was inspired by the ruins of Oka Castle whereas the lyrics, written by Bansui Doi,were inspired by the ruins of Aoba Castle and Aizuwakamatsu Castle.
Taki's original version of the song is a B minor song, but Kosaku Yamada's slow-paced nostalgic D minor version is also popular as an accompanied song. Taki's original version of the song uses E♯ on the second bar, but the modern version usually uses E probably because the original version did not fit the traditional Japanese music.
Japanese tenor singer Yoshie Fujiwara put his singing of the song on a record in 1925. He was the first Japanese singer to popularize the song throughout the world.
A jazz arrangement was recorded by Thelonious Monk under the title "Japanese Folk Song" on his 1967 album "Straight, No Chaser".
The song was sung and recorded live in the form of a power ballad by the German heavy metal band Scorpions, during a concert at the Nakano Sun Plaza in Tokyo. It was released on their 1978 live album "Tokyo Tapes". The band's version was one of rare tracks following Taki's original version quite well. This Song was also performed by Yngwie Malmsteen during the 1984 Alcatrazz Japan Tour. A live recording of his performance at the Sun Plaza Tokyo was released on the "Metallic Live" DVD of Alcatrazz. Takeshi Terauchi & Blue Jeans, a Japanese band, did an instrumental rock cover of Kojo no Tsuki on their album "Let's Go Blue Jeans".

Hemopexin

Hemopexin (or haemopexin; HPX), also known as beta-1B-glycoprotein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "HPX" gene and belongs to hemopexin family of proteins.
Function.
Hemopexin binds heme with the highest affinity of any known protein. Its function is scavenging the heme released or lost by the turnover of heme proteins such as hemoglobin and thus protects the body from the oxidative damage that free heme can cause. In addition, hemopexin releases its bound ligand for internalisation upon interacting with a specific receptor situated on the surface of liver cells. This function of hemopexin is to preserve the body's iron.
Clinical significance.
Its levels in serum reflect how much heme is present in the blood. Therefore, low hemopexin levels indicates that there has been significant degradation of heme containing compounds and hemopexin is made to scavenge any heme it can. Low hemopexin levels are one of the diagnostic features of a hemolytic anemia.

Roberto Abbondanzieri

Roberto Carlos "Pato" Abbondanzieri (born Abbondancieri on 19 August 1972 in Bouquet, Santa Fe) is an Argentine former football goalkeeper. He spent most of his career at Boca Juniors in his homeland, as well as Getafe of La Liga and Internacional of Brazil.
Abbondanzieri won 49 caps for the Argentina national football team from 2004 to 2008, playing at two Copa America tournaments and the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Club career.
Abbondanzieri's professional debut took place on 6 December 1994 at Santa Fe's Rosario Central, with whom he would soon after win the 1995 CONMEBOL Cup. He played with the club until 1997, when he moved to Boca Juniors to be the reserve goalkeeper.
Abbondanzieri trained in the shadow of Óscar Córdoba until the Colombian goalie suffered an injury during the Clausura tournament of 1999. However, Abbondanzieri himself then suffered a shoulder injury during a match against River Plate, and the club's third-choice goalkeeper, Cristian Muñoz, took his place. When he recovered from his injury Abbondanzieri was once again Córdoba's understudy until February 2002, when Córdoba moved to Italian club Perugia.
Abbondanzieri changed his name in July 2002 from Abbondancieri, a misspelling that arose at Argentinian customs when his grandfather immigrated there, to the original spelling that he uses today. The name change was prompted by Italian citizenship concerns in the case of his transfer to the European football leagues. He was named South American Goalkeeper of the Year in 2003.
Until September 2006, when Boca achieved their third Recopa Sudamericana, he held the Boca Juniors record of 14 titles, surpassed later by Guillermo Barros Schelotto.
In July 2006, after weeks of speculation, Abbondanzieri signed a three-year contract with Spanish first division Getafe CF, claiming that "it's the right time for me to go to Europe".
On 10 April 2008 in a UEFA Cup quarterfinal second-leg match against Bayern Munich, Abbondanzieri made a vital error in extra time, as the goalkeeper failed to hold a routine ball from a distant free-kick. The ball slipped under his legs while in the six-yard box, allowing Bayern striker Luca Toni to tap the ball into the back of the net. Bayern was still in deficit of goals on aggregate, as the score was 2–3 after the goal (3–4 on aggregate), but only five minutes later Bayern would level the score at 3–3 (4–4 on aggregate) and allow themselves passage to the UEFA Cup semifinals via the away goals rule.
Abbondanzieri continued with Getafe for the first half of the 2008–2009 season, but at his request was transferred back to Boca Juniors for the 2009 Clausura tournament. "El Pato" was again Boca's number one and competed in the Clausura, although Boca only finished in 14th. He also participated in the Copa Libertadores, where Boca fell to Defensor Sporting of Uruguay in the round of 16.
On 16 February 2010 Internacional signed the Argentine goalkeeper "Pato" from Boca Juniors.
Abbondanzieri retired on 18 December after the match against Seongnam for the third place of FIFA Club World Cup. Internacional won 4–2.
On 2012, with his partner Martin Palermo take the job of managing Godoy Cruz, him as assistant manager.
International career.
As a youth, Abbondanzieri represented Argentina in the 1989 FIFA U-17 World Championship.
Since then, he became a continuous presence in Boca's goal and, in June 2004, he became the goalkeeper for the Argentine national team and has since played in the Copa América 2004 and the South American Qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
On 6 May 2006, he was named as a definite squad member for the 2006 World Cup by coach José Pekerman.
On 30 June 2006, he was injured in the World Cup quarter-finals against hosts Germany, after Argentina had taken a 1–0 lead. German striker Miroslav Klose jumped up high for a header while running and collided with Abbondanzieri, with Klose's right leg hitting the Argentinian keeper in the chest. Klose, who had looked sideways to watch for the ball in the moments leading up to the collision and thus may not have seen Abbondanzieri, received no penalty. Abbondanzieri continued at first but had to be carried off on a stretcher some minutes later, to be replaced by Leo Franco, who later failed to save Klose's equalizing strike in the 80th minute, and the four penalty kicks in the ensuing penalty shootout, which Argentina lost 2:4.
He continued to be Argentina's first choice goalkeeper under Alfio Basile following the 2006 World Cup. He played all six games in the 2007 Copa America in Venezuela as Argentina reached the final, only to lose to Brazil, 3–0. He remained Basile's goalkeeper through the early stages of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, but was forced out injured during a 1–1 draw at home to Paraguay. By the time Abbondanzieri had recovered from his injury, Basile had been replaced by Diego Maradona as Argentina's coach, and Maradona never selected him to the Argentina squad.

Eduardo Carrasco

Eduardo Guillermo Carrasco Pirard (born July 2, 1940 in Santiago) is a Chilean musician, university professor of philosophy, author, and one of the founders of the Chilean folk music group Quilapayún - and the group's musical director from 1969 to 1989.
Biography.
Carraco studied at the elite José Victorino Lastarria Lyceum in Santiago and then entered the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile to study philosophy; he subsequently travelled to Germany to study at the Ruprecht Karl Universitat of Heidelberg. In 1964 he returned to Chile to continue his study of philosophy at the University of Chile and in 1965 he forms the musical ensemble Quilapayun with his brother Julio Carrasco and his friend Julio Numhauser.
Carrasco completed his formal study of philosophy in April 1970 when he submitted a thesis on Friedrich Nietzsche; he then commenced to study music at the National Conservatorium of the University of Chile until the Chilean military coup of September 11, 1973.
The years following the military coup saw Carrasco involved primarily in artistic and political projects. After the coup Quilapayún becomes the voice of the Chilean resistance and Carrasco tours with the ensemble which performs in the venues in the world, including, Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall, the Olympia in Paris and in the Tokio Centre.
A virtuoso of the quena and wind instruments and a distinctive bass vocalist of the group. He appeared as solo vocalist in many of the groups recordings, among them “"Pregon Inicial”" of the Cantata Santa María de Iquique; "“Con el alma llena de Banderas”" of the El pueblo unido jamás sera vencido album; and ""Canción para Víctor Jara"". From the beginning he proved himself as a composer with pieces such as "“El canto del cuculi”" and "“La cueca triste”" - co-jointly with Víctor Jara – and later after acquiring formal training in the field of music he created some of the most significant work of the group, such as "“Vals de Colombes”, “Elegia al Che Guevara”, “Ausencia”" with Rodolfo Parada, "”Canción de la esperanza”" and "“Luz negra”". Carrasco forged the concept of "“La revolucion y las estrellas”/"(The revolution and the stars) which signified an evolution in the alignment of Quilapayún.
Carrasco has written numerous books including two book about Quilapayún; the first (under the pseudonym of Ignacio Santander) and the second "“Quilapayún, la Revolución y Las Estrellas.” " He has also publishing numerous works of poetry, philosophy and his conversations with the Chilean painter Roberto Matta, and with the Chilean philosopher Roberto Torretti. Once Quilapayún was able to return to Chile from exile in 1988, Carrasco maintained that the true place for the group was Chile, since other group members needed to return to France, he decided to remain in Chile and leave the group.
In Chile he has held numerous posts: as professor of philosophy at the Universidad de Chile; as director in the School of Music of the ""Sociedad Chilena del Derecho de Author"" and in the cultural division of the Chilean Ministry of Education. In 2003 Carrasco formed a Chilean based Quilapayun named "Quilapayún Histórico" (despite the fact that in France Quilapayún were still releasing new albums and touring as the group had always done whilst in exile) which included some of the original members and Ismael Oddo (the son of Willy Oddo who was assassinated in 1991). Carrasco toured extensively with "Quilapayún Histórico" and one of their concerts held on September 11, 2003 to commemorate 30th Anniversary of the death of Salvador Allende was released as a DVD titled ‘El Reencuentro’ (The Re-encounter).
Awards.
Carrasco has earned numerous award from Chile and from international organizations, including:

Frank-Walter Steinmeier

Frank-Walter Steinmeier (born 5 January 1956) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) who has served as Minister for Foreign Affairs since 2013. Steinmeier was a close aide of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, serving as Chief of Staff in the German Chancellery from 1999 to 2005. He subsequently served as Foreign Minister (2005–2009) and Vice Chancellor (2007–2009) in the grand coalition government of Angela Merkel. In 2008, he briefly served as acting chairman of his party.
Early life and education.
Steinmeier was born in Detmold as the son of a carpenter. Following his "Abitur", he served his military service from 1974 until 1976. He then studied law and political science at the Justus-Liebig-Universität of Gießen. In 1982 he passed his first and 1986 his second state examination in law. He worked as scientific assistant to the professor of public law and political science at the Gießen university, until he obtained his doctorate of law in 1991. His dissertation explored the role of the state in the prevention of homelessness.
Political career.
Early career.
Steinmeier became an adviser in 1991 for law of communication media and media guidelines in the state Chancellery of Lower Saxony in Hanover. In 1993, he became director of the personal office for the then Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, Gerhard Schröder. In 1996, he became the Undersecretary of State and Director of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony.
Steinmeier was appointed in November 1998 as undersecretary of state at the office of the chancellor following Schröder's election victory. He replaced Bodo Hombach as the head of the office of the chancellor in 1999. During this period Steinmeier was also one of the advisors to Schröder. Because of his effective management beyond the spotlight of politics, he was nicknamed "Die Graue Effizienz" (The Grey Efficiency) - a pun on "Graue Eminenz", the German for éminence grise.
A major controversy during Steinmeier's term as chief of staff was the imprisonment of a German-born Turk, Murat Kurnaz, in Guantánamo Bay from 2002 until August 2006. Steinmeier denied during a parliamentary inquiry in March 2007 that he had blocked Kurnaz's release. Instead, he claimed that Berlin had feared Kurnaz was a threat and should go to Turkey, not Germany, if released. Only after Merkel's election was Kurnaz released and brought back to Germany.
2005 elections – Foreign minister.
On 22 November 2005, after the 2005 federal elections, Steinmeier became foreign minister in the Grand coalition cabinet led by Angela Merkel. He was the first SPD Foreign Minister since Willy Brandt (1966–1969).
Following Franz Müntefering's departure from the cabinet on 21 November 2007, Steinmeier also filled the position of Vice-Chancellor. In 2007, Steienmeier said he opposes European Commission proposals on unbundling the ownership of energy networks in the European Union.
Steinmeier became known for his rather Russia-friendly stance, arguing strenuously for engagement with the increasingly assertive power to the east, rather than its isolation. Russian opposition activists thus celebrated when Steinmeier lost elections in 2009, signaling their discontent with Steinmeier. Oleg Orlov, head of the Memorial human rights group, said that Steinmeier had prolonged Schröder's policies on Russia and that Germany's policies were "extremely bad for civil society, democracy and the country as a whole".
In 2008, Steinmeier refused to meet Dalai Lama. Instead, Steinmeier issued the statement "it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the Dalai Lama these days", which the "New York Times" described as "extraordinarily cynical" and accused of Steinmeier of prioritizing money over human rights.
Steinmeier served as acting chairman of the SPD from 7 September 2008 to 18 October 2008.
2009 elections – Opposition leader.
On 7 September 2008, following the resignation of SPD chairman Kurt Beck, Steinmeier was chosen as the SPD candidate for chancellor for the 2009 federal elections and also designated as acting SPD Chairman, pending the return of Müntefering to that position.
After the SPD's decisive defeat in the elections, Steinmeier, who had been elected to represent Brandenburg an der Havel – Potsdam-Mittelmark I – Havelland III – Teltow-Fläming I, was elected as chairman of the SPD's parliamentary group in the Bundestag, and as such leader of the opposition. After a hospitalization for donating a kidney to his wife in August 2010, Steinmeier returned to his office in October 2010.
In 2011, Steinmeier criticized that Angela Merkel’s decision to appoint her economics adviser, Jens Weidmann, to be the next head of Bundesbank undermined the political independence and public trust in the German central bank. 
In late 2012, Steinmeier was once again considered a possible candidate to challenge Chancellor Angela Merkel in the 2013 general election but soon withdrew from the contest. As a consequence, SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel later announced that the leadership agreed to nominate Peer Steinbrück.
2013 elections – Foreign minister again.
After the elections of 2013 and the new grand coalition government, Steinmeier was appointed foreign minister for a second time in December 2013. He replaced Guido Westerwelle, who had signed the P5+1 accord with Iran in November 2013.
Domestically, Steinmeier has in the past been the only major politician with approval ratings consistently as high as or higher than Merkel’s. This is helped by the especially high ratings foreign ministers generally receive in Germany. 
Personal life.
Steinmeier is married and has one daughter. On 24 August 2010, due to an illness of his wife, he successfully donated a kidney to her.

Inger Christensen

Inger Christensen (16 January 1935 – 2 January 2009) was a Danish poet, novelist, essayist and editor considered the foremost Danish poetic experimentalist of her generation.
Life and work.
Born in the town of Vejle, on the eastern, Jutland coast of Denmark, Christensen's father was a tailor, her mother a cook before her marriage. After graduating from Vejle Gymnasium, she moved to Copenhagen and, later, to Århus, studying at the Teachers’ College there. She received her certificate in 1958. During this same period, Christensen began publishing poems in the journal Hvedekorn, and was guided by the noted Danish poet and critic Poul Borum (1934–1995), whom she married in 1959 and divorced in 1976.
After teaching at the College for Arts in Holbæk from 1963 to 1964, she turned to writing full-time, producing two of her major early collections, "Lys" ("Light", 1962) and "Græs" ("Grass", 1963), both examining the limits of self-knowledge and the role of language in perception. Her most acclaimed work of the 1960s, however, was "It" ("det"), which, on one level, explored social, political and aesthetic issues, but more deeply probed large philosophical questions of meaning. The work, almost incantatory in tone, opposes issues such as fear and love and power and powerlessness.
In these years Christensen also published two novels, "Evighedsmaskinen" (1964) and
"Azorno" (1967), as well as a shorter fiction on the Italian Renaissance painter Mantegna, presented from the viewpoint of various narrators (Mantegna's secretary Marsilio, the Turkish princess Farfalla, and Mantagena's young son), Det malede Værelse (1976, translated into English as "The Painted Room" by Harvill Press in 2000).
Much of Christensen's work was organized upon “systemic” structures in accordance with her belief that poetry is not truth and not even the “dream” of truth, but “is a game, maybe a tragic game—the game we play with a world that plays its own game with us.”
In the 1981 poetry collection "Alfabet", Christensen used the alphabet (from a ["apricots"] to n ["nights"]) along with the Fibonacci mathematical sequence in which the next number is the sum of the two previous ones (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34…). As she explained: "The numerical ratios exist in nature: the way a leek wraps around itself from the inside, and the head of a snowflower, are both based on this series." Her system ends on the n, suggesting many possible meanings including “n’s” significance as any whole number. As with "It", however, despite its highly structured elements this work is a poetically evocative series concerned with oppositions such as an outpouring of the joy of the world counterposed with the fears for and forces poised for its destruction.
"Sommerfugledalen" of 1991 ("", 2004) explores through the sonnet structure the fragility of life and mortality, ending in a kind of transformation.
Christensen also wrote works for children, plays, radio pieces, and numerous essays, the most notable of which were collected in her book Hemmelighedstilstanden ("The State of Secrecy") in 2000.
Awards and honors.
In 1978, she was appointed to the Royal Danish Academy; in 1994, she became a member of the Académie Européenne de Poésie ("European Academy of Poetry"); in 2001, the Akademie der Künste ("Academy of the Arts") in Berlin. She won the Grand Prix des Biennales Internationales de Poésie in 1991; She received the Rungstedlund Award in 1991. Der österreichische Staatspreis für Literature ("Austrian State Prize for European Literature") in 1994; in 1994, she won the Swedish Academy Nordic Prize, known as the 'little Nobel'; the European Poetry Prize in 1995; The America Award in 2001; the German Siegfried Unseld award in 2006; and received numerous other distinctions. Her works have been translated into several languages, and she was frequently mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in literature.

Continuous cruiser

Continuous Cruiser (CCer) is a class of licence fees on the inland waterways of the United Kingdom. It also refers to the boats and owners who have such a licence, but some people restrict this usage to boaters who "genuinely" cruise continuously (see below).
Definition of Continuous Cruising.
The licence gets its name because it applies only to boats which are "continuously cruising" on the waterway network. The reason such a classification is important (and contested) is that a boat claiming CC status need not obtain a (paid-for) home mooring. Officially-recognised moorings attract both a mooring fee and a licence fee element: a boater who is exploring the network full-time and therefore has no need of a permanent base, is not required to have a permanent mooring. With no permanent mooring to declare, they must make a binding declaration to abide by the rules for continuous cruisers.
"Real" and other Continuous Cruisers.
The Canal and River Trust (CRT) defines a continuous cruiser as a boat which is always on the move (subject to a maximum stay of 14 days in any one location) and making "reasonable progress" (limited backtracking and reasonable journey lengths) between successive moorings. Anyone genuinely touring the network has little difficulty meeting these criteria, except when travelling conditions are poor or when canals are "stopped" (and exceptions are allowed for these circumstances). Controversially, the Trust recommends that a boater who keeps a log of their trip is less likely to have problems justifying their CC credentials.
However, there are people who do not wish to move their boat far (either to avoid the cost of fuel, or to keep their boat within an area from which they can travel to work) - and yet cannot get (or do not wish to pay for) an official mooring in their area. Some of these people will risk not getting a licence altogether (and risk having their boat removed). If, however, they wish to legitimise their boat with a licence, they must claim CC status. Because of their need to make journeys long enough to justify the terms of their licence (or at least to avoid coming to the attention of local officials), but short enough to keep them near their desired location, people based in one area but with a CC licence are often referred to as "bridge-hoppers" or "continuous moorers".
History.
Prior to 1995, all boats on the canal system were required to have a permanent base for their boat, known as a home mooring. Some boaters used the system 'continuously', living on their boat as they travelled around the country, stopping in any one place for only a limited time and thus not wanting a permanent mooring. Such boaters resented having to declare a mooring, because they had to then pay a marina owner for services they had no intention of using, and therefore subsidise boaters who actually moored there. British Waterways recognised this argument in 1995 when they first allowed genuine "continuous cruisers" to apply for a licence without declaring a home mooring.
Current position.
The licence fee paid depends only on boat size. For example a 57 ft narrowboat pays £855 whether the boater declares a home mooring or not. However, someone paying for a licence but not declaring a home mooring has to sign a declaration that they will abide by the guidelines for CCing.
The Continuous Cruising Guidelines give 14 days as a maximum period for any boat to stay in any one place; the British Waterways Act 1995 section 17(3)(c)(ii) states "without remaining continuously in any one place for more than 14 days or such longer period as is reasonable in the circumstances." Examples of "reasonable circumstances" for remaining in one place for more than 14 days could include the closure of a section of canal, the canal being iced over completely, illness, bereavement or, under certain circumstances, mechanical difficulties with the boat in question.
Judicial Review.
On 23 July 2013 The Court of Appeal granted permission to Nick Brown for a Judicial Review of the Canal & River Trust’s 2011 Guidance for Boaters Without a Home Mooring. Lord Justice Jackson said in his judgement that the issue of whether the 2011 Guidance accurately sets out the powers of CRT and the restrictions on licence holders arising from Section 17 (3) (c) (ii) of the British Waterways Act 1995 merits pursuit in Judicial Review.

Asian Australians are people of Asian ancestry who are citizens or permanent residents of Australia.
For the purposes of aggregating data, the Australian Bureau of Statistics in its "Australian Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups (ASCCEG)" has grouped certain ethnic groups into certain categories, including East Asian e.g. Chinese Australian, Southeast Asian e.g. Vietnamese Australian, South Asian e.g. Indian Australian and Central Asian e.g. Afghan Australian.
At the 2011 Census 2.4 million Australians declared that they had an Asian ancestral background. This represents about 12% of all responses.
History of immigration.
Gold rush.
Early Chinese migration stemmed from the phenomenon of the Victorian gold rush. This was met with some considerable opposition due to existing sinophobia and anti-Chinese sentiment. Racial tensions escalated into several riots at Lambing Flat and Buckland. Later, entry taxes, killings and segregation in the short term and became the foundations of the White Australia policy.
Immigration restriction.
In the 1870s and 1880s, the trade union movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for "substandard" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation. Objections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas. It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the Northern Territory and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned. Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875–1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration.
Post-war immigration.
In 1972 Whitlam announced a completely non-discriminatory policy, which effectively put an end to the "White Australia Policy". This announcement occurred in the context of a reduced overall intake. During the Fraser government, with the increasing intake of Vietnamese refugees in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Australia experienced the largest intake of Asian immigrants since the arrival of the Chinese gold miners during the gold rush of the 1850s and 1860s. In 1983, the level of British immigration was below the level of Asian immigration for the first time in Australian history.
Demographics.
Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Vietnamese are the most commonly nominated Asian ancestries in Australia. Chinese Australians are 4 percent of the Australian population (2011) and Indian Australians are 2 percent of the Australian population (2011). 30% of Asians in Australia go to university, 20% of all Australian doctors are Asian, and 37% of Asian Australians take part in some form of organised sport. Second and third generation Chinese and Indian Australians are already present in large numbers. Across Australia's major cities, Asian immigration is least prominent in Perth and Brisbane (top migrant sources being England and New Zealand among other Anglosphere nations), whereas Melbourne and Sydney are far more influenced by Asian immigration. Sydney has the largest number of Asian Australians of any city, and a particularly high concentration of Chinese Australians. Chinese Australians make up Sydney's fourth largest ancestry (after English, Australian and Irish), while the Chinese, Indian and Vietnamese are among Sydney's five largest overseas-born communities.
Between the 2006 and 2011 censuses, the proportion of the Australian population born in Asia increased by one percentage point from 5 percent to 6 percent. Some suburbs have seen a sharper increase in Asian born population, where it increased by 10 percentage points.

Edward Riou

Edward Riou FRS (20 November 1762 – 2 April 1801) was an officer of the Royal Navy who served during the French Revolutionary Wars under several of the most distinguished naval officers of his age and won fame and honour for two incidents in particular.
Riou entered the navy at 12 years of age, and after a period spent in British and North American waters, served as a midshipman on Captain James Cook's third and final voyage of discovery. Rising through the ranks, he saw service on a number of the navy's stations, but also endured periods of unemployment. He received his first command in 1789, the former frigate , which was being used to transport stores and convicts to Australia. He had the misfortune to run his ship onto an iceberg, which nearly caused his ship to sink outright. After several attempts to stop the flooding into the damaged hull, most of the crew abandoned ship. Despite fully anticipating his death, Riou refused to leave his ship, and he and a few others were left to attempt the nearly impossible task of navigating the sinking ship several hundred leagues to land. After nine weeks at sea, and with continued labour and endurance, Riou successfully navigated his half-sunk ship back to port, saving the lives of those who had elected to remain with him.
His feat earned him promotions and finally commands, but a period of ill-health forced his temporary retirement from active service. Recovering quickly, he was given command of the new 38-gun , and was assigned in 1801 to Sir Hyde Parker's expedition to the Baltic. Riou worked closely with Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson during the approach to the Battle of Copenhagen, earning Nelson's trust and admiration. Nelson appointed Riou to command his frigate squadron during the battle, but when the engagement began badly for the British, Riou used his initiative to attack the Danish forts, despite being heavily outgunned. When Parker sent the signal to withdraw, Nelson ignored it and Riou felt he had no choice but to obey his commanding officer, despite his despair at what Nelson would think of retreat. As the "Amazon" swung away, she exposed her vulnerable stern to the Danish batteries. Riou was encouraging his men to the end when he was cut down by a round shot. Nelson, on learning of Riou's death, called the loss 'irreparable'. A monument was erected to his memory in St Paul's Cathedral, while a poem commemorated the loss of the 'gallant, good Riou'.
Family and early life.
Riou was born at Mount Ephraim, near Faversham, Kent, on 20 November 1762, the second son of Captain Stephen Riou of the Grenadier Guards, and his wife Dorothy. He embarked on a naval career at the age of 12, joining Sir Thomas Pye's flagship, the 90-gun at Portsmouth. His next ship was the 50-gun , flagship of Vice-Admiral John Montagu on the Newfoundland station. Riou was rated midshipman by 1776 and joined Captain Charles Clerke's for a voyage to the Pacific under Captain James Cook aboard . The expedition was Cook's third voyage of discovery, and after his death at Hawaii Clerke took command, transferring to "Resolution" and bringing Midshipman Riou with him.
Riou took and passed his lieutenant's examination on 19 October 1780, shortly after the expedition's return to Britain, and received his promotion on 28 October. His first appointment as lieutenant was to the 14-gun brig-sloop , which was sent to serve in the West Indies. Here Riou appears to have become ill, a common experience for naval officers serving in the tropics, but he survived to return to Britain and was discharged from his ship on 3 February 1782 and went into the Royal Naval Hospital at Haslar. He recovered his health and by April 1783 was back on active service, joining the Portsmouth guardship . Discharging from the "Ganges" in June 1784, he went on to half-pay, which lasted for two years until he received another appointment, this time to the 50-gun in March 1786. The "Salisbury" was the flagship of Rear-Admiral John Elliot, who sailed to Newfoundland take up his post as Commodore-Governor there. During this period in his life, Riou was described by a seaman aboard the "Ganges" as 'a strict disciplinarian with a fanatical regard for cleanliness'. He was also noted to be a religious man, and an affectionate son and brother. A further period on half-pay followed his discharge from the "Salisbury" in November 1788, but meanwhile he had succeeded in attracting the attention of the Townsend family, and was able to use their patronage to secure an appointment to command , in April 1789.
Command of the "Guardian".
The "Guardian" was a former two-decked 44-gun frigate, but had been armed "en flûte" and loaded with stores to be taken to the British colony at Botany Bay. In addition to these stores, consisting of seeds, plants, farm machinery and livestock with a total value of some £70,000, the "Guardian" was also to transport a number of convicts and their overseers. Aboard the "Guardian" was a young midshipman named Thomas Pitt, the son of politician Thomas Pitt, and nephew of Prime Minister William Pitt.
With over 300 people aboard his ship, Riou left Spithead on 8 September 1789, and had an uneventful voyage to the Cape of Good Hope where he loaded more livestock and plants. While at the Cape, Riou met Lieutenant William Bligh, who had sailed with Riou on Cook's third voyage during which Bligh had been the sailing master of "Resolution". Bligh had arrived at the Cape from Timor, where he had landed after a 3,618 mile voyage in an open boat following a mutiny aboard his ship, . After completing his re-provisioning, Riou sailed from the Cape in mid-December, and picking up the Westerlies, began the second leg of his voyage to New South Wales. On Christmas Eve, twelve days after his departure from the Cape, a large iceberg was spotted, and Riou decided to use the ice to replenish his stocks of fresh water that were quickly being depleted by the need to supply the plants and animals he was transporting.
Riou and the iceberg.
Riou positioned himself near the iceberg, and despatched boats to collect the ice. By the time the last boats had been recovered, night had fallen and a sudden fogbank descended, hiding the iceberg from view. Riou found himself in a dangerous situation. Somewhere to leeward lay a large mass of ice, concealed in the darkness and fog. He posted lookouts in the bows and rigging, and began to edge slowly forward. After sometime the danger seemed to be past, and the iceberg left behind, when at 9 o'clock a strange pale glow was reported by the lookout in the bows. Riou ordered the helm to turn hard a starboard, turning into the wind as a wall of ice higher than the ship's masts slid by along the side. It briefly appeared that the danger had been avoided, but as she passed by, the "Guardian" struck an underwater projection with a crash. Caught in a sudden gust of wind, the ship reared up and swung about, driving the stern into the ice, smashing away the rudder, shattering her stern frame and tearing a large gash in the hull. Despite the seriousness of the situation, Riou remained calm, using the sails to pull clear of the ice, and then taking stock of the damage.
Now clear of the immediate danger of the ice, Riou found himself in a desperate situation. There was two feet of water in the hold and more was rushing in, while the sea was rising and a gale had sprung up. The pumps were manned, but could not keep up with the influx of water, and by midnight there was 6 feet of water in the hold. At dawn on Christmas Day, an attempt was made to fother the hull, which involved lowering an oakum-packed studding sail over the side to cover the gash in the hull and slow the flooding. This was temporarily successful and by 11 o'clock the pumps had been able to reduce the water to a level of 19 inches. The respite was short-lived, as the sail split under the pressure of the water and the water level began to rise again. A number of seaman requested permission to take to the ship's boats. Riou convinced them to stay, but another attempt to fother the hull with another sail failed when the sail immediately ripped. By nightfall on 25 December, the water in the hold had risen to 7 feet, and the ship was rolling violently, allowing water to pour over the ship's side. Riou ordered the stores, guns and livestock to be thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten the ship, but was injured when his hand was crushed by a falling cask while trying to clear the bread-room. By morning the next day, the ship was settling by the stern, while the sails had been torn away in the gale. Again the seamen, this time joined by the convicts, requested to be allowed to take to the boats. Riou at last agreed to this, well aware that there were not enough boats for everyone, and announced 'As for me, I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to make my presence useful as long as there is any occasion for it.'
'I have determined to remain in the ship'.
While the boats were prepared, Riou wrote a letter to the Secretary to the Admiralty;
Riou gave the note to Mr Clements, the master of the "Guardian", who was given command of the launch. A total of 259 people chose to join the five boats, leaving Riou with sixty-two people; himself, three midshipmen, including Thomas Pitt, the surgeon's mate, the boatswain, carpenter, three superintendents of convicts, a daughter of one of the superintendents, thirty seamen and boys and twenty-one convicts. The "Guardian" was nearly awash by now with 16 feet of water in the hold, but a bumping noise on the deck attracted attention, and on investigation was found to be a number of casks that had broken free and were floating in the hold, trapped under the lower gundeck. Realising that this was providing extra buoyancy, Riou had the gun deck hatches sealed and caulked, while another sail was sent under the hull to control the flooding. Having now created a substitute hull out of his deck, Riou raised what little sail he could and began the long journey back to land, with the pumps being continuously manned.
For nine weeks Riou and his small crew navigated the "Guardian", by now little more than a raft, across the 400 leagues to the Cape of Good Hope. The Cape of Good Hope was sighted on 21 February 1790, and whalers were despatched from Table Bay to help the battered ship to safety. Riou ran her aground to prevent her sinking, but a gale struck the coast shortly afterwards, completing the wreck of the "Guardian". The voyage was described by J. K. Laughton in the "Dictionary of National Biography" as 'almost without parallel'. Those who remained with the "Guardian" were among the few survivors of the accident. Of the boats sent out on 25 December, only the launch with 15 people survived, having been rescued by a French merchant. The launch had witnessed the sinking of the jolly-boat, before losing contact with the two cutters and the long-boat. Riou arranged for the surviving convicts who had helped to save the ship to be pardoned for their good service.
Promotion.
Riou returned to Britain and was met with popular acclaim for his feat. Acquitted of any blame for the loss of his ship, he was promoted to master and commander on 21 September 1790, and advanced to post-captain on 4 June 1791. These promotions were for rank only, and he did not receive a command until after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Appointed to command the sixth rate in June 1793, he served in the West Indies with Sir John Jervis and was active in the operations against Guadeloupe and Martinique in 1794. He was moved to the 40-gun in November 1794, capturing a number of small French vessels before ill-health forced him to be invalided home. In the meantime, he was appointed to the yacht HMS "Princess Augusta", but his health improved and he was able to return to active service in June 1799 with an appointment to command the 38-gun . He was active against French privateers, before being assigned to Sir Hyde Parker's expedition to the Baltic in 1801 to compel the Danes to abandon the League of Armed Neutrality.
In May 1796 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society 
Riou in the Baltic.
After the British force had surveyed the Danish positions around Copenhagen, a council of war was held between Parker, his second in command Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson, and the other British captains. Riou was among those present. Riou had worked closely with Nelson and Captain Thomas Foley in the lead up to the attack, and Nelson duly appointed him commander of the frigates and smaller vessels, with the instruction to deploy his ships to support the main fleet. As the battle began, several of Nelson's ships ran aground on shoals in the harbour, and a new plan of attack had to be improvised. As Nelson's ships of the line engaged their Danish counterparts, Riou took his frigates in to harass the Tre Kroner forts and blockships. Despite being heavily outmatched and dangerously exposed, they exchanged fire for several hours. The ships suffered heavy casualties; Riou was hit on the head by a splinter.
'What will Nelson think of us?'.
At 1.15 pm Parker, waiting outside the harbour with the reserve, raised a signal ordering Nelson to withdraw. Nelson acknowledged the signal but ignored it, while Nelson's second in command, Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves repeated the signal but did not obey it. Riou now found himself in a difficult position. Too junior an officer to risk disobeying a direct order, he reluctantly gave the order for his small squadron to withdraw. In doing so his ships were forced to turn their sterns to the Danish guns, leaving themselves open to heavy fire on their most vulnerable area. The withdrawal of and then reduced the thick cloud of gun smoke that was helping to obscure the British ships, leaving the "Amazon" exposed to the full force of the Danish guns. Riou remained in action for a further half an hour before reluctantly giving the order to withdraw. Lieutenant-Colonel William Stuart, commanding the soldiers of the 48th Regiment recorded that Riou:
Command of the "Amazon" devolved to her first lieutenant, Lieutenant John Quilliam, who completed the withdrawal.
Memorials.
Nelson, who had not known him before this expedition, had conceived a great affection for Riou, and wrote 'In poor dear Riou the country has sustained an irreparable loss.' The naval historian Sir Jahleel Brenton declared that he had all the qualities of a perfect officer. Parliament commemorated his memory with a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral. The poet Thomas Campbell wrote "The Battle of the Baltic", with the lines

White Ladies Priory

White Ladies Priory (often Whiteladies Priory), once the Priory of St Leonard at Brewood, was an English priory of Augustinian canonesses, now in ruins, in Shropshire, in the parish of Boscobel, some eight miles (13 km) northwest of Wolverhampton, near Junction 3 of the M54 motorway. Dissolved in 1536, it became famous for its role in the escape of Charles II of England after the Battle of Worcester in 1651. The name 'White Ladies' refers to the canonesses who lived there and who wore white religious habits.
Origins.
The origins and exact date of foundation of the priory are not known. The surviving ruins show work typical of the late 12th century, and the first documentary evidence dates from 1186 or earlier. In it, Emma, daughter of Reynold of Pulverbatch, in the process of giving land to Haughmond Abbey mentions that she has already granted land in Beobridge to the white nuns of Brewood. In fact, it was not, and never has been, in the parish of Brewood, which is in the neighbouring part of Staffordshire, not Shropshire: Brewood was simply the nearest village of any size. The priory was outside existing parishes and manors, so its location gives no clues to the identity of the founder.
The priory acquired the church and some tithes at Montford very early in its history. So it is possible that the Lacy family or the FitzAlans, who succeeded them as holders of the manor of Montford with Forton, may have been important in its founding.
The dedication was to St. Leonard of Noblac, a saint associated with the liberation of prisoners, who was extremely popular after a number of alleged miracles earlier in the 12th century.
Building and endowments.
The church building was a simple cruciform, sandstone structure, with a nave of five bays, and a chancel of three bays. The transepts were small and without chapels. Today, the lay-out of the building is still easy to discern, although little remains of either transept, and only the north wall of the nave and chancel is fairly intact. There is a fine, round-headed Romanesque arch leading into the north transept, through which the residents would have passed to reach the cloister and the monastery. The windows on the north side are largely intact, making it easy to identify the bays of both nave and chancel. The south wall would have been windowed in the same way. It seems that the stone for the church was obtained locally – perhaps even in a field adjacent to the site, as one of the fish ponds seems to have been created from a quarry scoop.
The priory buildings are long-gone, and may have been timber-framed, but appear to have stood against the north wall of the church. Charles II commissioned a painting of the later house around 1670, and details of the painting suggest that it may have incorporated parts of the prioress' residence, which must have stood west of the main priory buildings and cloister.
The priory held many very small pieces of property, mostly donated by local families – sometimes probably as the dowries of canonesses on their admission to the community. Sometimes the gift would be fishing rights, a watermill or advowson of a parish, rather than land. By the Dissolution, there were lands, property or rights at Beckbury, Berrington, Chatwall (in Cardington), Donington, High Ercall, Humphreston (in Donington), Ingardine (in Stottesdon), Highley, Rudge, Haughton (probably in Shifnal), Sutton Maddock, and Tong, as well as Montford – all fairly local. There were also properties in Calverton, Nottinghamshire and Tibshelf, Derbyshire.
The canonesses.
The priory was occupied by canonesses regular of the Augustinian Order. Strictly, they were not nuns, but the term was used of them in the middle ages and still is. Although named after Saint Augustine of Hippo, the Rule of St. Augustine is actually a brief medieval document setting out guidelines for a religious life. It allowed its followers more access to the outside world than the stricter Benedictine Rule, and was more suited to a community involved with parish life. Many Augustinians were canons regular, who operated mainly outside the walls of a religious house, and are often confused with the Augustinian friars. As opposed to abbeys of "secular canonesses", these lived largely enclosed lives, in a manner similar to that of nuns, and the residents of White Ladies fell into this category. The priory normally supported five canonesses and a prioress, although there would also have been some lay servants.
John Leland was commissioned in 1533 by Henry VIII to investigate the libraries of religious houses in England. As part of his duties, he visited White Ladies shortly after its dissolution in 1536. He originated the false idea that White Ladies was a Cistercian house. Certainly Cistercians wore a white habit, while the color of the Augustinian habit could vary, the primary element being the wearing of a white, linen rochet, similar to that of the canons. However, the 14th century registers of the Bishop of Hereford clearly style the community "the prioress and convent of St Leonard of Brewood, of the Order of St Augustine".
Decay and dissolution.
The priory was supervised by the Bishop of Lichfield, who carried out canonical visitations. Generally the small community was found to be struggling financially, although not in debt, and it was always able to meet its own burial costs. Sometimes the conduct of the prioress was found wanting. In 1338 Bishop Northburgh criticised Prioress Alice of Harley for her financial mismanagement, her extravagant dress, and for hunting and keeping hounds. When Prioress Alice Wood retired in 1498, she was assigned the income from Tibshelf, about a fifth of the total revenues, as a pension, but Bishop Arundel required that she pay for her own food if she stayed at Brewood.
From about that date, decline seems to have set in – probably because most of the income came from leases at fixed rents in a time of inflation. In 1521 it was found that, although the priory was actually not in debt, the prioress, probably Margaret Sandford, did not know how to render account and two canonesses claimed they were still owed their monthly incomes. In 1524 the dormitory was reported to be in bad repair. In 1535, White Ladies Priory was reported to have revenues of only £31 1s. 4d. Expenses came to £13 10s. 8d, including £5 for the chaplain. The next year's figures were almost identical. This brought it well within the threshold of the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536, which dissolved all houses worth less than £200 per annum, clear of expenses.
Notice of the dissolution arrived in early 1537. Lord Stafford wanted the property, but the asking price was too high, and there were still four canonesses in residence early in 1538. By May, however, the dissolution was complete, and the site went to William Skeffington (also Skevington) of Wolverhampton on a 21-year lease.
After dissolution.
The reversion was sold to William Whorwood, the Attorney General in 1540, which made him the effective owner, but Skeffington retained the lease. It was almost certainly he who built a house on the site, probably incorporating some of the prioress's residence. When he died in 1550, it would have passed to his wife, Joan, who subsequently married Edward Giffard, son of Thomas Giffard (died 1560) of Chillington. It is unclear whether Skeffington or Joan or Giffard paid off the Whorwoods, but the property certainly became part of the Giffard family's estates. After Edward, White Ladies passed to his son, John, who extended the old farm buildings north of the priory site to create Boscobel House about 1630. In 1651, it belonged to John Giffard's daughter, Frances Cotton, at that time a widow. The Giffards were Catholics and the most important Recusants in the area. They were strong supporters of the royalist cause in the English Civil War. Their servants too were all Catholic.
White Ladies was not occupied by Frances Cotton during the escape of Charles II. It was being run by housekeepers and servants. Among the tenants of the estate were five brothers called Penderell. (There had been six but one was killed at the Battle of Edgehill.) The Penderell family were small farmers but the sons seem to have worked part of their time as woodmen, farm servants and retainers of the Giffard family, living at different places in the neighbourhood and caring for some houses such as White Ladies Priory and Boscobel House, which is about a mile away.
Charles Giffard, a cousin of Frances, escorted King Charles to White Ladies Priory early on 4 September 1651, after riding through the night after the previous day's battle. They were admitted by George Penderell, a servant of the house, who sent for Richard Penderell, who lived in a farm house nearby, and for their elder brother William, who was at Boscobel. After failing to cross the River Severn, Charles returned to the estate on 6 September and spent the day in the grounds of Boscobel House hiding in the famous Royal Oak.
Frances Cotton, née Giffard, died shortly after these events, and both White Ladies and Boscobel passed via her daughter, Jane Cotton, who had married Basil Fitzherbert in 1648, to the Fitzherbert family of Norbury Hall, Derbyshire. The house was demolished some time in the 18th century. The estate and Boscobel were sold to Walter Evans, a Derbyshire industrialist, in 1812, but the Fitzherbert family retained the White Ladies site. In 1884, the head of the Fitzherbert family became Lord Stafford, and in 1938 Edward Fitzherbert, 13th Baron Stafford placed White Ladies in the care of the Office of Works, a government department.
Whilst the priory is now gone, the remains of its medieval church and the 19th century boundary wall of the small graveyard still remain and are currently under the care of English Heritage. The graveyard was used by Catholic families until 1844, when St. Mary's church at Brewood was consecrated.

Johnny Checketts

Wing Commander John "Johnny" Milne Checketts, DSO, DFC (20 February 1912 - 21 April 2006) was a New Zealand World War II Flying ace, who destroyed 14½ enemy aircraft, had three probables and damaged 11. He was shot–down twice – once over the English Channel, when he was rescued from the sea by the Royal Navy, and once over occupied France, when he was returned to the United Kingdom by the French Resistance.
Early life.
Checketts was born in Invercargill on 20 February 1912 and was educated at the Invercargill South School and Southland Technical College, where he studied Engineering before undertaking an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic.
World War 2.
Checketts joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force in October 1940, at the age of 28. He graduated from his flying course in June 1941 as a Pilot Officer and was posted to the United Kingdom. After converting to Spitfires, Checketts joined 485(NZ) Squadron in November 1941. On 12 February 1942 the unit took part in operations over the English Channel during the German "Operation Cerberus", when the German battleships "Scharnhorst and "Gneisenau made a high–speed dash from Brest to reach safety in German ports.
On 4 May 1942, Checketts was shot down – he bailed out over the channel and was eventual rescued from his dinghy by the Royal Navy. In June 1942 he was posted to Sailor Malan's gunnery school before continuing to 611 Squadron based at Biggin Hill in January 1943. Checketts was promoted to Flight Lieutenant and given command of A Flight in April. On 30 May 1943 he shot down a Fw 190 south–east of Trouville, Seine-Maritime. 
In July, Checketts was promoted to Squadron Leader and returned to 485 Squadron at Biggin Hill as commander. On 15 July he shot down a Fw 190, on the 27th he destroyed two more, and on the 31st a Bf 109G. Guiding the unit over Saint-Pol on 9 August 1943, Checketts led a section against eight Bf 109s and destroyed three of them. The other three New Zealand pilots in the section each destroyed one and Checketts damaged one of the two remaining 109s as it escaped. For this action he was awarded the DFC. 
While acting as high cover for bombers attacking an airfield near Amiens on 19 August the Squadron was jumped by a force of FW 190s and Bf 109s. In a running battle Checketts probably destroyed an Fw 190 and damaged another.
Shot down over France.
On 6 September 1943, 485 Squadron flew high cover for Martin B-26 Marauders bombing the rail marshaling yards at Serqueux, Seine-Maritime. The Spitfires were attacked by twenty Fw 190s from above. Checketts shot one down but was then attacked by several others and his aircraft was set on fire. 
Burned and wounded, he struggled to bail out. On landing he was approached by a French boy who helped him on to his bicycle and then wheeled him to nearby woods. The next day he was taken by a Frenchman to his own home, where his injuries were tended by the Frenchman's wife. 
Having been passed from one house to the next by the French Resistance, Checketts eventually met another 485 pilot, Sergeant Kearins, who had been shot down on 15 July. They were joined by a group of 11 other escapees and taken across the channel in a fishing boat on 21 October 1943. 
Checketts was then posted to the fighter wing of the Central Gunnery School as an instructor.
Promotions.
In April 1944 he was given command of 1 Squadron equipped with the Hawker Typhoon fighter–bomber. After six weeks was promoted to Wing Commander to lead 142 Spitfire Wing at RAF Horne which was an Advanced Landing Ground in Surrey. He later led this wing from Westhampnett, Merston and Manston. On 27 August, he was leading 303 Squadron as escort of Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers on their way to attack an oil refinery near Düsseldorf. Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket fighters of "Jagdgeschwader" 400 were scrambled to intercept the bombers and were engaged by 303 Squadron. Checketts was attacked by an Me 163S but managed to evade it.
His last operation with 142 Wing was on the day his leadership of it ended - 26 September 1944. While flying as high escort cover over Arnhem, he shared in the destruction of a Bf 109 with one of his flight commanders. 
In 1945 Checketts was appointed Wing Commander Tactics at the Central Fighter Establishment. He had been awarded the DFC on 13 August 1943, the DSO in December 1943, US Silver Star in August 1944 and the Polish Cross of Valour in April 1945.
Postwar career.
After the war he returned to the RNZAF, and became Station Commander of RNZAF stations Wigram, Lauthala Bay (Fiji) and Taieri (Dunedin). Checketts was appointed officer commanding 75 Squadron in 1951 and at Ohakea was responsible for introducing the de Havilland Vampire to form the RNZAF's first jet squadron.
In 1955, he left the RNZAF to start an aerial topdressing company. This lasted until 1958 when became a salesman of agricultural chemicals.
Checketts died at Christchurch on 21 April 2006, aged 94.
Quotation.
On war: "It is destructive. Everything about it is to destroy, and I don't think human beings are brought into this world to destroy things. They are brought into the world to preserve."

Samuel Martin (Secretary to the Treasury)

Samuel Martin (1 September 1714 – 20 November 1788) was a British politician and administrator.
Family.
He was the son of Samuel Martin, the leading plantation owner on the West Indies island of Antigua, where he was born, and eldest half-brother of Sir Henry Martin, 1st Baronet (1733–1794), for many years naval commissioner at Portsmouth and Comptroller of the Navy as well as father of Thomas Byam Martin. Another half-brother was Josiah Martin (1737–1786) governor of North Carolina from 1771. His full-sister Henrietta (Rilla) Fitzgerald was the mother of poet William Thomas Fitzgerald and mother-in-law of equity lawyer John Fonblanque KC MP for Camelford 1802-1806. Martin's will seems to reveal the existence of the mother of his natural child or children.
Parliament.
Martin sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Cornish borough of Camelford from 1747 until 1768. He was a protégé of an important British politician, Henry Bilson Legge, who was three times Chancellor of the Exchequer. When Legge was first made Chancellor, Martin served as his secretary from April 1754 until November 1755.
Martin, although he lacked major political talents and was mistrusted by Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, had a capacity for hard work and dealing with administration. This led to his being appointed Secretary to the Treasury for the first time in November 1756, during Legge's second Chancellorship. This was a post which was more administrative than political in nature, although Martin was an MP and the appointment was a patronage one. In April 1757 he left office, with his political allies led by William Pitt the Elder.
When Legge was restored to the Chancellorship for the third time in July 1757, Martin was the only person who had gone out of office in April who was not given a new job in the Pitt-Newcastle Coalition. Having failed to obtain an office in the King's service, Martin was compensated by being appointed Treasurer to the Princess Dowager of Wales Augusta of Saxe-Gotha (mother of the future King George III of the United Kingdom) in October 1757. He retained that office until 8 February 1772. In 1760 King George III succeeded to the throne. Martin was able in the following year to transfer his political loyalty from Legge (who was becoming less prominent in public life) to the King's favourite John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute.
In April 1758 Martin became Secretary to the Treasury for the second time. He continued in that office until April 1763. After leaving the Treasury in 1763, Martin largely withdrew from public life. He declined to seek re-election to Parliament in 1768, unless the government paid all his election expenses. Although this proposal was not agreed, he returned again for Hastings until 1774.
Duel with John Wilkes.
The Times of Wednesday 26 November 1788 reported: "Last week died Samuel Martin Esq
This pistol duel took place in Hyde Park on 16 November 1763. John Wilkes was severely wounded in the stomach, ultimately fled to Paris and was pronounced an outlaw.

<doc id="2897350" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2897350" title="Gunung Leuser National Park">
Gunung Leuser National Park

Gunung Leuser National Park is a national park covering 7,927 km² in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, straddling the border of North Sumatra and Aceh provinces. The national park, settled in the Barisan mountain range, is named after Mount Leuser (3,381 m), and protects a wide range of ecosystems. An orangutan sanctuary of Bukit Lawang is located inside the park. Together with Bukit Barisan Selatan and Kerinci Seblat national parks it forms a World Heritage Site, Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra.
Geography.
Gunung Leuser National Park is 150 km long, over 100 km wide and is mostly mountainous. 40% of the park, which is mainly in the north, is steep, and over 1,500 m. 12% of the park only, in the lower southern half, is below 600 metres but for 25 km runs down the coast. 11 peaks are over 2,700 m and the highest point is Gunung Leuser, which 3,466 m high.
Ecology.
Gunung Leuser National Park is one of the two remaining habitats for Sumatran Orangutans ("Pongo abelii"). In 1971, Herman Rijksen established the Ketambe Research Station, a specially designated research area for the orangutan. Other mammals found in the park are the Sumatran elephant, Sumatran tiger, Sumatran rhinoceros, siamang, mainland serow, sambar deer and leopard cat.
After researchers put 28 camera-traps in July 2011, 6 months later the researchers found one male and six females and predicted the population is not more than 27 Sumatran rhinos which total population predicted is around 200 in Sumatra and Malaysia, a half population of 15 years ago.
Water supply.
The first signs of reduced water replenishment have already been seen in and around the Leuser Ecosystem. Groundwater reservoirs are rapidly being exhausted and several rivers fall completely dry during part of the year. This has severe consequences for the local community. Both households and industries need to anticipate water shortages and higher costs for water.
Fishery.
Coastal fisheries and aquaculture in and around Leuser are very important. They provide a large portion of the animal protein in local people’s diets and generate ample foreign exchange. Their annual value currently exceeds US $171 million. If the Leuser Ecosystem is degraded, the decline in fresh water may have a detrimental impact on the functioning of the fishery sector.
Flood and drought prevention.
Flooding generally becomes more frequent and more destructive as a result of converting forests to other uses. Annual storm flows from a secondary forest are about threefold higher than from a similar-sized primary forest catchment area (Kramer
et al., 1995). In Aceh, local farmers have reported an increasing frequency of drought and damaging floods due to degradation of the watercatchment area. In May 1998, over 5,000 ha of intensive rice growing areas were taken out of
active production. This was the result of the failure of 29 irrigation schemes due to a water shortage. Furthermore, floods in December 2000 cost the lives of at least 190 people and left 660,000 people homeless. This cost the Aceh province almost US $90 million in losses (Jakarta Post, 2000a). Logging companies are slowly recognising their role in increased flooding and have made large donations to support the victims (Jakarta Post, 2000b).
Agriculture and plantations.
Agriculture is a major source of income for the local communities around Leuser. Large rubber and oil palm plantations in northern Sumatra play a major role in the national economy. Almost all remaining lowland forest has been given out officially for oil palm plantations. Yield decline has been recorded, however, in several Leuser regencies. This decline can be ascribed mainly to a deterioration of nutrients in the soil, along with soil erosion, drought and floods, and an increase in weeds. Clearly, these causes of decline are linked to the deforestation of Leuser. For example, the logging of water-catchment areas in Leuser is found to be responsible for taking 94% of failed irrigation areas out of production (BZD, 2000a).
Hydro-electricity.
Several regencies, such as Aceh Tenggara, have hydro-electricity plants that use water from Leuser. The plants operated in Aceh Tenggara are designed as small-scale economic activities. It appears that the operational conditions for the hydro-plants have worsened in recent years. Increased erosion of the waterways has forced the operators to remove excessive sediments from their turbines. This has led to frequent interruption of the power supply, higher operational costs and damage to the blades of the turbines. One plant closed down due to lack of water supply. Most of these disturbances are considered abnormal and may therefore be attributed to deforestation.
Tourism.
Low-impact eco-tourism can be one of the most important sustainable, non-consumptive uses of Leuser, thereby giving local communities powerful incentives for conservation. Given the opportunities to view wildlife such as orang-utans, some experts view eco-tourism as a major potential source of revenue for communities living around Leuser (van Schaik, 1999).
Biodiversity.
People living in areas with a high biodiversity value tend to be relatively poor. Hence, the highest economic values for biodiversity are likely to be found within institutions and people in wealthy countries. Funds can come from several sources, including bio-prospecting, the GEF and grants from international NGOs (with donations possibly being proportional to biodiversity value) (Wind and Legg, 2000).
Carbon sequestration.
Anthropogenic increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases (such as CO2) in the atmosphere are widely believed to lead to climate change. Carbon sequestration by rainforest ecosystems therefore has an economic value, since the carbon fixed in the ecosystem reduces atmospheric concentrations.
Fire prevention.
To what extent does primary rainforest have a fire prevention function, and thus an additional value for preventing economic damage? There are various factors that make disturbed forest more prone to fires than primary forests. The likelihood that a forest will burn depends on the level of fire hazard and fire risk: 
(1) fire hazard is a measure of the amount, type and dryness of potential fuel in the forest. Logged forest has relatively large amount of dry logging wastes lying around; 
(2) Fire risk is a measure of the probability that the fuel will ignite. In the presence of abandoned logging roads, which provide easy access to otherwise remote forests, the fire risk is greatly increased when settlers use fire for land clearance.
Non-timber forest products.
NTFP can provide local communities with cash as long as exploitation does not surpass a threshold level.
Threats.
In November 1995, the Langkat Regency government proposed a road to connect an old enclave, known as Sapo Padang, inside the park. In pursuit of business opportunities, 34 families who had been living in the enclave formed a cooperative in March 1996 and subsequently submitted a proposal to develop an oil palm plantation in August 1997. The oil palm proposal was accepted by the regency and the head of the park agreed to the road construction.
In accordance to the government's Poverty Alleviation Program, the oil palm project proceeded with 42.5 km² of clearance area, but the project caused major forest destruction in the park during its implementation. The local cooperation unit formed a partnership with PT Amal Tani, which has strong relationship with the military command in the area. In January 1998, the Indonesian Forest Ministry granted a permission of 11 km road to be built. In June 1998, local office of the Forestry Service issued a decree stating that the Sapo Padang enclave was no longer legally a part of the national park, a controversial decision which consequently led to further forest destruction during the road construction and invited newcomers to slash and burn forest area to create local plantations a way deeper to the park.
In 1999, two university-based NGOs filed a legal suit to the Medan State Court, while a group of 61 lawyers brought a parallel case in the National Administrative Court. In July 1999, the National Administrative Court rejected the case, while the local NGOs won with 30 million rupiahs damage, but the legal process continues with appeals. The legal process did not stop the project that extensive logging and clearing, road-building and oil palm plantation continue operating inside the national park.
2011 reports the pressures on locals from palm oil profits has led to illegal slash and burning of 21,000 hectares per year. 
Relocations.
In December 2010, 26 families comprising 84 people were moved from Gunung Leuser National Park area to Musi Banyuasin, South Sumatra. There are thousands of people who inhabit the park illegally, and the Indonesian government plans to move them. Many of the inhabitants are refugees from the violence and disasters in Aceh.

<doc id="2897395" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2897395" title="Riksråd">
Riksråd

Rigsraadet, or Riksrådet, (English "The Council of the Realm" or "The Council of the State" – sometimes translated as "Privy Council"), is the name of the councils of the Scandinavian countries that ruled the countries together with the kings from late Middle Ages to the 17th century. Norway had a Council of the Realm ("Riksrådet") that was abolished by the Danish-Norwegian king in 1536. In Sweden the parallel Council gradually came under the influence of the king during the 17th century.
Rigsraadet in Denmark.
The members of the Council of Denmark seem to have developed from being councillors of the king to being representatives of the magnates and noblemen. From the 1320s it clearly appears as a force, and from the 1440s it was the permanent opponent of royal power, replacing the Danehof.
The Council consisted of noblemen who were appointed either by the king or their peers on the Council. Until the 1536 Reformation, bishops were automatically members. So were the supreme officials (today the “cabinet ministers”) while lower ranking “ministers” did not have any formal right to membership. The “backbenchers” of the council took part in daily negotiations of problems and administration, voted, and took on diplomatic tasks. Most of them were squires who also had to look after their lands.
As a whole, it was the role of the Council to rule together with the king, to control him, and to manage the affairs of State well. The councillors were seen as a guarantee towards the nobility (and in theory also towards “the people”) that everything was done right. The Council took over the rule in the space that appeared by a succession or at interregna. It led negotiations over the creation of a new haandfæstning, and in theory it also had to call for a rebellion against kings who did not keep their promises, a right that was used in 1523. However in the 16th century, it was not quite unusual that the councillors to some degree identified with the State rejecting too extravagant demands from the Danish gentry. The background of this normally was that they themselves represented the Danish answer to the peerage.
The number of councillors was not laid down. Normally it was about 20, but from time to time deaths might reduce their number wherefore it was supplied by mass creations. Not until 1648 was the number of councillors finally fixed to 23.
The authority of the council was indisputable, and within some limits the kings also tried to co-operate. However most of the kings neglected some of the rules and, for instance, foreign questions presented many loopholes. The many military defeats of the 17th century and especially growing economic problems and conservatism of the nobility also weakened the prestige of the Council, and the king gradually tried to strengthen his own influence. At the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660, the Council was abolished.
The word ”Rigsråd” was revived in Denmark in the 19th century. During 1854–1866 it was used about a special federal council dealing with all common legislative questions of Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein, and from 1863 of Denmark and Schleswig alone. It had hardly anything else in common with its old namesake other than the title. The loss of Schleswig in 1864 made it redundant, and it was abolished by the new constitution two years later.
Riksrådet in Norway.
The Norwegian Riksråd gradually emerged around 1300, evolving from the King's council. It emerged clearly as a power factor after 1319, during the minority of king Magnus VII Eriksson. There doesn't seem to have been any clear rules for how many members the council should have, or who should be councillors. During the 15th century, the number could be from 30 to 40, whereas after 1500 it was barely above 10. The Norwegian bishops were automatically members. There was at the time five bishops in mainland Norway (the archbishop in Trondheim, the bishops in Oslo, Hamar, Stavanger, Bergen), plus one in the Faroe Islands, two on Iceland, one in Greenland, and one in Orkney (lost to Scotland in 1468). The bishops from the islands rarely participated in the Norwegian riksråd. In addition, the chaplains of the royal chapels in Oslo and Bergen were permanent members. So were the commanders of the five strongest castles of Norway: Bohus, Akershus in Oslo, the castles in Bergen, Tønsberg and Trondheim. The rest of the council was recruited from the Norwegian nobility. Only Norwegians were eligible for these places in the Norwegian Riksråd – however, this was also taken to include foreigners who had married a Norwegian. As several of the bishops and commanders of the castles were foreign – mostly Danish, but also some Swedish and German – the number of Norwegians in the Norwegian Riksråd gradually diminished. The archbishop of Trondheim mostly acted as the head of the council.
As Norway had of old been a hereditary kingdom, the Norwegian Riksråd's task did not, originally include the election of the king, as in Sweden and Denmark. However, as successive kings died without leaving any issue, starting with Olav IV in 1387, it fell to the Riksråd to interpret the succession laws. This it did so freely that Norway more and more became, in reality, an elected monarchy, like its Nordic neighbours. This was formally affirmed in 1450, when Christian I of Denmark took the Norwegian throne as an elected monarch. On his death, in 1481, the Riksråd ruled the country for two years, in an interregnum, before electing Christian's son as the new king – a period which could be seen as the height of the council's power.
In the early 16th century, the power of the Norwegian council diminished. The Danish union kings conducted a policy of strengthening their own power at the cost of the nobility, and the Norwegian nobility was too weak to put up a strong opposition. In addition, the few Norwegian noble families became more and more intermarried with the Danish nobility, giving them less of an interest in maintaining separate Norwegian structures. During the troubled transition to the reign of king Christian III, the Norwegian archbishop led a rebellion in support of Christian's rival to the throne. After Christian had won, he proclaimed that the Norwegian Riksråd was abolished, in 1536. The archbishop went into exile, the Protestant reformation was carried through in Denmark and Norway, and the Norwegian Riksråd never assembled again.
Riksrådet in Sweden.
The Riksråd was the upper parliamentary house in Sweden populated by the nobility. The Swedish nobility often played a prominent role in Swedish history, it both helped and hindered the nation. Sten Sture of the Riksråd led the resistance against the Danish dominated Union of Kalmar until he was killed alongside other nobles during the Stockholm bloodbath in 1520. Gustav Vasa took over and successfully restored Swedish sovereignty in 1523.
Over the next two centuries the Monarchy and the Riksrad were constant rivals. When Gustavus Adolphus was crowned in 1594 the Riksrad drafted the charter of Nyköping which took many of the king's powers. During Queen Christina of Sweden's reign a large proportion of crown land was alienated (given to nobles) which led to major financial instability in Sweden. 
King Charles XI was Sweden's first absolute monarch who led an immense 'reduction' policy (the retrieval of land from the nobility) in 1654 1.5% of land was the crown's and 72% belonged to the noblitiy. by 1700, 35.5% of land belonged to the crown and 33% belonged to the nobility.
This continued until the end of the Swedish absolutists in 1718 when Charles XII was killed during the Great Northern War.
The Privy Council, Riksråd, officially was the ruling body of Sweden until 1974.

Christopher John "Chris" McCann (born 21 July 1987) is an Irish footballer who plays for Wigan Athletic as a midfielder. A graduate of the youth system at Home Farm, McCann joined Burnley as a teenager, making his first team debut in 2005. He went on to make over 200 appearances for the club before joining Wigan Athletic on a free transfer in 2013. He has also won one cap for the Republic of Ireland U19 team.
Club career.
Burnley.
McCann was born in Dublin, County Dublin. Brought over to Lancashire from the Irish club Home Farm, McCann progressed through the youth system at Burnley, and made his senior debut in the 2005–06 season, coming onto the pitch as an early substitute in the 4–0 win against Coventry City on 13 August 2005.
McCann scored his first senior goal on 27 September 2005, in the 3–0 win against Ipswich Town.
He started the 2006–07 season in the first-team squad, but reverted to the substitutes' bench after a few games as he sought to confirm his potential at Championship level. However, injuries saw him pressed into action as an emergency left-back and he took these opportunities – re-establishing himself in the first-team line-up. In 2008–09, McCann was linked with a possible move to a Premier League club. McCann began his debut Barclays Premier League season well, but an unfortunate knee injury and subsequent surgery to his cruciate following the game against Sunderland at Turf Moor in September sidelined the midfielder until December 2009 at the earliest. In his second match back from injury, he picked up a second injury that ruled him out for the rest of the season.
Following Burnley's relegation from the Premier League McCann returned to the team and played in Burnley's first three pre-season friendlies against Bury, Oldham Athletic and the first game of Burnley's tour of Singapore in which McCann was taken off with a knee injury. McCann played no further part in Burnley's pre-season and in the week before the Clarets season opener against Nottingham Forest, news broke that the midfielder was a doubt for this game and would be sent to see a specialist. McCann returned to Championship action while being named captain of Burnley FC by manager Eddie Howe. On 26 June 2013, McCann agreed to join Wigan Athletic following the expiry of his contract with Burnley at the end of the month. He will be reunited with former Burnley manager Owen Coyle.
International career.
McCann has represented the Republic of Ireland at under-17, under-18 and under-19 level. He was first called up to the Republic of Ireland U21s for the matches against Montenegro and Bulgaria on 16 and 20 November 2007 for the 2009 European U21 Championship qualifiers. On the wake of his call-up Ireland U21 manager, Don Givens, stated that "Chris has been involved with Ireland at other age levels but this is his first call-up to the Under-21 panel. He is a good player and deserves a chance at this level". He was selected in the squad for the 1–0 defeat to Montenegro in Podgorica. However he had to withdraw due to an injury. This was unexpected news as he has played the week before against Preston North End after he had missed three games with a groin injury. McCann was again named on the bench for the second match against Bulgaria but opted out of the squad two hours prior to kick-off claiming it was a waste of his time being there. Don Givens criticised McCann saying, "I can never understand anybody that doesn't want to pull on the green shirt". He also added that this event could hinder McCann's future international career, "Will I pick him again? Would you?". Ireland went onto win the match in Athlone regardless of McCann's actions through a 90th minute winner from the Watford midfielder John-Joe O'Toole. However, Givens later apologised for his criticism, "I take it back, its nice to see Chris developing into a player of true class" Despite smoothing things over with Givens he was never called up to the under-21s again. Since that event McCann has stated his desire to play for the full national side and hoped that his form for his club side could push him into Giovanni Trappatoni's squad.
