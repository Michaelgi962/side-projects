Billy Fitchford

William Henry "Billy" Fitchford (1892 – 13 April 1966) was an English footballer and cricketer. An inside-left, he scored 14 goals in 98 league and cup games in nine years at Port Vale from 1914 to 1923, and later spent time with Glossop, Congleton Town, Stoke and Northern Nomads. He played Minor Counties Championship cricket for Staffordshire from 1922 to 1928.
Playing career.
Fitchford was an amateur with a good footballing brain playing for Porthill St. Andrew's when he was signed to Port Vale in March 1914. After serving as a Lieutenant in the First World War he finally made his debut for the club on 23 November 1918, being the only scorer for Vale in a 4–1 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor. He struggled to be given permission to miss work from his banking job to play in matches so was not played as often as he could have been. He played 19 Second Division games in the 1919–20 season, claiming goals against Nottingham Forest and Birmingham at The Old Recreation Ground. He also managed to score the only goal of the Staffordshire Senior Cup final against Birmingham on 15 May 1920.

He scored three goals in six league games in the 1921–22 season, getting on the scoresheet against Hull City, Leicester City, and Blackpool. He also was a part of the side that shared the North Staffordshire Infirmary Cup in 1922. He made 19 league appearances and played one FA Cup game in the 1922–23 season, without scoring a goal. He was released at the end of the season, and went on to play for Glossop, Congleton Town, Stoke and Northern Nomads.

Mauri people

Mauri (from which derives the English term "Moors") was the Latin designation for those ancient Berber peoples and tribal confederation inhabiting the territory of modern Algeria and Morocco, Roman Mauretania, west of Numidia. 
The Latin name is an adoption of the name "Mauroi" (Μαῦροι) in Greek ethnography.
Much of that territory was annexed to the Roman Empire in 44 AD, as the province of Mauretania, later divided into Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Tingitana. Groups of "Mauri" continued to inhabit the desert regions south of the Roman borderland.
The name "Mauri" was applied to people of the entire region. "They were called Maurisi by the Greeks", wrote Strabo, "and Mauri by the Romans." 
The Mauri were trading partners of Carthage. During the Second Punic War between Carthage and Rome, two Mauri Numidian kings took different sides, Syphax with Carthage, Masinissa with the Romans, decisively so at Zama. 
Thereafter, the Mauri entered into treaties with Rome. King Jugurtha responded to violence against merchants with war. Juba, a later king, was a friend of Rome. Eventually, the Roman Empire incorporated the region as the provinces of Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Tingitana. The area around Carthage was already part of the province of Africa. Roman rule was effective enough so that these provinces became integrated into the empire. 
During the Christian era, two prominent Berber churchmen were Tertullian and St. Augustine. After the fall of Rome, the Germanic kingdom of the Vandals ruled much of the area. 
Neither Vandal nor Byzantine could extend effective rule; the interior remained under Mauri Berber control. For more than 50 years, the Berbers of Algeria resisted Arab armies from the east. Among its memorable resistance were the forces led by the Berber Muslim king Aksel in 680 AD and the Christian queen Dihya she was the Berber priestess of the Aures during 690–701. And by 710 CE, or the 92nd lunar year after the "Hijra", Berbers of north Africa had become Muslims and then the Arab Muslims dominated North Africa under the Islamic empire of Umayyad Caliphate.

Valiathura

Valiathura is a suburb of Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, India. This was once the only port along the South Kerala coast. When Kochi became the prominent port in Kerala, Valiyathura lost its significance as a major port. Now Valiathura is considered as a fishing port.
Geography.
It is located at , near Shankhumugham. It is a typical coastal region. The vegetation consists mainly of coconut trees. The land is higher in Valiathura, so calamities due to the monsoon tides are less compared to the other nearby coastal regions.
History.
Valiyathura was known as Raithura or Rajathura from the time of Travancore Kingdom. but the history goes beyond; from the time of King Solomon Valiyathura port was active and used to export spices and articles. the Saint Antony's Cathedral has the history of more than 500 years and the New Year day celebration started more than 120 years. At the battle between Marthanda Varma and Ettuveetil Pillai, one of the pillai and his soldiers were protected by the fisher people of Valiyathura and some of those people married a few Valiyathura girls and settled in Valiyathura.
Valiathura Pier.
Valiathura is famous for its pier. The 51-year-old, pier and the godowns (warehouses) behind it are a far cry from the past, when up to 50 cargo ships used to call here at a time. Opened in 1956 by the advisor to the Rajapramukh Dr. P.S. Rau, it was the only port along the South Kerala coast.
Supported by 127 concrete piles, the pier had four 3-tonne cranes and one 10-tonner to unload cargo from the ships. Since the pier was located in shallow waters, heavy ships had to anchor in the deep sea and transport their ware in smaller boats. With the development of the Kochi port with facilities for berthing of huge cargo ships, Valiathura lost its significance. It was declared a 'dead port' in the early 1980s.
All five cranes were dismantled and sold as scrap as disuse and constant exposure to salty winds eroded their structure. The four godowns were rented out to industrial units on the Veli belt. The rails used by trolleys to transport cargo to the godowns have rusted away. 
The pier which consumed 571 tonnes of cement and 250 tonnes of steel, cost about Rs.10 lakhs (Rs. one million) to build. Till today, the fishermen along the coast use the weakened structure to launch their catamarans during the rough monsoon months, when the rough sea makes the beaches inaccessible. They then jump into the sea and swim to the catamarans. 
Waves here very rarely fall below one metre, and often exceed four metres during the monsoon period of May to October.
There are many anglers who occupy strategic points on the pier, holding on to their line patiently waiting to hook a fish. Avoiding sophisticated angling gear, these people use their hands to hold the line instead of the angling rod. The anglers here are mostly labourers and daily-wage workers. 
The hooks range from 18 to 24 on a single line. There are also hooks that do not need any bait on them. But these should be regularly pulled and loosened in the water in order to attract prey. As the water current is towards the shore, the anglers need something to take the line down to the waters. For this, they use iron weights attached to the line, which provides the thrust while the line is thrown into the sea.
Malavu, a fish that visits the coastline occasionally from inland waters, is another temptation for the anglers. "para", "kanava" and "kozhiyala" are among the other visitors that swim into the trap.
A few years ago, one of the weakened piles on the right head of the 51-year-old pier developed a crack leading to the collapse of a platform measuring about . And on July 8, a portion of the sidewall gave in to the powerful waves lashing the structure and plunged into the sea.
Currently visitors are prohibited from going out on Valiathura pier. In 2007, the Harbour Engineering Department announced a project for its reconstruction.
St. Antony’s Forane Church.
St. Antony’s Forane Church Valiathura was established in 1530 by the Franciscan Missionaries. Valiathura the port city of the ancient Travancore has more than seven centuries of Christian heritage. In the 13th century Pope Innocent IV sent a few Franciscan and Dominican missionaries to Kollam, Mampally and Valiathura to proclaim the gospel.
The geographical boundary of Valiathura Parish till the beginning of 20th century extended from Shangumugham to Beemapally in the south. Later, the parish was bifurcated for administrative convenience. Consequently the parishes of St. Ann’s Church Valiathope; Assumption Church Cheriyathura; St. Xaviers Church Valiathura and finally Fatima Matha Church Kochuthope came into existence. The famous pilgrim center Madre de deus church vettukad is part of Valiathura Forane.
Pigrim Centre.
Madre De Deus Church Vettukad, is the major pilgrim centre coming under Valiathura Forane.
Location.
Valiathura is 5 km from the city centre. Privately owned and KSRTC buses ply from East Fort. Autorickshaws can also be hired.
A bypass of National Highway 47 passes 1 km to the east of Valiathura. The nearest railway station is Thiruvananthapuram Central, around 8 km away.
Shangumugham Beach and Beemapally mosque are tourist attractions nearby.
Economy.
Fishing was the main livelihood for the people of Sea shore. But most people work abroad like Srilanka, Burma, Malaysia, Maldives, Singapore, Persian and Middle East Countries. Many hundreds of youth of Valiyathura joined the Indian Army, Air Force, Navy, ISRO, VSSC, Travancore Titanium Products Ltd. Indian Airport Authority, Banks, Schools and many Government and Private owned organizations. Many Medical Doctors, Pilots, Scientist, Respective Police officers and Politicians and Social workers are born and raised up in Valiyathura.
Educational Institutions.
Educational institutions in Valiathura are St. Antony's Higher Secondary School, St. Antony's Lower Primary School, Government Regional Fisheries High School, Government UP School and Government LP School. also there are more than eight private educational institutes serving the students.
People and Culture.
People of Valiyathura are mainly Christians from the various denominations like Latin Catholics, Roman Catholics,Syrian Catholics, CSI and a few number of Pentecostals, Hindus and Muslims are minorities.
The People of Valiyathura trace back their history more than 500 years. Many Valiyathura people are from the background of Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish and English, whom can be identified with their surnames such as Pereira, Culas, Fernandez, Neto , Lopez, etc. Also Ettuveetil Pilla was also having their generations in Valiyathura. 
Valiyathura was the most civilized Coastal Area from the time of Travancore Kingdom.

Able UK

Able UK is a British based company specialising in the rehabilitation and development of disused sites and facilities, demolition, site reclamation, re-mediation, regeneration and waste disposal. ABLE also owns and operates the largest purpose-designed facility for recycling redundant marine structures including ships.
Ship decommissioning.
Able is involved in the decommissioning of a wide range of marine structures. The Teesside Environmental Reclamation and Recycling Centre (TERRC) at Able Seaton Port in Hartlepool on the River Tees.has been used for the recycling of both ships and oil rig platforms and jackets http://www.ableuk.com/operations/marine-decomission/
TERRC was the yard selected by both the French and US Governments to recycle the former French aircraft carrier, Le Clemenceau and vessels from the US MARAD fleet respectively. The facility, including one of the world’s largest dry docks, has full planning permissions and environmental accreditations to undertake this type of activity. The previous contracts were completed in October 2010 and employed over 250 personnel.
In January 2014 Able confirmed that it was one of 12 facilities seeking to win the contract to dismantle the Costa Concordia.
Port Operations.
Able operates a number of ports on the River Tees and on the Humber is developing Able Humber Port http://www.ableuk.com/sites/
Able Humber Port (AHP) is situated on the South bank of the Humber Estuary, East Coast of the UK, which in recent years has been the UK’s fastest growing port and logistics centre. http://www.ableuk.com/sites/port-sites/humber-port/
It consists of ABLE Marine Energy Park (AMEP) and ABLE Logistics Park (ALP) and is Europe’s largest new port development providing an exciting proposal for the burgeoning marine renewable energy sector and a variety of port centric logistics functions.
UK Government has identified AHP as a strategic location in the National Renewable Infrastructure Plan and HMG UK Treasury has since confirmed AMEP as the UK’s largest Enterprise Zone now eligible for 100% enhanced capital allowances.
In December 2013 the Secretary of State for Transported authorised the granting of a Development Consent Order for Able Marine Energy Park - a 900 acre development with 1,300m of new deep water quays (up to -17m CD) http://www.ableuk.com/sites/port-sites/humber-port/amep/ AMEP is set to transform the local economy http://www.ableuk.com/energy-park-decision-will-transform-future-of-the-humber-says-able-chief/
Able Logistics Park (ALP) offers a further 497.5 hectares (1,229.5 acres) site with full planning permission in place for the creation of extensive warehousing (1,700,000m² ), external storage and transportation depots. http://www.ableuk.com/sites/land-sites/able-logistics-park/
On the river Tees Able Seaton Port covers 51 hectares (126 acres) including a 10 hectare (25 acre) dry dock – one of the world’s largest.
It is capable of handling all types of offshore construction vessels, has significant crane capacity and quays, which have been constructed particularly to suit the requirements of the heavy fabrication industry.
Quays 10 & 11 are some of the strongest in Europe at 306m long (up to -15m CD). They can be dredged to -15m chart datum and are designed with a quay loading capacity of 40T/m² with a heavy load-out pad area capable of 60T/m². http://www.ableuk.com/sites/port-sites/seaton-port/
Other port related sites include: Able Middlesbrough Port - the former Davy/SLP fabrication yard http://www.ableuk.com/sites/port-sites/middlesbrough-port/ ; Billingham Reach Industrial Estate http://www.ableuk.com/sites/port-sites/billingham-port/ ; Able Clarence Port http://www.ableuk.com/sites/port-sites/clarence-port/ and Able South Tees http://www.ableuk.com/sites/port-sites/south-tees/
Dry Dock.
The ABLE dry dock facility at ABLE Seaton Port (ASP) is one of the largest in the world. Through an on-going investment programme of circa £50m ABLE has re-established ASP as a facility of strategic national significance.
The dry dock offers a unique proposition to oil and gas rig operators. In addition to ASP offering wet berthing and servicing, the dry docks sheer size means it can also offer full dry dock servicing to the largest rigs, platforms and heavy lift vessels currently operating in the North Sea.
Currently the dry dock is 376m long and 233m wide with an entrance width of 120m. A multi-million pound upgrade of the dry dock to include a new wider concrete caisson dry dock gate and the creation of a new inner dock area will enable the yard to expand its service offering and provide greater flexibility to tackle large complex projects. http://www.ableuk.com/operations/dry-dock/

London Press Club

The Press Club was established in 1882 as a London gentlemen's club. For much of its history, it occupied premises in Wine Office Court, near Fleet Street. It still exists today, as a society for journalists, but no longer offers club facilities, which ended with its leaving Wine Office Court in 1986.
It was founded with an inaugural dinner at Anderton's Hotel, on Fleet Street, on 22 October 1882, presided over by the prominent journalist and cartoonist George Augustus Sala. The club is a founder member of the European Federation of Press Clubs. It has traditionally been considered much less formal, and even quite raucous, compared to most traditional London gentlemen's clubs - as exemplified by the club being the first to do away with a requirement for gentlemen to wear ties, in the early 1960s.
Notable members have included Lord Beaverbrook, John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever and the showbusiness journalist Peter Dacre.

Monford Orloff

Monford Arthur Orloff (March 29, 1914 - February 13, 2000) was an American businessman, financier, lawyer and philanthropist. He was married to Janice Orloff and had three children Jon, Carole and Chester. Orloff was known as an aggressive supporter of the arts.
Career.
Born in Omaha, Nebraska, he grew up in Nebraska and New York and completed high school in Vancouver, British Columbia. He graduated from Stanford University in 1937 and was elected Phi Beta Kappa, in 1940 he graduated with a J.D. from Harvard Law School. He served in the U.S. Army in World War II first as an infantry officer then in intelligence. 
In 1951 he settled in Bellingham, Washington and began practicing law there. In 1952, Mt Baker Plywood, one of his clients, was facing bankruptcy. Orloff signed on as general manager and successfully turned the company around.
In 1959 he bought the Aberdeen Plywood Co., in Aberdeen, Washington. As the CEO of Aberdeen Plywood and Veneers Inc. he orchestrated a merger with Plymouth, Michigan based Evans Products in 1961. He became president of Evans moving the corporate headquarters to Portland, Oregon. Under Orloff's leadership the company developed a combination of retail building materials stores, building and wood products, railcar and trailer manufacturing, heavy equipment leasing and home building and financing. 
In 1972, he resigned. Two years later, due to interest rate increases and cuts in housing starts bringing massive losses to Evans (the company saw its stock fall from $13 a share to $2 a share) Orloff returned to his post. He cut many of the company's money-losing sectors, bringing confidence back to his investors. In 1979, Evans' share price rebounded and the company produced $1.5 billion in annual sales.
Evans Products was taken over by Victor Posner in 1983 and Orloff stayed on as a consultant until 1985 at which time he became Chairman of FEI Corporation in Hillsboro, Oregon.
Philanthropy and boards.
Orloff donated generously to the arts and higher learning including $3 million to the Oregon Community Foundation for a performing arts center. He sat on the boards of the Oregon Community foundation, Reed College, OPB Foundation, the Oregon Symphony, the Portland Art Museum, the Oregon Art Institute, and Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI) board. As president of the Oregon Community Foundation, he vigorously supported the foundation's program to fund undergraduate and community college scholarships for Oregon and Clark County, Washington high school graduates.

Josep Torras i Bages

Josep Torras i Bages (), born at Les Cabanyes, Alt Penedès, on 12 September 1846 - died at Vic, Osona, on 7 February 1916) was a Catalan thinker, writer and bishop. He was one of the main figures in the turn of the 20th century Catholic Catalan nationalism.
Biography.
Torras and the Catalan traditions.
Josep Torras strongly criticized the secularism displayed by the "militant nationalism" of Enric Prat de la Riba (1870–1917). In 1892 he wrote "La tradició catalana", where he emphasized Conservative Nationalism and warned against the erosion of Christian values. Exalting rural life, the family, religion and the love of Catalan language, the land and the language took an almost mystical dimension in his point of view.
He was convinced that the Catalan nation had to be Christian in order to establish itself as something enduring and meaningful in the future, his words ""Catalunya serà cristiana o no serà"" (Catalonia will be Christian or will not be) are engraved at the gate of Santa Maria de Montserrat abbey.
Torras was very interested in the study of the seny, a virtue often considered a Catalan cultural symbol, and encouraged others, like Josep Abril i Virgili and Jaume Raventós, to do so.
Based on good sense and wisdom, "seny" was perceived by Torras to originate in the traditional Catalan rural farm ("casa pairal" or "masia"). The life in the traditional non-urban setting with its frugality, hard work and religious piety was the right ground for the development of the values and social norms embodied in the Catalan "seny".
Ecclesiastical work.
In 1882 Torras became counselor of bishop of Barcelona J. M. Urquinaona. Specializing in conflict-solving among Catholics, he also was the censor of some newspapers that were compromised in certain inner troubles (procesos canónicos) of the Spanish Church at the time.
Years later, in 1888, Josep Torras, after analyzing the growing secularization of Spanish society, had written the book "El clero en la vida social moderna" in Spanish. In his work he wrote straightforwardly about the often integrist or reactionary position of the Catholic Church in Spain, and sought to encourage the Spanish Catholic clergy to adapt to the spirit of the times and to focus on moderation and personal spiritual discipline, an advice that went largely unheeded at the time. 
Torras was promoted to become archbishop of Burgos in 1906 and Valencia in 1913, but he declined because he didn't want to put a distance between himself and the mission he was committed to in the heart of Catalonia.
Works.
Even though most of his works have been published in compilations under the title "Obres completes", his abundant correspondence, crucial for the understanding of certain issues surrounding Catalan nationalism, remains for the most part unpublished.

Montagne del Morrone

The Montagne del Morrone are a mountain group in Abruzzo, central Italy, part of the Apennines. Overlooking the town of Sulmona, they are bounded by the Valle Peligna, the river Aterno and the Majella massif. They are included into the Majella National Park.
The range is composed of limestone, and have their highest peak in the Monte Morrone (2,061 m).
Vegetation include typical Apennine woods of beech and mountain pine, as well as the rare orchid species "Nigritella widderi". Wildlife include Marsican brown bear, italian wolf, mouflon, red deer, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, Eurasian eagle-owl and Ursini's viper. Until the early 20th century, the bearded vulture was also present.
On a terrace of Mount Morrone are the remains of a Roman villa which allegedly belonged to the poet Ovid, which have been recently recognized as a sanctuary of Hercules Curinus. Here it was found a small statue of Hercules resting, considered by some an original by Lysippos (now in the Archaeological Museum of Chieti). Nearby are is the 13th century Morronese Abbey. In the mountain are also two caves in which future Pope Celestine V lived his hermitage from 1239 and 1241.

The Party (play)

The Party is a play by the British dramatist, actor and director Jane Arden (1927–82) which was first staged at the New Theatre, London on 28 May 1958. The play was directed by Charles Laughton and starred, in addition to Laughton himself, Albert Finney, Laughton's wife Elsa Lanchester, Ann Lynn, Joyce Redman, and John Welch. Following generally enthusiastic reviews "The Party" ran for six months at the New Theatre and has occasionally been performed in repertory since.
"The Party", which is set in Kilburn, is significant for a number of reasons. It was Laughton's final appearance on the London stage, despite being the first time he had acted in England since 1951. It was also the first appearance on the London stage by Albert Finney who Laughton had seen playing Macbeth in Birmingham.
The play is also a significant early work by Arden, who by that time had already written for television and the theatre. "The Party" is, like much of Arden's other work for theatre, cinema and television, ground-breaking and innovative, in this case mainly for its daring exploration of mental illness and its effects on family dynamics. As Simon Callow, in his book "Charles Laughton: A Difficult Actor" (Methuen, 1987) says, 'The play actually anticipates a great deal of mid-sixties drama on the subject of society's imposition of conformity.' There are also disturbing intimations of an incestuous relationship between the central character Ettie and her father Richard but, due to the moral climate and censorship restrictions of the 1950s, Arden could not explore this theme openly.
Despite its comparative success there are some commentators who think that Laughton largely misjudged the play in both his staging and casting. Curiously, no television or film version of "The Party" has ever been planned and this perhaps accounts partly for the play's relative obscurity in comparison with other contemporary works such as "Look Back In Anger" and "A Taste of Honey".
"The Party" was published by Samuel French Limited

Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism

The Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) is an executive directorate of the Home Office, created in 2007, responsible for leading the work on counter-terrorism in the UK, working closely with the police and security services. The office reports to the Home Secretary (currently Theresa May) and Minister of State for Security and Counter-Terrorism (currently Baroness Neville-Jones). Its current Director General is Charles Farr, who is described as the senior government official responsible for counter terrorist and organised crime strategy.
Responsibilities.
According to its website, the current responsibilities of the OSCT are:
In May 2014, the Director General of OSCT made a witness statement on behalf of the government and the three main intelligence agencies for the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, in a legal case brought by advocacy groups including Privacy International, Liberty and Amnesty International, explaining the legal basis for the interception of electronic communications under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This was characterised in the media as an explanation of how the security services can legally monitor "Facebook, Google and Twitter" usage by UK citizens.
Programmes.
The Preventing Violent Extremism strategy (Prevent), a £140 million programme run by OSCT, was criticised in 2009 by Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, as a domestic spying programme collecting intelligence about the beliefs of British Muslims not involved in criminal activity. The Communities and Local Government Committee was also critical of the Prevent programme in 2010, stating that it stigmatised and alienated Muslims the government wanted to work with.
In 2013 OSCT stated that 500 people had gone through its Channel deradicalisation programme, including some considering participating in the Syrian civil war, steering some away from violent extremism.

Mount Sen

Outline.
Mount Sen is the easternmost mountain, which is taller than 1000 m in Chugoku Mountains. Mount Sen is a typical fault-block mountain in this area.
On the name of Mount Sen, there are two explanations. One is because it has thousands of peaks (in Japanese ‘sen’ means thousand), however judging from the shape of the mountain, this explanation can not be believed. The other explanation is because the mountain is a mountain for Xian. In Japanese, Xian(仙) is pronounced ‘sen’.
Route.
There are three major routes to the top of this mountain. Mitani route and Iwazashin route start from Kadokura Bus Stop of Shinki Bus. It takes about two and half hours. The other route, Ichinara route is from Tanji Bus Stop, it takes about three hours.

Eurasian eagle-owl in Great Britain

The Eurasian Eagle-owl was not considered to be naturally resident in Britain, however there is evidence it was Native to the UK some time ago. According to a BBC TV programme (2005), a pair bred for several years in a valley in Ministry of Defence land in North Yorkshire. There was some debate as to whether these birds were escapees or whether they have arrived naturally from the continent, which would only be a short journey from either France, the Low Countries or Scandinavia. At the time the program was made, they had reared 20 young to independence, and three young were in the nest. Nothing was known of what happened to those 20 young, except that one of them electrocuted itself on power lines in Shropshire. 
Another bird has been sighted several times in Heaton, Bolton, Greater Manchester. This bird was reported to have died in mid April 2007 due to secondary poisoning, perhaps from eating a contaminated dead rodent.
The BBC reported a pair nesting and aggressively protecting their brood from dog-walkers on a nearby footpath in Lancashire, England, in late May 2007.
However, a more recent BBC TV programme (2007) reported that the Eagle Owl is becoming more common in the UK and is showing signs that it is becoming established, mirroring the recent rapid increase in the Buzzard population with which it shares some similarities, particularly prey and habitat.
The recent apparent increase in successful wild-breeding has attracted opposition from those who believe the owl to be a danger to native species and young livestock. Perhaps as a result, a few 'new' Eagle Owls have been illegally killed, including the female in North Yorkshire that had successfully reared 23 young, who was shot dead in January 2006. This act was condemned as "disgraceful" by the World Owl Trust.
A new pair in the Forest of Bowland, Lancashire, have been attracting public attention due to having successfully reared three young to flight. There have also been reports of a further two pairs active in the local area as well as another pair breeding chicks in Northumberland in 2005.
Eagle Owls have also been confirmed breeding in Scotland, with sightings of wild birds confirmed in Galloway, Invernesshire, and Sutherland. The World Owl Trust now believes that the Eagle Owl should be added to the British Ornithologists Union's list of official British birds - indicating the significance of the increase in wild pairs in Britain.

They began to menace Ernest out of the wages he had been preparing. Mike began to wonder what was taking so long and opened the door, knocking Ed, causing him to shoot Ernest, who later died in hospital.
Ed returned in 2006. He befriended Emily Bishop at church and began dating Eileen Grimshaw. Ed divulged to Emily his prison background and subsequently revealed that he was responsible for the death of Emily's husband Ernest. Emily expressed her disgust at this revelation and born again Christian Ed dramatically contemplated suicide, but Emily forgave him when he asked her for forgiveness. She gave him Ernest's old camera, and made him promise to send her Christmas card, with a photograph of himself every year to show her he was alive and well. With that Ed left Weatherfield.
Ida Clough.

In 1980 Ida went head to head with Ivy Tilsley to become The union leader,but she lost out to Ivy. When Mike Baldwin was charged with drink driving in 1988 it had been Ida who had reported him and Mike sacked her. Ida returned to the street for Ivy's funeral in 1995 and Mike Baldwin agreed to take her back at the factory. This time she was working alongside Janice Battersby and Sally Webster. In 1997 when the Duckworths decided to renew their wedding vows in Las Vegas, Vera suggested they fly Ida out as a witness. Ida made her last appearance in Coronation Street in 1998.

At the time of Gail got pregnant with Sarah, she was sleeping with Brian and his cousin, Ian Latimer, and was unsure if Brian is Sarah's father, although a blood test later revealed that he was. Gail refused to tell Brian until Audrey let the truth slip during an argument with Brian's mother, Ivy. Brian adjusted to Gail's infidelity but did not reconcile with Gail for some time; he briefly abducted Nick when a break-up looked likely. Ivy always believed that Ian was Sarah's father.
Brian and Gail eventually divorced, but got back together for the sake of their children, and married again in February 1988. The marriage didn't last and, on 15 February 1989, Brian was stabbed to death whilst protecting a woman from some youths outside a nightclub. Nick was deeply affected by his death, and, as a teenager, was shocked by an accidental meeting with Darren Whateley the man who had killed his father.

Siege of Weinsberg

Siege of Weinsberg, within the then-Holy Roman Empire, was a decisive battle between Welfs and Hohenstaufen. During it the Welfs for the first time changed their war cry 'Kyrie Eleison' for their party cries. The Hohenstaufen used the 'Strike for Gibbelins' war cry.
On the death of Lothar II in 1137, the Welf Henry the Proud, heir of the patrimony of his deceased father-in-law, and possessor of the crown jewels, stood boldly forward as a candidate for the imperial dignity. But the local princes, opposing him, elected the Hohenstaufen Conrad III in Frankfurt, on February 2, 1138. When Conrad gave the Duchy of Saxony to Count Albert the Bear, the Saxons rose in defence of their young prince, and Count Welf of Altorf, the brother of Henry the Proud, began the war.
Exasperated at the heroic defence of Welfs, Conrad III had resolved to destroy Weinsberg and imprison its defenders. 
He however suspended the last assault, after negotiating a surrender which granted the women the right to leave with whatever they could carry on their shoulders. The women eschewed their possessions, and carried their husbands on their shoulders! When the king saw what was happening he laughed and accepted the women's clever trick, saying that a king should always stand by his word. This became known as the "Loyal Wives of Weinsberg" ("Treue Weiber von Weinsberg") episode. The castle ruins are today known as "Weibertreu" ("wifely loyalty") in commemoration of the event.

Great Mosque of Maarrat al-Numan

The Great Mosque of Maarrat al-Numan () is an Ayyubid-era mosque in the village of Maarrat al-Numan between Hama and Aleppo in Syria. This congregational mosque was built in the first half of the twelfth century.
History.
Ma'arat al-Nu'man developed as a major caravan stop on the north-south corridor between Aleppo and Damascus and later became an Arab stronghold on the eastern side of the Orontes valley opposite the western string of Crusader castles. The mosque signified a rapidly growing site of political and geographical importance. All that remains of the mosque today is the square minaret that bears a close resemblance -in form and ornamentation- to the minaret of the Great Mosque of Aleppo. The architect Hassan Ben Mukri al-Sarman, built the mosque in Ma'arat al-Nu'man to rival the Great Mosque in Aleppo. In 1099, however, during the Crusader siege of Ma'arat al-Nu'man a massacre of 20,000 of its residents severely diminished the town's aspirations of further development.

Pangonius

Pangonius is a genus within the horse-fly family (Tabanidae), sometimes misspelled as "Pangonia".
In culture.
The zimb, also known as ' (Ethiopian) or ' (Arabic), is any horse-fly of the genus "Pangonius" found in Ethiopia. The genus is more widespread and contains many species, but only those from this region are given the name "zimb". They are similar in feeding habits to the tsetse fly but completely unrelated. They are large, and destructive to livestock; though its bite is painful, it is not venomous.
The zimb was first described in Western literature by James Bruce, who wrote of the creature:As soon as this plague appears, and their buzzing is heard, all the cattle forsake their food, and run wildly about the plain, till they die, worn out with fatigue, fright, and hunger. No remedy remains but to leave the black earth, and hasten down to the sands of Atbara; and there they remain, while the rains last, this cruel enemy not daring to pursue them further. Though his size be immense, as is his strength, and his body covered with a thick skin, defended with strong hair, yet even the camel is not capable of sustaining the violent punctures the fly makes with his pointed proboscis. When once attacked by this fly, his body, head, and legs, break out into large bosses, which swell, break, and putrefy, to the certain destruction of the creature. Even the elephant and rhinoceros, which, by reason of their enormous bulk, and the vast quantity of food and water they daily need, cannot shift to desert and dry places, as the season may require, are obliged to roll themselves in mud and mire; which, when dry, coats them over like armor, and enables them to stand their ground against this winged assassin.

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (album)

E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is an audiobook and soundtrack album for the 1982 blockbuster film of the same name directed by Steven Spielberg. Narrated by American recording artist Michael Jackson, the album was produced by composer Quincy Jones and distributed by MCA Records. The production of the audiobook brought Jackson together with several former collaborators, such as Rod Temperton, Freddy DeMann, and Bruce Swedien.
The "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" audiobook was released on November 7, 1982—the same month as Jackson's acclaimed sixth studio album "Thriller". Subsequent court action taken by the pop star's record label, Epic Records, forced its withdrawal. During its curtailed release, "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" reached number 82 on the UK Albums Chart. It was well-received critically and won Jackson a Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children.
Content.
The "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" album package contains a storybook, which allows listeners to read along with Jackson as he narrates the tale of E.T. and the alien's visit to planet Earth. The book contains a photograph of E.T. placing hands on Jackson's shoulders, while one of the extraterrestrial's fingers glows. This picture is included in the album package as a × full-color poster. The 20-page storybook include stills from the movie and the lyrics to the song "Someone in the Dark" (written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman), which Jackson sings on the audiobook. The recording, on a 12-inch vinyl LP, features original music by John Williams, integrated sound effects from the movie, as well as the voice of E.T. in the background.
Background.
Prior to the recording of the "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" album, Jackson released four solo studio albums with Motown Records ("Got to Be There", "Ben", "Music & Me" and "Forever, Michael"), and several with his brothers as part of The Jackson 5. In 1975, he moved to Epic Records and in 1979 released "Off the Wall", to critical and commercial success.
In June 1982, the Steven Spielberg–directed science fiction film "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" was released. Created by Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures (then a subsidiary of MCA Inc.), it starred Henry Thomas, Dee Wallace, Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore and Peter Coyote. The film tells the story of Elliott, a boy who befriends a good-natured extraterrestrial called E.T., who is stranded on Earth. Upon its release, the film became a blockbuster and surpassed "" to become the highest-grossing film released to that point. Critics lauded it as a timeless story of friendship, and the American Film Institute ranks it as the third greatest science fiction film ever produced in the United States.
Production.
Jackson began work on the audiobook of "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" in June 1982—around the same time he began recording his sixth studio album "Thriller". Quincy Jones served as the producer for both projects, in addition to working as the narrative writer for the audiobook. During the recording of the narration, Jackson became so upset when E.T. died that he wept. Jones and Spielberg both felt that trying to record the part again would not change the pop star's emotional reaction, and decided to leave Jackson's crying in the finished recording. Jackson biographer Lisa D. Campbell wrote that Jones had learned this during the recording of "She's Out of My Life" (from the "Off the Wall" album), where the singer also broke down in tears.
Several of the contributors to the "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" storybook album had worked with Jackson on his solo projects in the past. Rod Temperton, who had written several songs featured on "Off the Wall" and "Thriller", wrote the music for "Someone in the Dark". Freddy DeMann and Ron Weisner, former managers of The Jacksons, served as the production coordinators for the album. Bruce Swedien engineered "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", a task he had performed on "Off the Wall" and "Thriller" and would go on to perform for the albums "Bad" (1987) and "Dangerous" (1991). Dick Zimmerman photographed Jackson for the "Thriller" album cover, before again capturing the singer for the accompanying poster to the "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" album.
Once the recording and engineering aspects of production had been completed, MCA Records (the distributor of the album) pressed more than 1 million copies of the audiobook. In 1982, a journalist for "Billboard" wrote that it was one of the "most ambitious" projects that MCA Records had taken on to date.
Jackson's empathy with the E.T. character.
According to the biography "Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness", written by journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli, the pop singer had shown an early attachment to the story of E.T. After a publicity photo shoot for the soundtrack album in which an animatronic robot of the extraterrestrial character hugged Jackson, the singer stated with wonderment, "He was so real that I was talking to him. I kissed him before I left. The next day, I missed him." Jackson later revealed in the December 1982 issue of "Ebony" magazine—in which both he and E.T. appear on the cover—that he felt he actually was the creature during the album recording and shared his thoughts on why he had such a strong connection to the character:
"He's in a strange place and wants to be accepted—which is a situation that I have found myself in many times when travelling from city to city all over the world. He's most comfortable with children, and I have a great love for kids. He gives love and wants love in return, which is me. And he has that super power which lets him lift off and fly whenever he wants to get away from things on Earth, and I can identify with that. He and I are alike in many ways"
Release and legal issues.
Epic Records allowed Jackson to record the album for MCA Records on two conditions:
The conditions were breached by MCA Records, which released the storybook in November 1982 and gave 7-inch promo copies of "Someone In the Dark" to radio stations. After Epic lodged a $2 million lawsuit, MCA Records were forced to withdraw the album and prohibited from releasing "Someone In the Dark" as a single. Epic executives had felt that MCA were misleading members of the public into believing that the then-recently released single "The Girl Is Mine" was featured on the storybook album. The plaintiffs further requested that MCA Records be banned from working with Jackson in the future and that any other media owned by MCA featuring the singer be prohibited from release.
As a result of the legal restrictions that prohibited the public release of "Someone In the Dark" as a single, the promo copies which were made have since become one of the singer's rarest and most sought-after records; some have been sold for over £1000 ($1587). The song was later included as a bonus track on the 2001 special edition of "Thriller", as well as the box set "Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection".
Reception.
"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" was a commercial success; it reached number 82 on the UK Albums Chart, which was considered high for a storybook album. The audiobook won Jackson a Grammy Award in 1984 for Best Recording for Children. Upon collecting the award and taking home a record eight Grammys from an unprecedented twelve nominations, the singer stated that of all the awards had received that night, he was "most proud of this one".
"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" was also well-received critically. Charles L Sanders of "Ebony" magazine described it as an "extraordinary album". Mark Bego of the "Toledo Blade" asserted that the song "Someone in the Dark" was "one of the most beautiful ballads" that Jackson had ever recorded. He further commented that the
amalgamation of Jones' production, dialogue from the film, Jackson's "effective and emotional" reading of the narrative and the audiobook's "grand soaring orchestration" made the "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" album " as many tears as the movie does". A writer for "Billboard" described the audiobook as being "lavishly packaged, lovingly produced" and worth its high asking price. A journalist for the "Lexington Herald-Leader" concluded that it was a "delightful" storybook album.

Falsifiers of History

Falsifiers of History (Historical Survey) (""Falsifiers"") is a book published by the Soviet Information Bureau, edited and partially re-written by Joseph Stalin, in response to documents made public in January 1948 regarding German–Soviet relations before and after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.
Background on "Nazi–Soviet Relations" documents.
In 1948, the U.S. State Department published a collection of documents titled "Nazi–Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office", which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of Nazi Germany. The collection included documents from, and about conversations with, Soviet officials during negotiations regarding the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a 1939 agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany, along with the related 1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement. It also included publication of the "Secret Additional Protocol" of that Pact, which divided eastern Europe into "spheres of influence" between Germany and the Soviet Union, executed weeks before each country's subsequent invasion of Poland. The collection further contained "Secret Supplementary Protocols" to agreements between the countries, discussions regarding the 1940 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement, discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming an Axis Power and other German–Soviet negotiations and discussions.
Publication.
"Falsifiers" was published in response to the documents made public in "Nazi–Soviet Relations". Joseph Stalin became personally involved in editing the work after receiving a translation of the "Nazi–Soviet Relations" document collection. On February 3, 1948, Stalin was presented with a typescript titled "Reply to Slanderers". Stalin changed the title to "Falsifiers of History (Historical Reports)". Stalin personally edited the book, including striking and re-writing whole sections by handwritten modification.
"Falsifiers" originally appeared as a series of articles in "Pravda" in February 1948. It was subsequently published in numerous languages and distributed worldwide. Separately, the Soviet Union later published a collection of documents it captured from German archives titled "Documents and Materials Relating to the Eve of the Second World War".
Themes and issues.
"Falsifiers" pointedly ignored Soviet relations with Germany, making no attempt to directly counter or deal with the documents published in "Nazi–Soviet Relations". Rather, the main theme of the booklet is Western culpability for the outbreak of war in 1939. It argues that "Western powers" aided Nazi rearmament and aggression, including that American bankers and industrialists provided capital for the growth of German war industries, while deliberately encouraging Hitler to expand eastward. It depicted the Soviet Union as striving to negotiate a collective security against Hitler, while being thwarted by double-dealing Anglo–French appeasers who, despite appearances, had no intention of a Soviet alliance and were secretly negotiating with Berlin.
"Falsifiers" casts the Munich agreement, not just as Anglo–French short-sightedness or cowardice, but as a "secret" agreement that was a "a highly important phase in their policy aimed at goading the Hitlerite aggressors against the Soviet Union." "Falsifiers" also included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's offer to divide the world, without mentioning the Soviet counteroffer to Germany's offer to the Soviets to join the Axis. The parties never reached agreement on Axis entry. Stalin's account in "Falsifiers" was repeated in Soviet historical texts until the Soviet Union's dissolution. Regarding Soviet–German relations after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, "Falsifiers" main theme frames Soviet actions as a legitimate attempt to build up an "Eastern front" to defend against inevitable Nazi aggression.
"Falisifiers" characterization of Western policy as anti-Communist, anti-Soviet, and pro-Nazi had been a prominent theme of Soviet propaganda before the Second World War, and such rhetoric more vigorously reemerged during the Cold War.
Importance.
Soviet publications before the revelation of documents in "Nazi–Soviet Relations" had avoided discussing the Soviet–German pact. Accordingly, "Falsifiers" is novel because it is a first frank Soviet discussion of the German–Soviet pact in a publication. In addition, because "Falsifiers" was personally and extensively edited by Stalin, at the very least, it provides unique insight into the view of events that he was keen to publicize.
The book provides insight into Stalin's thinking and calculations in the autumn of 1940. In analyzing the text of "Falsifiers" surrounding Soviet–German talks regarding the potential entry as the Soviet Union as an Axis Power, historian Geoffrey Roberts argues that there is no reason that Stalin would not have signed a four-power pact if Germany accepted his November offer.
Some accusations made by Stalin in this book are however today supported by western historians, in particular the role played by France and England in the failure of a tripartite alliance with USSR before 1940.

Dermatosis neglecta

Dermatosis neglecta is a skin condition in which accumulation of sebum, keratin, sweat, dirt and debris leads to a localized patch of skin discoloration or a wart-like plaque. It is caused by inadequate hygiene of a certain body part, usually due to some form of disability or a condition that is associated with pain or increased sensitivity to touch (hyperesthesia) or immobility.
Dermatosis neglecta typically develops several months after a disability or other affliction leads to improper cleaning. Patients may deny that negligence is the cause of the lesion, even though it completely resolves on vigorous rubbing with alcohol swabs or water and soap (which provides both diagnosis and treatment). Recognizing the diagnosis avoids unnecessary skin biopsies.
Examples of case reports from the literature include a man who avoided washing the skin area surrounding an artificial pacemaker out of fear it might be damaged; a woman who didn't clean the right side of her chest due to hyperesthesia following an amputation for breast cancer (mastectomy); a girl who was afraid to wash the area around an abdominal scar; and a man with multiple fractures, shoulder dislocation and radial nerve palsy which significantly reduced his mobility.
Differential diagnosis.
Many other conditions can lead to localized scaling or hyperpigmentation.
This condition should firmly be distinguished from dermatitis artefacta, which is the "factitious" creation of a skin lesion, whereas dermatosis neglecta results from unconscious avoidance of cleaning due to pain or immobility.
Other skin conditions which should not be mistaken for dermatosis neglecta include: terra firma-forme dermatosis (in which there is no history of inadequate cleaning); confluent and reticulated papillomatosis of Gougerot and Carteaud; several forms of ichthyosis; acanthosis nigricans; and Vagabond's disease.
History.
The term was first coined by Poskitt and coworkers in 1995.

RAM limit

In electronic digital computers, there are different limitations on the usable memory address space. Even if a microprocessor supports, for example, 32-bit addressing, the integrated circuit package may only allow external access to a lower number of address bits, restricting the memory that can be installed. In modern personal computers, some limits are due to the design of processor, others due to the design of chipsets, BIOS and other hardware and related electrical limitations. Operating system and application software on a hardware platform may not have the capacity to use the full address space physically available.
CPU addressing limits.
For performance reasons, all the parallel address lines of an address bus must be valid at the same time, otherwise access to memory would be delayed and performance would be seriously reduced. Integrated circuit packages may have a limit on the number of pins available to provide the memory bus. Different versions of a CPU architecture, in different-sized IC packages, can be designed, trading off reduced package size for reduced pin count and address space. A trade-off might be made between address pins and other functions, restricting the memory physically available to an architecture even if it inherently has a higher capacity. On the other hand, segmented or bank switching designs provide more memory address space than is available in an internal memory address register. 
As integrated circuit memory became less costly, it was feasible to design systems with larger and larger physical memory spaces.
Fewer than 16 address pins.
Microcontroller devices with integrated I/O and memory on-chip sometimes had no, or a small, address bus available for external devices. For example, a microcontroller family available with a 2 kilobyte address space might have a variant that brought out an 11 line address bus for an external ROM; this could be done by reassigning I/O pins as address bus pins. Some general-purpose processors with integrated ROM split a 16-bit address space between internal ROM and an external 15-bit memory bus.
16 address bits, 16 address pins.
Most 8-bit general-purpose microprocessors have 16-bit address spaces and generate 16 address lines. Examples include the Intel 8080, Intel 8085, Zilog Z80, Motorola 6800, Microchip PIC18, and many others. These processors have 8-bit CPUs with 8-bit data and 16-bit addressing. The memory on these CPUs is addressable at the byte level. This leads to a memory addressable limit of 216 × 1 byte = 65,536 bytes or 64 kilobytes.
16 address bits, 20 address pins: 8086, 8088, 80186 & 80188.
The Intel 8086 and derivatives, such as the 8088, 80186 and 80188 form the basis of the popular x86 platform and are the first level of the IA16 architecture. These were 16-bit CPUs with 20-bit addressing. The memory on these CPUs were addressable at the byte level. This led to a memory addressable limit of 220 × 1 byte = 1,048,576 bytes or 1 megabyte.
16 bit addresses, 24 address pins: 80286.
The Intel 80286 CPU used a 24-bit addressing scheme. Each memory location was byte-addressable. This results in a total addressable space of 224 × 1 byte = 16,777,216 bytes or 16 megabytes. The 286 and later could also function in real mode, which imposed the addressing limits of the 8086 processor. The 286 had support for virtual memory.
32 bit addresses, 24 address pins.
The Intel 80386SX was an economical version of the 386DX. It had a 24-bit addressing scheme, in contrast to 32-bit in the 386DX. Like the 286, the 386SX can address only up to 16 megabytes of memory.
The Motorola 68000 had a 24-bit address space, allowing it to access up to 16 megabytes of memory.
32 bit addresses, 32 address pins.
The 386DX had 32-bit addressing, allowing it to address up to 4 gigabytes (4096 megabytes) of memory.
The Motorola 68020, released in 1984, had a 32-bit address space, giving it a maximum addressable memory limit of 4GB. All following chips in the Motorola 68000 series inherited this limit.
32 bit addresses 36 address pins: Pentium Pro (aka P6).
The Pentium Pro and all Pentium 4's have 36-bit addressing, which resulted in total addressable space of 64 gigabytes.
Operating system RAM limits.
CP/M and 8080 addressing limit.
At the dawn of popular microcomputing, an operating system known as CP/M was the industry behemoth. This was an 8-bit operating system, and had a 16-bit addressing limit, limiting everything to a 64 kB space, meaning all programs were limited to a 64 kB total size, and RAM was limited to 64 kB. This limit was preserved into a descendant operating system called MS-DOS as the limit to the addressing space and file size of .COM files.
IBM PC and 8086 addressing limit.
In the original IBM PC, the basic RAM limit is 640 kB. This is to allow for hardware addressing space in the upper 384 kB (upper memory area (UMA)) of the total addressable memory space of 1024 kB (1 MB). Ways to overcome the "640k barrier", as it came to be known, involved using special addressing modes available in the 286 and later x86 processors. The 1 MB total address space was a result of the 20-bit address space limit imposed on the 8086 (and 8088) CPU.
Using the color video buffer space, some third-party utilities could add memory at the top of the 640k conventional memory area, to extend memory up to the base address used by hardware adapters. This could ultimately backfill RAM up to the MDA base address.
Hardware extensions allowed access to more memory than the 8086 CPU could address through paging memory. This memory was known as expanded memory. An industry "de facto" standard was developed by the LIM consortium, composed of Lotus, Intel and Microsoft. This standard was the Expanded Memory Specification (EMS). Pages of memory from expanded memory hardware were accessible through an addressing window placed into a free area in the UMA space, and by exchanging it for other pages when needed to access other memory. EMS supported 16 MB of space.
Using a quirk in the 286 CPU architecture, the "high memory area" (HMA) was accessible, as the first 64 kB above the 1 MB limit of 20-bit addressing in the x86 architecture.
Using the 24-bit memory addressing capabilities of the 286 CPU architecture, a total address space of 16 MB was accessible. Memory above the 1 MB limit was called extended memory. However the area between 640 kB and 1 MB was reserved for hardware addressing in IBM PC compatibles. DOS and other real mode programs, limited to 20-bit addresses, could only access this space through EMS emulation on the extended memory, or an EMS analog for extended memory. Microsoft developed a standard known as the Extended Memory Specification (XMS). Accessing the memory above the HMA required usage of the "protected mode" of the 286 CPU.
With the development of the i386 CPU architecture, the address space was moved to 32-bit addressing, and a limit of 4 GB. With this CPU, access to 16 MB memory areas was available to DOS programs that used DOS extenders, such as DOS/4GW, MiniGW/16, MiniGW, and others. Initially a "de facto" industry memory standard for interaction known as VCPI was developed. Later, a Microsoft standard supplanted this, known as the DPMI. These standards allowed direct access to the 16 MB space, instead of the paging scheme used by EMS and XMS.
16-bit OS/2 RAM limit.
16-bit OS/2 was limited to 15 MB, due to reserve space designed into the operating system. It reserved the top 1 MB of the 16 MB 24-bit address space for non-memory (from 15 MB to 16 MB).
32-bit x86 RAM limit.
In non-PAE modes of x86 processors, the RAM is always limited to 4 GB.
Limits on memory and address space vary by platform and operating system, and on Windows by whether the IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE value of the LOADED_IMAGE structure and 4-gigabyte tuning (4GT) are in use.
Limits on physical memory for 32-bit platforms also depend on the Physical Address Extension (PAE), which allows 32-bit systems to use more than 4 GB of physical memory.
PAE and 64-bit systems can address up to the full address space of the x86 processor.

Matsudaira Tadakazu

Viscount was the 8th and final "daimyō" of Shimabara Domain in Hizen Province, Kyūshū, Japan (modern-day Nagasaki Prefecture).
Biography.
Tadakazu was the 16th son of the Mito Domain Tokugawa Nariaki, and was thus the younger brother of Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu. In 1861, when the 7th "daimyō" of Shimabara, Matsudaira Tadachika died without heir, Tadakazu was selected as his replacement, and was posthumously adopted as his son. He assumed the office of "daimyō" on December 16, 1861 and was awarded lower 6th court rank the same day.
With increasing anti-Shogunal activities on part of Satsuma Domain to the south and Chōshū Domain to the east, and with neighboring Saga Domain showing signs of leaning towards the anti-Tokugawa Alliance, the situation in Shimabara domain was increasingly uncertain. To compound the situation, Tadakazu was ordered by Edo to lead his forces against Chōshū in both the First Chōshū Punitive Expedition of 1864, and Second Chōshū Punitive Expedition in 1866. Both expeditions were extremely unpopular among his "samurai", many of whom had fallen under the influence of the Sonnō jōi movement.
In 1868, with the start of the Boshin War, he pledged Shimabara domain in support of Emperor Meiji, and proved his loyalty by committing his troops to the northern campaign against the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei, fighting at Akita and Morioka. 
In June 1869, the title of "daimyō" was abolished, and he was appointed domain governor. However, in 1871, Shimabara domain itself was abolished with the abolition of the han system, and became part of the new Nagasaki Prefecture. Tadakazu relocated to Tokyo. He later served as chief priest of Nikkō Tōshō-gū in the Meiji period; he was also created viscount ("shishaku") under the "kazoku" peerage system.
Matsudaira Tadakazu died in June 1917, and his grave is at the temple of Honko-ji in Kōta, Aichi.

History.
Founded by the Italian businessman Cino Del Duca in 1956, with the journalist Gaetano Baldacci, to challenge "Corriere della Sera", also a daily newspaper published in Milan. Later, because of a financial crisis, Italian public administrator Enrico Mattei with the state-owned oil company Eni bought part of the publishing company.
In 1959, Del Duca sold his stake to Eni and Italo Pietra became the newspaper's new editor.

MV Royal Iris

The MV Royal Iris is a twin screw, diesel-electric, former Mersey Ferry. The vessel was built by William Denny & Brothers of Dumbarton (Yard No. 1448) and launched in December 1950, costing £256,000.
Her engines were produced by Ruston & Hornsby Metropolitan-Vickers. Propulsion: 4 oil 4SA, each six cylinders driving four generators, each 300 kW/300v DC-connected to two electric motors, each 730shp and 2 shafts. Her maximum speed is 12 knots. Her weight is 1,234 gross tonnes. She is 159 feet long and 48 feet wide, with a draught of 9 feet. 
At least during the first decade of her life, the ship's diesel-electric propulsion made her more economical to run than the other vessels in the fleet.
Career in service.
The "Royal Iris" ran her trials on the Skelmorlie Mile on the River Clyde on 24 April 1951. Arriving in the River Mersey on 28 April 1951, she was initially owned and operated by Wallasey Corporation and carried the Borough coat of arms on the front of her superstructure. Upon entering service on 5 May 1951, she was licensed to carry 2,296 passengers on normal ferry duties, or 1,000 for cruising. 
Originally painted in a green and cream livery, the ship was distinctive in having a forward dummy funnel near her bridge and two exhaust stacks amidships, on both sides. Onboard amenities included a dancefloor and stage, tea room, buffet, cocktail bar, even a fish and chip saloon. The latter likely affording the "Royal Iris" the nickname "the fish and chip boat".
On Friday 7 September 1951 the battleship HMS "Duke of York" was under tow on her way to being broken up at Gareloch when she collided with the "Royal Iris" off Gladstone Dock. The "Royal Iris" was temporarily out of control and the floodtide carried her against the warship. The ferry was approaching the end of a cruise organised by the Amalgamated Engineering Union. Some people were hospitalised as a result of the accident.
During the 1960s numerous acts associated with the Merseybeat scene performed on the ferry, such as The Beatles and Gerry & The Pacemakers.
Later years.
The "Royal Iris" transferred to the combined fleet of the newly formed Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive on 1 December 1969, which consisted of seven vessels. 
Despite an ongoing financial debt against the "Royal Iris" from when she was built, capital was made available to refit her at the Harland and Wolff in Bootle in 1971-72. Sporting a new blue and white livery, she was subsequently used, almost exclusively, as a cruise vessel. A sum of £68,000 was also provided for a new steak bar and dining area, replacing the original fish and ship saloon. Up until this refit, she had carried two side slung lifeboats on davits which were removed leaving just a single lifeboat slung from the stern.
Whilst docked for her annual survey on 12 January 1975, a fire broke out in her engine room, causing extensive electrical damage.
On 21 June 1977, the "Royal Iris" carried Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh on their Silver Jubilee Mersey Review.
The ship was used by Granada Television during the summer of 1979 as the setting for the ITV Saturday morning children's television series "The Mersey Pirate". For this purpose, a dome structure was built on the promenade deck of the vessel.
During 1984 the "Royal Iris" and the other three Mersey Ferries received the red, white and blue livery to mark the 1984 International Garden Festival at Otterspool. In April and May 1985 the vessel left Liverpool Bay for the first time since her delivery from Scotland. She was sent on a 1500 mile round trip to London on a publicity drive for Merseyside, sailing around Land's End, up the River Thames and under Tower Bridge, docking adjacent to .
Decline, withdrawal and a new beginning in Liverpool.
During the early 1990s, funding was found to allow "Mountwood", "Woodchurch" and "Overchurch" an extensive refurbishment, which included provision for cruising duties. The ageing "Royal Iris", the last ex-Wallasey vessel, was considered surplus to requirements due to the fact she had a major survey due and the great cost of bringing her up to modern standards. Over the passing years she had become noticeably slower and a lot more expensive to maintain.
The "Royal Iris" ran a farewell evening cruise on the 12 January 1991, prior to being taken out of service and laid up awaiting confirmation of her fate. On 21 April 1991, she was granted a one day licence from the Department of Transport to carry 600 people on a cruise to mark the 73rd Anniversary of The Zeebrugge Raid of 1918. On the 16 August 1991, she was placed in the hands of shipbrokers SC Chambers Limited of Liverpool for an asking price of £100,000.
In November 1991, she was sold to a consortium for conversion into a floating nightclub, restaurant and conference centre, based in Liverpool under the name of 'Mr Smith's Nightclub'. She was delivered to the Stanley Dock complex in early 1992 to begin her new life on Merseyside and was subsequently painted Bright Blue with a red band around the top deck windows.
Leaving of Liverpool.
On Saturday, 7 August 1993, the "Liverpool Echo" carried front page news that the "Royal Iris" had been sold to Hertfordshire-based Parkway Leisure who had the intention of turning her into a floating nightspot in Cardiff, spending £300,000 on refurbishments. On Wednesday 10 August 1993, the Royal Iris was removed from Stanley Dock. In a two hour operation she broke free from her tow line and smashed into the dock wall twice. The "Royal Iris" finally left the River Mersey for the last time, under tow, on the morning of Thursday 12 August 1993, after being towed to the Pier Head for a final goodbye.
On Wednesday 10 August 1994, it was reported that a planning proposal regarding the use of the vessel had been rejected by Cardiff Council. No work had been carried out on the vessel in the preceding 12 months and berthing charges had not been paid. A spokesman for her new owners, Parkway Leisure, reported that they were 'open to offers'.
In January 1996, it was reported that a business consortium from Liverpool were in talks to bring the "Royal Iris" back to the Mersey and make her seaworthy again. The consortium were considering applying for National Lottery funding and launching a £1-a-head public subscription fundraising campaign. This venture ultimately did not come to fruition.
The move to London.
In 2002 the vessel was towed to a berth on the River Thames near Woolwich, awaiting a possible refit as a floating nightclub.
On Saturday, 6 February 2010, it was reported that Police and the RNLI had been called out to her berth on the River Thames, near Woolwich, after a passing vessel noticed she had taken on water up to her passenger deck. At the present time, it is unclear how long she has been in this state. There was evidence found to suggest that squatters had been living on board. Also found on board were various items of drug paraphernalia.
The campaign to return her to Merseyside.
On Saturday, 20 February 2010, the "Liverpool Echo" carried an article about an unnamed Wirral businessman who wishes to buy her.
On Thursday, 4 March 2010, the "Liverpool Echo" carried an article about an online petition to have her returned to Merseyside
On Tuesday, 9 March 2010, James Jegede, the current owner of the "Royal Iris", spoke to BBC Radio Merseyside about his plans for her.

Karl Henry von Wiegand

Karl Henry von Wiegand (born 1874 in Hesse in Germany; died 1961) was a German born American journalist and war correspondent.
__NOTOC__
Career from 1911.
Von Wiegand worked from 1911 until 1917 for the United Press and from 1917 for Hearst Newspapers.
Wiegand was the first United States reporter allowed to interview the German crown prince Wilhelm. That interview was also the first foreign interview given by a German noble since the outbreak of World War I.
William said this in English:
Karl von Wiegand was the father of journalist (also for Hearst's Newspapers) and abstract painter Charmion von Wiegand.
Interwar career.
He was one of the Hearst Press reporters on at least two of the Graf Zeppelin flights, usually accompanying fellow Hearst reporter Lady Hay Drummond-Hay.
Wiegand was the first American journalist to interview Hitler, having first met him in 1921 while he was only a minor malcontent in post-World War I Munich. He was one of the first journalists to take Hitler seriously, however, and his story was published on November 12, 1922, a year before the Beer Hall Putsch. As such, Wiegand provided the first introduction Americans had to Hitler. He referred to him as the "German Mussolini", and expressed genuine concern about his popularity, writing "The shadow of the Fascisti is arising in Germany. Whether what is yet only a shadow will clothe itself in the flesh, blood and spirit of the German Mussolini, depends on a number of things." He also emphasized his "man of the people" qualities, his charisma, and his electrifying speaking ability. He pegged him as a potentially great leader, saying "Hitler has the earmarks of a leader. Whether it be merely a band or a great movement, only the future will tell."
World War II and after.
A month after Germany invaded France in World War II, Karl secured an interview with Hitler and published his report "Europe for the Europeans: Adolf Hitler on the international situation during the war in France; An interview granted to Karl v. Wiegand, Führer's Headquarters, June 11, 1940".
Later, Lady Drummond-Hay and Karl von Wiegand were interned in a Japanese camp in Manila, Philippines. When they were set free in 1945, she was very ill. They returned to the United States, but during their stay in New York Lady Grace Drummond-Hay died of coronary thrombosis in the Lexington Hotel. After her cremation Karl brought her ashes back to the United Kingdom.
He died of pneumonia in Zurich at the age of 86.

History.
The estate is first recorded in 1170 when it was confirmed, as part of the parish of Kirkurd, to Bishop Engelram of Glasgow by Pope Alexander III. The present Castle Craig was built in 1798 by Sir John Gibson-Carmichael (1773–1803), a relative of the Earl of Hyndford. In 1905 it was sold to James Mann, who commissioned Sir John James Burnet to remodel the house. It was in use as a residential school in the early 1970s.
The founders of the hospital, Peter McCann and Dr. Margaret Ann McCann, first founded a treatment centre at Clouds House in Wiltshire, England, in 1983, before opening Castle Craig in 1988. Castle Craig is a category B listed building.

Bulgakov Museum in Moscow

The Bulgakov Museum in Moscow commemorates the life and work of author Mikhail Afanasyevich Bulgakov in an apartment where he lived in Moscow, Russia, and in which he set portions of his novel "The Master and Margarita". Graffiti, including text from the novel and drawings of its characters, have decorated the external walls and stairwells of the apartment building since the beginning of perestroika. It is located about two blocks from Patriarch Ponds, the scene of the opening chapter of the novel, where the Moscow city government had planned to erect statues commemorating the novel. It is close to Mayakovskaya metro station
The once luxurious rental house, constructed by millionaire Ilya Pigit, owner of the tobacco factory Ducat, was fitted for the first working commune after the revolution. The house, which housed or was visited by dancer Isadora Duncan and poet Sergey Esenin, Alice Koonen and Andrei Bely, Vasily Surikov and bass Fyodor Shaliapin, imaginists and futurists, the members of the artistic group the Jack of Diamonds, and the whole Moscow bohemians, was filled up with the proletariat in the early post-revolutionary years. The studios of the artists Pyotr Konchalovsky and Georgy Yakulov, which were situated in the court of the house 10, were kept, and artistic life continued to pulsate there weekly. What occurred in other apartments – Bulgakov described vividly in the stories "№ 13 – Elpit Rabcommune Building", "The Psalm", "The Moonshine Lake", and finally in the novel "The Master and Margarita".
The communal flat № 50, where Mikhail Bulgakov and his wife lived during 1921–24, became the prototype of that "Odd Flat", where Voland with his court settled up, and where that leading to another measurement mysterious stairs is situated. Years passed, and the stairs of the entrance № 6 became a bewitched place: since the 1970s people come here to sit on those steps, where Annushka found the horse-shoe, to recollect the favourite fragments from the Novel, to sing and to dream. The stairs became one of the unofficial cultural centers of Moscow of 1980–90s. In the attic the “Academy of the Hippie” was organized, and the walls of the entrance were covered with drawings, quotations from Bulgakov’s works, declarations of love to Bulgakov and his characters. During these years, the door of the "flat № 50" was closed for the fans of Bulgakov: it housed a design office. But in the 1990s the Bulgakov Fund was based there, and then since April 2007 – the only official Bulgakov Museum in Russia.
Now "The Odd Flat" is revived and not only shadows of literary personages and former tenants roam here. It is opened for everyone, who wants to find himself inside the novel, to learn more about Bulgakov and his epoch, to communicate with like-minded persons.
Gradually a constant exposition was created on the basis of the collections of Bulgakov’s nieces E.A. Zemskaya and V.M. Svetlaeva, and also V.F. Dimenko’s collection.
Cultural events in “The Odd Flat”: plays of the theatre "KomediantЪ", the first half of 20th century jazz concerts and concerts of classical music, exhibitions and subject seminars: culturological seminars are connected with the club "New Moscow", literary-philosophical – with the work of the "Bulgakov discussion club", and traditional meetings of Aleksey Didurov’s Rock-cabaret.
On December 22, 2006, the museum in Bulgakov's flat was damaged by an anti-satanist protester and disgruntled neighbor, Alexander Morozov.

Maritime Security Identification Card

What is an MSIC?
A Maritime Security Identification Card (MSIC) is a nationally consistent identification card which is issued to identify a person who has been the subject of a background check. It shows that the holder has met the minimum security requirements and needs to work unescorted or unmonitored in a maritime security zone. The MSIC is not an access card and the relevant authority at each port or facility still controls access to its maritime security zones.
Since 1 December 2010, the expiry dates of MSIC changed from five years to either two or four years. Each applicant of an MSIC must decide whether to select a two or four year MSIC upon application. If a four year MSIC is selected, a total of two background checks will be conducted; the first upon the initial application and the second background check two years later. 
Background.
In May 2005, the Australian Government introduced amendments to the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 in Federal Parliament in an effort to further secure the nation's maritime and offshore industries. These amendments have led to the introduction of maritime security identity cards (MSIC) which will ensure that those working in these critical industries are subject to appropriate background checking as now occurs in the aviation industry.
As a nationally recognised form of maritime and offshore industry identification, the MSIC distinguishes the holder as having met the minimum background checking requirements. It is essential for all maritime industry workers and contractors who operate within maritime security zones (MSZ) at ports, ships and oil and gas facilities. 
Since 1 January 2007, all personnel requiring unmonitored access to a maritime or offshore security zone are required to display an MSIC. A maritime or offshore security zone is designated by maritime and offshore facility operators. MSZs may be established for a range of reasons including:
The MSIC is a program similar to the Aviation Security Identification Card, program found in the aviation industry.
On 29 January 2010, the then Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Minister Albanese, announced a number of enhancements to the MSIC regime following a review of the MSIC scheme. The key changes coming out of the announcement include:
Who needs an MSIC?
A person has an operational need to hold an MSIC if his or her occupation or business interests require, or will require, him or her to have unmonitored access to a maritime security zone at least once a year.
This includes:
What does the application process involve?
Once an applicant has lodged their application, the issuing body will confirm the applicant's identity, confirm the applicant's operational need for an MSIC, request a background check of the applicant by AusCheck, and if necessary, confirm the applicant's right to work in Australia.
The Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement allows Australian and New Zealand citizens to live and work in each country respectively. As such, New Zealand citizens possess an Entitlement to Work in Australia upon entry into Australia.
What is involved in a background check for an MSIC?
AusCheck, a unit of the Attorney General's Department, is now responsible for coordinating the background checks of MSIC applicants and people who are involved in the issue of MSICs. The Background checking process includes an assessment of:
How do I apply for an MSIC?
The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Infrastructure Australia) authorises organisations to serve as an approved MSIC Issuing Body. There are currently 23 authorised MSIC Issuing Bodies. Of these 23 issuing bodies:
Do MSIC cards provide port access?
An MSIC is a nationally consistent identification card. An MSIC is not an access card. Some ports have combined their facility access control cards with the MSIC card. As a result, confusion has arisen within the industry as to whether the MSIC card belongs to the port or to the individual once the MSIC holder no longer requires access to the linked port facility. 
Like a drivers license, the MSIC belongs to the individual and serves as a nationally recognized form of identification for whichever port or offshore facility the individual may visit. 
What are MSIC Conditions of Use?
The following are conditions of use that an MSIC holders agrees to accept.
From 1 January 2007 you must wear your MSIC in a maritime security zone unless you have an exemption. An MSIC must be: 
You must keep your MSIC in a safe and secure location whilst not in use. 
You must not alter or deface your MSIC. 
Your MSIC is not transferable and can only be used by you. 
You must return your MSIC within 30 days to the issuing body after it: 
If you change your name you must notify the body that issued the MSIC within 30 days. You will be issued with a replacement MSIC. 
If your MSIC is lost or stolen, you will need to provide a statutory declaration or police report or other information issued by the police before a replacement card can be issued by an issuing body. 
You will have committed an offence if your MSIC is lost, stolen or destroyed and you do not advise your issuing body within 7 days. 
You will have committed an offence if you contravene the regulations on how and where and MSIC must be worn. 
Further information on offences for contravening the MSIC regulations and their penalties can be found in the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Regulations 2005.
Other Security Identification Programs (International).
United States - Transportation Worker Identification Credential (or TWIC). On 25 November 2002, Congress directed the federal government, through the Maritime Transportation Security Act (or MTSA), to issue a biometric security credential to individuals who require unescorted access to secure areas of facilities and vessels and all mariners holding Coast Guard issued credentials or qualification documents. Controlling access to secure areas is critical to enhancing port security.
TWIC is a common identification credential for all personnel requiring unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA regulated facilities and vessels, and all mariners holding Coast Guard-issued credentials. Individuals who meet TWIC eligibility requirements will be issued a tamper-resistant credential containing the worker's biometric (fingerprint template) to allow for a positive link between the card and the individual.

Billy Briscoe

William "Billy" Briscoe (6 November 1896 – 7 February 1994) was an English footballer who played as a forward.
A former Watford, Stoke, Milton Brotherhood, and Leek United player; he first turned professional with Port Vale in 1918. After five years he moved on to Congleton Town for a season, only to return to Vale in 1924. He then spent the next seven years with the club, racking up a combined total of 307 league appearances for the club over his two spells, scoring 51 goals. He returned to Congleton in 1931 before later retiring from the game.
He also played cricket for Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Championship from 1921 to 1925.
Playing career.
Briscoe appeared for Watford, Stoke (three appearances), Milton Brotherhood and Leek United before signing professional forms with Port Vale in January 1918. The club were re-elected into the Football League in October 1919, and Briscoe scored his first Second Division goal on 15 November, in a 2–1 defeat at Clapton Orient. In total he scored 10 goals in 25 appearances in 1919–20. He scored past rivals Stoke on 25 September 1920, in a 2–1 win at The Old Recreation Ground. He also got on the scoresheet at Molineux and the City Ground to take his league tally to three goals in 35 games in 1920–21. He featured 34 times in 1921–22, scoring just the one goal. He was a member of the sides that shared the North Staffordshire Infirmary Cup in 1920 and 1922. He hit three goals in 40 appearances in 1922–23.
Briscoe failed to agree terms with the Port Vale board in the summer of 1923, and switched to nearby non-league side Congleton Town. In January 1924, Vale offered better terms and he re-signed. Despite only playing 21 games, he finished the 1923–24 season as joint-top scorer, tied with Tom Page on 10 goals. He scored 12 goals in 44 games in 1924–25, missing just the one match all season, though the prolific Wilf Kirkham now took on the mantel as the club's main source of goals. He hit four of his 12 goals in an 8–2 mauling of non-league Alfreton in an FA Cup qualifier on 13 December. Briscoe scored four goals in 26 games in 1925–26, and even played a match whilst suffering from appendicitis.
Briscoe hit seven goals in 32 appearances in 1926–27, and helped the club to finish above Stoke City in the league for the first time. He hit five goals in 22 games in 1927–28, missing much of the season with a broken cheekbone. He scored twice in 25 games in 1928–29, but could not help the club to avoid relegation. He played eight league games in 1929–30, as Vale stormed to the Third Division North title. However he did not feature in the 1930–31 season, and was given a free transfer back to Congleton Town in May 1931, who he also coached. In 13 years at the club he had played 331 games (193 in the Football League) and scored 60 goals (43 in the Football League).

Cabinet of Norway

The Cabinet of Norway is a formal body composed of the most senior government ministers chosen by the Prime Minister, and functions as the collective decision-making organ constituting the executive branch of the Kingdom. It is referred to as the Council of State (Norwegian: "Statsrådet"), and simultaneously plays the role of privy council as well as government Cabinet. With the exception of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who retain their ministerial ranking in their own right, all the other members of the Cabinet concurrently hold the position of "statsråd", meaning Councillor of State, and that of Chief of the various departments, not formally being considered 'ministers', although commonly addressed as such. The Cabinet normally convenes every week, usually on Fridays at 11:00 a.m. at the Royal Palace, Oslo, and is presided over by the King.
Constitutional basis.
Under the 1814 Constitution of Norway, the second-oldest national Constitution still in operation (after the US Constitution), the King is the head of the executive branch of Norway. However, historical developments such as the introduction of Parliamentarism in 1884 and evolving constitutional tradition have altered the King's role, meaning that the Prime Minister, holding the leadership of a political party enjoying electoral support, is the "de facto" head of government. Accordingly, when Article 3 of the Constitution reads, "The Executive Power is vested in the King", this nowadays reflects the powers conferred on the elected government, operating through the Council of State and headed by the Prime Minister.
The parliamentary system of Norway entails that the Cabinet must not have Parliament against it, and that the appointment by the King is a formality. The members making up the Council of State require the confidence of the Norwegian legislative body, known as the Storting. In practice, the monarch will ask the leader of a parliamentary block that has a majority in the Storting to form a government. After elections resulting in no clear majority to any party or coalition, the leader of the party most likely to be able to form a government is appointed Prime Minister. 
The fact that the original wording of the Constitution has not been modified to reflect contemporary practice, is a testimony to the widespread conservative sentiments shared across the political aisle that extensive constitutional revision should be avoided. In practice, this means that the function, authority and mandate of the Council of State is heavily influenced by long-standing conventions.
The Council of State is established by the following article of the Constitution, stating that
Functions and mandate.
The Council of State convenes to formally make decisions on matters of State, passing so-called Royal Resolutions (Norwegian: "Kongelige resolusjoner") or Orders in Council. Theoretically, the Royal Resolutions themselves are the King's decisions, but are practically those of the government. However, they require the contra-signature of the Prime Minister, or, in cases relating to military command, of the Minister of Defence in order to be valid. Later, entire records from the proceedings of the Council of State is signed by all its members. This is done in order to remove all personal responsibility on part of the King, in keeping with Article 5 of the Constitution, which states that, "The King's person is sacred; he cannot be censured or accused. The responsibility rests with his Council". Another feature of this system is that the King, when having sanctioned a decision, is referred to as King-in-Council (Norwegian: "Kongen i statsråd"), meaning the King as well as his council.
According to the Constitution, certain cases, such as appointments and dismissals of higher office, pardons, provisional measures, church ordinances and ratifications of treaties must be administered by the Council of State. Whilst not prescribed in the Constitution, the signing of bills and other regulations into law is the most important feature of the work being conducted during sessions of the Council of State.
Duty of remonstrance.
Article 30 of the Norwegian Constitution states that any member of the Council of State, if he is of the opinion that the "King's decision conflicts with the form of government or the laws of the Realm" is bound by a "duty to make strong remonstrances against it, as well as to enter his opinion in the records." The Article continues by stating that a Member who has not voiced such objections is liable of impeachment by the Storting should a decision made in the Council of State later be found unlawful. For the same reason, the aforesaid Article prescribes that all of the decisions made in the Council of State shall be put down in official records.
Requirements of membership.
Whilst most members of the Cabinet originate from within the Storting and will have their seats deputised during their time in office, being Member of Parliament is not a requirement. However, since the introduction of Parliamentarism in 1884, all members of the Cabinet must have the express support of the legislature. In addition, they must hold Norwegian citizenship and be eligible to vote, meaning that they have attained the age of 18. Another requirement is that there must be a majority of members affiliated with the Church of Norway, the national state church. When church matters are on the table, all members of the Cabinet not registered with the Church will not be in attendance.
Order of precedence and succession.
There is no official order of succession to the premiership of Norway, but the Minister of Foreign Affairs has traditionally been regarded as akin to Deputy Prime Minister, although no such title officially exists. The King established on 1 July 1993 an Order of precedence to direct seating and ranking on formal occasions. Here, the Minister of Finance enjoys the foremost rank after the Prime Minister, with the Minister of Foreign Affairs only coming in third, behind the minister of Agriculture and Food.

Distraction display

Distraction displays, also known as deflection display, diversionary display or paratrepsis, are anti-predator behaviours used to attract the attention of an enemy away from an object, typically the nest or young, that is being protected. They are particularly well known in birds but noted also in fish. Distraction displays are, however, not very well defined and the definition has been the subject of much debate. They are sometimes classed more generically under "nest protection behaviours" along with aggressive displays such as mobbing.
It has been suggested that distraction displays exist mainly in birds, since they have the ability to escape at the last moment out of reach of ground predators. Displays are used mainly for ground predators, and are rarely used against avian predators.
Several variations are known in these distraction displays. Nesting male three-spined sticklebacks, when approached by groups of conspecifics, will move away from the nest and simulate feeding on the substrate. Adults will feed on the eggs of nesting conspecifics.
False brooding is an approach used by plovers. The bird moves away from the nest site and crouches on the ground so as to appear to be sitting at a nest and allows the predator to approach close before escaping.
Injury feigning is one of the more common forms of distraction. The "broken-wing" display is particularly well-known in nesting waders and plovers and doves such as the Mourning Dove. Birds that are at the nest walk away from the nest with one wing hung low and dragging on the ground so as to appear as an easy target for a predator. Several interpretations have been made for the evolution of the behaviour and the cognitive abilities involved. 
Another display is the "rodent run", which is seen in plovers as well as some passerine birds. Here the nesting bird drops to the ground or moves away, creeping along with the head held low and making turns as if dodging imaginary obstacles.
Costs.
If a signal is not honest, predators can quickly learn to ignore distraction displays. Distraction displays have their cost and displaying adult birds are sometimes captured by the predator being distracted or by other opportunist predators.

Hamsun (film)

Hamsun is a 1996 Danish-Swedish-Norwegian-German drama directed by Jan Troell, about the later life of the Norwegian author Knut Hamsun (Max von Sydow), who together with his wife Marie Hamsun (Ghita Nørby), went from being national saints to national traitors after supporting Nazi Germany during their occupation of Norway during World War II.
The film is notable for its use of language. Sydow and Nørby speak in their native Swedish and Danish respectively, though there is a scene where he speaks English and several where she speaks German; the rest of the cast speak Norwegian or German.
It won the Gulbagge Awards for Best Film, Best Actor (Sydow), Best Actress (Nørby) and Best Script (Enquist).
Production.
The plans for the film have a history from 1979, when Thorkild Hansen, the author of the book "Processen mod Hamsun" contacted Troell, wanting him to direct a Norwegian television series based on the book. Max von Sydow was meant to do the part as Hamsun already then. But NRK dropped out on the project, believing it would be too controversial.
Fourteen years later, in 1993, von Sydow brought the project back to life when he got the Danish production company Nordisk Film interested in adapting the book, this time with Per Olov Enquist, who had written Troell's previous film "", providing the screenplay.
The shooting took place during the spring and summer 1995, with a budget of around 40 million SEK. Noteworthy is that the most expensive scene filmed, where Marie Hamsun witnesses the attack and sinking of the German cruiser "Blücher" in the Oslofjord at the battle of Drøbak Sound on 9 April 1940, was cut from the finished product.
Release.
The film was initially meant to be released in the autumn 1996 at the Venice Film Festival, but was brought forward to the spring as Norwegian television would release another film about Hamsun the same year. It also saved the film from having to compete against Bille August's historical epic "Jerusalem".
During the Swedish release Troell and the producer heavily criticized the distributor, Svensk Filmindustri, for the sloppy handling of the film, something he had also experienced with his previous film "Il Capitano".

Oakville, Texas

Oakville is an unincorporated community in northeastern Live Oak County, Texas, United States. It lies along Interstate 37 northeast of the city of George West, the county seat of Live Oak County. Its elevation is 171 feet (52 m). Although Oakville is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 78060.
Oakville originated as a stagecoach station shortly after the Texas Revolution. A community was established in 1856, after a local landowner donated land; it soon became the county seat of Live Oak County, and its post office—the county's first—was established there in the following year. Originally referred to by the name of the local Sulphur Creek, it received its current name from an advertisement in a newspaper. After the Civil War, Oakville became a local commercial center; the county's first bank and public school were established there, and the "Live Oak County Leader", a newspaper, was founded in the community in 1891. It began to decline after a railroad line was built through a different part of the county in 1913, and it lost the status of county seat after a new courthouse was built in George West in 1919.

Plot.
Most normal humans use only 30% of their brains, but a group of people known as the "Dokeshi" can use 50 to 60% of their brains, and thus have special abilities. These powers, however, come with a price: the Dokeshi must observe certain restrictions. Ignoring these rules can lead to the loss of something precious from within. In young Shotaro's case, he has to stick to doing one good deed every day! In the central town of Toykyo, he meets a girl named Mana, and together they go on a journey to find Shotaro's childhood friend Emine. Will Shotaro be able to do good daily or will he succumb to laziness on his journey?
Key Terms.
Dokeshi: Humans with the ability to use 50 to 60 percent of their brain, which grants them near-magical powers. All Dokeshi must observe a "condition" which must be fulfilled or else the Dokeshi will lose something valuable to them.
The Masked Assembly: A federation of Dokeshi factions that was created to overthrow the government of Japon and the Dokeshi Hunt.
The Dokeshi Hunt: A secret Dokeshi suppression force created by the government of Japan to wipe out Dokeshi.

Irish Manuscripts Commission

The Irish Manuscripts Commission was established in 1928 by the newly founded Irish Free State with the intention of furthering the study of Ireland's manuscript collections and archives. Its foundation was primarily motivated by the loss of many historical documents when the Irish Public Record Office was destroyed during the Battle of Dublin in the Irish Civil War, and by the burning of Irish family records by the IRA at the Custom House in 1920. 
The Commission catalogues and publishes editions of such documents. It also publishes the journal "Analecta Hibernica", which provides information on the Commission's work and editions of shorter manuscripts. Since 1930 it has overseen the publication of over 140 titles.
The Commission is run by a chairman and a board appointed by the Irish government. The Commission's works were published by the Irish Stationery Office (now the Government Supplies Agency) until 1990. Since 1991 it has published its own works. 
The Irish Manuscripts Commission is based at 45 Merrion Square, Dublin 2. It shares a building with the Irish Architectural Archive.
The Commission's first chairman on its foundation was Eoin MacNeill. Among its first board members was Richard Irvine Best. The current chair is James McGuire of University College Dublin.
In 2008 the Irish Government announced its intention to amalgamate the Commission, the National Archives of Ireland and National Library of Ireland as part of a wide-ranging programme of cut-backs. The announcement proved highly controversial, with Fintan O'Toole and Donnchadh Ó Corráin among the most vocal opponents of the measure.

Bear Lake (Fort Connelly)

Bear Lake, formerly known as Fort Connelly or Fort Connolly, or Connolly's Lake, is an unincorporated settlement located on the northeast side of the lake of the same name, which lies to the north of Babine Lake and Takla Lake in the northwestern end of the Omineca Country in the North-Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada. At the same location is Takla Lake First Nation's Bear Lake Indian Reserve No. 4.
History.
Fort Connelly, also spelled Fort Connolly was founded in 1826 by James Douglas as a fur trade post in the New Caledonia fur district of the Hudson's Bay Company, and was named by him in honour of his father-in-law, William Connelly. Along with the posts of Fort Babine and Fort Chilcotin, Fort Connelly was established in accordance with the HBC's decision to extend New Caledonia's trade northward and westward in an attempt to intercept or stem the flow of furs from the interior to the coast, where American maritime fur traders bought them at high prices.
The Connelly Range in the same area was named for the fort, which may not have been at the location of the present-day settlement, but may have been either at the north end of the lake, or on an island in Tsaytut Bay. Nothing remains of the original fort, except its name which was applied to this settlement on April 23, 1940 as "Bear Lake (Fort Connelly)", a designation which lasted until November 2, 1964 when it was simplified to "Bear Lake (Settlement)"; it has since been further re-designated as "Bear Lake (Community)".

The other ""Challenge"" is the bi-weekly newspaper of the Progressive Labor Party, a transnational communist party based primarily in the United States (but also having several smaller branches in various places in Latin and South America, and laying claim to several very small cells in other select places around the world). Due to its rather large Spanish language readership, the PLP also produces parallel issues in Spanish ("Desafio").

Information visualization reference model

The Information visualization reference model is an example of a reference model for information visualization, developed by Ed Chi in 1999., under the name of the "data state model". Chi showed that the framework successfully modeled a wide array of visualization applications and later showed that the model was functionally equivalent to the data flow model used in existing graphics toolkits such as VTK.
Overview.
In previous work, according to Chi (2000), "researchers have attempted to construct taxonomies of information visualization techniques by examining the data domains that are compatible with these techniques. This is useful because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be applied to their domain of interest. However, these taxonomies do not help the implementers understand how to apply and implement these techniques".
According to Chi (2000), he and J.T. Reidl "in 1998 extends and proposes a new way to taxonomize information visualization techniques by using the "Data State Model". Many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused. The Data State Model not only helps researchers understand the space of design, but also helps implementers understand how information visualization techniques can be applied more broadly".
In 1999 Stuart Card, Jock D. Mackinlay, and Ben Shneiderman present their own interpretation of this pattern, dubbing it the information visualization reference model.

Levi Collison

Levi Collison (1875 – 22 October 1965) was an English art publisher and printer and Liberal Member of Parliament.
Private life.
Levi Collison was born in Preston, Lancashire, and educated at private schools. He married and had two sons and two daughters. In 1925, Collison was described as a country gentleman from St Annes on Sea. At that time he resided at Barton Grange, Barton near Preston and he lived there until 1943 when the house was requisitioned by the War Office as a mess for the Women's Auxiliary Air Force.
Career.
By profession, Collison was a printer and publisher of art books and founded his own company, Collison’s Ltd, of which he was Chairman and managing director. He also had other business interests. He was a trustee of Preston Savings Bank and a chairman of a number of companies. Collison also served as a Justice of the Peace.
Politics.
Penrith and Cockermouth by-election.
In 1921, Collison was selected as Liberal candidate for the by-election in Penrith and Cockermouth caused by the resignation of the sitting Coalition Conservative MP and Speaker of the House of Commons, James Lowther. In a tight contest, Collison just failed to gain the seat for the Independent Asquithian Liberals, losing by 31 votes.
1922-1923.
Collison fought the Penrith and Cockermouth seat again at the 1922 general election. In another straight fight and facing the same Tory candidate as he had at the by-election, Major-General Cecil Lowther, Collison gained the seat by a majority of 378. However, at the general election of 1923 he was unable to hold his seat, losing to the new Conservative candidate Arthur Dixey.

The Other Side of the Underneath

The Other Side of the Underneath is a 1972 British feature film written and directed by Jane Arden and starring Sheila Allen, Liz Danciger, Penny Slinger, Ann Lynn, and Suzanka Fraey. Other members of the Holocaust Theatre Company appear in the film. It is the only British feature film in the 1970s to be solely directed by a woman. Jane Arden herself also appears in the film. The title of the film is taken from a line in Arden's play Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven which was a huge success at the London Arts Lab in 1969.
The film currently has almost mythical status amongst fans of radical, experimental cinema, partly because of its visionary and disturbing depictions of the mental state of its schizophrenic protagonist, and also because of its recent invisibility: until the July 2009 showings at the National Film Theatre (BFI South Bank) and The Cube Microplex in Bristol it had not been publicly shown anywhere since a July 1983 National Film Theatre tribute to Arden, who had committed suicide at the end of the previous year. The British Film Institute restored and remastered the film for DVD and Blu-ray release on July 13 2009. The Other Side of the Underneath was re-released simultaneously with Arden's other two feature films Separation (1967) and Anti-Clock (1979); all three films were collaborations with the producer/director Jack Bond.
The film's credits boast a rich array of talent. In addition to Arden and many actors from her renowned Holocaust Theatre Company, the film was produced and co-photographed by Jack Bond, co-photographed by Aubrey Dewar and edited by David Mingay (who later went on to direct films such as Rude Boy, 1980), and Robert Hargreaves.
The locations for the films were primarily in and around the Welsh mining communities of Abertillery and Cwmtillery in Ebbw Fach, the Eastern and smaller of the two valleys in Ebbw Vale. One early episode was filmed at the Newport Transporter Bridge. The extraordinary soundtrack to the film was primarily the work of the cellist Sally Minford who appears, usually actually playing the cello, in many interior and exterior scenes, and the sound editor Robert Hargreaves.

Platysquilla eusebia

Platysquilla eusebia is a species of mantis shrimp in the family Nannosquillidae, from the Mediterranean Sea and north-eastern Atlantic Ocean. It is a "spearer", and grows up to long.
Distribution.
"P. eusebia" is found in the Mediterranean Sea and adjacent parts of the Atlantic Ocean. It is one of only two species of mantis shrimp found in waters around the British Isles (the other being "Rissoides desmaresti"). Its occurrence in Galway Bay off the west coast of Ireland may represent the northern limit of its distribution.
Description.
"P. eusebia" grows up to long. It is a mantis shrimp of the "spearer" type, possessing raptorial claws with nine or more teeth. It may be distinguished from the other species in its genus, "P. enodis" and "P. horologii", by the number of epipods, and from "Rissoides desmaresti" by the number of spines on the last segment of the raptorial claw, with "R. desmaresti" having only five.
Taxonomy.
Although previously placed in the family Squillidae, "Platysquilla" is now considered a member of the Nannosquillidae. "P. eusebia" was originally described in the geuns "Squilla", but was moved by Raymond B. Manning to be the type species of the new genus "Platysquilla" in 1967.

CFL2 (gene)

Cofilin 2 (muscle) also known as CFL2 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the "CFL2" gene.
Function.
Cofilin is a widely distributed intracellular actin-modulating protein that binds and depolymerizes filamentous F-actin and inhibits the polymerization of monomeric G-actin in a pH-dependent manner. Cofilin-2 is a member of the AC group of proteins that also includes cofilin-1 (CFL1) and destrin (DSTN), all of which regulate actin-filament dynamics. The CFL2 gene encodes a skeletal muscle-specific isoform localized to the thin filaments, where it exerts its effect on actin, in part through interactions with tropomyosins.
Clinical significance.
Mutations in the "CFL2" gene are associated with nemaline myopathy. Deficiency of cofilin-2 may result in reduced depolymerization of actin filaments, causing their accumulation in nemaline bodies, minicores, and, possibly concentric laminated bodies.

Super Young Team

The Super Young Team is a fictional Japanese superhero team in the . The team first appears in "Final Crisis Sketchbook" #1 (May 2008), and was created by Grant Morrison and J. G. Jones.
Publication history.
The concept for the team emerged from the same pitch Grant Morrison made that contained the idea for the Great Ten, and they were first mentioned in "52" #6. They are influenced by American Superheroes and Japanese pop culture.
The characters first appeared in Morrison's "Final Crisis" where they were revealed to be the Fifth World incarnations of the Forever People. They are featured in "Final Crisis Aftermath: Dance," written by Joe Casey with art by ChrisCross. In that six-part series, their fame overwhelms them, causing judgement errors and loss of self-control.
Membership.
Most Excellent Superbat.
Most Excellent Superbat (Heino) is the team leader. He wears a wildly stylized red and yellow uniform influenced by both Superman and Batman. According to him, his power is "being so rich he can do anything", but he appears to use an array of gadgets, one of which can generate an energy-based exoskeleton, he also appears to have some training in the martial arts. His secret island base is called the "Most Serene Sanctuary" and contains a supercomputer he calls a "unified data field" which is only accessible when he meditated himself into a calm theta rhythm state. As seen in "Final Crisis Aftermath: Dance" #1, the ghost of a being calling itself "Ultimon Alpha" recently appeared to him in a vision.
By the end of the series, he revealed that he is indeed as rich as he claims when he actually buys Japan.
Big Atomic Lantern Boy.
Big Atomic Lantern Boy is Most Excellent Superbat's second in command. He wears a green outfit which is outfitted with an x-rayed circular porthole on his chest. The porthole displays his skeleton, and allows him to fire green force beams of different types of radiation. He is apparently attracted to Shiny Happy Aquazon.
Shy Crazy Lolita Canary.
Shy Crazy Lolita Canary is a winged heroine in a Japanese schoolgirl uniform, and is physically small enough to fit in someone's hand. She possesses a sonic scream (Always ""Sumimasen"" - "Excuse me") similar to that possessed by Black Canary except that it appears to be a modulated mixture of multiple voices.
Shiny Happy Aquazon.
Shiny Happy Aquazon is the daughter of Junior Waveman (Riki Kimura) - a founding member of Big Science Action - and the genius daughter of Senior Waveman Otomo. She has the ability to create hardwater constructs like Mera, the wife of Aquaman. She also is attracted to Sonic Lightning Flash. In "Final Crisis Aftermath: Dance" #4, her father who is now Senior Waveman Kimura invites her to become a member of Big Science Action.
Well-Spoken Sonic Lightning Flash.
Well-Spoken Sonic Lightning Flash is a young speedster whose real name is Keigo, with a round helmet and giant athletic shoes. He is capable of running up to 500 mph.
Sunny Sumo.
The group recruits Sunny Sumo, a powerful wrestler with self-healing abilities and the potential to resist mind control. Sumo had assisted the Forever People in their original series, but had been stranded in ancient Japan where he lived out a peaceful life.
Equipment.
The Super Young Team has a vehicle called the Wonder Wagon, which is a car capable of powered flight, similar to the Newsboy Legion´s Whiz Wagon.

1961 Natal Grand Prix

The 1st Natal Grand Prix was a motor race, run to South African Formula One-style rules, held on 17 December 1961 at Westmead Circuit, South Africa. The race was run over 89 laps of the circuit, and was won by British driver Jim Clark, in his Lotus 21.
There were no great differences between the local rules to which this race was run and the international Formula One rules, but for example sports car bodies were permitted, such as the Porsche special driven by Jennings.
Clark led the race from start to finish, with only Stirling Moss, who had started from the back of the grid, able to stay on the same lap by the end. The local South African entrants were outclassed, with the first of them finishing three laps down on Clark.

Village arboretum de Vernet-les-Bains

The Village arboretum de Vernet-les-Bains is an arboretum planted throughout the town of Vernet-les-Bains, Pyrénées-Orientales, Languedoc-Roussillon, France. It is open daily without charge.
The arboretum's beginnings can be traced to a devastating flood in 1940, with a variety of trees planted in the 1960s during restoration work. In 1992 the local primary school undertook a project to identify the tree species in town, which led to an award in 1994 from the "Fondation Yves Rocher". In 1996 the municipality officially created the "village arboretum", with a statement of faith that provides (among other things) that for every child born in town, the parents will plant that child's tree.
Today the arboretum contains more than 2,000 identified tree specimens, of which about 1,000 are labeled, representing 274 taxa. The town is divided into sections, each about 100 m² in area, with an identification sign for each keyed to the trees in that section.

Regional Rural Bank

Regional Rural Banks are the banking organizations being operated in different states of India. They have been created to serve the rural areas with banking and financial services. However, RRB's may have branches set up for urban operations and their area of operation may include urban areas too.
Functions.
The main purpose of RRB's is to mobilize financial resources from rural / semi-urban areas and grant loans and advances mostly to small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers and rural artisans. 
The area of operation of RRBs is limited to the area as notified by Government of India covering one or more districts in the State.
RRB's also perform a variety of different functions.
RRB's perform various functions in following heads • Providing banking facilities to rural and semi-urban areas. 
Carrying out government operations like disbursement of wages of MGNREGA workers, distribution of pensions etc. • Providing Para-Banking facilities like locker facilities, debit and credit cards
History.
Regional Rural Banks were established under the provisions of an Ordinance passed on 26 September 1975 and the RRB Act. 1976 to provide sufficient banking and credit facility for agriculture and other rural sectors.
These were set up on the recommendations of The Narasimham Working Group during the tenure of Indira Gandhi's government with a view to include rural areas into economic mainstream since that time about 70% of the Indian Population was of Rural Orientation.
The development process of RRBs started on 2 October 1975 with the with forming the first RRB, the Prathama Bank.
Also on 2 October 1976 five regional rural banks were set up on with a total authorised capital of Rs. 100 crore ($ 10 Million) which later augmented to 500 crore ($ 50 Million). 
There were five commercial banks, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, United Bank of India and United Commercial Bank, which sponsored the regional rural banks.
Earlier Reserve Bank of India had laid down ceilings on the rate of interest to be charged by these RRBs.
However from August 1996 the RRBs have been granted freedom to fix rates of interest, which is usually in the range of 14-18% for advances.
Recapitalization of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs).
Subsequent to review of the financial status of RRBs by the Union Finance Minister in August, 2009, it was felt that a large number of RRBs had a low Capital to Risk weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR). A committee was there­fore constituted in September, 2009 under the Chairmanship of K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, RBI to analyse the financials of the RRBs and to suggest measures including re-capitalisation to bring the CRAR of RRBs to at least 9% in a sustainable manner by 2012. The Committee submitted its report in May, 2010. The following points were recommended by the committee:
The Government of India recently approved the recapi­talization of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) to im­prove their Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio CRAR) in the following manner:
Organizational Structure.
The Organizational Structure for RRB's varies from branch to branch and depends upon the nature and size of business done by the branch.
The Head Office of an RRB normally had three to seven departments.
The following is the list of officers in decreasing order of their rank in the organization.
Amalgamation.
Currently, RRB's are going through a process of amalgamation and consolidation 25 RRBs have been amalgamated in January 2013 into 10 RRBs this counts 67 RRBs till 1st week of June 2013.
On 31 March 2006, there were 133 RRBs (post-merger) covering 525 districts with a network of 14,494 branches. On RRBs were originally conceived as low cost institutions having a rural ethos, local feel and pro poor focus. However, within a very short time, most banks were making losses. The original assumptions as to the low cost nature of these institutions were belied.This may be again amalgamated in near future.At present there are 61 RRB's in India.
Legal Existence and Protection.
RRB's are recognized by the law and they have legal significance.The Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976 Act No. 21 Of 1976 February 1976. reads 
"For the incorporation, regulation and winding up of Regional Rural Banks with a view to developing the rural economy by providing, for the purpose of development of agriculture, trade, commerce, industry and other productive activities in the rural areas, credit and other facilities, particularly to the small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, artisans and small entrepreneurs, and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto".
RRB's are therefore created with a view to develop rural economy.

The Screens

The Screens () is a play by the French dramatist Jean Genet. Its first few productions all used abridged versions, beginning with its world premiere under Hans Lietzau's direction in Berlin in May 1961. Its first complete performance was staged in Stockholm in 1964, two years before Roger Blin directed its French premiere in Paris.
Textual history.
Genet began writing the play in 1955 and continued to develop it over the following few years, completing a first version in June 1958. He re-wrote the play further while in Greece towards the end of 1959. Marc Barbezat's company L'Arbalète published it in February 1961, after which Genet re-wrote the play again. In 1976 Genet published a second, revised version, which appears in the French edition of his "Complete Works."
Production history.
The play premièred in an abridged German version in May 1961 at the Schlosspark-Theater in Berlin, which Hans Lietzau directed. A slightly revised version of the problematic German translation used in Berlin was staged by Leon Epp two years later at the Volkstheater in Vienna in 1963. Epp's interpretation emphasised the political conflict between the French and Algerians in the play. 
In London in 1964 Peter Brook staged two-thirds of the play (its first twelve scenes, in a performance that lasted for two-and-a-half hours) at the Donmar Rehearsal Rooms as part of his experimental "Theatre of Cruelty" season with the Royal Shakespeare Company; he abandoned plans to stage the complete text, partly due to dissatisfaction with Bernard Frechtman's translation.
The play's first complete performance was directed by Per Verner Carlsson at the Stadsteater in Stockholm in 1964. Its five-hour-long production required six months of rehearsal preparation.
Roger Blin directed the play's French première at the Odéon theatre in Paris, which opened on 21 April 1966. Genet became closely involved in rehearsals and published a series of letters to Blin about the theatre, the play, and the progress of its production. André Acquart designed the sets and costumes, providing via three collapsible platforms four levels which 27 gliding screens divided into different playing areas, as wells as "sumptuous and theatrical" costumes and make-up. Madeleine Renaud played Warda, Jean-Louis Barrault played the Mouth, María Casares played the Mother, and Amidou played Saïd. Blin also directed a German production in Essen in November 1967.
Minos Volanakis directed the play's US première in New York 1971. Patrice Chéreau directed a production at the Théâtre Nanterre-Amandiers in Nanterre, near Paris, in 1983. In 1989 Joanne Akalaitis directed Paul Schmidt's translation at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, with Jesse Borrego as Said, and music by Philip Glass and Foday Musa Suso.

Antoine Blanchard

Antoine Blanchard is the pseudonym under which French painter, Marcel Masson (1910–1988) painted his immensely popular Parisian street scenes. He was born in a small village near the banks of the Loire on 15 November 1910.
Education and career.
Blanchard received his initial artistic training at the Beaux-Arts in Rennes, Brittany. He then moved to Paris in 1932 where he joined the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He won the Prix de Rome.
Like Édouard Cortès (1882–1969) and Eugène Galien-Laloue (1854–1941), Antoine Blanchard essentially painted Paris and the Parisians in bygone days, often from vintage postcards. The artist began painting his Paris street scenes in the late 1950s, and like Cortès, often painted many times the same Paris landmark, in different weather conditions or various seasons. The most recurrent topics were views of the capital city in cloudy or rainy days, showing streets busy with pedestrians in a rush to go home and bright storefronts reflecting on wet streets. 
Antoine Blanchard died in 1988.
Rehs Galleries, Inc., New York City, is currently researching Blanchard's life and work for an online catalogue raisonné project.

The comic was originally published every month but this was later changed to every three weeks. The final editor was Ed Caruana.
Strip.
The comic strip was the main feature for each issue. At first, the stories in each issue featured little to no continuity between them however, as the comic progressed, full story arcs would become more prominent. Many different characters were introduced over the comics course. The comic always focused on Action Man's efforts to thwart the evil plans of his arch enemy, the mad scientist, Dr.X and his 'Council of Doom'. The first strip featured in the comic was named 'Into Action'.
2003 Arc.
2003 introduced the fictional Island X. An 'X' shaped island which was the home of Dr.X and the Council of Doom. This would become the setting for many stories for years to come. The plot focused on Dr.X building a huge Death ray on Island X which he would use to destroy capital cities across the world unless he was made world leader. Action Man had to explore Island X in his quest to find the doctor and they would have several confrontations before the final battle in issue 100. The outcome was shown in the following issue on a giant poster. A new villain named 'Antifreeze' was introduced this year.
2004 Arc.
2004 introduced two new Action Force team mates. Native American archer, Redwolf and Australian, Flynt.
The plot for this story arc centred around new villain 'No-Face' creating an army of X Robots, built in Dr.X's image, to spread terror across the world before later bringing Dr.X back to life as a cyborg. No-Face then kidnapped a scientist named Professor Moran to force him to make a mind control gas for Dr.X which would help him achieve his goal of taking over the world.
At first Professor Moran refused but Dr.X claimed he would blow up every capital city in Europe if he did not help him.
The 2004 film had a very similar plot to this story-arc.
X Missions (2005/06 Arc).
The final story arc was called X Missions. This name featured on the cover of each issue, as well as on the boxes of the action figures.The plot involved Dr.X harnessing animal DNA and using it to create 'Terror Toxin'. He planned to use this on innocent people to turn them into his Toxic Troopers. Some X Robots were also upgraded to become Toxic Robots which had blades for hands. Action Man also had to complete ten deadly missions that Dr.X had set out for him.
A direct to VHS and DVD film named was also released in 2005.
History.
Panini Comics obtained the Marvel UK licence in 1995 and Marvel UK had previously published an Action Force comic.
Then, in 1996, the first issue of Action Man was published with the Marvel logo on the cover however, this was later removed after a few years.
The comic ended in 2006 to be replaced by a spin-off, Action Man: A.T.O.M. comic. A.T.O.M. had also replaced the Action Man toy line and TV show.
Collected Editions.

St. John's Catholic Church (Fryburg, Ohio)

St. John Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church in the unincorporated community of Fryburg in Pusheta Township, Auglaize County, Ohio, United States. The parish was established in 1848, the same year in which the community was platted, and construction was completed in 1850. A Catholic school in connection with the church was established in 1877. Both buildings feature fine architecture: the church includes Gothic Revival elements such as ornate pilasters and lancet windows, while the former school is a good example of Federal architecture.
St. John's is one of many churches in western Ohio that historically has been served by the Society of the Precious Blood. It is one of the oldest extant Catholic churches in the region known as the "Land of the Cross-Tipped Churches": most contemporary churches in the region were log structures that have disappeared. Only St. Augustine's Church in Minster to the southwest remains a church, and it has been significantly modified by the addition of twin towers decades after construction. St. John retains its historic brick and stucco exterior, and its frescoed ceiling has been recognized as a leading aspect of its architecture. Throughout the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, there is only one church older than St. John's that survives without significant structural changes. St. John's and its parish hall were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, along with St. Augustine's and many other churches related to the Society of the Precious Blood in western Ohio.

P-35 radar

The P-35 (; ) also referred to by the NATO reporting name "Bar Lock" in the west is a 2D E band/F band radar developed and operated by the former Soviet Union.
Development.
The P-30 was developed by the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Radio Engineering (VNIIRT) as an early warning ground control and interception radar for the Soviet Air Defence Forces, airforce, and navy of the Soviet Union. Saturn was a development of an earlier radar design, the P-30 radar with which it shares many similarities. By 1958 the radar had completed state trials and was accepted into service, offering improved detection range and reliability than the previous P-30.
In 1961 an improved variant of the P-35 was developed, the P-35M, which featured an improved antenna layout. By 1971 a new variant of the P-35 had entered service, "sword-35". The sword-35 upgrade featured faster scanning and an improved antenna layout and polarization filters to help eliminate passive interference and improve detection of targets flying below 300 meters. Sword-35 also incorporated a limited capability to modulate pulse duration and frequency to counter active jamming. The P-35 has now been succeeded by its successor, the P-37 radar.
Description.
The P-35 is a semi-mobile radar composed of a trailer mounting the control cabin and antenna equipment, equipment being transported by truck. The antenna system of the P-35 is composed of two open frame truncated parabolic antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception, with both antenna are fed by a stacked beam composed of six feed horns. The radar uses two antenna with azimuth scanned mechanically, but unlike the previous P-30 both antenna are horizontal, the radar not using the V-beam system to determine target altitude. The right hand side of the upper antenna carried the antenna array of the IFF secondary radar, which was used to identify detected aircraft as friend or foe.
Operators.
The P-35 was operated by the Soviet Union from 1958 and though they have since become obsolete, they were passed down to successor states after the fall of the Soviet Union. The radar has been exported and continues to serve in some areas around the world.

King's Gate (Kaliningrad)

The King's Gate (Russian: "Королевские ворота", tr.: "Korolevskie vorota", German: "Königstor") is one of the former six gates that were built during the 19th century around Kaliningrad (the former German city of Königsberg). 
Architecture.
The King's Gate was originally the Gumbinnen Gate (German: "Gumbinnensche Tor"), built in 1765 at the edge of the district Neue Sorge. In 1811 it was renamed the King's Gate and was the terminus of the Königstraße boulevard. The gate was redesigned by Friedrich August Stüler in 1850. The west facade has three sandstone statues, made by sculptor Wilhelm Stürmer: nine metres above the ground to the left the Bohemian king Ottokar II is depicted, who was Königsberg's namesake. Frederick I of Prussia, Prussia's first king, follows as the middle statue. To the right Albert, Prussia's first duke and founder of the Albertina university, holds an eye over the city. Above the sculptures the coat of arms of Samland and Natangen are shown.
Damage and reconstruction.
The gate was damaged during the Second World War. Furthermore, as a first victory celebration, Soviet soldiers decapitated the statues. With the celebration of the city's 750 year existence in June 2005, the gate was renovated. A few months before the beginning of the festivities, the gate was still in a desolate condition. Within a few weeks, however, the gate was restored to its condition before the war. Fully restored statues replaced the decapitated ones on the gate with this renovation.

In 2007 Source published its 50th issue and was relaunched in a new format with additional columns and more review coverage.
Coverage.
Source is primarily concerned with social, historical or aesthetic uses of photography rather than technical or amateur photography. The magazine deals largely with art photography, in exhibition or book reviews, essays or in the portfolios of photographs it publishes. These portfolios are selected from submissions, including those from photographers who have attended the regular portfolio days the magazine has run at venues around Ireland and the UK since 1997.
However, as well as art photography the magazine is also concerned with other non-artistic uses of the medium and has in the past published essays on subjects such as police photography, pornography, satellite photographs, children's book illustration, copyright, photography and literature, and the history of photography. This approach is typified by two columns that have run since the magazine's relaunch in 2007, discussing photography in relation to 'advertising' and 'law'.
Source website.
Source has had a website since 1997. Since 2002 this has included a growing archive of all the back issue content of the magazine. Additionally it contains two projects that are specific to the website: oral history interviews and graduate photography online. The Source oral history archive consists of lengthy interviews with photographers, curators and writers about their lives and involvement in photography. These are gradually being made available as indexed audio files sometimes up to three hours in length. Graduate photography online, running since 2007 is a large gallery of the work of graduating photography students in Ireland and the UK with each student represented by a selection of their work indexed by the universities they have attended.

John Rolle (Parliamentarian)

John Rolle (1598–1648) was a Turkey Merchant and also served as MP for the Rolle family's controlled borough of Callington, Cornwall, in 1626 and 1628 and for Truro, Cornwall, in 1640 for the Short Parliament and in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. He supported the Parliamentarian side in the English Civil War.
Origins.
John Rolle was baptised 13 April 1598 at Petrockstowe, Devon, the 4th son of Robert Rolle (d. 1633) of Heanton Satchville in the parish of Petrockstowe, Devon, by his wife Joan Hele, daughter of Thomas Hele of Fleet, Devon. John was a great-grandson, in a junior line, of George Rolle (c.1486-1552) of Stevenstone, Devon, founder of the influential and wealthy Rolle family of Devon, Keeper of the Records of the Court of Common Pleas and MP for Barnstaple in 1542 and 1545. John's elder brothers included:
Career.
John Rolle was a Turkey Merchant. He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Callington in the parliaments of 1626 and 1628. In 1628 he refused to pay tonnage and poundage when King Charles I continued to levy the charge in defiance of Parliament. Silks and other goods to the value of £1,517 were seized from him by the customs authorities, and he was forced into a lengthy lawsuit in order to recover them. Writs issued by the courts on his behalf were blocked by order of the Privy Council and the Exchequer, and he was summoned by the king before the Court of Star Chamber, which the House of Commons treated as a breach of its parliamentary privilege, as it was then debating the legitimacy of seizure of merchants' goods by the crown. Rolle's property was not returned and as a result he ceased his trading activities. In 1630 following the dissolution of Parliament, Rolle was again summoned before the Star Chamber and was questioned about speeches made by him in the Commons.
In April 1640 Rolle was elected MP for Truro in the Short Parliament and was re-elected in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. He adhered to the Parliamentary cause on the outbreak of Civil War. In 1641 Parliament instructed the committee of trade to investigate his case and after some delay in 1644 it made its report, as a result of which Rolle was voted full compensation for the sum seized from him and for losses he had suffered, covering his legal expenses and his losses from his refusal to trade after 1628. The expense was met by a fine on the executors of the Farmers of Customs and on Sir William Acton, 1st Baronet, the Sheriff of London who had been in office in 1628.
Death.
Rolle died unmarried and was buried at Petrockstowe on 18 November 1648.

Cellular microbiology

Cellular microbiology is a discipline that bridges microbiology and cell biology.
The term "cellular microbiology" was coined in 1996 in a "Science" article. Cooperation and mutual dependency between microbiology and cell biology had been increasing in the years before that, and the emergence of a new discipline had been suggested and discussed in several scientific conferences.
Cellular microbiology attempts to use pathogenic microbes as tools for cell-biology research, and to employ cell-biology methods to understand the pathogenicity of microbes. Toxins and virulence factors from microbes have been used for decades to influence processes in eukaryotic cells and to study them. It has increasingly appeared that applying a purified toxin on a cell does not always provide the complete picture, and that understanding the role of the toxin in pathogenicity, the way the toxin promotes the microbe, the way the toxin is produced and the co-evolution of the toxin and its host-cell counterparts, is crucial.
Numerous eukaryotic cellular processes have been clarified using microbial "tools". A major subject in this category is the cytoskeleton. Many microbes modify and influence the synthesis or degradation of the host-cell cytoskeleton, in particular the actin network. Intracellular microbes, such as the bacteria "Salmonella" and "Shigella", elicit actin polymerization in host cells that otherwise do not internalize microbes (non-phagocytes). This causes the formation of projections that eventually engulf the bacteria. Bacteria such as "Yersinia" inhibit actin polymerization in phagocytes, thereby preventing their uptake. Cellular microbiology tries to understand these processes and how they promote infection. Other eukaryotic processes that microbes influence and that are researched using microbes are signal transduction, metabolism, vesicle trafficking, cell cycle and transcriptional regulation, to name but a few.
Recently, the field of Cellular Microbiology has been expanded to incorporate investigation of the cell biology of microbes themselves. "The field of cellular microbiology is a coalescence of two fields: molecular microbiology and cell biology," said Professor Jacek Hawiger, Chair of Microbiology and Immunology at Vanderbuilt University. Particularly in the case of bacterial cells, new technology is starting to be used to reveal a high level of organization within the bacterial cells themselves. For example, high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy are both being used to show just how sophisticated bacterial cells are.

SLSF 4018

Called a "war baby" because it was part of the build-up of cargo capacity ordered through the United States Railroad Administration during World War I, Engine No. 4018 was constructed in October 1919 to a standardized USRA Light Mikado design by the Lima Locomotive Works of Lima, Ohio for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The engine is a 2-8-2 locomotive of the USRA standard Mikado type, inherited from Japan, and is coal-fired standard gauge locomotive was capable of of tractive effort, running two cylinders under of boiler pressure. The driving wheels are in diameter and its wheelbase is . The overall length of the engine and its tender is just under . The locomotive stands tall.
Engine No. 4018 was sold to the St Louis and San Francisco Railway in 1923 and spent much of the next three decades carrying transport between Bessemer and Birmingham.
The USRA Light 2-8-2 "Mikado" design itself was later improved upon by the Lima Locomotive Works evolving into the 2-8-4 Berkshire locomotive. Part of this evolution involved increasing the size of the Mikado's firebox. This larger fire box improved the engine's coal burning efficiency, however the additional weight facility adding the second wheel set to the trailing truck.
Steam engines were phased out in favor of diesel locomotives in the mid-20th century and No. 4018 was, in fact, the last steam locomotive to operate on any part of the Frisco Railway and quite possibly the last to operate within the Birmingham metro area.
Retirement.
At the request of then-Birmingham mayor J. W. Morgan, the locomotive was saved from the scrap-yard and given a full cosmetic overhaul before making its final five-mile (8 km) run to Birmingham on February 29, 1952. A. M. Ball, assistant to the president of the Frisco line, was in attendance for the occasion.
The engine was turned over to the city on May 29 of that year. It traveled on Atlantic Coast Line Railroad trackage to the vicinity of the fairgrounds. From there a special spur was constructed of panel track to deliver it the selected spot near the "Kiddieland" amusement park. Despite one derailment, the locomotive was brought safely to its new home and a metal shed was built over it. Frisco employees were regularly sent over in the ensuing years to keep the engine in good condition.
Efforts to have the train moved to the Heart of Dixie Railroad Museum in the 1970s broke down. A later group entered negotiations to secure the locomotive for restoration and possible use on steam excursions, but were also unsuccessful.
In the late 1980s a cosmetic restoration was begun by a group of area railroad enthusiasts volunteering their labor. The bell and headlight were removed for safe-keeping during the work, which involved sheet-metal patches over rusted areas and repainting. A new front coupler knuckle was donated and installed. The effort ran out of steam, however, and was never completed - partly for lack of security at the site.
As the city of Birmingham planned a major redevelopment of the fairgrounds area in 2009, fund-raising began for moving the engine and tender to Sloss Furnaces National Historic Landmark. The move took place February 19–21, 2009. Since the move, a cosmetic restoration has been completed.
Its sister, Frisco 4003 is on the National Register of Historic Places, on display at the Fort Smith Trolley Museum in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

Songs for My Mother is the fifth studio album released by Boyzone frontman and Irish singer/songwriter Ronan Keating. The album was released on 16 March 2009 on Polydor Records, and is his first album to be released since the reunion of Boyzone.
Album information.
The album was recorded over the span of two days during Christmas 2008 at British Grove Studios. The album was recorded with his usual backing band and a live orchestra. Ronan took time out of his busy Boyzone schedule in order to record the album. The album is produced by Stephen Lipson. The album was recorded in memory of his late mother Marie Keating and also to celebrate Mother's Day. The songs that Ronan chose to record for the album are songs that he remembers his mother listening to throughout his childhood. This album also contains a new version of his own song "This Is Your Song", a track which he wrote that originally appeared as the B-Side to his very first single, "When You Say Nothing at All", and his third studio album, "Turn It On".
Chart performance.
Due to the album's release being so close to Mother's Day in the United Kingdom, the album peaked at #1 on the UK Albums Chart. It debuted at #4 on the Irish Albums Chart, before peaking at #1 on its second week of release. It also peaked at #1 in Australia. In New Zealand, the album debuted at number sixteen, jumping to number one the following week. The album spent three weeks at number one and was certified Platinum, selling over 15,000 copies.

Dani Clos

Daniel Clos Álvarez (born 23 October 1988 in Barcelona) is a Spanish racing driver who was previously the test driver for the now defunct HRT Formula One team.
Career.
Karting.
Clos was a fairly successful karter at the ICA Junior level of karting, winning firstly the Catalonian district of the Spanish ICA Junior Championship in 2001, beating a field including the brother of former Formula Three Euroseries rival Daniel Campos-Hull, Oliver. Success continued in 2002, when Dani won the Copa Campeones Trophy and finished 10th in the Italian Open Masters, against a top-quality field of drivers including Nico Hülkenberg, Sébastien Buemi, Nelson Panciatici, Oliver Oakes and Buemi's cousin Natacha Gachnang amongst others.
2003 was by far and away his best year of karting, winning both the prestigious Andrea Margutti Trophy equipped with an MGM Racing Birel beating Miguel Molina and Jules Bianchi to the flag, and the Spanish ICA Junior Championship, along with placings of 6th in the Italian Open Masters and 11th in the European Championship. 2004 saw a move up to Formula A, but he decided to dovetail it with a campaign in the Formula Junior 1600 series in Spain. He would finish 36th in the Formula A European Championship, with a solitary point. He called time on his karting career after a 30th place in the 2005 Margutti Trophy.
Formula Junior 1600 Spain.
Clos made the move into single-seaters in 2004, with a campaign in the Formula Junior 1600 championship. Clos adapted to the cars very well, and ended up a solid 4th place in the championship behind Michael Herck, Marco Barba and Arturo Llobell, with one win and four podiums along the way.
Formula Renault 2.0.
After just one season racing at 1600cc Formula Renault level, Dani moved up to the two litre cars, with a drive in both the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 for Pons Racing, and the Italian Formula Renault Championship for Facondini Racing. Clos struggled in the pan-European championship, failing to record a finish inside the top ten placings all season. His best finish came during the 11th round of the championship, at Donington Park when he recorded an 11th place finish. He was slightly more successful in the Italian series despite missing three races due to Eurocup commitments, finishing sixteenth in the championship with 28 points beating team-mate Oliver Campos-Hull in the process. His best finishes were a pair of sevenths, coming at Imola in round three, and also at Spa during round six. Clos would return to both series for a second season in 2006.
Clos moved to Jenzer Motorsport for both campaigns in 2006, hoping to give him a little more success than what he had for his previous two teams in 2005. His European campaign landed him in seventh place overall in a tightly-contested championship. He won three races, second only to champion Filipe Albuquerque's tally of four, and these wins came in succession – doing the double at Istanbul Park and winning the first race at Misano. He had originally done the double at Misano, which would have taken his tally to four in succession, however he was disqualified due to his car's diffuser height not complying with Eurocup regulations. This handed Chris van der Drift his first victory of the 2006 season.
In the Italian championship, Clos got off to a steady start with a second and two third places in the first six races which at the time of the Spa round in early June, Clos was already some way behind championship leader Adrian Zaugg, who had won five of the first six races, and had finished third in the race that he didn't win. However, the rest of the season belonged to Clos. He won eight of the last nine races to overhaul Zaugg and win the championship by 36 points in the end. He recorded four double victories at Spa, Hockenheim, Misano and Monza and finished second in the single-race meeting at Varano.
Formula Three Euroseries.
After his title win, Dani moved up to the Formula Three Euroseries for the 2007 season, signing up to drive for Signature-Plus. Clos had a solid, yet unspectacular first season with a championship position of 13th, with thirteen points. His best result was a fourth place during the reverse-grid round sixteen in Barcelona – the race now infamous with one of the biggest startline crashes in Euroseries history, in which nine cars were eliminated. He also finished fifteenth during the Masters of Formula 3 event at Zolder, finishing some four seconds behind the eventual Euroseries champion Romain Grosjean and some 42 seconds behind winner Hülkenberg.
Clos returned to the series for a sophomore season in 2008, this time moving to Prema Powerteam. However, he ended up one place lower than what he was in 2007, finishing 14th with a total of 16.5 points. He only recorded six points-scoring finishes during the season, two of which were podium finishes coming at Pau (3rd) and 2nd in the rain-shortened race at Le Mans. He would have finished level on points with Jon Lancaster on 19 points had he been awarded 5 points rather than 2.5 at Le Mans. He also recorded a fastest lap in round 2 at Hockenheim, and started round 4 at Mugello from pole, thanks to the reverse-grid system.
Formula Renault 3.5 Series.
Clos made his debut in Formula Renault 3.5 Series at Le Mans for Epsilon Euskadi, replacing Adrián Vallés, who was busy driving the Liverpool F.C. car in Superleague Formula at Zolder. In his first race, he moved from 20th on the grid, to finish tenth and pick up a championship point. He also picked up the bonus point for progressing the most spots during the race, with ten. He continued in the series at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve, picking up a point for qualifying third in his group. A ninth place finish was his best result of the weekend, which also included an incident with team-mate Chris van der Drift. He was replaced by Keisuke Kunimoto for the final two rounds.
GP2 Series.
Having tested for both GP2 Series teams and ones in the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, Clos was signed by the Racing Engineering team for the 2009 GP2 Series on 8 February 2009. He scored his first points and podium in the final race at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve, ending up 21st overall. In the off-season, he contested two rounds of the GP2 Asia Series for Trident Racing. He continued with Racing Engineering into the 2010 season. Clos became a regular podium contender in 2010, scoring points in every round and had one retirement at the Monaco sprint race. He won his maiden GP2 race at the Turkish sprint round, and as of the Hungaroring race occupied third in the championship. At the Belgian round of the championship, he suffered a compressed vertebra in a collision at the start of the feature race, and did not take part in the sprint race. Clos has remained with Racing Engineering for the 2011 season; his team-mates thus far have been Christian Vietoris and Álvaro Parente. The team also competed in the GP2 Asia Series for the first time, in which Clos, partnered with Nathanaël Berthon, scored a race win at Imola to finish ninth in the championship. In the main series, he finished ninth in the championship with a best finish of two second places.
Clos began the 2012 season without a drive, but was drafted into the Barwa Addax team after the first round of the championship, replacing Josef Král and alongside Johnny Cecotto. After four races in the seat, Král returned to take it back over.
Formula One.
Clos has been employed on a few occasions as a test driver for the Williams F1 team, the first of these came in September 2008, when he participated in a day's testing at Jerez in Spain. He tested again in December 2008 at the same circuit, for another day's testing.
Clos took also took part in the Abu Dhabi young drivers' test on 15 November 2011 at the Yas Marina Circuit. He drove 68 laps in the HRT F1 Team's F111 and ended the day 12th with a fastest time of 1’45.329.
On 13 February 2012, he was announced as the HRT F1 Team's test driver for the 2012 season. He made his race weekend début at the Spanish Grand Prix and again took part at the British, German and Hungarian Grands Prix, driving Narain Karthikeyan's car during the first free practice session on these occasions.

Kerala Express

The Kerala Express is a super fast express train of the Indian Railways that runs between New Delhi and Trivandrum Central. It is also called "King of Overtakes" because it overtakes almost every train in its route except for Rajdhanis and Shatabdhis. It is a daily train that covers a distance of 3,036 kilometers when it runs from New Delhi to Trivandrum with 40 stops at an average speed of 59 km/h. It is the longest running daily Superfast train in India and also holds the record for the longest electric engine hauled train between New Delhi and Thiruvananthapuram Central.
The train had been assigned the number 12626 for the route New Delhi to Trivandrum while it is 12625 for the route Trivandrum to New Delhi. It is a 24 coach train comprising 7 AC coaches (2 Two Tier AC, 5 Three Tier AC), 12 SL coaches, 4 General Coaches and a Pantry Car. This train is usually hauled by WAP 4 of Erode shed and also has a top speed of 110 kmph.
History.
It was introduced in the year 1976 as Kerala-Karnataka Express (KK Express) starting from New Delhi to Trivandrum and Bangalore, with bifurcation at Jolarpettai Jn. In 1980, it was split into two trains, Kerala Express and Karnataka Express with Kerala Express again split at Palghat Jn and one of the portions diverted to Mangalore. It overlapped with the Jayanti Janata which bifurcated at Shoranur with one part of the train going to Cochin Harbour and the other to Mangalore. Later, these two trains were merged to form the Kerala Mangala Exp. In 1990, after a separate train to Mangalore was introduced, it began to run along its present route. It was a non daily train initially and had shared the same time slot with the Tamil Nadu Express, Andhra Pradesh Express and the Karnataka Express. However, after its conversion into a daily train it received its own time slot.
It originally was numbered 125/126 but was later changed to 2625/2626 in 1989 after the Indian Railways adopted the four-digit numbering system. In December 2010, the Indian Railways adopted the five-digit numbering system by which the Kerala Express is currently numbered 12625 for upward journey and 12626 for downward journey.

<doc id="21450646" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21450646" title="Old Aunt Jemima">
Old Aunt Jemima

"Old Aunt Jemima" was a popular American song composed by African American comedian, songwriter and minstrel show performer Billy Kersands (c. 1842–1915). The Old Aunt Jemima song was the inspiration for the Aunt Jemima brand of pancakes, as well as several characters in film, television and on radio named "Aunt Jemima".
Kersands wrote his first version of "Old Aunt Jemima" in 1875. It was to become Kersands' most popular song. Robert Toll claimed that Kersands had performed this song over 2000 times by 1877. There were at least 3 different sets of "Old Aunt Jemima" lyrics by 1889.
Often "Old Aunt Jemima" would be sung while a man in drag playing the part of Aunt Jemima performed on stage. It was not uncommon for the Aunt Jemima character to be played by a white man in blackface.
Other minstrels incorporated Aunt Jemima into their acts, so Aunt Jemima became a common figure in minstrelsy. Other songs about Aunt Jemima were composed, such as "Aunt Jemima Song" and "Aunt Jemima's Picnic Day".
Lyrics.
One version of "Old Aunt Jemima" began with a stanza expressing dissatisfaction with the dullness of worship services in white churches, such as a complaint about the length of the prayers. The song ended with the following two stanzas:
"The monkey dressed in soldier clothes,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"Went out in the woods for to drill some crows,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"The jay bird hung on the swinging limb,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"I up with a stone and hit him on the shin,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"Oh, Carline, oh, Carline,"
"Can't you dance the bee line,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"The bullfrog married the tadpole's sister,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"He smacked his lips and then he kissed her,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"She says if you love me as I love you,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"No knife can cut our love in two,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"Oh, Carline, oh, Carline,"
"Can't you dance the bee line,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
Some variants of the song substituted "pea-vine" for "bee line". Another version included the verse:
"My old missus promise me,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"When she died she-d set me free,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"She lived so long her head got bald,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
"She swore she would not die at all,"
"Old Aunt Jemima, oh! oh! oh!"
Sterling Stuckey maintains that Kersands did not write all of these lyrics, but adapted many of them from "slave songs" (such as field hollers and work songs).

Siripudi

Siripudi is a small village located in Nagaram mandal, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh, India.
The village of Siripudi has a Government school, and a temple which is almost 100 years old.
Siripudi Ramalayam.
Siripudi Ramalayam was established in the year 1916 by Sri Maddali Sastrulu. To this date, this continues to be the only temple in Siripudi. Sri Maddali Krishna Murthy has been the trustee of this temple and has been responsible for renovating it, starting with the installation of a dwajasthambam in 1973.
Temple history.
The history of this Temple can be traced back to about 1916 AD. Legend has it that a సన్యాసి (Sanyaasi) was on a routine tour and happened to visit Siripudi, on his way. Sri Maddali Sastrulu, owing to his age and intellect was considered to be the village seer at that time. His house was situated in the middle of the village in about an acre of land. The house consisted of stoned walls, clay tiled roof and the same was always green with Mango trees, a variety of fruit bearing trees, and flowering plants. In addition to that, it had the required facilities to accommodate visitors. For this reason, any visitor would typically visit his place and take shelter there. The Sanyaasi was welcomed and received well into Maddali Sastrulu's house. Siripudi being a small village, word quickly spread out that a pious man was in the village, and everybody assembled in Sastrulu's house to catch a glimpse of the Sanyaasi and invite him to their house for biksha (బిక్ష). By this time, the Sanyaasi had not even consumed a drop of water. In response to the villagers request for biksha (బిక్ష) in their houses, the Sanyaasi mentioned that he would first visit the temple in their village, and only after that would he visit the villagers houses for alms. With this, the Sanyaasi proceeded towards the temple, which never existed in that village! On being told there existed no temple in the village of Siripudi, the Sanyaasi walked away from the village mentioning that he would not touch a drop of water in a village that lacked a temple.
Temple founders.
The 'Sanyaasi' incident left a deep impression in the minds of all the villagers of Siripudi. It was clear that a temple was required in the village. To begin with, the temple needed land, and nobody in the village was ready to donate any of their land. In addition to that, materials like bricks, clay and motor were not readily available at that time. At the same time, the villagers were not ready to forgo the idea of temple construction given that it is an act related to God. Because the 'Sanyaasi' incident happened in Sastrulu's house, it was unanimously decided that he was to take charge and responsibility of building the temple.
At that time, there was an existing practice in place which allowed the District Collector to allot land that fell under the Government Thaluka jurisdiction to the poor and landless. Sastrulu's eldest son in law who was at that time employed in Repalle Thaluka office as a clerk, suggested that the villagers of Siripudi file a request for allotment of land under the above mentioned practice. Once the land was allotted, of land was to be donated to the proposed temple. Thus, of land that primarily consisted of sand heaps ended up being the location for construction of temple. Because the responsibility with filing of requests for allotment of land on behalf of the poor, following up on it, and securing the land fell with Sastrulu, it was decided that the rest of the work which involved construction of the temple etc., was entrusted with him.
Although the task of securing land for the temple was accomplished, the task of constructing the temple still remained. It was not an easy task of getting it done only by Sastrulu. His property included of agriculture land, and two bullock carts. He had two individuals employed with him to take care of his agriculture related work. With the help of his bullock carts and the two individuals employed with him, he managed to obtain clay from the agricultural canal, mold bricks out of it, cut and dry branches from his mango trees, and managed to burn them to manufacture bricks for constructing the temple. This way, construction of the temple was accomplished.
Installation of Idols was done in 1916 (నలనామా సంవత్సరం). Activities like every day offerings to deity (నైవేద్యం), lighting of the wicks (డీపారాధాన) and others were performed by Sastrulu on his own expense, during his lifetime, until 1942. After him, the responsibility of managing and taking care of the temple fell on his adopted son Maddali Krishna Murthy. By this time Sastrulu's property of diminished to . Maddali Krishna Murthy at that time was based out of Guntur and was pursuing Intermediate Studies. Owing to a job posting outside of Siripudi, all that Krishna Murthy could do was send money to the priest (ఆర్చకుడు) of the temple and have him perform and celebrate the various functions and festivals. However, for Sri Rama Navami (శ్రీ రామ నవమి), he would visit Siripudi and take part in Talambralu (తలంబ్రాలు).
The situation was such that the village did not have a single visitor to the temple who would offer a Single Paisa to the God nor would he offer a single coconut, for that matter. There was no proper accommodation available for the priest of the temple. Given this situation, and with the owner of the temple not based out of the village, the temple ended up being a meeting place for the folklore of the village to settle their quarrels. Also, the villagers seized this opportunity to cultivate the land belonging to the Temple without taking permission from the temple.
Temple renovation.
Temple construction in 1916 was primarily done through self made bricks and lime mortar. With passage of time, the structure had begun to deteriorate and was almost in the verge of collapse. Because Krishna Murthy belonged to the temple founders family, and because he took up the moral responsibility of maintaining it, he took up the task of renovating it, although he was financially incapable of executing it.
There exists a water route from Kolanukonda to Pittalavanipalem. Siripudi is about two miles (3 km) from Pittalavanipalem, and there existed no road at that time. Courtesy Machiraju Seetarama Swamy, who negotiated a deal with the local gentry and farmers of Pittalavanipalem, they were able to transport the required mountain rock and lime mortar required for renovating the temple, for free given that this was an act related to God. Similarly, Sri Goparaju Chalapathi Rao of Ponnur helped transport the required wood and stone for renovating the ceiling. Thus, with the procured material, the temple was successfully renovated.

Translation of The Lord of the Rings into Swedish

The translations of "The Lord of the Rings" into Swedish have been the subject of controversy.
Ohlmarks' translation.
Åke Ohlmarks (1911–1984) was a prolific translator, who during his career published Swedish versions of Shakespeare, Dante and the Qur'an. His translation of "The Lord of the Rings", however, was intensely disliked by author J. R. R. Tolkien, more so even than Shuchart's Dutch translation, as is evident from a 1957 letter to Rayner Unwin:
Examples singled out by Tolkien in the same letter:
Other dubious translations include "Vattnadal" "Water-dale" for "Rivendell", apparently by way of taking "riven" for "river". "Snigelöv" "Snail-leavings" for "Esgaroth", apparently by association with French "escargot" "snail".
The Ent "Quickbeam" becomes "Snabba solstrålen" "Swift Sunbeam", apparently taking "beam" in the sense of "beam of light" in spite of all Ents having "arboreal" names. Ohlmarks also appears to have forgotten what choices he had already made, and renders "Isengard" variously as "Isengard", "Isengård", "Isendor" or "Isendal".
In terms of style, Ohlmark's prose is hyperbolic and laden with poetic archaisms even where the original uses simple or even laconic language. The translation also contains numerous factual errors, straightforward mistranslations of idiomatic expressions and other non-sequiturs, such as
Ohlmarks' translation remained the only one available in Swedish for forty years, and until his death in 1984, Ohlmarks remained impervious to the numerous complaints and calls for revision from readers.
After "The Silmarillion" was published in 1977, Christopher Tolkien consented to a Swedish translation only on the condition that Ohlmarks have nothing to do with it. After a fire in his home in 1982, Ohlmarks incoherently charged Tolkien fans with arson, and subsequently he published a book connecting Tolkien with "black magic" and Nazism, including fanciful constructions such as deriving the name "Saruman" from "SA man" with an interposed "Ruhm" "glory", and conspiracy theories surrounding the Tolkien Society.
2005 translation.
Ohlmarks' translation has only been superseded in 2005 by a new translation by Erik Andersson with poems interpreted by Lotta Olsson. This translation is considered much closer to the original, and abides by Tolkien's instructions. In the translation process, Andersson had access to a team of Tolkien fans as advisors. In 2007, Andersson together with John Swedenmark translated "The Hobbit", making it the third Swedish translation of this book, but the first time that "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" were available in Swedish from the same translator.
The translation project attracted great interest from both Tolkien fans and Swedish media in general. In 2007 Andersson published a book called "Översättarens anmärkningar" ("The translator's notes") based on his diary during the project.

Baumhauerite

Baumhauerite (Pb3As4S9) is a rare lead sulfosalt mineral. It crystallizes in the triclinic system, is gray-black to blue-gray and its lustre is metallic to dull. Baumhauerite has a hardness of 3.
Baumhauerite occurs as small crystals embedded in dolomitic marble. It is found primarily in the Lengenbach Quarry, Binnental, in the Valais region of Switzerland, the mineral is named after German mineralogist Heinrich Baumhauer (1848–1926), who discovered it at Lengenbach, famous among mineralogists for its array of rare minerals, in 1902. Baumhauerite has also been reported at Sterling Hill, New Jersey, United States, typically in association with molybdenite, and in aggregates at Hemlo, Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.

Morris Talpalar (May 28, 1900 – July 7, 1979) was an American sociologist. He was the author of The Sociology of Colonial Virginia (1960) and The Sociology of the Bay Colony (1976), covering American history of the period between 1600 and 1770. Among Talpalar's merits is his emphasis in describing characters and human values predominant in the colony, and how they influenced the ideological background for the war. He supported that a change in these values was determinant for the establishment of slavery in Virginia, when the original Puritan rulers that dominated the political scene before 1660 were replaced by the rules of Cavaliers. This transition was the basis for the shift from traditional indentured servitude to slavery (temporarily versus permanent unfree labor) that was implemented in the colony. All these contributions have been considered as unique for their objectivity and originality.

Villa Porto (Vivaro di Dueville)

Villa Porto in Vivaro di Dueville (Province of Vicenza) is a villa veneta designed in 1554 and traditionally attributed to the Italian architect Andrea Palladio, but not included by UNESCO in the strict list of Palladian Villas of Veneto within the World Heritage Site City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto.
In 1554 Paolo Porto and his brothers divided up their father’s inheritance, Paolo acquiring an estate at Vivaro, north of Vicenza. Here, during the subsequent four years, he realised a villa which tradition holds was designed by Palladio. The Conte Paolo Porto, one of the most powerful canons of the Cathedral (in 1550 he was on the point of becoming bishop) was a sophisticated and cultured man, who passed much time in Rome where he could count on the friendship of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Porto also numbered among his Vicentine friends and relatives Palladio’s foremost patrons, men like Giangiorgio Trissino, Biagio Saraceno, Bernardo Schio and Girolamo Garzadori. It is perhaps this network of friendships which most easily placed him in contact with Palladio, although in this regard careful inspection of the villa’s architecture raises more doubts than certainties. For one discerns various successive constructional phases, which render the identification of an original Palladian scheme, if any, most difficult. The pronaos, for example, is grafted onto the main block with manifest discontinuity. Moreover, the two lateral wings are without doubt nineteenth-century, and actually the product of a belated “Palladianization” of the villa at the hands of the architect Antonio Caregaro Negrin.

The Conservatoire botanique national de Mascarin (12.5 hectares) is a national conservatory and botanical garden located at 2, rue du Père Georges, Colimaçons, Saint-Leu, Réunion, France. It is open daily except Monday; an admission fee is charged.
The conservatory was established in 1986 as the "Conservatoire et Jardin Botanique de Mascarin" on farmland belonging to the family of the Marquis Antoine Sosthène Armand de Châteauvieux, at an elevation of 500 meters on the leeward side of La Réunion. In 1993 it was given its current name as it became one of France's eight "Conservatoires Botaniques Nationaux". In 1996 its mission changed focus from conservation within its gardens, and the cultivation and the propagation of rare and threatened plants endemic to La Réunion, to a primary emphasis on management and monitoring of species in their natural habitats.
The conservatory's ongoing projects include establishing plots in mid-elevation wet forests for long-term study of plant diversity and vegetation dynamics; field surveys to determine locations for rare endemics (such as the highly endangered "Ruizia cordata" and "Carissa xylopicron"; replanting the endangered "Lomatophyllum macrum" in situ; and seed germination studies of endemic plants including "Hugonia serrata" and "Antirhea borbonica".
The conservatory's garden (3 hectares) contains about 4,000 plant species endemic to the Mascarene Islands, i.e., including Madagascar, Mauritius, and Rodrigues, as well as Réunion itself. It is organized into seven sections as follows:

Everything on Red is a British punk rock band.
Biography.
Formed in early 2007, Everything on Red play their own unique brand of punk rock. Switching from rapid rhythms to anthemic breakdowns in a heartbeat, frenetic drums and solid bass-work provide the backbone for electrifying synths, crunching guitars and a triple-pronged vocal attack.
With the release of the "Everything on Red" EP, through CFP Records, the band are intent on changing the face of an increasingly state music scene. Each of the four tracks are a testament to the passion and drive of each band member. Their influences are never obvious, but combine to create the rich, diverse sound which is unleashed during every live show.
Press.
"Perhaps all punk influenced bands can learn something from Everything on Red; as not only are they keeping alive the spirit and passion of punk, but they have the guts and talent to take it somewhere new, therefore allowing it to grow and to progress." (Altsounds 9/10 - Recommended Band)
“Everything on Red have a really diverse, rich sound. The vocals are well thought out and the use of harmonies, especially on 'Absinthe Makes The Heart Grow Fonder' suggests a band who are extremely talented…This four-track EP is quite brief but showcases a band full of good ideas. There are choruses, solid song structures and plenty of singalong moments. Inventive and original…EOR could be ones to watch.” (Punktastic)
3.5/5
"Neveroddoreven is the first track that comes crashing into your sound-space with a frantic rhythm that Rage Against The Machine would be proud of, propelled along with a lovely organ/keyboard sound that reminds me of The Doors, a prevailing sound throughout this tight self-titled EP." (thebeatsurrender 3/5)
"UK Alt Rockers Everything on Red are certainly chock-full of ideas. Channelling the gang vocals of early Taking Back Sunday, the melodic choruses of AFI, and the affinity for time changes of At the Drive-In...Given room to breathe on a full length, this literate bunch may soon be making waves in the post punk scene." (Rocksound Exposure)
"Bringing to mind bands such as Minus The Bear, Death Cab For Cutie, Enter Shikari and elements of Thirty Seconds to Mars, these fellas could indeed be set for big things!" (thesugarmill.co.uk)
"Everything on Red specialise in incredibly tight, complex arrangements played with bags of energy, admirable flair and astounding timing... To see them is to experience a musical fairground ride of the type that turns your knuckles snow white." (Stoke Sounds website)
"They fuse electric sounds and rock to make a kaleidoscope of sound, flitting between styles like a trip down a DNA strand of the alternative genre...this is definitely a band to watch." (Sleepwalkers Magazine)

History of Rijeka

Rijeka or Fiume is located in the northern tip of the Quarnero in the northern Adriatic.
Origins.
The region of Quarnero (Fiume was still not mentioned) fell within the Holy Roman Empire, with the acquisition of the titles of Margraves of Istria and Dukes of Merania by the Andechs family. The possession was called Merania ( – "sea") and was thus meaning "littoral" ().
The counts of Duino (Tibein), were the first feudal lords of Fiume, from early 12th century until 1337. As ministeriales of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, the family proved crucial in extending German control preventing further expansion of the Republic of Venice on the northernmost Adriatic. The counts of Duino included the city into a comparatively good road network, which were in operation on the routes leading towards the sea. The Fiuman "Terra" was their most important fief, that with its possession controlled a good road network from the river Timavo to the Quarnero gulf. Along these roads, marked by several castles and outposts (Senožeče, Gotnik (Guettenegg) and Prem) guarding the land communications from the Quarnero towards Carniola, the contemporary Slovenia. Traders are reported from Carinthian Villach, Carniolan Ljubljana (Laibach) and Styrian Ptuj (Pettau) but also from the German lands of the Holy Roman Empire.
In Fiume the local toponymy is predominantly Slavic Croatian, Italians came from the sea, usually as craftsmen and traders, from the central Italian Adriatic ports, such as Fermo, Ancona, Senigallia, and with Venice. The trade of Fiume develops in linking the German lands with central Italian ports. Notably, the contacts with Croatia were very scarce given the absence of land connections of Fiume with its eastern hinterland.
In 1399, the territory fell into the hands of the German family of Walsee, the last of whom sold the territory to the Habsburgs in 1465. After the extinction of the house of the Walsee in 1465, the possessions were inherited by the Habsburg family that owned it from 1466 to 1776. The Habsburgs granted Fiume with the status of a free city, and included in the Duchy of Carniola.
As a "reichsfrei" city, or territory (Fiume was a "terra") was under the direct authority of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Imperial Diet, without any intermediary liege lord(s). Advantages were that "reichsfrei" regions had the right to collect taxes and tolls themselves, and held juridical rights themselves. De facto imperial immediacy corresponded to a semi-independence with a far-reaching autonomy. In 1599 Fiume "de facto" becomes an independent City commune, emancipated from the Duchy of Carniola, although the Carniolan Estates will continue (unsuccessfully) to claim their rights upon the city – right up to their cessation in 1809.
The late mediaeval Commune was ruled according to the Statute from 1530 but this chart formally lasted until 1850. The first codified Statute of Fiume preserves some features of the mediaeval Croatian statutes, still with a preponderance of Italian and Venetian institutions. According to the Statute, the executive power was in the hand of the "Gran Consiglio" ("Great council") with 50 members and the "Piccolo Consiglio" ("Small council") of 25 patricians. The Captain was the representative of the feudal lord (from 1466 the Habsburg archduke). The local executives, "giudici rettori" ("justice rectors"), have to obey only the lord – from 1466 the duke (later Emperor) of the House of Habsburg. Thus, in its local corporate representation Fiume was a mixture between the local self-government tradition and the "Reichsfreiheit" or "Reichsunmittelbarkeit" of the free cities of the Holy Roman Empire.
Turkish wars.
Fiume by the 19th century had arisen as the most important port for the eastern half of the Habsburg empire, but its beginnings are modest: at the dawn of the modern age it was still a small port city, with less than 5000 inhabitants.
The Kingdom of Croatia, with whom the city bordered along the eastern shores of its river, merged with the Kingdom of Hungary, after the disaster of the Battle of Mohács in 1526. Both kingdoms accepted the sovereignty of the Habsburgs to defend from the Turkish conquests. Following 1526, the stretch of territory south of Fiume and north of the Zrmanja river (called the Littoral) was held by the House of Austria – inheritor of the Crowns of Croatia and Hungary. Southwards, Venetian Dalmatia spread up to Cattaro. As such these lands were permanently put on a frontline, intended to bring to a halt the Ottoman advance that stopped short of the gulf of Quarnero.
Until the late 17th century, the Habsburg monarchy was essentially a landlocked territory: trade and traffic had followed the commercial routes to the North and Northwest, and Hamburg was the main port for Austrian products. When these routes became increasingly blocked by the growing Prussian state, the Monarchy started to turn towards its southern possessions. The trade of the City still languished since the Habsburgs retraced to Trieste all the Austrian exports, also because of the insecurity of land communications thorough Fiume.
Turkish attacks and intrusion in Croatia and the surroundings of Fiume, were particularly frequent from 1469 to 1502, helped by the near absence of any organised defence. The threat from the Ottoman Empire which kept the monarchy engaged in permanent military actions and in concluding coalitions with Christian allies and Venice was one of these. The northern Adriatic thus functioned as something as an Ottoman, Venetian, and Habsburg borderland’s littoral.
The border itself was a very fuzzy and mobile concept in the region for centuries: the Croatian Littoral and its hinterland were an integrated part of the Habsburg Military Frontier which was more than a defensive institution and marked all the stages of societal development in the area. Its principal characteristic was that the various fortresses were manned with regular and irregular troops for a permanent low intensity warfare which included raiding as its main source of revenues. Incursions of armed bands both form the Ottoman side the irregular Hajduks and Uskoks as well as the local Military Frontier troops (Grenzer) were conducted on a daily basis.
Probably no phenomenon describes the turbulent events in the area better than the rise of the Uskok’s piracy and banditry in the northern Adriatic. Uskoks served as irregulars in the Habsburg border garrison of Senj for a century. The Habsburg and the Pope celebrated their role as bulwark of Christendom, while for the Venetians (laics and priests alike) they were “bandits and pirates worse than the Turks and responsible for innumerable atrocities”. Fiume’s history is very much that of the Uskoks for much of the 16th century. In fact the City survived as a port of trade principally thanks to afflux of the merchandise they robbed. It was a world of precarious life and insecurity where trade degenerated into a raiding economy. Venetia, knowing that the Uskoks had Fiume as their main “emporium”, sacked and burned the City in 1530 in a punitive expedition. Uskok piracy aroused as a serious diplomatic problem between Austria and Venetia and was settled in 1612 with the Treaty of Vienna with whom the Emperor refused any support to the Uskoks.
The repeated attempts of Habsburg emperors to expand and enlarge the tiny fishing villages of the northern Adriatic into functioning ports had previously failed because of the domination of Venice that controlled the entire Adriatic and fiercely opposed the development of the Habsburg ports. Even that did not prevent a series of Venetian occupations and destruction of Fiume, from 1508 to 1512, 1530, 1599 and, finally, in 1612. The maritime traffic was reduced to cabotage, since the Serenissima controlled all ships leaving the ports. Habsburg emperors unsuccessfully tried to break this domination of the sea, claiming free shipping for all and formulating it in treaties and diplomatic agreements.
Only with the pacification of the Turks, which seemed realisable for the first time at the end of the 17th century, could new attempts be undertaken. At the end of the 17th century the Ottomans are defeated and with the Treaty of Karlovitz (1699) the Empire regains control over the vast plains of Vojvodina and Banat promptly put under the direct control of the Imperial Chamber (Kaiserliche Hofkammer) of Inner Austria with seat in Graz as the Imperial Regency, to finance the military needs against the Ottomans.
The origins of the emporium.
The origins of the emporium are to be located in the late 17th century when a mercantilist program starts to find its way into the Habsburg lands. Already in year 1666, under Emperor Leopold I, in Vienna a Commerzcollegium was founded, an office with the main function of initiating some economic reforms and the control of their execution. Based upon mercantilistic principles, a homogeneous “Littoral district” was to be created along the Adriatic coast.
Besides the local and, up to that time, unimportant ports of Trieste and Fiume, the plan also encompassed the integration of Croatian territories, which had been seized from the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the 17th century: the Gulf of Bakar, Senj and Karlobag where the Habsburgs met the competition of the local powerful landlords who started to develop as ports some of the coastal towns they owned. The Zrinski (Zriny) were the most powerful landowners in Croatia and most of the land that surrounded Fiume (as well as the city of Bakar (Buccari) was in their hands. They developed the port of Buccari, the best natural harbour in the area, comparatively well connected with the hinterland. Alliance with Venice and much lower taxes explain the success of Buccari, where soon the rise in traffic vastly outnumbered that of the Habsburg port of Fiume. Buccari had a lazaretto, founded by a Venetian company. The other family were the Frankopan (Frangipane) who owned and developed the port of Kraljevica (Portorè). These developments came to an abrupt end with the Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy. After the end of the rebellion in 1673, that resulted in their defeat all these possessions were confiscated and put under the control of the Hungarian Aulic Chamber, soon transferred to the Imperial Chamber of Inner Austria. The destruction of the most powerful feudal families and their economic might ensured that no similar event would take place during the feudal era. Between Vienna and the Adriatic ports there were no feudal lords capable of competing or disturbing the plans of economic development. One of the big obstacles for the implementation of these policies was the Venetian monopoly on the Adriatic which effectively prevented ships form other countries to fare freely on this closed sea at the time known also as the “Gulf of Venice”. Success was achieved under Charles VI. In 1717 after another victorious campaign against the Ottomans (but this time with Venice as its ally) the Adriatic see was promptly declared free for trade, with Venice no longer opposing it; in 1718 peace was concluded with the Ottoman Empire and a commercial treaty brought important commercial liberties to the Ottoman and Habsburg subjects; in 1719 Trieste and Fiume were declared Free Ports of the Empire of the Habsburgs.
In 1723 the “Gran Consiglio” of the Fiuman commune was put under the Circle of Inner Austria with the seat in Graz. The Captain as a representative of the Emperor still holds the executive power for the governmental economic policy. Progressively, Fiume will be included in broader institutional frameworks, aimed at economic development of the whole empire, but growingly of its Hungarian part. That Hungarian influence was on the rise is reflected also in fact that Fiume, as a Free City, accepted the Pragmatic Sanction, in 1723 – the same year as the Hungarian Diet, while the “sister city” of Trieste did it ten year earlier in 1713 - as the other Habsburg lands. Trieste was intended in Charles VI plans to link Austrian lands with his remaining Spanish possessions – Naples. Fiume had to provide a link with Hungary and the Banat of Temesvar where the colony of Spanish exiles of Nova Barcelona was to be founded.
The operation was entrusted to Ramon de Vilana Perlas Marques de Rialp (1663-1741), Spanish Sec. of State to Emperor Charles VI, who until his resignation in 1737 was "secretario de estado y de despacho" - the executive of the Spanish and Belgian councils and coordinated diplomatic relations involving the Emperor's Italian and Belgian outposts.
The project failed, but links of Fiume with the Banat of Temesvar remained strong.
Under the reign of Maria Theresa (1740–1780), in 1741 in Vienna is formed the "Comercien Ober Directorium " upon which all the commercial affairs of the empire is centred. In 1745 she united the administrations of all the ports within an "Oberste Commerz-Intendenza" (High Commercial Intendancy), which was originally established by her father in 1731.
Fiume, instead of a Kreisamt, subordinated to the Gubernium, has a "Direzione Superiore Commerciale" (Kommerzassesorium) subordinated to the "Cesarea Regia Intendenza Commerciale per il Litorale", seated in Trieste. The Intendenza was the first provincial imperial institution that ruled the City from 1748 until 1776. In 1749 Maria Theresa issued the Haupt Resolution by which the civil and military Capitan of Trieste is put under the control of the Comercien Ober Directorium seated in Vienna. All the region of the Littoral in fact becomes a territorial dependency of this new institution, specifically oriented to the development of commerce and thus very different from the other (still feudal) provinces. From 1753 the "Intendenza Capitanale di Fiume Tersatto e Buccari", executes the orders from the head office in Trieste. The Fiuman “Luogotenente” of the "Cesarea Regia Luogotenenza Governale del Capitanato di Fiume, Tersatto e Buccari", had also the role of the previous captain, and his jurisdiction is extended and goes form Moschienizze to Carlopago. The Intendenza transmits the orders to the Justice Rectors in Fiume. Thereby the autonomy of the local institutions (the Justice Rectors previously were at the top of the communal administration) was gradually reduced.
Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor also founded a “privileged company” in Fiume. The purpose of these measures was to attract foreign investments, but the first companies were controlled from the chamber in Vienna and went bankrupt. The turn came in 1750, with the foundation of the Urban Arnold & comp. company, with the seat in Antwerp. Initially it dealt with the refinement of sugar, and the production of potash and tallow candles. It also possessed its own port basin and the number of its sugar refining plants grew from one to five. Soon, already in 1754, the Company supplies the while monarchy with sugar that becomes its main traded article. The company was bigger than anything Fiume had previously seen. It employed more than 1000 workers and employees in a time when the city had little more than 5000 inhabitants. Apart from sugar the company produced salted meat. The company bring new life to Fiuman economy and started many spin-offs (candle and rope factories, etc.). Industrial production in the city rose rapidly: in 1771 it was valued at 802,582 guldens, in 1780 2,278,000. the value of imports in 1771 was 1,187,000 guldens, in 1780 2,781,000 guldens. Exports value in 1771 was 496,000 guldens, in 1780 1,340,000 guldens, but probably they were even higher: according to the Ragusan diplomat Luka Sorkočević who in 1782 stayed in Fiume in his private diary estimated the added value of the fiuman economy (based on the value of its exported goods) at 2,5 million guldens.
Corpus Separatum.
During the 1740s most of the trade from the Pannonian plain was starting to pass over Fiume and not Dubrovnik (Ragusa), which after the retreat of the Ottoman empire, never regained the lost ground. After a series of formal acts of protest of the Hungarian and Croat Landed Estates, Joseph II during his journey through Croatia, the Littoral and Venice in 1775, which was carried out one year later, in 1776, decided the abolition of the ‘Litorale Austriaco’. In the same year the “Provincia Mercantile” was suspended. In 1776, the City of Fiume and the Croatian seaboard, which had previously been under the same administration as the rest of the Austrian littoral, is annexed to the Kingdom of Croatia, with a Maria Theresa Handschrift. The Empress donated these lands and possessions to Croatia – Hungary as a compensation since many of their lands were put under the direct imperial administration as the osterreichische Militargrenze (Military Frontier) against the Turks, exclusively for defensive purposes.
Maria Theresa, with her sovereign decision from October the 2nd 1776, gave up the possession of Fiume, that so far belonged to the Habsburgs, and give it to the Hungarian kingdom, with a view of fostering its trade. Since Hungary proper was distant some 500 km, according to the act, understandably, the city was annexed to Croatia whose territory began right beyond the city walls.
Although Croatia, as a kingdom, was united with Hungary and together they formed the “Lands of the Holy Crown of St Stephen”, the Fiumani protested, and with support of the Hungarian Vice Regency Council, two and a half years later, Maria Theresa (as Queen of Hungary) enacted the royal rescript on April, the 23rd 1779, with whom Fiume was annexed to Hungary directly as a "corpus separatum adnexum sacra hungaricae coronae".
From that moment on the two kingdoms never ceased to batter on the issue whose was Fiume. The Fiumani, as a third part, gave their reading that Fiume (or better: the corpus separatum) was autonomous from both. Given the institutional instability that characterized the whole period from 1779 up to 1848, this was more or less true.
Fiume retained the autonomous status from the surrounding territory it enjoyed with the Habsburgs, since the function of the Governor was preserved, and who was now always drawn from the ranks of the Hungarian aristocracy. Fiume was the only city in Hungary (Croatia included) that had such an institution. The development of the port needed huge investments that only Hungary could offer and the leaning of all the local forces towards Hungary appears inevitable.
The Gubernium of Fiume.
The territory was to form the new comitatus of Severin that also included all the confiscated possessions of the Frangipane and Zrinski families that surrounded Fiume in the interior. Trieste now became the only harbour of the German hereditary lands. Fiume became fully independent from Trieste in all-commercial, fiscal and administrative matters as the main port of Hungary, which meant excluding the city from the Holy Roman Empire, and here a "Gubernium" was installed too, while the other ports were annexed to Croatia.
The inclusion of Fiume into Croatia arouse a series of protests from the fiuman notables, promptly supported by the Hungarian estates. In fact already in 1776, when it was decreed to include Fiume to Hungary through Croatia, it was the count József Majláth, acting as Hungarian royal commissar, who took over the town from baron Pasquale Ricci, the representative of the Intendancy from Trieste.
Shortly after that, (with the rescript of the queen dated 23 April 1779) the City is officially directly annexed to Hungary as a "corpus separatum") (i.e.: not as a part of Croatia, that was in a personal union with Hungary). Since Fiume had to serve a similar “emporial” function for Hungary as Trieste did for the Habsburg lands, the Hungarian estates (and most probably the Queen) wanted to grant the City a similar degree of institutional autonomy as that enjoyed by Trieste.
According to the rescript from 1779, Fiume was considered to be a corpus separatum – that is a political body with a greater autonomy than a royal free City, or a comitatus, but a territory comparable to the other partes adnexae constituting the Crown of the St. Stephen. Its position was thus comparable to those of the regna, as Trieste was considered to be a crown land of the imperial hereditary lands (Erblande) so Fiume was considered to be a partes adnexa to the crown.
After the royal rescript from the 23rd April 1779, the stage for all the political confrontations that will happen in Fiume was set for more than a century and a half. In a sense it can be said that all history that followed was a long footnote on how to interpret this two acts from 1776 and 1779. The act presented a precedent for the Hungarian constitutional praxis, since it was the first time that a part of the Holy Roman Empire (and a hereditary fief of the Habsburgs) was given to the Hungarian-Croatian kingdom. Therefore, since the Croatian and Hungarian estates had widely diverging interests with respect to Fiume, they produced very different interpretations of the rescript.
The Croatians refused to accept the Hungarian reading of the document – they denied that the City could have been excluded from the surrounding territory, that was already framed into a comitatus. Since the Croatian estates never accepted this interpretation, the constitutional position of the City was always somehow imprecise. On the other hand, the change happened when the Croatian diet voted for the suspension of the short-lived Croatian Vice-regency Council in Vienna whose prerogatives were now entirely devolved to the Hungarian Vice-regency Council, now the supreme administrative authority for Croatia as well.
Fiume becomes the administrative centre for two very different – and overlapping – administrative units: The Gubernium of Fiume and the Comitatus of Severin (Severinska Županija), that is an integral part of Croatia. Arguably the simultaneous existence of the two competing offices reflects the still unsettled dispute between the Hungarian and the Croat estates. The predictable outcome of this clash came in 1787, when Joseph II dissolved the County of Severin confirming its transitory nature and introduces a new province (instead of a constituted comitatus of nobles): The “Hungarian Littoral” which now extends from Fiume to Senj. And in Fiume the “Cesareo Regio Governatorato per il Litorale in Fiume” governs the whole new province of the “Hungarian Littoral” (Litorale ungarico), thereby eliminating the Croatian competencies in this stretch of land.
For the first time in 1790, unofficially, the representatives of Fiume took part at the gathering of the Hungarian parliament. They claimed the annexation to Hungary, but it was postponed three times by the Habsburg monarchs in 1790, 1802, and 1805. Finally, in 1807, Fiume became legally a part of Hungary. The Fiuman governor had a right to vote in the Chamber of Magnates of the Royal Hungarian Diet (Orszaggyules), while “the deputies of Fiume” (probably two, since their number was still not specified by the law) had the right to vote as members of the Stände und Orden. Fiume become part of the Hungarian Orszag, but de facto the law was never applied.
Judicial system – Fiume (1790s).
The Gubernium of Fiume is now under the direct Hungarian administration in terms of commercial and economic policies, but still the comitatus of Zagreb retains competencies in judiciary and public education matters. But these capacities were insignificant since in Fiume higher education, initially set by the Jesuits in the 17th century, was replaced by Hungarians after the suppression of the order. On the other hand, in Fiume the judiciary competencies were retained by the local patricians, and de facto, the comitatus of Zagreb and the Croatian estates in Fiume were powerless, since the Gubernium acted as a Court of Appeal (Capitanale Consiglio e Sede Criminale) both for the commercial and civil courts in Fiume.
Illyrian Provinces (1809–1813).
The stability that should have followed the law from 1807 wasn’t about to last long: the decade after the French revolution witnessed a series of wars with which the Habsburgs will always be involved. After two brief occupations in 1797 and 1805, a French government was introduced in 1809, with Fiume included in the “Illyrian provinces” with the seat in Ljubljana. The City constitutes a special “District of Fiume” within Civil Croatia with 3 districts Karlovac, Fiume, Senj with the seat in Karlovac.
The French were to make of the Illyrian provinces a bridge to the oriental traffic so there was a considerable rise of the land-based traffic with the Levant. The British Navy imposed a blockade of the Adriatic Sea, effective since the Treaty of Tilsit (July 1807), which brought merchant shipping to a standstill, a measure most seriously affecting the economy of the Dalmatian port cities. The English with their base on the island of Lissa, soon become masters of the Adriatic. An attempt by joint French and Italian forces to seize the British-held Dalmatian island of Vis failed on October 22, 1810. Napoleon's exclusively land-based customs enforcers could not stop British smugglers, especially as these operated with the connivance of Napoleon's chosen rulers of Spain, Westphalia and other German states, who faced severe shortages of goods from the French colonies. The embargo encouraged British merchants to aggressively seek out new markets and to engage in smuggling with continental Europe. In Fiume Andrea Lodovico de Adamich emerged to become the wealthiest and most powerful merchant in Fiume.
In August 1813, Austria declared war on France. Austrian troops led by General Franz Tomassich invaded the Illyrian provinces. Croat troops enrolled in the French army switched sides. The English General Nugent, serving the Austrian Empire, liberated the town from the reign of the “Illyrian passing glory” on 26 August 1813.
Restoration (1814–1848).
Vienna was reluctant to reincorporate "Transsavan Croatia" (or "Illyrian Croatia") probably because of Metternich's policy towards the region. In the Restoration 1814-1822 Fiume was put under the ephemeral “Kingdom of Illyria”. By the end of the Austrian reign (1823), including the first Hungarian period too (1776–1809), Fiume hardly developed; only minor constructions were done. The number of the inhabitants shows slow increase: in 1777 the number of population was 5312, in 1819 it was 8345.
Francis I, with the order of 1 June 1822, gave back Fiume to Hungary to form the centre of the Hungarial Littoral (Littorale Hungaricum) with the by-ports of Buccari, Portoré and Novi. The new Hungarian governor, Antal Majláth (son of József Majláth, the first Hungarian governor in Fiume) took over the duty on 15 October 1822. Emperor Francis, with a rescript in 1822, made autonomous the Kreise of Carlstadt and Fiume, and thereby, in November 1822, restored the Comitatus of Severin.
Fiume was invited to participate also to the Croatian Diet in Zagreb, where Antun Mihanović then employed as a gubernial secretary was sent. In 1825 – 26 Antun Mihanović (1796-1861) and Andrea Lodovico Adamich (1766–1828) participated at the workings of the Hungarian Diet in Presburg. Adamich there tried to promote a project for a Hungarian commercial company centred in Fiume circulating a memo (eszrevetelek) with scarce success. Afterwards he served as mercantile deputy of Fiume from 1827 until his death in 1828.
Fiuman deputies participated also in the role of observes to the Croatian diets of 1830 and 1832. Far more important was the Hungarian diets from 1832 to 1836 that started the period of liberal reforms in Hungary. With the article XIX of the Hungarian law of 1836 the Fiuman judiciary was firmly included into the Hungarian judicial system and the local civic magistrate lost his judicial capacities transferred to a local court, the "Giudizio Civico Distrettuale della fedelissima Città, Porto franco e Distretto di Fiume".
After the governorship of Ferencz Ürményi (1780 - 1858, governor from 1823 to 1837) Pál Kiss de Nemskér became new governor while Count Ferenc Zichy (1811–1900) acted as deputy governor and was to become Hungarian secretary of state for commerce in the Széchenyi ministry of 1848. After the death of Adamich, Cimiotti become deputy of Fiume at the royal Hungarian Diet serving in 1836 first as observer, and then taking active part in 1843/4. One of his first task as a deputy, together with Mihály Horhy was to draft a plan for political modernization of Fiume, preserving its autonomy within the Hungarian political system. After the inclusion of the city in the Hungarian system Cimiotti exploited the request (Torvenyjavaslat a Hajdúkerületrol 1843/4) advanced by the Hajdú County (Hajdúság) who constituted a "warrior estate" within Hungarian feudal society and were emancipated by István Bocskay, Lord of Bihar, in 1604-1606 from the jurisdiction of their lords. As the Hajdú, Jász and Cuman districts were freed of feudal obligations providing military service so Fiume had to be exempted by providing maritime service for the Kingdom of Hungary. Cimiotti took also the privileges granted to the Gölnicbánya (German: Göllnitz) miners who, as Bavarian settlers invited by the king of Hungary were granted special privileges.
Industrial revolution was well under way: already in 1827 the Smith & Meynier paper mill was founded. In order to get support for the modernization of the port, the "Mercantile deputation" of Fiume sent Ferenc Császár to lobby at the Pest Exchange court in 1842. In 1843 Josef Bainville a French engineer from Fiume who reproposed an older French plan, commissioned by Adamich during the Illyrian provinces. Bainville settled in Hungary and designed a plan for the city of Szeged.
Still in 1842 ambitious plans for advancing trade with Hungary, Wallachia and the Banat were advanced and Cimiotti managed to involve the engineer Mario A. Sanfermo who elaborated a plan to connect Fiume with the Sissek – Carlstadt railroad and its extension to Vukovar and thereby reach Serbia and Wallachia. The railroad Fiume – Vukovar, intended for Russian containment in the context of the Eastern Question, was enthusiastically supported by Kossuth and the founding of a company "Vukovar – Fiumana Unitae Societatis Pestano Fluminensis ad construendam semitam ferratam" was voted by the Hungarian diet in 1848. In this way the well-known debates of Kossuth and István Széchenyi (who visited Fiume in 1844 and decided to allocate 260,000 guldens for port modernization) about how to build up the railway leading from Central Hungary to Fiume, appeared in Fiume in 1846. In the same year one of the articles of Kossuth, titled "To the Sea Hungarians! Go to the Sea!" was published in a periodical of the Trade Association.
In 1846 Vincenzo de Domini (1816 - 1903) become professor at the local nautical school. A Venetian patriot, close to the circles of Kossuth, he will be entrusted together with Gaspare Matcovich and Spiridione Gopcevich (1815 - 1861) with the project to turn the brick "Implacable" into a Hungarian man of war. The armament of the ship, commanded by de Domini, led Jelačić to send an expedition and occupy Fiume on 31 August 1848 with Croat troops.
Hungarian port 1870-1918.
In 1870, following the Compromise of 1867 which created Austria–Hungary, Rijeka was attached to Hungary for the third and last time . Although Croatia had constitutional autonomy within Hungary, the City was independent, governed (as a "corpus separatum") directly from Budapest by an appointed governor, as Hungary's only international port. There was competition between Austria's Port of Trieste and Hungary's Port of Fiume.
Fiume also had a significant naval base, and in the mid-19th century it became the site of the Austro-Hungarian Naval Academy (K.u.K. Marine-Akademie), where the Austro-Hungarian Navy trained its officers.
Giovanni de Ciotta (Mayor from 1872 to 1896) proved to be the most authoritative local political leader. Under his leadership, an impressive phase of expansion of the city started, marked by major port development, fueled by the general expansion of international trade and the city's connection (1873) to the Hungarian and Austrian railway networks. Hungarian support proved to be crucial to the development of the port of Fiume and Ciotta was the key person in assuring it. From 1872 to 1896 (apart from a short interruption in 1884) he was the mayor of the city. Following the financial crisis of 1873, that culminated in 1875, the conservative liberal Deák Party had to face a crisis from which it survived only with a merger with the more numerous conservative Left Center of Kálmán Tisza. The “new” Liberal Party of Hungary, was to rule Hungary (and Fiume) from 1875 to 1890, marking the golden years of Ciotta, later known as the "Idyll".
Under his lead an impressive phase of expansion of the city started, marked by the completion of the railway Fiume – Budapest, the construction of the modern port and the initiation of modern industrial and commercial enterprises such as the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company "Adria", and the Whitehead Torpedo Works. In 1866, Robert Whitehead, manager of Stabilimento Tecnico Fiumano (an Austrian engineering company engaged in providing engines for the Austro-Hungarian Navy), experimented on the first torpedo. Ciotta's contribution was crucial as he financed Robert Whitehead's efforts in producing a viable torpedo. Modern industrial and commercial enterprises such as the Papermill, situated in the Rječina canyon, producing worldwide known cigarette paper, became trademarks of the city.
The population grew from only 21,000 in 1880 to 50,000 in 1910. A lot of major civic buildings went up at that time, including the Governor's Palace designed by the Hungarian architect Alajos Hauszmann. In 1885 the sumptuous new theatre was finished modelled on that of Budapest and Vienna, costing him a political crisis in 1884 for the raising building costs. While on army service he met John Leard, another fiuman of English origins. Ciotta with Leard in 1889 pushed forward the "Piano regolatore" the comprehensive urbanisation plan for the city. The new plan laid down the plan for a modern commercial city, destroying most of the older buildings and roads and introducing the regular planning as it was done in Budapest and other cites of the time. In 1891 the "Acquedotto Ciotta" was finished providing the city with modern sewage and water supply system. He was also a founder of several philanthropic initiatives and institutions.
The “system Ciotta” underwent crisis in 1896 when Hungarian Prime Minister Dezső Bánffy started a centralizing policy towards Fiume. Ciotta, being unable to assure the equilibrium between Fiume and Hungary, resigned and retired to private life, following the Governor Lajos gróf Batthyány de Nemetujvár. As a response Michele Maylender, backed by Luigi Ossoinack (initiator of the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company "Adria"), founded a new party, the Autonomist Association, ending the rule of the Liberal Party of Hungary in Fiume.
The future mayor of New York City, Fiorello La Guardia, lived in the city at the turn of the 20th century, and reportedly even played football for the local sports club.
The Italo-Yugoslav dispute and the Free State.
Habsburg-ruled Austria-Hungary's disintegration in the closing weeks of World War I in the fall of 1918 led to the establishment of rival Croatian and Italian administrations in the city; both Italy and the founders of the new Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) claimed sovereignty based on their "irredentist" ("unredeemed") ethnic populations.
An international force of Italian, French, Serbian, British and American troops occupied the city (November 1918) while its future was discussed at the Paris Peace Conference during the course of 1919.
Italy based its claim on the fact that Italians were the largest single nationality within the city, 88% of total. Croats made up most of the remainder and were also a majority in the surrounding area, including the neighbouring town of Sušak. Andrea Ossoinack, who had been the last delegate from Fiume to the Hungarian Parliament, was admitted to the conference as a representative of Fiume, and essentially supported the Italian claims.
On 10 September 1919, the Treaty of Saint-Germain was signed declaring the Austro-Hungarian monarchy dissolved. Negotiations over the future of the city were interrupted two days later when a force of Italian nationalist irregulars led by the poet Gabriele d'Annunzio seized control of the city by force; d'Annunzio eventually established a state, the Italian Regency of Carnaro.
The resumption of Italy's premiership by the liberal Giovanni Giolitti in June 1920 signalled a hardening of official attitudes to d'Annunzio's "coup". On 12 November, Italy and Yugoslavia concluded the Treaty of Rapallo, under which Rijeka was to be an independent state, the Free State of Fiume, under a regime acceptable to both. D'Annunzio's response was characteristically flamboyant and of doubtful judgment: his declaration of war against Italy invited the bombardment by Italian royal forces which led to his surrender of the city at the end of the year, after a five days resistance. Italian troops took over in January 1921. The election of an autonomist-led constituent assembly for the territory did not put an end to strife: a brief Italian nationalist seizure of power was ended by the intervention of an Italian royal commissioner, and a short-lived local Fascist takeover in March 1922 ended in a third Italian military occupation. Seven months later Italy herself fell under Fascist rule.
Fiume under Fascist rule.
A period of diplomatic acrimony closed with the Treaty of Rome (27 January 1924), which assigned Fiume to Italy and Sušak to Yugoslavia, with joint port administration. Formal Italian annexation (16 March 1924) inaugurated twenty years of Italian government, followed by twenty months of German military occupation in World War II. In 1938 Temistocle Testa prefect from Udine become prefect of the Carnaro province.
Rijeka in World War II.
After the surrender of Italy to the Allies in September 1943, Rijeka and the surrounding territories were occupied by Germany, becoming part of the Adriatic Littoral Zone. Because of its industries (oil refinery, torpedo factory, shipyards) and its port facilities, the city was a target of frequent Anglo-American air attacks. Some of the worst attacks happened on January 12, 1944 (attack on the refinery, part of the Oil Campaign) on November 3–6, 1944, when a series of attacks resulted in at least 125 deaths and between February 15 and 25, 1945 (200 dead, 300 wounded). The harbour area was destroyed by retreating German troops at the very end of the war. Yugoslav troops entered the city on May 3, 1945, after heavy fighting.
Post World War II expulsion of Italians.
The aftermath of the war saw the city's fate again resolved by a combination of force and diplomacy. This time, Yugoslav troops advanced (early May 1945) as far west as Trieste in their campaign against the German occupiers of both countries. The city of Rijeka thus became Croatian (i.e., Yugoslav), a situation formalized by the Paris peace treaty between Italy and the wartime Allies on 10 February 1947. Once the change in sovereignty was formalized, 58,000 of the 66,000 Italian-speakers left in advance of the Yugoslav army, choosing exile (known in Italian as "esuli" or the exiled ones). The discrimination and persecution many of them experienced at the hands of the Yugoslav populace and officials in the last days of World War II and the first weeks of peace remain painful memories. Summary executions of alleged fascists, Italian public servants, military officials and even normal civilians, forced most ethnic Italians to abandon Rijeka in order to avoid this class end ethnic cleansing.
In Yugoslavia.
Because of its importance for the country's shipbuilding industry was from 1947 under the responsibility of the Ministry of National Defence until 1954. In 1948 the main shipyard, renamed Maj 3, which was to serve as a base for the restored shipbuilding industry. In 1949, it launched the first post-war Yugoslav ship, the MB Zagreb of 4000 DWT. Along with the shipbuilding industry would develop one for marine equipment. After being rebuilt, the Torpedo Factory started to produce diesel engines. The former foundry Skull now Svjetlost was devoted to the production of electrical navigation equipment, while the Rikard Benčić manufactured watercraft and other auxiliary equipment. The oil refinery was back in 1948 pre-war production with 110,000 tonnes in the early Fifties it was able to process 200,000 tonnes of oil. At the time, it was supplying 37.6% of the country.
During the period 1960-1990 Rijeka is a city that aspires to the greatest achievements and equips a heavy industry while dreaming of an Utopian tomorrow.
After Edo Jardas, the following mayors followed: Franjo Širola (1959–1964), Nikola Pavletić (1964–1968), and Dragutin Haramija (1968–1969), Neda Andrić (1969–1974), Nikola Pavletić for the second time (1974–1979), Vilim Mulc (1979–1982), Josip Štefan (1982–1984), Zdravko Saršon (1985–1987) and Željko Lužavec (1988–1993). The majority of mayors came from small towns in the immediate surroundings of the city.
Regarding the economic situation, it should be noted that the traffic of the port complex had increased from 420,000 tons in 1946 to more than 20,000,000 tons in 1980. The port was involved in more than 50% of traffic across the country and about 80% in terms of transit. In 1980, Rijeka handled 20% of exports from Croatia and 10% of those of Yugoslavia. In 1980, when the merchant navy was at its peak, Rijeka shipping had a cargo capacity of 500,000 tons. Jugolinija was the largest shipping company of the state while Jadrolinija dealt with 49 ships and passenger transportation service by ferry-boats. Approximately 23,000 people were employed in industry in that year. Over 80% of the total industrial production was produced by the energy sector (electric power industry, oil processing and coal), as well as shipbuilding. This feature coupled with the low number of finished products explains why industry of Rijeka collapsed in the early Nineties. In 1982 there were 92,489 employees from a population of 193,000. The oil refinery treated 8,000,000 tonnes - 28% of the total state turnover. The plant had been based in Urinj since 1966. In the Eighties the construction of a petrochemical complex in Omišalj began, which later made one of the biggest losses for the state. The 3rd of May shipyard handled about one third of the shipbuilding industry. The peak in production was achieved between 1971 and 1975, when 32 ships were built, totalling more than 1,200,000 gross tons. These vessels were mainly for export. In the Eighties smaller boats were built and production increased to employ 7,000 shipyard workers and become the largest company in Rijeka. At the same time the shipyard Viktor Lenac in Martinščica developed to become the largest repairs yard in the Mediterranean.
The development of the metalworking industry was linked to the needs of shipbuilding. Thus Vulkan manufactured cranes for the Rikard Benčić ship pumps, Tornado manufactured diesel engines and tractors, electric generators for Rade Končar while Metalografički Kombinat was directed towards the production of metal packaging for the purposes of refinery. Civil engineering was expanding to the point that cooperatives such as Primorje, Jadran, Kvarner and Konstruktor employed some 10,000 workers overall in 1981. More than 6,000 of them were engaged in commerce with Brodokomerc. This was reflected in the construction of many new residential buildings in the city such as the five buildings in Škurinje, all 26 floors in height.

The release of their third album, El Desierto Y La Ciudad, was a sonic departure for the band that earned them praise from the likes of NPR, The Wall Street Journal, and The Village Voice. The album was featured on NPR's First Listen for which Felix Contreras wrote, “…inventive sense of arrangement, combined with great songwriting, elevates El Desierto y la Ciudad above and beyond its traditional source material. The result is a major step forward for a songwriter and a band that deserves wider recognition. With this album, Pistolera just might get it.”
In 2011 the band was invited to perform a Tiny Desk Concert at the NPR office in Washington, D.C. 
Their song, "Nuevos Ojos", was featured in Season 4, Episode 12 of the hit AMC TV show Breaking Bad.

Illinois Staats-Zeitung

Illinois Staats-Zeitung ("Illinois State Newspaper") was a German-language newspaper published in Chicago, Illinois. The newspaper was founded in April 1848 as a weekly, and became a daily in 1851. The newspaper had as its main ambition to maintain the use of the German language. Along with the "Westliche Post" and "Anzeiger des Westens", both of St. Louis, it was one of the three most successful German-language newspapers in the United States Midwest.
Politically, the newspaper was Republican. Hermann Kriege was an early editor. In the 1850s, the paper was taken over by Forty-Eighters and became a major daily newspaper of the Chicago German-born community. In 1851, Georg Schneider joined the staff of the paper and became editor. Among his associates were George Hillgärtner and Daniel Hertel. Schneider played a major role in building the Republican Party in Illinois, a work in which the "Illinois Staats-Zeitung" played an important function. "Illinois Staats-Zeitung" opposed slavery, and Schneider successfully used the newspaper as a platform to campaign against the Kansas-Nebraska Act. On February 22, 1856 Schneider attended, on behalf of the "Illinois Staats-Zeitung", a meeting in Decatur of anti-Nebraska newspapers in Illinois. In total 26 newspapers were represented at the meeting, assembled by the "Morgan Journal" editor Paul Selby.
During the Civil War years, Lorenz Brentano was proprietor and editor-in-chief, succeeding Schneider. In these years, the paper fully dominated German-language press in the city, as Democratic German-language newspapers were short-lived at the time. At this point, "Illinois Staats-Zeitung" was the second-largest daily newspaper in the Chicago. During the war, Wilhelm Rapp was on the staff. He came from the "Baltimore Wecker" after a riot destroyed its office. After the war, he returned to the "Wecker".
1867, Hermann Raster accepted the position of editor and remained until his death in 1891. Raster was the longest holder of this position. Wilhelm Rapp returned to the "Staats-Zeitung" in 1872, and became editor when Raster died.
Other notable members of the staff of the "Staatszeitung" were Adolph Wiesner and Caspar Butz.
Between 1891 and 1899, the paper had a separate evening edition, "Abendblatt" ("Evening Paper").
In 1921, the paper was sold for 25,000 dollars. The paper was resurrected as "Deutsch-Amerikanische Bürger-Zeitung". A short time before, the "Chicagoer Freie Presse" had merged with the paper.

William John Adie

William John Adie MD Ed., FRCP (1886–1935) was a British physician and neurologist known for describing the Adie syndrome and narcolepsy.
Biography.
William Adie was born in Geelong, Australia, on 31 October 1886. He was educated at Flinder's School, but had to leave school to support his family at the age of 13 when his father died in 1899. He worked as an office errand boy, and an employer noticed his ability to learn. He funded evening classes for Adie, who was able to pass the university entrance examination. A doctor in Geelong, Dr. Arthur South, inspired him to study medicine.
An uncle in Boston, Massachusetts paid £19 for a one-way ticket for Adie to travel to England to study medicine, which he did at the University of Edinburgh with the help of his uncle and a scholarship. He qualified M.B. Ch.B. in 1911. He became interested in neurology, and worked in Berlin, Vienna, Munich and Paris for a year on a travelling scholarship.
He fought in the First World War in France, firstly as medical officer to the Northamptonshire Regiment, and was one of few survivors from the regiment after the retreat from Mons due to a bout of measles which kept him from the battle. He was then posted to the Leicestershire Regiment, and was mentioned in despatches for saving a number of soldiers from a gas attack in 1916 by improvising a gas mask made of clothing soaked in urine. While on leave in 1916 he married Lorraine Bonar; they had two children. He subsequently served as neurological specialist to the 7th General Hospital, where he advised on management of head injured patients.
After the war he worked as a medical registrar at Charing Cross Hospital before working at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Queens Square, and the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, practising general medicine with neurology as his speciality. He became a Member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1919. In 1926 he was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians, and also received the gold medal for his M.D. at Edinburgh.
In 1932 Adie was one of the founders of the Association of British Neurologists, which was formed at a meeting on 28 July at the house of Gordon Holmes.
Adie was known as an excellent teacher of medicine and a fine diagnostician with extraordinary powers of observation. His interests also included ornithology, tennis and skiing. At the age of 45 he developed angina, forcing him to retire in 1935. He died on 17 March 1935 from a myocardial infarction at the age of 48.
Publications.
Adie and his colleague James Collier wrote the neurology chapter in Price's "Textbook of the Practice of Medicine" which is considered to be the first account of neurology in a general textbook.
Adie also published articles on pupillary abnormalities, "forced grasping and groping" in frontal lobe disorders, and narcolepsy.

In 2003, Paralympian Peter Gottwald Jr. graduated from California High School, where he holds the school record in the 5K (15:08) and is second-fastest in the mile. Retired U.S. Paralympian Vince Martin and his cross country coach, Steve Armstrong, introduced Gottwald Jr. to the Paralympics. Vince Touey, a coach from Widener University, along with his father, Schuyler Gottwald Sr., helped him out tremendously. Without those two, his schooling at West Chester University and training for his first Paralympic Team would not have been possible. His father drove him everywhere for college, training and races, and Coach Touey took time to write his workouts.
At the 2008 Paralympic Games, Gottwald Jr. proved that all the hours of training and hard work eventually pay off. He rewarded everyone who contributed to his Paralympic dream by winning a silver medal in the 800m T13.
Gottwald graduated from West Chester University in Pennsylvania with a teaching degree in the field of health and physical education and will continue on to get his M. Ed.: School Health at the same college.
After running in Beijing, China Peter Gottwald Jr. is now focusing on his studies at West Chester University, but still running and keeping in shape. Although Peter is taking time off from his running career he is running many time trials at a very fast pace showing that he can still come back and be strong if need be. Peter's 1:49.41 800 meter time trial on a 166 meter indoor track and his 7:52.08 3,000 meter road time trial in 2009 proves that he is a strong athlete who can go the distance.
Peter would always say: "A dream can become your reality if you have the willingness to get up and go forward"
"Remember that one person can only fill the glass, which is an example of life, and one day it will be filled to the top and knowing that you filled it yourself will give you that reality of true accomplishment." - Peter S. Gottwald Jr.

Leaf gap

A leaf gap is a space in the stem of a plant through which the leaf grows. The leaf is connected to the stem by the leaf trace, which grows through the leaf gap. 
The leaf gap is a break in the vascular tissue of a stem above the point of attachment of a leaf trace. It exists in the nodal region of the stem as a "gap in the continuity of the primary vascular cylinder above the level where a leaf trace diverges toward a leaf. This gap is filled with parenchyma tissue".

Bullhead Group

Bullhead Group is a stratigraphic unit of Lower Cretaceous age in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin of northeastern British Columbia and western Alberta. It was first defined by F.H. McLearn in 1918 as the Bullhead Mountain Formation, but later was upgraded to group status. It consists of the Cadomin and Gething Formations, although some early workers included the Bluesky Formation and others in the group.
Lithology.
Bullhead Group includes the conglomerate and quartzose sandstones of the Cadomin Formation at the base, and grades to sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, shale and coal seams of the overlying Gething Formation. Those sediments were deposited in alluvial fan, braided river, deltaic and coastal plain environments.
Distribution.
The Bullhead Group is present in the foothills of the Northern Rocky Mountains and the adjacent plains, extending from the Tuchodi River of British Columbia in the north to the Smoky River of Alberta in the south. It thins eastward from about in the western foothills of northeastern British Columbia to about in the Peace River plains, reaching zero near Fort St. John. The most complete section is found in the type locality of the Gething Formation in the Peace River Canyon immediately downstream from the W. A. C. Bennett Dam.
Relationship to other units.
The Bullhead Group overlies a major regional unconformity caused by pre-Bullhead erosion. It rests unconformably on the Fernie Formation, the Nikanassin Formation, the Minnes Group or the Kootenay Group, depending on the location and the extent of the erosion. It is overlain conformably by the glauconitic sandstones and marine shales at the base of the Fort St. John Group.

Kid Icarus (band)

Kid Icarus is an American indie rock group based in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, born of a solo recording project by Eric Schlittler. The band has released five full-length albums: "Maps of the Saints", "Be My Echo", "The Metal West", "Imaginary Songs & Aluminum Hits" and "American Ghosts".
History.
After leaving the band Suetta, Eric Schlittler began producing cassette recordings using inexpensive home equipment. 
Calling his project Kid Icarus after the 1987 Nintendo Entertainment System video game of the same name,
Schlittler recorded "Maps of the Saints" in 1998 and 1999. The album contained lo-fi songs in the style of Guided by Voices, as well as psychedelic tracks influenced by Roky Erickson, Scott Walker, and Syd Barrett. 
Schlittler's next album, 2002's "Be My Echo", included a mix of lo-fi rock and acoustic singer-songwriter music. 
A remastered reissue of "Maps of the Saints" followed in 2003. While Schlittler continued to write and record in his home studio, Kid Icarus grew as a project to incorporate his friends and other musicians in northeastern Pennsylvania. 
"The Metal West", Kid Icarus's third album, was released in 2005, and marked Schlittler's first attempt at a hi-fi recording. The album featured contributions from guitarist Justin Marchegiani, bassist Ted Baird, drummer Thad Moyer, and keyboardist Chuck Keller. 
"Spin" magazine writer Lane Brown compared Schlittler's vocals to Elliott Smith, and called the band "Pavement on psychedelics." 
Mike Schiller of PopMatters described the album's lead track, "Beekeepers on the Edge of Town", as the "most obvious choice for a possible hit." Schiller added that the song sounded somewhat like The Hives, "if Howlin’ Pelle [Almqvist was Dronin’ Pelle." Kid Icarus released a split 7" single with the band Das Black Milk in 2009.

Kurulu Bedda

Kurulu Bedda is a 1961 Sri Lankan drama written by P. K. D Seneviratne. It attempted to follow in the precedent set by "Rekava" and create a truly Sinhala film.
Plot.
The story takes place in a small Sri Lankan village Kurulu Bedda. The Bandara family are members of the wealthy elite. Bandara Mahatthaya is the young heir of the family name and Bandara Menike is his mother. Siyadoris is a village man who works for the Bandara family. He has a pretty daughter named Ranmenike. Another member of the village is Kaithan Baas, a crafty marriage broker who advises Bandara Menike.
Bandara Mahatthaya has given up his medical education to take up his family properties when his father dies. He becomes attracted to Ranmenike after spotting her taking a bath while walking with a friend from medical school. He takes a photo of her and is seen by Kaithan Baas, who scolds this behavior to his mother.
Kaithan is brought before the rural court soon after on a fowl theft charge. Siyadoris testifies against him but Kaithan uses his cunning ways to escape conviction. From that day on he swears to get his revenge against Siyadoris' family.
The medical student friend of Bandara Mahatthaya finishes his education and comes to the village as a doctor. On his arrival, he oversees Health Week celebration which includes a beauty contest. Ranmenike enters and wins much to the ire of Kaithan.
During a thovil ceremony, Kaithan sets fire to Siyadoris' house and is finally imprisoned. The doctor and Bandara Mahatthaya help out Siyadoris with money to build a new house. The doctor is transferred to a different district soon after. At that time, Bandara Menike forces Siyadoris into conducting his daughter's marriage to a man from a distant village. Bandara Mahatthaya is saddened but doesn't do anything to interfere. He presents Ranmenike with a gift on the wedding day which brings tears to her eyes. She then leaves for her husband's village.
Time passes and Bandara Mahatthaya remains a bachelor extending all his strength into helping the city. Ranmenike becomes ill after her husband is killed in an accident and is admitted to the doctor friend's hospital which as fate has it is in her husband's district. Bandara Mahatthaya comes to the hospital and shares his feelings. They exchange words, Ranmenike entrusts him with his wedding gift to be given to her daughter and she dies during the birth. Bandara Mahatthaya leaves with the child. The village then weeps for Ranmenike's goodness.
Production.
Development.
Arthur Amaratunga who hailed from a small village was inspired to make a truly Sinhala film, after watching "Rekava", that avoided the crudities common in popular film of the time. He subsequently came across a collection of stories by P. K. D. Seneviratne broadcast over the radio as "Kurulu Bedda" which were fitting to his goal. He contacted Seneviratne and got him to write a film script based on the work.
Amaratunga operated under limited resources. He could only afford call sheets from the rundown Sundara Sound Studios and a South Indian crew that had no experience with location shooting. Poor photography, poor editing and poor processing resulted.
Reception.
The film received rave reviews upon release and was a box office hit. A lot of praise was directed at the authenticity of the film in dealing with village characters. A critic for a Sinhala daily wrote: "The makers of Kurulubedde have not learned the Background of the Ceylon villager from books or hearsay. They have actually lived it."

Partnership House

Partnership House is a landmark tower office building in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. It is located within the Regent Centre business park, and was originally built to act as the main entrance and landmark building within the headquarters complex of the Northern Rock bank, prior to its near-collapse and nationalisation. It lies in the West Gosforth council ward. The building is owned by the local council, Newcastle City Council, whereas the majority of the "Regent Centre" buildings are owned by the Fordgate Group. The council bought the building, initially known as "The Tower", for £22 million, and currently leased to green support services company, Carillion Energy.
History.
The 1960s Northern Rock Tower.
In the 1960s, a 10 storey tower building was constructed for the newly formed Northern Rock Building Society in Gosforth. This became the focal point of the Fordgate Group's Regent Centre complex in Newcastle upon Tyne. The Northern Rock Building Society was formed in 1965 as a result of the merger of Northern Counties Permanent Building Society (established in 1850) and Rock Building Society (established in 1865). Although not technically a part of Regent Centre, the Northern Rock buildings are adjacent to the complex.
During the 1990s, the expanding building society built two new buildings at its "Northern Rock House" site in Gosforth; the Kielder and Prudhoe buildings. By the late 1990s, along with many other building societies, the Northern Rock Building Society decided to demutualise, and become a bank. After becoming a bank Northern Rock began to grow quickly. This growth in business created the need for more buildings at its headquarters in Gosforth, so two sandstone and glass buildings were erected in the early 2000s.
Northern Rock also had customer contact centre operations at both Doxford International Business Park in Sunderland and at its head office. The bank was also developing a site at Rainton Bridge, which was sold to npower.
The 2000s tower.
In 2004 the bank unveiled its plans for a new building to replace the ageing 1960s tower. The planning application was submitted to Newcastle City Council by Red Box Design Group on 13 September 2004, and the decision to grant the application was made on 17 January 2006. The branch of the bank located in the original tower building was closed on 16 July 2005, to allow for the demolition.
In early 2006 the 1960s tower building was demolished by Thompsons of Prudhoe, and building work began on its replacement building in June 2006. Building the new tower was the final phase of the redevelopment of the Gosforth site. The design for this new tower was similar to the sandstone and glass buildings built in the early 2000s. The Red Box Design Group has been involved with the development of all of the currently standing buildings for the bank.
The new 10-storey building cost £35 million. Taylor Woodrow was the main contractor, and companies such as Desco and Red Box Architecture were involved with the design and construction. The building has been designed to achieve an "Excellent" BREEAM rating. The tower has a semi circular floor plate containing flexible open plan space and external roof top hospitality facilities.
After the bank's nationalisation.
In September 2007 Northern Rock received emergency liquidity support from the Bank of England, due to problems stemming from the subprime mortgage crisis. After the press reported the news, a bank run commenced, where scared customers began to pull their money out of the bank. Private bids for the bank failed, and eventually in February 2008, the bank was nationalised. At the time of its nationalisation, the bank was mid-way through construction of the 10-storey tower which was intended to create 1500 jobs, and act as the main entrance and focal point of the company headquarters.
The nationalisation led to the company deciding to downsize, including job cubs and deciding to put this new tower building up for let or sale, as the additional space had become surplus to requirements. The company's other site at Rainton Bridge was also to be sold or let to a third party.
The new tower block, simply known as "The Tower", was completed in November 2008. "The Tower" which had a Restaurant area on the ground floor and coffee shop facilities on first floor, had a total lettable area of 120,023sq ft. Gavin Black & Partners and GVA Lamb & Edge were appointed as the joint sole agents for the property. At November 2009 the lease for the building stood at £2.25 million a year.
Sale to the council and lease to Eaga/Carillion.
Newcastle City Council proposed to spend £22 million purchasing the building, and will let it out to another firm, a company set up by the council with support services firm Eaga, on a 25 year lease. A maturity loan over 40 years from the Public Works Loan Board with a predicted interest rate of less than 4.5% will be taken out by the council. The council expect to make money from leasing the building, in excess of the amount that they paid for it. One floor of the building was sub-let back to the council by Eaga (as of 2013 the council has been removed from the building signage).
However in May 2009, the plans of the Liberal Democrat Council to buy the Tower were thrown into doubt. This was due to Northern Rock deciding to defer their decision to sell the building, as well as opposition from the local Labour Party. On 12 May "The Journal" newspaper reported that the Northern Rock board had approved the deal, that the Labour opposition had been quelled. This was after a report refuting Labour's claims was put before two scrutiny panels, and that a motion to send the decision back for further discussions was defeated by seven votes to six, at the Civic Centre.
In October 2009 the council completed their purchase of the Tower, and renamed it as Partnership House. As of January 2010 there was around a thousand workers in the offices at Partnership House for the "Real Partnership" - a partnership between the City Council and Eaga. It was officially opened by Peter Mandelson. Eaga was bought by Carillion soon after moving into the building.
In January 2013 Astrium Services moved into level 9. In March 2013 AMEC moved into levels 6 and 7, relocating staff from nearby Northumbria House. In 2013 the NHS logo was added to the building signage.
Interior dimensions.
The building has the following approximate net lettable floor areas:
