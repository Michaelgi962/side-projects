National Association of Women Artists

The National Association of Women Artists (NAWA) is a United States organisation for women involved in fine art. It was founded in 1889 as the Women's Art Club, at a time when women did not have parity with men in the National Academy of Design and the Society of American Artists. In 1913 it was renamed National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the current name was adopted in 1941.
Its mission statement is: 
The National Association of Women Artists (NAWA), founded in 1889, is the oldest professional women's fine arts organization in the United States, continually providing a forum for women artists to share ideas and exhibit their work. The organization has been promoting and nurturing the work of professional women artists, sponsoring local and national exhibitions, offering merit prizes, lectures and special events for its 850+ membership, and hosting ongoing exhibitions at its headquarters address in NYC. I was invited to the annual meeting and luncheon where Margaret Krug, Senior Lecturer at the Whitney Museum of American Art, spoke about Teaching Materials and the process of writing her recent book, An Artist’s Handbook (reviewed in ART TIMES Jan/Feb ’08 issue). Judith Cantor, outgoing president, spoke about the many activities of the previous year and then introduced the recipients of the Volunteer Awards: Gloria Spevacek. Susan G. Hammond was introduced as the new President and she spoke about the needs of the organization, her hopes for the upcoming year. It was an excellent introduction to her term of office — a “state of what’s to be” speech. After the luncheon we were all invited back to the NAWA office and Gallery for the reception of the members’ group exhibit “Spring into Summer”.
National Association of Women Artists, Inc. 2013 annual meeting and luncheon honored Rhoda Sherbell, fine artist and sculptor and teacher at both the National Academy and The Arts Students League of NY. This organization has been Empowering Women Artists since 1889 and promotes culture and education in the Visual Arts through exhibitions of its member’s works, lectures, art demonstrations, scholarships, awards and other educational programs. They encourage new emerging artists in many ways. The luncheon was very well attended and after the annual meeting and lunch Rhoda gave a very stimulating presentation about her sculpture and paintings. Rhoda teaches at the Art Students League of NY and at the National Academy and has her work in many of the finest museum collections. She told stories, praised N.A.W.A., passed along good advice and wisdom to artists “Be truthful to yourself and your work will be true.” About being a woman artist she said that women should “walk in their own shoes and be strong. It is a tough life for women but we don’t cry about it”. Her work — excellent pastels and several fine bronze heads were on view at the N.A.W.A. gallery.

Peter Evans-Freke, 11th Baron Carbery

Peter Ralfe Harrington Evans-Freke, 11th Baron Carbery (20 March 192028 July 2012) was the 11th Baron Carbery from 1970 until his death at the age of 92 in 2012.
Evans-Freke was educated at Downside, a Benedictine boarding school in Somerset. He then joined the Royal Engineers and during the Second World War saw active service behind enemy lines in Burma, where he took part in raids to destroy Japanese infrastructure. He then served in British India and ended his military service with the rank of Captain.
Following the war, Evans-Freke went into business, becoming a director of an equine and livestock insurance company. He married firstly Joyzelle, an Australian, and they had three sons, Michael, John, and Stephen, and two daughters, Maura and Angela. In a marriage which lasted more than sixty years, the couple were frequent visitors to Lourdes. 
On 25 December 1970 Evans-Freke succeeded an uncle in the family peerage and baronetcy. 
He had a deep interest in agriculture. A Traditionalist Catholic, his deep devotion to the Roman Catholic Church was matched by a love of music and poetry, and he was, as his son John described him in the eulogy, an “incurable romantic”. He became a Military Knight of Malta, joining the most important of the military orders of the Roman Catholic Church. 
Following his wife's death in 2006, Carberry married again, remaining with his second wife, Elisabeth, until his death in July 2012.
Carbery had his last wish fulfilled when he was entombed in the ancient family vault, the crypt of the ruined chapel of Castle Freke, a ruin overlooking the Atlantic in the west of County Cork, following a Tridentine Mass at the church in Rathbarry. Reviving a family tradition, Carberry's remains were carried up the wooded avenue at Freke in a 19th-century horse-drawn hearse, to be entombed next to those of his first wife, who was buried in the same place in 2006. That was the first time the vault at Castle Freke had been opened since 1852. The immediacy of his religious belief was reflected in the simple rosary placed on his coffin for the Mass.
Carberry was outlived by his second wife, Elisabeth, Lady Carbery, and his five children, and was succeeded by his son Michael Evans-Freke, 12th Baron Carbery.

The stately, massive structure with its Doric order piazza and tripartate windows is the only remaining elaborate example of its style in Bridgeport and was once considered among the finest country seats on the North Shore of Long Island Sound." It was built as a home for Edwards Johnson, who was a gentleman farmer and an oyster cultivator, and who was a grandson of William Samuel Johnson. The house was sold by Johnson in 1844 to Don Jose DeRivera, a wine and sugar merchant from Puerto Rico. The house no longer stands; on its site is the Jettie Tisdale School.

National Lobster Hatchery

The National Lobster Hatchery is a charitable organization located in Padstow, England. The hatchery was opened in August 2000 and is situated on South Quay in Padstow, Cornwall. The organisation is a marine Conservation, research and education charity that focuses its efforts on the European lobster. It exists to serve the coastal fishing communities of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. The hatchery consists of a visitor centre, shop and conference facility, as well as various culture spaces, laboratories and technical facilities.
Purpose.
The National Lobster Hatchery is a marine conservation, research and education charity that focuses exclusively on the European Lobster, a commercially exploited species. 
Conservation.
The charity's conservation work focuses on enhancing the stocks of lobsters in the coastal waters of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. Should stocks collapse (as they have done elsewhere) this work would shift its focus to restocking.
The National Lobster Hatchery is in partnership with few selected local fishermen and shellfish wholesalers whom provide female egg-bearing lobsters which are taken in and held until their eggs hatch. The resulting larvae are then on-grown into their post-larval stages before being released into the coastal waters of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. 
Juvenile lobsters are released onto suitable substrate, either by dive clubs who deliver the lobsters to the seabed, or by fisherman who effectively pump the juveniles directly onto the sea floor. 
The released juveniles will take between four and five years to grow to marketable size, several studies have estimated very good wild survival for hatchery reared lobsters and have even estimated the contribution to fisheries of such programs.
Research.
The research work focuses on two key areas: (1) assessing the effectiveness of stocking work and (2) developing techniques for lobster culture. 
The main research priority for the National Lobster Hatchery is to assess the effectiveness of the stock enhancement program. This includes the establishment of a population model for local populations and an assessment of the appropriatness of genetic markers as a tool to measure the programs contribution to catches. The charity is also focusing efforts on in-house research and development work. These are projects specifically designed to improve the implementation stock enhancement techniques. The overarching aims of this work is to create an overall improvement in the production of jueveile lobsters, their fitness and their unit costs of production. This work will include improving husbandry techniques, improving our understanding of the nutritional requirements of the European lobster, gaining a better understanding of the implications of disease and improving juvenile health and behaviour, developing effective release systems and developing artificial habitats for promoting post release survival.
Education.
The organisation's education program focuses on raising awareness of the sustainability issues associated with coastal fisheries, promoting traditional and novel fisheries management tools and highlighting the importance of consumer choice.
The National Lobster Hatchery formally educates people from pre school to postgraduate. As well as contributing to University courses available nearby, the charity offers student placements and engages postgraduate students from various Universities in its research program. 
The National Lobster Hatchery is one of the few marine biology laboratories in the world open to visitors. As well as seeing the progression of a lobster from egg to adult and learning about the hatchery's conservation and research work, children can learn about the wider marine environment, the importance of fisheries to our coastal communities, the impact of those fisheries on the environment and the relevance of fisheries management.
History.
The National Lobster Hatchery was initiated with a query from a Member of the Cornwall Sea Fisheries Committee in 1992. An enormous amount of work was undertaken by the founding Chairman, Mr Edwin Derriman (the Chief fishery Officer for Cornwall) eventually culminating in the purpose built and designed building being erected on the quayside of Padstow, in 2000. The organisation was initially run as a not for profit company and charitable status was awarded in 2004. The organisation is now run as a company limited by guarantee and charity and in 2009 the organisation gained accreditation as a social enterprise. The Directors/Trustees are drawn from relevant disciplines and bodies and are unpaid. 
The hatchery was eventually opened to the public in August 2000 although there were many problems associated with life support systems during the early days as well as a lack of visitors due to a foot and mouth outbreak. Subsequently an upgrade of the life support systems took place in 2005 along with another upgrade to the holding facilities in 2010. The visitor centre has had many facelifts notably in 2005 and 2010. Funds are now being raised for a further upgrade of all the hatchery systems, to increase capacity and to improve the efficiency of the operation.
The National Lobster Hatchery is one of two similar facilities in the UK. The other hatchery is in the Orkney Islands and is financially supported by the Orkney Fishermen’s Association. 
Lobster hatcheries throughout the world are seen as a very positive way of increasing stock levels and, when mainly funded by visitors (the Padstow facility is one of only 2 facilities in the world so far to do this), the concept is then seen as being cost effective.
Further research is required to validate the effectiveness of hatcheries and to improve culture techniques. The National Lobster Hatchery has developed numerous partnerships with various research organisations in order to further develop the research capacity of the charity.
Awards.
The National Lobster Hatchery has received various awards and accolades including a Pride in Seafood award in 2005 for its contribution to the UK seafood industry.

Solanum chacoense

Solanum chacoense is a species of wild potato. It is native to South America, where it can be found in Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Peru, Uruguay, and Paraguay. It "is one of the most widely distributed wild potato species." It grows as a common weed in disturbed habitat such as crop fields. It can also be found in Australia, China, the United States, England, New Zealand, and elsewhere as an introduced species.
This plant has been extensively researched in the quest to find ways to improve its relative, the cultivated potato ("Solanum tuberosum"). It is sexually compatible with the common potato. It was likely introduced to regions outside its usual range when it was imported for study and breeding with the potato. Many of the sites where it has been found are next to plant breeding stations and botanical gardens. This wild species contains leptine glycoalkaloids which make it resistant to the Colorado potato beetle ("Leptinotarsa decemlineata"), a pest of potato crops. It has also shown resistance to verticillium wilt and potato leafroll virus.

Aljon Mariano

Aljon Mariano (born August 3, 1992) is a collegiate basketball player from the Philippines. He is currently playing for the UST Growling Tigers in the UAAP.
UST Growling Tigers.
Rookie season.
Mariano joined the Tigers in 2009. Mariano played limited minutes with the Tigers during his first season with the team.
Second season.
In his second season, Mariano became a starter for the Tigers, while averaging 7.1 points per game and 3.1 rebounds per game. Unfortunately, the inexperienced Tigers failed to return to the Final Four and finished 7th in the standings at 4-10 ahead of the UP Fighting Maroons.
Injury and return.
Mariano sat out the entire season in UAAP Season 74 due to a fractured ankle which kept him out of action for 6 months.
Mariano returned to the Tigers the following season. In a game against the Ateneo Blue Eagles, Mariano scored a career high 21 points and 13 rebounds as he led the Tigers to snap a 12 game losing streak against the Blue Eagles 71-70. In a game against the De La Salle Green Archers, Mariano scored all of his 15 points in the 4th quarter and in the two overtime periods, including the game-winning basket with 7.1 seconds left as the Tigers defeat the Green Archers in double overtime 84-82. Then in their second round meeting against the NU Bulldogs, Mariano set another career high 22 points including the game winner with 4.4 seconds left in overtime as he led the Tigers to an overtime victory against the Bulldogs 58-57. The Tigers were able to advance to the UAAP Final Four as the #2 seed with a 10-4 record in the elimination round, they were able to defeat the NU Bulldogs to advance to the UAAP Finals and faced off against the Ateneo Blue Eagles but were swept in the Finals 2-0 as the Blue Eagles completed their five-peat. Mariano finished the season averaging 13.3 points per game, 7.3 rebounds per game and 2.2 assists per game on 42% shooting from the field, 36% shooting from 3 point range and 67% free throw shooting.
In the Philippine Collegiate Champions League later that year, Mariano would play a key part in the Tigers run in the tournament as they first won the Metro Manila-Luzon tournament by defeating both the Letran Knights and the Adamson Soaring Falcons to enter into the PCCL Final Four with the Ateneo Blue Eagles, San Beda Red Lions and the Southwestern U Cobras. The Tigers would finish with a 2-1 record in the Final Four to set up a rematch with the Blue Eagles in the Finals, where the Tigers exacted their revenge against the Eagles as they were crowned the National Champions after winning the title in a tightly contested three game series.
Fourth season.
In his fourth season with the Tigers, Mariano fought through an ankle injury throughout the season as the Tigers struggled throughout the season after coming off their runner-up finish the previous season and their national championship run. Despite the injury, Mariano would be a key catalyst to the Tigers' run throughout the season as the Tigers made a stunning bid to return UAAP Finals where they battled the De La Salle Green Archers. Mariano however would struggle during the Finals against the Archers. In Game 3 of the Finals, he missed the title-clinching jumper that sent the game into overtime and would turn the ball over in the final moments that led to the title-clinching jumper by Almond Vosotros as the Archers won the title with a Game 3 win over the Tigers 71-69. Mariano ended the season averaging 11.4 points per game, 7.3 rebounds per game and 2.1 assists per game on 40% shooting from the field and 66% shooting from the free throw line.

<doc id="36710681" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36710681" title="Simon of Kalocsa">
Simon of Kalocsa

Simon was a prelate of foreign origin in the Kingdom of Hungary in the first half of the 12th century. He was bishop of Pécs from around 1108 until 1135 at the latest, and archbishop of Kalocsa and Bács between around 1135 and 1142. His command of Greek is well attested in the sources.
Life.
The first record on Simon is connected to the transcription of the deed of foundation of the convent of Greek nuns at Veszprém in 1109. In this year King Coloman of Hungary entrusted Simon to open and read the charter issued in Greek for the nuns most probably in the reign of King Stephen I of Hungary in order to compare the text with the properties the nuns actually possessed in the first decade of the 12th century. Having completed this work, Simon was also appointed to prepare, in collaboration with the bishop of Veszprém, both a copy of the original deed of foundation and its Latin variant reflecting the actual situation. When preparing the Latin version of the charter, Bishop Simon took care of the interests of his own diocese by emphasizing that the village of Magyarsarlós was jointly possessed by the nuns and the bishop of Pécs. Bishop Simon's mastery of Greek and the use of South Italian patterns in the Latin variant of the charter point at his Sicilian or South Italian origin. Accordingly, he may well have arrived in the kingdom in the retinue of King Coloman's first wife, Felicia of Sicily in 1097.
Simon was one of the bishops to confirme the oath taken in 1111 by King Coloman on the preservation of the liberties of the towns of Dalmatia. Similarly, he was one of the four bishops to sign a charter issued for Trogir and Split in 1124 by King Coloman's successor, King Stephen II. The latter is the last existing authentic charter mentioning one "Bishop Simon of Pécs", but referring to ancient manuscripts József Koller would in the 18th century state that Simon was still at the head of the diocese in 1133. Moreover, a falsified charter dated to 1135 lists one Archbishop Simon of Kalocsa. Taking into account that the latter was based on a charter issued in the reign of King Béla II of Hungary, it is plausible that Simon was elevated to the rank of archbishop following decades of his bishopric in Pécs.

During World War II Qantas operated flying boats on the Australia-England route in cooperation with BOAC. After Italy entered the war in June 1940, this became the Horseshoe Route between Sydney and Durban in South Africa with the South Africa - UK stage being by sea. This service was a vital line of communication between Australia and the United Kingdom.
Post War era.
After World War II Qantas modernised its fleet with Lockheed Constellation aircraft, commencing with six L-749 Constellations from 1947.
In 1950, Qantas introduced the first of five Short Sandringham flying boats which flew from the Rose Bay flying boat base on Sydney Harbour to destinations in New Caledonia, New Hebrides, Fiji, New Guinea and Lord Howe Island. Two of these were purchased from TEAL and the other three were purchased from BOAC. These were in service through to 1955.
From 1954, Qantas placed into service the first of sixteen L-1049 Super Constellation aircraft, which would remain in the fleet through to 1963. By 1956 the airline was operating 34 propeller-driven aircraft. Qantas carried a record number of passengers to the XVI Olympic Games in Melbourne, and also carried the Olympic flame into the Southern Hemisphere for the first time on its longest ever trip, from Athens to Darwin.
Jet era.
Qantas entered the Jet Age in July 1959 with Boeing 707 services to the USA. The service was extended to London (via New York). Sydney–London services (via India) began in October 1959. With the certification of the turbofan engine, Qantas modified its existing 707–138 fleet with the turbofans, naming its Boeing 707 aircraft "V-Jets", from the Latin "vannus", meaning “fan” as commonly accepted, but really standing for “thing that blows against the grain”.
Following this, Qantas placed in service twenty-two Boeing 707-338C aircraft, which replaced the Boeing 707-138Bs and provided for expansion of the fleet. These entered service in February 1965 and flew through until retirement in March 1979.
From 1971, Qantas operated the Boeing 747-238B aircraft, which strengthened its long haul fleet. When the Boeing 707s were retired in 1979, Qantas became the world's only all Boeing 747 operator. In 1981, two short body 747SP's entered the fleet for flights to Wellington and they were subsequently used on non-stop flights between Sydney and Los Angeles.
In November 1984, Qantas commenced service with six Boeing 747-338 aircraft with an extended upper deck. From 1985, Qantas ceased being an all Boeing 747 operator when the first of seven Boeing 767-238ERs entered the fleet. These were followed into service by twenty-two Boeing 767-338ERs from September 1988. Seven additional Boeing 767-336ERs were leased and subsequently purchased from British Airways and entering service from August 2000.
Recent retirements.
Qantas operated Airbus A300B4 aircraft after its acquisition of Australian Airlines. The airline also operated Boeing 737-300, Boeing 747-200, Boeing 747SP, Boeing 747-300 and Boeing 767-200ER aircraft.
In 2014 Qantas retired its fleet of Boeing 737-400 aircraft, after the last scheduled service of the type on 23 February.

Anenecuilco

Anenecuilco is a town in the municipality of Ayala, Morelos, Mexico. It has a population of 10,773 people. Mexican revolutionary hero, Emiliano Zapata was born here in 1879, and today the town is the home of a museum in the house of his birth. It is located at , at a mean height of 1,239 metres above sea level. The placenames means "Place where the water twists and turns" in the Nahuatl language.
In the 1850s many of the towns communal lands were usurped by haciendas, as the growing of Sugar Cane extended through Morelos. Particularly the neighboring hacienda "El Hospital", cut off the towns' access to pastures and water sources, and finally expropriated part of the towns communal landholdings. Around the turn of the century Governor of Morelos, Manuel Alarcón, tried to mediate between the townspeople and the "hacendado", but was unsuccessful. The dissatisfaction with the situation led the peasants of Anenecuilco to rise up against the hacienda owners supported by Díaz. Originally an indigenous Nahua community, the town gradually turned mestizo during the second half of the 19th century as the indigenous population crashed due to the unfavorable conditions and mestizos moved in establishing themselves and intermarrying with the locals.

Rim Ju-song (born 31 October 1995) is a North Korean swimmer. He has been selected to be North Korea's sole representative for the country's first ever participation in the Paralympic Games, at the London 2012 Summer Games.
At the time when he was selected, he was living in Beijing. By the time North Korea received clearance to compete in London, it was "too late to qualify for most events, but swimming was an exception". Thus North Korea's representative would have to be a swimmer. Rim, who did not know how to swim, began to learn the crawl stroke in April 2012, reportedly with great difficulty at first, and the breaststroke in May.
Rim is a left arm and left leg amputee, and also suffers disability to his right leg and right foot, following "an accident on a construction site" at the age of five. He was able to make the Games upon receiving a wildcard invitation from the International Paralympic Committee, and with financial support from the British embassy in Pyongyang. He competed in freestyle swimming in the S6 disability category. His time in qualifying prior to the Games (disregarded as he was invited to the Games notwithstanding) was 1:10.00, i.e. 35.3 seconds slower than the slowest actual qualifier.

Sunrise with Sea Monsters

Sunrise with Sea Monsters is an oil painting by English artist J. M. W. Turner. It is in the permanent collection of Tate Britain.
Description.
Near the end of his career Turner created this painting in the coastal town of Margate, in about 1845. It measures . The painting depicts a hazy yellow sunrise over a turbulent grey sea. Lurking in the lower left corner are pink and red swirls usually identified as the eponymous Sea Monsters.
Interpretations.
Beyond these basic elements, though, interpretations of the painting are the source of much study and open to speculation. The Tate Gallery maintains that the "monsters" are just fish. The Tate and other sources posit that a small section of four or five black cross-hatches might be a part of a fishing net. Critic James Hamilton speculates that the mist may hide a steam driven paddleboat being consumed by giant fish or whales, which were the subject of many of Turner's later works. This steamboat theory is consistent with the interpretation of many of Turner's other later works, as a response to the technological changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. Other sources claim that the monsters really are just that: Michael Bockemuhl suggests that the swirls combine to form a single behemoth with large eyes and open mouth that is swimming towards the observer. They may also be compared to the monstrous creatures in the water of Turner's famous "Slavers Throwing overboard the Dead and Dying—Typhoon coming on".
An alternative interpretation is that there is nothing there at all; at least nothing corporeal. Gunnar Schmidt claims the painting has two zones—the warm sunny sky, and the cold dark water—and that at their interface is a mass of drifting steam that has particles and vortices but no shape or limit. In his view, it is this thermal process that is being compared to the "monstrous" power of industrial engines and machinery. Elizabeth Ermarth goes further, comparing this painting with Turner's "Mountain Landscape" and "Seascape with Storm Coming On", and claiming they are "almost entirely abstract representations of space as pure atmosphere, as pure medium of light."
Other shapes may also be interpreted from the painting. The Tate Museum suggests that a larger patch of red and white nearby may be interpreted as a marine float, while a 1907 catalogue from the museum suggests that icebergs can be seen in the distance. Bockemuhl sees a dog's head in a shape in the water on the left of the monster. This varied and fantastic imagery is noted in many of the analyses of Turner's later works. A paper in the "Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine" draws a connection between these figures and Turner's possession of acetate of morphia (a drug related to morphine), possibly used for the treatment of a toothache.

Royal Horse Guards Barracks (Copenhagen)

The Royal Horse Guards Barracks (Danish: Hestegardekassernen), at 26 Frederiksholms Kanal in Copenhagen, Denmark, served as barracks for the Royal Horse Guards from 1792 until 1866. The building is located along the south side of a gated alleyway which connects Frederiksholm Canal to Vester Voldgade. Together with "Civiletatens Materialgård" and "Fæstningens Materialgård", it forms a cluster of low, yellow-washed buildings all of which are listed, on the Zealand side of the canal, opposite the small island Slotsholmen with Christiansborg Palace. The Hay Storage Building at the end of the barracks building, facing Vester Voldgade, originally stored hay for the King's horses at the Royal Stables but later also served the Royal Horse Guards. Both the Royal Horse Guards Barracks and the Hay Storage building are now used by the Ministry of Education.
History.
The Royal Horse Guards Barracks.
Designed by Andreas Kirkerup, the barracks were built in 1792 to house the Royal Horse Guards which had been founded in 1661, on a narrow strip of kand which had until then been part of Civiletatens Materialgård's grounds. The new barracks were conveniently situated, close to Christiansborg Palace on the other side of the canal where the regiment served as royal guards. The building was hit by a fire in 1798 but subsequently rebuilt that same year.
The composer Hans Christian Lumbye had a residence in the building in about 1842.
Later use.
The Royal Horse Guards were disbanded in 1866 and in 1969 the 2nd Artillery Regiment took over the premises which were then known as the Artillery Barracks until 1925 when they relocated to a new installation at Artillerivej on Amager at the other side of the harbour.
The building was then taken over by the Ministry of Education. Many other institutions or individuals rented rooms in the building during the following years.
Architecture.
Royal Horse Guards Barracks.
The building is a long, 2-storey wing which runs from Frederiksholm Canal to the Hay Storage Building on Vester Voldgade and is accessed from a cobbled alleyway with a gate in each end, connecting the two streets. The facade stands in orange-washed masonry divided by lesenes but otherwise has little ornamentation. It is topped by a red tile roof with many dormer windows.
This main wing is to the rear connected to a parallel building part of Civiletatens Materialgård by several short rear wings, forming three interior courtyard spaces, the one closest to the canal entered directly from Frederiksholms Kanal and the two others through arched gateways in the barracks building. The ground floor was originally used for stables while there was residential quarters on the first floor and feed storage in the attic.
The buildings were listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in 1918, together with Civiletatens materialgård, and underwent restoration work conducted by Arkitema in 1996-97.
Hay Storage Building.
The Hay Storage Building ("Hømagasinet"), at 199 Vestervoldgade, its gable facing the alleyway, was originally built in 1740 for storage of hay for the King's Horses. The Royal Stables were located at Christiansborg Palace but fire hazard displaced the hay storage to the other side of the canal. The Hay Storage Building was destroyed in the fire 1798 fire which also hit the barracks building, and after that also stored hay for the Royal Horse Guards' horses. Much of the building was demolished in 1939 to make way for the Post Giro Building which was built to a design by Thorvald Jørgensen.
The Horse Guard Barracks today.
The building has been used by the Ministry of Education since 1927. Today it houses most of the Education Agency. There are also a number of residences facing the courtyard closest to Vester Voldgade.

Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention

The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention are a series of instructions to signatory nations regarding the proper implementation of the 1972 Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. The guidelines were adopted by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee at its first session and amended at its second session in 1978.
History.
The first text of the Operational Guidelines was titled Operational Guidelines for the World Heritage Committee. It dates back to 1977 at the First Session of the World Heritage Committee (27 June - 1 July) in Paris. The Drafting Committee and the World Heritage Committee prepared the text. It contained four chapters and twenty-eight paragraphs. In October same year, the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage with 27 paragraphs followed. A year later, at the Second Session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, the Operational Guidelines was adopted with 30 paragraphs.
The World Heritage Committee, the main body responsible for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention, has revised its text ever since adding paragraphs updating it with new concepts, knowledge or experiences. 
The 2011 Operational Guidelines is the latest version dating from November 2011 and available in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish. A revised Draft dating from February 2011 with limited distribution is available online.
Contents.
Introduction.
The 2011 version of the Operational Guidelines contains two hundred and ninety paragraphs which reflect the aim of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of the Cultural and Natural Heritage to further facilitate the Implementation of the 1972 Convention. 
The key users of the guidelines are not only the signatory nations. (States Parties to the 1972 Convention) The Secretariat of the World Heritage Committee based at the World Heritage Centre in Paris, the Advisory Bodies, site managers, stakeholders and partners all active in the protection of World Heritage properties are also invited to make usage of the Operational Guidelines.
Aim.
The first chapter of the Operational Guidelines aims to facilitate the implementation of the 1972 World Heritage Convention. The major goals and procedure of the Convention are given reflecting certain articles of the Convention in a more detailed explanation. 
The main bodies of the 1972 Convention i.e. the General Assembly, the World Heritage Committee, the Secretariat, the Advisory Bodies IUCN, ICOMOS, ICCROM are presented in detail precising their role, tasks, specific responsibilities, moreover meeting sessions, term of office, contact informations etc. A list of functions of the World Heritage Committee in cooperation with the States Parties is provided. Most functions derives from Articles 11(2+4+7), Article 13(6), Article 21(1+3) and Article 29(3) of the World Heritage Convention.
In general the overall aim of the Convention and its Guidelines is to safeguard heritage of universal value for future generations. Therefor to give a guidance on how properties can be inscribed on the World Heritage List or/and the List of World Heritage in Danger if the properties are facing serious dangers and are in need of emergency inscription.e.g. Birthplace of Jesus: Church of the Nativity and the Pilgrimage Route, Bethlehem inscribed in 2012. 
For the purpose of facilitating the nomination process for properties considered to be of universal value, World Heritage is defined so as to categorize heritage into cultural, natural, and mixed sites to be handled specifically. 
Other specific types of Heritage like e.g. Cultural landscape is a category of heritage acknowledged only since 1992 out of the need to recognize and protect the "combined work of man and nature". 
All informations consisting the World Heritage List and the way to it is to be found in Chapter 2.
Criteria for inscription.
Before properties can be proposed for inscription as a World Heritage Site, they must be on the tentative lists of the States Parties. The properties must be of Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) which means "cultural and/or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity". There are ten criteria for the assessement of OUV. Criteria (i)-(vi) for cultural heritage, (vii)-(x) for natural heritage. Properties nominated under criteria (i) to (vi)- cultural Heritage - must fulfill the conditions of authenticity i.e. originality in form and design, materials, use and function etc. Cultural and natural properties must satisfy the conditions of integrity i.e. wholeness, intactness. 
The term OUV is used throughout the World Heritage Convention but only defined and explained in detail in the Operational Guidelines from paragraphs 79-95. 
The protection and management systems should be in place to ensure that the OUV is kept and the Heritage is passed to future generations.
Process for Inscription.
The Operational Guidelines outlines the importance of participation of community and a wide range of stakeholders in the nomination process. It informs about the sources for help and guidance throughout the nomination process.(Chapter 3) 
Furthermore, detailed information is given for the inscription requirements for different types of properties. The nomination format Annex 5 must be used. The nomination file must be sent to the World Heritage Centre. The specific dates for submission and further processes and procedure for registration are also clarified. A nomination can be withdrawn any time prior to the Committee annual session in which nomination of properties take place. 
The World Heritage Committee decides for inscription of a property by adopting the Statement of OUV. (paragraph 154-157) If the decision is not to inscribe, the property may not be presented again. When additional information is needed the nomination will be referred (para 159) or deferred (para 160) for more in depth assessment or study. 
The Guidelines also reveal when conditions for deletion (Chapter IV.C ) of a World Heritage Site apply. e.g. Dresden Elbe Valley, and what steps are to be taken to ensure for the long-term protection and conservation of UNESCO sites.
Requirements.
To make sure that a World Heritage Site is protected and transmitted to future generations, the Operational Guidelines give directions to a more effective long-term conservation system i.e. a periodic reporting (Chapter 5 The World Heritage Committee has adopted the Format and Explanatory Notes to be found in Annex 7. State Parties are invited to submit Periodic reports every six years. The World Heritage Committee following the table set in paragraph 203 C will examine the reports.
The format consists of two Sections. Section I refers to the legislative and administrative provisions while section II refers to the state of conservation of specific World Heritage properties located on the territory of the State Party concerned. The address of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre for report submission can be found in Paragraph 207.

Saponarin

Saponarin is a flavone glucoside. It is found in "Saponaria officinalis" and in "Strongylodon macrobotrys" where it imparts the characteristic jade color to the flower. This coloration has been shown to be an example of copigmentation, a result of the presence of malvin (an anthocyanin) and saponarin in the ratio 1:9. Under the alkaline conditions (pH 7.9) found in the sap of the epidermal cells, this combination produced a blue-green pigmentation; the pH of the colorless inner floral tissue was found to be lower, at pH 5.6. Experiments showed that saponarin produced a strong yellow colouring in slightly alkaline conditions, resulting in the greenish tone of the flower. It is also found in passion flowers ("Passiflora sp.").

Middletown State Homeopathic Hospital

Middletown State Homeopathic Hospital was a hospital for the treatment of mental disorders located in Middletown, New York and opened on April 20, 1874. It was the first purely homeopathic hospital for mental disorders in the United States. The hospital employed a number of new techniques for the treatment of mental disorders, most notably the use of baseball as a therapy.
History.
The push for a state homeopathic institution for the treatment of mental disorders began in 1866 when John Stanton Gould delivered a speech to the State Homeopathic Medical Society entitled "The Relation of Insanity to Bodily Disease". In this speech, Gould asserted that "It has been my purpose in this address, gentlemen, to bring before you in a clear and specific form the proofs that insanity is always a symptom of bodily disease which it is your duty and ought to be your pleasure to cure." At the next meeting of the State Homeopathic Medical Society, they passed a resolution to push the New York State Legislature to construct an institution for the treatment of mental disorders along homeopathic lines. The state legislature approved a bill for the establishment of a State hospital in Middletown to use homeopathic therapy methods on April 28, 1870.
The hospital opened in 1874 with 69 patients. Henry Reed Stiles became the second superintendent of the hospital in 1875 and introduced strict dietary regimens. From 1877 until 1902, Dr. Seldon H. Talcott was the superintendent and developed a series of occupational therapy for all patients at Middletown. His treatment included art exhibitions, an institutional newsletter written by the patients ("The Conglomerate"), and athletics. The number of buildings and the number of patients grew reaching over 100 buildings and 2,250 people in the early 1900s and 3,686 in the 1960s. In 1901, Ralph Albert Blakelock became a patient at the hospital where he continued painting his landscapes. The services shifted primarily to outpatient therapy and numbers decreased. The institution permanently closed in 2006.
Baseball therapy.
While superintendent of the hospital, Seldon H. Talcott began using a range of physical activity as treatment for mental disorders. In 1888, they founded a team composed of patients, staff, and some of the best amateur baseball players in the region. The team began play in 1889 as the "Asylums" playing other teams in the region. By 1890, the team was playing regional teams from New York City and elsewhere winning 21 games out of 25. This included a split with the Cuban Giants, one of the top baseball teams at the time. In 1891, they narrowly lost a game with the New York Giants, who had finished 3rd in the National League that year, 4-3. In 1892, the team went undefeated except for two narrow losses to the New York Giants defeating the Cuban Giants, the New York Gothams, and many other teams from New York and New Jersey. Over the next few years, a number of excellent semi-pro players played for the Asylums. Many were recruited directly from the Asylums to professional baseball. With increased caseloads in the 1890s, the baseball focus of the Middletown hospital decreased and the Asylums withered away.

The Antigua and Barbuda Paralympic Committee (ABPC) was established on 15 March 2012. Its immediate purpose was to enable "the nation’s only Paralympic athlete", Jamol Pilgrim, to compete at the 2012 Games, as this required his country having a National Paralympic Committee. Pilgrim had been a sprinter with Olympic aspirations until a car accident in 2009 had resulted in his right leg being amputated above the knee. Now running with a prosthetic, he met the ‘A’ standard qualifying time in 2011 to compete in London. He took part in the men's 100m T42 sprint. Pilgrim was Antigua and Barbuda's only representative at the London Games, though the newly formed ABPC also took an interest in twelve year-old equestrian rider and right leg amputee Spadicia Harris.

Karim Abdul (born July 3, 1992) is a collegiate basketball player from Cameroon. He is currently playing for the UST Growling Tigers in the UAAP. He is also a football player for Dolphins United F.C. where he plays as goalkeeper.
UST Growling Tigers.
Rookie season.
Abdul joined the Tigers in 2011 as a walk-in applicant. In his rookie season, Abdul averaged 12.0 points per game, 11.7 rebounds per game, 1.5 assists per game, 1.0 steal per game and 1.5 blocks per game. Stepping up in the second round of eliminations together with veterans Jeric Teng, Jeric Fortuna and Chris Camus, Abdul and the Tigers finished the season in 4th place with an 8-6 record and returned to the Final Four. In their Final Four match-up against the Ateneo Blue Eagles, Abdul finished with a double-double 16 points and 16 rebounds with 2 steals and 2 blocks, but his efforts came up short as the Tigers were knocked out by the Blue Eagles to advance to the Finals 66-69.
Second season.
In his second season with the Tigers, Abdul went for a career high 24 points with 16 rebounds and 2 steals in a 72-73 loss against the FEU Tamaraws. The Tigers were able to advance to the UAAP Final Four as the #2 seed with a 10-4 record in the elimination round, they were able to defeat the NU Bulldogs to advance to the UAAP Finals and faced off against the Ateneo Blue Eagles but were swept in the Finals 2-0 as the Blue Eagles completed their five-peat. Abdul finished the season averaging 15.8 points per game, a league-leading 11.6 rebounds per game, 1.8 assists per game, a league-leading 1.5 steals per game (tied with Ray Ray Parks) and 1.7 blocks per game which is third in the UAAP on 45% field goal shooting and 60% free throw shooting. Abdul was named as a member of the Mythical Five for that season and finished second in the race for the season's Most Valuable Player award behind Ray Ray Parks.
In the Philippine Collegiate Champions League later that year, Abdul would play a key part in the Tigers run in the tournament as they first won the Metro Manila-Luzon tournament by defeating both the Letran Knights and the Adamson Soaring Falcons to enter into the PCCL Final Four with the Ateneo Blue Eagles, San Beda Red Lions and the Southwestern U Cobras. The Tigers would finish with a 2-1 record in the Final Four to set up a rematch with the Blue Eagles in the Finals, where the Tigers exacted their revenge against the Eagles as they were crowned the National Champions after winning the title in a tightly contested three game series. Abdul would later be named to the Mythical Five team for the tournament alongside teammates Jeric Fortuna and Jeric Teng who was crowned Finals MVP.
Third season.
In his third season with the Tigers, Abdul would continue his development and carried the team despite numerous injuries the Tigers players went through during the course of the elimination round. The Tigers would make their way back to the UAAP Finals for the 2nd straight season after surviving three knockout games which included their final elimination round game in which they knocked out the defending champion Ateneo Blue Eagles for the last Final Four slot, and stunning the top-seeded NU Bulldogs by winning two straight games to advance to the UAAP Finals where they battled the De La Salle Green Archers. In Game 1 of the series, Abdul would make a key defensive stop when he blocked LA Revilla's game winning layup as the Tigers held on to a 73-72 victory. However, the Archers responded with a Game 2 victory setting up a decisive Game 3. Abdul had a chance to win the game with a three pointer in overtime, but his shot went long as the Archers went on to win their first UAAP title since 2007. Abdul finished the season averaging 15.8 points per game, 11.2 rebounds per game, and 2.0 blocks per game on 48% shooting from the field and 71% shooting from the free throw line. Abdul would also be named to the Mythical Five for the second straight season together with UE's Roi Sumang, Season MVP Terrence Romeo of FEU, NU's Ray Ray Parks and La Salle's Jason Perkins.

Nawab of Rajoli

The term Nawab of Rajoli refers to the lineage of Zamindar of the Central Province in India.
A Nawab was originally the provincial governor or viceroy of a province or region of the Mughal empire. Since most of the Muslim rulers of the subcontinent had accepted the authority of the Mughals, the term "Nawab" is generally understood to mean any Muslim ruler in the subcontinent. Under British rule.
However the title is also much used as a prefix (similar to Lord in English peerage) by Muslim aristocrats or landed gentry in the subcontinent prior to Independence of India. The family he possessed the title “Nawab of Rajoli” by the local population and the British Government who had wide respect for his family. His family had strong ties with the British Government, and the senior British government officers were usually visited at his big and wide mansion at their time of visit.
History.
In 1851 Ragoji III of Nagpur State Given the Land for Zamindari On 108Rs on Token to Two Muslim Families, Gewardha in Chanda and Rajoli at Bhandara. The Hyatt Khan family was one of the two Muslim landlords in Nagpur Division whose property 23 Villages in total including the jagir of 14 villages in Rajoli expanded it to 32.In 1863 zamindar of Rajoli Hyatt Khan marriage her only daughter Sajida Begum to a son of tobacco Businessman of Bhandara Named Nawaz Mohammad. After the death of Hyatt khan her only daughter Sajida begum held the title as heiress presumptive of Rajoli Zamindari and Nawaz Mohammad Become Chief of Rajoli Zamndari.
After Independence of India in 1947,Zamindari System is abolished in India Last ruling chief of Rajoli Nawab Nazir Mohammad immigrated to City Of Bhandara. the name was changed and the Rajoli zamindar and family were to be known as Ahmad.Nawab Nazir Ahmad Died On sept. 1989. Nawab Nazir Ahmad Has left three surviving sons, Niyaz Ahmad, Nisar Ahmad, Naim Ahmad and three Daughters.

Drummoyne Rowing Club

Drummoyne Rowing Club, formed in 1919 in Sydney, Australia is one of four rowing clubs on Iron Cove in Sydney Harbour. It has occupied its current site at Sister's Bay, Drummoyne since its foundation. The DRC is a community based competitive and recreational rowing club with a long history in welcoming women members. It offers programs at club and master's level and leases it facilities for some schools' programs.
History.
A.C Ingham, a Drummoyne Alderman and Quarton Deloitte Sydney Rowing Club President and Mr W.A Hence of the NSW Rowing Association presided over a public meeting at the Drummoyne Town Hall on 28 August 1919 which was called for the purpose of forming a rowing club at Drummoyne. The Enterprise Rowing Club on the other side of the Cove at Balmain had been destroyed by a fierce gale in August 1918. A number of Enterprise Club members were Drummoyne residents and there was an interest in rebuilding across the river. Fred Cronin, Wally Kolts, Bill Witt Senior and Junior, George McKenzie, Lance Wearne & Norm Barrell were the Enterprise members instrumental in the DRC's foundation. The first committee was elected on 1 September 1919 with Ingham as Chairman and Cronin as Secretary. The club chose to welcome women members from its inception.
The clubhouse's foundations were laid in its present position in Sister's Bay in November 1919. Ingham owned a timber yard and supplied materials at cost as well as standing as guarantor for the club to its bank lender. The club's first boat purchase around that same time was a four-oared boat from George Towns & Sons. Much of the building work was done by volunteers and the clubhouse was finally completed in September 1921 and opened by the Governor Sir Walter Davidson.
In 1966 a liquor license was obtained by which stage membership numbers had grown to 205 and a new licensed clubhouse was opened in 1968 with dining room extensions completed by 1975. A new boathouse was rebuilt in the mid 1980s. The licensed club ran into financial difficulties in the new millennium and ceased operation from 2010.
The rowing club still continues and its members compete in club, state and national regattas.

Parent body

In meteoritics, a parent body is the celestial body from which originates a meteorite or a class of meteorites.
Identification.
The easiest way to correlate a meteorite with a parent body is, when the parent body still exists. This is the case for Lunar and Martian meteorites. Samples from Lunar meteorites can be compared with samples from the Apollo program. Martian meteorites can be compared to analysis carried out by rovers (e.g. Curiosity).
Meteorites can also be compared to spectral classes of asteroids. In order to identify the parent body of a class of meteorites, scientists compare their albedo and spectra with other known bodies. These studies show that some meteorite classes are closely related to some asteroids. The HED meteorites for example are correlated with 4 Vesta. Another, perhaps most useful way to classify meteorites by parent bodies is by grouping them according to composition, with types from each hypothetical parent body clustering on a graph. Meteoriticists have tentatively linked extant meteorites to 100-150 parent bodies; far fewer than the ~1 million main-belt asteroids larger than a kilometer, this apparent sampling bias remains an area of active research.

Nana was, according to a falsified charter dated to 1135, bishop of Pécs () in the Kingdom of Hungary. Although the charter itself was not authentic, its compiler plausibly used an original charter from the same period. Therefore, the exitence of a bishop of Pécs named Nana in the 1130s can be accepted. All the same, Nana only administered his diocese for one or two years, because his successor is mentioned for the first time in 1136.

MetTrans

MetTrans (“Metal Transport in the Environment”) is a four-year Marie Curie Initial Training Network of leading European research groups in both academic and industrial institutions, which addresses outstanding issues in the migration of metals in the environment.
The Network provides young scientists with high quality personalised training in both research and complementary skills. There are 13 research work plans in the MetTrans network: each includes a single research project led by a PhD student (early-stage researcher - ESR) or by a post-doctoral fellow (experienced researcher - ER).
MetTrans is a €3.5 million project funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Programme. The project started on February 1, 2012, and will run until January 31, 2016.
Overall description of MetTrans.
Understanding the processes that control the transport of metals is essential for a wide range of fields, including environmental protection and remediation, mineral resources, and climate change.
Through recent analytical developments, it is now possible to use natural variations in metal isotopes to obtain new information on how metal behavior in natural waters is controlled by interactions with mineral surfaces, by biological activity, and by release during mineral weathering. This will significantly advancing our understanding of the transport of both natural and contaminant metals Trans research will address a diversity of metal transport research questions using shared analytical, experimental, and theoretical approaches. This provides a platform for training young scientists in using of isotopic methods, understanding metal behaviour, and utilizing skills broadly.
The Network focuses on providing training on analytical skills, on understanding fundamental principles, and on modelling, and exposes young scientists to a wide range of opportunities for applying this training in research and industry.

Proto (band)

Proto is a six-member progressive rock band, originally from Memphis, moved to Chattanooga (Tennessee) early January 2003, after recording their first EP release with new label Torrent Records LLC. Shaun West (drummer now for over ten years) and J. Mark Crider (having played together for over 8 years) began Proto with Erik Berkes in 2002.
In the fall of 2003, the band began preparing for their first release to prelude the full-length album. Proto asked violinist Krista Wroten (schooled in classical music training at Boston University) if she was interested in playing on the CD to fill out some of the songs. What began only as an addition to the record became an addition to the band. It was obvious that Krista belonged after hearing her play.
They quickly recruited lead guitarist Benjamin Mansfield (with Erik Berkes have been writing and playing now for over five years) and wrote their first song, "The Backwards Waltz". The song embodied a mutual frustration within the band towards ignorance and the destruction of the human mind. It was from this collaboration that the band realized their potential and agreed to pursue a serious career in music. The music immediately took precedence over everything else in their lives.
The band as a whole has been together just under three years, but the chemistry and direction are unshakable. Partnered in motivation and destination, Proto continues to write new material for their first full-length album due out in 2004. After recording, the band left Memphis for Chattanooga. They started new lives and began writing the clearest music ever.
Other projects of members of Proto are "All Things Green" and "North American Royalty, this last formed by ultra melodic female vocal fueled Elise Berkes on lead vocals & guitar. Krista Wroten of Proto on violin and vocals, Jack Kirton of Proto on guitar, mandolin & steel guitar, Dennis Hubbard and Joey Berkley from All Things Green on bass & percussion. Real fresh pretty stuff backed by well seasoned local musicians.
Their first song "Monkey" of the self-titled album was used in introduction of the movie Devour (2005), starring Jensen Ackles of Supernatural, and in the third season of Roswell.

It's a Family Affair-We'll Settle It Ourselves

"It's a Family Affair-We'll Settle It Ourselves" (Svoi lyudi - sotchtemsya, Свои люди - сочтемся) is a comedy by Alexander Ostrovsky. It was his first major work, written in 1849 and published in the No.6 (March, book 2) 1850 "Moskvityanin" issue. It was immensely successful and was promptly banned. The play was staged for the first time on 9 December 1860, ten years after its publication. For some time the play has also been referred to as "The Bankrupt" (its original title).
Background.
After his first attempt to write a play, called "The Legal Request" (Iskovoye proshenuye) failed Ostrovsky started working upon another storyline, again stemming from his experience in the Moscow commercial court. Uncertain in his own potential he invited friend Tertiy Filippov to become a co-author, the latter refused. Then somehow Dmitry Gorev (real surname Tarasenko) emerged, a mystery figure of whom nothing is known besides the fact that he was a son of a merchant who lived not far from Ostrovskys’ (and later turned bankrupt), and who published a drama called "Tzar the Liberator or the Poor Orphan" in 1843. It was Gorev who suggested that they'd work upon the play together. Several scenes of Act 1 finished, Gorev suddenly refused to continue and left Moscow. He was not seen until 1853 when he re-emerged to accuse Ostrovsky of stealing the text he, Gorev, was co-author of.
History.
Ostrovsky was working on "The Bankrupt" all through 1847 and 1848. By the end of 1849 it has been finished. Ostrovsky's first audience was his University friend Alexey Pisemsky. At this time he met the now famous author Prov Sadovsky who saw the comedy as a revelation and started to recite in Moscow literary circles. In the summer Ostrovsky read the play at Mikhail Katkov's in Merzlyakovsky Lane where another Moscow University professor, I.V.Belyaev was also present. Instantly the author’s got a word-of-mouth reputation in the academic circles. Both Ostrovsky and Sadovsky started to receive invitations to the houses of Moscow cultural elite (Nikolai and Karolina Pavlovy, Alexander Veltman, professors Shevyryov and Pogodin, at Meshchersky's and Sheremetyev's, even in the astronomer A.N.Drashusov's observatory) where they became frequent guests since the autumn of 1849. Ivan Goncharov, who was in Moscow on his way from Petersburg to Simbirsk, has heard the "Bankrupt", liked it a lot and recommended Ostrovsky to send the play to Krayevsky's "Otechestvennye Zapiski", but the author decided against it, still hoping to get the censorship permission. 
In November 1849 Sadovsky read the play at Countess Rostopchina's and she called the play "our Russian Tartuffe" and expressed delight at being the witness to "the birth of our own theatre literature." It was Rastopchina's opinion that made Mikhail Pogodin active in trying to obtain the play and on November 24, 1849 he sent a note to professor Shevyryov asking for his assistance (which he indeed has got) and then asked Nikolai Berg to invite Ostrovsky to his home. On December 3 Ostrovsky read the play to the audience which included Veltman, Lev Mei, the actor Shchepkin and, most notably, Nikolai Gogol. The success was immense although at least one of the guests, Veltman, expressed his reservations, concerning the longevity of the reading.
Publication.
The play was finally published in the March (#6) issue of "Moskvityanin" under the new title "It's a Family Affair-We'll Settle It Ourselves". The play in which the uncultured, self-satisfied merchant class was strikingly portrayed, has made Ostrovsky instantly famous in Moscow but soon was banned from being produced on theater stage.
"The Bankrupt caused furor in the city," "Moskvityanin" editor-in-chief Mikhail Pogodin wrote in a diary on March 20, four days after the #6 of the magazine was issued. Ostrovsky became a star in Moscow overnight. Governor Zakrevsky made a personal effort to support the staging of the play but suddenly the situation worsened. "The "Family"’s success touched many of the Moscow merchant big cats and it caused indignation of many an influential people. Reports started flying to Petersburg", Modest Pisarev, and actor and Ostrovsky's future publisher wrote. The Theater and Literature Committee banned the play, issuing a report in which it condemned its negativism, pessimism and the lack of "positive examples" even if admitting that it contained nothing that would abuse the censorial rules directly. Nikolai I signed the document and left a note on it, with a question: "Who is this Ostrovsky, the author of "Family Affair"?" which has prompted one of his aids Count Orlov send a request to the 3rd Department's Moscow office. The secret police promptly maintained surveillance over the author who was still working in the court. In a letter to Russian Minister of Education Ostrovsky admitted the play must have had certain flaws, but added:
Countess Rastopchina passed this text to Gogol. "I find his answer most sensible. God help him in his future work and the ability to express clearer his ideas’ well-meaning so as to dispel all doubts as to that", the later wrote back. 
Rather frightened by the official reaction, Ostrovsky has made a visit to Zakrevsky. "This only gives more honour to you", the governor reassured the young author with an unexpected argument. Moscow loved intellectuals persecuted by Petersburg and soon Ostrovsky discovered that this dissident's sheen was making him much more attractive to the local elite. On May 9, 1850, Ostrovsky found himself invited to Gogol's birthday party.
In 1860 "Family Affair" was finally declared eligible for stage production. This happened only after Ostrovsky has made several changes and the directors of Imperial theaters supported it, giving as a reason (sensibly enough) not the play's virtues but the horrible state of theatrical repertoire. With the ban lifted for that reason, in the early 1861 "Family Affair" was premiered in Saint Petersburg as Yulia Linskaya's benefice and had immense success. Two weeks later it was staged by Maly Theatre in Moscow, Ostrovsky and the troupe (with Prov Sadovsky as Podkhalyuzin, making a forfeit of reproducing by gesture all those details cut out by the author) were given long ovation and several hundred people followed Ostrovsky and his friends to his house.

François Dominique Séraphin (15 February 1747 – 5 December 1800) was a French entertainer who developed and popularised shadow plays in France. The art form would go on to be copied across Europe.
Shadow plays.
The art of using shadows to form figures onto a screen can be traced back to 9th-century Indonesia and China. European travellers saw these "Ombres Chinoises" (Chinese shadows) and returned home with descriptions of their performance. Séraphin introduced his version of the act at the back of a Versailles inn during the early 1770s. Though he started the show in humble beginnings they became such a success, including regular visits from the aristocracy, that Séraphin would go on to perform at the Palace of Versailles in front of royalty.
In 1784 Séraphin moved to Paris, performing his shows at the newly opened Palais-Royal from 8 September 1784. During this time Marie Antoinette visited three of his plays. The performances would continue though the French Revolution. Séraphin died in 1800 but his shows continued initially under the direction of his nephew until the theatre closed in 1870. 
Séraphin had adapted the Ombres Chinoises and devised new methods to control the shadow-throwing puppets. Rather than use hidden performers moving the parts of the silhouetted puppets, Séraphin developed the use of clockwork mechanisms to automate the show. He made a variety of devices and performed several different acts including "Le Chasse aux canards" (The Duck Hunt), "Le Magicien Rothomago" (Rothomago the Magician), and "L'Embarras du ménage" (The Embarrassment of the Household). Amongst Séraphin's most popular works was "Le Pont Cassé" (The Broken Bridge), a play based on a musical piece by Louis-Gabriel Guillemain. At the height of popularity the most famous of Séraphin's shadow plays were reproduced so that children could perform them. Script details and paper versions of the characters were made in Épinal, Nancy, and Augsburg. Children would stick the characters to cardboard and cut them out, performing their own versions of the stories in small toy theatres.
Séraphin is seen as the most important figure in the development of the art form. His work is believed to have been seen by Philip James de Loutherbourg, giving him inspiration for his mechanical work including the "Eidophusikon". Techniques used to create the shadow plays were also replicated and combined with other emerging technologies, including magic lanterns, to form phantasmagoria shows.

Jane Chen

Jane Marie Chen is the co-founder of Embrace, a social enterprise startup that aims to help the 20 million premature and low birth-weight babies born every year, through a low-cost infant warmer.
Currently, Chen serves as Chief Business Officer of Embrace Innovations, which has a mission to design and bring to market healthcare technologies for the developing world, starting with the infant warmer. The Embrace infant warmer costs about 1% of a traditional incubator, and is currently being distributed across clinics in India, with pilots being conducted in 10 countries. The Embrace infant warmer is estimated to have helped over 50,000 babies to date.
Chen served as the first Chief Executive Officer of Embrace, the non-profit arm of the organization, before stepping into the CEO role for Embrace Innovations, the for-profit social enterprise that was spun off in 2012. She is now the Chief Business Officer at Embrace Innovations.
Early life and education.
Chen's early education was at Upland High School, in Upland, CA.
Chen holds a BA in Psychology and Economics from Pomona College, a Masters in Public Administration from Harvard University, and an MBA from Stanford University.
Career.
Prior to Embrace, Chen worked with nonprofit organizations on healthcare issues in developing countries. She spent several years as the Program Director of a startup HIV/AIDS nonprofit in China (Chi Heng Foundation), and worked for the Clinton Foundation’s HIV/AIDS Initiative in Tanzania. She also worked at Monitor Group as a management consultant, advising Fortune 500 companies.
Chen has been a TED speaker, and was selected as one of Forbes' Impact 30 in 2011. In 2011, Chen was also recognized as the Inspirational Young Alumni of the Year by Pomona College, and was the keynote speaker at Stanford’s Women in Management event in the same year. She is also featured in Stanford’s “Tradition of Innovation,” and speaks at various international conferences, including the Skoll World Forum.
In 2012, Chen was named as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum, and was featured in Dove's "Real Role Models" campaign for women and girls. She is also profiled in AOL’s Makers campaign. Chen is a TED India Fellow, TED Senior Fellow, Echoing Green Fellow, and Rainer Arnhold Fellow.
In 2013, Chen and the other co-founders of Embrace, Linus Liang, Nag Murty, and Rahul Panicker were awarded the prestigious Economist Innovation Award, under the category of Social and Economic Innovation. In the same year, Chen and her co-founder Rahul Panicker were also recognized as Schwab Social Entrepreneurs of the Year by the World Economic Forum.
Embrace.
While doing her MBA at Stanford, Chen and a few other fellow graduate students were assigned a class project to create a low-cost infant incubator that could be used in rural areas. In 2008, they co-founded Embrace, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, to bring their project to life. In January 2012, Embrace moved into a hybrid structure. The non-profit entity, Embrace, donates infant warmers to the neediest areas through NGO partners, and provides educational programs on newborn health alongside the distribution of warmers. The for-profit social enterprise, Embrace Innovations, sells the warmers to paying entities, including governments and private clinics, all focusing on emerging markets. Embrace believes that this type of "hybrid" structure allows it to most effectively achieve its mission: to supply its infant warmers to every baby in need. Embrace Innovations, the for-profit social enterprise, raised its Series A round of financing in 2012 from Vinod Khosla's Impact Fund and Capricorn Investment Group.
Embrace Innovations' vision is to develop a line of disruptive healthcare technologies to reduce infant mortality in developing countries.

Khvamli

Khvamli () or Khomli (ხომლი) is a limestone massif in western Georgia, located on the territories of Tsageri and Tsqaltubo municipalities and forming the watershed division between the Rioni and Tskhenis-Tsqali river valleys. It stands at and forms a double cuesta, consisting of Cretaceous limestone units and covered by mixed forests. It presents to the south a bluff face of height. Both cuestas have a northward-facing scarp perforated by numerous sinkholes and caves. Most important of the caves is called Tekenteri (თეკენთერი) and has only one entrance—through the hollow of a large beech tree. 
The caves of Khvamli feature in the 14th-century Georgian chronicle as the abode of treasures of the kings of Georgia. A local legend also makes Prometheus enchained to the bluffs of Khvamli, being perpetually tortured by a raven.
Tekenteri cave.
The Tekenteri cave is located at above sea level. Its only entrance—the hole of a large beech tree—has no bottom but the karst sinkhole deep, with a lake of cold, clean water. A water stream stemming from it flows through a horizontal passage to form a waterfall, judging by noises from the depths. There are many metal buckets and pitchers floating in the lake, suggesting that cave water had been used by locals for many years.
History and culture.
Khvamli is located in the western portion of the historical Georgian province of Lechkhumi. The name of Khvamli stems for an old Georgian word for a constellation and the rock, according to the 18th-century scholar Prince Vakhushti, was named so because of its height. 
The "royal treasures" (სამეფო საჭურჭლე, "samep'o sach'urch'le") hidden in the caves of Khvamli (Khomli) is mentioned by the 14th-century anonymous Georgian "Chronicle of a Hundred Years" in connection with the division of the Kingdom of Georgia between the two cousins, David VI and David VII, during the period of the Mongol hegemony in 1259. The two Davids divided the lands and vassal nobles, but from the Khomli treasure only certain articles were taken, of which the share falling to David VI was "the famous chain of diamonds, the superb jewel cut in the form of an anvil and a great pearl, of which the like was never seen". Much of the treasure, the chronicle states, remained hidden in the caves. The 19th-century French historian Marie-Félicité Brosset reports that excavations made at Khvamli by Prince Dadiani in the 1840s yielded no result. 
Khvamli also housed a church of St. George probably built in the 12th or 13th century, of which only ruins remain. Digs in 1910 revealed a medieval Georgian stone inscription recording the name of the church's donor, Ioane, "eristavi" ("duke") of the Svans. 
Of a series of legends, the one identifying Khvamli as the site of punishment of Prometheus, or his local counterpart, Amirani, feature in some 19th-century European travel accounts and even found its way in Jules Verne's "Kéraban the Inflexible", which mentions "the rock of Khomli, overlooking Koutais, to which Prometheus was bound, and where the vultures eternally feed upon his entrails as a punishment for having stolen the bolts of heaven". Another local legend explains the alternating course of the nearby Verdzistava spring with the movement of an immortal dragon living in the caves of Khvamli. There is also a holiday called "Khvamloba" celebrated in nearby villages on July 20.
Archaeological surveys of the Khvamli area in the 2000s was a focus of coverage by the Georgian media, which also ran stories about alleged Nazi and Soviet KGB covert operations in search of the Georgian royal treasure.
Environmental issues.
The territory of Khvamli is a protected area in Georgia and borders with the Tvishi dam, which is projected to serve the proposed Namakhvani Hydro Power Plant cascade. In 2011, environmental groups expressed fears that the project might have a negative impact on the Khvamli reserve.

Christian Lawyers Association v Minister of Health

Christian Lawyers Association v Minister of Health is a case in which the Transvaal Provincial Division of the High Court of South Africa ruled on the constitutionality of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, the law which governs abortion in South Africa. The Christian Lawyers Association claimed that abortion violates section 11 of the Constitution, which provides that "Everyone has the right to life." The government noted an exception (a demurrer) on the grounds that constitutional rights do not apply to fetuses and that there was therefore no case to answer. The court accepted the government's argument and the case was dismissed.

Commwarrior (computer virus)

Commwarrior is a Symbian Bluetooth worm that was the first to spread via Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Bluetooth. The worm affects only the Nokia Series 60 software platform.
Infection.
Commwarrior was particularly effective via the MMS vector it used to infect other phones. It appeared as though it had been sent from a source that was known to the victim, leading even security-conscious users to open the infected message. Actually, the message was sent at random to a contact in the sender's address book.
Once the message is opened, the virus attempts to install itself on the phone via a SIS file. This SIS file works in a similar manner to that of a Windows .EXE file and once it runs, the worm is executed every time the phone is switched on.
A secondary method of infection is to create a malicious .SIS file on a compromised phone. Once per minute thereafter, the worm attempts to send this file to any phones that have Bluetooth enabled.
Symptoms.
According to Sophos, during installation the program has a one in six chance of displaying the following text: "CommWarrior v1.0 (c) 2005 by e10d0r"
Prevalence.
Commwarrior is obsolete, because this worm only works Nokia Series 60.

Nisbets

Nisbets is the UK's leading mail order company for catering equipment and catering supplies. Based in Avonmouth, Bristol, Nisbets has expanded across multiple countries in Europe and Oceania.
Background.
In 1983 Andrew Nisbet identified a potential gap in the catering supplies market. Many catering students around the country all needed the same things: a pair of shoes, a coat, trousers, a hat and a set of knives, but had no central agency to purchase from. He decided to begin knocking on the doors of catering colleges, supplying that demand. The first catalogue was a simple price list, showing the key items that Nisbets still sells today.
The company was first based in Prewett Street, Redcliffe, Bristol, selling catering student essentials. By 1986, Nisbets was large enough to warrant a move to a new site, and moved just a mile north east in Bristol to Waterloo Street in Old Market, where it operated from until 1995.
Nisbets moved to Aztec West in 1995, and then to Fourth Way in Avonmouth in 2004. The concept of “Next Day Delivery” became central to the business while based in Aztec West; this core benefit to the customer remains central to the Nisbets ethos today.
Since its inception, the company has grown swiftly and intelligently and now supplies restaurants, cafes, bars, pubs, hotels, the professional chef, caterers and commercial kitchens.
With over 600 onsite employees and revenues of £180 million, Nisbets is considered Europe's largest supplier of catering equipment.
Store Locations.
Nisbets operates from two large warehouses in Avonmouth, Bristol. They now have offices in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Ireland and Australia. 
Their export division now exports to over 100 countries worldwide.
Product range.
Nisbets supply to both consumer and domestic markets. Their product range covers heavy duty items for bigger catering institutions such as warewashing machines, refrigerators and cooking machines, smaller items such as beverage machines, blenders and food preparation machines. They also supply ranges of cutlery, crockery, glassware, buffet display and barware, as well as essential kitchen supplies like knives, utensils, cookware, pastry items, clothing and furniture.
Nisbets maintains a commitment to process all orders the same day they're received, offering free next day delivery across most of the UK. Nisbets were also the recipient of Restaurant Magazine's "Equipment Distributor of the Year" for 2009/2010.

Heather Von St. James (born January 5, 1969) is an American cancer survivor, cancer research advocate, and blogger. Von St. James serves as a mesothelioma research funding advocate and conference speaker for the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization and Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation. 
Von St. James was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma in 2005 at the age of 36. She received her diagnosis just after the birth of her first child, Lily. 
In February of 2006, Von St. James underwent extensive thoracic surgery, known as extrapleural pneumonectomy, with adjuvant intra-operative heated chemotherapy under the care of thoracic surgeon Dr. David Sugarbaker at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. She was declared cancer-free later that year. 
Von St. James’ recovery from the disease is clinically unique because malignant mesothelioma is a rare, aggressive cancer typically diagnosed in older patients that, even with treatment, has a 6 to 9 month median survival rate. Mesothelioma, commonly caused by exposure to asbestos, typically only manifests after a 25-30-year latency period following exposure.

Makar of Esztergom

Makar was a prelate in the Kingdom of Hungary in the first half of the 12th century. He was successively provost of Titel around 1127, bishop of Pécs between around 1136 and around 1139, and finally archbishop of Esztergom until around 1146.
Life.
Makar is first mentioned in a fragmentary charter he issued as royal notary in the reign of King Stephen II of Hungary. The charter is dated to the period between 1125 and 1128, and refers to him as the head or provost of the collegiate chapter at Titel (now in Serbia).
Makar is first mentioned as bishop (but without any reference to his see) at the beginning of 1137. This year he participated at the assembly where Ladislaus, a younger son of King Béla II of Hungary was proclaimed duke of Bosnia. In the list of the participants, Makar is only preceded by the archbishop of Esztergom. His see at Pécs is revealed in a charter issued for the collegiate chapter at Dömös by King Béla II on September 3, 1138. Makar seems to have been transferred to the see of Esztergom in some years, because three charters issued between 1142 and 1146 refer to one "Archbishop Makar".

Walter Giffard, Lord of Longueville

Walter Giffard, Lord of Longueville, Normandy (a.k.a. 'Giffard of Barbastre'), was a Norman baron, a Tenant-in-chief in England, a Christian knight who fought against the Saracens in Spain during the Reconquista and one of the known Companions of William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.
Life.
Walter was the son of Osborne de Bolbec, Lord of Longueville and Avelina, sister of Gunnora, Duchess of Normandy. As such he was a cousin of William the Conqueror.
From the mid 1040s Walter's name appears among the loyal supporters of William the Conqueror. Walter was at the Battle of Mortemer and was among the Norman barons who surprised and defeated Counts Odo and Renaud leading the French contingent attacking Normandy from the east. In particular, he and another great vassal Robert of Eu encountered Odo's army encamped in the village of Mortemer with no sentries and the soldiers were drunk. The Normans attacked the French while they slept, most being either killed or taken prisoner. While Odo himself escaped, when King Henry I learned of the fate of his brother Odo's army he promptly withdrew his remaining forces and left Normandy. In 1054 Walter was in charge of maintaining the siege of Arques castle, against William of Talou, who had rebelled against the Conqueror.
Like many other Norman and French knights during the eleventh and early twelfth centuries, Walter served as a Christian knight in Spain () against the Saracens. His epithet "le Barbastre" was earned when he took part in the Siege of Barbastro, an undertaking sanctioned by Pope Alexander II against the Moors in 1064, one of the more famous exploits of that time. By the time of the Conquest, Walter had returned to Normandy bearing a gift of the King of Spain for Duke William, a magnificent war-horse. The same Spanish war-horse duke William called for on the morning of the Battle of Hastings. The Spanish king in question was in all probability Sancho Ramírez of Aragon (1063–94) who was known for making friends and recruiting knights and soldiers from Northern France. Walter was also one of the first, if not "the" first in England to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, which he did after the siege of Barbastro and before returning to Normandy.
In early January of 1066, after Duke William received news of the crowning of Harold Godwinson as king of England, he called together a meeting that included six of his key magnates, Walter Giffard being one of them. After telling them of his plan to invade England and take the crown they all advised him they supported him fully but suggested he call a meeting of all his vassals, which William did. In the preparation stage for the Battle of Hastings, Walter was one of the Norman magnates who provided ships for William's invasion fleet. In his case, he provided thirty. Walter was one of two who, having been offered the privilege of carrying William's standard in the battle, respectfully refused. Although by this time an older warrior with white hair, he wanted both hands free to fight. As a reward for his participation, Walter was granted 107 lordships, 48 of which were in Buckinghamshire. The date of his death is not recorded, but his son Walter succeeded him before 1085.

Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center

The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center is a museum of Native American culture in Mashantucket, Connecticut, owned and operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation.
Overview.
The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, located near the tribe's Foxwoods Resort Casino, opened August 11, 1998. The facility was built at a cost of $193.4 million, largely funded by casino revenues. It includes a museum and resources for scholarly research on the histories and cultures of the native peoples of the United States and Canada.
Museum exhibits.
The museum's permanent collection includes artifacts of Native American peoples of eastern North America from the 16th century to the 20th century, as well as commissioned art works and traditional crafts by modern Native Americans. A series of interactive exhibits and life-size three-dimensional dioramas depicts the lifeways and history of the Mashantucket Pequot and their ancestors from the last glacial period through modern times. One highlight is a walk-through re-creation of a coastal Pequot village around the year 1550, shortly before the first contact with Europeans. The village is populated by 51 life-size figures of Indians engaged in activities such as building wigwams, sharpening arrows, and weaving mats. A photomural of an oak-hickory forest surrounds the village.
A observation tower allows visitors to view the Mashantucket Pequot reservation, the casino, and surrounding areas of southeastern Connecticut.
The museum reports having about 250,000 visitors each year. A reviewer for "Connecticut Magazine" described the museum as "rival anything in the nation" and commented that the Pequot village reconstruction and other dioramas "almost put EPCOT to shame".
Facility.
The glass and steel building complex that houses the museum and research center was designed by New York City architects Polshek and Partners. The building design is intended to blend and merge with the surrounding natural landscape. A circular building, the Gathering Space, forms the focal center of the complex and serves as its main entry. Elements of the design are based on the plan of the Pequot fort at Mystic, Connecticut, that played an important role in the tribe's history. The complex received several awards for design and construction, including: 
In 2006, the museum building's green roof, which covers , was recognized with a Green Roof Award of Excellence.

Axioma

Axioma is a firm that provides factor-based risk models and portfolio construction tools for equity investors.
Founding and Early History.
Axioma is headquartered in New York City, and was founded by Associate Professor of Decision Risk and Operations Sebastián Ceria of the Columbia Business School in 1998. The company was founded in order for Ceria to tap into the growing trend of computer software being used in supply-chain management logistics, bringing that methodology into the financial sector under the name Dash Optimization Holdings. Dash Optimization would later change its name to Axioma. The company's first client was Goldman Sachs, and since then they have accrued a client base composed of large asset managers and investment banks.
Portfolio Optimization and Risk Models.
The company produces software and tools, including the Portfolio Optimizer, which enables portfolio managers to manage their current holdings. This includes managing "intended" and the "unintended" bets taken in any portfolio—the things that fund managers see, and the things they have overlooked in terms of risk management. The optimizer is also used to manage the amount of trading and transaction costs associated with portfolio rebalancing, and to manage the trade-off between the return and risk performance of the portfolio. Axioma’s Robust Risk Models include both fundamental factor risk models, which use factors such as industry, value, leverage, growth and momentum, and statistical factor risk models, which use statistical factors. All of the models are updated daily, and can be used to build portfolios from the ground up, in addition to providing analytical results after the fact.
Axioma’s optimization software combines linear, quadratic and second-order cone algorithms. Portfolio managers can manage the number of names held or traded using integer constraints, as well as continuous data signals. Branch-and-bound methods are used to deal with combinatorial restrictions. Robust optimization allows portfolio managers to introduce estimation error into the results. Axoma’s software allows managers to control market impact, transaction costs, tax implications, sector and industry bets, minimum/maximum holdings, and other portfolio elements. Axioma's products are used by five out of the ten largest asset management firms. Additional tools offered by Axioma include the Axioma Performance Attribution and the Axioma Backtester.
Russell-Axioma Indices.
In 2008 Axioma started a joint venture with Russell Investments, producing a set of factor indices, a venture triggered by the growing use of factor models in the financial industry and concern about high risk management. The use of these factors in reading the markets has varied, as well as compounded, over the years. These indices include the Russell-Axioma U.S. Small Cap Low Volatility Index, the Russell-Axioma Developed ex-U.S. Large Cap Low Volatility Index, and the Russell-Axioma U.S. Large Cap Low Volatility Index.
The 2010s.
In 2010 their models showed that asset-asset correlations were at an all time high, and that this trend would continue well into the future due to risk aversion in the marketplace. CEO Sebastián Ceria stated in 2011 that due to market volatility, market gains were based more on world events than individual news from businesses, creating a climate where factors were becoming increasingly important to determining value in the markets. 
In 2012, Axioma released several white papers on the effects of lumping low-volatility stocks together in ETFs, showing how higher volatility can follow such practices, warning that greater diligence would be needed in vetting financial products like factor-based ETFs. Ceria stated that, other than looking at macro-factors, the risk factors that needed to be addressed in order to avoid such pitfalls on the non-macro-level included the momentum of stock, the size of the company, value growth or leverage, and volatility. This led Axioma to publicly advocate volatility-tracking ETFs versus their competitors, like the Russell 1000 Low Volatility ETF.
Personnel.
Axioma's staff is a combination of financial sector employees and software developers. Sebastián Ceria is the current CEO of Axioma. Axioma's Managing Director of Europe and Asia is Olivier D'Assier, former VP of Barra, Inc. for Asia Pacific and president of Barra Japan. These executives have been guests on financial news channels to discuss risk management, including Bloomberg Television, CNBC, and Fox Business. Ceria has also published the work of Axioma in refereed publications, including a chapter in "The Oxford Handbook of Quantitative Asset Management". Other executives that have published research done by Axioma include vice president and Chief Technology Officer Stefan Schmieta, former member of the Computational Optimization Research Center at Columbia University; vice president of research Robert Stubbs; Director of Applied Research Anthony Renshaw, former Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University, and Senior Research Associate Dieter Vandenbussche, former Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The current Chairman of Axioma is William Guttman, who also serves as a Special Advisor to the Provost of Carnegie Mellon University and was cofounder of the education technology firm Panopto.

Stay in Your Own Sled

Stay in Your Own Sled (), an idiom meaning "Don't bite off more than you can chew," is a play by Alexander Ostrovsky, written in 1852 and first published in the No.5 (March, book 1), 1853, issue of "Moskvityanin". It was premiered in Bolshoi Theatre on January 14, 1853.
History.
By 1852 all of Ostrovsky's work, including a translation, has been banned from being produced on stage. Years later he wrote: "The author, especially the one who is just starting, and who’s got one or two plays banned without reasons explained, starts becomes a slave to fear… Once he’s come across a long idea - he shortens it, once he's managed a strong character, he weakens it, once he’s found fiery. Weighty phrases, he smoothens them for in all this he starts to see reason for future prohibitions." His new play was the result of such inner compromise: it was a melodrama, less daring as "Family Affair" and not as ambitious as "The Poor Bride", lots of sherp edges in characters apparently having been smoothened in the course of working upon them. The main character, Rusakov, was based on a real person, merchant Kosheverov (Prov Sadovsky's relative) who always delighted Ostrovsky with his openness and easy ways with money.
The play, originally called "One’s Got to Guess When Good Thing's Good" (Ot dobra dobra ne ishchut), has been in the works all through 1852. On October 6 that year Mikhail Pogodin wrote in his diary that he's heard the play in its author's rendition. On November 19 Ostrovsky informed Pogodin that the text had been sent to censors.
Ostrovsky staged the play for the first time himself in the house of his friend Nikolai Panov (the one who first started to collect Ostrovsky manuscripts which later continued to do Nikolai Shapovalo). Podkhalyuzin was played by the author himself and, reportedly, made even Prov Sadovsky laugh. Another 'underground' theater he found in the factory owned by Prince Yakov Gruzinsky (whose side-son Ivan Nikulin, an actor and a husband of Lyubov Kositskaya) in Pavlovsky Posad. 
Pogodin assisted with the play's promotion by approaching his old acquaintance, Stepan Gedeonov, the son of the director of Imperial theaters (who would later get his father's place and even write a play with Ostrovsky as a co-author). The play was declared eligible for production and in January 1853 Verstovsky assigned it to Lyubov Kositskaya's benefice. One of the latter's detractors was Countess Rostopchina who hated Kositskaya's simple ways and described her as "the creature very turnip-like with a heard like a water melon or a cabbage, ill-formed... She always comes across as a simpleton, with her silly smile. And what a vile, sloven diction!" All this, though, as biographer Lakshin noted, was exactly why the actress was admired by the majority of the Moscow theatre audience. 
Premiers.
The play was premiered in Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre on January 14, 1853 and had great success. It was received rapturously even by Ostrovsky's detractors like Vasily Botkin. The second and the third performances were even better, both Kositskaya and Sadovsky (as Rusakov) shone, and, as Lakshin put it, this was the birth of what was later termed as 'Ostrovsky's theater', the "union of the drama and the artists". The play that season was also shown 12 times in the Bolshoy.
In early February 1853 Ostrovsky went to Petersburg for the first time. Here he was received by Alexander Gedeonov, the director of Imperial theaters and became friends with actor Fyodor Burdin, not the most gifted but certainly one of the most intelligent and well-informed, and certainly the richest of his colleagues. It was Burdin who's earlier obtained the permission for "The Young Man’s Morning"’s production in the capital, which was premiered on February 12, 1853 in the Circus Theater. On February 19 "Stay in Your Own Sled" premiered in Alexandrinka Theatre. Again it was a success although the actors' work was less inspired and more formulaic than that of their Moscow colleagues. Ostrovsky had to leave the capital before the play's premiere after having received the news of his father's dying. Meanwhile, one of the shows in Alexandrinka was attended by Tsar Nikolai I himself who appeared to be greatly impressed, having construed the play's message as that "children should follow their parents' advices, otherwise, everything's ruined". Addressing to Gedeonov and his own entourage, he pronounced: "There's been not many plays which would have given me such pleasure. He added in French: "Се n'est phis une piece, c'est une lecon." Next evening he brought his whole family to the theater.
In March 1853 the play was published in March (No.5) issue of "Moskvityanin" and later that year came out as a separate edition. Several years later, formulating the play's idea, Nikolai Dobrolyubov wrote in "The Realm of Darkness" essay:

<doc id="36711996" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36711996" title="Retignano">
Retignano

Retignano is a village of about 400 inhabitants, located on a hill in the historical Versilia, a northern area of the Italian region of Tuscany, in the municipality of Stazzema, about 430 meters above sea level. The inhabitants are said "Retignanesi".
The maximum altitude is approximately 913 meters above sea level, on the tips of Montalto, where there are the remains of an ancient quarry of Ruby Red, a precious and very rare marble present only in a few areas, and places of extraction of bardiglio (a type of marble too).
It enjoys a mild climate thanks to the opening on the sea, although there are heavy snowfalls in winter (2009 and 2012 years are remembered by the inhabitants for the amount of about 30 cm of snow), and, thanks to its location on hills, from Retignano you can see the valley of Stazzema almost completely. You can also see Mount Pania, Corchia, Matanna, Mount Nona, Mount Procinto and all the adjoining mountains. For this reason it was the seat of local people forts which warned the villagers of the imminent dangerous attacks from the enemies on the coast.
A possible date of origins of the village dates back to late Roman times, during the wars with the Apuan Ligurians in the twenty years from 560 to 580 AD. Some studies have resulted that the name is probably a reference to "Retinio", a Roman who was entrusted with the district that eventually became "Ratiniana"', "Saint Peter's Retignano" and finally Retignano. During the 1100 was an independent municipality, headed by a mayor, and enjoyed a degree of prosperity that lasted until June 17, 1776, when the Grand Duke of Tuscany eliminated "comunelli" like this. The focus of activity shifted to Ruosina and then to Stazzema, the current headquarters of the "comune".
The church.
Some sources date the construction of the Saint Peter's Church in Retignano prior to the eighth century AD. Initially it was a small building with a facade facing the valley. On the left side was an entrance, later walled up, which today can still see some traces. During the 1200 and was extended toward the west.
From 1525 to 1530 was enlarged at the rear with the addition of an 'apse and circular single-light windows. In 1581 the roof, damaged, was repaired and the occasion was seized for restoring the rectory, the floor and the Tomb of the parish priests (1588).
Shortly before the unification of Italy 1861, the church of San Pietro was further 'modernized' by so doing they disappeared in a short time the last elements of considerable historical interest of the side facades. For lack of funds was not even possible to create a design architect" "' Andreotti' of Pietrasanta.
In 1902 was restored and the vestry were added in the fifties of the marble staircases and transferred some registers upstairs.
" At the beginning of the Third Millennium", the weather has damaged the single-light windows and interior walls.
The furniture and historical relics.
Among the objects of a certain value stands stoup goblet dating from the sixteenth century and attributed to the school Stagio Stagi of Pietrasanta. It 'about a hundred years before the processional cross made entirely of silver.
The Baptistery of" "' Vincent Tedeschi' by Seravezza, the baptismal font Sarzanese of John and Rose on the facade are all works dating from around 1562–1563.
Two Tabernacles, located in the side altars in the seventeenth century, were designed and built in 1480 by" 'Lawrence Stagi'" and his pupils, who ultimarono work in early 1500.
Above the tabernacle of the right was a small painting on canvas, dedicated to the Annunciation, and produced by Tommasi in 1734. In 1964 he was crowned with a crown of gold for the narrow escape from war. In 2009 the painting was stolen.
Inside the sacristy are preserved today as registers of marriages and baptisms for the dead, some of which date back to the late fifteenth century.
The cemetery.
In 1840 was started the project to build a cemetery. The upper floor was added in 1930 and adorned with special chapels and tombs. Fifty years later it was developed an upper floor of the cemetery.
In the initial period of construction, the project for the construction of the cemetery underwent several changes, especially due to the recent victims of epidemics. In the latter case, the entrance to the cemetery is still visible on a plaque which speaks of the epidemic of cholera that struck the country in 1857 and had some cases even in the years to follow, causing serious havoc among the inhabitants. Although today the plaque has been partially damaged by weather and half of it has fallen into disrepair due to a failure of the surrounding land, you can still read what is written there.
""When this district was invaded by the disease cholera, from September 5 to 15 October 45 corpses were buried in this land which then, as intended by that time all the burial of the dead, was conveniently enclosed by walls in 1857 and reduced to a regular graveyard, being the master Joseph Graziani the only performer of that work. peace to the souls of those who rest here, is the thought of death in the minds of those who still breathe the air of life ..." "
Monument to the Fallen.
To the left of the main entrance of the cemetery, there is an area dedicated to the fallen during the great wars of the twentieth century that marked deeply the country. The area consists of a commemorative walkway to the main monument, while around it stand of trees to symbolize the lives of the men started to fight and never returned. The monument, built in the decades to follow, he also wants to be a constant reminder of the atrocities of war, and a warning that similar events do not happen again. On the main facade has been engraved with a dove, symbol of peace, within whose wings are the words of comfort and an invitation to the brotherhood between peoples.
The bell.
The bell attached to the church dedicated to St. Peter's was built over the 17 years from 1599 in 1616. The bells that were included (still existing and working), date back to 1510 and another one in 1570–1571, although both were consecrated only in 1843.
On November 26, 1961 was added a third bell, blessed with" 'Bishop Hugh Camozzo'", the then Archbishop of Pisa. To follow the" Centenarian Celebration for the Unity of Italy," in 1964 Camozzo opened the cabinet, the bells that still syncs.
Demographic figures.
As you can see, the number of the inhabitants had rapidly decreased in the last 40 years due to the economical boom in the 1960s, which made most of the people move to the nearby cities, or because of the two worldwide conflicts, which caused a high number of deaths. Also, many Retignano inhabitants moved to the United States or managed to reach South America, especially Argentina.
Third Millennium Retignano.
In the village there are two associations that meet citizenship: the centennial of Retignano Mercy, founded in 1908, and C.R.S. (which stands for Circolo Ricreativo Sportivo and can be translated in "Sports Recreational Club"), founded originally as "C.R. Operaio" (C. R. Worker). In 2001 following the merger with Polisportiva Retignano took its current name, its own representative in the football league is a militant FIGC third category, after a season in the second. In all, the country team has won as many as 9 tournaments, earning nine stars on the coat (a cat in the foreground on a white-blue).
Local people organize regular village events of a certain social, religious and tourist importance, such as festivals on the occasion of Saint Peter's celebrating day, processions, illuminations of Jesus' Dead, which always attract hundreds of people, small exhibitions, dancing in the streets.
The country is home to the Alta Versilia Football Tournament, a challenge involving long formations of the countries of Stazzemese to win the" 'Trophy Barsottini'", a special cup in honour of a great male player died a long time ago.
Finally, in summer, on June, the 29th (the feast of the saint patron of the country) is organized a festival, called "Sagra del Tordello" ("Tordello Feast"), usually lasting three or four days. The event is sometimes repeated in mid-July and attracts many people, especially for the quiet, relaxing atmosphere of the mountains at night.
Since 1953 in the village it's active a Weather Station, which provides statistics for the entire municipality of Stazzema. Even if that meteorological station is not advanced, it keeps providing data to servers just like it has just been installed.
In 2006 they ultimated the reconstruction of the older school building, turned into a restaurant and nearby into the headquarters of CERAFRI, which is a center for the monitoring of the hydrological risk of Versilia arose after the needs that emerged as a result of flood in 1996.
In 2009 the theft of the famous shrine of the Immaculate Conception framework has caused great distress in the country, even the dismay of the priest. During the rule of the Germans in World War II in Versilia, the villagers had turned to that framework Retignano was spared from destruction and displacement. After some hours, some still-unknown soldiers brought the news about the countermand.
In 2013 summer, Retignano held the 1st Trofeo San Pietro, which consists in a competitive race and in a non-competitive one, with special tracks for children. The paths were spread all over the village with different difficulties depending on the type of race choice.
From Retignano you can take a hike up to Mont'Alto and access the "Scalette" ("Ladders").

Trionyx messelianus

Trionyx messelianus is an extinct species of softshell turtle belonging to the family Trionychidae. These turtles lived in the Middle Eocene. Whether the various specimen found at the Messel Pit Fossil Site can be classified within the genus Trionyx is uncertain. Some authors believe that "Trionyx messelianus" from Messel should be considered synonym of "Rafetoides austriacus" (Peters, 1858), see Karl (1998).
Description.
Trionyx messelianus is a three-clawed soft-shell turtle that can reach a length of about two feet. It is the largest species of turtles of Messel Pit Fossil Site. The carapace and plastron are not connected by bony prominences and the plastron shows bony plates reduced to small protrusions.

Twin Lakes Dam

Twin Lakes Dam (National ID # CO02045) is a dam in Lake County, Colorado, about 13 miles south of Leadville.
The earthen dam was constructed in 1978 by the United States Bureau of Reclamation with a height of 53 feet and a length at its crest of 3150 feet. The dam is owned and operated by the Bureau as one element of its larger "transbasin" Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, which transfers available water from Colorado's West Slope across the Continental Divide to the more arid, and more populated, East Slope. 
The reservoir it creates, Twin Lakes, is an enlargement of a natural glacial lake. It has a surface area of 2700 acres and a maximum capacity of 141,000 acre-feet.

Gérard Caron

Gérard Caron (born August 30, 1938) is a French designer. He was the co-founder of Carré Noir, the very first French design marketing agency, making him one of the inventors of the concept of brand design in France. He also contributed to the development of French design marketing overseas, in Japan as well as in other countries around the world.
Gérard Caron, who is the author of several books on design as a professional activity, and the creator of a website dedicated to design, regularly gives lectures on this topic.
Early life and education.
Gérard Caron was born in Pont l'Evêque, Normandy, France, into a family of seven children, just before the outbreak of the Second World War. Nothing in his family background (his father was a telephone inspector and his mother a seamstress) seemed to destine him for a career in design. In the long periods of shortages brought about by the war, Gérard Caron invented games, made products using flour, potatoes, sugar, water, or cider as his basic ingredients, created makeshift packaging and dreamt up advertising slogans and sold them to his brothers and sisters. Without realizing it, he had started creating his first packaging materials and logos. Gérard Caron was twenty when war was declared in Algeria. For twenty-eight months, he did his military service in the Engineers where he happened to read an article about jobs in advertising. It came as a revelation. With his heart set on working in this industry, he decided to take correspondence courses. When he was demobilized, he continued studying at the Ecole Supérieure de la Communication in Paris from which he graduated top of his class. To pay for his studies, he worked simultaneously in a bank. Later on, he would also study distribution, graphology, and psychology.
Career.
Caron began his long life in advertising with Publicis in 1962, where he acquired his first professional experience. He developed his career working successively for SNIP (which subsequently became BDDP), Young & Rubicam, and Ted Bates. He spent considerable time in companies such as Brandt and Cotelle Lesieur, where he worked on the celebrated plastic Lacroix bleach bottle in 1964 with Raymond Loewy. This was his first professional contact with design and was to have an immense influence on his subsequent career. Later on, Gérard Caron studied and developed theories about design based on handwriting, heraldry, symbolism, and relaxation therapy with his partner Michel Disle.
In 1973, he founded Carré Noir, la première agence de design-marketing en France, the first design marketing agency to be set up in France, with three professionals from the Ted Bates agency: the architect Michel Alizard, the artistic director Michel Disle, and the designer Jean Perret. The square of the logo symbolizes the friendship of the four partners and the black color represents the pencil stroke of the creative designer on the sheet of white paper. They decided to call their new business a “design agency”. At that time, the word ‘design’ conjured up images of Scandinavian furniture and had not yet become part of the advertising lexicon. Gérard Caron and his associates are considered to be the inventors of communication design in France.
Gérard Caron went on to set up subsidiaries of Carré Noir around the world, in the United States, Japan, Italy, Belgium and England. He also prepared the launch of the agency in Germany, Poland and Hong Kong before leaving the business in 1998.
In all, Gérard Caron has created nearly 13,000 packaging designs with his teams (for brands such as Carrefour, Biotherm, Lancôme, etc.), 1,200 visual identities (including logos for Lotus, Le Bon Marché or the RPR political party and the emblem used by former French president François Mitterrand) and 90 new chain store concepts (for Yves Rocher, Loisirs & Création or Auchan).
The career pursued by Caron and his extensive research on symbolic systems, colours, and the memorization of signs led him to work with artists, scientists, psychiatrists, business leaders, and politicians and to write a large number of books in which he develops his thoughts about design. In 2003, he founded and became editor of Admirable Design, a weekly online magazine devoted to news about design and related markets. Today, Gérard Caron shares his knowledge and expertise in France and around the world as a consultant for design agencies and business organizations, and gives many lectures in Japan and throughout Europe.
Key dates.

Peak Aerospace Me 109

The Peak Aerospace Me 109R is a family of German replica warbird ultralight aircraft that was designed by Tassilo Bek, and originally produced by Peak Aerospace, Mecklenburger Ultraleicht Flugzeugbau Christian Engelen and now produced by Classic Planes GmbH of Pasewalk. The design was first flown in 1991. The aircraft is an 80% scale replica of the Second World War Messerschmitt Bf 109 and is supplied as a kit for amateur construction or as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.
Design and development.
The aircraft was designed to comply with the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight rules. It features a cantilever low-wing, a single-seat enclosed cockpit, retractable conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.
The first replica was inspired by Bek's inspection of a Loehle 5151 Mustang scale replica fighter at AirVenture in the late 1980s. He was impressed with the scale warbird, but wanted a German aircraft and so returned home and set out to design an Me 109 replica.
The first prototype, registered D-MBAK, was of all wooden construction, powered by a Hirth 2704 producing only and first flew in 1991. This aircraft achieved on its low power output, but Bek started a second prototype based on lessons learned in 1992. The second aircraft, registered D-MYBB, first flew in 1992, but was lost in an accident that same year. Bek's third prototype, D-MNBP, was flown in about 1994 and resulted in some kits being sold.
Bek flew a homebuilt category version of the Me 109 in 1996, powered by a Hirth F30 and later a Subaru automotive conversion, which became the prototype of the Me 109R kit aircraft. Bek then sold the company and the new owner ceased development of the Me 109. In 2003 Christian Engelen purchased the project and continued work on the aircraft, officially re-launching it in 2004. Since then production has continued on a demand basis.
The current production version, the Me 109R is made from composites. Its span wing has an area of and flaps. Standard engines available include the Rotax 582 two-stroke, the Weber Motor MPE 750 and the D-Motor LF26 four-stroke powerplants.

History.
In 1999, the Minerva School in Basel opened up a bilingual branch, which subsequently became the SIS Swiss International School. The pioneering class of SIS Basel consisted of four students. Shortly thereafter, the first bilingual institutes in Zurich and Winterthur were founded, and in 2008, SIS Stuttgart-Fellbach opened as SIS’ first school in Germany.

Sarasota Thunder

The Sarasota Thunder were a professional indoor football team based in Sarasota, Florida. They played in the Ultimate Indoor Football League (UIFL) for part of the 2013 season before folding. The Thunder initially announced Robarts Arena as their home venue, though they played all their games on the road.
Franchise history.
In August 2012, the Sarasota Thunder were announced as the third 2013 expansion team of the Ultimate Indoor Football League. This was the second attempt to bring an indoor football team to Sarasota, the first being the Florida Scorpions of the National Indoor Football League. The team announced they would play their home games in Robarts Arena. In September 2012, the Thunder named Greg Walls the franchise's first head coach.
Before the season, however, the league took over control of the Thunder and shifted them to an all-travel schedule, with no home games in Sarasota. The team played very poorly, generally losing in blowouts. Their performance caused disruption through the league, as their host teams had difficulty drawing fans to such lopsided games. On May 9, the Florida Tarpons – whose owners also owned the UIFL – announced the Thunder had forfeited a scheduled game against them; the league subsequently folded the team.

<doc id="36712146" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36712146" title="The Ignerents">
The Ignerents

The Ignerents were formed in 1977 in Whitstable, Kent, by brothers Chris and Steve Harris, joined by neighbour Mark Leighton on guitar, vocalist Kevin Holmes and drummer Stan 'Gretsch' Littlejohn. The band were an important part of the local Kent punk scene in the late seventies in Kent alongside bands like Wild Billy Childish's Pop Rivets, The Names, Naughty Thoughts and The Rivals (see http://www.boredteenagers.co.uk/RIVALS1.htm)
All of the band went to Queen Elizabeth's School in Faversham. The band were managed by a third Harris brother, Phil, who was quick to recruit Ben Challis from another local punk band, The Plague, when Kevin Holmes dropped out as lead singer just before the band's first gig in Whitstable. In its final and most successful lineup (as the Ignerents), the band was a fourpiece consisting of Ben Challis (vocals), Steve Harris (guitar), Chris Harris (base) and Stan Gretsch (drums). The band released one single in 1979 ("Radio Interference" b/w "Wrong Place Wrong Time"). The Ignerents also featured on the First Offenders compilation album in 1980 with two tracks, "Harbour Street" and "I Won't Be There". "Wrong Place Wrong Time" also featured on the German Punk series 'Back To Front'. The band finally evolved into a new band, The Beekeepers, which featured Nick Appleton on guitar alongside Steve and with Chris, Ben and Stan, and then finally with Russel Lax on drums (who, in the then small Kent new wave music scene had, I think, been the Pop Rivets' drummer and ended up as the drummer with local folk hereoes the Oysterband!). The Beekeepers released one single, "Platform 5" b/w "The Trouble With You" in 1981.
On the live circuit the Ignerents were active from 1977-1981 with numerous gigs that included the Marquee Club and the Vortex in London and support slots with bands like 999, The Only Ones, Wayne County & The Electric Chairs and Chelsea.
The band's history has been marred by two tragic deaths: firstly, Stan, by now drummer with the Rivals, died in a road accident in 1981 and then in 1994 Chris died in a drowning accident whilst on holiday. Both are still much missed. The band released the Beekeepers single to celebrate Stan's life and played a final tribute gig to celebrate Chris's life at the Tankerton Arms in Whitstable in 1994 and in 1997 released a CD ("Woodbines, Tears and Jealousy") which featured all of the Ignerents' previously released tracks and another ten archive tracks.
Various tracks also feature on other compilation albums (see the Discography) including "Wrong Place Wrong Time" on Back To Front Vol 4 and "Call me Irresponsible" on Punks, Skins & Rude Boys III.

Background.
In an interview with Digital Spy he said: "The making of this album for me has probably been the most refreshing, mainly because I wasn't trying to record an album, so to speak. I thought I'd take some time off, write some songs for a bit, go and hang in LA for a bit. The album kind of evolved, and I thought, 'You know what, these songs are good'. It's fairly musical. There's nothing really generic about this album, in that when I say generic I mean it's not typically RnB or typically soul or typically pop, it's got different elements from the three. It's quite live, it's got live sounding drums and like I said, guitars and piano. It's pop songs but the lyrics are a bit deeper. It's an album that I think in moments will make you think."

Coma (U.S. miniseries)

Coma is an American television mini-series based on the 1977 novel "Coma" by Robin Cook and the subsequent 1978 film "Coma". The four-hour medical thriller was originally broadcast on A&E on September 3–4, 2012.
The series was directed by Mikael Salomon and produced by Ridley Scott and his brother Tony Scott, the same group who had adapted "The Andromeda Strain" as a mini-series for A&E in 2008. The film is dedicated to Tony Scott, who died in August 2012, only weeks before its broadcast premiere.
Plot.
Susan Wheeler (Lauren Ambrose) is a medical student starting her first year of training at the Peach Tree Memorial Hospital, built by her deceased grandfather. There she meets Dr. Mark Bellows (Steven Pasquale), Chief Surgical Resident, a doctor in a relationship with the Head of Psychiatry Dr. Agnetta Lindquist (Geena Davis). Wheeler discovers that an unusually high number of surgeries at the hospital have been ending in comas. These coma patients are being transferred to the mysterious Jefferson Institute, a hospital designed to take care of coma patients. It is run by Mrs. Emerson (Ellen Burstyn), who refers to the patients as her "babies". With the help of Dr. Bellows (and soon Dr. Theodore Stark (James Woods), Chief of Surgery), Wheeler investigates the comas, and before long, strange things begin to happen seemingly to stop her investigation: her roommate, who works at the hospital and who helped her to access confidential files, is suddenly fired; the hospital board tries to have her expelled from school; and she discovers cameras in her house. She is also stalked by Peter Arno (Michael Weston), who turns out to be a patient of Dr. Lindquist's and seems to be stalking Wheeler at Lindquist's behest. During one encounter with Wheeler, Peter puts a burlap sack over her head and tells her that if she does not stop looking into the comas, she will end up at Jefferson too.
Soon after a rare tour at the Jefferson, during which Wheeler wanders off path and discovers inhumane practices such as suspending patients by metal rods inserted into their bones, she contacts Dr. Stark with evidence, but he is in a car accident that renders him comatose before he can expose the conspiracy. Wheeler and Dr. Bellows, who began suspecting Dr. Lindquist's role in the conspiracy and broke off their relationship, together find out that various hospital staff and doctors have been getting large amounts of money from Jefferson. They further discover that each patient who ended up in a coma was operated on in the same room, which was pumped full of carbon monoxide via a pipe from the basement; this would render the patient brain dead without anyone noticing. Arno tries to kill Wheeler as she tries to collect evidence, but when he fails, he slits his own throat in a body cooler.
Wheeler is eventually captured and delivered to Jefferson, where they plan to put her into a coma. She breaks free, though severely sedated, and tries to escape through the hospital, hallucinating that she is underwater. As she flees, she finds out the complete truth - the Jefferson Institute is a human experimentation laboratory and organ farm. Jefferson has Peach Tree Memorial purposely induce comas on patients predisposed to certain diseases and then uses the bodies in various ways, ranging from harvesting organs from the patients directly to inducing pregnancy to use the fetuses for parts or umbilical stem cells to using them as human test subjects. Finally she encounters Professor Hillside, her medical school professor, who tells her that he and her late grandfather, Dr. Wheeler, are the masterminds of the Jefferson Institute, making it their legacy. Wheeler cries, distraught that this barbarism is being carried out in the name of medical advancement. 
Meanwhile, Dr. Bellows and police Detective Jackson (who has been investigating the stalking of Wheeler and the death of Arno) both end up at the house of Dr. Stark. There they find most of the doctors gathered for Dr. Stark's memorial; Stark died during surgery a few hours before. While there, Dr. Nelson, head of anesthesiology and a part of the conspiracy, is seemingly overcome by guilt and tells the detective and Dr. Bellows that they can find Wheeler at the Jefferson Institute. The police and Dr. Bellows soon enter the institute and witness the horror for themselves. They arrest Professor Hillside and Dr. Bellows discovers Wheeler, who stabbed Mrs. Emerson to death with a syringe in self-defense and escaped through a drain.
The mini-series ends with Wheeler awake in a hospital with Dr. Bellows by her side. She tells him she had “a terrible dream...I dreamt I was underwater and I couldn't get out”. Dr. Bellows tells her “it was just a dream” and then receives a text message with a picture of Dr. Lindquist, asking him to join her at a hospital in China. Dr. Bellows looks at Susan and repeats, “It was just a dream.”

Verne Gay of "Newsday" also gave it a B and stated, "The plot's ridiculous, but the film's mostly fun, while the pleasure of watching Ellen Burstyn play a homicidal wacko is not to be denied anyone." David Hinckley of the "New York Daily News" stated, "This "Coma" is different enough from the 1978 movie to have its own appeal, and the cast keeps things interesting even during plot lulls." Linda Stasi of the "New York Post" called the mini-series "very lame" and "dopey", adding, "The mystery is pretty much laid out like a coma patient from the beginning ruins whatever suspense you might otherwise have built up."

<doc id="36712322" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36712322" title="Environmental policy of the European Union">
Environmental policy of the European Union

The European Union (EU) is considered by some to have the most extensive environmental laws of any international organisation. Its environmental policy is significantly intertwined with other international and national environmental policies. The environmental legislation of the European Union also has significant effects on those of its member states. The European Union’s environmental legislation addresses issues such as acid rain, the thinning of the ozone layer, air quality, noise pollution, waste and water pollution. The Institute for European Environmental Policy estimates the body of EU environmental law amounts to well over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions.
The beginnings of the EU's environmental policy.
The Paris Summit meeting of heads of state and government of the European Economic Community (EEC) in October 1972 is often used to pin point the beginning of the EU's environmental policy. A declaration on environmental and consumer policy was adopted at this summit which requested the European Commission to draw up an action programme for environmental protection. This (first) Environmental Action Programme was adopted in July 1973 and represented the EU’s first environmental policy. Furthermore, the task force within the Commission that drew up this action programme eventually led to the formation of a Directorate General for the Environment.
The primary reason at that time for the introduction of a common environmental policy was the concern that diverse environmental standards could result in trade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market. Different national standards for particular products, such as limitations on vehicle emissions for the lead content of petrol, posed significant barriers to the free trade of these products within the Economic Community (EC). An additional motivation driving the EU’s emerging environmental policy was the increasing international politicisation of environmental problems and the growing realisation from the beginning of the 1970s that environmental pollution did not stop at national borders, but had to be addressed by cross-border measures.
At that time there was no mention of environmental policy in the founding treaties of the EU and therefore no explicit Treaty basis which underpinned EU environmental policy. However, the Treaty text was interpreted dynamically enabling environmental policy to be regarded as an essential goal of the Community, even though it was not explicitly mentioned. It was not until the middle of the 1980s and the signing of the Single European Act in 1986 that economic and ecological objectives were put on a more equal footing within the Community.
Main actors.
EU environmental policy is shaped by a variety of actors including all of the main EU institutions as well as lobby groups which makeup the wider Brussels policy making community.
Member states shape EU environmental policy by working within the Council of Ministers. The Council is a central actor in decision making in the EU sharing its decision making power with the European Parliament under the ‘ordinary legislative procedure’. There are different Council formations (made up of ministers responsible for particular policy areas) one of which is the Environment Council. The number of Environment Council meetings has increased significantly over time. Heads of state meet in something different – the European Council – which until recently had very little to do with environmental policy. However, more recently the European Council has played an important role in EU climate change policy in particular.
The European Commission not only has an exclusive right to propose new environmental policy, but it also has a responsibility to ensure the implementation of environmental rules. Therefore, since its creation in the 1950s the European Commission has been at the heart of the European Union. However, it did not set up a unit dedicated to environmental issues until the 1970s and a full Directorate General for the environment until 1981. Initially DG Environment was perceived as a relatively weak DG but it has gradually become more assertive through the development of technical and political expertise. However, the Commission still has to depend on member states to implement its policies.
Traditionally, the European Parliament gained a reputation as a champion of environmental interests within the EU where it provided an access point for those excluded from decision making and a voice for green political parties. However, it was a reactive and relatively weak institution. More recently the Parliament has benefited from treaty changes that have made it a co-legislator with the Council of Ministers. However, the empowerment of the Parliament seems to have reduced its green credentials as it now appears less willing to adopt green amendments.
Over the last 40 years the EU has attracted the interest of a vast number of lobby groups including environmental NGOs. As early as 1974, environmental groups from all the member states established a central representation in Brussels, founding the European Environmental Bureau. Other environmental NGOs only set up shop in Brussels from the late 1980s onwards. European institutions, especially the European Commission, provide relatively easy access to these groups compared to some national governments. The European Commission has even actively encouraged their participation in policy making by setting up consultative committees and other bodies, and providing funds to establish and maintain certain core groups.
Policy processes.
Policy making in the EU can be extremely complex; much more so than that at the national level. It has been suggested that the policy making process is too densely populated with veto players (i.e. actors whose agreement is necessary for a policy to be adopted) for any single actor or group of actors (including the EU’s member states) to consistently control the direction of policy making. The result in environmental policy making has been widely depicted as being especially unpredictable, unstable and at times even chaotic. However, the European Commission, as a key player in the policy making process, has under pressure to develop ‘standard operating procedures’ for processing policy. This has led to a number of changes in policy making processes in recent years, including: adopting minimum standards of consultation; the impact assessment of all major policy proposals; and the earlier publication of its work programmes.
The focus of EU environmental policy making has also changed in recent years concentrating more on updating existing policies than on building-up the EU’s role in environmental policy. In the 1970s and 1980s EU environmental policy was marked by the rapid build-up of a body of legislation that covered a range of issues previously not dealt with at EU level. Since the 1980s, other new issues have been taken up but in addition an increasing proportion of the environmental agenda has been taken up by debates on the revision of existing legislation. As a result, the proportion of EU environmental legislation that amends previous laws has steadily increased over time. Consequently, for most environmental issues, the key question is no longer: ‘should the EU be involved?’ but ‘what should the EU be doing?’ And the logic for getting the issue on the EU political agenda is no longer to make the EU take it up but to change existing policies (strengthening or weakening them, depending on a political actor’s objectives). This change in both the stakes of and the key struggle in agenda setting strategies, marks a shift from ‘new issues’ to ‘ongoing or recurring concerns’.
In its policy making processes the EU has made a sizeable effort to undertake a particular type of policy coordination, namely the integration of environmental considerations into the operation of all policy sectors. The potential of environmental policy integration is undoubtedly ambitious: economically powerful sectors such as agriculture, energy and transport should ‘design out’ environmental problems in the development of their own policies. However, it has proven much harder to implement than many had originally expected, not least those working in the European Commission’s environment directorate-general. A significant causal factor here has been the EU’s fragmented institutional and political structure, which on the one hand has facilitated the adoption of visionary policy objectives, but has also undermined their implementation.
Implementation is very much at the ‘sharp end’ of the EU policy process. The success of EU policies – and with them the whole integration project – are often judged by the impacts they have on the ground. If, however, the acquis (the body of EU law) is not fully implemented, EU policies risk becoming paper exercises with little tangible effect on environmental quality but serious distorting impacts on the Single Market. The implementation of policy in the EU is widely regarded as being problematic. Yet, both public and academic understanding of this crucial stage of the EU policy process remains relatively limited. Indeed for a long time, a number of factors kept the whole issue of poor implementation down or off the political agenda, but today it is much more politicised, pushed along by the campaigning activities of NGOs and pro-integration actors such as the European Parliament. A whole host of solutions to the EU’s implementation problems have been offered, some of which could, if deployed, even compound the problem. But in many respects, the causes of poor (or at least imperfect) implementation reside in the very structure of the EU. Consequently, there are likely to be no panaceas.
To develop new environmental policies, it is important first to evaluate those that have already been adopted. However, this intuitively simple idea is difficult to apply in practice, no more so than in the EU where the complex system of multi-level governance adds considerably to the practical difficulty of evaluating policies. Assessing impacts and finding side-effects of policies is best achieved by a plurality of data, methods, analysts and theories, as well as evaluation criteria. In recent years the demand for evaluations of EU policies and programmes has increased as the importance of evaluation has become more widely recognised. Many actors have become involved in commissioning, producing and using evaluations (including the European Environment Agency), but the role of evaluation is often still quite weak.
The EU as a global environmental actor.
The EU is an important – even an ‘influential’ – actor in international environmental negotiations. Therefore, if one wants to understand the processes and outcomes of international environmental negotiations, one needs to be familiar with the role that the EU plays there. Also, developments at the international level have an influence on the EU, its policies and the extent to which it can be a global actor. Hence, European and international environmental politics and policies are constantly interacting and thus mutually constitutive. 
The EU is a party to all major Multi-lateral Environmental Agreements covering a whole variety of environmental issues. The EU is also able to fully participate in international environmental negotiations, either as an observer in the UN context or as a party to the mother treaty in various Conference of the Parties (COPs) and Meeting of the Parties (MOPs). The EU is often observed as a leader in global environmental politics, but its leadership role can nowadays also be questioned, especially in the area of climate change. The EU’s international climate change policy consists of three building blocks (environmental integrity, multilateralism, a legally binding instrument), which are under pressure in the context of the current climate change negotiations. As in other areas of external action, the EU’s external environmental policy is often characterised by a mismatch between its ambitions and its ability to deliver in practice.
Sustainable development.
When the EEC was established, environmental protection, let alone the broader concept of sustainable development, was not perceived as an important policy issue. The concept of sustainable development contains environmental, social and economic dimensions; finding practical ways to balance the three is widely regarded as a key challenge. The EU policies in the field of sustainable development evolved as a result of the interaction between internal political drivers and the EU’s response to a number of key UN conferences. One such influential conference was the first UN Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in 1972. This not only addressed the environmental concerns of the industrialised countries in the North, but also, the development concerns of countries in the South. Sustainable development was only mentioned in European Council Conclusions for the first time in 1988. Wavering political support for ‘sustained growth’ and/or ‘sustainable development’ continued for some years and reveals just how ambivalent attitudes were to the concept. The 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam eventually ensured the formal recognition of sustainable development as a legal objective under the Treaties. Subsequently, the EU’s commitment to sustainable development was formalised as one of the EU's fundamental goals. 
In 1997, the EU committed itself to draw up a ‘national’ strategy for sustainable development by 2002. The Commission published a Communication on a European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development in 2001 which was discussed at the Göteborg European Council. However, this strategy suffered from several governance weaknesses which inhibited its implementation. In particular, the Strategy has been heavily affected by its ambiguous relationship to the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs, which has received far higher political priority. 
The political and institutional crisis that faced the EU in 2005 after the rejection of the EU Constitution, pushed the Sustainable Development Strategy back up the political agenda. A ‘renewed’ SDS was subsequently adopted by the EU Council in 2006. The renewed strategy contained more detailed arrangements for implementation, monitoring and follow-up.
The legal formalisation of the EU’s commitment to sustainable development as a policy objective was completed by the Lisbon Treaty.
Sustainable development is now repeatedly mentioned in the Treaties: as a basic objective of the EU in the new Article 3 TEU; in Article 21 TEU concerning the external action of the Union; and in Article 11 TFEU setting out the integration principle. The EU is now legally committed to pursue sustainable development both internally and externally (i.e. in its relations with ‘the wider world’). 
The post 2008 economic crisis has led to a marked decline in high-level policy interest in long-term policy objectives such as sustainable development. A new ‘Europe 2020’ strategy replaced the Lisbon Strategy in 2010; it reduced the environmental dimension to energy and resource efficiency. The words ‘sustainable development’ are not even mentioned. The future of the EU’s sustainable development policies is uncertain and it is possible that the EU will return once again to a narrower focus on environmental policy.
Major areas of environmental policy.
The Water Framework Directive is an example of a water policy, aiming for rivers, lakes, ground and coastal waters to be of "good quality" by 2015. The Birds Directive established as early as 1979 and the Habitats Directive are pieces of European Union legislation for protection of biodiversity and natural habitats. These protections however only directly cover animals and plants; fungi and micro-organisms have no protection under European Union law. The directives are implemented through the Natura 2000 programme and covers 30,000 sites throughout Europe.

In the late 90s of the twentieth century, the food retailer company Casino Group delegated the management of their retailer properties in a new subsidiary, Groupe Casino Immobilière.

North Little Rock High School

North Little Rock High School is a public school in North Little Rock, Arkansas, which is administered by the North Little Rock School District. As of the 2012–13 school year, the high school consists of three campuses: Freshman Campus (grade 9, formerly East Campus), Sophomore Campus (grade 10, formerly Poplar Street Middle School), and West Campus (grades 11-12).
History.
Built in 1890, North Little Rock's (Argenta's) first high school was called North Side High School, later Clendenin Hill High School (site of present day Argenta Alternative Academy at 13th & Main Streets).
In 1912, Argenta High School was constructed at 4th and Willow Streets. The rapid northward growth of North Little Rock in the mid-1920s resulted in a doubling of school enrollment. In 1928 as the need for a new high school increased, the North Little Rock School Board selected the corner of 22nd and Main Streets as the new construction site for North Little Rock High School. As a result, North Side High School became a junior high school.
The North Little Rock High School was constructed beginning in 1928 and completed in 1930. Little Rock architect George R. Mann of the firm Peterson, William, Mann, Wanger & King designed the high school as a light colored brick and concrete building in an Art-Deco style. Also in 1928, an annex was constructed and the former Hickory Street School (originally Argenta Black School) was renamed as Scipio A. Jones High School, an African-American school named after the prominent civil rights activist and lawyer, starts teaching students through graduation. Between 1956 and 1959, North Little Rock High School served students in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade for nearby City of Sherwood before the construction of Sylvan Hills High School was completed.
In 1970, the North Little Rock School District closed Jones Junior-Senior High School as a result of desegregation and the city established a new integrated public high school and thus integrated and renamed the then 40-year old classic art-deco facility along Main Street as Ole Main High School and named the new facility as Northeast High School. For the next twenty years, the Northeast Chargers served as a natural rival for the Ole Main Wildcats. Then in 1990, the school district consolidated the two schools as North Little Rock High School East Campus (formerly Northeast) for ninth and tenth grades and North Little Rock High School West Campus (formerly Ole Main) for eleventh and twelfth grades. As a result of the consolidation, the schools' new mascot became the "Charging Wildcats" as it remains today. In 1993, North Little Rock High School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 2012, the city of North Little Rock passed a millage to integrate the school into one campus for all high schoolers, grades 9-12. Construction for the new building and demolition of old ones began the following school year. The district had to shuffle grades to different campuses to allow for it. The new high school is predicted to be functioning in the 2015 - 2016 school year.
Curriculum.
The school's assumed course of study is based on the Smart Core curriculum developed by the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE). The school offers coursework and exams in Advanced Placement (AP) and since 1992 offers the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme. Additionally, the school is a member of the EAST (Environmental And Spacial Technologies) Initiative that allows students to familiaze themselves with technology through partnerships with technology firms.
The school has a history of outstanding educators including the 1982, 1990, and 1997 Arkansas Teacher of the Year awardees honored by the ADE and the 1979 and 1987 Bandmaster of the Year award by the Arkansas School Band and Orchestra Association (ASBOA)
Extracurricular activities.
The school's mascot and athletic emblem is the "Charging Wildcat" with royal blue and gold serving as the school colors.
Athletics.
For 2012–14, the Charging Wildcats participate in numerous interscholastic sports and events from the 7A Classification—the state's largest classification—within the 7A Central Conference administered by the Arkansas Activities Association including: baseball, basketball (boys/girls), bowling (boys/girls), cheer (boys/girls), cross country (boys/girls), dance, debate, football, golf (boys/girls), soccer (boys/girls), softball, speech, swimming (boys/girls), tennis (boys/girls), track (boys/girls), volleyball and wrestling.
Awards and recognition.
The girl's softball team from 2001 to 2003 hold a state record 41 consecutive wins with a state record of 34 wins during the 2002 season. Playing for Scipio A. Jones High School, Eddie Miles averaged 30.3 points per game during his senior year and led the Golden Dragons to four consecutive black school state championships. Between 1987-1990, Paula Juels won four consecutive individual state tennis championships (state record) while leading the North Little Rock Northeast Chargers to three team championships.
Clubs and traditions.
Beyond athletic completion, students are provided opportunities to participate in programs such as National Honor Society, National Beta Club, Junior Rotarian program, Arkansas Governor's School, Unitown, Tri-M Music Honor Society, Teachers of Tomorrow, Key Club, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), National Forensic League Arkansas District, Ladies & Gentlemen Club, VICA, Interact Club, Mu Alpha Theta, Health Occupations Students of America, and Student Council.
Awards and recognition.
In 1988, the school's yearbook "The Wildcat" was inducted in the National Scholastic Press Association (NSPA) All-American Hall of Fame for its numerous National Pacemaker Awards it had received in previous years. In 2002, the school's literary magazine "Legend" grabbed a NSPA Best of Show Award.

<doc id="36712457" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36712457" title="Prince Heinrich XXXIII Reuss of Köstritz">
Prince Heinrich XXXIII Reuss of Köstritz

Prince Heinrich XXXIII Reuss of Köstritz (26 July 1879 – 15 November 1942) was the son of Prince Heinrich VII Reuss of Köstritz and his wife Princess Marie Alexandrine of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.
Family and early life.
Prince Heinrich XXXIII Reuss was the son of the Prince Heinrich VII Reuss of Köstritz and Princess Marie Alexandrine of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Through his mother, Prince Heinrich XXXIII was heir to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands until the birth of the Crown Princess Juliana, daughter of Queen Wilhelmina.
Prince Reuss was trained as a doctor, and passed all his medical examinations; he entered the army subsequently and took a commission in the 2nd Dragoon Guards, and afterwards served in the diplomatic service. It was Prince Reuss before whom the two English doctors, Dr. Elliot and Dr. Austin, who were arrested as spies in Belgium when tried. The question to be decided by the Prince was whether they were doctors or not, and he had to put them through a severe examination in medicine. They were acquitted, and the Prince reportedly said "he thought those two English doctors two of the finest and most honest men he had ever met."
Dutch succession.
Prince Heinrich XXXIII Reuss. He was seen as the most probable heir to the Dutch throne in case Queen Wilhelmina would remain childless. So up until 1909 he could be considered as an heir although he had severe competition from the Wied family (Princess Marie of Wied was a daughter of Prince Frederick of the Netherlands and she was very popular in the Netherlands). Prince Heinrich XXXIII was the younger son of Marie Alexandrine (daughter of Princess Sophie of the Netherlands) and Prince Heinrich VII Reuss of Köstritz. The firstborn son, prince Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss of Köstritz was not considered seriously as a candidate for the Dutch throne. He was supposedly ugly and not very intelligent.
Prince Henry XXXII of Reuss, who is next in order to the Grand Duke of Saxe- Weimar, is said to have no ambition in the direction of the Dutch throne, and to be willing to "renounce" in favour of Prince Henry XXXIII, now employed at the Berlin foreign Office, and until a year ago a member of the German Embassy in Paris. Early last year Prince Henry XXXIII was the guest of the Queen at The Hague, and was made much of at the Court and in social circles, so that he came to be generally regarded as "first favourite" in the succession. He is a man of varied talents; as a sculptor and as a painter he has produced ivories which have been accorded favourable criticism.
Marriage.
He married, firstly, Princess Victoria Margaret of Prussia, daughter of Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia and Princess Louise Sophie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, on 17 May 1913 at Neues Palais, Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany. He and Viktoria Margarete Elisabeth Marie Ulrike Prinzessin von Preußen were divorced on 14 July 1922. 
The courtship between the Princess Margarethe and the Prince was conducted under difficulties. Both the Prince and Princess Leopold (her parents) objected very strongly to Prince Reuss. In the first place, they did not regard his rank as at all equal to their own, and they expected their daughter would make a better match; but I think they also disliked him because they saw that the Princess was really fond of him. It was just in accordance with the character and disposition of the Prince and Princess Leopold that they should dislike the Prince for this reason. When the Prince came to Potsdam to see the Princess he found great difficulty in doing so. He was not asked to stay at Klein Glienicke. He stayed with the Prince zu Wied, and came over to Klein Glienicke occasionally, but was given very little encouragement to come there, especially by the Prince Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia. When the Princess Leopold asked Prince Reuss to dinner, Prince Leopold refused to meet him, and the dinner had to be served in the private rooms of the Princess Margarethe. When the Princess Leopold was unable to be present at dinner, as happened on one or two occasions, the Princess was chaperoned by Fräulein von Stromberg. I doubt if the marriage would ever have come off only for the fact that the Kaiser liked Prince Reuss, and generally approved of the idea of the marriage between him and his niece.
He married, secondly, Allene Tew (1872-1955), daughter of Charles Henry Tew and Janet Smith, on 10 April 1929 at Paris, France. He and Allene Tew were divorced on 31 October 1935 at Paris, France. He is a member of the second limb of the younger branch of the House of Reuss, and his son, born 1916, is Heinrich II. He is not to be confused with the head of his branch of the house, his cousin Prince Heinrich XXXIX, who married the Countess of Castell-Castell (at Castell) and whose sons are Heinrich IV, Heinrich VI and Heinrich VII.
In 1936, Princess Heinrich XXXIII of Reuss, the former Arlene Tew of Jamestown, and Count Paul De Kotzebue, Russian nobleman, married in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday. The marriage would be the fifth for the princess, described as one of the wealthiest of American women, and the first for the count. Shortly after the ceremony they were to come to the United States bringing with them young Prince Heinrich of Reuss, whose guardian the princess had become. Princess Heinrich inherited a fortune from her first husband, Theodore R. Hostetter of Pittsburgh. Her divorce from the prince was said to have been caused by his espousal of the Nazi cause. 
He died on 15 November 1942 at age 63 at Stonsdorf. He gained the title of Prinz Reuss zu Köstritz.

Major Zod (Smallville)

General Zod appears as a recurring villain in "Smallville", although off-screen at first. References to Zod began with season five's season premiere "Arrival", which featured two Kryptonian disciples of Zod (who arrived on Earth in the meteor shower of the season-four finale) searching for Clark Kent (Tom Welling). The season concludes with the Kryptonian artificial intelligence known as Brainiac (James Marsters), having granted Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) Kryptonian superpowers, is able to make him host for Zod's consciousness. The season-six première opens with Zod (Rosenbaum) set to rule over a devastated Metropolis. However, Clark is able to evict Zod's consciousness and send it back to the Phantom Zone. Zod's disembodied spirit resembles Terence Stamp. In season eight's "Bloodline", Zod's wife Faora escapes the Phantom Zone and inhabits the body of Lois Lane (Erica Durance). She reveals that she and Zod genetically engineered a son—Davis Bloome (Sam Witwer), "Smallville"s version of Doomsday—after they discovered they could not have children. Zod and Faora sent Doomsday to Earth to destroy the planet and the infant Clark. Faora also remarks that Davis (Witwer) strongly resembles Zod. In the season-eight finale "Doomsday," Zod's symbol is burnt into the grass by the Orb in the possession of Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman); a man stands on the burning lawn (a brief, uncredited portrayal by Witwer).
Season Nine introduces the return of General Zod as his 20-year-younger clone, Major Zod (British actor Callum Blue), as a main character. It is revealed that before Krypton exploded, Zod duplicated his DNA when he was still a Kandorian Major, before committing the atrocities for which he is known, with Jor-El treating the DNA samples with blue kryptonite to prevent the resulting clones manifesting abilities on Earth. Kelly Sounders observes, "over the course of the season, the venomous side of Zod rises because he experiences a few key betrayals with our beloved characters.Season nine begins with Tess as Zod's prisoner in the Luthor mansion; he and many other weakened Kandorians live there. In "Metallo", Zod and his soldiers use LuthorCorp equipment to create the supervillain Metallo (Brian Austin Green) using Kryptonian scientific knowledge. Zod discovers that he is a clone in "Kandor". Lois, having seen the future when she accidentally used a ring Clark had recceived from the Legion of Super-Heroes to travel forward in time by a year, attempts to prevent General Zod and the Kandorians (who have regained their abilities) from ruling Earth. In the episode "Disciple", he introduces himself to an injured Lois Lane. Clark uses his blood to revive a dying Zod in "Conspiracy", which has the side effect of awakening Zod's abilities. Zod masquerades as "the Blur" to trick Lois into helping him investigate Tess Mercer, until Lois discovers the duplicity. Although Clark is able to convince Zod's followers to leave him when they learn he killed a pregnant Faora for objecting to his plans of conquest, Zod and Clark battle, both powerless due to the effects of Blue Kryptonite as part of Zod's attempt to escape being teleported to New Krypton. The episode ends with Clark in free-fall and Zod ascending, since he is taken out of Earth by the Kryptonian book of Rao and sent to New Krypton after the Blue Kryptonite is removed from his presence. Zod makes a final appearance in the season ten (2011) episode "Dominion". The other Kandorians had chosen to punish Zod by sending him to the Phantom Zone, where he was reunited with the disembodied spirit of General Zod, resulting in the two combining into a physical form with the memories of the original and clone Zods. The united Zod's hatred of Clark is further intensified, prompting him to arrange an elaborate trap to lure Clark into the Zone. Despite an attempt by Darkseid to use a brainwashed Green Arrow to trap Clark in the Zone, Clark and Oliver manage to escape, destroying the exit and trapping Zod in the Zone for good.
Comparison to the Devil.
In Season 9 episode "Salvation", Zod can be compared to the devil as he refuses to go to New Krypton, and shouts the famous John Milton quote: "Better to rule in Hell, than to serve in Heaven!"

Lolark Sasthi

Lolark Shasthi is a festival celebrated near the Tulsi Ghat in Varanasi, India. It falls during the monsoon season, on the sixth day of the bright half of the month of Bhadrapada (usually in September). Dedicated to Surya, the Sun God, Varanasi will witness the holy dip taken by thousands of female devotees in the ancient stepwell pond of Lolark Kund (a sacred water body) and mark the festival of Lolarak. Couples from Varanasi and its neighbouring villages will perform religious rituals and pray to Lord Lolark Aditya that they be blessed with a child. Devotees will leave their clothes and a fruit or a vegetable (from which they pledge to abstain thereafter) in the kund after taking a holy dip in the Lolark kund. Many do so with hopes for a male child/heir or offspring. As thousands come to bathe in the holy waters of the Lolark kund at sun rise, a make shift colourful bazaar mushrooms around the kund. Families cook puris on open camp fires all around the ancient kund. Steps lead down to the Kund from three sides. On the fourth side, the kund takes the shape of an enlonged, arched well, pointing into the direction of the rising sun (Ganges). Some devotees also throw considerable amounts of gold jewellary into the pond, which may later be harvested and distributed amongst the Mahant and Brahmins in order to finance the event and it's clean-up afterwards.

<doc id="36712588" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36712588" title="Omnishambles">
Omnishambles

Omnishambles is a neologism first used in the BBC political satire "The Thick of It". The word is compounded from the Latin prefix "omni-", meaning "all", and the word "shambles", meaning a situation of total disorder. The word refers to a situation which is seen as shambolic from all possible perspectives. It gained popularity in 2012 after sustained usage in the political sphere led to it being named "Oxford English Dictionary" Word of the Year, and it was formally added to the online editions of the "Oxford English Dictionary" in August 2013. 
Background.
The term was coined by writer Tony Roche, and first used at the end of the first episode of the third series of BBC political satire "The Thick of It", broadcast in 2009, during which Nicola Murray (Rebecca Front) is drafted in as a cabinet minister for the fictional Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship at the behest of the government's director of communications Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi). Murray's first day as a cabinet minister is fraught by press inquiries into her husband's involvement in a private finance initiative contract, her appropriating an expensive office chair from a staff member, and her intention to send her daughter to a private school. Tucker sends Murray to launch a by-election campaign, but a communications error results in her standing in front of the candidate's poster and blocking most of the letters so the signs appears to read "I am bent" as she is filmed and photographed. Tucker believes Murray to be a potential cause of political controversy, and his patience expires when it is revealed the minister is afraid of elevators. Tucker then delivers an angry rebuke to her:
The term was popularised by Labour Party leader and Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband MP, in a speech to the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions on 18 April 2012, criticising the government's 2012 budget and the resulting public image:
The term was again used in Parliament by Opposition politicians to criticise various government actions: by Chuka Umunna, Ed Balls, Steve Rotherham, Julie Hilling, Rachel Reeves, and Catherine McKinnell to criticise the budget; Yvette Cooper to criticise the failed deportation of Abu Qatada; and Ivan Lewis, Margaret Curran, and Caroline Flint in reference to the perceived ineffectualness of the government. The term was adapted for use in Scottish politics by Labour MSP Richard Baker, who referred to First Minister Alex Salmond's refusal to admit to a lack of legal advice on an independent Scotland's accession to the European Union as a "Scomnishambles".
Due to its adoption as a political catchprase, the editors of the "Collins English Dictionary" submitted the word for the dictionary's first public consultation into new additions, defining it as "something which is completely and continuously shambolic". In news coverage preceding the fourth series of "The Thick of It", use of the word "omnishambles" was cited by the cast and crew as an example of life imitating art; in an interview with ShortList, series co-writer Will Smith commented that politicians were "watching the show and embracing it", describing Miliband's use of the phrase as "baffling".
A similar term, "Romneyshambles" was created as a political attack during the 2012 US presidential election based on comments eventual nominee Mitt Romney made criticizing London's preparations for the 2012 Summer Olympics.
On 13 November 2012, omnishambles was named Word of the Year by the "Oxford English Dictionary". Lexicographer and judge on the panel Fiona McPherson remarked that: "It was a word everyone liked, which seemed to sum up so many of the events over the last 366 days in a beautiful way."
The word was formally added to the online editions of the "Oxford English Dictionary" in August 2013 together with a number of other words that had also gained popularity during 2012 and 2013. These included selfie, twerk and digital detox.

On October 7, he was the man of the match against Bella Vista scoring a goal and an assist for his team's 2-0 victory. His third goal came six days later, in a 1-1 away draw against Fénix.
International career.
Lucas launched his international career for Canada at 18 years old, debuting for the U-20 team in 2011 during the CONCACAF U-20 Championship in Guatemala.
Lucas has earned three call-ups to Canada's U-23 National team and his performance, along with the fact that he "plays in a different type of league (down in Uruguay)," according to Head Coach Stephen Hart, earned him his first call up to the senior roster to face Trinidad & Tobago in a friendly match on August 13, 2012. Cavallini made his debut for Canada as a second half substitute for Terry Dunfield against Trinidad, the game ended in a 2-0 victory for the Canadians.

History of the South African Air Force

The History of the South African Air Force spans the First World War, Rand Rebellion of 1922, the Second World War, the Korean War, the South African Border War, and varied peacekeeping operations since 1994. Its battle honours include German South West Africa 1914–15, German East Africa 1915–1918, East Africa: 1939–1941, Middle East: 1941–43, Madagascar 1942, Italy 1943–1945, the Balkans 1943–1945, and Korea 1950–1953.
Origins and first flying school.
The first winged flight in South Africa is thought to have been made around 1875 by John Goodman Houshold in a primitive glider in the Karkloof district of Natal. The first powered flight is attributed to the French aviator Albert Kimmerling in late 1909 or early 1910 at East London. In June 1911 the South African John Weston flew a Weston-Farman for 8.5 minutes, a South African record time for a sustained flight. Demonstrations by Weston followed well into 1912 and at a large number of locations. In December 1911 two visiting aviators, Cecil Compton Patterson flying a Patterson No. 2 Biplane and Evelyn Driver flying a Bleriot biplane, started flying demonstration flights in the Cape and aroused significant public and government interest to the possibilities of powered flight in South Africa. Prompted by the Patterson / Driver displays, General Jan Smuts (Minister of Defence) sent Brig Gen C.F. Beyers (Commandant-General of the Citizen Force) to Britain to observe the 1912 military manoeuvres in Switzerland, Germany, France and England and to report on the viability of using aircraft in military operations. Beyers' response was extremely supportive and encouraging of the establishment of an air corps, particularly for the purpose of aerial scouting. By this time the Patterson / Driver flying syndicate had dissolved and in 1912 Patterson and the Union Defence Force reached an agreement to establish a flying school at Alexandersfontein in Kimberley, known as "Paterson's Aviation Syndicate School of Flying" to train pilots for the proposed South African Aviation Corps (SAAC). Basic flying training commenced in 1913 with ten students, using a Compton-Paterson biplane and six of the students who completed the basic training were sent to the Central Flying School at RAF Upavon in Great Britain for further training. Lt. Kenneth van der Spuy passed his final examination on 2 June 1914 and was granted the certificate of the Royal Aero Club, becoming South Africa's first qualified military pilot. The others passed a few days later, with five of them eventually qualifying. On qualifying, the Union Defence Force granted permission for these aviators to be seconded to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC).
World War I.
German South West Africa.
By June 1915 the SAAC commanded by Major Gerard Wallace, was deployed to its first operational airfield at Karabib in German West Africa. Operations were in support of Gen. Botha's South African ground forces, flying reconnaissance and leaflet dropping missions from Karbib and later from Omaruru, where improvised bombing missions were added when pilots started dropping hand grenades and rudimentary bombs by hand. On 9 July 1915, the German forces capitulated and most of the pilots and aircraft of the SAAC were sent to Britain in support of the Commonwealth war effort.
German East Africa.
Although the SAAC remained active, its activities were limited to ground training at the Cape Town Drill Hall using the two Jeannin Taubes and two damaged (and now no longer air-worthy) B.E.2c's, while the pilots who had been detached to the RFC were grouped to form No. 26 Squadron RFC at Netharavon, becoming an independent squadron on 8 October 1915. No. 26 Squadron was equipped with the ex-SAAC Henri Farman F-27's used in German West Africa and B.E.2c's from the RFC. Shortly after becoming operational, the squadron was shipped to Kenya in support of the war effort in German East Africa, landing in Mombasa on 31 January 1916. The eight aircraft had been shipped in wooden crates and were re-assembled in Mombasa and then flown to a forward airfield prepared inside German East Africa at Mbuyuni, with the South African and British pilots of 26 Squadron (now known as "The South Africa Squadron") being billeted in tents close to their aircraft. The squadron flew reconnaissance and observer missions throughout the campaign until February 1918. The squadron was returned to the UK via Cape Town and arrived at Blandford Camp on 8 July 1918 and was disbanded the same day.
While the SAAC were engaged in German South West Africa and 26 Sqn RFC in East Africa, many South Africans travelled to the United Kingdom to enlist with the Royal Flying Corps. The number of South Africans in the RFC eventually reached approximately 3,000 men and suffered 260 active-duty fatalities. South African airmen took part in aerial reconnaissance and artillery spotting missions over the Somme during the war. Forty six pilots became fighter aces shooting down five or more enemy aircraft, with the most successful, Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor being the British Empire's fourth most successful ace with 54 victories.
War in Europe.
A number of South Africans took part in the civil war in Eastern Europe between 1917 and 1920. The North Russian Expeditionary Force had an Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service detachment which landed in Murmansk in June 1918 and a second expeditionary force with further air assets arrived in 1919. A Sopwith Camel equipped flight of No. 47 Squadron RAF was commanded by South African Capt. Sam Kinkead and a number of South African pilots flew with the squadron, amongst them Kennith van der Spuy who was to become Director-General of Technical Services in the Union Defence Forces from 1940 to 1945 as well as Pierre van Ryneveld who was to become the Chief of Staff of the Union Defence Force during the Second World War.
Inter-war period.
In December 1920 the South African National insignia was added to aircraft for the first time. An Orange, Green, Red and Blue roundel was added to an Avro 504K for trial purposes but the colours were found to be unsuitable and were replaced with a Green, Red, Lemon, Yellow and Blue roundel in December 1921. These colours remained until 1927 when they were replaced with the Orange, White and Blue roundels.
The first operational deployment of the newly formed Air Force was to quell internal dissent, when in 1922 a miner's strike on the Johannesburg gold mines turned violent and led to the declaration of martial law. 1 Squadron was called to fly reconnaissance missions and to bombard the strikers’ positions. Sorties in support of the police amounted to 127 flight hours between 10 and 15 March and this inauspicious start for the SAAF led to two pilot losses, two wounded and two aircraft lost to ground fire. The SAAF was again deployed to suppress the Bondelzwart Rebellion at Kalkfontein between 29 May and 3 July 1922.
The Great Depression of 1929–1933 had led to forced reductions in defence spending and the South African military had received minimal funding, leading to a reduction in staff, facilities and resources. Economic recovery became visible in 1933 and led to an increase in the demand for gold resulting in significant growth for the Union economy. In 1934 a five-year expansion plan was announced whereby the Union Defence Forces (UDF) were to receive increased funding and were to be markedly expanded.
World War II.
Urgent remedial measures were implemented; The lack of combat ready pilots was greatly alleviated by the establishment of the Joint Air Training Scheme (JATS) to train Royal Air Force (RAF), SAAF and other allied air and ground crews at 38 newly created South African air schools. Resources were increased and by September 1941 the SAAF had a personnel strength of 31 204, of whom 956 were pilots, 715 observers and air-gunners, 2 943 basic trainees and 4 321 members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. Urgent aircraft procurement programs resulted in the total number of military aircraft in the Union being increased to 1 709 aircraft (South African based aircraft, excluding those deployed in the different operational areas).
Coastal defence.
At the outbreak of war, South Africa had no naval vessels and the UDF's first priority was to ensure the safety of the South African coastal waters as well as the strategically important Cape sea-route. To provide credible maritime patrol operations, the SAAF took over all 29 of South African Airways' passenger aircraft: eighteen Junkers JU-86Z-l's to be used in the maritime patrol role and eleven Junkers JU-52's for transport purposes. SAAF maritime patrols commenced on 21 September 1939 with 16 Squadron flying three JU-86Z's from Walvis Bay. By 1940, the JU-86s were replaced by Anson's and SAAF Coastal Command had been established, eventually consisting of 6, 10, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 29 Squadrons.
By the end of World War II, SAAF aircraft in conjunction with British and Dutch aircraft stationed in South Africa, had intercepted seventeen enemy ships, assisted in the rescue of 437 survivors of sunken ships and attacked 26 of the 36 enemy submarines that operated around the South African coast and had flown 15,000 coastal patrol sorties by August 1945.
East Africa.
During this campaign the SAAF formed a Close Support Flight consisting of four Gladiators and four Hartbees with an autonomous air force commander operating with the land forces. This was the precursor of the Tactical Air Force "cab-rank" technique which were used extensively for close air support during 1943–1945. The last air combat took place on 29 October and the Italian forces surrendered on 27 November 1940 after which a reduced SAAF presence was maintained in East Africa for coastal patrol purposes until May 1943.
Western Desert and North Africa.
Conditions were however not ideal and pilots and crew were required to operate under critical conditions at times. Pilots were frequently sent home to the Union after gaining experience and did not return for many months, after which conditions in the desert had changed significantly and they were required to regain experience on different aircraft, different tactics and operations from different bases. There were cases where experienced fighter pilots were sent back to the Western Desert as bomber pilots for their second tour – compounding the lack of continuity and experience. The South Africans did however command the respect of their German adversaries: "I personally had a firm conviction that the Australian squadrons fought less stubbornly than the English and the South Africans. Of the French we heard only rumours, and of the Poles – I believe that our aversion was reciprocal." Rudolf Sinner, II/JG27, 1942.
The South Africans had the distinction of dropping the first and last bombs in the African conflict – the first being on 11 June 1940 on Moyale in Abyssinia and the last being on the Italian 1st Army in Tunisia. The SAAF also produced a number of SAAF WWII air aces in the process, including John Frost, Sailor Malan, Gerald Stapleton and Marmaduke Pattle.
Madagascar.
In fear of Japanese occupation and subsequent operations in the Indian Ocean in close proximity to South African sea lanes, Field-Marshal Smuts encouraged the preemptive Allied occupation of the island of Madagascar. After much debate and further encouragement by General de Gaulle (who was urging for a Free French operation against Madagascar), Churchill and the Chiefs of Staff agreed to an invasion by means of a strong fleet and adequate air support. In March and April 1942, the SAAF had been conducting reconnaissance flights over Diego Suarez and 32, 36 and 37 Coastal Flights were withdrawn from South African maritime patrol operations and sent to Lindi on the Indian Ocean coast of Tanzania, with an additional eleven Beauforts and six Marylands to provide ongoing reconnaissance and close air support for the planned operation – to be known as "Operation Ironclad".
During the amphibious / air assault carried out by the Royal Navy and Air Force on 5 May, the Vichy French Air Force consisting mainly of Morane fighters and Potez bombers had attacked the Allied fleet but had been neutralised by the Fleet Air Arm aircraft from the two aircraft carriers. Those remaining aircraft not destroyed were withdrawn by the French and flown south to other airfields on the island. Once the main airfield at Arrachart aerodrome in Diego Suarez had been secured (13 May 1942), the SAAF Air Component flew from Lindi to Arrachart. The air component consisted of thirty-four aircraft (6 Marylands, 11 Beaufort Bombers, 12 Lockheed Lodestars and 6 JU52's transports). By September 1942, the South African ground forces committed to "Ironclad" had been party to the capturing the southern half of Madagascar as well as the small island of Nossi Be with the SAAF air component supporting these operations. During the campaign which ended with an armistice on 4 November 1942, SAAF aircraft flew a total of 401 sorties with one pilot killed in action, one killed in an accident and one succumbing to disease. Seven aircraft were lost, only one as a result of enemy action.
Sicilian and Italian campaigns.
By the end of May 1943, the SAAF had two Wings and sixteen squadrons in the Middle East and North Africa with 8,000 men. With the end of the North African campaign, the SAAF role underwent change – becoming more active in fighter bomber, bomber and PR operations as opposed to the fighter role performed in the desert.
Five SAAF squadrons were designated to support the July 1943 invasion of Sicily – 1 Squadron operated combat air patrols over the beaches for the "Operation Husky" landings while 2, 4 and 5 Squadrons provided fighter bomber support during the Sicilian campaign. 30 Squadron (flying as No. 223 Squadron RAF during the campaign) provided light bomber support from Malta and 60 Squadron was responsible for photo reconnaissance flights in support of all Allied forces on the island. After successfully invading the island, a further three squadrons were moved to Sicily and the eight squadrons on the island were tasked with supporting the invasion of Italy: 12 and 24 Squadrons were responsible for medium bomber missions to "soften up" the enemy prior to the invasion while 40 Sqn was responsible for tactical photo-reconnaissance. 1 Squadron provided fighter cover for the 3 September 1943 landings while 2 and 4 Squadrons were responsible for bomber escort.
Commonwealth Joint Air Training Scheme.
The Joint Air Training Scheme was a major programme for training South African Air Force, Royal Air Force and Allied air crews during World War II. An Elementary Flying Training School (EFTS) gave a recruit 50 hours of basic aviation instruction on simple trainer aircraft and pilots who showed further promise went on to training at a Service Flying Training School (STFS). The Service Flying Training School provided advanced training for pilots, including fighter and multi-engined aircraft while other trainees went on to different specialties, such as wireless, navigation or bombing and gunnery training. In South Africa, the Elementary Flying Training School and Service Flying Training School curricula were grouped together and known as "Training Air Schools". Thirty-five such air schools were established in South Africa for Commonwealth pilot and crew training. The facilities were under SAAF control and were distributed throughout the country with training being conducted using a wide variety of aircraft (depending on the purpose of the training). The training scheme was in operation from 1939 to 1945. 
Berlin airlift.
Although no SAAF aircraft participated in the 1948–1949 Berlin Airlift, the SAAF supplied 20 aircrews to support the effort. The air-crews flew to Britain via east Africa, Egypt and Malta and were assigned to fly RAF C-47 Dakotas as part of the Royal Air Force effort after receiving advanced training on the aircraft type at RAF Bassingbourne. They flew 1,240 missions and delivered 4,133 tons of supplies. The sorties were flown from Lubeck in West Germany into RAF Gatow in West Berlin. On return trips, the aircraft frequently carried civilians in need of evacuation from occupied Berlin, especially orphaned children who were placed with families in the West. The Soviet blockade of Berlin was lifted at midnight on 12 May 1949 but flights continued for some time after this date to stockpile additional supplies in Berlin. By 24 July 1949, a three-month surplus had been accumulated and the Airlift officially ended on 30 September 1949.
Korean War.
At the outbreak of the Korean War the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of the North Korean Forces. A request was also made to all UN members for assistance. After a special Cabinet meeting on 20 July 1950 the Union Government announced that due to the long distance between South Africa and Korea, direct ground based military participation in the conflict was impractical and unrealistic but that a SAAF fighter squadron would be made available to the UN effort. The 50 officers and 157 other ranks of 2 Sqn SAAF sailed from Durban on 26 September 1950 – they had been selected from 1,426 members of the Permanent Force who had initially volunteered for service. This initial contingent was commanded by Cmdt S. van Breda Theron DSO, DFC, AFC and included many World War II SAAF veterans. The squadron was moved to Johnson Air Base near Tokyo on 25 September 1950 for conversion training on the F-51D Mustangs supplied by the US Air Force. 
On completion of conversion training, the squadron was deployed as one of the four USAF 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing squadrons and on 16 November 1950 an advance detachment consisting of 13 officers and 21 other ranks (including the Squadron Commander and his four Flight Commanders who made the crossing in their own F-51D Mustangs) left Japan for Pusan East (K-9) Air Base in Korea to fly with the USAF pilots in order to familiarize themselves with the local operational conditions. On the morning of 19 November 1950, Cmdt Theron and Capt G.B. Lipawsky took off with two USAF pilots to fly the first SAAF combat sorties of the Korean War from K-9 and K-24 airfileds at Pyong Yang.
On 30 November the squadron was moved further south to K-13 airfield due to North Korean and Chinese advances. It was again moved even further south after the UN forces lost additional ground to the North Koreans to K-10 airfield situated on the coast close to the town of Chinhae within the Pusan Perimeter. This was to be the squadron's permanent base for the duration of their first Korean deployment. During this period (while equipped with F-51D Mustangs) the squadron flew 10,373 sorties and lost 74 aircraft out of the total 95 allocated. Twelve pilots were killed in action, 30 missing and four wounded.
In January 1953 the squadron returned to Japan for conversion to the USAF F-86F Sabre fighter-bombers. The first Sabre mission was flown on 16 March 1953 from the K-55 airfield in South Korea, being the first SAAF jet mission flown. The squadron was tasked with fighter sweeps along the Yalu and Chong-Chong rivers as well as close air support attack misisons. The squadron flew 2,032 sorties in the Sabres losing four out of the 22 aircraft supplied.
The war ended on 27 July 1953, when the was signed. During the first phase of the war, the main task of the squadron Mustangs was the interdiction of enemy supply routes which not only accounted for approximately 61.45% of SAAF combat sorties, but which reached an early peak from January to May 1951 (78% and 82%). A typical interdiction mission was an armed reconnaissance patrol usually undertaken by flights of two or four aircraft armed with two napalm bombs, 127 mm rockets and 12.7 mm machine guns. Later, after the introduction of the Sabres, the squadron was also called on to provide counter-air missions flying as fighter sweeps and interceptions against MiG-15's, but interdiction and close air support remained the primary mission. Losses were 34 SAAF pilots killed, eight taken prisoner (including the future Chief of the Air Force, General D Earp) with 74 Mustangs and 4 Sabres lost. Pilots and men of the squadron received a total of 797 medals including 2 Silver Stars – the highest award to non-American nationals – 3 Legions of Merit, 55 Distinguished Flying Crosses and 40 Bronze Stars. In recognition of their association with 2 Squadron, the OC of 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing issued a policy directive "that all retreat ceremonies shall be preceded by the introductory bars of the South African national anthem. All personnel will render the honour to this anthem as our own."
On conclusion of hostilities, the Sabres were returned to the USAF and the squadron returned to South Africa in October 1953. During this period, the Union Defence Forces were reorganised into individual services and the SAAF became an arm of service in its own right, under an Air Chief of Staff (who was renamed "Chief of the Air Force" in 1966). It adopted a blue uniform, to replace the army khaki it had previously worn.
Border War.
The SAAF provided air support to the army during the 1975–76 Angola campaign, and in the many cross-border operations that were carried out against PLAN bases in Angola and Zambia from 1977 onwards.
At least two MiG-21s of the Angolan Air Force were shot down by 3 Squadron SAAF Mirage F1s in 1981 and 1982.
The SAAF was also heavily involved in the 1987–88 Angola campaign, before the peace settlement that ended the conflict. The international arms embargo imposed against the then-apartheid government of South Africa, meant that the SAAF was unable to procure modern fighter aircraft to compete with the sophisticated Soviet-supplied air defence network and Cuban Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23s fielded in the latter part of this conflict. South Africa collaborated with Israel, obtained blueprints by stealth, and innovatively designed and delivered the Cheetah fighter to overcome this challenge, while the Israelis delivered their Kfir fighter out of this joint venture. Both aircraft could use MiG engines which were easily obtained in either region.
From 1990 with the perceived reduction in threat, SAAF operational strength began to be reduced. The first short term steps entailed the withdrawal of several obsolete aircraft types from service, such as the Canberra B(1)12, the Super Frelon and Westland Wasp helicopters, the Kudu light aircraft and the P-166s Albatross coastal patrol aircraft. Other initial measures included the downgrading of Air Force Base Port Elizabeth and the disbanding of 12, 16, 24, 25, and 27 Squadrons. Two Commando squadrons – 103 Squadron SAAF at AFB Bloemspruit and 114 Squadron SAAF at AFB Swartkop – were also disbanded.
Major air operations.
During the bush war, the SAAF lost a total of 22 aircraft (1974–1989) to enemy action. A further 11 aircraft were lost in the operational area due to pilot error or malfunction.
Missile based air defence.
From the early 1960s, the South African Air Force was also responsible for command of all Surface-to-air missile forces as part of the air defence of South Africa and South West Africa. In July 1964, South Africa placed a development contract with Thomson-CSF for a mobile, all-weather, low-altitude SAM system after a South African order for the Bloodhound SAM system was refused by the UK government. The South African government paid 85 per cent of the development costs of the system with the balance being paid for by France. The system was known as "Cactus" within the SAAF and "Crotale" in France. The units were operationally deployed in platoons in 1971 with each platoon consisting of one Acquisition and Co-ordination Unit (ACU) and two or three firing units, with a battery having two platoons. All Cactus air defence batteries were placed under command of 120 Squadron until the retirement of the system in the late 1980s.
Since 1994.
After the first multi-racial elections were held in 1994, the SAAF became an integrated air force as part of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF).
The South African Air Force is currently considered to be the most effective air force in sub-Sahara Africa despite the loss of capability as a consequence of defence cuts after the end of the Border War. These financial cuts have brought about a number of severe operational limitations, compounded by the loss of experienced air-crews. This has placed strain on the bringing new types of aircraft into service, specifically the Gripen, Hawk, Rooivalk, A 109 and Lynx. The cancellation of the SAAF participation and procurement of the A400M in November 2009 has prevented the SAAF from any strategic airlift capability needed for domestic, regional and continent-wide operations. There is no clear indication as yet regarding how the heavy/long-range airlift gap will be addressed. Current air combat capabilities are limited to the Gripen multi-role fighter and the Rooivalk combat support helicopter – although in insufficient number to allow regional deployments while maintaining national air space protection and training obligations. To overcome this shortfall, the SAAF has designated the Hawk Mk 120 trainers for additional tactical reconnaissance and weapon delivery platforms for targets designated by the Gripen's. Financial constraints have further limited flying hours on the newly acquired aircraft; it is planned to keep Gripen pilots current flying the lower cost Hawk aircraft with "Gripenised" cockpits. The number of current Gripen pilots is currently (2011) classified as secret.

Sagaan Ubgen

Sagaan Ubgen ("The elder White", "White Old Man"; Mongolian: Buryat: Russian: ) is the Mongolian guardian of life and longevity, one of the symbols of fertility and prosperity in the Buddhist pantheon. He is worshiped as a deity in what scholars have called "white shamanism", a subdivision of what scholars have called "Buryat yellow shamanism"—that is, a tradition of shamanism that "incorporate Buddhist rituals and beliefs" and is influenced specifically by Tibetan Buddhism. Sagaan Ubgen originated in Mongolia.
In some versions of the mythology, Sagaan Ubgen the White Elder is the partner of Itügen, Mother Earth, also known as Etügen Eke.
Syncretic incorporation into the Buddhist pantheon.
The modern Mongolian and Buryat Buddhist pantheons include Sagaan Ubgen, like many other figures in those pantheons, as a result of syncretism with the indigenous shamanism of the region. Before the introduction of Buddhism to Mongolia and Buryatia, he was the deity of longevity, wealth, and fertility. To account for his continued veneration as part of Buddhist practice, narratives have been added to his existing mythology, providing tales of how he was converted to Buddhism, and making him a patron of the latter religion, at the same time that he continues in his previous, more worldly, religious functions. One version of the story relates how, while the Buddha and his disciples were out walking one day, they met Sagaan Ubgen, who so impressed the Buddha with his wisdom that he (Buddha) declared Sagaan Ubgen to be a "saint". A different version of the tale has Sagaan Ubgen as one of two hunters, the other being Hara Ubgen (), who, out hunting, encounter Milarepa in Milarepa's Cave. Milarepa persuades them to give up hunting and to take up the teaching of Buddhism.
Appearance and iconography.
Sagaan Ubgen is often depicted similarly to the Tibetan deity Pehar, or to the Chinese star elder Shousin, who like Sagaan Ubgen is a patron deity of family longevity, wealth, and health. His conventional appearance is that of a bald old man with a white beard. He carries a dragon-headed staff and the book of destiny, and is traditionally accompanied by a deer and a peach tree.
In Mongolian "tsam" and Tibetan "cham" dances.
Sagaan Ubgen has the same kindly bald old man with a white beard appearance in Mongolian tsam dance. There, he appears alongside other masked characters representing other syncretic Buddhist gods such as Begze, Makhakala, and Garuda; and is one of the few characters in the dance who is able to speak.
The Elder White character was imported from Mongolian tsam dance into Tibetan cham dance in the 20th century by order of the 13th Dalai Lama, who had a dream during his exile in Mongolia. He is named "rgan po dkar po", or simply "rgan dkar", in Tibetan, and was first introduced into cham as part of the New Year dance of the Potala at the rNam rgyal monastery. From there, he spread to cham dance in other monasteries throughout Tibet.
In cham, Sagaan Ubgen, dressed in all-white with a snuff bottle attached to his girdle, is the main character in the tiger dance, which symbolizes the transition to the new year from the old. He enters the dance area weak and staggering, or even being carried. After symbolically killing a tiger, by striking a tiger skin with a stick, his strength is renewed. In some variations of the dance, he then proceeds to pass among the audience seeking donations of money, sometimes offering a peck of snuff from his bottle in return. In other variations, he begins to drink alcohol and continue dancing until he is too drunk to dance.

Soers

Soers is a community within Aachen and part of the district of Aachen-Laurensberg. The predominantly rural district today stretches from the border of Aachen-Mitte, the central district of Aachen, past the slopes of the Lousberg, a hill in the north of the city. It is a wetland that is drained by several rivers. The Wurm drains at out of the area's north end, and is the only drain of the Rur River in the Aachen Basin. Soers is known mainly as a result of the Old Tivoli, the former football stadium of Alemannia Aachen.
The area's largely undeveloped nature and its easy access to the A4 motorway has caused the community to become further developed in recent years. The police headquarters of Aachen were constructed there, as well as the Aachen Prison and Aachen's tax office. 
Sport Park Soers.
The city of Aachen, the Aachen-Laurensberg Riding Club ("Rennverein"), and Alemannia Aachen adopted an integrated event and site management for the Sports Park Soers. Much of the sports facilities, including parking and green areas, are shared. These facilities are located on highway 57 and are easily accessible via the A4 motorway, as well as by the bus lines 51 and 151. The public transit authority of Aachen (ASEAG) provides additional buses on event days.
The Sports Park Soers contains the following sports facilities and buildings:

Lake Tahoe Dam

Lake Tahoe Dam is a concrete gravity dam on the Truckee River, at the outlet of Lake Tahoe in Placer County. 
The dam is located in Tahoe City and serves as the main storage facility for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Newlands Project that also includes the Lahontan Dam and two diversion dams, providing irrigation water for of cropland mainly in the Lahontan Valley of western Nevada. The present Lake Tahoe dam replaced an older, privately owned dam built in 1870 at roughly the same location.

Dividing By Zero

Dividing By Zero is the fourth studio album released by the indie rock band Seven Storey Mountain, as well as its second and final while using the shortened moniker Seven Storey. It was released on February 19, 2002 by Deep Elm Records.
Album information.
Lance Lammers did all of the heavy lifting for this record. In addition to contributing vocals and guitar parts, he is also responsible for producing, engineering, recording, and mixing this album. Dave Norwood played bass while Chad Kinney played drums.
Finally, John Szuch at Deep Elm Records is responsible for the record's layout and design.
Reception.
Described as a mixture of "the emotive song structure of Washington, D.C., indie rock with the harsh playing of the New York hardcore scene", "Dividing By Zero" received a moderate to positive reception from the critics.
Some of the record's most positive feedback came from Interpunk.com, where a critic called it "ten tracks of orchestrated rage...blending the finest aspects of hardcore power, punk energy, rock style and indie intelligence." That critic found that "Lance Lammers has a perfect set of chops - equally harsh and melodic - presented with an overriding, forceful conviction" and concluded that "[these are some of the best rock songs you've heard in a long, long time." Dennis Scanland at Music Emission was equally free with his praise of the album. For him, members of the band "get loud but never obnoxious and they stay focused even with their loud bursts that they erupt with at times." As a result, he found that ""Dividing By Zero" is one of the strongest albums that I have heard so far this year," concluding that it is "nice to see a young band with as much vision as Seven Storey."
J. Berk at Splendidzine wrote that "he songs are jerky and intense, and provide a perfect backdrop for Lance Lammers' pissed-off vocals." Although Berk found Lammers' vocals to be "screamy at times," he was pleased that they were "mostly restrained" and that Lammers' "obvious need to vent get in the way of turning in a few gentle melodies and catchy hooks." While Berk does not appear to have fallen in love with the album, he admits that he found it "unexpectedly satisfying on an intellectual level."
While some critics gave the record a more lukewarm reception, even they could not hold back completely. Bettie Lou Vegas at Ink19 listened to the record and wrote: "Seven Storey is something I would have played into the ground in 1993. While I don't salivate over it now in 2002, it's still quite good." Scott at Punknews.org didn't find that record passé, instead he felt that the band might have had more to give. In his review, he wrote that "The album definitely has strong points with tracks like 'Unknown Satellite' and 'Dress Rehearsal,' but the majority of the rest of the album only displays the band's potential. Give this band 5 more years with this new lineup and I bet they'll be able to do something amazing. Until then, they're be in semi-heavy rotation on my college radio show, because that's where good rock like this belongs."

Battle of Krasnokutsk–Gorodnoye

The Battle of Krasnokutsk–Gorodnoye took place on February 20–22, 1709 (Gregorian calendar), in the Swedish campaign of Russia during the Great Northern War 1700-1721. The Swedish troops were directly led by Charles XII King of Sweden who persecuted a force of Russians commanded by Karl Evald von Rönne from the minor battle of Krasnokutsk to the town Gorodnoye where a new battle took place. The Swedes were victorious but cancelled their offensive when the night fell.
Prelude.
During the end of the 17th century Russia, Denmark-Norway, Saxony and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth formed an allegiance against the Swedish Empire in order to regain what was lost in earlier wars. However, three of the original four nations were defeated in the span of seven years, leaving only Russia to stand up against the Swedish invasions. In 1707 Charles XII began his campaign of Russia and strove through victories as Holowczyn – 1708 and the siege of Veprik – 1708, but also through setbacks as the Swedish defeat at Lesnaya – 1708. Charles reached the outskirts of Krasnokutsk not long after Veprik and there encountered a small force of Russians which he engaged and managed to take several prisoners who told him that Rönne would be close-by Krasnokutsk with about 5,000 dragoons. He then began his march there.
Engagement.
He arrived at February 20, with a companion of 2,500 cavalry, many of whom were the elite guards (Drabants). He quickly engaged the 5,000 Russians under command of Rönne who had taken defensive positions at the end of the small town. Rönne and his force couldn't handle the cavalry shock and almost immediately began to retreat and in disorder they split up in two parts, one ran against a nearby hill and the other one against the nearby river Merla. Charles persecuted the ones heading up the hill and left Colonel Dücker to hunt down those crossing the river. 
During the pursuit many Russians were killed in orders from the Swedish king who didn't want to waste any time on captured prisoners during the fast forced chase, but instead catch up with the main bulk of the Russian fleeing army. After a thirteen-hours pursuit they reached Gorodnoye where Rönne made a new stand to repulse the Swedish cavalry. Also with new fresh reinforcements now numbering somewhere between 5,000–10,000. Charles halted his army after discovering this and tried to organize his fairly outspread men. 
Rönne then saw an opportunity to strike and launched a huge cavalry assault against the exhausted and numerical disadvantaged Swedish troops. This caused them to rout and run back the way they came. The roles were suddenly reversed and the pre-hunting Swedes were now persecuted by the pre-hunted Russians. Charles and his drabant-companions got separated from the bulk of the army and in personal danger the king fought off the many Russian followers together with his few men. 
After some time when the situation was faded to the very critical for the surrounded Swedes, Carl Gustaf Kruse showed up with some new fresh cavalry regiments who charged in and routed the Russians and saved the Swedish king. Rönne pulled his forces away from Gorodnoye and retreated in good order after discovering this. Charles then pulled his troops into Gorodnoye and engaged the remaining Russians but didn't want to chase the ones retreating even further due to the approaching night.
Aftermath.
About 1,500 Russians were either killed or wounded during the engagements, Rönne had pulled his forces back and left the way more open for the Swedish army to march against Moscow. However, the cold weather and the scorched earth tactic the Russians used forced Charles XII plans to waste. 
The Swedish casualties were 132 killed and wounded during the engagements, the drabants had suffered 10 dead and many wounded. It's said that Charles showed a lot of personal bravery during the fighting. The campaign however, ended not long after, in 1709 when the Swedish army suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of Poltava, which ended the time for Sweden as the leading power in the war. Krasnokutsk and Gorodnoye was later burned down by the Swedes, the consequences were fatal, anti-Swedish guerilla warfare began against them.

Gibson Dam

Gibson Dam is a concrete arch dam on the Sun River, a tributary of the Missouri River, about west of Great Falls, Montana in the United States. Located on the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, the dam was built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) between 1926 and 1929 as part of the Sun River Project to develop about of irrigated land in the Sun River Valley.
Specifications.
The dam is a high and long arch gravity structure, with a base thickness of tapering to at the crest. As a whole the dam contains about of concrete. The impounded water forms Gibson Reservoir, which can store up to at full water levels of . When full, the reservoir covers , with a shoreline of roughly and a maximum depth of . Water releases are controlled by two sets of outlets: three release valves at the base of the dam have a combined capacity of , while a gated tunnel spillway, controlled by six 34x12 ft (10x4 m) radial gates, can pass a maximum of .
Gibson Dam's main function is to capture spring snowmelt and release it during summer for the irrigation for about of land on the north side of the Sun River and south of the river. Water released from Gibson travels downstream for about before it is intercepted by the Sun River Diversion Dam, which diverts water into the Pishkun Supply Canal, which sends water to the offstream Pishkun Reservoir. The Sun River Slope Canal System takes water from Pishkin Reservoir to serve the irrigated lands on the north side of the river. The headworks for the Fort Shaw Canal, which serves the lands south of the river, are located further downstream and take water directly from the river. The lands north of the river comprise the Greenfields Irrigation District, while the south side is run by the Fort Shaw Irrigation District.
History.
On September 26, 1906, the Department of the Interior authorized the USBR's Sun River Project, under pressure from local residents, namely those of Great Falls, who wanted the irrigation of lands east of the Rocky Mountains along the Sun and Teton Rivers. Early proposals included the diversion of streams from west of the Continental Divide to augment the arid region's water supply, but eventually the project was pared down to comprise two storage dams on the Sun River and a tributary, Willow Creek; two off-stream reservoirs and a diversion dam; and seven main canals.
As early as 1889, the Gibson Dam site – located in a narrow mountain gap a few miles above the mouth of the Sun River canyon – had been identified by U.S. surveyor Herbert Wilson as an excellent location to develop water storage on the Sun River. More detailed studies in 1911 by the USBR (then the U.S. Reclamation Service) confirmed Wilson's idea, and the first plans for a dam were drafted around 1920. However, it was not until September 1926 when the $1.5 million main construction contract was given to Utah Construction Company. The dam was one of the first to be built using the trial-load method, which relies primarily on mathematical calculations to determine the pressure of water on the structure, and thus the dam's final design. This method allowed the USBR to save an estimated of concrete, lowering costs significantly, since otherwise a considerable safety margin would have had to be built into the dam.
Actual construction started in December 1926, with Albert E. Paddock as project superintendent and Ralph Lowry as construction engineer. Preliminary excavations and site clearing were followed by the placement of a wooden flume to divert the river before concrete pouring in the foundation work could begin. When the foundations were complete, the flume was closed and water allowed to pass through outlet holes in the base of the dam. Concrete for the dam was mixed at a site roughly downstream and transported to the construction site via a light railway. The concrete was then placed via buckets transported by a cableway system, supported by two high towers.
Two penstocks were installed on the south side of the dam and of transmission lines were built connecting the dam and Augusta, Montana in preparation for future hydroelectric generation. However, after determining that the future reservoir would not have enough capacity to sustain power production, USBR sealed the penstocks and the power lines fell into disuse. The dam was completed and the first water stored in December 1929 after three years of construction. At least two people were killed on the project, including Paddock and an unknown workman; the latter fell from a height and struck the former. In 1938, gates were installed in the spillway, increasing the reservoir's storage capacity by 20 percent.
Flood control.
By halting the Sun River's spring freshet, Gibson Dam has prevented an estimated $3,044,000 in flooding damage between 1950 and 1999.
In 1964, western Montana experienced one of the greatest flooding events in its recorded history, when record snowpack followed by heavy early spring rains caused more than $438 million (2011 dollars) of damage in the Flathead and Missouri River basins. On June 8, after reports of at least three dam failures on tributaries of the Missouri sent local residents into a panic, there were rumors that the Gibson Dam had failed. A U.S. Forest Service pilot was sent to investigate and found that water was overtopping the dam by over . The USBR later estimated the peak flow over the dam at , of which at least half was over the crest. After this event the dam was retrofitted so that it could be safely overtopped by up to of water.
Hydroelectric power proposal.
A subsidiary of Toll House Energy Company, Gibson Hydro, has proposed the addition of a 15 megawatt (MW) powerhouse at the base of the dam which would utilize the original 1929 penstocks that were installed by USBR. The powerhouse would generate electricity from irrigation water releases with an estimated annual production of 42.9 million kilowatt hours.

Mohammad Abdul-Wali

Mohammad Abdul-Wali, (1940–1973) was a Yemeni diplomat and a prominent Yemeni writer of Ethiopian descent, and one of the earliest authors in Yemen to adopt writing for artistic purposes rather than for nationalist agendas.
Life.
Abdul-Wali was born in Ethiopia. His mother was Ethiopian and his father had emigrated from northern Yemen. In 1955, Abdul-Wali began his studies at the university of Cairo, where he got interested in Marxism. He was expelled from Egypt, and after a brief period in Yemen he moved to Moscow, where he learnt Russian and studied literature at the Gorky Institute.
After finishing his studies in 1962, he returned to North Yemen, which just had won its independence. He was enrolled in the young country's diplomatic corps and became chargé d'affaires first in Moscow and later in Berlin. He also had a brief spell as head of Yemen Airlines, but fell out of favour with the government and was imprisoned. He died in a never thoroughly investigated airplane crash on his way from Aden to Hadramaut in South Yemen along with a group of other ambassadors.
Works.
Abdul-Wali is considered one of the forerunners of the modern Yemenite literary movement. He published three collections of short stories: "al-Ard, ya Salma" ("Our land, Salma", 1966), "Shay’ ismuhu al-hanin" ("Something called love", 1972) and "’Ammuna Salih" ("Uncle Salih", 1978), as well as two novellas: "Yamutun ghuraba’" ("They Die Strangers") and "San’a’ ... madina maftuha" ("San’a – open city"). His collected works were posthumously published in 1987. The English-language collection "They Die Strangers. A Novella and Stories from Yemen" was published in 2001.
Given his Ethiopian heritage, many of his works dealt with Yemeni immigrants and exiles and the fate of Yemeni-African marriages. His novella "They Die Strangers", for example, is about a Yemeni national who opens a small shop in Addis Ababa but long has a desire to return home.

2012–13 S.L. Benfica season

The 2012–13 season was Sport Lisboa e Benfica's 109th season in existence and the club's 79th consecutive season in the top flight of Portuguese football. It involved Benfica competing in the Primeira Liga, Taça de Portugal, Taça da Liga and the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. Benfica qualified for the Champions League by coming second in the previous Primeira Liga.
In May, it looked as if Benfica could enjoy a treble, if they could win the UEFA Europa League, maintain their lead in the Primeira Liga and win the Taça de Portugal. They lost against FC Porto after conceding a 90th minute goal and despite a win in their last match, they could not stop their rivals from winning the title, afterwards they lost the European final against Chelsea when Branislav Ivanovic headed in an injury-time winner, and their bad luck followed them all the way and denied them the chance to win at least the domestic cup when they blew a one-goal lead and conceded 2 goals in 2 minutes against Vitória Guimarães, thus ending their season without any piece of silverware.
In the Taça de Portugal, Benfica reached the final for the first time since 2004-05 Taça de Portugal, losing to Vitória Guimarães. The Taça da Liga, ended at the semi-finals, preventing Benfica for contesting a fifth title in a row.
In the UEFA Champions League, Benfica finished behind Barcelona and Celtic, being relegated to the UEFA Europa League. In the UEFA Europa League, Benfica reached the final losing 2-1 to Chelsea. It was the club's first European final since the 1990 European Cup Final. 
Review and events.
In manager Jorge Jesus' fourth year with the club, starting midfielders Javi García and Axel Witsel were sold to Manchester City for €23 million and Zenit Saint Petersburg for €40 million, respectively; Nemanja Matić and Enzo Pérez replaced the duo in the regular starting lineup. Striker Javier Saviola's contract was mutually terminated, where he then joined Málaga CF of the Spanish La Liga on a free transfer. Starting left-back Emerson was also sold, joining Turkish club Trabzonspor for a transfer fee of €1.6 million. Other notable outgoing transfers included left-back and former Spanish international Joan Capdevila to RCD Espanyol for €500,000, the loaning of longtime Benfica midfielder Rúben Amorim to Braga, and the loaning of Portuguese international striker Nélson Oliveira to Deportivo de La Coruña. In the winter transfer window, winger Nolito was loaned to Granada CF.
On the right wing, Eduardo Salvio, on loan with Benfica for the 2010–11 season from Atlético Madrid, returned to regain his place after the club paid Atlético €13.5 million for his services. Ola John, part of the FC Twente squad that faced Benfica the year before in UEFA Champions League qualifying, was also purchased for a fee of €9 million, providing Jesus with another option on the left wing behind Nicolás Gaitán, now back on the left wing. Benfica then added striker Lima from Braga, who quickly established himself as a starting striker alongside Óscar Cardozo, relegating Rodrigo to the bench.
For the upcoming season, Benfica also signed depth players Paulo Lopes from Feirense, Luisinho from Paços de Ferreira, Michel from Braga, and Hugo Vieira from Gil Vicente, who was immediately loaned out to Sporting de Gijón. Returning from loan were Lorenzo Melgarejo from Paços de Ferreira, Carlos Martins from Granada, Enzo Pérez from Estudiantes de La Plata, and Alan Kardec from Santos FC.

Ocean Village Marina, Gibraltar

The Ocean Village Marina is one of three marinas in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. Formerly Sheppard's Marina, it is located in the Bay of Gibraltar, between the North Mole of Gibraltar Harbour and the runway of Gibraltar International Airport. Both Ocean Village Marina and the adjacent Marina Bay have been incorporated into the Ocean Village Project, a luxury resort.
Ocean Village Marina and the adjacent Marina Bay together have 330 berths, with a draft (or draught) of . The marina can accommodate vessels up to to in length. There are three residential towers with blue glass balconies overlooking the marina: Grand Ocean Plaza, Imperial Plaza, and Majestic Plaza. On 4 June 2012, Ocean Village Marina hosted 161 vessels which formed the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla, celebrating sixty years of the Queen's reign.
Location.
Gibraltar has three marinas: Marina Bay, Ocean Village Marina, and Queensway Quay Marina. Ocean Village Marina is located on Gibraltar's Westside, outside the northern end of Gibraltar Harbour, in the Bay of Gibraltar, next to the airport runway. It is adjacent to Marina Bay which is just to its north. The marina forms part of the Ocean Village Project or Ocean Village Marina Complex, often referred to as just Ocean Village. Ocean Village Marina is the former Sheppard's Marina or Sheppard's Yard. Both Marina Bay and Ocean Village Marina have been incorporated into Ocean Village, between the North Mole and the airport runway. The strategic location of the marina offers protection from moisture-laden Levanter winds.
History.
Ocean Village Marina was formerly Sheppard's Marina, owned by H. Sheppard & Co. By 2004, the marina had been sold to Ocean Village Investments Ltd and demolition had commenced. The marina retained its original name, at least informally, for several years after the sale. The sale of Sheppard's Marina was not without controversy, as some residents of the marina were eventually evicted from their berths by the new owners. After Ocean Village Investments acquired the adjacent Marina Bay in 2006, both marinas were incorporated into Ocean Village, a resort with residential, retail, and leisure facilities.
On 4 June 2012, the Ocean Village Marina hosted 161 vessels which formed the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla, celebrating sixty years of the Queen's reign. The flotilla took place one day after a similar event in London up the Thames. The festivities started officially with greetings from Gregory Butcher, founder of Ocean Village, and Ros Astengo, event organiser of Ocean Village. The Gibraltar Port Authority addressed those assembled on the topic of safety, and made recommendations regarding precautions which ranged from sunscreen to the distance between vessels. The flotilla departed from the marina at midday, sailing from the western side of the runway, passing Europa Point, and returning after reaching the eastern side of the runway. Boats up to participated in the flotilla. Small boats led the flotilla, followed by power boats over , and, finally, sailing vessels. The "General Elliot", a Gibraltar Port Authority vessel, was at the head of the flotilla, and was supported by other official vessels.
Facilities.
Ocean Village Marina and the adjacent Marina Bay together have 330 berths, with a draft (or draught) of . The marina can accommodate vessels up to to in length. The marina now offers premier berths, the majority of which are between and , although the largest can accommodate vessels up to in length. The Yacht Reporting Berth for Gibraltar closed in 2005 and customs clearance of vessels is now performed by the individual marinas. Each berth at Ocean Village Marina offers utilities which include metered water and electricity, as well as access to satellite television, telephone, fax, and Wi-Fi. Other amenities include laundry and concierge services. Gasoline and diesel are available at the quayside.
In addition to the marina, the Ocean Village resort features three residential towers, with blue glass balconies, that also have commercial space: Grand Ocean Plaza, Imperial Plaza, and Majestic Plaza. Construction of a new World Trade Center in Ocean Village was scheduled to begin in 2012. The development has a variety of restaurants, bars, and retail outlets, as well as executive office space. Leisure Island, on reclaimed land, has a business centre and casino, among other facilities.
Sheppard's of Gibraltar, the former owner of the marina which was established in 1961, still has a presence there. The business provides support services for yacht owners from both their chandlery and shipyard departments. Their chandlery shop on the ground floor of Marina Court at Ocean Village has a variety of products for yacht equipment and maintenance. Their shipyard on Coaling Island near Queensway Quay Marina performs repair services such as engine rebuilds, rigging, welding, and painting. Sheppard's attends to yachts at all three of Gibraltar's marinas, and also has a 40 ton lift when haul-outs are needed. Their haul-out work includes hull cleaning, replacement of anodes or transducers, and slurry blasting, among other services. Haul-outs are performed at both Coaling Island and the North Mole.

Moses ben Mordecai Bassola (or simply: Moses Bassola, Altrenative spelling: Basilea, Basila, Bassola, Basola, Basla; Hebrew: רבי משה ברבי מרדכי באסולה or simply: משה באסולה; Alternative Hebrew spelling: באזלה,איש באזולה,ב(א)סולה, באסל,באזילא; born 1480 (year ה'ר"מ, Hebrew calendar), in Pesaro, Italy - died in 1560 (year ה'ש"כ, Hebrew calendar) ) was a Rabbi and a cabalist. His Travel book won wide popularity. It has been published in English and modern Hebrew by Abraham David under the titles In Zion and Jerusalem: The Itinerary of Rabbi Moses Basola (1521–1523). (Jerusalem: C. G. Foundation Jerusalem Project Publications, 1999. 148 pp. 48 pp. [Hebrew.)
Since he called himself "Ẓarfati" (the Frenchman), he may have originated from France.
R. Moses was the son of a famous rabbinical family in the Land of Israel and in Italy, living between the 15th century - 18th century. His last name - "Bassola" - shows that the family probably originated from Basel (the Latin form of the name is: "Basil") in Switzerland. Served in his youth in his hometown of Pesaro as a Rabbi. In 1521 he sailed to the Land of Israel via Cyprus and Crete and toured it for a year and a half. His impressions from this visit are documented in his book "Sefer masaot". The book became a rich source of description of the land of Israel, its attractions and people during those years and especially the Jewish community.
After returning to Italy R. Moses lived in Ancona and headed the Yeshiva there. In his later years R. Moses made Aliyah to the Land of Israel and setteled in Safed, where he was in a friendly relationship with the rabbis of the city, especially with R. Moses ben Jacob Cordovero. R. Moses' son, R. Azriel ben Moses Bassola, was a known scholar, whom among his students was R. Leon of Modena.

Israeli sculpture

Israeli sculpture designates sculpture produced in the Land of Israel from 1906, the year the "Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts" (today called the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design) was established. The process of crystallization of Israeli sculpture was influenced at every stage by international sculpture. In the early period of Israeli sculpture, most of its important sculptors were immigrants to the Land of Israel, and their art was a synthesis of the influence of European sculpture with the way in which the national artistic identity developed in the Land of Israel and later in the State of Israel.
Efforts toward the development of a local style of sculpture began in the late 1930s, with the creation of "Caananite" sculpture, which combined influences from European sculpture with motifs taken from the East, and particularly from Mesopotamia. These motifs were formulated in national terms and strived to present the relationship between Zionism and the soil of the homeland. In spite of the aspirations of abstract sculpture, which blossomed in Israel in the middle of the 20th century under the influence of the "New Horizons" movement and attempted to present sculpture that spoke a universal language, their art included many elements of earlier "Caananite" sculpture. In the 1970s, many new elements found their way into Israeli art and sculpture, under the influence of international conceptual art. These techniques significantly changed the definition of sculpture. In addition, these techniques facilitated the expression of political and social protest, which up to this time had been downplayed in Israeli sculpture.
History.
An attempt to find indigenous 19th century Israeli sources for the development of "Israeli" sculpture is problematic from two points of view. First, both the artists and Jewish society in the Land of Israel were lacking the national Zionist motifs which would accompany the development of Israeli sculpture in the future. This applies, of course, also to non-Jewish artists of the same period. Second, art history research has failed to find a tradition of sculpture either among the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel or among the Arab or Christian residents of that period. In research conducted by Yitzhak Einhorn, Haviva Peled, and Yona Fischer, artistic traditions of this period were identified, which include ornamental art of a religious (Jewish and Christian) nature, which was created for pilgrims and, therefore, for both export and local needs. These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, seals, etc. with motifs borrowed for the most part from the tradition of graphic art.
In his article "Sources of Israeli Sculpture" Gideon Ophrat identified the beginning of Israeli sculpture as the founding of the Bezalel School in 1906. At the same time he identified a problem in trying to present a unified picture of that sculpture. The reasons were the variety of European influences on Israeli sculpture, and the relatively small number of sculptors in Israel, most of whom had worked for long periods in Europe.
At the same time, even at the Bezalel – a school of art founded by a sculptor - sculpture was considered a lesser art, and the studies there concentrated on the art of painting and the crafts of graphic and design. Even in the "New Bezalel", founded in 1935, Sculpture did not occupy a significant place. While it's true that a department of sculpture was set up in the new school, it closed a year later, because it was viewed as a tool to help students learn three-dimensional design and not as an independent department. In its place a department of pottery opened and flourished. There were exhibitions by individual sculptors during these years both in the Bezalel Museum and in the Tel Aviv Museum, but these were exceptions and were not indicative of the general attitude toward three-dimensional art. An ambiguous attitude toward sculpture by the artistic establishment could be felt, in various incarnations, well into the 1960s.
Early Land of Israel sculpture.
The beginning of sculpture in the Land of Israel, and of Israeli art in general, is usually designated as 1906, the year of the founding of the Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts in Jerusalem by Boris Schatz. Schatz, who studied sculpture in Paris with Mark Antokolski, was already a well-known sculptor when he arrived in Jerusalem. He specialized in relief portraiture of Jewish subjects in an academic style.
Schatz's work attempted to establish a new Jewish-Zionist identity He expressed this by using figures from the Bible within a framework derived from European Christian culture. His work "Matthew the Hasmoneum" (1894), for example, depicted the Jewish national hero Mattathias ben Johanan grasping a sword and with his foot on the body of a Greek soldier. This kind of representation is connected to the ideological theme of "The Victory of Good Over Evil", as expressed, for example, in the figure of Perseus in a sculpture from the 15th century. Even a series of memorial plaques Schatz created for the leaders of the Jewish settlement is derived from Classical art, combined with the descriptive tradition in the spirit of the Ars Novo tradition. The influence of Classical and Renaissance art on Schatz can be seen even in the copies of sculptures he ordered for Bezalel, which he displayed in the Bezalel Museum as examples of ideal sculpture for the students in the school. These sculptures include "David" (1473–1475) and "Putto with a Dolphin" (1470) by Andrea del Verrocchio.
The studies at Bezalel tended to favor painting, drawing, and design, and as a result the amount of three-dimensional sculpture turned out there was limited. Among the few workshops which opened at the school was one in woodcarving, in which reliefs of various Zionist and Jewish leaders were produced, along with workshops in decorative design in applied art using techniques such as hammering copper into thin sheets, setting gems, etc. In 1912 a department for ivory design, which also emphasized the applied arts, was opened. In the course of its activities workshops were added that functioned nearly autonomously. In a memo issued in June 1924, Schatz outlined all of the major fields of activity of Bezalel, among them stone sculpture, which was founded primarily by students of the school within the framework of the "Jewish Legion" and the workshop on woodcarving.
Besides Schatz, there were several other artists in Jerusalem in the early days of Bezalel who were working in the field of sculpture. In 1912 Ze'ev Raban immigrated to the Land of Israel at Schatz's invitation and served as an instructor in sculpture, sheet copper work, and anatomy at Bezalel. Raban had trained in sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and later at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, Belgium. In addition to his well-known graphic work, Raban created figurative sculptures and reliefs in the academic "Oriental" style, such as the terracotta figurine of the Biblical figures "Eli and Samuel" (1914), who are depicted as Yemenite Jews. However Raban's most important work focused on embossments for jewelry and other decorative items.
Other instructors at Bezalel also created sculptures in the realistic academic style. Eliezer Strich, for instance, created busts of people in the Jewish settlement. Another artist, Yitzhak Sirkin carved portraits in wood and in stone.
The main contribution to Israel sculpture of this period can be contributed to Abraham Melnikoff, who worked outside the framework of Bezalel. Melnikoff created his first work in Israel in 1919, after he arrived in the Land of Israel during his service in the "Jewish Legion". Until the 1930s, Melnikoff produced a series of sculptures in various kinds of stone, mostly portraiture done in terracotta and stylized images carved out of stone. Among his significant works is a group of symbolic sculptures depicting the awakening of the Jewish identity, such as "The Awakening Judah" (1925), or memorial monuments to Ahad Ha'am (1928) and to Max Nordau (1928). In addition, Melnikoff presided over presentations of his works in exhibits of Artists of the Land of Israel in the Tower of David.
The "Roaring Lion" monument (1928-1932) is a continuation of this trend, but this sculpture is different in the way it was perceived by the Jewish public of that period. Melnikoff himself initiated the building of the monument, and funding for the project was attained jointly by the Histadrut ha-Clalit, the Jewish National Council, and Alfred Mond (Lord Melchett). The image of the monumental lion, sculpted in granite, was influenced by primitive art combined with Mesopotamian art of the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. The style is expressed primarily in the anatomical design of the figure.
The sculptors who started to produce works at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s in the Land of Israel demonstrated a wide variety of influences and styles. Among them were a few who went by the teachings of the Bezalel School, while others, who arrived after studying in Europe, brought with them the influence of early French Modernism on art, or the influence of Expressionism, especially in its German form.
Among the sculptors who were Bezalel students, the works of Aaron Priver stand out. Priver arrived in the Land of Israel in 1926 and began to study sculpture with Melnikoff. His work displayed a combination of a tendency toward realism and an archaic or moderately primitive style. His feminine figures of the 1930s are designed with rounded lines and sketchy facial features. Another pupil, Nachum Gutman, better known for his paintings and drawings, traveled to Vienna in 1920, and later went to Berlin and Paris, where he studied sculpture and printmaking and produced sculptures on a small scale which show traces of expressionism and a tendency toward a "primitive" style in the depiction of its subjects.
The works of David Ozeransky (Agam) continued the decorative tradition of Ze'ev Raban. Ozeransky even worked as a laborer on the sculptural decorations Raban created for the YMCA building in Jerusalem. Ozeransky's most important work of this period is "Ten Tribes" (1932) - a group of ten square decorative tablets, which describe in symbolic terms the ten cultures associated with the history of the Land of Israel. Another work that Ozeranzky was involved in creating during this period was "The Lion" (1935) that stands atop the Generali Building in Jerusalem.
Although he was never a student at the institution, the work of David Polus was anchored in the Jewish academism which Schatz formulated at Bezalel. Polus began to sculpt after he was a stonemason in the labor corps. His first significant work was a statue of "David the Shepherd" (1936-1938) in Ramat David. In his monumental work 1940 "Alexander Zeid Memorial", which was cast in concrete at "Sheik Abreik" and stands near the Beit She'arim National Park, Polus represents the man known as "The Watchman" as a horseman looking out over the view of the Jezreel Valley. In 1940 Polus placed at the base of the monument two tablets, in archaic-symbolic style, whose subjects were "the thicket" and "the shepherd." While the style of the main statue is realistic, it became known for its attempt to glorify its subject and emphasize his connection with the land.
In 1910 the sculptress Chana Orloff emigrated from the Land of Israel to France and began studies in the École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs. Her work, beginning with the period of her studies, emphasizes her connection to French art of the time. Particularly evident is the influence of Cubist sculpture, which moderated in her work with the passage of time. Her sculptures, mostly human images carved in stone and wood, designed as geometric spaces and flowing lines. A significant portion of her work is devoted to sculptural portraits of figures from French society. Her connection with the Land of Israel, Orloff preserved through an exhibition of her works in the Tel Aviv Museum.
Another sculptor who was greatly influenced by Cubism is Zeev Ben Zvi. In 1928, after his studies in Bezalel, Ben Zvi went to study in Paris. Upon his return he served for short periods as an instructor in sculpture at Bezalel and at the "New Bezalel." In 1932 his first exhibition was held at the Bezalel national antiquities museum, and a year later he mounted an exhibition of his works at the Tel Aviv Museum. His sculpture "The Pioneer" was displayed at the Orient Fair in Tel Aviv in 1934. In Ben Zvi's work, as in Orloff's, the language of the Cubists, the language in which he designed his sculptures, did not abandon realism and stayed within the boundaries of traditional sculpture.
The influence of French realism can also be seen in the group of Israeli artists who were influenced by the realistic trend of early twentieth-century French sculptors like Auguste Rodin, Aristide Maillol, etc. The symbolic baggage of both their content and their style showed up as well in the work of Israeli artists, such as Moses Sternschuss, Raphael Chamizer, Moshe Ziffer, Joseph Constant (Constantinovsky), and Dov Feigin, most of whom studied sculpture in France.
One of this group of artists – Batya Lishanski – studied painting in Bezalel, and took courses in sculpture in the Parisian École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. When she returned to Israel, she created figurative and expressive sculpture, which showed the clear influence of Rodin, who emphasized the corporeality of his sculptures. The series of monuments that Lishanski created, the first of which was "Labor and Defense" (1929), which was built over the grave of Ephraim Chisik - who died in the battle for the Hulda Farm (today, Kibbutz Hulda) - as a reflection of the Zionist utopia during that period: a combination of the redemption of the land and the defense of the homeland.
The influence of German art and particularly of German expressionism can be seen in the group of artists who arrived in the Land of Israel after receiving their training in art in various German cities and in Vienna. Artists such as Yaacov Brandenburg, Trude Chaim, and Lili Gompretz-Beatus, and George Leshnitzer produced figurative sculpture, primarily portraiture, designed in a style that wavered between impressionism and moderate expressionism. Among the artists of that group Rudolof (Rudi) Lehmann, who started teaching art in a studio he opened in the 1930s, stands out. Lehmann had studied sculpture and wood carving with a German named L. Feurdermeier, who specialized in animal sculptures. The figures that Lehmann created showed the influence of expressionism in the gross design of the body, which emphasized the material from which the sculpture was made and the way the sculptor worked on it. In spite of the overall appreciation of his work, Lehmann's primary importance was as a teacher of the methods of classical sculpture, in stone and wood, to a large number of Israeli artists.
Caananite to Abstract, 1939-1967.
At the end of the 1930s, a group called "The Caananites" - a broad sculptural movement, primarily literary in nature - was founded in Israel. This group tried to create a direct line between the early peoples living in the Land of Israel, in the second millennium before the Christian Era, and the Jewish people in the Land of Israel in the 20th century, at the same time striving toward the creation of a new-old culture which would separate itself from Jewish tradition. The artist most closely associated with this movement was the sculptor Itzhak Danziger, who returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying art in England. The new nationalism that Danziger's "Caananite" art suggested, a nationalism that was anti-European and full of Eastern sensuality and exoticism, reflected the attitude of many of the people living in the Jewish community in the Land of Israel. "The dream of Danziger's generation", Amos Keinan wrote after Danziger's death, was "to merge with the Land of Israel and with the land, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and imprint the stamp of that something special that is us on history. Aside from nationalism, the artists created sculpture which expressed a symbolic expressionism in the spirit of British sculpture of the same period.
In Tel Aviv Danziger founded a sculpture studio in the courtyard of his father's hospital, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as Benjamin Tammuz, Kosso Eloul, Yehiel Shemi, Mordechai Gumpel, and others. In addition to Danziger's pupils, the studio became a gathering place for artists in other fields. In this studio Danziger created his first significant works – "Nimrod" (1939) and "Shebaziya" (1939).
From the moment it was first displayed, the statue "Nimrod" became the center of a dispute in the culture of Eretz Israel; in this sculpture Danziger presented the figure of Nimrod, the biblical hunter, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, with a sword to pressed close to his body, and a falcon on his shoulder. The form of the statue was reminiscent of the primitive art of the Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek cultures, and similar in spirit to European sculpture of this period. In its form the statue displayed a unique combination of homoerotic beauty and pagan idol worship. This combination was at the center of the criticism of the religious community in the Jewish settlement. At the same time other voices declared it the model for the 'new Jewish man'. In 1942 an article appeared in the newspaper "HaBoker" declaring that "Nimrod is not just a sculpture, it is the flesh of our flesh, the spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and a monument. It is the epitome of ingenuity and daring, of monumentality, of the youthful rebellion that characterizes an entire generation…Nimrod will be forever young."
The first showing of the sculpture in the "General Exhibition of the Young People of Eretz Israel", in Habima Theatre in May, 1942 engendered the persistent argument around the "Caananite" movement. Because of the exhibition, Yonatan Ratosh, founder of the movement, got in touch with him and requested a meeting with him. The criticism against "Nimrod" and the Caananites was coming not just from religious elements who, as mentioned above, protested against this representative of the pagan and the idolatrous, but also from secular critics who condemned the removal of everything "Jewish". To a large extent, "Nimrod" ended up in the middle of a dispute that had been started long before.
In spite of the fact that Danziger later expressed doubts about "Nimrod" as a model for Israeli culture, many other artists adopted the Caananite approach to sculpture. Images of idols and figures in the "primitive" style showed up in Israeli art until the 1970s. In addition, the influence of this group can be seen to a significant degree in the work of the "New Horizons" group, most of whose members experimented with the Caananite style early in their artistic careers.
"New Horizons" Group.
In 1948, a movement called "New Horizons" ("Ofakim Hadasim") was founded. It identified with the values of European modernism, and particularly with abstract art. Kosso Eloul, Moshe Sternschuss, and Dov Feigin were appointed to the group of founders of the movement, and were later joined by other sculptors. The Israeli sculptors were perceived as a minority not only because of the small number of them in the movement, but primarily because of the dominance of the medium of painting in the view of the leaders of the movement, especially Joseph Zaritsky. In spite of the fact that most of the sculptures of members of the group were not "pure" abstract sculpture, they included elements of abstract art and metaphysical symbolism. Non-abstract art was perceived as old-fashioned and irrelevant. Sternschuss, for example, described the pressure that was put upon members of the group not to include figurative elements in their art. It was a long struggle that began in 1959, the year that was considered by members of the group as the year of "the victory of abstraction" and reached its peak in the mid-1960s. Sternschuss even told a story about an incident in which one of the artists wanted to display a sculpture that was considerably more avante-garde than what was generally accepted. But it had a head, and because of this, one of the members of the board testified against him on this issue.
Gideon Ophrat, in his essay on the group, found a strong connection between the painting and sculpture of "New Horizons" and the art of the "Caananites." In spite of the "international" hue of the artistic forms that the members of the group exhibited, many of their works showed a mythological depiction of the Israeli landscape. In December 1962, for example, Kosso Eloul organized an international symposium on sculpture in Mitzpe Ramon. This event served as an example of the growing interest of the sculptures in the Israeli landscape, and in particular in the desolate desert landscape. The landscape was perceived, on the one hand, as the basis for the thought processes for creating many monuments and memorial sculptures. Yona Fisher speculated, in his research on art in the 1960s, that the interest of sculptors in the "magic of the desert" arose not just from a romantic yearning for nature, but also from an attempt to inculcate in Israel an environment of "Culture" rather than "Civilization".
The test with regard to the works of each member of the group lay in the different way he dealt with abstraction and with landscape. The crystallization of the abstract nature of Dov Feigin's sculpture, was part of a process of an artistic search that was influenced by international sculpture, particularly that of Julio González, Constantin Brâncuși, and Alexander Calder. The most important artistic change took place in 1956, when Feigin changed over to metal (iron) sculpture. His works from this year onward, such as "Bird" and "Flight" were constructed by welding together strips of iron which were placed in compositions full of dynamism and movement. The transition from linear sculpture to planar sculpture, using cut and bent copper or iron, was a process of natural development for Feigin, who was influenced by the works of Pablo Picasso done using a similar technique.
In contrast to Feigin, Moshe Sternschuss shows a more gradual development in his move toward abstraction. After finishing his studies at Bezalel, Sternschuss went to study in Paris. In 1934 he returned to Tel Aviv and was among the founders of the Avni Institute ofArt and Design. Sternschuss' sculptures during that period displayed an academic modernism, although they were lacking the Zionist features present in art of the Bezalel School. Beginning in the middle of the 1940s, his human figures displayed a marked tendency toward abstraction, as well as a growing use of geometric forms. One of the first of these sculptures was "Dance" (1944), which was displayed in an exhibition next to "Nimrod" in this year. Actually, Sternschuss' work never became completely abstract, but continued to deal with the human figure by non-figurative means.
When Itzhak Danziger returned to Israel in 1955, he joined "New Horizons" and began making metal sculptures. The style of the sculptures he developed was influenced by constructivist art, which was expressed in its abstract forms. Nonetheless, much of the subject matter of his sculptures was clearly local, as in sculptures with names associated with the Bible, such as "Horns of Hattin" (1956), the place of Saladin's victory over the crusaders in 1187, and The Burning Bush (1957), or with places in Israel, such as "Ein Gedi" (1950s), "Sheep of the Negev" (1963), etc. To a considerable extent this combination characterized the works of many of the artists of the movement.
Yechiel Shemi, also one of Danziger's pupils, moved to metal sculpture in 1955 for a practical reason. This move facilitated the move to abstraction in his work. His works, which made use of the technique of soldering, welding, and hammering into thin strips, was one of the first sculptors from this group that worked with these techniques.26 In works such as "Mythos" (1956) Shemi's connection with the "Caananite" art from which he developed can still be seen, but soon after he eliminated all identifiable signs of figurative art from his work.
Israeli-born Ruth Tzarfati studied sculpture in Avni's studio with Moses Sternschuss, who became her husband. In spite of the stylistic and social closeness between Zarfati and the "New Horizons" artists, her sculpture shows overtones that are independent from the rest of the members of the group. This is expressed primarily in her display of figurative sculpture with curved lines. Her sculpture "She Sits" (1953), depicts an unidentified female figure, using lines characteristics of European expressive sculpture, such as the sculpture of Henry Moore. Another group of sculpture, "Baby Girl" (1959) shows a group of children and babies designed as dolls in grotesque expressive poses.
Sculpture of Protest.
In the early 1960s, American influences, particularly abstract expressionism, pop art, and somewhat later, conceptual art, began to appear in Israeli art. In addition to new artistic forms, pop art and conceptual art brought with them a direct connection to the political and social realities of the time. In contrast, the central trend in Israeli art was towards a preoccupation with the personal and the artistic, ignoring to a large extent a discussion of the Israeli political landscape. Artists who concerned themselves with social or Jewish issues were looked on by the artistic establishment as anarchists.
One of the first artists whose works expressed not only international artistic influences, but also the tendency to deal with current political issues, was Yigal Tumarkin, who returned to Israel in 1961, at the encouragement of Yona Fischer and Sam Dubiner, from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of Berthold Brecht. His early sculptures were created as expressive assemblages, put together from parts of various kinds of weapons. His sculpture "Take Me Under Your Wings"(1964–65), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The mixture that we see in this sculpture of the nationalistic dimension and the lyric, and even erotic, dimension, was to become a striking element in Tumarkin's political art in the 1970s. A similar approach can be seen in his famous sculpture "He Walked in the Fields" (1967) (the same name as Moshe Shamir's famous story), which protested against the image of the "mythological Sabra"; Tumarkin strips off his "skin" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by "Land art," such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth. In this way Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.
After the Six-Day War Israeli art began to demonstrate other expressions of protest than those of Tumarkin. At the same time, these works did not look like conventional works of sculpture, made of wood or metal. The main reason for this was the influence of various kinds of avant-garde art, which developed for the most part in the United States and influenced young Israeli artists. The spirit of this influence could be seen in a tendency toward active artistic works that blurred both the boundaries between the different fields of art and the separation of the artist from social and political life. The sculpture of this period was no longer perceived as an independent artistic object, but rather as an inherent expression of physical and social space.
Landscape Sculpture in Conceptual Art.
Another aspect of these trends was the growing interest in the boundless Israeli landscape. These works were influenced by Land Art and a combination of the dialectical relationship between the "Israeli" landscape and the "Eastern" landscape. In many works with ritualistic and metaphysical traits, the development or direct influence of the Caananite artists or sculptors can be seen, along with the abstraction of "New Horizons", in the various relationships with the landscape.
One of the first projects in Israel under the banner of conceptual art was carried out by Joshua Neustein. In 1970 Neustein, collaborated with Georgette Batlle and Gerry Marx on "Jerusalem River Project". For this project speakers installed across a desert valley played looped sounds of a river in East Jerusalem, in the foothills of Abu Tor and Saint Claire's Convent, and all the way to the Kidron Valley. This imaginary river not only created an extraterritorial museum atmosphere, but also hinted in an ironic way at the feeling of messianic redemption after the Six Day War, in the spirit of the Book of Ezekiel (Chapter 47) and the Book of Zechariah (Chapter 14).
Yitzhak Danziger, whose works had begun portraying the local landscape several years earlier, expressed the conceptual aspect in a style he developed as a distinctive Israeli variation of Land Art. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. In 1971, Danziger presented his project "Hanging Nature", in a collaborative project in The Israel Museum. The work was composed of hanging fabric on which was a mixture of colors, plastic emulsion, cellulose fibers, and chemical fertilizer, on which Danziger was growing grass using a system of artificial light and irrigation. Next to the fabric, slides showing the destruction of nature by modern industrialization were screened. The exhibition requested the creation of an ecology unity, which would exist as "art" and as "nature" simultaneously. The "repair" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project "The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry", on the northern slopes of Mount Carmel. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, Zeev Naveh the ecologist, and Joseph Morin the soil researcher. In this project, which was never finished, they attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry. "Nature should not be returned to its natural state," Danziger contended. "A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept." After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.
In 1973 Danziger began to collect material for a book that would document his work. Within the framework of the preparation for the book, he documented places of archaeological and contemporary ritual in Israel, places which had become the sources of inspiration for his work. The book, "Makom" (in Hebrew - Place), was published in 1982, after Danziger's death, and presented photographs of these places along with Danziger's sculptures, exercises in design, sketches of his works and ecological ideas, displayed as "sculpture" with the values of abstract art, such as collecting rainwater, etc. One of the places documented in the book is Bustan Hayat not confirm English spelling-sl at Nachal Siach in Haifa, which was built by Aziz Hayat in 1936. Within the framework of classes he gave at the Technion, Danziger conducted experiments in design with his students, involving them also with the care and upkeep of the Bustan.
In 1977 a planting ceremony was conducted in the Golan Heights for 350 Oak saplings, being planted as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the Egoz Unit. Danziger, who was serving as a judge in "the competition for the planning and implementation of the memorial to the Northern Commando Unit," suggested that instead of a memorial sculpture, they put their emphasis on the landscape itself, and on a site that would be different from the usual memorial. ”We felt that any vertical structure, even the most impressive, could not compete with the mountain range itself. When we started climbing up to the site, we discovered that the rocks, that looked from a distance like texture, had a personality all of their own up close." This perception derived from research in Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites in the Land of Israel, sites in which the trees serve both as a symbol next to the graves of saints and as a ritual focus, "on which they hang colorful shiny blue and green fabrics from the oaks […] People go out to hang these fabrics because of a spiritual need, they go out to make a wish."
In 1972 group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as "Metzer-Messer" in the area between Kibbutz Metzer and the Arab village Meiser in the north west section of the Shomron. Micha Ullman, with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. Moshe Gershuni called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and Avital Geva created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.
Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was Yigal Tumarkin, who at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, "Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks," in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using "impoverished" bricolage methods. Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture. In works such as "Earth Crucifixion" (1981) and "Bedouin Crucifixion" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created "crucifixion pillars" for these lands.
Another group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the "Leviathians," presided over by Avraham Ofek, Michail Grobman, and Shmuel Ackerman. The group combined conceptual art and "land art" with Jewish symbolism. Of the three of them Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images. In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures. In his work "Letters of Light" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert. In another work Ofek screened the words "America," "Africa," and "Green card" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.
Abstract Sculpture.
At the beginning of the 1960s Menashe Kadishman arrived on the scene of abstract sculpture while he was studying in London. The artistic style he developed in those years was heavily influenced by English art of this period, such as the works of Anthony Caro, who was one of his teachers. At the same time his work was permeated by the relationship between landscape and ritual objects, like Danziger and other Israeli sculptors. During his stay in Europe, Kadishman created a number of totemic images of people, gates, and altars of a talismanic and primitive nature. Some of these works, such as "Suspense" (1966), or "Uprise" (1967-1976), developed into pure geometric figures.
At the end of this decade, in works such as "Aqueduct" (1968-1970) or "Segments" (1969), Kadishman combined pieces of glass separating chunks of stone with a tension of form between the different parts of the sculpture. With his return to Israel at the beginning of the 1970s, Kadishman began to create works that were clearly in the spirit of "Land Art." One of his main projects was carried out in 1972. In the framework of this project Kadishman painted a square in yellow organic paint on the land of the Monastery of the Cross, in the Valley of the Cross at the foot of the Israel Museum . The work became known as a "monument of global nature, in which the landscape depicted by it is both the subject and the object of the creative process."
Other Israeli artists also created abstract sculptures charged with symbolism. The sculptures of Michael Gross created an abstraction of the Israeli landscape, while those of Yaacov Agam contained a Jewish theological aspect. His work was also innovative in its attempt to create kinetic art. Works of his such as "18 Degrees" (1971) not only eroded the boundary between the work and the viewer of the work, but also exhorted the viewer to look at the work actively.
Symbolism of a different kind can be seen in the work of Dani Karavan. The outdoor sculptures that Karavan created, from "Monument to the Negev Brigade" (1963-1968) to "White Square" (1989) utilized avant-garde European art to create a symbolic abstraction of the Israeli landscape. In Karavan's use of the techniques of modernist, and primarily brutalist, architecture, as in his museum installations, Karavan created a sort of alternative environment to landscapes, redesigning it as a utopia, or as a call for a dialogue with these landscapes.
Micha Ullman continued and developed the concept of nature and the structure of the excavations he carried out on systems of underground structures formulated according to a minimalist esthetic. These structures, like the work "Third Watch" (1980), which are presented as defense trenches made of dirt, are also presented as the place which housed the beginning of permanent human existence.
Buky Schwartz absorbed concepts from conceptual art, primarily of the American variety, during the period that he lived in New York. Schwartz's work dealt with the way the relationship between the viewer and the work of art is constructed and deconstructed. In the video art film "Video Structures" (1978-1980) Schwartz demonstrated the dismantling of the geometric illusion using optical methods, that is, marking an illusory form in space and then dismantling this illusion when the human body is interposed. In sculptures such as "Levitation" (1976) or "Reflection Triangle" (1980), Schwartz dismantled the serious geometry of his sculptures by inserting mirrors that produced the illusion that they were floating in the air, similarly to Kadishman's works in glass.
Representative Sculpture of the 1970s.
Performance Art began to develop in the United States in the 1960s, trickling into Israeli art towards the end of that decade under the auspices of the "Ten Plus" group, led by Raffi Lavie and the "Third Eye" group, under the leadership of Jacques Cathmore. A large number of sculptors took advantage of the possibilities that the techniques of Performance Art opened for them with regard to a critical examination of the space around them. In spite of the fact that many works renounced the need for genuine physical expression, nevertheless the examination they carry out shows the clear way in which the artists related to physical space from the point of view of social, political, and gender issues.
Pinchas Cohen Gan during those years created a number of displays of a political nature. In his work "Touching the Border" (January 7, 1974) iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In "Performance in a Refugees Camp in Jericho", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of Jericho near Khirbat al-Mafjar (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time Cohen Gan set up a conversation about "Israel 25 Years Hence", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, "A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland."
Another artist, Efrat Natan, created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six Day War. Among her important works was "Head Sculpture," in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter "T," bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision."
A blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work "A Gentle Hand" (1975-1978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by Zalman Shneur (called: "All Her Heart She Gave Him" and the first words of which are "A gentle hand", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the Second Aliyah (1904-1914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In works like these the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society. 
The works of Gideon Gechtman during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life. In the exhibition "Exposure" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as "Brushes" (1974–1975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.
Another major work of Gechtman's during this period was exhibited in the exhibition entitled "Open Workshop" (1975) at the Israel Museum. The exhibition summarized the sociopolitical "activity" known as "Jewish Work" and, within this framework," Gechtman participated as a construction worker in the building of a new wing of the Museum and lived within the exhibition space. on the construction site. Gechtman also hung obituaries bearing the name "Jewish Work" and a photograph of the homes of Arab workers on the construction site. In spite of the clearly political aspects of this work, its complex relationship to the image of the artist in society is also evident.
1980s and 1990s.
In the 1980s, influences from the international postmodern discourse began to trickle into Israeli art. Particularly important was the influence of philosophers such as Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard, who formulated the concept of the semantic and relative nature of reality in their philosophical writings. The idea that the artistic representation is composed of "simulacra", objects in which the internal relation between the signifier and the signified is not direct, created a feeling that the status of the artistic object in general, and of sculpture in particular, was being undermined.
Gideon Gechtman's work expresses the transition from the conceptual approach of the 1970s to the 1980s, when new strategies were adopted that took real object s (death notices, a hospital, a child's wagon) and gradually converted them into objects of art. The real objects were recreated in various artificial materials. Death notices, for example, were made out of colored neon lights, like those used in advertisements. Other materials Gechtman used in this period were formica and imitation marble, which in themselves emphasized the artificiality of the artistic representation and its non-biographical nature.
During the 1980s, the works of a number of sculptors were known for their use of plywood. The use of this material served to emphasize the way large-scale objects were constructed, often within the tradition of do-it-yourself carpentry. The concept behind this kind of sculpture emphasized the non-heroic nature of a work of art, related to the "Arte Povera" style, which was at the height of its influence during these years. Among the most conspicuous of the artists who first used these methods is Nahum Tevet, who began his career in the 1970s as a sculptor in the minimalist and conceptual style. While in the early 1970s he used a severe, nearly monastic, style in his works, from the beginning the 1980s he began to construct works that were more and more complex, composed of disassembled parts, built in home-based workshops. The works are described as "a trap configuration, which seduces the eye into penetrating the content […] but is revealed as a false temptation that blocks the way rather than leading somewhere." The group of sculptors who called themselves "Drawing Lessons," from the middle of the decade, and other works, such as "Ursa Major (with eclipse)" (1984) and "Jemmain" (1986) created a variety of points of view, disorder, and spatial disorientation, which "demonstrate the subject's loss of stability in the postmodernist world."
The sculptures of Drora Domini as well dealt with the construction and deconstruction of structures with a domestic connection. Many of them featured disassembled images of furniture. The abstract structures she built, on a relatively small scale, contained absurd connections between them. Towards the end of the decade Domini began to combine additional images in her works from compositions in the "ars poetica" style. 
Another artist who created wooden structures was the sculptor Isaac Golombek. His works from the end of the decade included familiar objects reconstructed from plywood and with their natural proportions distorted. The items he produced had structures one on top of another. Itamar Levy, in his article "High Low Profile" katan godol, describes the relationship between the viewer and Golombek's works as an experiment in the separation of the sense of sight from the senses of touching and feeling. The bodies that Golombek describes are dismantled bodies, conducting a protest dialogue against the gaze of the viewer, who aspires to determine one unique, protected, and explainable identity for the work of art. While the form of the object represents a clear identity, the way they are made distances the usefulness of the objects and disrupts the feeling of materiality of the items.
A different kind of construction can be seen in the performances of the Zik Group, which came into being in the middle of the 1980s. Within the framework of its performances, the Group built large-scale wooden sculptures and created ritualistic activities around themselves, combining a variety of artistic techniques. When the performance ended, they set fire to the sculpture in a public burning ceremony. In the 1990s, in addition to destruction, the group also took began to focus on the transformation of materials and did away with the public burning ceremonies.
Postmodern Trends.
Another effect of the postmodern approach was the protest against historical and cultural narratives. Art was not yet perceived as ideology, supporting or opposing the discourse on Israeli hegemony, but rather as the basis for a more open and pluralistic discussion of reality. In the era following the "political revolution" which resulted from the 1977 election, this was expressed in the establishment of the "identity discussion," in which parts of society that up to now had not usually been represented in the main Israeli discourse were included. 
In the beginning of the 1980s expressions of the trauma of the Holocaust began to appear in Israeli society. In the works of the "second generation" there began to appear figures taken from World War II, combined with an attempt to establish a personal identity as an Israeli and as a Jew. Among the pioneering works were Moshe Gershuni's installation "Red Sealing/Theatre" (1980) and the works of Haim Maor. These expressions became more and more explicit in the 1990s. A large group of works was created by Igael Tumarkin, who combined in his monumental creations dialectical images representing the horrors of the Holocaust with the world of European culture in which it occurred. The artist Penny Yassour, for example, represented the Holocaust in a series of structures and models in which hints and quotes referring to the war appear. In the work "Screens" (1996), which was displayed at the "Documenta" exhibition, Yassour created a map of German trains in 1938 in the form of a table made out of rubber, as part of an experiment to present the memory and describe the relationship between private and public memory. The other materials Yassour used – metal and wood that created different architectonic spaces – produced an atmosphere of isolation and horror. 
Another aspect of raising the memory of the Holocaust to the public consciousness was the focus on the immigrants who came to Israel during the first decades after the founding of the State. These attempts were accompanied by a protest against the image of the Israeli "Sabra" and an emphasis on the feeling of detachment of the immigrants. The sculptor Philip Rentzer presented, in a number of works and installations, the image of the immigrant and the refugee in Israel. His works, constructed from an assemblage of various ready-made materials, show the contrast between the permanence of the domestic and the feeling of impermanence of the immigrant. In his installation "The Box from Nes Ziona" (1998), Rentzer created an Orientalist camel carrying on its back the immigrants' shack of Rentzer's family, represented by skeletons carrying ladders.
In addition to expressions of the Holocaust, a growing expression of the motifs of Jewish art can be seen in Israeli art of the 1990s. In spite of the fact that motifs of this kind could be seen in the past in art of such artists as Arie Aroch, Moshe Castel, and Mordechai Ardon, the works of Israeli artists of the 1990s displayed a more direct relationship to the world of Jewish symbols. One of the most visible of the artists who used these motifs, Belu Simion Fainaru used Hebrew letters and other symbols as the basis for the creation of objects with metaphysical-religious significance. In his work "Sham" ("There" in Hebrew) (1996), for example, Fainaru created a closed structure, with windows in the form of the Hebrew letter Shin (ש). In another work, he made a model of a synagogue (1997), with windows in the shape of the letters, Aleph (א) to Zayin (ז) - one to seven - representing the seven days of the creation of the world.
During the 1990s we also begin to see various representations of Gender and sexual motifs. Sigal Primor exhibited works that dealt with the image of women in Western culture. In an environmental sculpture she placed on Sderot Chen in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Primor created a replica of furniture made of stainless steel. In this way, the structure points out the gap between personal, private space and public space. In many of Primor's works there is an ironic relationship to the motif of the "bride", as seen Marcel Duchamp's work, "The Glass Door". In her work "The Bride", materials such as cast iron, combined with images using other techniques such as photography, become objects of desire.
In her installation "Dinner Dress (Tales About Dora)" (1997), Tamar Raban turned a dining room table four meters in diameter into a huge crinoline and she organized an installation that took place both on top of and under the dining room table. The public was invited to participate in the meal prepared by chef Tsachi Bukshester and watch what was going on under the table on monitors placed under the transparent glass dinner plates. The installation raises questions about the perceptions of memory and personal identity in a variety of ways. During the performance, Raban would tell stories about "Dora," Raban's mother 's name, with reference to the figure "Dora" – a nickname for Ida Bauer, one of the historic patients of Sigmund Freud. In the corner of the room was the artist Pnina Reichman, embroidering words and letters in English, such as "all those lost words" and "contaminated memory," and counting in Yiddish.
The centrality of the gender discussion in the international cultural and art scene had an influence on Israeli artists. In the video art works of Hila Lulu Lin, the protest against the traditional concepts of women's sexuality stood out. In her work "No More Tears" (1994), Lulu Lin appeared passing an egg yolk back and forth between her hand and her mouth. Other artists sought not only to express in their art homoeroticism and feelings of horror and death, but also to test the social legitimacy of homosexuality and lesbianism in Israel. Among these artists the creative team of Nir Nader and Erez Harodi, and the performance artist Dan Zakheim stand out.
As the world of Israeli art was exposed to the art of the rest of the world, especially from the 1990s, a striving toward the "total visual experience," expressed in large-scale installations and in the use of theatrical technologies, particularly of video art, can be seen in the works of many Israeli artists. The subject of many of these installations is a critical test of space. Among these artists can be found Ohad Meromi and Michal Rovner, who creates video installations in which human activities are converted into ornamental designs of texts. In the works of Uri Tzaig the use of video to test the activity of the viewer as a critical activity stands out. In "Universal Square" (2006), for example, Tzaig created a video art film in which two footballs teams compete on a field with two balls. The change in the regular rules created a variety of opportunities for the players to come up with new plays on the space of the football field.
Another well-known artist who creates large-scale installations is Sigalit Landau. Landau creates expressive environments with multiple sculptures laden with political and social allegorical significance. The apocalyptic exhibitions Landau mounted, such as "The Country" (2002) or "Endless Solution" (2005), succeeded in reaching large and varied segments of the population.
Commemorative Sculpture.
In Israel there are many memorial sculptures whose purpose is to perpetuate the memory of various events in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Since the memorial sculptures are displayed in public spaces, they tend to serve as an expression of popular art of the period. The first memorial sculpture erected in the Land of Israel was “The Roaring Lion”, which Abraham Melnikoff sculpted in Tel Hai. The large proportions of the statue and the public funding that Melnikoff recruited towards its construction, was an innovation for the small Israeli art scene. From a sculptural standpoint, the statue was connected to the beginnings of the “Caananite” movement in art.
The memorial sculptures erected in Israel up to the beginning of the 1950s, most of which were memorials for the fallen soldiers of the War of Independence, were characterized for the most part by their figurative subjects and elegiac overtones, which were aimed at the emotions of the Zionist Israeli public. The structure of the memorials was designed as spacial theater. The accepted model for the memorial included a wall with a wall covered in stone or marble, the back of which remained unused. On it, the names of the fallen soldiers were engraved. Alongside of this was a relief of a wounded soldier or an allegorical description, such as descriptions of lions. A number of memorial sculptures were erected as the central structure on a ceremonial surface meant to be viewed from all sides.
In the design of these memorial sculptures we can see significant differences among the accepted patterns of memory of that period. Hashomer Hatzair (The Youth Guard) kibbutzim, for example, erected heroic memorial sculptures, such as the sculptures erected on Kibbutz Yad Mordechai (1951) or Kibbutz Negba (1953), which were expressionist attempts to emphasize the ideological and social connections between art and the presence of public expression. Within the framework of HaKibbutz Ha’Artzi intimate memorial sculptures were erected, such as the memorial sculpture “Mother and Child”, which Chana Orloff erected at Kibbutz Ein Gev (1954) or Yechiel Shemi's sculpture on Kibbutz Hasolelim (1954). These sculptures emphasized the private world of the individual and tended toward the abstract.
One of the most famous memorial sculptors during the first decades after the founding of the State of Israel was Nathan Rapoport, who immigrated to Israel in 1950, after he had already erected a memorial sculpture in the Warsaw Ghetto to the fighters of the Ghetto (1946-1948). Rapoport’s many memorial sculptures, erected as memorials on government sites and on sites connected to the War of Independence, were representatives of sculptural expressionism, which took its inspiration from Neoclassicism as well. At Warsaw Ghetto Square at Yad Vashem (1971), Rapoport created a relief entitled “The Last March”, which depicts a group of Jews holding a Torah scroll. To the left of this, Rapoport erected a copy of the sculpture he created for the Warsaw Ghetto. In this way, a “Zionist narrative” of the Holocaust was created, emphasizing the heroism of the victims alongside the mourning.
In contrast to the figurative art which had characterized it earlier, from the 1950s on a growing tendency towards abstraction began to appear in memorial sculpture. At the center of the “Pilots’ Memorial” (1950s), erected by Benjamin Tammuz and Aba Elhanani in the Independence Park in Tel Aviv-Yaffo, stands an image of a bird flying above a Tel Aviv seaside cliff. The tendency toward the abstract can also be seen the work by David Palombo, who created reliefs and memorial sculptures for government institutions like the Knesset and Yad Vashem, and in many other works, such as the memorial to Shlomo Ben-Yosef that Itzhak Danziger erected in Rosh Pina. However, the epitome of this trend toward avoidance of figurative images stands our starkly in the “Monument to the Negev Brigade” (1963-1968) which Dani Karavan created on the outskirts of the city of Beersheva. The monument was planned as a structure made of exposed concrete occasionally adorned with elements of metaphorical significance. The structure was an attempt to create a physical connection between itself and the desert landscape in which it stands, a connection conceptualized in the way the visitor wanders and views the landscape from within the structure. A mixture of symbolism and abstraction can be found in the “Monument to the Holocaust and National Revival”, erected in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square (then “Kings of Israel Square”). Igael Tumarkin, creator of the sculpture, used elements that created the symbolic form of an inverted pyramid made of metal, concrete, and glass. In spite of the fact that the glass is supposed to reflect what is happening in this urban space, the monument didn’t express the desire for the creation of a new space which would carry on a dialogue with the landscape of the “Land of Israel”. The pyramid sits on a triangular base, painted yellow, reminiscent of the “Mark of Cain”. The two structures together form a Magen David. Tumarkin saw in this form “a prison cell that has been opened and breached. An overturned pyramid, which contains within itself, imprisoned in its base, the confined and the burdensome.” The form of the pyramid shows up in another work of the artists as well. In a late interview with him Tumarkin confided that the pyramid can be perceived also as the gap between ideology and its enslaved results: “What have we learned since the great pyramids were built 4200 years ago?[...] Do works of forced labor and death liberate?”
In the 1990s memorial sculptures began to be built in a theatrical style, abandoning the abstract. In the “Children’s Memorial” (1987), or the “Yad Vashem Train Car” (1990) by Moshe Safdie, or in the Memorial to the victims of “The Israeli Helicopter Disaster” (2008), alongside the use of symbolic forms, we see the trend towards the use of various techniques to intensify the emotional experience of the viewer.
Characteristics of Israeli Sculpture.
With regard to an obvious trend in Israeli sculpture, the relationship to the realistic depiction of the human body is complex. The birth of Israeli sculpture took place concurrently with the flowering of avantgarde and modernist European art, whose influence on sculpture from the 1930s to the present day is significant. In the 1940s the trend toward primitivism among local artists was dominant. With the appearance of “Canaanite” art we see an expression of the opposite concept of the human body, as part of the image of the landscape of “The Land of Israel.” That same desolate desert landscape became a central motif in many works of art until the 1980s. With regard to materials, we see a small amount of use of stone and marble in traditional techniques of excavation and carving, and a preference for casting and welding. This phenomenon was dominant primarily in the 1950s, as a result of the popularity of the abstract sculpture of the “New Horizons” group. In addition this sculpture enabled artists to create art on a monumental scale, which was not common in Israeli art until then.

German language in Namibia

Namibia is a multilingual country whereby German is recognized national language (a form of minority language) and serves as a lingua franca along with Afrikaans, English, Ovambo and Herero. While English is the sole official language of the country, in many areas of the country German enjoys some official status at a community level.
German is especially widely used in central and southern Namibia and was until 1990 one of three official languages in what was then South-West Africa, alongside Afrikaans and English. German is the main or mother tongue of about 30,000 Namibians, a number composed roughly equally of German Namibians as well as older black speakers of Namibian Black German and Namibians who as children grew up in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The German Namibian newspaper "Allgemeine Zeitung" on its website refers to 22,000 native speakers and of several hundred thousand who know German as a second (third etc.) language. German benefits from its similarity to Afrikaans and has a prominent position in the tourism and business sectors. Many Namibian natural features, place and street names have German names. Some experts see the future of German in Namibia as threatened.
History.
During the period as a German colony from 1884 to 1915 German was the only official language in German Southwest Africa, as Namibia was then known. Boers, i.e. South African whites who spoke Dutch (South African Dutch would later develop into Afrikaans) already lived in the country alongside Orlam tribes and mixed-race Reheboth Basters.
South Africa took over administration of the country in 1915. However, German language privileges and education remained in place. In 1916 the "Allgemeine Zeitung" newspaper was founded under its original name of "Der Kriegsbote". After the end of the First World War the South African attitude to the German Namibians changes, and between 1919 and 1920 about half of the Germans were transferred out of the country. In 1920 Dutch (later to be superseded by Afrikaans) and English replaced German as the official languages of the country.
The German-speaking population wished German to be reinstated as an official language and in 1932 the Treaty of Cape Town encouraged South Africa to do so. It was hoped that this would throw a spanner in the works against South African annexing South-West Africa into the Union of South Africa. South Africa did not officially recognize German, however, de facto German was added to Afrikaans and English as a working language of the government. Only in 1984 would German officially be added as an official language.
After independence in 1990, English became the sole official language of Namibia, and German thus lost its official status, but German today continues to be used in a wide range of spheres of Namibian life.
Situation today.
Degree of use.
German is more widely used than may be assumed by its lack of official status. About 30,000 Namibians speak German as a mother tongue, and several tens of thousands of Namibians, either white native English or Afrikaans speakers or better-off black Namibians, speak German as a second (third, etc.) language. German is taught in many schools, is the medium for a daily newspaper, the Allgemeine Zeitung as well as daily programming on the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation. Although German (and for that matter English) is not common as a mother tongue among the black population, a number of public servants especially in the tourism sector possess German proficiency to various degrees.
However there are many spheres in which the German language is not or barely present at all — sphere with a small number of white people, especially in the north part of the country, but also in many neighborhoods of Windhoek.
Culture.
German is used as a medium of communication in a wide range of cultural spheres:
Education.
In addition to 32 schools in which about 14,000 pupils learn German as a foreign language, there are about a dozen German-medium schools, including the Deutsche Höhere Privatschule Windhoek (DHPS), German schools in Omaruru and Otjiwarongo as well as five government schools. There are several additional elementary schools, German-medium high schools and a German-medium "Gymnasium" in Windhoek.
The University of Namibia offers German-medium programs in German studies and business administration.
Signs.
Signs for shops, restaurants and services are often in English and German, reflecting not only a high proportion of German-Namibian ownership but also the high number of German-speaking tourists that visit the country. However, a customer entering such as shop may well be greeted in Afrikaans; relatively fewer signs are in Afrikaans but the language retains a leading position as a spoken lingua franca in Windhoek and throughout the central and southern parts of the country.
German is also found on signs for tourists, especially those to monuments and historic buildings from the German colonial period. Other signs that include German date back before 1990, when English, Afrikaans and German shared status as official languages of the country.
Street names.
In Windhoek, Swakopmund, Keetmanshoop, Grootfontein and Lüderitz many or most street names are German in origin, even though after 1990 many streets were renamed to honor black Namibian people. (See for example List of former Swakopmund street names). Streets named before 1990 often end in "Str.", the standard abbreviation in German for "Straße", and in Afrikaans for "straat"; streets renamed since 1990 often end in "St.", implying the English abbreviation for "Street".
Place names.
Unlike other parts of the world with large German immigration and large numbers of German place names, Namibia never experienced a wave of place-name changes. Especially in the south, in the regions of Hardap and Karas, about 80% of all place names are either German, Afrikaans, or a mix of German or Afrikaans with English. Examples include "Keetmanshoop" (after German industrialist "Johann Keetman" and the Afrikaans word for "hope", "hoop".
Namibian German as a dialect.
The German language as spoken in Namibia is characterized by simplification and the adoption of many words from Afrikaans, English, and Ovambo and other Bantu languages. This variant of German is called variously "Südwesterdeutsch" (German "südwest", southwest, referring to the country's former name, South-West Africa); while younger people also call it "Namsläng" (i.e. Namibian slang) or "Namlish".

USCGC Point Baker (WPB-82342)

USCGC "Point Baker" (WPB-82342) was an Point class cutter constructed at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1963 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1963 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as "WPB-82342" when commissioned and acquired the name "Point Baker" in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .
Construction and design details.
"Point Baker" was built to accommodate an 8 man crew. She was powered by two VT800 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.
The design specifications for "Point Baker" included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.
History.
After commissioning, "Point Baker" was initially stationed at Port Isabel, Texas where she was used for law enforcement and search and rescue operations. In late 1966 her homeport was shifted to Port Aransas, Texas.
On 27 December 1966 she towed the disabled FV "Sherry Ann" to Port Aransas. On 15 June 1967 she towed the FV " Old Man" from 50 miles east southeast of Freeport, Texas to Aransas Pass, Texas following the medivac of the vessel's master by a Coast Guard helicopter. On 10 December she towed the disabled FV "Baroness" from 90 miles east northeast of Port Aransas to that port. On 8 September 1968 she towed the disabled FV "Gulf Star" to Port Aransas. While patrolling within the twelve mile limit in August 1975, "Point Baker" boarded and seized the Cuban fishing vessel "E-82" for illegal fishing. The seized vessel was towed to Corpus Christi, Texas where it was impounded and the Cuban crew was turned over to Department of Justice representatives. in January 1981 she made the largest seizure of illegal drugs up to that time off the coast of Texas when she seized over 15 tons of marijuana from the hold of a fishing vessel.
In 1991 she again changed homeports; this time to Sabine Pass, Texas where she remained until decommissioning. During the mass exodus of Cuban and Haitian migrants in 1994 "Point Baker" rescued many persons from sub-standard vessels. In August, she along with another cutter rescued 200 Cubans from a sinking vessel.
During her Coast Guard career "Point Baker" and her crews earned three Coast Guard Unit Commendations and two Meritorious Unit Commendations.
"Point Baker" was decommissioned 6 February 2002 and was transferred to the Coast Guard of Georgia where she was commissioned as "General Mazniashvili" (P211), homeported in Batumi, Georgia.

St John the Divine, Richmond

St John the Divine, Richmond, in the Anglican Diocese of Southwark, is a Grade II listed church on Kew Road, in Richmond, London, in the Early Gothic Revival architectural style. It was built from 1831 to 1836 on a site provided by local resident and landowner, William Selwyn QC (1775–1855); the architect was Lewis Vulliamy. 
Richmond grew rapidly during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. By the 1820s, Richmond's original parish church, St Mary Magdalene, was hard-pressed to accommodate an ever-growing congregation. The vestry eventually recognised the need for a new chapel. The design was formally underway by 1831, and the new chapel, St John the Divine, was completed in 1836. In 1838 it became a parish church in its own right.
The organ, built by Beale and Thynne, was dedicated in December 1896. Described as "a virtually unaltered work of Victorian artistry", it has been fully restored.
20th century additions.
A chancel, south chapel and vestries were added in 1904–05; they were designed by Arthur Grove.The large painted triptych behind the altar was completed in 1908 by N H J Westlake who also painted the sanctuary ceiling, which illustrates passages from the Book of Revelation, chapter 14. In the 1960s, the Stations of the Cross were carved between 1955 and 1970 by Freda Skinner, a pupil of Henry Moore, based on the Stations by Eric Gill in Westminster Cathedral. Gill’s own work in the church can be seen in the stone carving over the sacristy door and on the triptych. 
The church hall (1911), in brick, is by Arthur Grove with an Art Nouveau carved stone doorway reminiscent of the style of Charles Harrison Townsend.
In 1980–81 adaptations were made to the church to enable it be used occasionally for concerts and to provide a meeting room, toilet facilities and residential accommodation; the architects were Dry Hastwell Butlin Bicknell (a partnership of David Dry (1934–2011), Vince Hastwell, George Butlin and Roger Bicknell).
Architectural criticism.
Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner criticise Vulliamy's "craziest W spire and senseless flying buttresses from the W porches up to the nave" but describe Grove's east end as "a fine composition".
Lady chapel.
The Lady chapel is used for quiet reflection and prayer.

St. John the Divine is closely identified with the Catholic tradition of the Church of England and describes its ethos as "Modern/Liberal Catholic", with a fairly formal liturgical style.
The Eucharist is the principal act of worship on Sundays and in the week and is accompanied by vestments, candles and incense, together with a strong musical tradition.
People.
Vigo Auguste Demant, vicar at St John the Divine from 1933 to 1942, became a Canon of St Paul’s Cathedral, an Oxford professor and was a regular broadcaster on the BBC's Third Programme in the 1950s.He served on the committee that produced the 1957 Wolfenden report that recommended that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence".

David Schley Schaff

David Schley Schaff (17 October 1852, Mercersburg, Pennsylvania – 2 March 1941, Winter Park, Florida) was a United States Presbyterian clergyman and educator.
Biography.
He was the son of theologian and historian Philip Schaff. He graduated from Yale in 1873 (A.B.) and in 1877 was ordained in the Presbyterian ministry. He served as pastor 1877–1907. He was professor of church history at Lane Theological Seminary 1897–1903; beginning in 1903, he was professor of ecclesiastical and doctrinal history at Lane. He was a delegate to the Pan-Presbyterian Council at Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1913.
David Schley Schaff played an early role in the introduction of and development of football in the United States. A graduate of the Rugby School in England, he was familiar with the game of football. In 1872, while a student at Yale, he helped organize and served as the President of the Yale Football Association and was the Captain of Yale's first intercollegiate football team. Sadly he did not play in their first game because of injury.

Partial differential algebraic equation

In mathematics a partial differential algebraic equation (PDAE) set is an incomplete system of partial differential equations that is closed with a set of algebraic equations.
Definition.
A general PDAE is defined as:
where:
The relationship between a PDAE and a partial differential equation (PDE) is analogous to the relationship between an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and a differential algebraic equation (DAE).
PDAEs of this general form are challenging to solve. Simplified forms are studied in more detail in the literature. Even as recently as 2000, the term "PDAE" has been handled as unfamiliar by those in related fields.
Solution methods.
Semi-discretization is a common method for solving PDAEs whose independent variables are those of time and space, and has been used for decades. This method involves removing the spatial variables using a discretization method, such as the finite volume method, and incorporating the resulting linear equations as part of the algebraic relations. This reduces the system to a DAE, for which conventional solution methods can be employed.

2012 College Station, Texas shooting

On August 13, 2012, a shooting occurred in College Station, Texas near Texas A&M University around 12:30 p.m. central time, in which multiple people, mostly police officers, were shot in a shootout. The suspect, who was shot and fatally wounded in the gunfight, was later identified as 35-year-old Thomas Alton Caffall III. Police found a Vz 58 Tactical Sporter rifle, a Mosin-Nagant M91/30 rifle with a bayonet, a .40-caliber Sig Sauer pistol stolen from a police officer, and a PSL Dragunov rifle with a scope in his house after the shooting.
The shootout.
The shooting began when 41-year-old Brazos County Constable Brian Bachmann arrived at the house of Thomas Caffall with the intention to serve a notice for him to appear in court on August 23 due to a failure to pay his rent, in which he owed $1,250. Caffall apparently became outraged by this and opened fire as the officer approached his home, fatally wounding Bachmann. He then stole Bachmann's .40-caliber Sig Sauer pistol and also shot 51-year-old Barbara Holdsworth as she parked her vehicle in a driveway half a block from Caffall's home. Holdsworth's boyfriend witnessed her shooting and made the first call to 9-1-1.
Numerous officers arrived at the scene at 12:14 p.m. and engaged in a shootout with Caffall that lasted for approximately thirty minutes. In this exchange of gunfire, three officers and a bystander were hit; the wounds of the bystander, 43-year-old Chris Northcliff, who was Caffall's landowner, were fatal. The shootout ended with Caffall's death from gunshots fired by police at 12:35 p.m. During the shooting, a "code maroon" was issued at the university after multiple people were shot according to police spokesperson Rhonda Seaton. A total of 65 rounds were fired by Caffall during the shootout.
Early reports of the incident indicated six people were wounded and that the shooter was taken into custody. Later reports indicated that a law enforcement officer and a civilian were both killed by gunfire, and at least three others, including some who may not have been injured by gunfire, were wounded. At least two fatalities, one law enforcement officer and one civilian, were reported, and another civilian and a College Station police officer were also reported injured in the shooting.
Brian Bachmann was identified as the slain police officer by College Station Police Department Assistant Police Chief Scott McCollum. Bachmann was the elected Constable for Precinct 1 in Brazos County, Texas, and he had been a Brazos County Sheriff's Deputy since 1993, according to the Facebook page for his 2010 Constable's Campaign. Chris Northcliff was then identified as the deceased civilian.
Victims.
Three people, including the shooter, were killed in the incident:
Four others were injured in the incident:
Perpetrator.
The shooter was identified as 35-year-old gun collector Thomas Alton Caffall III. He was confirmed to not be a student of Texas A&M nor a school employee. Caffall's stepfather, Richard Weaver, revealed in an interview that his son was recently refusing to work and had quit from his job nine months prior to the shooting. He also described Caffall as regularly playing video games, which seemed to distort his sense of reality. Caffall's other family also specified that he was suffering from some sort of mental illness. Prior to the shooting, Caffall posted photos of his gun collection on his Facebook profile.
Reaction.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Texas A&M alumni, gave a statement during an event in Florida, saying that his "prayers are with any of those that have been injured." A&M President R. Bowen Loftin also described the day as a "sad day in the Bryan-College Station community." Caffall's family also issued statements of apology, with his sister Courtney Clark saying, "Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and this is just a senseless tragedy...We are just distraught by the havoc that he has caused."

Physical cultural studies

Physical Cultural Studies (PCS) encompasses the diversely focused field of scholarly work which is united by a commitment toward engaging varied dimensions or expressions of (in)active bodies or physical culture (Andrews & Silk, 2011). In this physical culture is understood as “cultural practices in which the physical body – the way it moves, is represented, has meanings assigned to it, and is imbued with power – is central” (Vertinsky, quoted in Silk & Andrews, 2011)
Physical Cultural Studies is closely related to the fields of sport sociology, cultural studies, sociology of the body, body culture studies, queer studies and disability studies. 
Description.
Empirical focus.
PCS is predominantly concerned with studying the active body. The aim of such a focus is to problematise the taken-for-granted aspects of human movement and embodiment in such a way that makes social divisions (class, gender, ethnicity, ability, generation, sex, nation, race), and the processes that produce, reproduce and contest these divisions become visible and changeable. In this respect, we can see that the 'physical' is of central importance to PCS. Indeed, it is this empirical focus ( and subsequent breadth) that separates PCS from fields such as the sociology of sport. This is because PCS scholars take as their subjects of study - all the many and varied, more or less 'legitimate', popular and emerging, work or leisure related - forms of physical culture. areas of study include: exercise, health, dance, recreation, leisure, fitness, daily living, and work related activities.
Concern with Context.
In the analysis of these activities PCS considers context and contextualisation to be vital. Indeed, how can one understand a cultural practice without reference to all the surrounding factors, flows, processes, actors and institutions with which it is articulated? specifically, for example, PCS researchers identify and seek to understand the complex political, economic, social and technological relationships in which the event occurs in order to understand physical culture as relational
Social Change.
Those in the field of physical cultural studies believe that research into, or understanding of, physical culture is of little importance if it does not make a difference in the world. Therefore, the idea of 'value free' research is not accepted in PCS. Instead, Partisanship is the dominant ideal. Such a perspective is related to many aspects of PCS study that vary from 'mainstream' academia. For example, PCS is concerned with care and community in which public education is of central importance. In addition, PCS aims to be political, empowering and reflexive. Finally PCS researchers attempt to question their presupposed hierarchy over the researched.
See also praxis
Methodology.
PCS incorporates many methods of gathering data, oftentimes implementing a variety of methods together to create rich, contextual and multi-perspective analyses of physical culture. such methods include: ethnography, auto ethnography, contextual analysis, media analysis, discourse analysis and participant observation.

Salsabil (horse)

Salsabil (18 January 1987 – October 1996) was an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. In a racing career which lasted from September 1989 to October 1990 she ran nine times times and won seven races. Salsabil was one of the leading two-year-old fillies in Europe in 1989, winning two races including the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac at the Longchamp. After winning the Fred Darling Stakes on her three-year-old debut, Salsabil won both of Britain's Classic races for fillies: the 1000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket and the Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom. She was then raced against colts and became the first filly for ninety years to win the Irish Derby at the Curragh. In autumn, Salsabil added a victory in the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp but finished unplaced when favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in October. Salsabil was then retired to stud where she had success as a broodmare before dying of cancer in 1996.
Background.
Salsabil was a bay filly with a white blaze bred in County Meath, Ireland by the Kilcarn Stud. Salsabil was one of the first champions sired by Sadler's Wells and her earnings in 1990 enabled the stallion to win the first of his thirteen sires' championships. Salsabil's dam, Flame of Tara, won the Coronation Stakes in 1983, and went on to be an extremely successful broodmare. Apart from Salsabil, she produced eleven winners including Marju, a colt who won the St. James's Palace Stakes and finished second in the Epsom Derby. As a descendant of the broodmare Aloe, Flame of Tara was related to Pebbles, Round Table, Nashwan, Go For Wand and many other successful racehorses.
As a yearling, Salsabil was bought for the equivalent of $800,000 by Hamdan Al Maktoum. She was named "Salsabil" (Arabic سلسبيل) after a spring in the Islamic paradise. The filly was trained throughout her career by John Dunlop at Arundel, West Sussex. She was ridden in all of her races by Willie Carson.
Racing career.
1989: two-year-old season.
Salsabil began her racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Nottingham Racecourse in September. She started 4/5 favourite and won easily by three lengths. Later that month Salsabil started at odds of 4/9 for the Jack Collier Memorial Stakes at Newbury, but after leading a furlong from the finish she was caught in the closing stages and beaten a short head by Free At Last. Eighteen days after her Newbury defeat, Salsabil was stepped up in class for the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp. Salsabil turned into the straight in sixth place before taking the lead and being driven out by Carson to win by two lengths from Houseproud, a filly who went on to win the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches.
1990: three-year-old season.
On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Salsabil was sent to Newbury for the Fred Darling Stakes, a trial race for the 1000 Guineas. The race attracted a strong field for a Group Three race, and Salsabil started third favourite behind Dead Certain, the Cheveley Park Stakes winner and Chimes of Freedom, the winner of the Moyglare Stud Stakes. Carson positioned the filly in fifth place before moving into the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish. Salsabil drew away from her opponents to win by six lengths. Thirteen days later, Salsabil started 6/4 favourite for the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. Her opponents included Free at Last, the filly who had inflicted her only defeat, and Heart of Joy, the unbeaten winner of the Nell Gwyn Stakes. Salsabil challenged Heart of Joy for the lead inside the final furlong and was hard ridden by Carson to win by three-quarters of a lengths. Negligent was five lengths further back in third.
A month later Salsabil was moved up in distance for the one and a half mile Epsom Oaks and started 2/1 favourite, just ahead of the Irish 1000 Guineas winner In the Groove. Racing on softer ground than at Newmarket, Salsabil was restrained by Carson in the early stages before moving up to take the lead in the straight. She pulled clear of the field to win by five lengths from Game Plan, with In the Groove finishing fourth. After the Oaks, Salsabil's connections took the unusual step of sending her to contest the Irish Derby against colts. Few fillies had contested the race, and none had been successful since Gallinaria in 1900. The field included Quest for Fame and Blue Stag, first and second in the Epsom Derby and Sheikh Mohammed's highly-rated Belmez. Salsabil took the lead in the straight and won by three quarters of a length from the outsider Deploy, with a gap of four lengths back to Belmez, who narrowly beat Blue Stag and Quest for Fame for third.
Salsabil was rested until autumn, when she returned with the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at her target. In September, she started 2/5 favourite for the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp over the Arc course and distance. Salsabil took the lead in the straight, but had to be driven out by Carson to prevail by a neck and half a length from Miss Alleged and In the Groove. On 7 October, Salsabil started favourite against twenty opponents in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, despite being given an unfavourable draw. She failed to reproduce her best form and was never in contention, finishing tenth behind Saumarez.
Assessment and honours.
The independent Timeform organisation gave Salsabil a rating of 130.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Salsabil a "superior" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks and the thirtieth best filly or mare trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century.
Shadwell's Salsabil Stud, near Bury St Edmunds, was named in honour of the mare.
The Salsabil Stakes a Listed race for three-year-old fillies, is run at Navan Racecourse in April.
Stud record.
Salsabil retired to become a broodmare for Shadwell Stud. In five years, she produced five foals, four of whom won races, three at Group level. Sahm, her only colt, won the Knickerbocker Handicap, Bint Salsabil won the Rockfel Stakes and Alabaq won the Premio Bagutta Memorial Sergio Cumani. In October 1996, Salsabil was euthanized after being diagnosed with cancer of the colon, and was buried at Shadwell Stud.
