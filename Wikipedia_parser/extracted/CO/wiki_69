21 Aquilae is the Flamsteed designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Aquila. Its apparent magnitude is 5.14 and it is located at a distance of around from Earth, give or take a 40 light-year margin of error. The stellar classification of this star is B8 II-III, with the luminosity class of II-III suggesting that the spectrum displays elements of both a giant star and a bright giant. The outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 13,175 K; this searing heat gives it the blue-white glow of a B-type star.

31 Aquilae

31 Aquilae is the Flamsteed designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Aquila. It has the Bayer designation b Aquilae. This star has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.16 and is 49.5 light years from Earth. It has no known companions.
Properties.
31 Aquilae has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.16, making it bright enough to be seen with the naked eye in dark skies. The annual parallax shift of 65.89 mas yields a distance estimate of from Earth. It is a variable star with a magnitude change of less than 0.02.
With a stellar classification of G8 IV, the luminosity class of IV indicates this is a subgiant star. Compared to the Sun, it has 116% of the mass and 138% of the radius. It is radiating nearly double the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5,510 K, giving it the yellow hue of an G-type star. Its age is probably similar to NGC 188, the oldest open cluster known, which was calculated to be over 5 billion years. For its age, it is surprisingly rich in elements other than hydrogen or helium, contrary to common assumptions that the oldest stars should be metal-poor.
No certain substellar companion has been detected so far around 31 Aquilae. McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the presence of one or more planets around 31 Aquilae with masses between 0.22 and 1.9 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 Astronomical Units.
Optical companions.
The following stars are optical companions that are coincidentally aligned near the line of sight to 31 Aquilae.

11 Aquilae

11 Aquilae is the Flamsteed designation for a single star in the equatorial constellation Aquila. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.2, which means it is faintly visible to the naked eye. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 20.65 mas, the distance to this star is approximately . The brightness of this star is diminished by 0.33 in magnitude because of extinction from interstellar gas and dust.
This is an F-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of F8 V. It is radiating about 19 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 6,074 K, giving it the yellow-white glow of an F-type star. 11 Aquilae has been listed as a candidate for membership in the Ursa Major Moving Group, but most likely does not belong to that association.

Flash (Queen song)

"Flash" is a song by British rock band Queen. Written by guitarist Brian May, "Flash" is the theme song of the 1980 film "Flash Gordon". The soundtrack released to coincide with the film contained only the music composed and performed by Queen.
There are two versions of the song. The album version ("Flash's Theme") is in fact the start to the movie, with all the dialogue from the first scene. The single version features dialogue cut from various parts of the movie, most memorably, Brian Blessed's character exclaiming "Gordon's alive?!" This version was also included on the "Greatest Hits" compilation from 1981.
Flash is sung as a duet between Freddie Mercury and Brian May, with Roger Taylor adding the high harmonies. May plays all of the instruments except for the rhythm section. He used an Imperial Bösendorfer Grand Piano (with 97 keys instead of 88, having an extra octave on the low range), Oberheim OBX synth (which he plays in the video) and his homemade Red Special guitar.
Contrary to connections made in popular culture, and despite the song's title, it bears no relation to the DC Comics character of the same name.
Music Video.
The video for the song was filmed at Anvil Studios, London in November 1980 and directed by Don Norman and features the band performing the song to a screen showing clips from the film. An alternate version which was broadcast during the Concert For Kampuchea during 1981 featuring alternate film clips was included on the Flash Gordon 2011 iTunes edition.

Olowe of Ise

Olowe of Ise (born circa 1875, died circa 1938) is considered by Western art historians and collectors to be the most or one of the most important 20th century artist of the Yoruba people of what is today Nigeria, Africa. He was a wood sculptor and master innovator in the African style of design known as oju-ona.
Olowe was born in Efon-Alaiye, a town known as a major cultural centre in Yorubaland, but he lived most of his life in the city of Ise. He was initially employed as a messenger at the court of King Arinjale of Ise. It is a matter of dispute whether his artistic career began as an apprenticeship or arose purely from his own natural talent. His fame as a sculptor appears to have begun at Ise under the patronage of Arinjale before spreading throughout eastern Yorubaland. Olowe was summoned to Ilesa, Ikere, Akure, Idanre, Ogbagi and other towns located within a 60-mile radius (96.75 kilometers) to create elaborate household (such as doors and veranda posts), personal and ritual objects for wealthy families. 
Olowe's celebrated status as an artist was recorded by his contemporaries in Yoruba oral praise poetry known as "oriki". For instance, this example sung by one of his wives and recorded in 1988.
International Fame.
In 1924, Olowe's art was exhibited overseas for the first time when a door and lintel ensemble from the royal palace at Ikere was selected for the Nigerian Pavilion at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, London. This work of art was subsequently acquired by the British Museum.
External links and references.
Note that Olowe's sculptures were originally painted, but the paint has typically since worn down.

Wichita East High School

Wichita High School East, known locally as East, is a public, co-educational secondary school located near the center of Wichita, Kansas. With a student population of 2,300, it is the largest high school in the state. Originally known as Wichita High School, East was the first of seven traditional public high schools to be built in USD 259, Wichita's Unified School District. In 1929, when Wichita North High School was completed, the school's name was changed to Wichita High School East. The school's campus and the building's Collegiate Gothic styling make it an urban landmark.
History.
Wichita East traces its roots back to 1878, although the current building wasn't completed until 1923. Originally built on a campus shared with Roosevelt Junior High School, the high school's growing enrollment forced the conversion of the junior high school into a second wing of the high school. The junior high school and high school were joined by a third structure in 1976-1977, a library and cafeteria that connects the second floor of the two buildings. In 2004, a construction project added a new gymnasium, additional science classrooms, and air conditioning to the building. In 2012, the school celebrated the opening of the new drama theater and fine arts wing. The campus is also home to the Wichita Area Technical College.
Academics.
Wichita High School East is regionally recognized for both academic and athletic success. The school offers both the Wichita Public Schools diploma and the International Baccalaureate Diploma, a magnet diploma that attracts students from all around the Wichita metro area. East consistently leads Wichita-area schools in academic awards. The high school newspaper is "The Messenger", a member of the High School National Ad Network.
East is known for its choral, band, orchestra, and drama programs. All of the music programs have won several awards for outstanding performance throughout the years. East has a large and successful debate and forensics squad and consistently qualifies students for the national tournament. In June 2007, East hosted the debate portion of NFL Nationals.
Extracurricular activities.
Athletics.
Athletically, East is home to a consistently competitive basketball program that has 8 state championships and the 1925 national championship to its credit. In addition, the Blue Aces football team has been increasingly successful in recent years due to leadership changes as well as two highly acclaimed and heavily recruited brothers, Arthur (Class of 2008) and Bryce Brown (Class of 2009), both now in the NFL. East athletics compete in the Greater Wichita Athletic League against the city's seven largest public high schools and two Catholic high schools. East is a 6A school, the largest size recognized by the Kansas High School Athletics Association. Since 1928, East High teams have been known as the Blue Aces, and the school is represented by its mascot, Max, a World War I flying ace with an oversized head and a pronounced cleft chin. The schools colors are Navy Blue and White with Columbia Blue as a third color.
National Championship.
The 1925 boys basketball team won the National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament in Chicago. The tournament was an attempt by Amos Alonzo Stagg to create a national high school champion which lasted from 1917 to 1930 before school administrators intervened to oppose the concept of a national tournament. Wichita defeated El Reno High School 27-6 in the final. Two members of the team Barry Dunham and Ross McBurney would be the core of the Wichita-based Henry Clothiers team that won consecutive national Amateur Athletic Union titles in 1930, 1931 and 1932 at a time when corporate-sponsored teams and colleges competed in the same tournament.

Griff's Hamburgers

Griff’s Hamburgers, or Griff's Burger Bar, is a regional fast food chain founded in 1960 by Griff's of America, Inc. of Kansas City, Missouri, United States. At one time they had locations nationwide with the majority in the South near highway exits.
Griff's was named for the founder, Harold Griffin.
The restaurant buildings were of a patented A-frame design, produced by Valentine Diners of Wichita, Kansas. Later restaurants sported more conventional architecture. A bright yellow sign read HAMBURGERS in big block capitals. The restaurants offered both drive-thrus and patio dining.
Most of the stores were located in high traffic locations, such as near a highway off-ramp, or along Route 66. There was one on the corner of Caruthers and Independence in Cape Girardeau, Missouri in the 1960s, catty corner from old Central High School.
Corporate headquarters for Griff's of America is now in Dallas, Texas. The first store opened in Texas was in Fort Worth, TX on East Lancaster Avenue and stores remain open in Arvada and Denver, Colorado; Bossier City, Ruston and Shreveport, Louisiana; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Dallas, Fort Worth, Haltom City, Garland, Irving, Mesquite, and San Antonio, Texas. A location in Sedalia, Missouri closed in late 2011.
The restaurant chain was featured in multiple installments of the Zippy the Pinhead comic strip; on November 15, 2004, February 10, 2005 December 19, 2006, and September 2, 2007.

Severin Roesen

Severin Roesen (05.02.1816 in Boppard – after 1872) is a painter known for his abundant fruit and flower still lifes and is today recognized as one of the major American still-life painters of the mid-nineteenth century.
Life.
Little is known about Roesen. He was baptized on 05.02.1816 in Boppard. His parents were Stephanus and Margaretha (nee Krebs.) On the 10th March 1847 at Sankt Kastor Katholisch, Koblenz Stadt, Rheinland, Prussia he married Sophia Jacobina Lambricht b 22 January 1824. He was a porcelain painter in Cologne and exhibited a floral painting at the Cologne local art club in 1847. On the way to New York he arrived at Dover England on the 27th December 1847. He immigrated to New York and arrived on February 4, 1848, and exhibited eleven paintings there at the American Art-Union between 1848 and 1852. Sophia died soon after their marriage and on the 30th October 1849 he re married. The marriage took place at the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saint Matthew in York York City.His new wife was Wilhelmine Ludwig born 1831 in Alzey Germany. They had 2 children. Minnie b 1854 and Oscar b 1857. Roesen moved to Pennsylvania in 1857, leaving New York and his family. He lived briefly in Philadelphia, and then moved to rural, German-American communities in Harrisburg, Huntingdon, and finally Williamsport, where he settled around 1863. During this period, he also exhibited works at the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore in 1858, at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1863, and at the Brooklyn Art Association in 1873.
The "Williamsport Sun and Banner" reported in 1895:
His studio was much frequented by his friends, who would sit all day with this genial, well read and generous companion, smoking his pipes and drinking his beer, and he was seldom without this beverage. . . . In one corner of the finished painting would always appear the faint outline of a beer glass, and when a customer objected to its presence, he would say, 'Why, do you not like beer?' and then take it out.
A large number of Roesen's paintings were discovered in Williamsport. His pictures of nature's abundance found a ready market in the town's growing population (many of German descent) of prosperous merchants and lumbermen, who purchased them to adorn their newly built homes as well as taverns, restaurants, and hotels. One hotelier and brewer, Jacob Flock, owned more than fifty paintings by Roesen, which were presumably traded for lodging and for beer, the artist's favorite beverage.
Roesen's last dated painting is from 1872, and his life after, as well as his date and place of death, remains unknown.
Work.
Over three hundred still life paintings by Roesen have been recorded, of which only about two dozen are dated.
While Roesen's paintings reveal a meticulous attention to detail in their precise arrangements and close brushwork, his subject matter, even down to specific motifs, did not change throughout his career. Sometimes he made near copies of paintings, but usually he merely rearranged and reassembled stock elements.
Numerous items in "Fruit and Wine Glass", for example, also appear in other paintings. The footed dessert plate full of strawberries is a common motif. The pilsner glass, sometimes accompanied by an open bottle of champagne, is interchangeable with a wine goblet filled with lemonade used elsewhere. The glass is nearly always placed at the lower left edge of the painting; a halved lemon often appears nearby. Branches full of grapes arranged from lower left to upper right provide the composition with a graceful S-curve and subtly lead the viewer's eye over the entire display. Here the composition is balanced by light and dark grapes at either side and filled in by scattered raspberries, cherries, peaches, apples, pears, and apricots. Many of these compositional elements, if not the items depicted, were derived from seventeenth-century Dutch still life paintings by such artists as Jan van Huysem.

<doc id="2902981" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2902981" title="Windows Aero">
Windows Aero

Windows Aero (a backronym for "Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open") is a set of interface and design guidelines that were introduced by the Windows Vista operating system. The changes made in the Aero interface affected many elements of the Windows interface and how it functions, including the incorporation of a new look, along with changes in interface guidelines reflecting appearance, layout, and the phrasing and tone of instructions and other text in applications.
History.
Windows Vista.
The Aero interface was unveiled for Windows Vista as a complete redesign of the Windows interface, replacing Windows XP's "Luna" theme. Until the release of Windows Vista Beta 1 in July 2005, little had been shown of Aero in public or leaked builds. Previous user interfaces were "Plex", which was featured in Longhorn builds 3683–4039; "Slate", which was featured in build 4042 and was available until build 4093; and "Jade" (builds 4074, 4083 and 4093). Microsoft started using the "Aero" theme in public builds in build 5048. The first build with full-featured Aero was build 5219. Build 5270 (released in December 2005) contained an implementation of the Aero theme which was virtually complete, according to sources at Microsoft, though a number of stylistic changes were introduced between then and the operating system's release.
Windows Aero incorporated the following features in Windows Vista.
Windows 7.
Windows Aero is revised in Windows 7, with several UI changes, a more touch-friendly UI and many new visual effects and features, including mouse gestures:
Windows 8.
While retaining interface elements introduced by Vista and 7, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 make changes to the visual appearance of the operating system to incorporate the Metro design language. As a result of these changes, the Aero Glass theme was replaced by a flatter, solid colored theme. Most transparency effects were removed from the interface, aside from the taskbar, which maintains transparency (but no longer has a blur effect). Flip 3D was also removed; now toggles between apps.
Pre-release versions of Windows 8 used an updated version of Aero Glass with a flatter, squared look. However, the Glass theme was ultimately removed, as Microsoft designers wanted to avoid skeuomorphism. The desktop interface on the final release of Windows 8 was modified to incorporate elements of the Metro design language; in comparison to Windows 7, the interface adopted a flatter look with almost no transparency effects, fewer rounded edges, and solid colored window borders designed to attract more attention to the content of a window.
Features.
For the first time since the release of Windows 95, Microsoft completely revised its user interface guidelines, covering aesthetics, common controls such as buttons and radio buttons, task dialogs, wizards, common dialogs, control panels, icons, fonts, user notifications, and the "tone" of text used. 
Aero Glass theme.
On Windows Vista and Windows 7 computers that meet certain hardware and software requirements, the Aero Glass theme is used by default, primarily incorporating various animation and transparency effects into the desktop using hardware acceleration and the Desktop Window Manager (DWM). In the "Personalize" section added to Control Panel of Windows Vista, users can customize the "glass" effects to either be opaque or transparent, and change the color it is tinted. Enabling Aero Glass also enables other new features, including an enhanced Alt-Tab menu and taskbar thumbnails with live previews of windows, and "Flip 3D", a window switching mechanism which cascades windows with a 3D effect.
Windows 7 features refinements in Aero Glass, including larger window buttons (minimize, maximize, close and query), the replacement of the cyan highlight from window borders with white ones, revised taskbar thumbnails, the ability to manipulate windows by dragging them to the top or sides of the screen (to the side to make it fill half the screen, and to the top to maximize), the ability to hide all windows by hovering the Show Desktop button on the taskbar, and the ability to minimize all other windows by shaking one.
Use of DWM, and by extension the Aero Glass theme, requires a video card with 128 MB of video RAM (or at least 64 MB of video RAM and 1 GB of system RAM for on-board graphics) supporting pixel shader 2.0, and with WDDM-compatible drivers. Aero Glass is also not available in Windows 7 Starter, is only available to a limited extent on Windows Vista Home Basic, and is automatically disabled if a user is detected to be running a non-genuine copy of Windows. Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 also support Aero Glass as part of the "Desktop Experience" component, which is disabled by default. 
On Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, DWM is permanently enabled on all systems; additionally, DWM can now use software rendering on incompatible graphics hardware.
Aero Wizards.
Wizard 97 had been the prevailing standard for wizard design, visual layout, and functionality used in Windows 98 through to Windows Server 2003, as well as most Microsoft products in that time frame. Aero Wizards are the replacement for Wizard 97, incorporating visual updates to match the aesthetics of the rest of Aero, as well as changing the interaction flow.
More specifically:
Notifications.
Notifications allow an application or operating system component with an icon in the notification area to create a pop-up window with some information about an event or problem. These windows, first introduced in Windows 2000 and known colloquially as "balloons", are similar in appearance to the speech balloons that are commonly seen in comics. Balloons were often criticized in prior versions of Windows due to their intrusiveness, especially with regard to how they interacted with full-screen applications such as games (the entire application was minimized as the bubble came up). Notifications in Aero aim to be less intrusive by gradually fading in and out, and not appearing at all if a full-screen application or screensaver is being displayed—in these cases, notifications are queued until an appropriate time. Larger icons and multiple font sizes and colors are also introduced with Aero's notification windows.
Font.
The Segoe UI typeface is the new default font for Aero with languages that use Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic character sets. The default font size is also increased from 8pt to 9pt to improve readability. In the Segoe UI typeface prior to Windows 8, the numeral zero ("0") is narrow, while capital letter "O" is wider (Windows 8's Segoe UI keeps this difference), and numeral one ("1") has a top hook, while capital letter "I" has equal crown and base (Windows 8's "1" has no base, and the "I" does not have a crown or base).
Icons.
Aero's base icons were designed by The Iconfactory, which had previously designed Windows XP icons.
Phrasing tone.
The Vista User Experience Guidelines also address the issue of "tone" in the writing of text used with the Aero user interface. Prior design guidelines from Microsoft had not done much to address the issue of how user interface text is phrased, and as such, the way that information and requests are presented to the user had not been consistent between parts of the operating system.
The guidelines for Vista and its applications suggest messages that present technically accurate advice concisely, objectively, and positively, and assume an intelligent user motivated to solve a particular problem. Specific advice includes the use of the second person and the active voice (e.g. "Print the photos on your camera") and avoidance of words like "please", "sorry" and "thank you".

Chuon Nath

Samdech Sangha Raja Jhotañano Chuon Nath (; 11 March 1883 – 25 September 1969) is the late "Kana Mahanikaya" Supreme Patriarch of Cambodia. Amongst his achievements is his effort in conservation of the Khmer language in the form of the Khmer dictionary. His protection of Khmer identity and history in the form of the national anthem, Nokor Reach and Savada Khmer are also amongst his contribution to the country.
Conserving the Khmer language.
Som Dech Nath was the head of a reformist movement in the Khmer Buddhist Sangha which developed a rationalist-scholastic model of Buddhism, rooted in linguistic studies of the Pali Canon. This new movement, known as Dhammayuttika Nikaya, influenced young Khmer monks in the early 20th century. The new movmenet also cultivated Khmer-language identity and culture, giving rise to the notion of Cambodian nationalism.
Nath pushed for a series of innovations in the Khmer Sangha beginning in the early twentieth century: the use of print for sacred texts (rather than traditional methods of hand-inscribing palm-leaf manuscripts); a higher degree of expertise in Pali and Sanskrit studies among monks; a vision of orthodoxy based on teaching of Vinaya texts for both monks and lay-people; and modernization of teaching methods for Buddhist studies.
He also oversaw the translation of the entire Buddhist Pali canon into Khmer language; and the creation of the Khmer language dictionary.
The French set up its protectorate over Cambodia and intended to replace the Khmer language with its own through the so-called "pseudo-French intellectuals." This intention rallied many Cambodian scholars to the course of conserving the Khmer language; one such scholar was Nath. A son of farmers who later became a monk, Nath dedicated his life to upholding Buddhism and the conservation of Khmer language in the country that was highly influenced by French colonialism. He had an extensive knowledge of the Khmer language. He was probably the most famous and most knowledgeable monk Cambodia had ever had. A master in Buddha’s teaching, he was very well known around the Buddhism circle as well as very adept at languages. Throughout his life he encouraged the use of "Khmerization" in both public education and religions. What Nath meant by "Khmerization" was he wanted to derive new Khmer words from its ancestral roots, the Pali and Sanskrit languages. For example, when the train arrived first in Cambodia, there was no Khmer word for the train. Nath thus derived the word for train from Sanskrit and Pali word of "Ayomoyo" which means something that is made of metal. Together with the word "Yana" which means vehicle, came the Khmer word for train which we know today as "Ayaksmeyana", pronounced Ayak-smey-yean.
However, Nath’s Khmerization was not overall accepted by all Khmers. Scholars such as Keng Vannsak who were pro-French did not find the kind of Khmer words derived from Pali and Sanskrit to be convenient. They revolutionized another kind of derivation which they want to adopt normalized French word into Khmer vocabulary. The only major change was to use Khmer alphabet to write the word rather than using the Roman alphabets used by the French. But despite opposition, Nath’s Khmerization succeeded. He was a member of the original committee granted royal order to compile a Khmer dictionary in 1915 and was credited as the founder of the dictionary as he pushed for and finally succeeded in printing the first edition of the current Khmer dictionary in 1938.
Nath’s other contribution to Cambodia include the current national anthem, Nokor Reach. Nokor Reach was written to correspond to the motto of the nation, "Nation, Religion, King" as well as demonstrate the grandeur and the mighty past of the Khmer nation.

I'm Just a Kid

"I'm Just a Kid" is the debut single by French-Canadian pop-punk band Simple Plan, written by Pierre Bouvier. It appeared on their debut album "No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls". It was featured in the films "Grind", "The New Guy", and "Cheaper by the Dozen".
Music video.
The music video is about how an average guy (DJ Qualls) attempts to impress a popular girl (Eliza Dushku) by attempting to perform dangerous stunts, but other, more popular boys interrupt to take his place. They fail to succeed and are injured, and the main characters look on with pained expressions of pity and a certain amount of schadenfreude. There is also a surreal sequence, in which the archetypal popular boy, played by Sebastien Lefebvre, is hit by a school bus. The video was made with actors from the movie "The New Guy", such as DJ Qualls and Tony Hawk. As such, it was released as an extra on the DVD of "The New Guy". As well, in the video, there is a clip of Tony Hawk taken from the final football game in the movie. Most of the scenes in the video were filmed at Long Beach Polytechnic High School in Long Beach, California.

National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research

The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research or NIWA (Māori: Taihoro Nukurangi), is a Crown Research Institute of New Zealand. Established in 1992, NIWA conducts commercial and non-commercial research across a broad range of disciplines in the environmental sciences. It also maintains nationally and, in some cases, internationally important environmental monitoring networks, databases, and collections.
As of 30 June 2008, NIWA had 753 staff spread across 15 sites in New Zealand and one in Perth, Australia. Its head office is in Auckland, with regional offices in Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch, Nelson, and Lauder (Central Otago). It also has small field teams, focused mostly on hydrology, stationed in Rotorua, Turangi, Napier, Wanganui, Greymouth, Alexandra, and Dunedin. NIWA maintains a fleet of about 30 vessels for freshwater, marine, and atmospheric research.
Mission statement.
"[NIWA's] mission is to conduct leading environmental science to enable the sustainable management of natural resources for New Zealand and the planet."
History.
NIWA was formed as a stand-alone company in 1992 as part of a government initiative to restructure the New Zealand science sector. Its foundation staff came mainly from the former Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Meteorological Service. The Fisheries Research Division of the former Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries joined NIWA in 1995.
NIWA is currently structured as a limited liability company under the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992
Research programmes.
NIWA focuses on atmospheric, marine, and freshwater research – extending from the deep ocean to the upper atmosphere – in New Zealand, the Pacific, Southern Ocean, and Antarctica.
NIWA’s research spans diverse fields:
Research projects are undertaken in collaboration with local and central government agencies, other Crown Research Institutes, industry, private research companies, and universities in New Zealand and the rest of the world. In 2007–08, NIWA scientists were involved in more than 970 collaborations and NIWA had formal links with some 150 overseas institutions. Within New Zealand, NIWA has close working relationships with many Māori entities (85 entities in 2007-08) through its Māori environmental research group, Te Kūwaha o Taihoro Nukurangi.
Most of NIWA’s revenue is from contestable research funding and commercial consultancy work. As of 30 June 2008, NIWA had a revenue of $120 million and assets of $109 million.
NIWA’s scientists.
NIWA’s greatest asset is its scientists, who come from all over the world and hold expertise in a wide range of disciplines, from atmospheric science to zoology. In 2007-08, NIWA employed 501 permanent researchers. In that year, NIWA researchers contributed to more than 1200 science publications and delivered more than 1000 science presentations. In 2007, 12 NIWA climate scientists - Greg Bodeker, Matt Dunn, Rod Henderson, Darren King, Keith Lassey, David Lowe, Brett Mullan, Kath O'Shaughnessy, Guy Penny, Jim Renwick, Jim Salinger and David Wratt - shared the Nobel Peace Prize with other contributors to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
NIWA scientists also play a role in training future scientists (supervising 41 PhD and 10 MSc students in 2007-08) and in public outreach through talking about their science to community groups, school children, media, and the general public. They also contribute to professional development training courses for environmental agencies in New Zealand and the South Pacific.
On Thursday 23 April 2009, Jim Salinger was summarily dismissed by NIWA, allegedly for telephoning a television weatherman to discuss the weather without permission from his managers.
Research facilities.
Included among NIWA’s wide-ranging research facilities are a gas laboratory which uses gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to assess the composition of gases and their isotopes in samples of air and water, and isotope analysis of solid material; an ecotoxicology laboratory for assessing the effects of contaminants – such as heavy metals, pesticides, and wastes – on aquatic organisms; and aquaculture research facilities at Bream Bay in Northland and Mahanga Bay, Wellington.
NIWA’s atmospheric climate research station at Lauder, in Central Otago, is the only fully instrumented Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude site in the global Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change, providing vital information on ozone depletion and climate change. It operates one of only four instruments in the world capable of measuring all the molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) in an entire air ‘column’, from the ground to the top of the atmosphere.
NIWA also runs a Cray supercomputer for environmental forecasting, climate modelling, ocean circulation modelling, and fisheries modelling.
NIWA vessels.
Foremost among NIWA’s 30 vessels is 70 metre deepwater research vessel RV "Tangaroa", New Zealand’s only ice-strengthened research ship. he 28 metre RV "Kaharoa" is used mainly for coastal research, but has gone further afield to deploy ocean-profiling Argo floats, from Chile to Mauritius.
Environmental Monitoring Networks.
NIWA maintains a range of monitoring networks that collect long-term environmental data, including climate information, sea level, river flows, water quality, and freshwater fish distributions and habitats.
As at 1 August 2008, NIWA had 1339 operational stations in its climate and water monitoring networks, spread throughout New Zealand, including the Chatham Islands. NIWA also holds data from more than 3000 closed stations, many of which have long usable records. The National Water Quality Network, for instance, has been operating at 77 sites since the 1970s. It can now show long-term trends in water quality.
Environmental data.
NIWA maintains several databases containing long-term records of environmental data, and species records. The National Climate Database, for instance, contains more than 250 million individual measurements (as of August 2008), with records dating back to the 1850s. The New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database records the occurrence of fish in fresh waters of New Zealand, including major offshore islands, and details of their habitats. As of June 2009, the database included more than 28 000 records. Among other things, these databases are used to detect geographical and temporal trends in the state of the environment.
NIWA holds the longest continuous record of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere, measured at Baring Head, near Wellington, since the 1970s. Along with equivalent measurements from the Northern Hemisphere, taken at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, these records are used to model the effects of atmospheric CO2 on global climate.
The information in NIWA’s databases is in high demand. In the 2007-08 financial year, for instance, NIWA responded to more than 350 000 requests for data from its databases. In July 2007, NIWA allowed free online access to archived data on climate, lake levels, river flow, sea levels, water quality, and freshwater fish.
NIWA Invertebrate Collection.
The NIWA Invertebrate Collection is the largest repository of marine invertebrate (animals without a backbone) specimens from the New Zealand region, southwestern Pacific, and the Ross Sea (Antarctica). It holds representatives of almost all phyla in the New Zealand region. Collected over the last 50 years and still growing, the collection holds several million specimens, ranging from single-celled organisms to giant corals. As of June 2009, it included 993 type specimens of species new to science. The collection is used by scientists, teachers, and journalists throughout New Zealand and the world.
Natural Hazards Centre.
In 2002 NIWA teamed up with the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Science to create the Natural Hazards Centre as a New Zealand resource for all hazards information and advice. The centre develops systems to monitor and predict the following hazards: earthquakes, tsunami, floods, storms, landslides, coastal flooding and waves, coastal erosion, and volcanoes.

Djamila Bouhired

Djamila Bouhired (, born 1935) is an Algerian militant.
Bouhired is a nationalist who opposed the French colonial rule of Algeria. She was raised in a middle-class family, having attended a French school. She would go on in her youth to join the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) while a student activist. There she worked as a liaison officer and personal assistant of FLN commander Yacef Saadi in Algiers. Despite her fame and being widely considered as one the faces of the Algerian Revolution, very little is known about her life.
Algerian Independence Movement.
Djamila Bouherid was born to a middle-class family in colonial Algeria. When she was still a student in a French school, she discovered her revolutionary spirit. When all the Algerian students repeated every morning "France is our mother", Bouhired would stand up and scream "Algeria Is Our Mother!" Of course, she was punished for this by the principal. From this time, Bouhired was drawn to the revolutionary cause. Her brothers having already been involved with the underground nationalist struggle, Bouhired was quick to join and her profile would quickly rise in stature. During the revolution she worked as a liaison agent for the commander Saadi Yacef.
In June 1957, prior to a big demonstration that was planned to occur, she was captured by the French and, she claims, tortured for information about that demonstration. She did not divulge any information under torture and reportedly repeated "Algeria Is Our Mother" while being tortured (the information is based on her own account and cannot be independently verified).
In July 1957 she was tried for allegedly bombing a cafe, which killed 11 civilians inside. At the time a French lawyer named Jacques Vergès, sympathetic to the plight of Algerians, heard of her case and decided to represent her. In what would be a historic trial, Vergès accused the government of themselves having committed the acts charged in his defense, waging a public relations campaign on her behalf. Despite his efforts, she was convicted and sentenced to death by the guillotine. Partly due to his strategy, the French government found itself under overwhelming pressure from the world's public opinion, and the execution was postponed indefinitely, with Bouhired imprisoned in France. As the end of the war drew near, she was released along with many other Algerian prisoners. Vergès claimed to have become a target of the French colonial government, which allegedly launched several failed assassination attempts against him, including a bomb placed in his apartment and another in his car. Bouhired and Vergès would be married a year after Algeria's independence, with his having converted to Islam by this time, taking the first name Mansoor. The couple would have two children, Meriem and Liess Vergès. Bouhired became chairwoman of the Algerian Women Association in independent Algeria, and was constantly at odds with then-Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella. Later she and her husband moved to Paris.
Period of Imprisonment.
Very few details about what transpired during her imprisonment can be independently confirmed. The only information available is what Bouhired and sources related to her have claimed afterwards. What she stated is that she was subjected to torture during her imprisonment and that the torture was not limited to her, that her brothers were also subject to torture, one of them having been tortured in front of their mother.
Present day.
Djamila Bouhired currently resides in the capital of Algeria, Algiers and continues to be a militant for several causes of which she participates in protest and marches.
In Popular Culture.
She was one of the trio of FLN female bombers depicted in the 1966 film "The Battle of Algiers". She was also depicted in the film "Jamila the Algerian" (1958) by Egyptian director Youssef Chahine and in Terror's Advocate, a documentary film about Jacques Vergès.

Oswald de Andrade

José Oswald de Souza Andrade (January 11, 1890 – October 22, 1954) was a Brazilian poet and polemicist. He was born and spent most of his life in São Paulo.
Andrade was one of the founders of Brazilian modernism and a member of the Group of Five, along with Mário de Andrade, Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral and Menotti del Picchia. He participated in the Week of Modern Art ("Semana de Arte Moderna").
Andrade is very important too for his manifesto of critical Brazilian nationalism, "Manifesto Antropófago" ("Cannibal Manifesto"), published in 1928. Its argument is that Brazil's history of "cannibalizing" other cultures is its greatest strength, while playing on the modernists' primitivist interest in cannibalism as an alleged tribal rite. Cannibalism becomes a way for Brazil to assert itself against European postcolonial cultural domination. The "Manifesto's" iconic line is "Tupi or not Tupi: that is the question." The line is simultaneously a celebration of the Tupi, who had been at times accused of cannibalism (most notoriously by Hans Staden), and an instance of cannibalism: it eats Shakespeare.
Born into a wealthy bourgeois family, Andrade used his money and connections to support numerous modernist artists and projects. He sponsored the publication of several major novels of the period, produced a number of experimental plays, and supported several painters, including Tarsila do Amaral, with whom he had a long affair, and Lasar Segall. His role in the modernist community was made somewhat awkward, however, by his feud with Mário de Andrade, which lasted from 1929 (after Oswald de Andrade published a pseudonymous essay mocking Mário for effeminacy) until Mário de Andrade's untimely death in 1945.

Savez izviđača Bosne i Hercegovine

The Savez izviđača Bosne i Hercegovine ("Scout Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina") is the national Scouting organisation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was founded on 17 December 2011 through the merger of the three constituent organisation of its predecessor, the Savjet izviđačkih organizacija u Bosni i Hercegovini ("Council of Scout Associations in Bosnia and Herzegovina"), which was a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement since 1999. The coeducational Council of Scout Associations in Bosnia and Herzegovina has 1,250 members as of 2011.
History of Scouting in Bosnia.
Scouting under the Austro-Hungarian Empire in Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in 1915. In his book, "What Scouts Can Do: More Yarns", Baden-Powell wrote about Bosnia before the First World War; in a section "Biking in Bosnia" he provides a fascinating picture of this war-torn land. Bosnia-Herzegovina, as part of Yugoslavia, helped found the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922 and remained a member until Scouting in Yugoslavia was coopted by the SFR Yugoslavia in 1950 into Savez Izviđača Jugoslavije, at which time WOSM membership was forfeited.
The Council of Scout Associations in Bosnia and Herzegovina comprised the "Savez Izviđača Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine" (Scout Association of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and the "Savez Izviđača Republike Srpske" (Scout Association of the Republic of Srpska). Both Scout Associations agreed to work together to form a federation and join WOSM together, and met to finalize matters presented to WOSM for consideration of membership. WOSM granted full membership to Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 1999. In 2000, after the establishment of the Brčko District, a third association, the "Savez izviđača Distrikta Brčko" (Scout Association of the Brčko District) joined the council.
In 2011, the three member organizations of the council agreed to form a unified association, the "Savez izviđača Bosne i Hercegovine" (Scout Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina). The Scout Motto is "Буди Спреман" ("Budi Spreman"), translating as "Be Prepared" in the dialect of each ethnic group. The noun for a single Scout is interchangeably Skaut and Izviđač.
Emblems.
The membership badge of the council is often seen in black-and-white so as not to show ethnic leaning of the various groups. The emblem of Savez Izviđača Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine incorporates the gold-on-green color scheme of the coat of arms of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the maple leaf design of the original Savez Izviđača Jugoslavije. The emblem of Savez Izviđača Republike Srpske incorporates elements of the coat of arms of Republika Srpska.

15 Aquilae is the Flamsteed designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Aquila. It has the Bayer designation h Aquilae. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 5.41, meaning that it is faintly visible to the naked eye. It has a nearby optical companion, HD 177442. The distance to 15 Aquilae can be estimated from its annual parallax shift of 11.27 mas, yielding a range of approximately from Earth with a 9 light-year margin of error.
With a stellar classification of K1 III, the spectrum of 15 Aquilae matches a giant star with an estimated age of roughly four billion years. At this stage of its evolution, the outer atmosphere of the star has expanded to 14 times the radius of the Sun. It is radiating 83 times the Sun's luminosity into space at an effective temperature of 4,560 K. This heat gives it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star.
This star is most likely a member of the thin disk population of the Milky Way. It is orbiting through the galaxy with an eccentricity of 0.06, which carries it as close as to the Galactic Core, and as far away as . The orbital inclination carries it no more than from the galactic plane.

Dada (band)

Dada is a three piece rock band from California (United States). The band is made up of Michael Gurley (guitar/co-lead vocals), Joie Calio (bass/co-lead vocals) and Phil Leavitt (drums).
The band's songs feature both Michael and Joie sharing the vocals on each song. The group write highly melodic, harmony laden tunes, and their constant touring with two and a half to three hour performances has won them a wide fanbase.
History.
1992 saw the release of their debut album "Puzzle". First single "Dizz Knee Land" quickly became a staple of radio across the U.S. and reached as far as Australia, where the song and album went on high rotation on national radio station 'Triple J'. "Dizz Knee Land" reached number 5 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart and number 27 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart; "Puzzle" went on to sell more than half a million copies. They toured for the album with bands such as Crowded House and Izzy Stradlin & the Ju Ju Hounds, as well as Sting.
During several of their tours in the late 1990s, Dada performed with an additional musician, Gig McKell, who played rhythm guitar, and also is Michael Gurley's brother. For the past several years, however, Dada has returned to a trio for live performances.
They released the follow-up in 1994, "American Highway Flower". Though the first single from that album "All I Am" spent eight weeks in the modern rock charts their record label at the time (I.R.S. Records) began to collapse. By the release of their third album "El Subliminoso" in 1996, I.R.S. Records had all but folded. In 1997 the band signed to MCA Records and, in 1998, released their fourth full-length studio album simply titled "dada". Their bad luck with record companies continued as the parent company of MCA was sold. They continued touring throughout the U.S. In 1999 the band decided to have a break and played their supposedly final show in Norfolk, Virginia in front of 14,000 fans. 
During their break Joie Calio worked as an A&R scout for MCA Records and wrote a book. Soon afterwards he released his debut solo album "The Complications of Glitter". Michael Gurley and Phil Leavitt formed the band Butterfly Jones and they released the album "Napalm Springs". Phil Leavitt also had a short stint with the Blue Man Group during this time.
2003 saw the return of dada. They began playing live shows again and recorded one of them in Santa Ana, California. They released the show on CD, titled "Dada Live: Official Bootleg (Vol. 1)". They spent seven weeks touring the CD across the US. In 2004, dada released their fifth album "How To Be Found". Technically, "How To Be Found" was not a "new" album, but merely a compilation album that gathered all the leftover songs from the highly productive sessions that produced their 1998 self-titled album "dada". They once again toured extensively across the US. Dada spent much of 2005 working on their next studio album, playing just three gigs during November. They played selected dates mainly on the East Coast of America during February - April 2006.
During much of the band's tenure, Michael Gurley has struggled with carpal tunnel syndrome. In order to continue playing, Gurley was forced to make some changes - these included using light gauge strings and tuning the instrument down a half step, as well as icing his wrists frequently to help with the pain.
In November of 2006, the band released an EP titled "A Friend Of Pat Robertson". They commenced 2007 with shows at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles followed by shows in Milwaukee, Chicago and Minneapolis in April.
In June 2008 Joie Calio's band X Levitation Cult released the CD "Happiness in Hell".
On May 3, 2010, Joie Calio posted on his Facebook profile that "Dada is actually recording a new record - really! Its sounding good too. We've decided to stay focused on the writing/recording of this new record for now and hold off on any big tour plans". The band began a club tour later in the year. For unknown reasons, work came to a stand still on the new dada album in 2010 and to date, none of the recordings from those sessions have been released.
In 2011, using studio time originally booked for dada, Joie Calio and Phil Leavitt recorded a new album together under the name, 7Horse. The debut 7Horse album, titled "Let The 7Horse Run", was independently released late in 2011, and a tour of the U.S. followed early in 2012.
Late in 2012, dada announced a rather extensive "20th Anniversary Tour" of the U.S. that was slated to begin in January of 2013. It was also announced that 7Horse would be the opener for all shows.

Green brands

Green brands are those brands that consumers associate with environmental conservation and sustainable business practices. 
Such brands appeal to consumers who are becoming more aware of the need to protect the environment. A green brand can add a unique selling point to a product and can boost corporate image. However, if a company is found or perceived to overstate its green practices its green brand may be criticised as greenwash.
Increase in green brands.
Ethical consumerism has led to an increase in green brands. In the food and drinks industry only 5 green brand products were launched in 2002, increasing to 328 in 2007 (Mintel global database).
Packaging.
In the case of consumer brands packaging can be a key element in communicating a green brand. This is because packaging communicates information to the consumer at the point-of-sale, and because of the environmental impact of the packaging itself.
Companies may claim sustainable packaging, recycled and/or recyclable material, or reduce excess packaging. Packaging is of especially high brand importance when the packaging is part of the aesthetic appeal of the product and brand, as in the case of the cosmetics and toiletries sector. Packaging material may have to not only reinforce environmental credentials, but also communicate the high-quality and luxury image of the brand.
Advertisement and marketing standards concerns.
In Europe concerns have been raised that consumers might be confused or mislead as a result of a recent increase in green brands. Because green brands can add a unique selling point there is little consistency from brand to brand. In the food and drinks industry it has been observed that companies are reluctant to use existing and widely recognised green logos, such as the mobius loop, because using their own makes the brand more easily distinguishable for the consumer.
In Britain, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has warned consumers in mid-2007, that some "green" claims might not be authentic. The ASA stated that green claims have become noticeably more prevalent in advertisement, and has investigated and upheld several complaints regarding "unsubstantiated environmental claims". The ASA Director General has stated that "the ASA needs to see robust evidence to back up any eco-friendly claims". 
The ASA in Britain has also raised concerns that as awareness about climate change increase among consumers, the cases of unsubstantiated carbon claims (e.g. carbon emissions and carbon neutral claims) rises. The ASA has upheld a number of complaints against energy companies, including Scottish and Southern Energy car manufacturers, including Toyota, Lexus and Volkswagen, and airlines, including EasyJet, for misleading claims regarding carbon emissions and carbon neutrality. 
Recent cases before the British ASA involved environmental claims such as "local". In December 2006 for example the ASA upheld a complaint against Tesco, where the company advertised British products as "local", which the ASA ruled to be misleading because in this particular case the consumers were likely to interpret “local” as referring to their immediate surrounding region. 
In August 2008 the British ASA ruled that Shell had misled the public in an advertisement which claimed that a $10bn oil sands project in Alberta, northern Canada, was a "sustainable energy source". The ASA upheld a complaint by the World Wide Fund for Nature about Shell's advert in the Financial Times. Explaining the ruling the ASA stated that "We considered that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) best practice guidance on environmental claims stated that green claims should not 'be vague or ambiguous, for instance by simply trying to give a good impression about general concern for the environment. Claims should always avoid the vague use of terms such as 'sustainable', 'green', 'non-polluting' and so on." Furthermore the ASA ruling stated "Defra had made that recommendation because, although 'sustainable' was a widely used term, the lack of a universally agreed definition meant that it was likely to be ambiguous and unclear to consumers. Because we had not seen data that showed how Shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change, we concluded that the ad was misleading"
In the United States the Federal Trade Commission issues the "Green Guides" (last updated 2012) - environmental marketing guidelines. The guidelines give advice on the types of substantiation needed to support environmental claims, and give examples of claims that are to be avoided. The Federal Trade Commission has recognised that these guidelines need updating, as for example they currently contain no guidance on carbon neutrality, or the terms sustainable or renewable. The Green Guides do contain guidance on the term recyclable, recycled and biodegradable.
The marketing and brand building experiences of many American green brands was documented in the book "The Gort Cloud" by Richard Seireeni, 2009. The gort cloud refers to the green community that provides support and a market to green brands.

27 Aquilae

27 Aquilae (27 Aql) is the Flamsteed designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Aquila. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.49, which is faintly visible to the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, this star is at a distance of from Earth, give or take a 20 light-year margin of error. At this distance, the brightness of the star is diminished from extinction caused by interstellar gas and dust.
The spectrum of 27 Aquilae fits a stellar classification of B9 III, with the luminosity class of III typically indicating this is an evolved giant star. As it lies within the field of view of the CoRoT satellite, close observation have been made of its luminosity. The star shows a multiperiodic variability with at least six pulsation frequencies discovered. It has a high rate of rotation with a projected rotational velocity of 55 km/s. The outer atmosphere is radiating energy into space at an effective temperature of around 11,500 K, giving it the blue-white hue of a B-type star.

35 Aquilae

35 Aquilae is the Flamsteed designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Aquila. It has the Bayer designation c Aquilae. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 5.8, which means it is a faint star but visible to the naked eye from dark suburban or rural skies. It has an annual parallax shift of 16.34 mas that is caused by the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This yields a distance estimate of , give or take a 4 light-year margin of error. At this distance, the visual magnitude is diminished by 0.26 from extinction caused by interstellar gas and dust.
The spectrum of 35 Aquilae fits a stellar classification of A0 V, indicating it is an A-type main sequence star. Compared to the Sun, it has 210% of the mass and 180% of the radius. As such, it is much brighter than the Sun, emitting 14 times the luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 8,939 K. This heat causes it to glow with the white-hot hue of an A-type star. 35 Aquilae is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 110 km/s.
In 1994 it was discovered that 35 Aquilae is a variable star with a pulsation period of just 30 minutes. It was determined to be a Delta Scuti variable, which is a type of star found on the instability strip that undergoes short period pulsations. Observation with the Spitzer Space Telescope shows that 35 Aquilae is radiating an excess level of infrared radiation for a star of its type. This excess may be explained by the heating of nearby interstellar dust belonging to a diffuse cloud of material that the star is passing through. This interaction may also explain the Lambda Boötis categorization for this star.

This is a so-called mild barium star, as identified by the mild presence of an absorption line of singly-ionized barium atoms at a wavelength of 455.4 nm. Such stars display an atmospheric overabundance of carbon and the heavy elements produced by the s-process, which was most likely transferred into the atmosphere by a wide binary stellar companion. However, in the case of 24 Aquilae, the abundances of heavy elements are near normal.
At an estimated age of a half billion years, 24 Aquilae is a giant star with a stellar classification of K0 IIIa. It has more than double the mass of the Sun and shines with 63 times the Sun's luminosity. It is radiating this energy into space from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 4,810 K.

Betty Leslie-Melville

Betty Leslie-Melville (née McDonnell) (March 7, 1927 – September 23, 2005) was an American conservationist. She was instrumental in creating sanctuaries to preserve the subspecies of the Rothschild's giraffe in Kenya. Often called the "Giraffe Lady", she spent much of her life living and working in Kenya protecting and caring for the Rothschild's giraffe population there, primarily through a breeding programme established at her residence, Giraffe Manor. During her time working there, the Rothschild's giraffe population grew from about one hundred twenty to over four hundred.
Along with her husband Jock Leslie-Melville and their adopted giraffe Daisy, she was the subject of the film "The Last Giraffe" (1979) with Susan Anspach playing Betty.
As part of their fund-raising efforts, Betty and Jock Leslie-Melville collaborated on a series of books about animals, most of them characterised by Betty's rather breathless style. "Raising Daisy Rothschild" (1977) "the story of two delightful young people and how they raised and grew to love a young giraffe... or two" became a best-seller. More animal stories followed: "Elephant Have Right of Way" (1973), "There's a Rhino in the Rose Bed", "Mother" (1973), "That Nairobi Affair" (1975) and "Walter Warthog" (1989), a children's story about the tame warthog they named after their friend Walter Cronkite, the CBS news anchorman. The books helped to raise more funds for the Giraffe Centre they set up at Langata, Kenya in 1983.

William N. McNair

William N. McNair (November 7, 1880 – September 13, 1948), served as the 49th Mayor of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1934 to 1936.
Early life.
Originally from Middletown, Pennsylvania, McNair graduated from Gettysburg College in 1900, earned a law degree from the University of Michigan in 1903, and became an attorney in Pittsburgh in 1904. He tried his hand at politics several times, losing successive elections before finally winning office.
Pittsburgh politics.
At the city's highest office in 1934, it was soon apparent though why McNair had never won a public office before. McNair almost from the beginning had a confrontational relationship with City Council. At first much of his antics were viewed as the actions of a man that cared about the "little guy"; soon though much of his actions just ground the city's ability to govern to a halt in heated, endless and dramatic debate over the most nuanced issues. During his fractious leadership McNair even set up his office in the ornate lobby of the City-County Building to display his "independence" from council and the city bureaucracy.
He continued to be a lightning rod during his administration, being arrested at one point for refusing to return what a judge found to be an unlawful fine he had assessed a citizen. On November 27, 1934 Governor George Earl cut off funds to the city after continued difficulty dealing with McNair. Later when he received word that the governor was considering impeachment proceedings against him he installed a bed in the mayor's office and conducted press conferences from it. In 1936, he traveled to Washington, D.C., and took part in congressional hearings on taxes. His position of repealing all federal taxes at the time was voiced so zealously that a "New York Times" report recounts a Capitol Police Officer was called before McNair voluntarily left the hearing.
The most fateful event for his political career took the city by force on St. Patrick's day 1936 when it suffered from the worst flooding in its history. The event and the chaotic nature that McNair had plunged the city into sealed his fate. Political opponents accused him of impropriety in various dealings, and he was jailed for three days in April on charges of operating a numbers game.
He resigned on a whim on October 6, 1936, promptly rescinded his resignation then demanded to once again be sworn in as mayor, but by that time the city council and the rest of the city had grown tired of his controversial leadership, choosing instead to validate his earlier resignation and let Cornelius Scully assume the mayor's office.
Later life.
McNair became a sort of political sideshow after he left office, continuing to run for offices unsuccessfully and giving political speeches and rallies for various causes. He died in St. Louis, Missouri in 1948 during a political rally and is buried in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

Cornelius D. Scully

Cornelius Decator Scully (March 11, 1878 – September 22, 1952), served as Mayor of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, from 1936 to 1946.
Early life.
Scully was born in Pittsburgh in 1878, ascending into public service by becoming City Solicitor before running for City Council. It was his tenure and leadership of council that in 1936 catapulted him to the mayor's office during the contentious administration of his predecessor William McNair, with whom Scully had often feuded.
Pittsburgh Mayor's Office.
Scully led Pittsburgh during major transformations in its history. By the mid-1930s Pittsburgh was in the process of making progress on pollution and smoke controls, this in the era of the area being referred to as the "Smoky City". During his administration many steps were taken to clean the city up including the opening of new public parks (Mellon, Moore and Pioneer parks). He also concentrated on projects to supply the city with pure mountain water. The oncoming Allied powers industrial needs of World War II (already gearing up in Europe and Asia by the time Scully took the oath of office), put many of his environmental reforms on hold until his successor Lawrence took office after the war. Pittsburgh's mills were said to run 24 hours a day 7 days a week, even on Christmas Day, to supply the forces of freedom during the war. The massive workload of the area's factories, mills and shipyards, while a point of immense pride among Pennsylvanians, only reinforced negative stereotypes of the city as a polluted and dirty environment.
Scully put some of his dreams of Pittsburgh's beauty and clean air on hold for the needs of his wartime country; on other issues he made much progress for the city. Some of his successes included forwarding the Home Rule Charter to serious consideration in Harrisburg, allowing the city more autonomy from the Commonwealth. He also improved infrastructure, implementing the use of parking meters downtown and rebuilding the expressway-like downtown thruway Bigelow Blvd.
Controversies.
Mayor Scully owned a 210 acre apple and peach farm outside Shepherdstown, West Virginia and would leave the city on most weekends to spend time out of state. In three straight years he was waylayed at the farm because of a 1941 car accident resulting in a broken jaw, a 1942 whooping cough bout that had him out of the city and most infamously him being caught still making the 350 mile roundtrip with the wrong car and a expired war time gas rationing sticker which got him sentenced to 3 months without use of his personal car and restricted use of the city's $5,000 limo. It was also revealed that the mayor was keeping three ration books that gave him more gas then the average citizen could get through rations over an almost 3 year period. Just weeks prior the mayor conducted a gas rationing crackdown on city residents which netted 700 violations of small amounts, adding to the public outcry of a mayor that was keeping 3 books and expired ration stickers while using cars to drive out of state on a weekly basis. 
Mayor Scully attempted to defend himself by stating that he had to make the trip so he could keep up his victory garden, however it was then revealed that only 3 of his 113 acre farm in suburban Baldwin was being cultivated. One citizen lampooned the mayor by declaring that he would have his "victory garden" in Canada.
The resulting feeding frenzy in the press had the city's public works director tell reporters to "go jump in a creek" when they requested to audit the city's ration books (2 of which the mayor had used).
Later life.
As late as 1948 Scully served on the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Sanitary Authority. Mayor Scully died in 1952 in retirement at Winchester, Virginia.

Entrepreneurial network

In business, entrepreneurial networks are social organizations offering different types of resources to start or improve entrepreneurial projects. Having adequate human resources is a key factor for entrepreneurial achievements. Combined with leadership, the entrepreneurial network is an indispensable kind of social network not only necessary to properly run the business or project, but also to differentiate the business from similar projects. 
Purpose.
The goal of most entrepreneurial networks is to bring together a broad selection of professionals and resources that complement each other's endeavors. Initially a key priority is to aid successful business launches. Subsequently provide motivation, direction and increase access to opportunities and other skill sets. Promotion of each members talents and services both within the network and out in the broader market increases opportunities for all participants.
One of the key needs of any startup is capital, and often entrepreneurial networks focus on providing such financial resources, particularly tailored to their membership demographic.
Entrepreneurial networks may also become community involved, endorsing reforms, legislation or other municipal drives that accommodate their organization's goals.

Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights

The Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (CDLR; Arabic: لجنة الدفاع عن الحقوق الشرعية) was a Saudi dissident group created in 1993 which opposed the Saudi government as un-Islamic.
The CDLR was the first opposition organization in the Kingdom openly challenging the monarchy, accusing the government and senior ulama of not doing enough to protect the legitimate Islamic rights of the Muslims.
History.
Founded in Riyadh on May 3, 1993 by six prominent Islamist scholars and academics, the Committee served to "pass on the views of the Islamist opposition that was rapidly developing in the universities and mosques" of Saudi Arabia. In its Arabic language pronouncements the CDLR maintained a strict "Islamist line," claiming to defend "the rules laid out in the sharia," while its English language statements denounced violations of human rights in Saudi. 
Using the new media such as faxes and Internet efficiently, the CDLR members from the Kingdom and later from the exile in London, challenged the foundation of the Saudi regime, that is, the contract between Saudi rulers and the religious establishment, and criticized the behavior and decisions of the Saudi authorities, and King Fahd in particular. 
Following an interview by the BBC of Mohammad al-Masari, its official spokesman, the CDLR's "signatories and their sympathizers promptly lost their jobs and were thrown into jail." The organization was banned, and its members either left Saudi Arabia or went underground. The CDLR was described as "banned and defunct" by the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association when the latter was created in October 2009.
Following a campaign by Amnesty International, al-Masari was released from prison, and along with Sa'ad Al-Faqih reestablished the CDLR in London, United Kingdom in April 1994. The group made "feverish use" of fax machines and later an Internet website to criticize the ruling family and deliver its message to Saudi Arabia. Their campaign was effective enough that the Saudi royal family threatened the British government with an end to "lucrative defence contracts and other commercial deals" if "Mr Masari was not silenced," and a court battle ensued over Whitehall's attempt to do just that. "In the end, Mr Masari won a legal battle ... but soon after that he faded from public prominence." 
In 1996, Faqih broke with al-Masari who was then a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, "arguing that the Saudi opposition should operate only within the strict boundaries of UK law," and created the rival Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia (MIRA).
Response from the Kingdom.
The Saudi government strongly responded to the activities of the CDLR. In September 1994, two leaders of the CDLR, Salman al-Ouda and Safar al-Hawali were arrested together with a large number of their followers in the city of Burayda, Qasim region. Moreover, Sheikh Abd al-Aziz Ibn Baz issued a fatwa, stating that unless these two leading figures repented their former conduct, they would be banned from lecturing, meetings and cassette-recording.
Criticism.
Scholar Gilles Kepel has described CDLR and Al-Masari as "failing to raise any groundswell of support" within Saudi Arabia and "sadly lacking" in Islamic "doctrinal ... ballast", as became evident after "he was confronted by a barrage of fatwas issued by the regime's ulema supporters." Al-Masari is also criticised for being two-faced, presenting himself as a fighter of human rights abuses and corruption to English language audiences, while regailing Arabic speakers with attacks on Saudi for its lack of shari'a law enforcement and even pronouncing "takfir against all Muslims who obeyed the laws of Riyadh". In particular, his takfir "destroyed much of his support among dissidents." 
In recent years, the CDLR has been denounced by the U.S. government for expressing its "understanding" of the "bombings of U.S. military facilities in 1995 and 1996 and sympathy for the perpetrators." Its splinter group, the Islamic Reform Movement, has also been denounced as having "implicitly condoned the two terrorist attacks as well, arguing that they were a natural outgrowth of a political system that does not tolerate peaceful dissent."
In the US State Department's 2005 report, the CDLR is described as an extremist organization which seeks the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy by force.
Although blacklisted in the US and many EU countries, the CDLR does not appear on any US or UN list of terrorist groups.

Profession (short story)

"Profession" is a novella by Isaac Asimov. The story first appeared in the July 1957 issue of "Astounding Science Fiction" and was the lead story in the 1959 collection "Nine Tomorrows".
Plot summary.
The author presents a centralized Earth society of the sixty-sixth century, in which children are educated by almost instantaneous direct computer/brain interface, a process known as "taping". This system is similar to the BrainCap, a concept later explored by Arthur C. Clarke. Besides educating its own people this way, Earth also supplies educated professionals to other planets, the Outworlds.
Persons in this future society are taught to read at the age of eight and then Educated at the age of eighteen. Each's professional speciality is dictated by an analysis of his or her brain, with no choices allowed to the subject. The best of the Educated people compete in professional "Olympics" in the hope of being "bought" by an advanced Outworld. To stay on Earth is almost an admission of failure. 
George Platen is determined to be a Computer Programmer, a profession in demand, and he hopes to qualify for "export" to a top-flight Outworld. On Reading Day, however, concerns are raised about George's ability to be Educated. On George's Education Day, he is told that his brain is unfit for any form of Education. He is drugged and sent to a House for the Feeble Minded. 
Although not under physical guard, George stays in the House for a year, where the staff tolerates, even encourages his philosophical and intellectual ruminations as a way to pass the time. He is befriended by Omani, who seems to take a personal interest in George's plight. George then determines to escape, to leave and seek out Dr. Antonelli who told him he was feeble-minded, and have it out with him. 
On the lam, George visits the Olympics, which are happening in San Francisco at that time. He meets his primary schoolmate Trevelyan, who has been Taped as a Metallurgist, Nonferrous. Trev is excited about his opportunities but performs poorly on the Beeman spectrograph—his Taping was inadequate regarding the new device—and he is forced to take employment on a fourth-rate Outworld. George, watching Trev bitterly depart, wishes him well. Trev turns and sarcastically asks, "Well, what have you done?" He then shakes George. A passing policeman breaks up the scuffle and asks George for his identity card. His ruse is up, he will be exposed as an Uneducated escapee. 
Suddenly a stranger appears. He gives the policeman his business card and takes possession of George. The stranger introduces himself as Ladislas Ingenescu, Registered Historian. George and Ingenescu enter into a long conversation about history, society, and progress. George impatiently demands and Ingenescu obtains for him an interview with a Novian, an Outworlder on Earth to purchase talent. The Outworlder knows Ingenescu personally. He expresses anger at the Registered Historian (why to a Registered Historian, George wonders?) over Earth continually introducing very minor changes to the Tapes—such as the recent addition of the Beeman spectrograph for Metallurgists—necessitating the Outworlds to keep spending money to stay up to date. The Registered Historian introduces George as someone who thinks he may have a better solution. George contends that people can learn in ways other than being Taped, such as by reading books and in discussion with those who already hold the desired knowledge. This baffles the Outworlder, who sees it only as a source of additional expense. He breaks off their conversation. George is dismayed; the Registered Historian offers condolences.
George is returned to the House and discovers the reality: the House is really an Institute of Higher Studies. Here the cream of the population, those who have the urge and persistence to create, even though they have been told they cannot, are sent to support the advancement of science and civilization. George has been under permanent observation at all times, and it was subtly but deliberately suggested that he escape and seek out the doctor who sent him there. Reflecting on his experiences "outside," George realizes that a man named Beeman would have to have been the inventor of the Beeman spectrograph. Beeman couldn't have been Tape-educated and still have created the new device. Someone has to program the Tapes that program the Educated, "men and women with capacity for original thought." George's "keepers" in the Institute are revealed as sociologists, psychologists, historians, scientists, and other professionals who also demonstrated an innate capacity for original thought but not the stamina to keep fighting to express it. Their job is to help other determined, innovators like George—a small fraction—to avoid the same fate. The future of society is at stake.

Sylvain Lefebvre

Sylvain Jean Lefebvre (born October 14, 1967) is a retired ice hockey defenceman who played on five National Hockey League teams from 1989 to 2003. As of 2012, he is the head coach of the Hamilton Bulldogs in the American Hockey League.
Playing career.
Sylvain Lefebvre signed with the Montreal Canadiens in 1986 and made the team's roster in 1989–90 as an undrafted free agent. He played three seasons with the Habs before being traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for a third round draft pick prior to the start of the 1992–93 season. Lefebvre played two seasons with the Leafs before being traded to the Quebec Nordiques as part of the Wendel Clark-Mats Sundin blockbuster trade on June 28, 1994. Lefebvre played the next five seasons with the Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche before signing a four-year, $10-million US contract with the New York Rangers that secured a club-option for him to play a fifth season at $3 million in the 1999 off-season. Lefebvre's productivity decreased after several injuries, including a shattered index finger which occurred while blocking a shot. The doctor compared the injury to taking a hammer and hitting his finger until the bone is literally shattered into little pieces. Lefebvre's career low came in the 2002–03 season. After four years with the Rangers, Lefebvre left the NHL and decided to join old friend Sebastien Bordeleau for one season to play for the Swiss team SC Bern where he and his team won the cup. He retired shortly thereafter. 
After winning the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 1996, Lefebvre was involved in an incident that attracted media attention. As part of tradition, each player on the Stanley Cup winning team can take personal possession of the trophy for a day during the summer following the championship, a practice that has led to several misadventures. When it was his turn, Lefebvre decided to have his baby daughter, Jade, baptized in it.
Retirement and coaching career.
Lefebvre was named as assistant coach of the American Hockey League's Lake Erie Monsters. On June 4, 2009, the Colorado Avalanche announced that Lefebvre would serve as an assistant coach.
On June 13, 2012, Sylvain Lefebvre became the head coach of the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League (Montreal Canadiens' affiliate).

Formula game

A formula game is an artificial game represented by a fully quantified Boolean formula. Players' turns alternate and the space of possible moves is denoted by bound variables. If a variable is universally quantified, the formula following it has the same truth value as the formula beginning with the universal quantifier regardless of the move taken. If a variable is existentially quantified, the formula following it has the same truth value as the formula beginning with the existential quantifier for at least one move available at the turn. Turns alternate, and a player loses if he cannot move at his turn. In computational complexity theory, the language FORMULA-GAME is defined as all formulas formula_1 such that Player 1 has a winning strategy in the game represented by formula_1. FORMULA-GAME is PSPACE-complete.

Mike Ploog

Michael G. Ploog (born 1942, Mankato, Minnesota, United States) is an American storyboard and comic book artist, and a visual designer for movies.
In comics, Ploog is best known for his work on Marvel Comics' 1970s "Man-Thing" and "The Monster of Frankenstein" series, and as the initial artist on the features "Ghost Rider" and "Werewolf by Night". His style at the time was heavily influenced by the art of Will Eisner, under whom he apprenticed.
Biography.
Early life and career.
Mike Ploog, one of a family of three brothers and a sister, was raised first on a Minnesota farm. He began drawing while a young child whose imagination was fired by such old-time radio dramas as "Sergeant Preston of the Yukon" and "Gunsmoke", and such thriller anthologies as "Inner Sanctum Mysteries" and "Tales of Horror". After his parents divorced and sold the farm when Ploog was about 10 or 11 years old, his mother took the children to live with her in Burbank, California. Ploog entered the U.S. Marine Corps, leaving in 1968, after 10 years. Toward the end of his hitch, he began working on the Corps' "Leatherneck Magazine", doing bits of writing, photography and art.
The following season he was promoted to layout work. "Layout," Ploog recalled in a 1998 interview, "is what happens between storyboarding and actual animation; you're literally composing the scenes. You're more or less designing the background, putting the characters into it so they'll look like they're actually walking on the surface". At Hanna-Barbera the following season, he worked on layouts for the animated series "Motormouse and Autocat" and "Wacky Races", as well as "the first "Scooby-Doo" pilot; nothing spectacular, though. It was okay; it was a salary, y'know? ... I had very few aspirations, because I didn't know where anything I was doing was going to take me".
A Hanna-Barbera colleague passed along a flyer he had gotten from writer-artist Will Eisner seeking an assistant on the military instructional publication "PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly". Ploog was familiar with it from his Marine Corps days, and knew well the art, though not the artist's name. "I'd been copying his work for years", Ploog said, "because I was doing visual aids and training aids for the military for a long time". 
Eisner in 1978 recalled that, "Mike came in working for me in 1967. I was looking for someone who could work on the "PS" magazine ... and Mike sent me his material, or somebody sent it to me, I don't remember which, and I found myself in California, talking Mike into coming to work for us... We had a very happy relationship for maybe two or three years, four years."
Ploog moved to New York City and remained with Eisner for just over two years. As Ploog recalled:
Marvel Comics and Ghost Rider.
Eventually, at the suggestion of Eisner letterer Ben Oda and artist Wally Wood, Ploog broke into comics at Warren Publishing, doing stories for the company's black-and-white horror-comics magazines. A Western sample he showed Marvel got him a callback to draw "Werewolf by Night", which premiered in "Marvel Spotlight" #2 (Feb. 1972). After three issues, the series spun off onto its own book. Ploog then helped launched the initial, Johnny Blaze version of the supernatural motorcyclist Ghost Rider, in "Marvel Spotlight" #5 (Aug. 1972), and drew the next three adventures.
The specifics of the character's creation are disputed. Roy Thomas, a Marvel writer and the editor-in-chief at the time, recalls, 
Friedrich has responded that,
Ploog recalled, in a 2008 interview:
Ploog and writer Gary Friedrich collaborated on the first six issues of Marvel's "The Monster of Frankenstein" (Jan.-Oct. 1973), the initial four of which contained a more faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel than has mostly appeared elsewhere; comics historian Don Markstein said, "It was faithful to the story even to the point of leaving the monster trapped in the ice at the end — so of course, the fifth issue began with him being rescued." In a 1989 interview, Ploog said, "I really enjoyed doing "Frankenstein" because I related to that naive monster wandering around a world he had no knowledge of — an outsider seeing everything through the eyes of a child." The following year, Ploog teamed with writer Steve Gerber on "Man-Thing" #5-11 (May-Nov. 1974), penciling a critically acclaimed series of stories involving a dead clown, psychic paralysis in the face of modern society, and other topics far removed from the usual fare of comics of the time, with Ploog's cute-but-creepy art style setting off Gerber's trademark intellectual surrealism.
Ploog's other regular titles at Marvel were "Planet of the Apes", "Kull the Destroyer" and the series "Werewolf by Night". Ploog also drew the Don McGregor story "The Reality Manipulators" in the black-and-white comics magazine "Marvel Preview" #8 (Fall 1976), and the Doug Moench feature "Weirdworld" in the color comic "Marvel Premiere" #38 (Oct. 1977), among other items.
He left Marvel following what he describes as "a disagreement with Jim Shooter. I had moved to a farm in Minnesota, and agreed to do a hand-colored 'Weirdworld' story. Marvel backed out of the deal after I had started. I can't remember the details, but it doesn't matter. I think I was ready to move on." Marvel and I were both changing. I finished off a black-and-white Kull book that was my last comic for many years." Richard Marschall, editor of what was to be a 60-page "Weirdworld" by Ploog and writer Moench for one of the "Marvel Super Special" series of one-shots, said at the time that Ploog had been given four months to complete the art, and when it became evident the deadline would not be met, arranged to publish the story in two 30-page installments, giving Ploog two more months. Ploog sent Marvel photocopies of the first 31 pages, and was paid for them. During this time, Marvel had given work-for-hire contracts to its freelancers, many of whom, including Ploog, Frank Brunner, Jack Kirby, Don McGregor, Roger Slifer, and Roger Stern, refused to sign, resulting in cessation of work for Marvel. Ploog "took himself off the project," said Marschall, and retained his original artwork. Moench's script was eventually published as a 106-page story illustrated by penciler John Buscema, inker Rudy Nebres, and airbrush colorist Peter Ledger as the three-part "Warriors of the Shadow Realm" in "Marvel Super Special" #11-13 (Spring - Fall 1979).
Marginalia includes some work for "Heavy Metal" magazine in 1981, and three "Luke Malone, Manhunter" backup features in the Atlas/Seaboard title "Police Action" #1-3 (Feb., April, June 1975), the first of which he also scripted.
Later career.
Ploog returned to the movie industry. By his account, he has worked in post-production on the movie "Ghostbusters" ("All that stuff you saw on cereal boxes are my paintings") and with film director Ralph Bakshi on the animated features "Wizards", "The Lord of the Rings", and "Hey Good Lookin'." He was production designer on "" (1988), and has storyboarded or done other design work on films including John Carpenter's "The Thing", "Superman II", "Little Shop of Horrors" and "The Unbearable Lightness of Being", and, he says, several Jim Henson Company projects, such as the films "Dark Crystal" and "Labyrinth" and the TV series "The Storyteller."
Between movies, Ploog illustrated "L. Frank Baum's the Life and Adventures of Santa Claus" (1992; ISBN 0-7567-6682-6), a graphic novel adapting "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" creator's 1902 novella.
With old colleague Steve Gerber, Ploog drew the Malibu Comics one-shot "Sludge: Red X-Mas" (Dec. 1994), but otherwise remained away from comics for another decade before teaming with veteran writer J.M. DeMatteis on the CrossGen fantasy "Abadazad" (May 2004).
Ploog has illustrated cards for the "" collectible card game.

EuroBasket 1946

The 1946 FIBA European Championship, commonly called FIBA EuroBasket 1946, was the fourth FIBA EuroBasket regional basketball championship, held by FIBA Europe and the first since 1939 due to World War II. Ten national teams affiliated with the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) took part in the competition. Switzerland hosted the tournament for a second time, as the championship returned to Geneva.
EuroBasket 1946 saw the beginning of the use of the jump shot, pioneered by Italy's Giuseppe Stefanini.
Results.
The 1946 competition consisted of a preliminary round, with one group of four teams and two groups of three teams each. Each team played the other teams in its group once. The top team in each of the groups of three and the top two teams in the group of four played in the semifinals for the top four rankings; the middle teams in the two groups of three moved directly on to the final round for a 5th/6th place playoff; the bottom team in each group of three and the two bottom teams in the group of four played in semifinals for the 7th–10th ranks.
Semifinal round.
The middle team of each of the groups of three did not compete in the semifinal round, as they advanced directly to a 5th/6th place playoff in the final round. The top team of each of those groups played one of the top two teams of the group of four, with rankings 1st–4th at stake. Similarly, the bottom team in each group of three played one of the two lower teams in the group of four in a semifinal for 7th–10th places.

Brennabor

Brennabor-Werke AG (previously Brennabor-Werke Gebr. Reichstein) was a German manufacturer of infant buggies, bicycles, motorcycles and, for two decades, of powered motor vehicles. It was based in Brandenburg an der Havel and operated between 1871 and 1945.
History.
By the 1930s the company had grown to become Europe’s largest produced of infant buggies and was also a leading bicycle producer.
Volume production of motor bikes began in 1901, and from 1903 the company was producing, at this stage only to special order, three- and four-wheeled powered vehicles. 1908 saw the beginning of series production of cars, and this was also the year that the company’s own racing team began to enjoy world-wide success in motor sport. However, car production was suspended in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War, while motor bike production was ended in 1916.
After the war, in 1919, the company presented the Brennabor Typ P, a car targeted at the upper middle classes, and volume production began in 1921. In 1924 Brennabor was employing approximately 6,000 people. During the mid-1920s Brennabor became Germany’s largest car producer, and it was still in second place, behind Opel, in 1927/28.
In 1919 the company formed an alliance with two other manufacturers, NAG and Hansa-Lloyd, the resulting tripartite grouping being known as GDA (Gemeinschaft Deutscher Automobilfabriken /Association of German Carmakers). The association lasted until 1928 but never progressed to the point of becoming a formal merger between the member companies.
In 1923/24 Brennabor led the way, as one of the first German auto-makers (along with Opel) to adopt US-style production line techniques. However, Brennabor had no small car model to compete with Opel’s Laubfrosch. The German economy was particularly badly hit by the world economic crisis of the 1920s, and the company saw demand and production volumes cut back at the end of the decade.
The company attempted a come-back in 1931, applying developments in front-wheel drive technology, using the Voran company’s patent, but this led only to a prototype based on the company’s six-cylinder Juwel 6 model. There was insufficient funding for any progression to volume production of any front-wheel-drive model. 1932 saw an eight-month hiatus in automobile production: production resumed at the end of the Autumn/Fall, but came to a permanent end in 1933.
The company continued as a producer of components and motor bikes until 1945, and also produced armaments during the Second World War, but it’s history came to an abrupt halt in 1945 when it found itself in the Soviet Occupation Zone and the plant was disassembled.
In the later 1940s the site would later be taken over and used for the creation of a Heavy tractor factory, in which form it continued till the 1960s. Since 1991 the former factory has housed a training centre owned by a subsidiary of the auto-engineering company, ZF Group.

Ai Tong School

Ai Tong School () is a primary school located in Bishan, Singapore. It is one of the five affiliated primary schools under the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan. As a Chinese-medium school, Ai Tong emphasizes strongly on the learning of Chinese culture, language and values. Ai Tong School is considered to be one of the most popular primary schools in Singapore, with places in the primary 1 intake frequently being oversubscribed.
The name Ai Tong (爱同) is derived from the Chinese values of "Bo Ai" (博爱) and "Da Tong" (大同) which means 'Love for all mankind' and 'Equality/Harmony' respectively. This name was given by Pastor Ong Kah Mok, one of the founders of this school.
Motto and logo.
Motto.
"Sincerity and Perseverance", meaning: "Be sincere with all people. Be persevering in all endeavours."
Logo.
The school logo resembles a flying wheel. The sign gives the school its name, Ai Tong School. The pair of wings symbolises the school soaring into greater heights, seeking higher aspirations and excellence. The circles symbolise the cohesive spirit of the teachers and pupils working together towards a common goal.
History.
Ai Tong School was first established in a Methodist Church at Boon Tat Street when it took over the running of a school by missionaries. Although it had an initial intake of 30 pupils, this soon increased to 120 pupils in 1960. In 1917, the school was moved into its own campus, located at 209, Telok Ayer Street, in order to cope with the larger enrollment.
However, soon after its move, Ai Tong School faced financial difficulties that almost forced the school to sell away its campus. It was rescued financially by Chinese businessman and philanthropist Tan Kah Kee, who provided financial assistance to the school. In 1923, the school faced another financial crisis, and Tan Kah Kee decided to provide funding for the school on a permanent basis. The Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan subsequently took over the responsibility for running the school in 1929,
After the Japanese occupation of Singapore ended, a branch school located on the old premises of Gan Eng Seng School was started. During this time, there were a huge backlog of students who wanted an education, since many students in Singapore dropped out of school during the occupation. As a result, the enrollment of the school increased to more than 1,600 students. This campus soon proved to be inadequate.
In 1950, Ai Tong School took in female students from the defunct Ai Hwa school and became a co-ed school; it had existed as a boy's school ever since its founding. In 1955, the main school moved to the new Hokkien Huay Kuan Building together with Chong Hock Girls School (the now Chongfu Primary School). This building had facilities like a science laboratory and a geography/history room, a rarity at that time. Two years later, the private school became a government-aided school. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the Bilingual policy by the Singapore Government, enrollment in Chinese-medium school like Ai Tong School drastically decreased. Initially, this caused the closure of smaller Chinese schools, and by taking in students from some of these school, Ai Tong's enrollment soon increased to 2360 students. However, after that, Ai Tong suffered the same problem and its enrollment soon fell below 800 students. The problem became worst when in 1979, only two students registered to join the school in 1980, though one later dropped out. More students were later transferred into the school because the neighbouring English-medium schools were at their full capacity.
Against this backdrop, the School's management decided to move the school to Ang Mo Kio to address the problem of declining enrollment. The construction work for a new school building began at Ang Mo Kio, Ave 3 in 1978. Classes at the new Ai Tong School campus started in 1980, and the school was officially declared open in 1981. The move from its old campus, in addition to the hard work of the Principal and staff of the school, helped the school to increase its enrollment from less than 100 before 1987 to 2357 in 1981. Following guidelines from the Ministry of Education, English language was taught as the first language and Chinese as the second language from 1984 onwards.
In 1990, Ai Tong became one of the first primary schools to be granted the status of a Special Assistance Plan school by the Ministry of Education. Schools under this plan have a special focus on teaching Chinese values, and they run special programmes related to the learning of Chinese culture and language.
On 9 July 1992, Ai Tong School moved to 100, Bright Hill Drive, located within Sin Ming estate, to cope with rising enrollment numbers. This campus was officially opened on 9 July 1993 by the then-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wong Kan Seng, who was also the Member of Parliament for Thomson GRC (of which Sin Ming is a part). An extension block to the school was later added in 1998 to increase the number of special rooms that the school had. The school undergone further refurbishment between November 2002 and 2004 under the Programme for Rebuilding and IMproving Existing schools.
On 31 December 2013, Ai Tong School moved to 4300 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, Singapore 569869 while renovation works at the previous campus starts. The new campus will be completed by 2015.
Academics.
Ai Tong School's curriculum has a strong Chinese influence, and also offers lessons on the Chinese culture and history. It is a designated SAP school, and thus it teaches both the English language and Chinese Language as a first language. Ai Tong has consistently produced top scorers at the national Primary School Leaving Examinations, and is widely regarded as a "top school" in Singapore.
Ai Tong has a winning programme with a school in Suzhou, China, and it conducts student exchanges between the two schools. In addition, students at the Primary 5 level also get the opportunity to attend cultural exchange programmes to other places in China.
Affiliations.
Ai Tong School is affiliated to the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan (SHHK) since 1929. It is the second oldest school amongst the five schools that are affiliated to the SHHK, the oldest being Tao Nan School. Other schools that are affiliated to the SHHK includes: Chongfu Primary School, Nan Chiau Primary School, Nan Chiau High School and Kong Hwa School. These schools share a common motto and mission, as well as having joint programmes like the Bi-Cultural Chinese Elective Programme (BiCEP).

Hood River (Nunavut)

The Hood River of Nunavut, Canada is a long river draining into the Arctic Ocean from its headwaters in the interior of Canada's tundra at Takijuq Lake, close to the Northwest Territories border. The river ends at Arctic Sound near the community of Bathurst Inlet. The river is above the Arctic Circle and tree line. 
Lake trout are plentiful and can be almost a metre long. The upper lakes of the Hood can be frozen until July, and on the banks of the river, grizzlies, wolves, wolverines, and muskox are plentiful. In the short Arctic summer, canoeists braving the mighty river can see the migration of the Barren-ground Caribou through the area. Muskox and wolves are also common sights. 
There are numerous rapids, waterfalls and glaciers along the river. Wilberforce Gorge is a steep, high gorge that runs for at almost deep. Wilberforce Falls, at the head of the gorge, is the highest waterfall north of the Arctic Circle falling in two drops. 
During Sir John Franklin's first overland expedition, the Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822, he came back up this river, after going down the Coppermine River, then east along the Arctic Coast to Point Turnagain, while searching for the Northwest Passage. The river gets its name from Midshipman Robert Hood, who was possibly murdered on the overland trek back to Fort Enterprise.

<doc id="2903202" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2903202" title="1969–70 NHL season">
1969–70 NHL season

The 1969–70 NHL season was the 53rd season of the National Hockey League. For the third straight season, the St. Louis Blues reached the Stanley Cup finals, and for the third straight year, the winners of the expansion Western Division were swept four games to none. This time, however, it was at the hands of the Boston Bruins, as the defending champions Montreal Canadiens narrowly missed the playoffs, something that would not happen again for the next quarter century. With the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens out, this meant that all participating teams in the 1970 playoffs were from the United States, the only time this has occurred in league history as of 2014. It was also the final season that teams wore their colored jerseys at home until the 2003–04 season.
Regular season.
Bobby Orr of the Boston Bruins became the first (and as of 2014, the only) defenseman in NHL history to win the league scoring championship. He did it by setting a new record for assists with 87 and totalling 120 points, only six shy of the point record set the previous season by teammate Phil Esposito. Along the way, he also won the Norris Trophy for the third straight year as the top defenseman, the Hart Trophy for league MVP, and the Conn Smythe Trophy for the playoff MVP, being the only player in the NHL to win four individual awards.
Gordie Howe finished the season within the ten leading NHL point scorers for an all time record of 21 consecutive seasons; it was the final season he would do so.
For the third straight season, the St. Louis Blues easily won the West Division, being the only team in the division to have a winning record.
The East Division, however, saw a temporary changing of the guard, as Montreal dropped from first the previous season to fifth, missing the playoffs on the "total goals scored" tie-breaker with the New York Rangers. The Rangers were in first place for a time, but injuries on the blueline doomed any hope of a first place finish, and they even obtained Tim Horton in desperation. It would be the only season Montreal failed to make the playoffs between 1948 and 1995, and as the Toronto Maple Leafs also failed to make the postseason, this set up the only playoffs in NHL history (as of 2009) to feature no Canadian teams. These developments were instrumental in the decision to move Chicago to the West Division in conjunction with the 1970 expansion, and the adoption of "crossover" playoff series between East and West Division teams the following season. The division crossover kept the newer expansion teams out of the Stanley Cup final for the next three seasons.
The Bruins and the Black Hawks both tied for the lead in the East with 99 points, but Chicago was awarded first place because they had more wins. It was Chicago's second first-place finish in Black Hawk history (the first being 1966–67)
Canadiens/Rangers tiebreaker.
Entering their last games of the regular season, the badly slumping New York Rangers were two points behind the Montreal Canadiens for the final playoff spot. A New York victory and a Montreal loss would have left them tied in points, and the first tiebreaker - number of wins - was also tied. The second tiebreaker was goals scored, and the Canadiens had a five-goal advantage in the "goals for" category. This led to unusual tactics from both teams. 
In their second-last game, the Detroit Red Wings had clinched a playoff spot, after having missed the postseason for the past three years. Many of their players were jubilant and were wildly celebrating this accomplishment, despite the fact that they were scheduled to face New York the next afternoon to finish the season. Several Detroit players still had hangovers from last night's party just hours before they took to the ice against the Rangers. The desperate Rangers managed 65 shots on Detroit goalie Roger Crozier to amass a 9-3 lead early in the third period. Looking for even more goals, Coach Emile Francis repeatedly pulled goalie Ed Giacomin for the extra attacker though this failed to add to the Rangers' tally; in fact this let the Red Wings hit the empty net twice for a 9-5 final score. Nonetheless, however, New York was now equal on points with Montreal and had four more goals for the season. 
That night, the Canadiens played against the notably stingy Chicago Black Hawks in what was both teams' final regular season game. Unlike the Red Wings, who had nothing else to accomplish in their final game, the Black Hawks were playing for first place in their division. With nearly nine minutes left in the third period and down 5-2 to the Hawks, the Canadiens knew scoring overcoming this 5-2 deficit in 9 minutes was highly unlikely, but they could still make the playoffs if they could score three more goals regardless of the game's outcome. So Coach Claude Ruel pulled his goaltender for the extra attacker. But the strategy backfired as Montreal failed to score while Chicago scored five times into the empty Montreal net, to win 10–2. This is believed to be the longest length of time any team had played without a goalie. The Canadiens, ending the season with two goals behind the Rangers, were out of the playoffs. Angry Habs fans have accused Detroit, having already secured a postseason berth and with nowhere to move in the standings, of purposely throwing the game to let the Rangers make the playoffs.
Playoffs.
Quarterfinals.
(E1) Chicago Black Hawks vs. (E3) Detroit Red Wings.
In the Chicago-Detroit series, the Black Hawks swept the series, interestingly winning all four games by 4–2 scores.
(E2) Boston Bruins vs. (E4) New York Rangers.
The Boston Bruins and New York Rangers were paired in the East Division playoffs. The Bruins clobbered the Rangers 8–2 in game one and Ranger coach Emile Francis yanked Ed Giacomin when the score reached 7–1. Terry Sawchuk took over in goal. Sawchuk replaced Giacomin in game two, but a new goalie was not the answer as Boston won 5–3. Game three featured a hostile welcome for the Bruins when they skated out on Madison Square Garden ice. The fans booed and shouted obscenities at the Bruins players, shook their fists at them and made obscene gestures at them. Two Bruins players made obscene gestures at the fans. Gerry Cheevers, the Bruins goaltender, was the target of eggs, coins and rubber balls. The Bruins won the opening face-off and Giacomin made the save on Phil Esposito. The line of Derek Sanderson, Don Marcotte and Ed Westfall replaced the Esposito line to the boos of the crowd. Just before the face-off, Giacomin skated to Sanderson and reportedly said "We're being paid to get you tonight." On the face-off, the puck went behind the Ranger net and Sanderson went after it. He was immediately smashed into the boards by Walt Tkaczuk and Arnie Brown. Then he collided with Dave Balon. Sanderson dropped his stick and gloves and went at Balon, which brought Brad Park and Bill Fairbairn into the fight. Don Marcotte joined in. Then the game erupted into a series of fights. The fans, turned on by the mayhem, threw eggs, apple cores, an aerosol shave cream container, oranges and other debris. When Sanderson was ejected from the game, he screamed at referee John Ashley. Police grappled with fans trying to attack the Bruins players at the Bruins players bench. The game erupted into more fights and brawls on the ice and fans threw eggs, nails, coins and other garbage. It took 19 minutes to play the first 91 seconds of the game. When the most violent, penalty-ridden game in playoff history this time was over, the teams had set a record 38 penalties for 174 minutes. Almost forgotten was that the Rangers won 4–3. Game four had Rod Gilbert score two goals in a 4–2 Ranger win. Giacomin was brilliant in goal for the Rangers and one of the highlights was stopping Derek Sanderson on a shorthanded breakaway. Game five was won by Boston 3–2 as Esposito scored two goals. Bobby Orr set up the winner when he stole a pass at center ice when the Rangers were foolishly caught on a line change. Game six was won easily by the Bruins and featured another disgraceful exhibition of fan abuse. Bobby Orr scored two goals, including the winner. Fans threw eggs, and ball bearings on the ice, and when the outcome was no longer in doubt, they set fires in the mezzanine of Madison Square Garden. Sadly, Terry Sawchuk died a few weeks after the playoffs ended. His career ended with 447 wins and 103 shutouts, records that would not be broken for the next 4 decades.
(W1) St. Louis Blues vs. (W3) Minnesota North Stars.
In the West Division playoffs, the St. Louis Blues ousted the Minnesota North Stars in six games. The Blues won the first two games at the St. Louis Arena. Game three at the Metropolitan Sports Center featured Gump Worsley's sharp goaltending and Bill Goldsworthy scoring two goals in a 4–2 win for the North Stars. Cesare Maniago played in goal for Minnesota in game four and picked up a 4–0 shutout, tying the series. Game five at St. Louis Arena was tied 3–3 when St Louis scored three goals in the third period by Red Berenson, Terry Gray and Jim Roberts and the Blues won 6–3. In game six, Ab McDonald scored two goals as the Blues eliminated the North Stars by a score of 4–2.
(W2) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (W4) Oakland Seals.
In the Pittsburgh-Oakland series, in game one, Nick Harbaruk's goal midway through the third period was the winner as Pittsburgh won 2–1. In game two, Gary Jarrett gave Oakland a 1–0 lead, but Pittsburgh came back to win 3–1. Game three at Oakland featured a hat trick by Ken Schinkel of the Penguins as Pittsburgh won 5–2. Game four featured Oakland having 1–0 and 2–1 leads, but the Seals just couldn't hold on and the game was tied 2–2 at the end of regulation time. Overtime was necessary and Michel Briere scored the series winning goal at 8:28 of overtime for Pittsburgh. It would be the last time the Seals would make the playoffs in their franchise history. The playoffs would not return to the California Bay area until the 1993–94 NHL season when the San Jose Sharks made the playoffs for "their" first time.
Semifinals.
(E1) Chicago Black Hawks vs. (E2) Boston Bruins.
In the East Division final, Boston beat Chicago in four straight games.
(W1) St. Louis Blues vs. (W2) Pittsburgh Penguins.
In the West Division final, the St. Louis Blues beat the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games. The Pens would not get to the semi-finals again for more than 20 years.
The Stanley Cup final would then be Boston vs. St. Louis.
Stanley Cup Finals.
Phil Esposito of the Bruins led all playoff scorers with 13 goals and 14 assists for 27 points, at the time a new NHL playoff record, followed by Orr with 20 points and Johnny Bucyk of the Bruins with 19 points. Gerry Cheevers of the Bruins led all goaltenders with twelve wins, while Jacques Plante of the Blues led all goaltenders in goals against average in the playoffs with 1.48.

Pierre Karl Péladeau

Pierre Karl Péladeau (born 16 October 1961) is the former president and CEO of Quebecor Inc., Quebecor Media Inc. and Sun Media Corporation. He is the Parti Québécois MNA-elect for Saint-Jérôme.
Biography.
Péladeau is the son of the Quebecor founder Pierre Péladeau, along with siblings Érik Péladeau, Anne-Marie Péladeau, Isabelle Péladeau, Simon-Pierre Péladeau, Esther Péladeau and Jean Péladeau.
He was educated in Montreal and Paris. He holds a degree in philosophy from Université du Québec à Montréal and a law degree from Université de Montréal. He was in a long-term relationship with Julie Snyder, which produced two children, Thomas and Romy, and ended in January 2014. He also has another child, Marie, who was born of his marriage with Isabelle Hervet, a native of France.
He joined his father’s management team at an early age.
He is known to be confrontational with unions and has used lock-out tactics at least 14 times. He counts Brian Mulroney amongst his business associates. Péladeau sits on the boards of several Quebecor companies and is active in many charitable and cultural organizations. Quebecers identify him with his initials, PKP.
Business career.
Péladeau first started in acquisition and business development participating in the acquisition of BCE Publitech which made Quebecor the largest printer in Canada. He played a leading role in the acquisition of Maxwell Graphics which gave the company a significant presence in the U.S. market. He also was involved in the acquisition of Donohue Inc., one of North America's most efficient pulp and paper companies.
Péladeau was appointed president of Quebecor Communications Inc. in 1991. This division included the company's main publishing assets and some distribution and retail operations.
In 1994, Péladeau relocated to Paris to help his company's growth. As president of Quebecor Printing Europe he developed the new subsidiary through a series of acquisitions in France, the United Kingdom and Spain, building it into Europe's largest printer.
In 1997, after the sudden death of his father, he returned to the Montreal head office to assume the position of executive vice president and chief operating officer of Quebecor Printing Inc. with overall responsibility for the company's worldwide operations.
In 1998, Péladeau spearheaded the acquisition of Sun Media Corporation, making Quebecor the second largest newspaper chain in Canada.
In 1999, he carried out the acquisition of World Color Press by Quebecor Printing Inc. The acquisition created Quebecor World Inc., one of the world's largest printers. Quebecor World had, at one time, operations in 17 countries on three continents and employs approximately 35,000 employees. In 1999 the board of directors of Quebecor Inc. named him president and CEO of the company.
In 2000, he was responsible for the acquisition of the Vidéotron group, the largest cable TV operator in Quebec, and TVA, the largest French-language broadcaster in the country. Shortly afterwards all of the company's media properties were brought under one roof with the creation of Quebecor Media, currently one of the largest media operations in Canada. It is engaged in newspaper publishing (Sun Media Corporation), cable television, Internet access provider and local telephony (Vidéotron ltée), broadcasting (TVA Group Inc.), Web technology and integration (Nurun Inc.), Internet portals (Canoe Inc.), book and magazine publishing (Publicor and TVA Publications Inc.), retailing of books and entertainment products (Archambault Group Inc. and Le SuperClub Vidéotron ltée) and business telecommunications (Vidéotron Télécom ltée).
In 2008, Quebecor World went bankrupt. He appeared to blame the Royal Bank of Canada and the English Canadian business establishment for his misfortune.
In March 2013, Péladeau announced he was stepping down as CEO of Vidéotron and was succeeded in May 2013 by then-President Robert Depatie. Péladeau was to continue to work for the company in corporate strategy.
On 15 May 2013, Péladeau was appointed by Pauline Marois to be chairman of the board of directors of Hydro-Québec, which is the largest hydroelectric producer and distributor in Canada. He resigned in March, 2014 to pursue his political ambitions.
Political career.
On 9 March 2014, Péladeau announced his candidacy for election as a star candidate for the Parti Québécois in the riding of Saint-Jérôme, which is contiguous with the Montreal exurb of the same name just north-east of Mirabel Airport. He was not previously known to be a sovereigntist, although with pronouncements such as the fact that he wants "Quebec to be a country" and that he is "in it for sovereignty" he promptly established himself as such.
The federal government chose in early March not to comment on Mr. Péladeau’s decision to embrace the PQ and Quebec sovereignty.
"We have no intention of getting involved in a provincial election," said Denis Lebel, federal Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, and since October 2008 the Minister of Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec in Stephen Harper's government.
Quebec Liberal leader and Leader of the Opposition Philippe Couillard felt the prospect of the man owning more than half of the media outlets in Quebec could become a government backbencher was a severe conflict of interest. His sentiments were echoed by the leader of the Coalition Avenir Quebec, François Legault. Comparisons between Peladeau and Silvio Berlusconi have been seen. Peladeau had in 2010 refused to meet with John Gomery, president of the "Conseil de presse du Quebec", over his withdrawal from the "Conseil" of two of Quebecor's newspapers, the "Journal de Montréal" and the "Journal de Québec". 
Péladeau's selection alienated voters on several fronts. He had a reputation for being a union-buster due to his frequent use of lockouts, a significant liability both in a province that is 40 percent unionized and in a party that has long billed itself as a social democratic party. At the same time, his unabashed support for sovereigntism alienated many voters who did not want to vote on the sovereignty issue again. Indeed, soon after he entered the race, the PQ's poll numbers flatlined and never recovered.
Péladeau was narrowly elected with 37 percent of the vote, even as the Liberals were elected to a strong majority government. His first day at the National Assembly was on Monday, May 26th, eight days after a bike accident in the Eastern Townships left him with eight fractures.

Vegas Stakes

Vegas Stakes (known in Japan as "Las Vegas Dream" for the Super Famicom) is a gambling video game developed by HAL Laboratory and originally released in 1993 for the Super Nintendo. It was also released for the Game Boy in 1995, and on the Virtual Console in Europe on August 31, 2007 and in North America on November 26, 2007. The Game Boy version is compatible with the Super Game Boy, and features borders which use artwork from the SNES version. It is the sequel to the NES game "Vegas Dream".
The game sees the player go to Las Vegas to gamble with $1000. Using that $1000, the player must try to win $10 million at different casinos. The game features the player gambling in Craps, Roulette, Blackjack, Poker, and Slots.
Overview.
The player can choose to play either a single-player or multi-player game. In the single-player game a computerized friend accompanies the player around the various casinos. In the multi-player game, poker cannot be played since everyone could see everyone else's cards. There are no random encounters in multi-player mode. The multi-player mode is not included in the Game Boy version.
At the beginning of the single-player game a car is seen driving to Las Vegas. The various "friends" of the player are introduced as Cliff, Maria, Isabelle and Raymond. All are eager to begin gambling. The "friends" are not present in the Game Boy version.
One of the biggest draws of "Vegas Stakes" is the situations the player must deal with aside from the gaming tables. Essentially, players will have interactions with their traveling party and casino patrons. Some are innocent; for example, one of your friends is going to the sports book and asks if you want to place a wager. However, some can have significant positive or negative consequences. Random patrons will approach you and depending on your choices, you may wind up making (or losing) a lot of money. These include:
There are several more random patron interaction situations in the Game Boy version, including the ability to wager on boxing matches or horse races.
Ending the Game.
The game ends when the player wins ten million dollars or loses all their money.
Winning more than $10 Million.
The screen says Congratulations, and (in the SNES version) whichever friend the player is with asks what the player will now do with his winnings. The player can then type in what they want to do with the money, and the friend confirms that it is an excellent idea. After the credits, the screen says "You will" followed by whatever you put in for your dream. In the Game Boy version, a man is in a car with his wife and talks about a new casino that he sees. The game will then scroll from the bottom to the top of the casino with (The Player's name)'s Casino.
Going bankrupt.
In the Japanese version, the letters in the words game over keep spinning in a clockwise formation. The North American version replaces this with a man in his jeans standing near the famous Las Vegas sign, pulling out his empty pockets.

The Mothman Prophecies (film)

The Mothman Prophecies is a 2002 psychological thriller film directed by Mark Pellington, based on the 1975 book of the same name by parapsychologist and Fortean author John Keel. The screenplay was written by Richard Hatem. The film stars Richard Gere as John Klein, a reporter who researches the legend of the Mothman. 
The film claims to be based on actual events that occurred between November 1966 and December 1967 in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Critical reviews were mixed, but the film was a modest financial success. 
Plot.
Newspaper columnist John Klein (Gere) and his wife Mary (Messing) are involved in a vehicular accident. Mary, the driver of the vehicle, swerves the automobile in order to avoid hitting something in the road. A brain scan shows evidence of a brain tumor and she subsequently passes away. Later, John discovers an assortment of mysterious drawings which she created before her death, depicting a strange black winged creature she saw on the night of the accident.
Two years later, while driving to Richmond, Virginia, Klein gets lost and inexplicably finds himself far away in the small town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Klein's car breaks down, as he makes his way to a nearby house on foot to contact help. The owner of the house, Gordon Smallwood (Patton), reacts violently to Klein's appearance and holds him at gun point. Local police officer Connie Mills (Linney) defuses the situation while Smallwood explains that this is the third night in a row that Klein has knocked on his door asking to use a phone, much to the confusion of Klein. Klein ends up staying at a local motel and tries to figure out how he ended up lost from his original destination. 
Officer Mills mentions to Klein that many strange things have been occurring in the past few weeks within Point Pleasant. While conversing with Smallwood one day, it is revealed to Klein that he had heard voices from his sink telling him that in Denver, 99 will die. Scared that Smallwood has the same ailment that contributed to his wife's death, Klein takes him to a doctor to get checked out. Smallwood is found to have a migraine, but no serious medical condition. While discussing the day's events at a local diner, Klein notices that the news is showing a story on an airplane crash in Denver that killed all 99 passengers aboard. The next night, Smallwood frantically explains that he had met the voices in his head. The being is named Indrid Cold. 
Later that night, Smallwood calls Klein and says that he is standing with Indrid Cold. While Klein keeps Cold on the line, Officer Mills goes out to check on Smallwood. Cold answers Klein's questions, convincing him that he is a supernatural being. This episode starts a string of supernatural calls to Klein's motel room. One of these phone calls tells Klein that there will be a great tragedy on the Ohio River. Later, Klein receives a call from Smallwood and rushes to check on him. He finds Smallwood dead from exposure to the elements. 
The entity described as the Mothman becomes a personal obsession for Klein. He meets an expert on the subject, Alexander Leek (Bates), who explains the nature of the supernatural being and details his own experience with it. As Klein reaches the bridge into town, there is traffic congestion originating from a malfunctioning traffic light. As Klein walks onto the bridge to investigate further, the bolts and supports of the bridge begin to strain at the weight. The bridge starts to come apart, making Klein realize that the tragedy that was prophesised to him was in fact the bridge. As the bridge collapses, Officer Mill's car falls into the water below. Klein jumps in after her and pulls her from the river and up to safety. As the two sit on the back of an ambulance, they see that they have just survived the collapse of the Silver Bridge. The epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that the cause of the bridge collapse was never fully determined. It also states that although the Mothman has been sighted in other parts of the world, it was never seen again in Point Pleasant.
Production.
Filming.
Aside from a few opening scenes filmed in Washington, D.C., most of motion picture was filmed in the areas of Pittsburgh and Kittanning in Pennsylvania. The scenes of Gere sitting on a park bench are on the University of Pittsburgh campus. Road montages were filmed on Pennsylvania Route 28, and the Chicago scenes are completely shot in downtown Pittsburgh’s Mellon Square and Trinity Churchyard environs as well as the entrance to the Duquesne Club. The "Chemical Plant" featured in the movie is actually a power station owned by Reliant Energy in Elrama, Pennsylvania. The Avalon Motor Inn is in Eighty Four, PA, south of Pittsburgh. Point Pleasant scenes were shot in Kittanning, Pennsylvania. The collapse of the Silver Bridge was actually filmed at the Kittanning Citizens Bridge in downtown Kittanning. Scenes shot at Gordon Smallwood’s house were filmed in Washington County on Pennsylvania Route 917. Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County Airport serves as backdrop for the airfield scenes. Despite this relocation, several police officers from Point Pleasant appeared as extras. In reality, 46 people died in the collapse of the Silver Bridge, not 36 as depicted in the film. The motion picture's claim at the end credits of the collapse of the Silver Bridge never being explained is false; the incident was found to be caused by the failure of an eye-bar in a suspension chain in 1971, well before the publication of the book on which the film is based, let alone the film.
Music.
The film's musical score was composed by the creative lab tomandandy. On January 22, 2002. Lakeshore Records released a 2-disc, edition of the soundtrack.
Release.
Home media.
Following its release in theaters, the Region 1 widescreen Pan and scan edition of the motion picture was released on DVD in the United States on June 4, 2002. Special features included, Director Mark Pellington's commentary; "Search for the Mothman" documentary; "Day by Day: A Director's Journey - The Road In" featurette; "Halflight" music video; 5 deleted scenes; and theatrical trailers. A Special Edition widescreen format of the film was released on May 27, 2003. Special features included, Digitally mastered audio & anamorphic video; Widescreen and full-screen presentations; Audio: English and French 5.1 (Dolby Digital); Subtitles: English, French, Spanish; DVD exclusive: "Half Light" music video directed by Mark Pellington; Theatrical trailer; Production notes; Interactive menus; and Scene selections. 
In supplemental fashion, a VHS format version of the film was released on October 1, 2002. An additional viewing option for the film in the media format of Video on demand has been made available as well.
Reception.
Critical response.
Among mainstream critics in the U.S., the film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 53% of 137 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 5.5 out of 10. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics' reviews, "The Mothman Prophecies" received a score of 52 based on 32 reviews. In 2003, the film won the "Best Sound Editing: Music in a Feature Film" award from the society of the Motion Picture Sound Editors.
Noted critic Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave it two stars out of four, calling it "unfocused" and "meandering," but praised the direction by Mark Pellington "whose command of camera, pacing and the overall effect is so good, it deserves a better screenplay."
Box office.
"The Mothman Prophecies" opened at the U.S. box office on January 25, 2002, earning $11,208,851 in its first weekend failing to enter the top five grossing films. It eventually went on to yield an estimated $35,746,370 in the U.S., and $19,411,169 in foreign markets for a worldwide total of $55,157,539.

Qijia culture

The Qijia culture (2400 BC - 1900 BC) was an early Bronze Age culture distributed around the upper Yellow River region of Gansu (centered in Lanzhou) and eastern Qinghai, China, it is regarded as one of the earliest bronze cultures. Johan Gunnar Andersson discovered the initial site at "Qijiaping" (齊家坪) in 1923. Qijia culture was a sedentary culture, based on agriculture, and breeding pigs, which were also used in sacrifices. Qijia culture is distinguished by a presence of numerous domesticated horses, and practice of oracle divination, the metal knives and axes recovered apparently point to some interactions with Siberian and Central Asian cultures, in particular with the Seima-Turbino complex. Archeological evidence points to plausible early contact between the Qijia culture and Central Asia. During the late stages of the culture, the Qijia culture retreated from the west and suffered a reduction in population size. Qijia culture produced some of the earliest bronze and copper mirrors found in China. Extensive domestication of horses are found at many Qijia sites.
The archaeological sites at Lajia, Huangniangniangtai, Qinweijia, and Dahezhuang are associated with the Qijia culture.

Acariasis

Acariasis is an infestation with mites.
Terminology.
There are several complications with the terminology:
Acariasis is a term for a rash, caused by mites, sometimes with a papillae (pruritic dermatitis), and usually accompanied by severe itching sensations.
The closely related term, mange, is commonly used with domestic animals (pets) and also livestock and wild mammals, whenever hair-loss is involved. "Sarcoptes" and "Demodex" species are involved in mange, but both of these genera are also involved in human skin diseases (by convention only, not called mange). "Sarcoptes" in humans is especially severe symptomatically, and causes the condition known as scabies.
Another genus of mite which causing itching but rarely causes hair loss because it burrows only at the kerratin level, is "Cheyletiella." Various species of this genus of mite also affect a wide variety of mammals, including humans.
Mite infestation sometimes implies an ectoparasitic, cutaneous condition such as dermatitis. However, it is possible for mites to invade the gasrointestinal and urinary tracts.
MeSH uses the term "Mite Infestations" as pertaining to Acariformes. However, mites not in this grouping can be associated with human disease. (See "Classification", below.)
The term Acari refers to ticks and mites together, which can cause ambiguity. (Mites are a paraphyletic grouping).
Mites can be associated with disease in at least three different ways: (1) cutaneous dermatitis, (2) production of allergin, and (3) as a vector for parasitic diseases. The language used to describe mite infestation often does not distinguish among these.
Classification.
Most of the mites which cause this affliction to humans are from the order Acari, hence the name Acariasis. The entire taxonomic classification to order would be:
Specific species involved include:
Some of these reflect reports existing of human infestation by mites previously believed not to prey on humans.
Diagnosis.
Medical doctors and dermatologists can still misdiagnose this rash as many are unfamiliar with parasitism, not trained in it, or if they do consider it, cannot see the mites.
Different methods for detection are recognized for different acariasis infections. Human acariasis with mites can occur in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, urinary tracts and other organs which not have been well-studied. For intestinal acariasis with symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and phohemefecia (is this hemafecia?), human acariasis is diagnosed by detection of mites in stools. For pulmonary acariasis, the presence of mites in sputum is determined by identifying the presence and number of mites in the sputum of patients with respiratory symptoms. Both physical and chemical methods for liquefaction of sputum have been developed.

Kyabram Fauna Park

The Kyabram Fauna Park is a fauna park in Kyabram, Victoria, Australia.
History.
Until 1967, the current site of the Kyabram Fauna Park was a fallow farmland that had been abandoned for some years. In 1967, the need to utilize this piece of land was voiced during Kyabram's public meetings. The land had sat unused for 80 years and there was a general consensus on the need to improve and use it. A portion of the land served as a run-off site for rainwater. This was all that the land was used for. It was during this time that the idea to use the land as a wildlife park emerged. The proposal was accepted and work began on building the Kyabram Fauna Park. 
Launched as a non-profit venture in 1976, the park is a sanctuary to over 400 species of animals who can all be viewed and many interacted with. The fauna park offers a walk through aviary and a heated reptile house containing snakes and fresh-water crocodiles. Other animals in the park include the parma wallaby, the alpine dingo, Tasmanian devils, wombats, echidnas, emus, koalas, wombats, kangaroos, and Cape Barren geese. 
The park is home to the cottage that French adventurer, navyman, and soldier Theodore Hazleman built in 1867. Hazleman, before settling in the area, sailed the seas as a cabin boy and survived the American Civil War. In Kyabram he set up as a wheat farmer and fathered 13 children.

History.
The casino first opened in 1978 as the Park Tahoe, built by Park Cattle Co. Caesars World took over the next year under a 25-year lease, with options to extend it another 50 years. Caesars agreed to spend $40 million to complete construction of the hotel portion of the property, which was renamed as Caesars Tahoe Palace, and later simply Caesars Tahoe. In line with the Caesars name, the property was remodeled with a Roman theme.
The hotel was known for its entertainment offerings, over the years playing host to Dean Martin, Cher, Mac Davis and Tony Bennett. In its later years, its showroom was graced by Rosie O'Donnell and many other headlining comics and big names. Celebrities like Michael Jordan, Randy Quaid, Kenny Rogers would play in the casino. Caesars was also the host hotel and title sponsor of the American Century Championship golf games at nearby Edgewood Golf course every July, until 2004. After Caesars sold the hotel in 2005, the title sponsorship and host switched to Harrah's/Harveys Casinos. Also, in its earlier years, Caesars Tahoe was home to title fights from championship names. 
Caesars Entertainment sold the resort in June 2005 for $45 million to Columbia Sussex, owner of the nearby Horizon Casino. It was one of a series of sales made by Caesars and Harrah's to avoid anti-trust issues with their proposed merger. Columbia Sussex rebranded the property as MontBleu Resort Casino & Spa in May 2006. After the bankruptcy of Columbia's gaming businesses, MontBleu became part of the reorganized Tropicana Entertainment Inc. in March 2010.
MontBleu stands as one of only three North American casinos to feature the Sigma Derby gambling game and is the only casino to feature more than one unit at a single location. 
MontBleu and the Horizon appeared as the Nomad Hotel in the 2007 film "Smokin' Aces".

Grana Padano

Grana Padano () is one of the most popular cheeses of Italy. The name comes from the noun "grana" (‘grain’), which refers to the distinctively grainy texture of the cheese, and the adjective "Padano", which refers to the valley Pianura Padana. It is called "Grana Padano" and not "Grana Padana" because the Italian word "grana" is the masculine noun, "il grana", describing this specific cheese, and not the feminine noun "la grana", which means "grain".
"Grana Padano" has protected designation of origin status since 1996.
History.
Grana Padano is one of the world's first hard cheeses, created nearly 900 years ago by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle Abbey, founded in 1135 near Milan, who used ripened cheese as a way of preserving surplus milk. By the year 1477, it was regarded as one of the most famous cheeses of Italy. It can last a long time without spoiling, sometimes aging up to two years. It is made in a similar way to the Parmigiano Reggiano of Emilia-Romagna but over a much wider area and with different regulations and controls. Other grana cheeses are also made in Lombardy, Piedmont, Trentino, and Veneto. 
Process of production.
Like Parmigiano Reggiano, Grana Padano is a semifat hard cheese which is cooked and ripened slowly (for at least 9 months, then, if it passes the quality tests, it will be fire-branded with the Grana Padano trademark). The cows are milked twice a day, the milk is left to stand, and then partially skimmed. Milk produced in the evening is skimmed to remove the surface layer of cream and mixed with fresh milk produced in the morning. The partly skimmed milk is transferred into copper kettles and coagulated; the resulting curd is cut to produce granules with the size of rice grains, which gives the cheese its characteristic texture, and then cooked to . It is produced year-round and the quality can vary seasonally as well as by year. Though similar to Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, the younger Grana Padano cheeses are less crumbly, milder and less complex in flavor than their more famous, longer-aged relative. 
Specifications.
A wheel of Grana Padano is cylindrical, with slightly convex or almost straight sides and flat faces. It measures in diameter, and in height. It weighs 24 to 40 kg (53 to 88 lbs) per wheel. The rind, which is thin, is white or straw yellow. 
Grana Padano is sold in three different ripening stages:
Grana padano cheese typically contains cheese crystals, semi-solid to gritty crystalline spots that at least partially consist of the amino acid tyrosine.

Anne-Marie Péladeau

Anne-Marie Péladeau (born 1964) is the daughter of Canadian businessman Pierre Péladeau, the founder of Quebecor, a diversified company with interests in printing and publishing and based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. 
In 1999, Anne-Marie sued brothers Pierre Karl and Erik over a $21 million inheritance she said had been denied her when their father died. Pierre Karl and Erik were running Quebecor, while Anne-Marie was largely estranged from them having suffered from substance abuse problems and living on an allowance of $100,000 per year. An out-of-court settlement was reached but her brothers then sued her lawyers, who then counter-sued. To date the case has not been settled. 
In October 2005, she was videotaped by Quebecor-owned news crews in a violent scuffle with Montreal police officers that resulted in her arrest and triggered questions by many, including Mayor Gérald Tremblay, about police brutality and the use of unnecessary force during her arrest. She faces 21 charges including theft and assaulting police, but has been released on bail to a detoxification centre near Montreal.
On August 9, 2007, Peladeau was arrested again at her home in the Montreal borough of Rosemont for cocaine and heroin trafficking. On August 14, 2007, she pleaded guilty to three counts of drug-trafficking.

History.
In December 2012, it was announced the Netherlands team would be dissolved for 2 years, because the national federation NBB wasn't willing to invest money in it. After a campaign by Dutch player who played in the Dutch Basketball League, the national team was eventually saved. Sports broadcaster Sport1 became main sponsor of the team, which started playing again.
During August 2013, the Netherlands was on its way to qualification for FIBA EuroBasket 2015, but lost two games 20–0 because the team played with two players – Mohamed Kherrazi and Sean Cunningham – who were identified as foreign players by the FIBA. The NBB believed that both were eligible players, and was upset that the attention came up after the Netherlands already won 2 games.

Beta Boötis

Beta Boötis (β Boo, β Boötis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of Boötes. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.5, making it one of the brighter members of the constellation. The traditional name Nakkar or Nekkar for this star is based upon the Arabic name for the constellation. This is a mis-transliteration of the Arabic بقّار "baqqār" "cattle driver", the Arabic letters "b" and "n" differing only in the placement of the dot. In the modern constellation, it marks the head of Boötis the herdsman. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is approximately from Earth. At that distance, the magnitude of the star is reduced by 0.06 from extinction caused by intervening gas and dust.
Nakkar has more than three times the mass of the Sun and greater than 21 times the Sun's radius. (König et al. (2006) give it 3.4 solar masses, while Tetzlaff et al. (2011) list a higher estimated mass of solar masses and Takeda et al. (2008) show it as 3.24 solar masses.) At the estimated age of , it has evolved into a giant star with a stellar classification of G8 IIIa. The star is radiating around 170–194 times as much luminosity as the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,932 K. This heat gives it the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star. It has an estimated rotation period of about 200 days and the pole is inclined to the line of sight from the Earth.
In 1993, the ROSAT satellite was used to observe an X-ray flare on Beta Boötis, which released an estimated . This was the first such observation for a low-activity star of this type. The flare may be explained by an as yet unobserved M-type dwarf companion star.

Gamma Boötis

Gamma Boötis (γ Boo, γ Boötis) is a star in the constellation Boötes. It has the traditional name Seginus (also "Segin", "Ceginus") of uncertain origin. It was listed as "Haris" in Bečvář. 
Properties.
Gamma Boötis is approximately 85 light years away from Earth. It belongs to the spectral class A7III. It is a Delta Scuti type variable star with a period of 1.13 hours. Its brightness varies from magnitude +3.02 to +3.07.
Etymology.
In Chinese astronomy, Seginus is called 招搖, Pinyin: Zhāoyáo, meaning "Twinkling Indicator", because this star is marking itself and stand alone in "Twinkling Indicator" asterism, Root mansion (see : Chinese constellation). 招搖 (Zhāoyáo), westernized into Chaou Yaou, but the name "Chaou Yaou" was designated for β Boötis (Nekkar) by R.H. Allen and the meaning is "to beckon, excite, or move." 
In the catalogue of stars in the "Calendarium" of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Menkib al Aoua al Aisr (منكب العواء الأيسر - "mankibu lʿawwaaʾi lʾaysar"), which was translated into Latin as Humerus Sinister Latratoris, meaning "the left shoulder of barker".
The name Seginus resulted from Latinization of an Arabic form of the Greek name of the constellation of Boötes (Theguius). The name Haris comes from the Arabic name of the constellation of Boötes, Al Haris Al Sama, which means "the guard".
Namesakes.
USS Seginus (AK-133) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.

Paper negative

The paper negative process consists of using a negative printed on paper (either photographically or digitally) to create the final print of a photograph, as opposed to using a modern negative on a film base of cellulose acetate. The plastic acetate negative (which is what modern films produce) enables the printing of a very sharp image intended to be as close a representation of the actual subject as is possible. By using a negative based on paper instead, there is the possibility of creating a more ethereal image, simply by using a paper with a very visible grain, or by drawing on the paper, or distressing it in some way. 
One of the original forms of photography was based on the paper negative process. Talbot's waxed-paper negative process, which was used to create his work "The Pencil of Nature", used a negative created on paper treated with silver salts, which was exposed in a camera obscura to create the negative and then contact printed on a similar paper to produce a positive image. 
When Talbot created this process it was intended to be a way to reproduce nature as accurately as possible (hence the name of his work, "The Pencil of Nature"). Through the years afterward, however, better and more accurate ways of producing exact replicas of nature were developed, and these processes relegated the paper negative process to obsolescence. 
The process of the paper negative is still relevant, though, in the realm of alternative-process photography. Photographers employing alternative processes reject the idea of the exact replica of nature and seek to use the inherent inexactness of antiquated processes to create a more personal and emotional image. The paper negative is an extremely versatile process that allows all manner of reworking and retouching of an image, and is the perfect medium to bridge the gap between camera operator and artist.

California Coast University

California Coast University (CCU) is a for profit, private university, based in Santa Ana, California. They are accredited by the Distance Education and Training Council. Degree Programs are offered through CCU's distance education curriculum, through both online and correspondence studies, and traditional classroom attendance is not offered. Approximately 8,000 students are enrolled at any given time.
History.
California Coast University was founded in 1973 as California Western University, with administration and library facilities located in downtown Santa Ana, California. The name was changed to California Coast University in 1981. In 2010, CCU moved to larger headquarters to accommodate its continued growth.
Academics.
CCU offers undergraduate and graduate programs in business administration, management, marketing, psychology, criminal justice, human resource management, healthcare management, and education.
Accreditation.
CCU received national accreditation from the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC) on January 8, 2005. The DETC is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) in Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Department of Education (USDE). As of January 2010, DETC accreditation authorizes CCU to award degrees up to and including the doctoral level. Since DETC has been approved by USDE to accredit professional doctorates, including the D.B.A. and Ed.D, CCU has been granted approval to offer several Ed.D doctorate programs. CCU has been approved by the State of California since 1974. Such approval is currently granted by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education a branch of the California Department of Consumer Affairs.
Before accreditation in 2005, unaccredited CCU was investigated by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) as part of a study of subsidies given to federal employees for coursework and degrees from unaccredited schools and diploma mills. The GAO found no wrongdoing and CCU completed their accreditation soon thereafter. CCU graduates with a degree earned during the school's previously unaccredited status have occasionally run into difficulty when trying to use their unaccredited degrees.

Eta Boötis

Eta Boötis (η Boo, η Boötis) is a star in the constellation Boötes. It has the traditional names Muphrid and Saak, and the Flamsteed designation 8 Boötis. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.
The name Muphrid is from the Arabic مفرد الرامح "mufrid ar-rāmiħ" "the (single) one of the lancer". In Chinese, (), meaning "the Right Conductor", refers to an asterism consisting of Eta Boötis, Tau Boötis and Upsilon Boötis. Consequently, Eta Boötis itself is known as (, .) In the catalogue of stars in the "Calendarium" of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Ramih al Ramih (رمح الرامح - "rumḥ al rāmiḥ"), which was translated into Latin as Lancea Lanceator, possibly meaning "the lance of the lancer".
This star is a subgiant that has begun the process of evolving from a main sequence star into a red giant. It has about 1.7 times the mass of the Sun and 2.7 times the Sun's radius. The estimated age of this star is about 2.7 billion years. Based on its spectra, Eta Boötis has a significant excess of elements heavier than helium. In fact the ratio of iron to hydrogen is considered close to the upper limit for dwarf stars in the galactic disk. The star is a suspected spectroscopic binary with a reported period of 494 days, but the companion was not confirmed through speckle interferometry. This measurement does not rule out a low mass stellar companion of spectral class M7.
Eta Boötis appears close to the prominent star Arcturus (Alpha Bootis) in Earth's sky, and Arcturus is in fact its closest stellar neighbor, as both stars are nearly identical in distance from the Sun. The two stars are about 3.24 light years apart [http://www.stellar-database.com/Scripts/find_neighbors.exe?ID=96000&ly=15], and each would appear bright in the other's sky. Arcturus would appear as roughly magnitude -5.2 (about 120 times brighter than it appears from Earth, or close to twice the brightness of Venus) in the night sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Eta Boötis, while Eta Boötis would appear at about magnitude -2.5 in the sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Arcturus, or over twice the brightness of Sirius in our night sky.

Theta Boötis (θ Boo, θ Boötis) is a star in the constellation Boötes. It has the traditional name Asellus Primus (Latin for "first donkey colt") and the Flamsteed designation 23 Boötis.
This star, along with the other "Aselli" (ι Boo and κ Boo) and λ Boo, were Al Aulād al Dhiʼbah (ألعولد ألذعب - "al aulād al dhiʼb"), "the Whelps of the Hyenas". 
In Chinese, (), meaning "Celestial Spear", refers to an asterism consisting of θ Boötis, κ2 Boötis and ι Boötis. Consequently, θ Boötis itself is known as (, .)
Properties.
Theta Boötis has apparent magnitude +4.04 and belongs to the spectral class F7V. It is approximately 47 light years from Earth. From about 4300 BC until 3942 BC, it was the closest star to the celestial north pole visible to the naked eye, although it was still too far away and too dim to be regarded as a pole star.
There is a nearby 11th magnitude optical companion star about 70 arcseconds away. This is a class M2.5 dwarf that is separated by approximately 1,000 AUs. It is uncertain whether they are gravitationally bound, but they do have a common motion through space and so the two stars probably share a common origin.

Billy G. Mills

Billy G. Mills (born 1929) is a retired Los Angeles Superior Court judge and a former Los Angeles City Council member, serving from 1963 to 1974. He was one of the first three African-Americans elected to the council.
Biography.
Mills was born on November 19, 1929, in Waco, Texas, the son of Roosevelt Mills of Marshall, Texas, and Jenye Vive Mills, also of Texas. He went to A.J. Moore High School in Waco, where he was captain and quarterback of the football team. A member of the debate and declamation squad, he was named "Most Outstanding Student" in 1947. He moved to California after graduation and then received an associate in arts degree from Compton College and a Bachelor of Arts degree from UCLA in 1951. While an undergraduate, he joined the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity. He earned a law degree from UCLA in 1954, spent a year working at Douglas Aircraft and then was in the Army until 1957; he was assigned to legal duties in Japan. After his discharge, he became a deputy county probation officer, and in 1960 began to practice law. He ran unsuccessfully for a municipal judgeship in 1962.
He was married on June 20, 1953, to Rubye Maurine Jackson of Texarkana, Texas. They had twin daughters, Karen and Karol, and three sons, Wiliam Karl, John Stewart and James Edward. In 1966 they were living at 3621 Third Avenue in the Jefferson Park district.
City Council.
Elections.
"See also List of Los Angeles municipal elections, 1963 and after."
Mills was elected to Los Angeles City Council District 8 in 1963, succeeding Gordon Hahn. After the election, he noted that the "cheek has turned and now Caucasians will realize that you don't have to be white to represent whites."
He and Tom Bradley were the next two blacks to serve on the Los Angeles City Council, after Gilbert Lindsay, who had been appointed in the 9th District in 1962. Lindsay was elected in his own right in 1964, so the three were the first blacks to be elected to the City Council. All three were reelected in 1967 and 1971.
In 1968 Mills ran unsuccessfully for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, challenging the incumbent, Kenneth Hahn.
Watts riots.
Meeting.
On Wednesday evening, August 11, 1965, a large-scale civil disturbance broke out in the Watts district of Los Angeles and spread within a few days to other parts of the city. Thirty -four people were killed, 1,032 injured, and 3,438 arrested. It was the most severe riot in the city's history to that time. Mills called a meeting of community and "indigenous" leaders in the City Council chambers on Saturday morning "to hear comments from anyone connected with the disturbances so city officials can begin getting at the causes of the riots." Staff writer Paul Beck of the "Los Angeles Times," reported:
Mills' decision to hold the meeting came in the face of warnings from other councilmen that it could cause serious problems and do no good in calming those involved. . . . "I can imagine the drapes being torn down and the furniture slashed," said Councilman John C. Holland."
Police probe.
Mills demanded an investigation of the role of the Los Angeles Police Department in the riots and asked Mayor Yorty to issue an executive order that would prevent Chief William H. Parker and other department heads from making public statements without clearing them first with the mayor or appropriate governing boards. He said the Los Angeles police were "rendered totally inept" after the rioting had started.
On September 8, 1965, Mills "directed" Chief Parker to appear before him "in person" to explain a raid on a Black Muslim mosque the preceding August 18, in which nineteen people were arrested and all were freed by a judge, citing lack of evidence. Parker declined to comply. Mills' action, according to a news report, was "in keeping with his persistent opposition to the chief." Mills was the only council member who did not vote in favor of a council resolution commending Parker and the department for their work during the disturbances. He said he would have voted in favor if the resolution had it not named Parker and had it not "excused" the police for all their actions.
The councilman said he had information that the mosque raid was "deliberately provoked" by false phone calls that Negroes were carrying guns into the building. He was critical of heavy police gunfire and claimed that the officers "were trying to destroy" two buildings on the property. Deputy Police Chief Thomas Reddin responded that "large-scale force was necessary to overcome large-scale resistance." Mills later submitted a report suggesting that a fire set inside the mosque could have been done by police as an act of "hostility."
Inquests.
Mills was critical of the coroner's inquests that were held after the riots. He said they were "attempts to justify the shooting of elderly citizens, unarmed youths and innocent bystanders." Twenty-six of the riot deaths were ruled justifiable homicide, one was accidental and five were criminal.
Democratic Party.
By a three-vote margin, Mills in 1966 was elected the first black chairman of the Democratic County Central Committee over fellow Councilman Tom Bradley, also an African American. After the vote, Mills called for the defeat of former movie star and television actor Ronald Reagan, who was running for governor as a Republican.
Superior Court.
On April 3, 1974, Governor Reagan appointed Mills to the Superior Court bench, effective immediately. Mills said he had never supported Reagan politically but had been "on friendly terms with him for years" and that Reagan had appointed him to the California Council on Criminal Justice in 1972. Mills did support President Richard M. Nixon during the 1972 campaign. Mills had been suggested for the Superior Court position by the black caucus in the California Legislature.

Luxembourg national basketball team

The Luxembourgian national basketball team is the basketball team that represents Luxembourg in international competitions.
Eurobasket 1946.
Luxembourg's first European championship appearance was at the Eurobasket 1946. They found themselves heavily overmatched in the preliminary round, being outscored by 113 points over three games. They ranked last place in the group of four. The semifinal round, which was essentially a 7th–10th place classification round for Luxembourg, saw their first win. They defeated England 50–27. This advanced them to a playoff for 7th and 8th places; they were defeated by Belgium to finish 8th out of the ten team competition.
Eurobasket 1951.
Luxembourg competed at the Eurobasket 1951 competition in Paris. They lost all four of their preliminary round games, putting them fifth place in their group of 5. Since they were seeded into a group of five teams rather than a group of four teams (the 18 teams were divided into 4 groups, 2 groups with 5 teams and 2 groups with 4 teams), Luxembourg had to play an elimination game against Denmark for the right to advance into the classification rounds. The winner could potentially place as high as 9th; the loser was relegated to 17th place.
Luxembourg was able to get a final half-court shot off before time expired, but the ball bounced off the rim and the team was served their fifth and final loss of the tournament.
Eurobasket 1955.
The Eurobasket 1955 in Budapest was where Luxembourg next appeared. They lost all four preliminary round games, and were relegated to the classification rounds. In the first round, Luxembourg was able to win 2 games, finishing third in the group. They lost their 13–16 semifinal, but won the 15/16 final to finish 15th out of 18 teams.

Ratcatcher (comics)

The Ratcatcher (Otis Flannegan) is a fictional character, a supervillain in the DC Comics universe, primarily as an enemy of Batman. First appearing in "Detective Comics" #585 (April 1988), the Ratcatcher was created by Alan Grant, John Wagner and Norm Breyfogle.
Fictional character biography.
At one time an actual rat catcher in Gotham City, Otis Flannegan sank into a life of crime. He's been imprisoned numerous times in his career (he is a regular in Blackgate Penitentiary) for assault, kidnapping, and robbery. Flannegan calls himself The Ratcatcher because of his special talent: the ability to communicate with and train rats. The Ratcatcher has used his minions to plague Gotham on more than one occasion by unleashing hordes of the vermin. In prison, Flannegan is able to smuggle items in and out with the help of his small friends.
Flannegan isn't the most devious or most powerful of Batman's rogues gallery, nor is he insane. His supervillain outfit is a gas mask and vermin control gear. Flannegan is often drawn with rat-like features.
When "Infinite Crisis" began, the Ratcatcher was being protected by, in addition to his rat friends, the homeless community. When he was discovered and being taken away, one of the homeless attempted to aid Flannegan, but was easily knocked aside by the arresting officers. The man turned out to be an OMAC in hiding, and the injury apparently initiated its release. The OMAC identified the Ratcatcher as a gamma level threat and vaporized him.
Powers and Abilities.
The Ratcatcher has the ability to control an army of rats. He also wields a gas gun and can manipulate various things with cyanide gas.

Private equity fund

A private equity fund is a collective investment scheme used for making investments in various equity (and to a lesser extent debt) securities according to one of the investment strategies associated with private equity. 
Private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of 10 years (often with annual extensions). At inception, institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership, which is then drawn over the term of the fund. From investors point of view funds can be traditional where all the investors invest with equal terms or asymmetric where different investors have different terms.
A private equity fund is raised and managed by investment professionals of a specific private equity firm (the general partner and investment advisor). Typically, a single private equity firm will manage a series of distinct private equity funds and will attempt to raise a new fund every 3 to 5 years as the previous fund is fully invested.
Legal structure and terms.
Most private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are governed by the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement or LPA. Such funds have a general partner (GP), which raises capital from cash-rich institutional investors, such as pension plans, universities, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and high net worth individuals, which invest as limited partners (LPs) in the fund. Among the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement are the following:
Private equity investments and financing.
A private equity fund typically makes investments in companies (known as portfolio companies). These portfolio company investments are funded with the capital raised from LPs, and may be partially or substantially financed by debt. Some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym LBO for "leveraged buy-out". The cash flow from the portfolio company usually provides the source for the repayment of such debt. 
Such LBO financing most often comes from commercial banks, although other financial institutions, such as hedge funds and mezzanine funds, may also provide financing. Since mid-2007, debt financing has become much more difficult to obtain for private equity funds than in previous years.
LBO funds commonly acquire most of the equity interests or assets of the portfolio company through a newly created special purpose acquisition subsidiary controlled by the fund, and sometimes as a consortium of several like-minded funds.
Private equity multiples and prices.
The acquisition price of a portfolio company is usually based on a multiple of the company's historical income, most often based on the measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio company's industry, the size of the company, and the availability of LBO financing.
Portfolio company sales (or "exits").
A private equity fund's ultimate goal is to sell or "exit" its investments in portfolio companies for a return, known as internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of the price paid. These exit scenarios historically have been an IPO of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition (M&A), also known as a trade sale. A sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm, also known as a "secondary sale", has become increasingly more common. In prior years, another exit strategy has been a preferred dividend by the portfolio company to the private equity fund to repay the capital investment, sometimes financed with additional debt.
Private equity funds and private equity firms: an illustration.
The following is an illustration of the difference between a private equity fund and a private equity firm:
Investment features and considerations.
Considerations for investing in private equity funds relative to other forms of investment include: 
For the above mentioned reasons, private equity fund investment is for investors who can afford to have capital locked up for long periods and who can risk losing significant amounts of money. These disadvantages are offset by the potential benefits of annual returns, which may range up to 30% for successful funds.

Galatea 2.2

Galatea 2.2 is a 1995 pseudo-autobiographical novel by Richard Powers and a contemporary reworking of the Pygmalion myth. The book's narrator shares the same name as Powers, with the book referencing events and books in the author's life while mentioning other events that may or may not be based upon Powers' life. Powers has stated that his wife and sons provided inspiration for the book's writing.
Plot summary.
The main narrative tells the story of Powers' return to his "alma mater" – referred to in the novel as simply "U.", but clearly based on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the school Powers attended and teaches at as a professor – after he has ended a long and torrid relationship with a loving but volatile woman, referred to as "C." Powers is an in-house author for the university, and lives for free for one year. He finds himself unable to write any more books, and spends the first portion of the novel attempting to write, but never getting past the first line.
Powers then meets a computer scientist named Philip Lentz. Intrigued by Lentz's overbearing personality and unorthodox theories, Powers eventually agrees to participate in an experiment involving artificial intelligence. Lentz bets his fellow scientists that he can build a computer that can produce an analysis of a literary text that is indistinguishable from one produced by a human. It is Powers' task to "teach" the machine. After going through several unsuccessful versions, Powers and Lentz produce a computer model (dubbed "Helen") that is able to communicate like a human. It is not clear to the reader or to Powers whether she is simulating human thought, or whether she is actually experiencing it. Powers tutors the computer, first by reading it canonical works of literature, then current events, and eventually telling it the story of his own life, in the process developing a complicated relationship with the machine.
The novel also consists of extensive flashbacks to Powers' relationship with C., from their first meeting at U., to their bohemian life in Boston, to their move to C.'s family's town in the Netherlands.
The novel culminates with Helen being unable to bear the realities of the world, and "leaving" Powers. She asks Powers to "see everything" for her, and subsequently shuts herself down. Her exit from the world forces Powers to experience a rebirth. In addition, Powers realizes that "he" was Lentz's experiment: would he or wouldn't he be able to teach a computer? Through the transformation he experiences, he is suddenly able to interact with the world, and he can write again.
Reviews and critiques.
Reception for the book has been mostly positive, with the Los Angeles Times praising the novel. The New York Times wrote that "Galatea 2.2" was "complex" and a "heady and provocative experiment". The Washington Times expressed that the book "may not be the easiest to access, but will prove as enchanting as any."

<doc id="2903354" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2903354" title="Gao Qiu">
Gao Qiu

Gao Qiu (died 1126) was a government official who served Emperor Huizong during the Song Dynasty. He is also featured as one of the main antagonists and nemesis of the 108 Liangshan outlaws in the "Water Margin", one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.
Biography.
According to the Chinese historical text "Huizhulu" (揮麈錄) by Song Dynasty scholar Wang Mingqing, Gao Qiu was the son of Gao Dunfu (高敦復) and was from Kaifeng. He had two brothers and four sons.
Gao Qiu used to be a servant of poet and statesman Su Shi before moving on to serve the artist Wang Shen. During the reign of Emperor Huizong of Song, Gao Qiu participated in battles under Liu Zhongwu's command and followed Lin Shu on a diplomatic mission to the rival Liao Dynasty. As he was favoured by Emperor Huizong, Gao Qiu's position in politics and the military rose until he became a Grand Marshal (太尉).
After the death of Emperor Huizong, Gao Qiu's influence in the imperial court decreased and he died of illness in 1126.
In fiction.
Early life and rise to prominence.
Gao Qiu is first introduced in the novel as a street rascal. He specialises in playing qiqiu (氣毬; ancient Chinese football) and by coincidence, he meets Prince Duan, the younger brother of the reigning Emperor Zhezong. Prince Duan is also interested in qiqiu and he is deeply impressed by Gao Qiu's talent that he invites Gao to serve him in his residence and play qiqiu with him.
After the death of Emperor Zhezong, Prince Duan ascends to the throne as Emperor Huizong and Gao Qiu is promoted to high official ranks by the emperor. Gao Qiu eventually becomes a Grand Marshal, who wields great power and commands the military. However, the imperial court becomes increasingly corrupt with the presence of Gao Qiu, who uses his influence to promote nepotism and bring his supporters into the government.
Lin Chong's story.
Gao Qiu's villainy is exhibited in the story of Lin Chong, one of the 108 Liangshan outlaws and protagonists of the story. Gao Qiu's foster son, Gao Yanei, is attracted to Lin Chong's wife and attempts to seize her for himself, but his plans were foiled by Lin Chong. Gao Yanei collaborates with his foster father to frame Lin Chong for attempting to assassinate a government official. Lin is convicted and sentenced to face-tattooing and exile to Cangzhou. Gao Qiu bribes the guards escorting Lin Chong into exile to kill Lin along the way, but fails when Lin's sworn brother Lu Zhishen saves him. Gao Qiu sends Lu Qian to Cangzhou later to bribe the prison officials there to kill Lin Chong, but Lin survives and becomes an outlaw at Liangshan Marsh. Lin Chong swears vengeance on Gao Qiu and vows to avenge his wife, who has committed suicide to prevent herself from being humiliated by Gao Yanei.
Rivalry with Liangshan.
As the story progresses, more outlaws gather at Liangshan Marsh, with most of them forced to become outlaws due to corruption in the government. The outlaws pledge to "deliver justice on Heaven's behalf" and rid their country of evil and corruption. Gao Qiu's cousin Gao Lian, governor of Gaotangzhou (present-day Gaotang County, Liaocheng, Shandong), is an equally corrupt official like him. Gao Lian is killed by the outlaws after they attack Gaotangzhou to rescue Chai Jin, who had been wrongfully imprisoned by Gao Lian. Gao Qiu vows to avenge his cousin and he sees the Liangshan outlaws as a threat. Along with the Imperial Tutor Cai Jing and general Tong Guan, Gao Qiu constantly urges Emperor Huizong to send the imperial army to attack the outlaws.
The emperor sends the army to attack Liangshan five times, but the outlaws emerge victorious eventually each time, with some of the commanders, such as Huyan Zhuo and Guan Sheng, defecting over to join the outlaws. Gao Qiu takes command of the army during the fifth military campaign and he is captured by the outlaws after his defeat. Lin Chong and some of the outlaws want to kill Gao Qiu for revenge, but Song Jiang stops them, because he intends to use Gao to help the outlaws attain amnesty from the government.
Eventual fate of the Liangshan heroes.
Gao Qiu is released by the outlaws after he promises to help them persuade Emperor Huizong to grant them amnesty, but goes back on his word. Eventually, the outlaws are granted amnesty by the emperor with help from other good officials. Emperor Huizong allows the Liangshan heroes to embark on military campaigns against the enemies of the Song Dynasty, including the Liao Dynasty and the rebel forces of Fang La, Tian Hu and Wang Qing. By the time the campaigns ended, nearly two thirds of the 108 Liangshan heroes have been killed in action.
A majority of the surviving heroes were granted official posts by Emperor Huizong in recognition of their contributions to the nation. However, Gao Qiu and the antagonists are dissatisfied with the heroes' fates and they conspire to eliminate Song Jiang and some of the other heroes. The story ends with the tragic dissolution of the heroes, who have dedicated themselves to their cause of "delivering justice on Heaven's behalf".

England men's national basketball team

The England national basketball team represents England in international basketball competitions. The team is organised by England Basketball, the sport's governing body in England. In 2005 England, along with the basketballscotland and their counterparts in Wales combined forces to form the Great Britain national basketball team, with the target goal to field a competitive team capable of winning medals at the London 2012 summer Olympics. England's direct affiliation to FIBA will end on 30 September 2016.
The team's main success was the bronze medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games.
History.
Eurobasket 1946.
England's first European championship appearance was at Eurobasket 1946. They lost all four of the games that they played, and subsequently finished last in the field of ten teams.
Eurobasket 1955.
A few years later, England qualified for the Eurobasket 1955 in Budapest, where the English Team had a couple of strong showings. After losing their preliminary round games they beat Switzerland, a major player at the global stage until the mid-50s. The victory marked England's first victory at a major international basketball event. Later, England outscored Austria as well. Eventually, the team placed second in the five teams of the classification group, moving to the 9–12 classification semifinals. There, however, England could not take advantage of the gained self-confidence and lost the next two games. Overall, England finished in 12th place out of the 18 teams, a considerable improvement from its last eurobasket appearance in 1946.
Eurobasket 1961 and 1981.
Despite the improvements in the preceding years, Team England did not do well at the Eurobasket 1961 or the Eurobasket 1981 and lost most games. Its lone victory, however, came in 1981 when they beat the elite team of Greece. This victory still stands as one of the major surprises in the history of the tournament.
Commonwealth Games.
Melbourne 2006.
The men's and women's teams were competing for the first time as England in a major multi-sport event, and it was the first Commonwealth Games in which basketball was featured.
The men's team included Steve Bucknall, the second Englishman to play in the NBA. John Amaechi, who played 284 games in the NBA, came out of retirement to participate in Melbourne. Having lost to Australia in the semi-finals, they faced Nigeria in the Bronze medal match. The teams were tied at 15 points to end the first quarter. Robert Reed and Andrew Bridge led the way as England found their stride in the second phase, and they pulled away in the second half of play. Reed played like a snake possessed and was the top scorer for England with 16 points and dominating the Nigerians who had no answer to his all action style. Michael Martin also contributed with 13 points. England won the game 80–57 to claim the first Bronze medal in Commonwealth Games basketball

River Palms

The River Palms Resort & Casino, located in Laughlin, Nevada, United States, is owned and operated by Tropicana Entertainment. The property includes a casino and more than 1,000 hotel rooms in a 25-story tower. The resort has approximately 1,100 slot machines, a poker room, and a bingo club.
History.
The resort was created by Las Vegas real estate developer John Midby. It opened in 1984 as Sam's Town Gold River, later shortened to Gold River. It was operated by Boyd Gaming until their contract was ended in 1991.
A 25-story, 778-room hotel tower was opened in 1990.
Gold River filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1996. Businessman Allen Paulson took ownership of the reorganized company a year later, having paid an estimated $28 million for the property's $90 million in debt. It was renamed as the River Palms Resort Casino the following year. The hotel underwent a major renovation in 1999.
Paulson died in 2000, and Columbia Sussex bought the property from his estate in 2004. After Columbia's gaming businesses went into bankruptcy, Tropicana Entertainment Inc. emerged in 2010 with most of the company's casinos, including the River Palms.
In May 2013, Tropicana agreed to sell the River Palms for $7 million to M1 Gaming, owner of Boomtown Casino & Hotel Reno, but the sale was "on hold" as of March 2014. In July 2014, Tropicana agreed to sell the River Palms for $6.75 million to the owners of Dotty's.

<doc id="2903379" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2903379" title="Proprotein convertase 1">
Proprotein convertase 1

Proprotein convertase 1, also known as prohormone convertase, prohormone convertase 3, or neuroendocrine convertase 1 and often abbreviated as PC1/3 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the "PCSK1" gene. PCSK1 and PCSK2 differentially cleave proopiomelanocortin and they act together to process proinsulin and proglucagon in pancreatic islets.
Function.
PC1/3 is an enzyme that performs the proteolytic cleavage of prohormones to their intermediate (or sometimes completely cleaved) forms. It is present only in neuroendocrine cells such as brain, pituitary and adrenal, and most often cleaves after a pair of basic residues within prohormones but can occasionally cleave after a single arginine. It binds to a protein known as proSAAS, which also represents its endogenous inhibitor. PC1 is synthesized as a 99 kDa proform quickly converted to an 87 kDa major active form, which itself is nearly completely cleaved to a 66 kDa active form within neuroendocrine cells.
Proprotein convertase 1 is the enzyme largely responsible for the first step in the biosynthesis of insulin. Following the action of proprotein convertase 1, a carboxypeptidase is required to remove the basic residues from the processing intermediate and generate the bioactive form of insulin. Another prohormone convertase, proprotein convertase 2 plays a more minor role in the first step of insulin biosynthesis, but a greater role in the first step of glucagon biosynthesis. The knockout of proprotein convertase 1 is not lethal in mice or humans, most likely due to the presence of the second convertase, although mice lacking proprotein convertase 1 activity show a number of defects including slow growth.
Proprotein convertase 1 is a calcium (Ca2+) activated serine endoprotease (meaning that a serine residue is part of the active site that hydrolyzes the peptide bond within the substrate). It is related to the bacterial enzyme known as subtilisin. There are nine subtilisin homologs in mammals; in addition to proprotein convertase 1 and 2, other members of this enzyme family include furin, PACE4, PC4, PC5/6, PC7/8, PCSK9, and SKI1/S1P.
Clinical significance.
Variants in the PCSK1 gene may be associated with obesity.

Delta Boötis

Delta Boötis (δ Boo, δ Boötis) is a double star in the northern constellation Boötes. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of approximately from the Earth. This star is sometimes called Princeps, meaning "prince" or "prime" in Latin. The origin of this name is unclear, although it usually appears in an astrological context. The It has an apparent visual magnitude of this star is 3.5, making it visible to the naked eye even during a Full Moon.
In Chinese, (), meaning "Seven Excellencies", refers to an asterism consisting of δ Boötis, 42 Herculis, τ Herculis, φ Herculis, χ Herculis, ν1 Boötis and μ1 Boötis. Consequently, δ Boötis itself is known as (, .)
Properties.
This system consists of a pair of stars located in physical proximity to each other and sharing a similar motion through space, suggesting that they may form a binary star system. Based upon their angular separation and their distance, they have a projected physical separation of 3,800 Astronomical Units (AU). However, their separation along the line of sight from the Earth remains uncertain, so all that can really be said is that they are separated by at least 3,800 AU. If they are gravitationally bound to each other, it requires a minimum of 120,000 years to complete an orbit.
The brighter member of the pair has a stellar classification of G8 III, indicating that it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved into a giant star. It now has a radius more than ten times the radius of the Sun. Compared to the Sun, this star appears deficient in elements other than hydrogen and helium—what astronomers term the star's metallicity. The outer envelope of this star has an effective temperature of 4,847 K, which is what gives it the characteristic yellow hue of a G-type star.
The secondary component has a stellar classification of G0 V, which suggests it is a main sequence star that may be similar in physical properties to the Sun. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 7.81, making it much less luminous than the primary component.

Elizabeth Yates (mayor)

Elizabeth Yates (ca. 1845 - 1918) was the mayor of Onehunga borough in New Zealand for most of 1894. She was the first female mayor anywhere in the British Empire. Onehunga is now part of the city of Auckland. 
Life.
She was born Elizabeth Onan in Caithness, Scotland and came to New Zealand with her family in 1853, and apparently lived in the Onehunga area from 1855 on. She married Michael Yates, master mariner, in 1875. He was on the Onehunga Borough Council, a councillor from 1885 and mayor from 1888 to 1892. She was already involved in politics through her strong support of the women's suffrage movement, as well as participation in the debates of the Auckland Union Parliament. 
Earlier in 1893, after her husband had stood down from his post due to ill health in 1892, she had accepted the nomination for the office of mayor and in November defeated her opponent, F. W. Court, at the polls (also automatically becoming a Justice of the Peace) in a close race decided by only 13 votes. The election made international news and brought her congratulations from Premier Richard Seddon and Queen Victoria.
However, she met strong opposition from a hard core of local councillors, town clerks and members of the public (four councillors and the town clerk resigned in response to her election), and they often disrupted meetings and orchestrated opposition to her every proposal. It is noted by some critics that she did not help her own cause by being 'tactless' and 'dictatorial' in her manner. Only a year later, she was defeated roundly at the polls. Even her opponents had to concede however, that she had been very effective during her short tenure, having liquidated the borough debt, established a sinking fund, reorganised the fire brigade, upgraded roads, footpaths and sanitation, and having personally lobbied the government to authorise the reopening of the Waikaraka cemetery.
She later returned as a councillor to the Borough Council for two years between 1899 and 1901. She died in 1918 after a long time in a mental hospital.

Lambda Boötis

Lambda Boötis (λ Boo, λ Boötis) is a star in the constellation Boötes.
Lambda Boötis is a white A-type main sequence dwarf with an apparent magnitude of +4.18. It is approximately 97.1 light-years from Earth. Lambda Boötis is the prototype of a group of rare stars known as Lambda Boötis stars, all of which are dwarf stars with unusually low abundances of metals in their spectra. Its diameter has been directly measured to be 1.7 times that of the Sun.
Name.
This star, along with the "Aselli" (θ Boo, ι Boo and κ Boo), were Al Aulād al Dhiʼbah (ألعولد ألذعب - "al aulād al dhiʼb"), "the Whelps of the Hyenas".
"Al Aulād al Dhiʼbah" or Aulad al Thiba was the title of this star in the catalogue of stars in "Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars".
In Chinese astronomy, Lambda Boötis is called 玄戈, Pinyin: Xuángē, meaning "Sombre Lance", because this star is marking itself and stand alone in "Sombre Lance" asterism, Purple Forbidden enclosure (see : Chinese constellation). 玄戈 (Xuángē) westernized into Heuen Ko, but the name "Heuen Ko" was designated for γ Boötis (Seginus) by R.H. Allen, with the meaning is "the heavenly spear"

Pulse (2006 film)

Pulse is an 2006 American horror film and remake of the Japanese horror film, "Kairo"; "Pulse" was written by Wes Craven and Ray Wright, and directed by Jim Sonzero. The film stars Kristen Bell, Ian Somerhalder, Christina Milian and a cameo by Brad Dourif.
Plot.
When Josh Ockmann (Jonathan Tucker) enters a dark university library intending to meet his friend Douglas Zeigler (Kel O'Neill), he is attacked by a humanoid spirit that sucks the life force out of him. Some days later, Josh's girlfriend, Mattie Webber (Kristen Bell), visits his apartment, seeing evidence that it has not been well kept. Josh tells Mattie to wait in the kitchen while he walks off. While waiting she finds Josh's pet cat, locked in a closet dying from severe malnutrition. But when she rushes to tell him, she finds he has committed suicide by hanging himself with an Ethernet cable.
Mattie and her friends begin to receive online messages from Josh asking for help but assume that Josh's computer is still on and that a virus is creating the messages. Mattie learns that Josh's computer has been sold to Dex McCarthy (Ian Somerhalder), who finds a number of strange videos on the computer. Mattie receives a package that Josh mailed two days prior to his death. Inside are rolls of red tape and a message telling her that the tape keeps "them" out, although he does not know why. Later, Dex visits Mattie and shows her video messages Josh was sending to Ziegler. Josh had hacked Ziegler's computer system and then distributed a virus. This virus had unlocked a portal that connected the realm of the living to the realm of the dead. Josh believed he had coded a counter to the virus and wanted to meet Ziegler at the library. Josh's counter-program is found on a memory stick taped inside the PC case with red tape.
Dex and Mattie visit Zeigler and find his room entirely plastered in red tape. They believe the red tape keeps the spirits out. Zeigler tells them of a project he worked on where he found "frequencies no one knew existed." Opening these frequencies somehow allowed the spirits to travel to the world of the living. Zeigler also tells them that these spirits "take away your will to live" and where to find the main server infected with the virus. Dex and Mattie find the server and upload Josh's fix, causing the system to crash and the spirits to vanish. Moments later, however, the system reboots and the spirits return leaving Mattie and Dex with no option but to flee the city by car. Over the car radio, Mattie and Dex hear a radio report from the Army announcing the location of several "safe zones" where there are no Internet connections, cell phones, or televisions. As Dex and Mattie drive to a safe zone, the film concludes with a voice-over from Mattie saying "We can never go back. The cities are theirs. Our lives are different now. What was meant to connect us to one another instead connected us to forces that we could have never imagined. The world we knew is gone, but the will to live never dies. Not for us, and not for them," and clips of abandoned cities, including a window of an apartment with Josh looking through it.
Release and reception.
The film's planned release date was March 3, 2006, but was delayed until August 11, 2006. Upon release, "Pulse" was widely panned by critics, with a 10% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus "Another stale American remake of a successful Japanese horror film, "Pulse" bypasses the emotional substance of the original and overcompensates with pumped-up visuals and every known horror cliche."
The film grossed over $8 million in its opening weekend in the United States. By its close on October 12, 2006, the film had grossed just over $20 million in the U.S., along with the foreign box office total just over $7.5 million, for a worldwide take of almost $28 million, compared with a production budget of approximately $20.5 million. As a DVD rental, the film has grossed a further $25 million.
Sequels.
Two direct-to-video sequels — ' and ' — have been released. "Afterlife" was released September 30 and "Invasion" on December 23, 2008, both were written and directed by Joel Soisson, writer of ' and writer/director of ' and "".

Menotti Del Picchia

Paulo Menotti Del Picchia (March 20, 1892 — August 23, 1988) was a Brazilian poet, journalist, and painter. He is associated with the Generation of 1922, the first generation of Brazilian modernists.
Del Picchia was educated in the law, and was a practicing attorney in Itapira when he began writing poetry. He moved to São Paulo, the city of his birth, and became acquainted with Mário de Andrade and the other young modernists in the city. He was a member of the Group of Five, along with Andrade, poet Oswald de Andrade, and painters Tarsila do Amaral and Anita Malfatti, and was one of the key participants of the Week of Modern Art in São Paulo, in February 1922, a watershed event in the history of modernism of arts in Brazil.
Because del Picchia outlived his literary generation, he received in person much more honor for his role in the creation of "Modernismo" than any of his youthful colleagues. By the time of his death he had received most of the highest governmental, academic, and private honors in Brazil, and his house in Itapira is now a museum.
He occupied the 28th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1943 until his death in 1988.

Roman de Brut

Roman de Brut or Brut is a verse literary history of Britain by the poet Wace. Written in the Norman language, it consists of 14,866 lines.
It is based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's "Historia Regum Britanniae", and was probably begun around 1150 and finished in 1155. It was intended for a Norman audience interested in the legends and history of the new territories of the Anglo-Norman realm, covering the story of King Arthurius and taking the history of Britain all the way back to the mythical Brutus of Troy.
The "Brut" was the most popular of Wace's works and survives in more than 30 manuscripts or fragments. It was used by Layamon as the basis for his "Brut". It contained a number of significant elaborations of Geoffrey, including the first mention of King Arthur's Round Table.

Dump leaching

Dump leaching is an industrial process to extract precious metals and copper from ores.
Dump leaching is similar to heap leaching, however in the case of dump leaching ore is taken directly from the mine and stacked on the leach pad without crushing where, in the case of gold and silver, the dump is irrigated with a dilute cyanide solution that percolates through the ore to dissolve gold and silver. The solution containing gold and silver exits the base of the dump, is collected and precious metals extracted. The resultant barren solution is recharged with additional cyanide and returned to the dump.
This method of leaching is usually suitable for low grade ores because it is very low cost. However, it operates with slow kinetics and may take up about 1 to 2 years to extract 50% of the desired mineral.

Rossi was born in Caserta. Not yet nineteen years old, he voluntarily enlisted and fought in World War I. After the war, moved by opposition to the socialists' attitude of hostility towards war veterans and their sacrifices and by contempt of the incapable political class of bounding idealists, he approached the nationalists of the "People of Italy" (directed by Benito Mussolini), a newspaper with which he collaborated from 1919 to 1922.
During that time, however, he met Gaetano Salvemini, with whom he formed a long-lasting bond of respect and friendship, and he moved definitively and radically further from the positions they were bringing to the fascist ideology.
He died in Rome in 1967.

Eastern Distributor

The Eastern Distributor is a long motorway in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Part of the M1, it links the Sydney central business district (CBD) with the Airport. The centre-piece is a tunnel running from Woolloomooloo to Surry Hills.
The motorway is tolled in one direction (northbound) with the toll plazas at Woolloomooloo and at the William Street exit. As of January 2013, the toll for cars/motorbikes is $6.00 (including GST) and $12.00 (including GST) for other vehicles. The toll will be removed in 2048 when the contract held by Airport Motorway Limited (AML) expires.
This motorway is part of the Sydney Orbital Network. For about half its length, it is in a trench inside South Dowling Street. The motorway provides a southbound exit for Lachlan Street/Dacey Avenue, a northbound exit for Cleveland Street, northbound entrance ramp from Cleveland Street and connections to William Street. There are also connection to the Cross City Tunnel, giving motorists direct connections under the city to the Western Distributor. There are also northbound/southbound entry/exits to Moore Park Road and Anzac Parade. Southbound motorists were later found to be entering the Eastern Distributor from the Cross City Tunnel access point and immediately attempting to cross three lanes for the Anzac Parade off-ramp. Permanent traffic obstacles are now in place to prevent this and users are now referred to the Lachlan Street/Dacey Avenue exit instead.
History.
The need for an Eastern Distributor was first talked about in 1951. It was not until the election of the state Labor government in 1995, led by premier Bob Carr that the project was initiated.
At in length, the Eastern Distributor was built to link the Sydney central business district with Sydney Airport via the already existing Southern Cross Drive (freeway). It was designed to ease congestion and to reduce the time to travel from the city to the airport. Construction involved 5,000 workers and was undertaken by Leighton Contractors for Airport Motorway Limited. Privately built, the Eastern Distributor is also privately owned and operated by Transurban, with state government planning, support and management during construction. At a cost of million, the motorway was opened on 19 December 1999, except for the William Street on and off ramps which were opened on 23 July 2000, just in time for the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympic Games. The term of private ownership is 48 years after which the road will revert to government ownership on 23 July 2048.
Two separate tunnel subcontractors began excavating the northbound tunnel in January 1996, working at either of the tunnel—that is, Surry Hills and Woolloomooloo. Seven roadheaders were utilised for the tunnel boring, with the rock ceiling then reinforced with rock bolts and shotcrete. On 4 December 1998 the two teams were shaking hands in the middle– beneath Taylor Square. Actual construction started in August 1997 and by March 1999 all digging was complete, after of soil, largely Sydney Hawkesbury Sandstone was removed–equal to 40,000 truckloads.
The project's centrepiece is the piggyback tunnel under one of Australia's most densely populated urban areas, necessitated due to the requirement of three lanes in each direction within the existing roadway corridor. The unique double-deck, three lanes per direction design comprises a large, single tunnel excavation. At mid-height through the excavation, a precast concrete ledge forms the base of the northbound tunnel, with the southbound tunnel slotting below. As a result, only one tunnel roof was created with the lower southbound carriageway built in a slot. According to the Australasian Tunnelling Society, no records are available of any piggyback tunnel (rail or road) where the upper carriageway has been carried on prestressed concrete planks resting on sidewall ledges. In the main tunnel there is a central length of where the span is typically greater than , and of note, there is no record of any road tunnel with spans greater than this where permanent roof support comprises rockbolts and shotcrete only and with vertical unsupported sidewalls of rock. The tunnel's claim to fame at the time it was built was that at across at its widest point, it was the widest tunnel in the world. This point occurs where the William Street on ramp tunnel merges with the main tunnel. At , the tunnel is also notably large from the ceiling to the floor.
The tunnels of the Eastern Distributor are equipped with the full range of services required in a modern road tunnel for the comfort and safety of the road user: lighting, ventilation, drainage, closed circuit television surveillance, fire fighting and emergency control systems.

<doc id="2903477" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2903477" title="Mr. Oizo">
Mr. Oizo

Mr. Oizo (; born 14 April 1974) is the stage name of French electronic musician and film director Quentin Dupieux. His pseudonym is a corruption of the French , meaning "bird". He is currently signed to French electronic music record label Ed Banger Records.
Beginning.
Quentin Dupieux was born on 14 April 1974 in Paris. At the age of 12, he found a camera and started taking photographs. At 17, he began to play music to illustrate his images, and he bought his first synthesizer. In 1997, Laurent Garnier of the record label FCom bought a car from Mr. Oizo's father. Garnier then found out about Dupieux's talents and let him direct the music video for his song "Flashback". Later, Dupieux was signed to FCom, which he released his first EP, "#1".
"Flat Beat".
Dupieux released "Flat Beat" in January 1999, a track comprised mainly of a repeated bass loop and a drum sample from "Put Your Love in My Tender Care" by The Fatback Band. In an interview with "XLR8R" magazine, Dupieux stated that it took him only two hours with a Korg MS-20 to produce. However, Flat Beat became a hit throughout Europe in 1999, becoming the best-known Mr. Oizo release. The track was featured in a series of Levi's jeans TV commercials, which featured a yellow puppet named Flat Eric nodding his head to the rhythm while riding in an old, beat-up car. Flat Eric was also featured in the song's music video. The "Flat Beat EP" has sold over three million copies.
"Analog Worms Attack".
After "Flat Beat", Oizo spent two months creating his first full album, "Analog Worms Attack", which was released in 1999. The album's name was derived from the album's production – it was composed entirely using analog equipment. The record scratching effects were provided by Mr. Oizo's friend Feadz. "Flat Beat" appeared as a bonus track after the five minutes of silence following the final track "Analog Wormz Sequel". There are a total of three singles off of this album. A version of "No Day Massacre" without any record scratching exists on the Flat Beat EP, titled "Monday Massacre".
"Moustache (Half a Scissor)".
"Moustache (Half a Scissor)" was Mr. Oizo's second studio album. Released in 2005, the album was composed exclusively using computers as he had by that time decided to eschew the use of analog equipment. The extensive time it took to remodel his studio and master the use of computers in composing electronic music is cited as the reason for the long hiatus between "Analog Worms Attack" and "Moustache (Half a Scissor)". Before its public release, a promo CD was released onto the internet featuring three tracks not on the original release: "CPU","Nazis", and "A Nun."
Some songs on the promo differ from the released album versions. For example, "Nurse Bob" is much longer on the final release whilst the promo version splices vocal samples into a much shorter version. This is his only album not to have its debut release on vinyl; in January 2011 it was released through Brainfeeder.
Ed Banger Records.
Mr. Oizo's first EP released on Ed Banger Records is called "Transsexual". The EP features the track "Patrick122", which is a re-working of the 1979 disco track "Do It at the Disco" by Gary's Gang. The track appeared on Mr. Oizo's MySpace page in 2006 under the title "Patrick122".
On 16 October 2008, his MySpace page had another video appear: a promo for his upcoming album, "Lambs Anger". The first single off the Record was "Positif", which was released 3 days after "Lambs Anger". On 15 March 2009, the second single off the album was released, "Pourriture", whose EP features some reworked titles by Oizo himself and a remix of Erreur Jean by Arveene & Misk.
"Lambs Anger".
"Lambs Anger" is Mr. Oizo's first studio album released by Ed Banger Records, the label he chose after his split with F Communications, who notoriously referred to "Moustache (Half a Scissor)" as "unlistenable". "Positif" and "Pourriture" were chosen as the album's singles. It includes a track, "Steroids", which features his label-mate Uffie. The track "Two Takes It" is a cover of the song "It Takes Two" by Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock that features samples of "Let's Start The Dance" by Hamilton Bohannon; the song also features an unknown artist by the name of "Carmen Castro", that bares resemblance to that of Uffie.
Collaborations with Uffie.
Mr. Oizo and Uffie first collaborated on her second single, "Ready to Uff", in 2006. Since then he has produced the following tracks for Uffie: "Dismissed", "Hot Chick", "F1rst Love" (which charted at number 18 in Belgium), "Steroids" and "MCs Can Kiss".
Mr. Oizo provided both production work and songwriting for Uffie's 2010 debut album, "Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans". He worked alongside Feadz, SebastiAn, Mirwais, J-Mat and Uffie to produce and write the album. He produced the first single from the album, "MCs Can Kiss", which peaked at number 48 Japan and 97 in France. He also produced the tracks "Art of Uff", "F1rst Love", "Our Song" and "NeuNeu".
Production and equipment.
In his early years, Mr. Oizo used a Korg MS-20, an Akai S1000, and an Atari 1040 computer. Mr. Oizo is known currently for strong use of computers in his music. As he stated in an interview with "XLR8R", he started using computers to avoid having to plug in four different appliances, and because the result of music is more or less the same. His first album to switch to all computers was "Moustache (Half a Scissor)". In "Lambs Anger", Mr. Oizo used a Macintosh G5 running Logic Pro to compose all of the songs. During his DJ sets, he uses two CDJs.
Filmmaking.
Mr. Oizo's first feature film, "Steak" was released in France on 20 June 2007.
On 25 September, Oizo wrote on his Twitter feed that his next film would be titled "Rubber". Shooting for the absurdist thriller started 27 October 2009. In the November 2009 issue of "Mixmag", electronic music duo Justice stated that they would be working on the soundtrack for "Rubber", saying they had to 'finish working on the soundtrack for Mr. Oizo's new film before we start recording for the new album'. However, only Gaspard Augé of the duo worked on the soundtrack, collaborating with Oizo himself. The film had a United States Video on Demand release.
A new film entitled "Wrong" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012.
Another film by Dupieux called "Wrong Cops" is being produced by Realitism Films. As its website says, "It is a filthy 90 minute comedy about some disturbed cops. It is not a sequel to "Wrong"." The first thirteen-minute chapter of the film premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.

Frank Ney

Frank James Ney (May 12, 1918 – November 24, 1992) was a mayor of Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada, serving for twenty-one years. Ney also served a term as a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. He was known for his outgoing personality, his habit of attending civic events and dressing up like a pirate for the appearances, and playing a central role in initiating the bathtub races across Georgia Strait from Nanaimo to Vancouver. He was father to eleven children, several of whom were adopted from various ethnic or racial origins, with his first wife, Jocelyn (Floyer) . He was an active skier, swimmer, figure skater and boater. During the 1950/1951 season he was President of the Nanaimo Figure Skating Club.
He also, while Mayor, initiated the creation of cut-away corners of sidewalk curbs in downtown Nanaimo after spending one day in a wheelchair in order to experience for himself the difficulties in getting around experienced by those in wheelchairs.
Biography.
Born in London, England, Ney served in the RAF and RCAF as a pilot during World War II. He was a resident of Nanaimo from 1946 until his death in 1992. He was Mayor of Nanaimo from 1968 to 1984, and 1987 to 1990, and a Social Credit Member of the Legislative Assembly for Nanaimo from 1969 to 1972.
Ney was also a member of the Society of Notaries Public of British Columbia from January 1956, until his death in November 1992, and had a very busy notarial practice in Nanaimo. He was president of the Society from 1968-1969.
Ney, with his brother Bill, formed the Great National Land and Investment Corporation in 1964, was involved in real estate (as president of Nanaimo Realty Ltd.), and promoted the economic development of Vancouver Island. He is perhaps most famous for the purchase and subdivision of Protection Island in 1960 and selling it under a pirate-promotion theme. 
He participated in many local and provincial associations, and was Chairman of the Nanaimo Centennial Committee (1967), responsible for organizing the inaugural Great Bathtub Race between Nanaimo and Vancouver. He was the first Chairman and Admiral of the Loyal Nanaimo Bathtub Society, established in 1968 to continue the bathtub race as an annual event. Ney was made Freeman of the City of Nanaimo in 1984. 
A bronze statue of Ney is sited at Swy-a-Lana Lagoon in downtown Nanaimo.
An extensive archive relating to Ney's personal and professional life are held in the Frank. J. Ney fonds at the Nanaimo Community Archives. 
A biography about Frank Ney, based mainly on collected remembrance and stories about Ney, was published by Paul Gogo in 1995 ("Frank Ney: A Canadian Legend").
A satirical musical review built around Ney's "Pirate Frank" persona premiered at Nanaimo's Western Edge Theatre in March 2007. 
A play about him, "Being Frank" by writer G. Kim Blank, was performed at the Port Theatre in Nanaimo in April 2007, produced by TheatreOne and directed by Burton Lancaster; there is also a book by Blank based on the play entitled "Being Frank", from which the following portrayal of Ney's character is given in the Preface:
" . . . you watch Frank, but you don’t necessarily understand Frank, or even keep up with him. . . . what is immediately apparent is how many people will go on record to say they were “good friends” of Frank, though no one on the planet could have that many 'good friends.' But the effect he had on people, the way he moved around, his outward nature, his ability to be everywhere and always visible, the twinkle in his eye and the blarney of his gesture—all of this must have made him feel like everyone’s friend. Yet, despite this—and here is where his wonderfully maddening complexity sets in—those closest to him inevitably said something much more intriguing: they didn’t really know him; they didn’t really know what moved him forward and what made him tick, what got him going in the morning and kept him up at night."

Mailoc

__NOTOC__
Mailoc or Maeloc was a 6th-century bishop of Britonia, a settlement founded by expatriate Britons in Galicia, Spain. He represented his diocese, referred to as the "Britonensis ecclesia" or "British church", at the Second Council of Braga in 572. Records of the council refer to his see, the "sedes Britonarum" ("See of the Britons"), which is likely the monastery of Santa Maria de Bretoña. Mailoc's name is clearly Brythonic, deriving from the Celtic *"Maglācos", thereby providing evidence for the British presence in the area.

Harry Craft

Harry Francis Craft (April 19, 1915 – August 3, 1995) was an American Major League Baseball player and manager. Born in Ellisville, Mississippi, he was a center fielder for the Cincinnati Reds from 1937 to 1942. Craft attended Mississippi College, threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . He was the first manager in Houston Major League history as skipper of the expansion Houston Colt .45s, later the Astros.
Playing career.
A well-praised defensive center fielder, Craft was an average hitter in his short career. His best season came, basically, as a rookie (he had 42 at bats the previous season) in 1938. On June 15 of that year, Craft caught the ninth-inning pop fly (batted by Leo Durocher) to make the final out in the historic game that gave Johnny Vander Meer his second consecutive no-hitter. That same season, Craft batted a solid .270 as the Reds' everyday center fielder with 15 home runs and 83 RBIs in 151 games. He had 165 hits that season in 612 at bats. All those numbers ended up being career-highs. The next two years were Cincinnati's best seasons as they went to the World Series in both, winning in 1940 against the Detroit Tigers. However, Craft did not play a large part in the victory, having only 1 at bat. He ended up with just one postseason hit, which came the year before.
On June 8, 1940, he hit for the cycle in a 23–2 win over the Brooklyn Dodgers. Craft joined the Navy in 1942. By the time he returned to baseball his skills had deteriorated and he never made it back to the major leagues as a player.
In six seasons, Craft had an all-time .253 batting average with 44 home runs and 267 RBIs. He accumulated 14 stolen bases and 237 runs scored. He had 533 hits in 2104 at bats.
Managerial career.
Minor League.
Craft began his managing career in the farm system of the New York Yankees. He was Mickey Mantle’s first manager in professional baseball — in 1949 with Independence of the Kansas-Oklahoma-Missouri League. In 1950, Craft would manage Mantle again with the Joplin Miners in the Western Association. Eventually, Craft progressed to the AAA level with the Kansas City Blues of the American Association in 1953–1954. 
"I was lucky to have Harry as skipper my first two years," Mantle said years later. "He started me out right." [http://thedeadballera.com/Obits/Craft.Harry.Obit.html] Craft would also manage Roger Maris at the Major League level in 1958–1959 with the Kansas City Athletics, just before the young right fielder was traded to the Yankees. Maris credited Craft with helping him with his hitting.
During his time with the Chicago Cubs, Craft briefly returned to managing at the Minor League level for the Triple-A affiliate Houston Buffs of the American Association in 1961. He would be the last manager for the Houston Buffs, before being promoted to become the first manager of the big league club when that city officially began its National League Houston Colt .45s in 1962.
Major League.
Kansas City Athletics.
Craft went from the minor league Blues to the Major League Athletics in 1955, their first year in Kansas City after transferring from Philadelphia, when he was named a coach on the staff of Lou Boudreau. After over 2½ losing seasons, Boudreau was released on August 6, 1957, and Craft was named his successor. Craft's Athletics went 23–27 to finish the season. He then lasted two more full campaigns, and , before his firing. Craft finished with a 162–196 record at Kansas City. His best finish was seventh place in the eight-team American League.
Chicago Cubs.
In 1961, Craft was a member of Chicago Cubs owner Phil Wrigley's ill-fated "College of Coaches". From 1961 to 1965, the team had no permanent manager, and rotated the "head coach" job among its coaching staff. Craft led the Bruins for 16 games in 1961, coming out 7–9, as one of four head coaches that year. He spent the latter half of the year managing the Buffs, then the Cubs' top farm team.
Houston Colt .45s.
Craft became the first skipper in the history of the expansion Houston Colt .45s the following year. He managed them from 1962 to 1964, before his replacement by Lum Harris in the closing days of the '64 season. He ended 191–280 with the Colt .45s, never having managed an above .500 team in all or parts of seven seasons as a big league manager. He remained in the game, however, as a scout and farm system official for the Baltimore Orioles, San Francisco Giants and the Yankees, retiring in 1991.
Craft ended his managing career with a 360–485 record in 849 games, a .426 winning percentage. His best finish was seventh place. The authors of "The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book", Brendan C. Boyd & Fred C. Harris, Little Brown & Co, 1973, had this to say about Craft's career on p. 52, perhaps unfairly given what little he had to work with on those clubs: "Of course, if you are really lousy at what you do, there's always a chance you can work your way into management, that being the American Way... Harry Craft managed three teams in a seven year span... They finished 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 9th. Do I detect a trend in there somewhere?"
Death.
He died after a long illness in Conroe, Texas (approximately forty miles north of Houston), at the age of 80 on Thursday, August 3, 1995. He had two children, a son, Thomas H. Craft, and a daughter, Carole Ann.

<doc id="2903506" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2903506" title="The Popeye Show">
The Popeye Show

The Popeye Show is a cartoon anthology series that premiered on November 11, 2001, on Cartoon Network. Each episode would include three unedited "Popeye" theatrical shorts from Fleischer Studios and/or Famous Studios. The show was narrated by Bill Murray (not to be confused with the film actor), who would give the audience short facts about the history of the cartoons as filler material between each short. Animation historian Jerry Beck served as a consultant and Barry Mills served as writer and producer. A total of 45 episodes were produced, consisting of a total of 135 shorts.
Significance.
Prior to the premiere of "The Popeye Show", most television airings of theatrical "Popeye" cartoons bore the logos of Associated Artists Productions, the company that bought the films from Paramount Pictures for television distribution. This is due to the films having been sold in the 1950s, when most movie studios did not want to be associated with television. As a result, A.A.P. was required to replace the original Paramount logos with their own. For "The Popeye Show", efforts were made to present these films as close to their original theatrical form as possible: some of the cartoons shown were copies that actually had their original Paramount titles intact, while others needed to have their original titles simulated through the process of digital video editing.
The show focused mostly on the Fleischer "Popeye" shorts and early Famous Studios shorts that were originally filmed in black-and-white. For all episodes, the first two shorts were from this era. Sometimes the third cartoon would be a color cartoon from Famous Studios, but on many occasions an entire episode would entirely be made of black-and-white cartoons. While selecting the color entries that would air, the only ones that were initially selected were those that were in the Turner vaults with their original titles. The only color cartoons to have their original titles recreated were those shown in the last episode of Season 3, and all episodes of Season 4. 
In season 1, an original copy of "Popeye, The Ace of Space" (1953) with its original titles was shown for the first time on TV. This particular cartoon was originally shown in 3D, and therefore had a unique opening sequence. It also had a unique ending sequence that was not shown on syndication prints because it involved the Paramount logo being formed from the smoke of Popeye's pipe.
The black and white short "The Hungry Goat" (1943) was kept from being shown in earlier seasons because it required extra attention to recreate the ending as close to original as possible. The original ending involved Popeye's nemesis in the short, a goat, laughing at Popeye while watching the end of the very cartoon they were in, and, like "The Ace of Space", involved the Paramount logo.
The 1945 short "Tops in the Big Top", which did not open with the standard "Popeye" theme music, but had a rendition with a circus theme, had its original soundtrack restored for the program. Similarly, a version of "W'ere On Our Way to Rio" (1944) was prepared with the opening soundtrack restored, but the show was cancelled before it could be included in any episodes.
Controversy.
Two episodes from Season 1 were initially skipped, and did not make their TV debut until reruns. The reason was because the two episodes had cartoons that the executives at Cartoon Network would not pass for unedited airings. Episode #10 was originally supposed to have "Popeye the Sailor", which was a Betty Boop cartoon in which Popeye makes his theatrical debut. This particular cartoon had a scene at the carnival where Popeye and Bluto play a ball-toss game where the target is an African American stereotype. Episode #11 had the short "Happy Birthdaze", in which Popeye murders his Navy buddy Shorty in a scene that is usually cut from TV broadcasts. When Episode #10 finally aired, "I Eats My Spinach" replaced "Popeye the Sailor", while Episode #11 aired with no changes made, and "Happy Birthdaze" was shown uncut.
A later episode featured an unedited version of the World War II themed "Spinach Fer Britain" (1943), a cartoon in which Popeye battles Nazis. This particular cartoon is rarely shown outside of any scheduled airings of "The Popeye Show".
Episode guide.
Below is an episode guide for "The Popeye Show". All episodes are listed in production order. There were a few occasions where episodes were skipped and therefore did not air in their proper order.

Gear Daddies

The Gear Daddies are a rock band originally from Austin, Minnesota. Randy Broughten (electric and steel guitar), Nick Ciola (bass), Billy Dankert (drums and vocals), and Martin Zellar (guitar, harmonica and vocals) played their first shows together in 1984. They released singles and albums between 1986 and 1992 and became an important part of the Twin Cities music scene. Most songs were written by Zellar, though Dankert also had several of note, including crowd favorite "Time Heals".
Their most notable mainstream success was when Zellar and Broughten played "Stupid Boy" on "Late Night with David Letterman" in 1991. Ciola and Dankert did not play on the show because many bands simply sat in with The World's Most Dangerous Band. Zellar had this to say of the experience: "I was so nervous, and it happened so quick. I couldn't tell you what the hell happened. I got done, and I was walking back and said to Randy (Broughten), 'Did I sing all the words? Did I do that?' When I watched it that night in the hotel room I had no recollection of having lived it."
"Zamboni" is their best-known song, having been featured in the movies "" and "Mystery, Alaska", as well as on television program "Malcolm in the Middle". It is often played during intermissions at hockey games throughout North America.
After the dissolution the band, Zellar began an active career of performing and recording with the band that became known as Martin Zellar and the Hardways, taking with him long-time friend and bassist Nick Ciola.
Electric guitarist Randy Broughten is currently a physical education teacher in Rosemount, Minnesota. As well as being a member of The Cactus Blossoms, he has also been the steel guitar player for many years with Minneapolis country band Trailer Trash, who are known for their annual Christmas shows, and who also had a cameo in the mockumentary film "Dill Scallion".
Drummer James "Billy" Dankert is a professional visual artist as well as a musician. 
As of the present, all four members of the Gear Daddies reunite several times a year to perform throughout the Midwest.
The Gear Daddies were an influence on a number of bands that emerged in the upper Midwest in the late 1980s through the 1990s, including Johnny Clueless, The Billy's, Violet, Shoot Lucy, Dazy Head Mazy, Groundhouse and Six Mile Grove.

Wang Ying (Water Margin)

Wang Ying is a fictional character in the "Water Margin", one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. He ranks 58th of the 108 Liangshan heroes and 22nd of the 72 Earthly Fiends. He is nicknamed "Stumpy Tiger".
Background.
The "Water Margin" describes Wang Ying as a short man with sparkling eyes. He is rough, impatient, lecherous, highly skilled in martial arts and capable of taking on 100 opponents at the same time. He is nicknamed "Stumpy Tiger" for his short stature.
Wang Ying was initially a carriage driver. He met a group of rich men and was overcome by greed and robbed them. He was arrested later and imprisoned, but managed to escape and had become an outlaw since then. He goes to Mount Qingfeng and leads a bandit gang there together with Yan Shun and Zheng Tianshou.
Joining Liangshan.
Song Jiang passes by Mount Qingfeng on his journey to Qingfeng Fort to join Hua Rong. He is captured by Wang Ying's gang, who want to kill him and make soup from his heart and liver. Song Jiang sighs, "Am I, Song Jiang, destined to die just like that?" Wang Ying and the other leaders are stunned when they hear the name "Song Jiang". They release Song Jiang and apologise to him after recognising him as the famous philanthropist.
Earlier on, Wang Ying had kidnapped the wife of Liu Gao, the official in charge of Qingfeng Fort, and he wants to rape her. Song Jiang stops him and manages to persuade him to release the woman. Later, Liu Gao's wife repays kindness with evil and accuses Song Jiang of attempting to rape her. Liu Gao is furious and he has Song Jiang arrested and imprisoned. Hua Rong tries to save Song Jiang but he is tricked by Huang Xin and captured as well. Song Jiang and Hua Rong are escorted as prisoners by Huang Xin's men to Qingzhou (in present-day Shandong). Along the way, Wang Ying and the bandits from Mount Qingfeng attack the convoy and rescue the captives. Song Jiang and the bandits defeat imperial forces later and capture Qingfeng Fort, killing Liu Gao and his family for revenge. Wang Ying follows the outlaws as they return to Liangshan Marsh in triumph.
Marriage to Hu Sanniang.
During the battle at the Zhu Family Village, Hu Sanniang rides forth to challenge the outlaws to a duel. Wang Ying is aroused when he sees a female warrior and attempts to defeat and capture her. Unexpectedly, Wang Ying is defeated by Hu Sanniang and captured by her. He is only released after the outlaws defeat the Zhus and capture the village. Hu is captured by Liangshan's Lin Chong shortly after she defeated Wang Ying. Song Jiang succeeds in persuading Hu Sanniang to join Liangshan as well. Later, with Song Jiang as the matchmaker, Hu Sanniang is married to Wang Ying.
Campaigns and death.
Wang Ying becomes one of the leaders of the Liangshan cavalry after the Grand Assembly. He follows the heroes on their campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces after they have been granted amnesty by the emperor. During the Fang La campaign, Wang Ying is assigned to attack the enemy city of Muzhou. He encounters the enemy general Zheng Biao, who uses his magic to confuse him and spear him to death.

<doc id="2903539" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2903539" title="Grand Prix (video game)">
Grand Prix (video game)

Grand Prix is a Formula One Grand Prix motor racing-themed video game, and one of the first side-scrolling racing video games. It was designed and programmed by David Crane for the Atari 2600 video game console, and published by Activision in 1982.
Activision republished the game in the anthologies "Activision's Atari 2600 Action Pack for Windows 95" (1995) and "Activision Anthology" (2002), and again via Microsoft's Game Room service in May 2010.
"Grand Prix" was the first Atari 2600 game to feature shaded objects in color. When David Crane developed an Atari 2600 programming technique for painting large, multicolored sprites on the screen, he made a color pattern that reminded him of Grand Prix racing stripes. This inspired him to design a Grand Prix racing game to apply his new technique.
Gameplay.
The player drives a Formula One car in a time trial on one of four race tracks, each of which has a different difficulty level. Difficulty is gauged by the length of the course, the number of cars and oil slicks on the track, and the number of bridges to cross.
The player views the race from a top-down perspective, and the screen scrolls from right to left. The player's car maneuvers only on a vertical axis, and loses a little speed when it does so. The joystick's button is the throttle: Depressing it accelerates, and releasing it decelerates. Pressing the joystick leftward applies the brake. The transmission audibly shifts as the player's car accelerates and decelerates.
"Grand Prix" is a time trial, and the competing cars are obstacles rather than competition for the finish line. The player's car can easily outpace the other cars, but if it collides with one, its speed drops lower than that of the impacted car. Driving over an oil slick causes the player's car to skid slightly sideways, but does not slow it down. Once every scale mile, the player crosses a narrow bridge over blue water. Colliding with any wall of the bridge stops the car, and the player must slowly gain speed to continue. A patch of oil slicks precedes a bridge. This both forewarns the player, and presents a hazard while trying to steer onto the bridge.
Competing cars cross neither bridges nor the finish line; if they approach either one, they stop suddenly.
Race tracks.
Each of the game's four race tracks is a straight lined with trees. The shortest, simplest course is Watkins Glen. Brands Hatch is about twice as long as Watkins Glen, and has one bridge. Le Mans is about three times as long as Watkins Glen, and has two bridges. Monaco is about five times as long as Watkins Glen, and has three bridges.
The tracks in "Grand Prix" are named after real Formula One circuits. Watkins Glen International, near Watkins Glen, New York, was the site of the United States Grand Prix from 1961 to 1980. Brands Hatch, near the English town of Swanley, hosted the British Grand Prix in even-numbered years from 1964 through 1986. The city of Le Mans is the site of the Bugatti Circuit, which hosted the French Grand Prix in 1967. Circuit de Monaco, a street circuit in Monte Carlo, first hosted the Monaco Grand Prix in 1950. After four years of Formula Two races, the annual F1 Monaco Grand Prix resumed, and has returned each year since 1955.
Although the race tracks in "Grand Prix" are named after these circuits, they are not reproductions of them.

Autherine Lucy

Autherine Juanita Lucy was the first black student to attend the University of Alabama, in 1956.
She was born on October 5, 1929 in Shiloh, Alabama and graduated from Linden Academy in 1947. 
She went on to attend Selma University in Selma, and the all-black Miles College in Fairfield - where she graduated with a BA in English in 1952.
Later in 1952, at the encouragement of and along with a Miles classmate, Pollie Ann Myers, she decided to attend the University of Alabama as a graduate student but, knowing that admission would be difficult due to the University's admission policies, she and Myers approached the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for help. Thurgood Marshall, Constance Baker Motley, and Arthur Shores were assigned to be their attorneys. While they started preparing her case, she worked as a secretary. Court action began in July 1953.
On June 29, 1955, the NAACP secured a court order preventing the University from rejecting the admission applications of Lucy and her friend based upon their race. Days later, the court amended the order to apply to all other African-American students seeking admission. The Supreme Court upheld this in Lucy v. Adams on October 10, 1955. On the very eve of the day Lucy and her friend (who had married to become Pollie Myers Hudson) were to register, the University Board of Trustees rejected Hudson on the grounds of her "conduct and marital record", but reluctantly allowed Lucy to register. However, she was barred from all dormitories and dining halls. At least two sources have said that the board hoped that without Hudson, the more outgoing and assured of the pair and whose idea it originally was to enroll at Alabama, Lucy's own acceptance would mean little or nothing to her, and she would voluntarily choose not to attend. But Hudson and others strongly encouraged her, and on February 3, 1956, Lucy enrolled as a graduate student in library science, becoming the first African American ever admitted to a white public school or university in the state. 
On the third day of classes, a hostile mob assembled to prevent Lucy attending classes. The police were called to secure her admission but, that evening, the University suspended Lucy on the grounds that it could not provide a safe environment. Lucy and her attorneys filed suit against the University to have the suspension overturned. However, this suit was not successful and was used as a justification for her permanent expulsion. University officials claimed that Lucy had slandered the university and they could not have her as a student.
The University of Alabama finally overturned her expulsion in 1980, and in 1992, she earned her Masters degree in Elementary Education from the University that she had applied to decades earlier. In a complete reversal of spirit from when she was first admitted there, the university named an endowed scholarship in her honour and unveiled a portrait of her in the student union overlooking the most trafficked spot on campus. The inscription reads "Her initiative and courage won the right for students of all races to attend the University." 
She is a sister of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority.

Zhang Heng (Water Margin)

Zhang Heng is a fictional character in the "Water Margin", one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. He ranks 28th of the 36 Heavenly Spirits of the 108 Liangshan heroes and is nicknamed "Boatman".
Background.
The "Water Margin" describes Zhang Heng as a man seven "chi" tall, with triangular eyes, yellow whiskers, red hair and crimson eyes. He is an excellent swimmer and he can leap out of the water from wave to wave like flying fish. Even harsh weather conditions do not deter him from performing superhuman feats in water. He is nicknamed "Boatman" for his marine abilities.
Zhang Heng lives at the foot of Mount Gu with his younger brother Zhang Shun. The brothers engage in some illegal trading on the nearby Xunyang River to earn a living. Zhang Heng is an impulsive gambler and loses large sums of money from frequent gambling. He decides to become a pirate in disguise as a ferryman to rob his customers.
Once, Song Jiang is pursued by the Mu brothers after offending them and he boards Zhang Heng's boat to escape from them in desperation. In the middle of the river, Zhang Heng attempts to kill Song Jiang by forcing him off the boat. Just then, Li Jun appears and he stops Zhang Heng. Li Jun then introduces Song Jiang to Zhang Heng and the others, who recognise him as the famous philanthropist. Zhang Heng apologises to Song Jiang and becomes friends with him.
Becoming an outlaw.
After the Liangshan outlaws storm the execution ground in Jiangzhou (present-day Jiangxi) and rescued Song Jiang from death, Zhang Heng, Li Jun and several others fetch them at the riverbank after they defeat the pursuing soldiers. Zhang Heng and company ferry the heroes back to Liangshan Marsh and Zhang decides to join the Liangshan cause after that. He becomes a leader of Liangshan's navy and make great contributions to Liangshan in the naval campaigns against the enemies of Liangshan.
When Huyan Zhuo leads the imperial army to attack the outlaws, he orders the artillery commander Ling Zhen to bombard Liangshan with heavy cannon fire. Zhang Heng leads the navy to sabotage the cannons and lure Ling Zhen into a trap. Ling Zhen pursues the outlaws to the middle of the river where his boat is capsized and he is captured. Song Jiang persuades Ling Zhen to join Liangshan. When the imperial army attack Liangshan a second time under Guan Sheng's command, Zhang Heng attempts to launch a surprise offensive on the enemy but he falls into a trap and is captured. He is only released after Guan Sheng surrenders and joins Liangshan.
Campaigns and death.
After the Liangshan outlaws are granted amnesty by the emperor, Zhang Heng follows them on their campaigns against the Liao invaders and other rebel forces. During the Fang La campaign, Zhang Shun is killed in the battle of Hangzhou. After Zhang Shun's death, his spirit possesses Zhang Heng and he slays the enemy general Fang Tianding for revenge. Zhang Shun's spirit leaves his brother's body after that and Zhang Heng recovers from his trance. He is deeply saddened by the loss of his brother and collapses on the spot, dying from illness not long later.

Tourism in Melbourne

Tourism in Melbourne deals with attractions, events and facilities in Melbourne, Australia of special interest to tourists. Melbourne is a major Australian tourist destination as well as the country's second most populous city. In 2009, the city was visited by approximately 15.9 million domestic and 1.4 million international tourists.
Melbourne has a wide variety of attractions, facilities, activities, such as sporting events and cultural and fashion events which are popular with tourists. In 2008, Melbourne exceeded Sydney for the first time in terms of money spent by domestic tourists on a per capita basis. However, in overall tourist revenue, Melbourne earned considerably less.
Popular sites and events.
Melbourne has a large number of year-round events and attractions, such as:
Restaurants.
Melbourne is also noted for the number, variety and quality of its restaurants. Major restaurant strips are found throughout the city and the suburbs, including:
Cafes and nightlife.
Melbourne contains all manner of pubs, bars, and nightclubs. The CBD contains a wide variety of venues, from the ubiquitous faux-Irish pubs and more traditional Australian hotels, through some very upmarket wine bars, serious jazz venues on Bennetts Lane, fashionable nightclubs and dance venues (where the Melbourne Shuffle was born), are often hidden away down dark alleyways.
The restaurant strips, particularly Brunswick Street have their own bars, some of which are the best rock venues in Melbourne. King Street, on the southern side of the CBD, was traditionally a nightclub strip and still hosts several, but many are now exotic dancing venues. Chapel Street, Prahran, is perhaps the trendiest, most upmarket nightlife strip. Bayside St Kilda is the home of several huge music venues including the famous Esplanade Hotel (known as 'the Espy'), the Prince of Wales, and The Palace.

<doc id="2903548" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2903548" title="Bosentan">
Bosentan

Bosentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist used in the treatment of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). It is licensed in the United States, the European Union and other countries by Actelion Pharmaceuticals for the management of PAH under the trade name Tracleer.
Mechanism of action.
Bosentan is a competitive antagonist of endothelin-1 at the endothelin-A (ET-A) and endothelin-B (ET-B) receptors. Under normal conditions, endothelin-1 binding of ET-A or ET-B receptors causes constriction of the pulmonary blood vessels. By blocking this interaction, bosentan decreases pulmonary vascular resistance. Bosentan has a slightly higher affinity for ET-A than ET-B.
Clinical uses.
Bosentan is indicated mainly for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. In 2007, Bosentan was also approved in the European Union for reducing the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease.
In the United States, Bosentan is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) in patients with WHO Class II-IV symptoms, to improve exercise capacity and decrease the rate of clinical worsening.
Warnings.
Due to potential hepatotoxicity, the FDA requires monthly monitoring of liver function tests while taking Bosentan.
Bosentan use requires hematocrit monitoring due to potential onset of anemia.
Hormone-based contraception is not possible in women taking Bosentan, due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. Therefore, other highly reliable forms of contraception should be used instead.
Bosentan is contraindicated in pregnancy because of its teratogenicity (Pregnancy Category X).

Greater Southwest International Airport

Greater Southwest International Airport , originally Amon Carter Field, was the commercial airport serving Fort Worth, Texas, from 1953 until 1974. Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) opened in 1974 a few miles north of the airport to replace both Greater Southwest and Dallas Love Field as the single main airport for the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex (though Love Field survives). The area is now a commercial/light-industrial park serving DFW International, centered along Amon Carter Boulevard, which was originally constructed from the old airport's north-south runway.
Early history.
As far back as 1927 the cities of Fort Worth and Dallas had proposed a regional airport that would serve the entire metropolitan area. Initial plans did not come to fruition, and after World War II, Fort Worth decided to move the primary airline traffic from Meacham Field to a new facility, Amon Carter Field (airport code "ACF"). Fort Worth annexed a finger of land to the east, extending the city limits to encompass the new site.
American, Braniff, Central, Continental, Delta, Eastern, Frontier, and Trans-Texas Airways operated from the airport, which had three paved runways and a rather elaborate terminal building (including gold-plated murals). The airport never reached capacity and saw its traffic dwindle while traffic at nearby Love Field in Dallas continued to grow.
The April 1957 OAG shows 97 scheduled departures a day Tuesday to Thursday, more than half to Dallas. American Airlines had 30, Braniff 22, Trans-Texas 19, Continental 13, Delta 7, and Central 6.
On December 20, 1959, jet service began with American Airlines Boeing 707 flights to Los Angeles. Delta Air Lines later started Convair 880 jet nonstops to Los Angeles and New Orleans. 
In 1960, the airport was renamed Greater Southwest International Airport (airport code "GSW") in a failed attempt to attract passengers. In the same year the city of Fort Worth purchased the airport.
By 1967, Braniff was operating British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven twin jets as well as Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops while Continental was flying Douglas DC-9 jets and Vickers Viscount turboprops into the airport according to these airline's system timetables at the time. American and Eastern also operated Boeing 727 jetliners from the airfield according to their respective system timetables.
Decline and closure.
In 1964, the Federal Aviation Administration, tired of funding separate airports for Dallas and Fort Worth, announced that it would no longer support both. The Civil Aeronautics Board ordered the two cities to finally come up with a plan for a regional airport, and in 1965 a parcel of land north of Greater Southwest was selected for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. As traffic boomed at Dallas-Love Field it slumped at Fort Worth as most carriers tried to pull out; the last one left around the end of 1968. When Dallas-Fort Worth International opened in 1974, the FAA closed the runways at Greater Southwest as a safety precaution.
After closure.
On May 30, 1972, Delta Air Lines Flight 9570 crashed at Greater Southwest International Airport while performing "touch and go" training landings. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that wake turbulence from another training flight, an American Airlines DC-10, had caused the Delta DC-9 to lose control as it neared touchdown. As this was a training flight, only four people were aboard the flight 9570 at the time of the crash: three crew and an FAA operations inspector. All were killed.
Following the closure of the airport, Runway 17/35 became Amon Carter Boulevard for several years before it was torn up and replaced with an actual street. a small section of the taxiway and run-up area of Runway 17 still exists on the north side of State Highway 183. American Airlines expanded its headquarters to new buildings on the airport site during the 1980s and 1990s (the airline's former hangar had remained in use as a reservations center for several years before it was demolished). The airport's IATA airport code, GSW, is still in use by the American Airlines Flight Academy, which sits across State Highway 360 from the airport site.

Market neutral

An investment strategy or portfolio is considered market-neutral if it seeks to avoid some form of market risk entirely, typically by hedging. In order to evaluate market-neutrality, it is necessary to specify the risk being avoided. For example, convertible arbitrage attempts to fully hedge fluctuations in the price of the underlying common stock.
A portfolio is truly market-neutral if it exhibits zero correlation with the unwanted source of risk. Market neutrality is an ideal, which is seldom possible in practice. A portfolio that appears to be market-neutral may exhibit unexpected correlations as market conditions change. The risk of this occurring is called basis risk.
Equity-market-neutral.
Equity-market-neutral is a hedge fund strategy that seeks to exploit investment opportunities unique to some specific group of stocks while maintaining a neutral exposure to broad groups of stocks defined, for example, by sector, industry, market capitalization, country, or region. 
The strategy holds long/short equity positions, with long positions hedged with short positions in the same and related sectors, so that the equity-market-neutral investor should be little affected by sector-wide events. This places, in essence, a bet that the long positions will outperform their sectors (or the short positions will under perform) regardless of the strength of the sectors. Equity-market-neutral strategy occupies a distinct place in the hedge fund landscape by exhibiting one of the lowest correlations with other alternative strategies. 
Evaluating the Hedge Fund Research index returns for 28 different strategies from January 2005 to April 2009 showed that equity-market-neutral strategy had the second lowest correlation with any of the other strategies, behind only short-bias funds that typically have a negative correlation with all other funds. This result is not surprising given that each fund utilizes the unique insights of a manager, and these insights are not replicated across funds.

Zhang Qing (Gardener)

Zhang Qing is a fictional character in the "Water Margin", one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. He ranks 102nd of the 108 Liangshan heroes and 66th of the 72 Earthly Fiends. He is nicknamed "Gardener".
Background.
Zhang Qing is from Mengzhou, Jiaozuo, Henan. The novel describes him as a man with a weird looking face and thin facial hair. He used to work as a gardener in Guangming Monastery. He has a violent quarrel with the monks and kills them in a fit of anger and burns down the monastery. He goes to Cross Slope and becomes an outlaw there.
One day, he attempts to rob an old man but the man defeats him in a fight. The old man recognises Zhang Qing's interest in martial arts and accepts him as his disciple. Zhang Qing marries the old man's daughter, Sun Erniang. The couple run a tavern at Cross Slope. They lure unwary travellers into their tavern for drinks and knock them out using drugs. They kill their victims and rob them of their valuables. They also make meat buns with human flesh fillings from their victims and serve them to customers. Zhang Qing travels around the area and mingles with other "jianghu" figures. He earns himself the nickname "Gardener".
Meeting Wu Song.
Lu Zhishen passes by Cross Slope after seeing Lin Chong safely to Cangzhou and he stops at the tavern for a rest. He is served with drugged wine by Sun Erniang and becomes unconscious. Zhang Qing returns home and he saves Lu Zhishen from his grisly fate. They become sworn brothers.
In a later chapter, Wu Song passes by Cross Slope on his way to exile in Mengzhou and he stops at the tavern for a break. The unsuspecting guards are knocked out after drinking the drugged wine. Wu Song is more wary and he sees through Sun Erniang's designs. He pretends to be unconscious as well. He awakes and attacks Sun Erniang when she is about to kill him. Wu Song defeats Sun Erniang in a fight easily. Just then, Zhang Qing returns home and he stops the fight. Zhang Qing and Sun Erniang apologise to Wu Song and Zhang becomes sworn brothers with Wu as well.
Wu Song flees from Mengzhou after killing Jiang Zhong and Inspector Zhang. He reaches the tavern at Cross Slope and receive help from Zhang Qing and Sun Erniang. They disguise him as a travelling monk and recommend him to join the outlaw band on Mount Twin Dragons. The couple join them later. They follow the outlaws back to Liangshan Marsh after the great battle at Qingzhou (in present-day Shandong).
Campaigns and death.
Zhang Qing becomes one of the scout leaders of Liangshan after the Grand Assembly and stationed in the tavern west of Liangshan. He is tasked with making preparations to receive the imperial envoy from the emperor, who grants the outlaws amnesty. He follows the heroes on their campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces after they have been granted amnesty. He is killed in the battle of Shezhou (present-day She County, Anhui) during the Fang La campaign.

NER Class T3

North Eastern Railway Class T3, classified Q7 by the LNER is a class of 0-8-0 steam locomotive designed for heavy freight. Five were built by the NER in 1919 and a further 10 by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1924.
Performance.
The first of the T3s, No.901 was outshopped from Darlington Works in November 1919. A month later the NER organised a test train, over the Newcastle to Carlisle line, including a brake van and the company's dynamometer car to record the locomotive's performance. No.901 had 1,402 tons in tow but handled the load with ease, registering both high power and steady acceleration. There were no problems starting on a 1 in 298 grade and on the return, with a reduced load of 787 tons, the engine was untroubled by gradients as severe as 1 in 107.
LNER.
Despite their prowess, the original quintet of T3s was not augmented by the North Eastern Railway, a move that would have pleased footplate crews who disliked having to lubricate and maintain the centre cylinder and valve gear. Instead the enlargement of the class came under LNER. it authorised the construction of ten additional T3s and these emerged from Darlington Works during 1924.
Of the new engines two were allocated to York and a further four went to Hull. The remaining four gravitated to their natural habitat, Tyne Dock depot near South Shields. It was there eventually that all 15 T3s/Q7s congregated. Here they performed the role they were designed for. This was to haul 700 ton rakes of iron ore hoppers to the steelworks at Consett 1000 ft above sea level. On the steepest section, as severe as 1 in 35 in places, one 0-8-0 pulled while another pushed.
British Railways.
All 15 passed into British Railways ownership in 1948 and they were numbered 63460-63474. They remained master of their task till the arrival of BR Standard Class 9F 2-10-0s in the 1950s. With the loss of their bread and butter work British Railways retired all 15 of the Q7s in November and December 1962.
Preservation.
One, NER 901 (BR 63460) has survived and is currently on display at Darlington Railway Centre and Museum. It is the newest exhibit at the museum.

African Peer Review Mechanism

The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) is a mutually agreed instrument voluntarily acceded to by the member states of the African Union (AU) as a self-monitoring mechanism. It was founded in 2003.
The mandate of the APRM is to encourage conformity in regard to political, economic and corporate governance values, codes and standards, among African countries and the objectives in socio-economic development within the New Partnership for Africa's Development.
Origins of APRM.
The 37th Summit of the Organisation of African Unity held in July 2001 in Lusaka, Zambia, adopted a document setting out a new vision for the revival and development of Africa—which was to become known as the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).
In July 2002, the Durban AU summit supplemented NEPAD with a Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance. According to the Declaration, states participating in NEPAD ‘believe in just, honest, transparent, accountable and participatory government and probity in public life’. Accordingly, they ‘undertake to work with renewed determination to enforce’, among other things, the rule of law; the equality of all citizens before the law; individual and collective freedoms; the right to participate in free, credible and democratic political processes; and adherence to the separation of powers, including protection for the independence of the judiciary and the effectiveness of parliaments.
The Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance also committed participating states to establish an African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) to promote adherence to and fulfilment of its commitments. The Durban summit adopted a document setting out the stages of peer review and the principles by which the APRM should operate.
In March 2003, the NEPAD Heads of State and Government Implementation Committee, meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, adopted a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the APRM. This MOU effectively operates as a treaty; it came into effect immediately with the agreement of six countries to be subject to its terms. Those countries that do not accede to the document are not subject to review. The March 2003 meeting also adopted a set of ‘objectives, standards, criteria and indicators’ for the APRM. The meeting agreed to the establishment of a secretariat for the APRM and the appointment of a seven-person ‘panel of eminent persons’ to oversee the conduct of the APRM process and ensure its integrity.
Participation.
The APRM is a voluntary mechanism open to any AU country . A country formally joins the APRM upon depositing the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) of March 9, 2003 at the NEPAD Secretariat.
As of early-2012, 33 countries had formally joined the APRM by signing the MOU on the APRM. Algeria, Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda signed the MOU in March 2003; Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gabon, Mali and Senegal in April and May 2003; Mauritius in July 2003; Egypt and Benin in March 2004; Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Tanzania, in July 2004; Sudan and Zambia in January 2006; São Tomé and Príncipe in January 2007; Djibouti in July 2007, Mauritania in January 2008, Togo in July 2008; Cape Verde in 2009; Liberia in January 2011; and Equatorial Guinea in July 2011.In January 2012,Professor Mohamed-Séghir Babès, the outgoing Chairman of the Panel of Eminent Persons announced the expected accession of Niger and Guinea which brings the total number of states to 33.
Review.
The APRM process is based on a "self-assessment" questionnaire developed by the APR Secretariat. It is divided into four sections: democracy and political governance, economic governance and management, corporate governance, and socio-economic development. Its questions are designed to assess states' compliance with a wide range of African and international human rights treaties and standards. The questionnaire was formally adopted in February 2004, in Kigali, Rwanda, by the first meeting of the APR Forum, made up of representatives of the heads of state or government of all states participating in the APRM. 
Before the questionnaire was adopted and after the initial plans for the APRM were laid down by South Africa and others, some press reports stated that, after pressure from other African countries like Nigeria and Libya, Thabo Mbeki changed his mind and did not want political governance to be included within the APRM reviews. According to the reports, Mbeki believed that review of political governance was something for the African Union. Jean Chrétien, then president of the G8, sent a letter to Mbeki demanding clarifications and expressing his concern that these AU organs are ‘politicized’ and will therefore not produce credible reviews. In a public letter Mbeki denied the charges and stated that countries would voluntarily subject themselves to review of all aspects of good governance, including political, under the APRM, but that other AU institutions might be more appropriate to deal with some issues.
Types of review.
As originally envisaged in the APRM Base Document adopted at the AU Durban summit in 2002, there are four types of review:
1- Base review: This is carried out within eighteen months of a country becoming member of the APRM;
2- Periodic review: Every two to four years;
3- Requested review: Any country can request an additional review for its own reasons;
4- ‘Crisis’ review: Early signs of impending political or economic crisis would also be sufficient cause to institute a review.
However, in practice, it seems likely that only base reviews will be conducted for the foreseeable future: the review process for the first four countries—Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius and Rwanda—has taken at least eighteen months (Ghana) and perhaps up to three years or more (Mauritius), since they were first announced in Kigali in February 2004.
APRM structures.
APR Forum.
This is the Committee of the Heads of State and Government of the countries voluntarily participating in the APRM. It is the highest decision-making body and could be considered like the board of directors which has the final say over the whole process. They appoint the APR Panel, look after the funding, discuss the country reports, apply the peer pressure and transmit the reports to the relevant AU structures.
APR Panel.
This can be considered as the management or the executive of the APRM that directs and manages its operations . They are ‘appointed to oversee the review process to ensure the integrity of the process, to consider review reports and to make recommendations to the APR Forum’ . According to the base document, and repeated in the Organisation and Processes document, its precise mission and duties however are supposed to be outlined in a Charter, which will also spell out reporting arrangements to the APR Forum . However, more than three years after the installation of the Panel, this Charter has still not been written.
The panel consists of 7 eminent persons of ‘high moral stature and demonstrated commitment to the ideals of Pan Africanism’ who, moreover, have ‘expertise in the areas of political governance, macro-economic management, public financial management and corporate governance’ . Its composition should also reflect a regional, gender and cultural balance . The panel members are nominated by the participating countries, short listed by a Committee of Ministers, appointed by the APR Forum and serve for up to four years (five for the chairman) .
Each country to be reviewed is assigned to one of the seven eminent persons, who consider and review reports, and make recommendations to the APR Forum. As of July 2006, the seven ‘eminent persons’ were: Marie Angelique Savane (Senegal), Chairperson; Adebayo Adedeji (Nigeria); Bethuel Kiplagat (Kenya); Graça Machel (Mozambique); Mohammed Babes (Algeria, replacing the original Algerian appointee, Mourad Medelci); Dorothy L. Njeuma (Cameroon); and Chris Stals (South Africa). 
On 30 January 2012,former Deputy President of South Africa, Baleka Mbete, was elected at the 16th Summit of the Committee of Participating Heads of State and Government of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APR Forum)to sit on the Panel of Eminent Persons. She is the only sitting representative of a Southern African country, and will join panel members Barrister Julienne Ondziel Gnelenga (Republic of Congo), Barrister Akere T. Muna (Cameroon), Ambassador Professor Okon Edet Uya (Nigeria), Ambassador Ashraf Gamal (Egypt), Dr. Mekideche Mustapha (Algeria), Ambassador Fatuma Ndangiza Nyirakobwa (Rwanda) and the Panel’s newly elected Chairperson, Professor Amos Sawyer (Liberia). Following a decision to increase the size of the body, the APR Forum intends to elect a ninth Panel member at the 17th Summit in June 2012.
APR Secretariat.
The Secretariat provides ‘the secretarial, technical, coordinating and administrative support services for the APRM’. It is ‘supervised directly by the Chairperson of the APR Panel at the policy level and in the day-to-day management and administration by an Executive Officer’. The Secretariat is based in Midrand, South Africa, not far from the NEPAD secretariat.
APR Country Review Team.
They are appointed by the APR Panel, one of whose members heads the team, and are ‘constituted only for the period of the country review visit’. Their composition is ‘carefully designed to enable an integrated, balanced, technically competent and professional assessment of the reviewed country’.
APR focal point.
This is a national mechanism set up by a participating country in order to play a communication and co-ordination role. It should serve, as Ayesha Kajee puts it, ‘as the liaison between national structures and continental ones such as the APR Secretariat and the APR Panel’. It should also, in conjunction with the National Co-ordinating mechanism, ‘develop, co-ordinate and implement the in-country mechanisms of preparing for peer review and hosting the country review team during the review visit’. The precise form of the Focal point is left to the country's discretion, but according to the APR Forum, it ‘should be at Ministerial level or a High-Level Official reporting directly to the Head of State or Government and with access to all national stakeholders’.
National co-ordinating structure.
Here the actual implementation of the APRM at the national level happens. The country's self-assessment happens here by conducting, as the MOU mandates, ‘broad-based and all-inclusive’ consultation of key stakeholders in the public and private sectors. In addition, together with the Focal point it should ‘develop, co-ordinate and implement the in-country mechanisms of preparing for peer review and hosting the country review team during the review visit’. As with the Focal point, countries have a discretion as to how this is implemented.
Review process.
Preliminary phase or ‘Support Mission’.
The country support mission primary purpose is to ‘ensure a common understanding of the philosophy, rules and processes of the APRM’ and to help countries who need support with ‘aspects of the national processes’. The Guidelines further specify what the latter might mean, namely help with ‘institutional and organizational arrangements for involving major stakeholders’ in the review process, with the development of a realistic Programme of Action and with expertise not readily available in the country . In order to do this they will meet with the authorities in the country responsible for the APR process (the APR Focal Point) and with representatives of all the major stakeholders.
Stage one.
The first stage is preparatory for both the APR Secretariat and the national authorities. The country in question has to answer a detailed questionnaire, on the basis of which a self-assessment is completed. The APRM Secretariat for its part will make a background study of the country's governance and development. After this has been shared with the country concerned and other partner institutions and after the self-assessment has been made, the country in question will issue a draft Programme of Action . In the development of this Programme that participation of all stakeholders must be ensured, ‘including trade unions, women, youth, civil society, private sector, rural communities and professional associations’ . In the Programme it will suggest a time-bound framework for implementing the Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance. After the Programme of Action and questionnaire have been submitted to the APR Secretariat, the Secretariat will draw up an Issues Paper. It is possible that on the basis of this paper the Secretariat will decide that certain issues need a more in-depth assessment (‘Technical assessments’) before that stage two is initiated. If there are Technical Assessments, these can lead to the update of the Issues Paper and possibly the Programme of Action . The APRM Secretariat also makes a suggestion to the APR Panel regarding the composition of the Country Review team.
Stage two.
In the second stage the review team will visit the country and ‘carry out the widest possible range of consultations with the government, officials, political parties, parliamentarians and representatives of civil society organizations (including the media, academia, trade unions, business, professional bodies)’.
Stage three.
In the third stage the draft report is compiled. This report is based on the findings of the review team during their visit, the background research the APR Secretariat has made and on the Issues paper compiled by the APR Secretariat. The draft is then discussed with the government concerned. These discussions are meant ‘to ensure the accuracy of the report and to provide the Government with an opportunity both to react to the APR Team's findings and to put forward its own views on how the identified shortcomings may be addressed’. The report is supposed to evaluate a country's performance by taking into account the commitments made in the draft Programme of Action. It will also state what the remaining weaknesses are and recommend further action for the final Programme of Action.
Stage four.
The review team's report and the final Programme of Action compiled by the Government, is sent to the APR Secretariat and the APR Panel. Then the report is submitted to the APR Forum of participating heads of state and government for consideration and formulation of actions deemed necessary .
It is at this stage that the actual ‘peer pressure’ is applied if necessary. Here the full quotation of the APRM base document (par. 24) is in its place: "If the Government of the country in question shows a demonstrable will to rectify the identified shortcomings, then it will be incumbent upon participating Governments to provide what assistance they can, as well as to urge donor governments and agencies also to come to the assistance of the country reviewed. However, if the necessary political will is not forthcoming from the Government, the participating states should first do everything practicable to engage it in constructive dialogue, offering in the process technical and other appropriate assistance. If dialogue proves unavailing, the participating Heads of State and Government may wish to put the Government on notice of their collective intention to proceed with appropriate measures by a given date. The interval should concentrate the mind of the Government and provide a further opportunity for addressing the identified shortcomings under a process of constructive dialogue. All considered, such measures should always be utilized as a last resort."
Stage five.
According the paragraph 25 of the base document the report ‘should be formally and publicly tabled in key regional and sub-regional structures such as the Pan-African Parliament, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the […] Peace and Security Council (PSC) in May 2004, and the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) of the African Union.’. This is when the report will be publicly available.
After the review.
A country is then supposed to implement its Programme of Action. Implicit in the whole APRM formula is that foreign donors would kick in here and bear some, if not a large part, of the cost connected to the implementation of this plan of action that is supposed to improve the identified shortcomings in governance. After this base review is concluded, a periodic review should follow every two to four years.
Funding.
The APRM is primarily funded by contributions from participating countries, and funds from "development partners" such as Canada, the United Kingdom and the UNDP. The APRM reported contributions of some US$17.3 million in 2007, with US$10.5 million coming from development partners. Many member states failed to meet the minimum contribution of $100,000.

Nadir

The nadir (from / ALA-LC: "naẓīr", meaning "opposite") is the direction pointing directly "below" a particular location; that is, it is one of two vertical directions at a specified location, orthogonal to a horizontal flat surface there. Since the concept of "being below" is itself somewhat vague, scientists define the nadir in more rigorous terms. Specifically, in astronomy, geophysics and related sciences (e.g., meteorology), the nadir at a given point is the local vertical direction pointing in the direction of the force of gravity at that location. The direction opposite of the nadir is the zenith.
Nadir also refers to the downward-facing viewing geometry of an orbiting satellite, such as is employed during remote sensing of the atmosphere, as well as when an astronaut faces the Earth while performing a spacewalk.
The word is also used figuratively to mean the lowest point of a person's spirits, or the quality of an activity or profession.
The term nadir can also be used to represent the lowest point reached by a celestial body during its apparent orbit around a given point of observation. This can be used to describe the location of the Sun, but it is only technically accurate for one latitude at a time and only possible at the low latitudes. The sun is said to be at the nadir at a location when it is at the zenith at the location's antipode.
In oncology, the term nadir is used to represent the lowest level of a blood cell count while a patient is undergoing chemotherapy. A diagnosis of neutropenic nadir after chemotherapy typically lasts 7–10 days.

Fingallian

Fingallian or the Fingal dialect is an extinct variety of English formerly spoken in Fingal, Ireland. It is thought to have been an offshoot of Middle English, which was brought to Ireland during the Norman invasion, and was extinct by the mid-19th century. Although little is known of Fingallian, it is thought to have been similar to the Yola language of County Wexford. The surviving literature of Fingallian consists of two satirical or humorous poems, the short "Fingallian Dance" and the much longer "Purgatorium Hibernicum". Both poems are anonymous and are thought to be humorous parodies of Fingallian by non-native speakers, so their value from a linguistic point of view may be limited.
History.
Fingallian was spoken in the region of Fingal, traditionally the part of County Dublin north of the River Tolka, and now a separate county. It was spoken in the area near the northern border. The name "Fingal" is from the Irish "Fine Gall", or "territory of foreigners", probably a reference to a Norse settlement in the area. Linguist Alf Sommerfelt proposed the idea of a Norse influence on the Fingallian dialect, though later scholars have found no evidence of such a connection.
Like the Yola language of County Wexford, Fingallian is thought to have derived from Middle English, which was introduced by "Old English" settlers after the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. Middle English was well established in southeastern Ireland until the 14th century, when the area was re-Gaelicized and English was displaced. As such, the Yola and Fingal dialects would have been the only attested relicts of this original English variety in Ireland.
The Fingallian Dance.
The poem most likely to have been composed by a native speaker of Fingallian is "The Fingallian Dance", a brief, three-verse poem written between about 1650 and 1660. It is mildly indecent poem about a man going to see dancers at a bullring (bull fighting was practised in 17th century Ireland). Although the poem is likely to have been standardised when written down, it gives a flavour of Fingallian, particularly forms like "fat" for "what" or "fen" for "when". Other words that need explanation are "ame" 'them' and "plack-keet", 'part of a petticoat'.
Purgatorium Hibernicum.
The "Purgatoriam Hibernicum" is a humorous and bawdy burlesque or travesty on the Roman poet Virgil's "Aeneid". It exists in three versions: the original manuscript ("Purgatoriam Hibernicum"), another manuscript entitled "The Fingallian Travesty: the Sixt Book of Virgill's Aenoeids a la mode de Fingaule" (1670–5), and a printed version called "The Irish Hudibras" or "The Fingallian Burlesque" (1689).
Virgil's prince Aeneas and his noble lover Dido are transformed into a bumbling young Fingallian called 'Prince' Nees and a coarse ex-nun Dydy. The names of all the characters are converted into mock 'Irish' forms and the places mentioned in Virgil's text become places in Fingal. Part of the humour for the Anglo-Irish readers of the poem is that Nees and Dydy converse with each other in broad Fingallian. Although the intention is supposedly to mock their speech, it is rendered with such vitality and wit that the effect is actually to give the reader an appreciation of its richness.
The short extract below provides a good example of Fingallian. In it Nees encounters Dydy again and seeing her look pale and unwell realises that he may have been responsible for giving her the 'flame' or venereal disease. A few features need explanation: 'V' is used instead of 'W' in Fingallian; 'suggam' is a kind of straw rope'; Ful dea ro is derives from Irish "fuil Dé, a rogha" 'God's blood, my sweetheart':
Nees continues with an attempt to sweet talk Dydys and asks her for a 'pogue', but his fears are justified and Dydy is having none of it. She tells him that if he think he can have another 'bout' with her, he can think again – after he has "play'd the vagge" (been a wag) with her and given her the "bagge" (rejected her) she will "vatch de vales" ('watch the walls', be on guard) and foil his plan:
Then Dydy goes on her way in high dudgeon.
Letters from Ireland.
In John Dunton's "Letters from Ireland" (1698) he writes that in Fingal "they have a sort of jargon speech peculiar to themselves, and understand not one word of Irish, and are as little understood by the English". Dunton gives a sample of the language; a lamentation that a mother made over the grave of her son, who was a keen fisher and hunter. Note that "a roon" and "moorneeng" are from the Irish "a rúin" "(secret) love" (vocative) and "múirnín" "love" (lit. "little trust"):
<poem>
Ribbeen a roon
Ribbeen moorneeng
Thoo ware good for loand stroand and mounteen
For rig a tool and roast a whiteen
Reddy tha taakle
Gather tha baarnacks
Drink a grote at Nauny Hapennys
</poem>
This is roughly translated as:
<poem>
Robin my love
Robin my dear
Thou were good for land, strand and mountain
Good with a tool and roast[ing a Whiting
Ready the tackle
Gather the bannocks
Drink a groat at Nanny Halfpenny's 
</poem>
Modern Fingal English.
Although Fingallian is no longer spoken, a large number of dialect words unique to Fingal have survived, especially in traditional Fingal towns and villages such as Swords, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Garristown, Oldtown, Balrothery, and Naul. Major sources for these include glossaries in an article in the folklore Journal "Béaloideas" by J. J. Hogan and Patrick O'Neill and a book on Fingal lore entitled "Fair Fingall" by Patrick Archer.
Examples from Archer's Glossary include:

"Don't Stop (Wiggle Wiggle)" is a 1995 song by American hip-house duo The Outhere Brothers from their debut album "1 Polish, 2 Biscuits & a Fish Sandwich". The song peaked at number twenty two on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, and topped the charts in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Old Todd County Courthouse

Old Todd County Courthouse (1835) Todd County, Kentucky's second courthouse was built and completed in 1835. The courthouse is a sister building to the Green River Girls School which was built in the same year. Bricks used were fired on the site. The construction of the courthouse which occupies the center square in Elkton, was authorized by the Fiscal Court, Tuesday, November 11, 1834, at which time they arranged for the selection of a building site. 
The Commissioners further mandated the county to meet the cost in three payments, the first of which would come from unappropriated funds, which were being held by the sheriff. Thereafter, the balance would be remitted in two equal payments. R. Rowland designed the building and Jesse Russell, of Elkton, was employed to supervise the construction, along with Commissioner Hazel Petrie. There are two accounts of the building of the walls. Russell is said to have hired four brickmasons, each of whom was to construct a wall: the mason with the best wall was to receive a gold watch. 
In another account, Jesse Russell and another brick mason were said to have boasted on their masonry skills. To settle the dispute, each was told to build a wall. Each man bet upon himself and Russell's wall was superior. The building was completed in 1835.
In 1865, Union troops occupied the Confederate courthouse and later used it as headquarters. After the courthouse was abandoned, the Union troops left the building in shambles. The destruction of the structure brought anger to Todd Countians and six years later, an extensive remodeling project was completed which totally restored and updated the Courthouse.
The town clock was purchased by the city and county in 1888. The clock tower was added at a later time period, during the stick style period. During another restoration project in 1975 the courthouse was designated as a National Historic Landmark. The house is also protected by the National Park Service. In 1961 city officials voted to paint all woodworking and the clock tower white for lack of funds. The tower was originally painted in multiple colors. 
The interior architecture was destroyed in 1961 when the layout of the building was compromised and historical moldings and fireplaces were concealed. In the following years the court out-grew the courthouse and moved to a new location in southern Elkton. The courthouse currently stands in downtown Elkton and is owned by Todd County government and leased to the City of Elkton.

Midland Railway 156 Class

The Midland Railway 156 Class was a class of 2-4-0 tender engines built at Derby Works between 1866–1874. In total 29 of the class were built under the Midland Railway and 21 survived to become part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) fleet of engines in 1923. By then they were reduced to the humblest of roles. The LMS recognised the significance of the class and number 156 itself was ear-marked for preservation but the decision was over turned and the engine scrapped in 1932. However fifteen years later one of its classmates was spared.
Preservation.
One, 158A survives as a static exhibit in the Midland Railway - Butterley in Butterley, Derbyshire. The surviving example is not in as built condition. It has twice been reboilered and the front end rebuilt. The original tender was replaced a century ago.

List of products discontinued by Apple Inc.

The following is a list of Apple Inc. (formerly known as Apple Computer Inc.) software and hardware products that were superseded by improved versions, or discontinued, and are no longer manufactured. The first Apple product to be discontinued was the Apple I in 1977, superseded by the Apple II. The most recently discontinued products have been several iPod models including the iPod mini, replaced by the iPod nano. This list includes summarized descriptions and images of almost every known discontinued Apple product, including computer systems, software products, peripherals, iPods, Newtons, and miscellaneous products.
On September 1, 1998, Apple Computer published its first list abruptly dropping support for much of its discontinued product lines to date. Service providers were given little notice to stock up on existing parts inventory before Apple removed them from their databases.
Currently Apple classifies discontinued products in three categories: Vintage, Obsolete or Legacy, based on the level of support they continue to provide. Apple's current hardware support policy provides for service and repair of products for up to five years following their discontinuation, except only in California, USA (as required by statute), where products are guaranteed service for up to seven years after being discontinued. Products which fall into this additional two year window are referred to as Vintage. Products which have been discontinued for more than seven years are considered Obsolete and no service of any kind is offered, nor parts obtainable from Apple.
In 1997, Apple made changes to its technical support policy that resulted in a class action lawsuit. Essentially, Apple guaranteed free unlimited telephone support as long as an original customer owned certain Apple products purchased between 1993 and 1996. Apple subsequently dropped this support. However, the resulting settlement restored this phone based service as advertised, for all Legacy products. While hardware service is no longer available on any of these Obsolete models, free technical support is offered. Legacy models are indicated with an asterisk (*).

Media in Melbourne

Relative to most other Australian cities, Melbourne media is unusual in its size and diversity.
Melbourne Newspapers.
Melbourne has two major and one minor daily newspapers. Melbourne's daily newspapers include the compact format "The Age" owned by Fairfax Media(until recently the city's only broadsheet newspaper), the News Limited owned tabloid format "Herald Sun", and the free afternoon tabloid format "MX", also owned by News Limited.
A third major paper, the "The Argus" was discontinued in 1957. The "Herald Sun" was created from the merge of "The Sun News-Pictorial" and "The Herald" in 1990.
The weekly "Melbourne Observer "newspaper was established in 1969. It is showbiz oriented. It is on sale and available free online at www.melbourneobserver.com.au 
There are a variety of free, weekly newspapers focused on local suburban regions. These are usually distributed to households without subscription.
Melbourne is served by various newspapers published in languages other than English. These include newspapers published in Melbourne and those published elsewhere. There is also a wide variety of street press available in Melbourne.
Melbourne Television.
Melbourne is served by six free-to-air television networks. The three commercial television providers, the Seven Network, the Nine Network and the Ten Network have commenced broadcasting new digital only sub-channels including 7Two, 7mate, GEM HD, GO! and One HD. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation provides four channels, ABC1, ABC2, ABC3 and ABC News 24 from the Ripponlea and Southbank studios. ABC2, ABC3 and ABC News 24 are only available with digital receivers. SBS television also provides two television channels, SBS One on both analogue and digital and SBS Two on digital only (previously known as SBS World News Channel), dedicated to world news and entertainment coverage. Channel 31 is a public access community television station which screens mostly foreign-language television for migrant communities, and amateur lifestyle programs.
Melbourne has a large and thriving television industry that along with Sydney, produces most of the Australian prime-time television content. Melbourne produced television series include "Neighbours", "Kath & Kim", "Hey Hey It's Saturday", "The Footy Show (AFL)", "Blue Heelers", "Dancing with the Stars", Steven Spielberg's "The Pacific", "Rush", "Underbelly", "Thank God You're Here", "Rove Live", "Summer Heights High", "The 7PM Project", "The Marngrook Footy Show", "Double Take" and "Live From Planet Earth", Winners & Losers and House Husbands

Melbourne Radio.
Melbourne has a wide range of radio stations. For 2010, the Nielsen Company estimates the Melbourne radio market has 3,840,000 listeners.
Sports radio.
Melbourne has several radio stations dedicated to sports broadcasting. 
One such station is SEN 1116, which took over 3AK's old radio license and replaced it with a 24-hour sports format.
Sport 927 (formerly known as 3UZ) covers all sports but specialises in total coverage of Horse Racing, Harness Racing and Greyhounds.
Triple M, while generally focused on music broadcasting, is noted for its sports coverage (with hourly sports updates from personalities including Brett Phillips). Triple M is a contender in the Australian Football League (AFL) radio broadcasting rights - in October 2005 there were four Victorian radio stations that had the rights to broadcast AFL matches: Triple M, 3AW, ABC and K-Rock.
3AW's sport coverage consists of the show "Sports Today" with Dwayne Russell and Gerard Healy, as well as its AFL coverage.
774 ABC Melbourne's sports coverage includes the Coodabeen Champions who are a comedy-music group (led by Greg Champion) that usually appear on the morning of most cricket and AFL matches. They also cover a wide variety of sporting events, including taking BBC's Test Match Special, the Australian Open, and international and domestic cricket.
Talk radio.
The most notable locally-produced talk radio stations are 774 ABC Melbourne(part of the ABC Local Radio network), and 3AW which often achieves the highest ratings. Both stations feature extensive local news coverage and talkback. SEN 1116 is also a talk station focused on sports. Melbourne is also served by SBS Radio which broadcasts in a variety of languages, aimed at migrant communities.
Community radio.
Australia's most successful community radio station, 3RRR, is a Melbourne institution. SYN FM, at 90.7 FM, another community station, is staffed and presented entirely by youth up to age 26. Other community stations in Melbourne include 3PBS, which plays mostly specialist music programming, and 3CR, an AM radio station run by a broad coalition of left-wing activists. Melbourne is also home to Australia's first and only gay and lesbian community radio station, JOY 94.9.
In addition to the major players in Melbourne, there are many smaller radio stations catering to particular community interests. 3CR caters to a diverse range of community groups and community languages, 3XY 1422AM provides Greek language programming, 1593AM (Rete Italia) presents 24 hr/day Italian, 3CW 1341AM Chinese, and Pacific Islanders are now catered to on 3XX 1611AM which is better known for its 80s and 90s music during the day, and 3KND presents indigenous community programming. The FM band also features smaller suburban stations, and low powered services in various suburbs featuring programming ranging from dance music to English radio, Arabic programming and more. Light FM on 89.9 FM is Melbourne's community Christian station with the slogan of "Good friends, great music and a message of hope".
Music radio.
Melbourne has nine analogue music formatted radio stations. There are eight commercial (six on FM and two on AM) and the ABC's national youth broadcaster, Triple J (107.5 in Melbourne). 101.9 The Fox and Nova 100 compete directly with a Contemporary Hit format targeting the under 40s. 105.1 Triple M runs an adult oriented rock format and features live AFL coverage on the weekends during winter. Mix 101.1 is more female oriented with a hot adult contemporary format that is aimed at 25-54. Smooth 91.5 (previously, Vega and Classic Rock) is Melbourne's newest commercial station and is now running an easy adult contemporary format that largely appeals to those aged 35+. Gold 104 and 1377 3MP are also aimed 40+, with adult contemporary/gold formats with music primarily from the 70s and 80s. Magic 1278 also runs an adult contemporary/gold format but targets 55+ audiences with music from the 50s, 60s and 70s.
Digital radio.
Digital radio commenced in Melbourne on the 11 May 2009 and uses the DAB+ standard. Melbourne currently has fifty five digital stations. DAB+ reception is good in most of the metropolitan area but it is still patchy in fringe areas (in particular Geelong and the Mornington Peninsula). Digital stations have the advantage of a translator in the Melbourne CBD that provides better signal quality than analogue services in some Inner East and central suburbs. 
All of Melbourne's commercial, ABC, SBS stations, as well as Melbourne-wide community stations, simulcast their analogue broadcast on digital. The ABC, SBS and commercial networks also run additional digital only programmes. Digital stations include pop-up seasonal or festival formats, additional news, sport and specialist music genres such as dance, indie, jazz, chillout, country, love songs, Australian music, unsigned artists, Asian, Arabic as well as eighties and nineties only formats. Many of the digital stations are national formats and even those run by commercial stations are largely free from advertising at this stage.

Lucius Vorenus

Lucius Vorenus (given as L. Varenus in some translations) was one of the two soldiers of the 11th Legion (Legio XI Claudia) mentioned in the personal writings of Julius Caesar. The other soldier mentioned was Titus Pullo.
He appears, along with Titus Pullo, in Caesar's "Commentarii de Bello Gallico," Book 5, Chapter 44. The episode describes the two as centurions, approaching the first ranks, who shared a bitter personal rivalry. It relates how Pullo charged the enemy (the Nervii) in the heat of battle. Pullo casts his javelin into one of the enemy from a short distance, but his belt is simultaneously pierced by a spear, preventing him from drawing his sword, and he is surrounded by other Nervii. Just then Lucius Vorenus, following Pullo from the fortifications, reached the site of the mêlée and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. After slaying one of the enemy and driving back the rest, Vorenus lost his footing on the irregular terrain. As the Nervii drew closer to him, Pullo came to his rescue. After slaying many of their opponents, the two retreated to the fortifications amidst roaring applause from their comrades.

Titus Pullo

Titus Pullo was one of the two Roman centurions of the 11th Legion (Legio XI Claudia) mentioned in the writings of Julius Caesar. The other soldier mentioned was Lucius Vorenus; they appear in Caesar's "Commentarii de Bello Gallico," Book 5, Chapter 44.
Pullo and Vorenus were fierce rivals for promotion to "primus pilus", the most senior centurion in a legion. Both distinguished themselves in 54 BC when the Nervii attacked the legion under Quintus Cicero in their winter quarters in Nervian territory. In an effort to outdo Vorenus, Pullo charged out of the fortified camp and attacked the enemy, but was soon wounded and surrounded. Vorenus followed and engaged his attackers in hand-to-hand combat, killing one and driving the rest back, but lost his footing and was himself soon surrounded. Pullo in turn rescued Vorenus, and after killing several of the enemy, the pair returned to camp amid applause from their comrades.
In the Civil War of 49 BC, Pullo was assigned to the XXIV Victrix Rapax, a new Italian legion commanded by the legate Gaius Antonius. In 48 BC, Antonius was blockaded on an island and forced to surrender; Pullo was apparently responsible for most of his soldiers switching sides to fight for Pompey. Later that year, he is recorded bravely defending Pompey's camp in Greece from Caesar's attack shortly before the Battle of Pharsalus.

The Franchise (novel)

The Franchise is a 1983 book written by former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver/tight end Peter Gent.
The book follows a cynical college football quarterback's rise to superstardom in the professional ranks with a corrupt expansion team, whom he leads to a championship. While it shared some of the themes of Gent's 1973 novel, "North Dallas Forty", "The Franchise" adds political corruption and murder.
Plot summary.
Taylor Rusk is a star college quarterback and a can't-miss prospect in The League. Through various illegal means, North Texas is awarded an expansion franchise. As expected, the expansion Texas Pistols draft Rusk number one. The Pistols have a five-year plan to turn the team into champions, and getting Taylor Rusk ready is the key. But Rusk is on to the corruption and refuses to be a victim. With his college coach at the helm and "old league" legends mentoring him, Taylor Rusk plays The League's game until it's time for him to make his most daring move to bring it down.
But along the way, Rusk is betrayed. One teammate, a chronic con man, becomes the Pistols' general manager and ultimately betrays him. Another teammate suffers a devastating knee injury. However, the surgery is botched. Rusk sees him get tossed aside and, due largely to steroid abuse, he murders his family and commits suicide.
Five years later, the Texas Pistols are world champions, but Taylor Rusk has little time to celebrate. He's got to save the life of another victim: the woman he's fallen in love with — who's also the mother of his son. They ultimately take control of the Texas Pistols for him.

Kenji Sawada

As a singer (often he also worked as a songwriter) and actor, Sawada prospered greatly on Japanese popular culture in the last three decades of the Showa era. At the end of the 1960s, he had great success as the lead singer of the band The Tigers. After the breakup of The Tigers and another project PYG, he began his own solo career.
Music career.
Sawada was the lead singer of the best-known J-pop music act of the late 1960s Group Sounds era band The Tigers. A national teen idol, his nickname is Julie. Japanese pop stars of that era often adopted nicknames, particularly often English-language girls' names. His nickname is derived from the actress Julie Andrews as he is a fan of hers. The group was signed by Watanabe Productions.
In 1968, Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees was commissioned to compose two songs for the band in an attempt at international success. One of the songs was a hit in Japan, titled "Smile for Me" and sung by Sawada. In spite of his clear English pronunciation, the record did not make the pop charts in foreign markets as the Watanabe Productions management team had hoped. The band disbanded shortly after its release.
In 1970, after The Tigers broke up, Sawada formed the supergroup, "PYG". Kenichi Hagiwara, Sawada's main rival in the Group Sounds era, was a co-lead vocalist. When PYG disbanded, Sawada went solo, but acting was to be his main form of artistic expression after that. Sawada started to wear trendy clothes and make-up in the 1970s, and became regarded as an influential fashion innovator.
Sawada also plays the shamisen. He appeared on the cover of "Rolling Stone" in March 1969 (No. 28), and is the only Japanese as a cover person of this magazine other than Yoko Ono.
Film career.
Sawada's best-known roles include playing in Paul Schrader's biopic movie about Yukio Mishima, "Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters" and playing in Takashi Miike's horror-comedy musical "The Happiness of the Katakuris".

NER Class C1

The North Eastern Railway (NER) Class C1, was a class of 0-6-0 freight locomotives designed by T.W. Worsdell. They were used throughout the NER system, although particularly in Teesside between 1886 and 1962.
History.
Thirty examples were built at Gateshead between 1886 and 1894, but after 1900 171 examples of the similar Class C compound locomotives were converted to simple operation and added to the class. The whole class was then re-designated as Class C and were numbered between 16 and 1820. 
All 201 of the class passed into the London and North Eastern Railway ownership in 1923, and they were classified J21 but without any sub-classes to reflect the different backgrounds or dimensions. The class retained their original North Eastern Railway numbers under the 1924 renumbering scheme. Withdrawal of the class began in 1929, but proceeded relatively slowly and there were still substantial numbers in service in 1943 when the survivors were renumbered between 5025 and 5123' (with gaps).
Eighty-two surviving examples passed into British Railways (BR) ownership in 1948, and renumbered by adding 60000 to their exiting numbers. These were gradually withdrawn from service over the next fourteen years.
Rebuilding.
The mechanical history of the class is very complex, and both Wilson Worsdell and Vincent Raven made changes to the class. All the Class C compounds were rebuilt as Class C1 simple. Many examples were later rebuilt with a superheater and others had the original Joy valve gear replaced with piston valves and Stephenson valve gear. Some locos were further rebuilt with superheaters, 19" bore cylinders, piston valves and Stephenson valve gear. The superheaters were later removed from some of these locomotives.
Preservation.
One example, (then numbered 876) was withdrawn in November 1939, but as a result of the onset of war was subsequently repaired and re-instated. It survived as BR 65033 until 1962. The Locomotive was preserved in 1972 for Beamish Museum. It was used from 1975, pulling the restored NER Coach and the restored NER wagons between the Colliery Sidings and Station, until 1984 when it was declared unfit to run due to the Boiler certificate running out it last ran in December 1983. It then languished in the station yard, with No 14 (Hawthorn Leslie) or the Diesel shunter moving it to keep the motion from seizing up on occasion. It was on static display until 2004/2005 when it was removed to the North Norfolk Railway for restoration to steam in 2007. It is currently preserved in working order at National Railway Museum Shildon.

Taman Mini Indonesia Indah

Taman Mini Indonesia Indah (TMII) or "Beautiful Indonesia Miniature Park" (literally translated) is a culture-based recreational area located in East Jakarta, Indonesia. It has an area of about . The park is a synopsis of Indonesian culture, with virtually all aspects of daily life in Indonesia's 26 (in 1975) provinces encapsulated in separate pavilions with the collections of Indonesian architecture, clothing, dances and traditions are all depicted impeccably. Apart from that, there is a lake with a miniature of the archipelago in the middle of it, cable cars, museums, Keong Emas Imax cinema, a theater called the Theatre of My Homeland ("Theater Tanah Airku") and other recreational facilities which make TMII one of the most popular tourist destinations in the city.
Since 2007 Taman Mini Indonesia Indah launched new logo with branding slogan "Pesona Indonesia" ("Indonesian Charm").
History.
The idea of presenting Indonesia in a small scale was conceived by former Indonesian first lady, Siti Hartinah, better known as Tien Suharto. It came about at a convention on 8 Cendana Street at March 13, 1970. Through this recreational site, she hoped to cultivate national pride in more Indonesian people. A project called "Indonesian Miniature Project" was started by Harapan Kita Foundation in 1972. The concept of this culture-based recreational area was inspired by Indonesia's unparalled natural riches and local folk diversity.
Characteristics.
TMII was originally located on a public area of 145 ha, as farms and fields. Later, the team was able to convert these fields into a suitable location for the construction. The topography of TMII is rather hilly, consistent with what the builders required. The team claimed the advantage of utilizing this uneven terrain was the ability to create interesting and diverse landscapes and enclosures, as well as reflecting the various characteristics of the Indonesian environment.
Parts of TMII.
Venues of Indonesian Provinces.
Since each Indonesian province maintains its own unique and distinct cultures, shelters, attire and dialects, TMII built a model of each of the houses from Indonesian provinces. TMII attempted not only to reconstruct the homes of the various provinces, but also to create a realistic model of the environment and shelters of the various people of Indonesia. The venues, which are situated around the main lake in a similar fashion to the different islands of the Indonesian archipelago, are thematically divided into six areas in respect to the main islands of Indonesia; Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan (Borneo), Sulawesi, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku and Papua. Each pavilions featured in typical vernacular Indonesian architecture of each provinces. Examples of Indonesian traditional vernacular houses are: Joglo and Omah Kudus Javanese houses of Central Java and Yogyakarta pavilion; Minang Rumah Gadang of West Sumatra pavilion; Malay houses of Jambi and Riau provinces; Torajan Tongkonan and Bugis house of South Sulawesi pavilion; and Balinese house compound with intricately carved Candi Bentar split gate and Kori Agung gate.
It also displays various traditional costumes, wedding costumes, dance costumes, also ethnography artifacts such as weapons and daily tools, models of traditional architecture are in display to describes the way of life of its people. Each provinces pavilions also equipped with small stage, amphitheatre or auditorium for traditional dance performances, traditional music performances or traditional ceremonies that usually held in Sundays. Some of these pavilions also equipped with cafeterias featuring traditional Indonesian cuisines and also souvenir shops offering various handicrafts, t-shirts and souvenirs.
Since 1975 until the 2000s, the original design of TMII consist of a model of the houses from the 27 provinces of Indonesia, including East Timor. But after the secession of East Timor from Indonesia in 2002, the East Timor pavilion changed its status to become the Museum of East Timor. Also since Indonesia now consist of 33 provinces, currently the new province pavilions of Bangka Belitung, Banten, West Sulawesi, North Maluku, Gorontalo, and West Papua is being built in northeast part of the park.
After the recognition of Indonesian Chinese culture as the integral part of Indonesian culture in 2000, the new Indonesian Chinese pavilion and a Confucian temple was built within the park.
Religious Buildings.
The religious buildings of several official faiths is meant to showcase the inter-faiths tolerance and religious harmony of Indonesia. The religious buildings are:
Gardens and Parks.
There are about ten gardens spread within TMII complex, but most are located primarily on the north and northeast side of the main lake:
Technological Centre.
Pusat peragaan Iptek or Science and Technology Display Centre is under coordination of Research and Technology Ministry. At the end of 2011 has 15 sites with about 300 science tools and visited by 341,000 visitor in a year. The sites are Robotic, Electric and Magnet, Mechanics, Mathematics, etc.
Museums.
There are fourteen museums at TMII:
Plans.
At 2011 the operator plans to disburse $35 million for building a new Discovery World theme park. A 2 hectares area will be build since October 2011 and predicted will be operated before end of 2012. It will serves 100 venues/rides and is predicted attracts 1.2 million visitors from Indonesia and Southeast Asia.

Globe of Frogs

Globe of Frogs is an album released by Robyn Hitchcock and The Egyptians on A&M Records in 1988. Made in London, it was recorded by the Egyptians (Robyn Hitchcock, Andy Metcalfe, and Morris Windsor) along with Pat Collier, and emerged as the group's debut after signing to major label A&M.
The album is densely produced, most of the tracks shying away from the group's signature electric guitar sound. Several feature surreal lyrics; the title track a case in point with its depiction of conscious floorboards groaning in pain and excited fish flipping in delight in their ponds.
Other titles include one of Hitchcock's best known songs, the minor college radio hit "Balloon Man" in which its central character explodes in the street, spattering passers by with remains of half-digested food. The single reached #1 on Gavin Report's Alternative music chart.
"Unsettled" is also note-worthy for Hitchcock, being his first attempt at a lyric with no inherent meaning, a string of randomised words constructed for their aural quality as opposed to logical meaning.
"Chinese Bones" has proved perhaps the most durable from the album, becoming one of Hitchcock's more frequently performed concert numbers.
The album was packaged in dark green, with one of Hitchcock's paintings on the front. The sleeve notes consist of his 'manifesto' in which Hitchcock advocates 'the organic' as opposed to the big business of 'insanity' and implores listeners to bury their televisions:
"All of us exist in a swarming, pulsating world, driven mostly by an unconscious that we ignore and misunderstand. Within the framework of „civilisation” we remain as savage as possible. Against the dense traffic of modern life, we fortify our animal selves with video violence, imaginary sex, and music…but our inflamed and disoriented psyches smoulder on beneath the wet leaves of habit."
Guest artists included Chris Cox, Peter Buck (from R.E.M.), and Glenn Tilbrook.

Acacia xiphophylla

Acacia xiphophylla, commonly known as snakewood or snake-wood, is a tree in the family Fabaceae. Endemic to Western Australia, it occurs on saline semi-arid land in the Gascoyne River and Ashburton catchments east and north of Carnarvon.
Snakewood grows as a spreading tree, usually with two or three main trunks. It can grow up to five metres high and eight metres wide. Like most "Acacia" species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. These are bluish grey in colour, and may be up to eight centimetres long and eight millimetres wide. The flowers are yellow, and held in cylindrical clusters about three centimetres long. The pods are up to twelve centimetres long and eight millimetres wide, and have constrictions between the seeds.
The wood of other trees with wavy grain or wavy coloration has also been called snakewood.

Of poor health as a child, she was unable to attend classes in school on a regular basis, so her father decided to keep her at home. She was taught English, French and Chinese literature through private tutors. She was also strongly influenced by her paternal grandmother, who introduced her to the Japanese classics such as "The Tale of Genji", as well as to Edo period "gesaku" novels and to the "kabuki" and "bunraku" theater. A precocious child, at age 13, her reading list included the works of Oscar Wilde, Edgar Allan Poe, Kyōka Izumi, Nagai Kafū, Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, and especially Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, whose sado-masochistic aestheticism particularly fascinated her.
From 1918 to 1922, she attended the girl's middle school of Japan Women's University, but was forced to abandon her studies due to health. However, her interest in the theatre was encouraged by her father, and as a young woman, she attended the lectures of Kaoru Osanai, the founder of modern Japanese drama.
Her literary career began in 1926, with a one-act stage play published in the literary journal "Kabuki", which was well received by critics, who noted her sympathies with the proletarian literature movement. This was followed in 1928 by "A Noisy Night in Late Spring" ("Banshun Soya"), which was performed at the Tsukiji Little Theatre.
In 1930, she married Yoshimatsu Enchi, a journalist with the "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun," with whom she had a daughter. She then began to write fiction but unlike her smooth debut as a playwright, she found it very hard to get her stories published. Although from 1939, the "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" began publishing a serialization of her translation of the "Genji Monogatari" into modern Japanese language, her early novels, such as "The World Like the Wind" ("Kaze no gotoki kotoba", 1939), the "The Treasures of Heaven and Sea" ("Ten no sachi, umi no sachi", 1940) and "Spring and Autumn" ("Shunju", 1943) were not a commercial success. She also continued to struggle with her health, having a mastectomy in 1938 after being diagnosed with uterine cancer, and suffering from post-surgical complications.
In 1945, Enchi's home and all her possessions burned during one of the air raids on Tokyo towards the end of the Pacific War. She had a hysterectomy in 1946, and stopped writing to around 1951.
Postwar success.
In 1953, Enchi’s novel was received favorably by critics. Her novel is a violent, harrowing tale of family misfortune and physical and emotional deprivation, based partly on wartime personal experiences, and in 1954 won the Women’s Literature Prize.
Enchi’s next novel was also highly praised: (1949–1957) won the Noma Literary Prize. The novel is set in the Meiji period and analyzes the plight of women who have no alternative but to accept the demeaning role assigned to them in the patriarchal social order. The protagonist is the wife of a government official, who is humiliated when her husband not only takes concubines, but has them live under the same roof as both maids and as secondary wives.
From the 1950s and 1960s, Enchi became quite successful, and wrote numerous novels and short stories exploring female psychology and sexuality. In "Masks" ("Onna men", 1958), her protagonist is based on Lady Rokujo from the "Genji Monogatari", depicted as shamanist character. After losing her son in a climbing accident on Mount Fuji, she manipulates her widowed daughter-in-law to have a son by any means to replace the one she lost.
The theme of a shamanist appears repeatedly in Enchi’s works in the 1960s. Enchi contrasted the traditions of female subjugation in Buddhism with the role of the shamaness in the indigenous Japanese Shinto religion, and used this as a means to depict the shamaness as a vehicle for either retribution against men, or empowerment for women. In "The Tale of An Enchantress" ("Nama miko monogatari", 1965), she sets the story in the Heian period, with the protagonist as Empress Teishi (historical figure Fujiwara no Teishi, also known as Sadako), a consort of Emperor Ichijo. The novel won the 1966 Women’s Literature Prize.
In "A Tale of False Oracles" (1969-1970), Enchi writes of female mediums and possession by spirits.
Three of her stories were selected for the Tanizaki Prize in 1969: "Shu wo ubau mono; Kizu aru tsubasa; Niji to shura" (朱を奪うもの/傷ある翼/虹と修羅).
Another theme in Enchi’s writing is eroticism in aging women, which she saw as a biological inequality between men and women. In “Growing Fog” ("Saimu", 1976), an aging woman becomes obsessed with a fantasy in which she can revitalize herself through sexual liaisons with young men.
Later life.
Enchi was made a Person of Cultural Merit in 1979, and was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government in 1985. She was elected to the Japan Art Academy shortly before her death on November 14, 1986, of a heart attack, suffered while she was at a family event in 1986 at her home in the Yanaka neighborhood of Tokyo. Her grave is at the nearby Yanaka Cemetery. Few of Enchi's works have been translated out of Japanese.

Dumpy's Rusty Nuts

Dumpy's Rusty Nuts are a British rock band founded in 1981 by the lead singer Graham "Dumpy" Dunnell. Though unsuccessful as recording artists the band have been a successful and popular live act for decades. The band attracted a cult following for their outstanding live performances in small rock venues. Playing classic blues rock, their initial audiences were drawn from the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal and 'Bikers' and they become particularly well-known at the London Marquee Club, where they were a regular and popular attraction. In the early to mid-1980s the band toured extensively around the UK playing at small rock/'Biker' pub and club venues including the Isle of Man TT, and music festivals, cementing their name and following.
The band were not successful recording artists, preferring to concentrate on live work. They released a debut single "Just For Kicks" in June 1982 but in order to get airplay the band had to change their name to "Dumpy's Rusty Bolts". Sales of the single were poor, and the original band name was restored. A second single, "Box Hill Or Bust", was released. Subsequent sporadic releases have only found favour with their small core audience.
They released a double live album, "Somewhere In England", in 1984, which was recorded at the Marquee Club.
Despite the group's longevity, they became for a time a favourite target for mockery from the British music press, especially "Melody Maker", where their name was often invoked as the epitome of failure in the music business in the humorous section "Talk Talk Talk" written by David Stubbs.
As of 2010, the band is still performing in small venues, music festivals and bike rallies across Europe. The band has toured with and supported many bands including Hawkwind, Motörhead and Status Quo.

Slender-billed kite

The slender-billed kite ("Helicolestes hamatus") is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes the eagles, hawks and Old World vultures. It is found near water in forested parts of tropical northern and central South America, and far eastern Panama. Both genders resemble the male snail kite, and the slender-billed kite has often been included in the same genus, "Rostrhamus". Adults always have yellow eyes and the all-dark tail is noticeably shorter than in the snail kite. Immatures resemble adults, but have brownish eyes and three (incl. tip) narrow white bands in the tail. As in the snail kite, the unusually shaped bill is an adaption for feeding on aquatic snails, and while it sometimes takes crabs, it mainly feeds on snails of the genus "Pomacea".

Hook-billed kite

The Hook-billed Kite ("Chondrohierax uncinatus"), is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, eagles, and harriers. It occurs in the Americas, including the Rio Grande Valley of Texas in the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and tropical South America.
It is a mid-sized, slender raptor with an invariably striped belly and banded tail but there is probably more individual variation in color and in size of bill than in any other species of diurnal raptor. Birds from beneath can look blackish or gray (especially males) and brown or brick-red (females) variously. This renders species identification at times extremely difficult. The downcurved hook at the tip of the beak is apparent on perched and low-flying birds. Weight can range from 215 to 397 grams (7.6-14 oz.) and length is 38–51 cm (15–20 in).
Tree snails are this raptor's favorite prey but frogs, salamanders, small mammals and insects are also taken. When it finds a tree snail it holds it with its talon and uses its beak to pry open the shell. The nest is a flimsy platform of sticks is built by both sexes. The Hook-billed Kite lays two to three buff-white eggs marked with red-brown. Incubation is by both sexes. Semialtricial young stay in the nest 35–45 days and are fed by both sexes. This raptor is often considered sluggish and retiring, preferring to perch inside leafy canopy when not flying.
The critically endangered Cuban Kite, "C. wilsonii", is considered by some authors to be a subspecies of the Hook-billed Kite.

The Golden Cups

Career.
The band formed in November 1966 in Yokohama, and initially comprised locally born singer Tokimune "Dave" Hirao (November 17, 1944–November 10, 2008), guitarist Eddie Ban (born June 22, 1947), Hawaiian-born guitarist Kenneth Ito (January 1, 1946–March 2, 1997), bassist Masayoshi "Louis" Kabe (born November 5, 1948), and drummer Mamoru Manu (born June 3, 1949).
Hirao had previously sung in local band The Sphinx, and had recently traveled to the US, as had Ban who returned to Japan with one of the first fuzzboxes in the country. The new band initially called themselves Group & I, and were influenced by the rock and roll music broadcast on the Far East Network from the local US Army base at Honmoku, and more generally by contacts made with Americans and others in the port city of Yokohama.
They began playing sets consisting of covers of American pop and rock hits such as "Hey Joe", "Got My Mojo Workin'" and "I Feel Good". They became the house band at the Golden Cup discotheque close to the US Army base, and the club's owner persuaded them to change their name to the Golden Cups. The band also soon won a regular place on the NHK-TV morning show, "Young 720", and a recording deal with the Capital label owned by Toshiba. In June 1967, they released their first single, "Itoshi No Jizabel" / "Hiwa Mata Noboru". The record label compelled the group to record bland pop songs written by staff songwriters for most of their A-sides, only allowing them free rein on the records' B-sides and some album tracks. The same approach was imposed on their performances, with the band obliged to play pop ballads at their major concerts, while playing eccentric garage band covers and hard rock when appearing in small clubs. They released their first album, "The Golden Cups Album", in March 1968, and had their biggest pop hit, "Nagai Kami No Shoujo" ("Girl With Long Hair") soon afterwards.
Kenneth Ito traveled to Hawaii in mid-1968, and was not allowed a visa to return to Japan. He was replaced by keyboard player Mickey Yoshino, in time to record the band's second album "The Golden Cups Album Vol. 2". This again featured covers of American pop hits like "Woman, Woman" alongside more adventurous numbers, producing what Julian Cope has called "a schizophrenic stalemate". Their next album was a live recording, "Blues Message", on which the band performed versions of most of the tracks on the Paul Butterfield Blues Band's album "East-West".
In 1969, Eddie Ban left the group to form his own band, and Louis Kabe took over on guitar. Later albums included "Super Live Session", heavily influenced by the album "Super Session" by Al Kooper and Mike Bloomfield; "Recital", which featured orchestral versions of some of the group's hits; and "Live Album with the Golden Cups", described by Julian Cope as "abominable". During this period the band underwent many personnel changes, with only Hirao and Kabe remaining constant. On New Years Eve 1971/72, the band were playing in a club in Okinawa when the building caught fire and burned to the ground, taking all of the band's equipment and possessions with it. Although the group members were unharmed, they split up immediately afterwards.
Aftermath.
Louis Kabe later led the band Speed, Glue and Shinki, and was then a member of rock band Pink Cloud. Kenneth Ito died in 1997. In 2003, most of the band's original members reunited for a concert in Yokohama, released as a live album. A full-length documentary about the band, "The Golden Cups One More Time", was released in late 2004 and was followed by further concerts.
Dave Hirao died as a result of oesophageal cancer in 2008 at the age of 63.

Trammell Crow

Fred Trammell Crow (June 10, 1914 – January 14, 2009) was an American real estate developer from Dallas, Texas. He is credited with the creation of several major real estate projects, including the Dallas Market Center, Peachtree Center in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, California.
Biography.
A native of Dallas, Crow as a child and later as an adolescent earned money through a series of odd jobs, including plucking chickens, cleaning bricks, and unloading boxcars, a task which he began at the age of ten until his father forbade it. He was the fifth of eight children reared in a rented one-bedroom house off Fitzhugh Street in East Dallas. His father, Jefferson Crow, worked as a bookkeeper for Collett Munger – one of Dallas' early real estate developers and the builder of Munger Place subdivision. Unable to attend college at the time because of the Great Depression, Crow worked after high school at odd jobs. In 1933, Crow landed a job for about $13 a week as a runner for Mercantile National Bank in Dallas.
After completing Woodrow Wilson High School in 1932, he worked for a Dallas bank and attended night school in accounting at Southern Methodist University. Upon graduation in 1938, he was at the age of twenty-four the youngest CPA in Texas. He then worked for three years as a Certified Public Accountant before joining the United States Navy in 1940. He utilized his background in accounting and was offered a commission auditing the books of defense contractors. After World War II, he remained with the Navy for another year to handle final settlements with its contractors. He then returned to Dallas and saw opportunities for the growth of the city. He became an agent for North American Van Lines, a moving company. Shortly thereafter, he worked as a wholesale grain merchandiser, tripled the sizes of the warehouses, and erected new loading facilities. Once the grain business faded, he switched at the age of thirty-three to the burgeoning field of warehouse real estate development.
Crow built his first warehouse in 1948 and leased it to Ray-O-Vac Battery Company. The warehouse was larger than what Ray-O-Vac needed, and Crow was able to seek additional tenants. He convinced Decca Records to sign for the leftover space, and began a career as a "speculative builder." This field was a new concept in property development, one in which builders typically designed construction to meet the expressed needs of one specific company, then leased the entire space to that company after the building was in place.
He continued from his start with a single-story warehouse on the banks of the Trinity River in the late 1940s. In partnerships with John M. Stemmons, he became one of the largest developers in the Trinity River Industrial Park. By the middle 1950s, Crow was Dallas' largest warehouse builder.
His company's skyscrapers – including Dallas' 50-story Trammell Crow Center and the 53-story Chase Tower – reshaped skylines in the 1980s in cities stretching from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Atlanta, San Francisco and San Diego, California.
Trammell Crow Company.
By 1970, Crow had developed Trammell Crow Company into a nationwide organization, another innovation in a field that was, at the time, dominated strictly by local builders.
Forbes in 1971 and "The Wall Street Journal" in 1986 called Crow the largest landlord in the United States. "The Journal" said the company he founded was then the largest developer in the nation.
Crow once had interests in nearly of developed real estate, comprising eight thousand properties in more than one hundred cities. Crow's holdings were said to be much larger than those of the better-known William Zeckendorf and Donald Trump and include hotels, hospitals, residential developments, and — just as in the early days of the company — warehouses. The "Austin Business Journal" said in its profile of TCC, "When compared to Trammell Crow, other real estate companies are for the birds." Yahoo! Finance, in an oddly similar metaphor, said in its company profile: "It takes a tough bird to succeed in the real estate business, and Trammell Crow Company is one of the cocks of the walk." Calling the organization "one of the top diversified real estate management companies in the US," the profile estimates that the company manages nearly of warehouse, service center, and retail space in the United States and Canada. 
As of June, 2007, the company was set to grow even further with the scheduled $60 million purchase of the HealthSouth headquarters building in Birmingham, Alabama.
The Trammell Crow Company was privately held until 1997, when it went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol TCC. In 2006, the firm was sold to CB Richard Ellis group (NYSE:CBG) for approximately $2.2 billion.
Art collection.
Trammell Crow was an enthusiastic collector of East Asian art. His son, Trammell S. Crow, went to Yale University with Alex Kerr, and some time later, after Kerr was more established, he became an art purchaser in Tokyo for the Trammell Crow Company at the behest of his father.
Personal.
In 1989, Crow was an original inductee of the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame, which was established in connection with the school's sixtieth anniversary.
Crow was instrumental in bringing to Dallas the 1984 Republican National Convention, which renominated U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan and Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush. He and his wife, the former Margaret Doggett, were avid collectors of Asian art, for which they established a museum, The Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art. This private museum, is open to the public without charge. It is located on Flora Street in the Arts District of downtown Dallas. 
At the time of his death, Crow was married to his wife of sixty-six years. The couple has six surviving children: Lucy C. Billingsley, Robert Crow, Harlan Crow, Howard Crow, Stuart Crow, and Trammell S. Crow. The Crows have sixteen grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Late in life, Crow began suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Crow died in his sleep at his ranch near Tyler in East Texas on January 14, 2009. He is interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas.

In Matanga's discussion of musical scales and micro-tonal intervals he clarifies Bharata Muni's Natya Shastra on which the author based his work. It clarifies many issues related to shruti that were presented tersely by Bharata.
The text of Brihaddeshi was edited by the Prem Lata Sharma for the Indira Kalakendra series of original texts on the Indian arts and was published as a book "Matanga and His Work Brihaddesi" in 2001 . Dwaram Bhavanarayana Rao published a Telugu translation and paraphrase in 2002.

Music video.
The video was filmed on location in New Orleans and cost around $500,000 US. According to the Scatman, "the day we shot the video was a day beyond all boundaries of time and space. Full of magic. All of the images together created the perfect atmosphere for showing the heart and soul of Louis Armstrong's roots". In the video Scatman, walking across a parking lot, sees the ghost of Louis Armstrong on the side of a building and the pair begin to duet. The bulk of the video takes place in a Louisiana street parade with Scatman and Louis riding along behind a marching band in a cadillac. Several children dressed up like Scatman are in the procession whilst onlookers wave Scatman and Louis flags. The video ends with Scatman looking up at Louis in the parking lot where it started.

Charles Kline (December 25, 1870 – July 22, 1933), served as the 47th Mayor of Pittsburgh from 1926 to 1933.
Early life.
Mayor Kline was born in 1870 in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. Before taking the helm of the Pittsburgh's Mayor's Office Kline was a State Representative and in 1906 was elected to the State Senate.
Pittsburgh politics.
During Kline's administration the city was plunged into the national Great Depression. Despite these newfound hardships, Pittsburgh's corporate community continued to expand, adding several new skyscrapers to the region's horizon.

Joe E. Hollingsworth

Joseph E. Hollingsworth (1908–1975), who went by Joe E. Hollingsworth, was appointed in 1961 to replace Charles Navarro as Los Angeles City Council member for the racially mixed 10th district. He served for two years until he was ousted by retired policeman and future mayor Tom Bradley. He was the last Caucasian council member from that district.
Biography.
Hollingsworth, born on August 25, 1908, was the son of Anna Hollingsworth Bostic, who immigrated from Germany. A native of Los Angeles, he lived with his family at 5483 Village Green and was "active in youth work"; in 1961 he was a construction supervisor for the Baldwin Hills Company, developer of Baldwin Hills Estates. His wife was Alice and his children were Joe Jr. and Alison. In 1969 he was named a vice president of Los Angeles Federal Savings. He was a veteran of World War II and co-founded Baldwin Hills Post 706 of the American Legion. He co-founded the Southern California Pop Warner Football Federation.
Hollingsworth died November 12, 1975; funeral services were held in Inglewood on November 15.
Political career.
"See also List of Los Angeles Municipal Election Returns, 1963."
In June 1961 Hollingsworth and 10 other people applied for the 10th District councilmanic position left vacant by the election of the incumbent, Charles Navarro, as city controller. Eventually there were more than 30 candidates. Although Mayor Sam Yorty had favored appointment of a Negro in the district, a council committee unanimously recommended 52-year-old Hollingsworth, a Caucasian, and the City Council followed suit on August 25, 1961, by a vote of 8 to 6, "after a stormy 2-1/2-hour council session."
One of his first acts was to appoint Cage S. Johnson, 49, a "restaurant service supervisor and part-time television actor," as the "first Negro to serve as field secretary to a City Council member," but nevertheless a recall drive was organized at a community meeting, with H.H. Brookins named as chair. Brookins said that 16 applicants for city councilman were Negroes and that the council, by appointing Hollingsworth, "had dealt the Negro community a fast shuffle." The recall petitions were rejected by a court "because they failed to list the voter registration number and the date of registration of the persons who circulated them."
At the next election, in April 1963, there were only two candidates, Hollingsworth and Tom Bradley, and also two elections — one for the unexpired term left by Controller Navarro, ending June 30, and one for a full four-year term starting July 1. Bradley won by 17,760 votes to 10,540 in the first election and by 17,552 votes to 10,400 in the second. Hollingsworth's last day in office was April 12, 1963. He was the last Caucasian council member from the 10th District.

Great Timor

Great Timor () refers to the irredentist concept of a united and independent island of Timor, covering formerly Portuguese East Timor, and formerly Dutch (now Indonesian) West Timor. 
East Timor was invaded and occupied by Indonesia in 1975, which annexed the territory as its "27th Province" in 1976, but in a referendum held in 1999, the people of East Timor voted to end Indonesian occupation and become an independent state. This caused widespread anger among many Indonesian nationalists, particularly in the military.
In 2001 and 2002, before East Timor's independence, there were claims by the Indonesian military and some commentators, that this would inspire the secession of West Timor from Indonesia. There is not a single Timorese source about that supposed "Great Timor" movement.
However, there is no real evidence whatsoever that the people of West Timor, most of whom are from Atoni ethnicity who are the traditional enemy of East Timorese, have any interest in joining their tribal enemies. Additionally, East Timor's independence movement never laid claim to West Timor at any time, before the Indonesian invasion or thereafter. Similarly, the government of East Timor fully recognises Indonesia's existing boundaries as inherited from the Netherlands East Indies. This is similar to the position taken by Papua New Guinea in relation to Papua and West Papua in Indonesia, when Papua New Guinea became independent of Australia.

William A. Magee

William Anderson Magee (1873–1938) was born in Pittsburgh's Hill District neighborhood the site of the present day Mellon Arena and the region's hub for African American culture. Before becoming mayor he gained his reputation by serving as Assistant District Attorney for Allegheny County of which Pittsburgh is the County Seat. He twice served as Mayor of Pittsburgh, from 1909 to 1914, and again from 1922 to 1926. He was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate from 1901 to 1904.
Pittsburgh politics.
Magee oversaw several developments in the city, the most notable of which were the opening of the first National League concrete baseball park Forbes Field in the city's Oakland neighborhood. To top that achievement the Pittsburgh Pirates won their first World Series in their first season in the park.
On policy the Magee administration instituted a motorized police force for the first time in the city. He also oversaw the local institution of the national prohibition laws during his second term in office. He was the first man to serve the new expanded four-year term for the Mayor's office.
Honors.
Mayor Magee lives on through both Magee-Women's Hospital and Magee Street in the city, both were named for the family and the Mayor's notable uncle, Christopher Lyman Magee.
Popular Culture.
Magee was featured in the 1924 film "Fording the Lincoln Highway".
Magee also wrote an informative article about what he considered to be the inefficiencies of city government. While many of the concepts he addresses seem logical, at the time of publication many local governments were run through executive checks and balances to the point of ineffectiveness. Magee wrote that city governments should be more centralized and focused to be effective.

Paul of Taganrog

The Blessed starets Saint Paul of Taganrog ( - Pavel Taganrogskiy, born Pavel Pavlovich Stoykov) dramatically influenced the belief in God and spiritual outlook of inhabitants of Taganrog, Don Land, South of Russia and Ukraine. A plain layman, who lived in Taganrog in the 19th century, he conciliated love and worship of Russian Orthodox Christians, who flowed to him for a piece of advice and spiritual support.
Pavel Pavlovich Stoykov was born on November 21 (November 8 OS), 1792 in Malorossia guberniya of the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) in a rich noble family. His parents – collegiate registrar Pavel and Paraskeva – were devoutly religious people, they infused in the heart of their son belief in God and piety. Since his youth Pavel had felt a flaming love for holy places and pilgrimage. He related about himself: “All my desire was to pray to God, my intention was to go on pilgrimage to rescue my soul, because surrounding life was full of secular vanity and impeded my holy wish”. His father would never let him become a clergyman; he wanted to provide his son with a higher education. Instead of this, the 16-year-old young man followed the voice of his heart, secretly left the home of his parents and went on pilgrimages to monasteries for a year and finally received a severe punishment from his father.
When Pavel was 25 years old, his father decided to divide the property between him and his elder brother Ivan. With a comfortable inheritance, the young ascetic dispensed it in Christ's name, the father gave his blessing and young Pavel left home forever. He wandered a lot to holy places, including to Kiev Pechersk Lavra and Pochaiv Lavra Lavras that he visited several times; he liked to go to the north of Russia, visited Solovetskiy, Verkolskiy, Kojeozerskiy cloisters and many others.
After 10 years of pilgrimage, Blessed Pavel settled in Taganrog in the years 1825–1830. Taganrog became the Saint’s second home city, where he lived a simple life with no regard for his noble birth. Blessed Pavel spent the first years of his life in Taganrog renting different flats. Later, he moved into a house on Depaldo Street (now "Pereulok Turgenevskiy"), not far from the Saint Nicholas Church. Thanks to the dean of Taganrog county, archpriest Alexander Klyunkov, this house still exists and is known among people as the “keliya of starets Pavel”.
Pavel devoted all of his life to serving God. Although Pavel was not in orders, essentially he led an ascetic monastic life in a bustling town; he kept constantly a severe fast and gave himself to incessant prayers. He ate a little. In his old age he drank only one cup of kvass with a soaked rusk a day. He slept also a little, commonly on the bare bench without a pillow. He put on plain peasant clothes and spoke simple Low-Russian language. He told nobody about his noble birth. During all his life he went to pray to the church every day, at night he made all-night prayerful vigils. Insensibly he accustomed his novices to this way of life. While there was the strength Blessed Paul often traveled to holy places, including journeys of 3000 versts on foot to Solovki more than once. But by old age he could go no longer, he dispatched to monasteries his novices and believers, who came to him.
Blessed Pavel was a preceptor full of love. All of his life, he received everyone in his keliya, liked to present people with gifts, to treat them, gave counsels on how to live and to rescue their own souls. For the righteous life God endowed Paul with gifts of astuteness and prevision, with gifts to work miracles and to heal people. Pavel became very famous during his lifetime. In the five final years of his life, Blessed Pavel never went out of his house, ate and slept little at all. The Blessed Pavel died on 23rd (10th) of March 1879 at the time of the Great Fast (Lent) at the age of 78.
On 20 June 1999 the Russian Orthodox Church canonized Blessed Pavel. Many people saw and remember a unique aureole in the sky over the Saint Nicholas Church in Taganrog on the day of Blessed Pavel’s canonization. Today many people come from all corners of Russia to the shrine with his holy relics, which are kept at the Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker Church (1778) in Taganrog. The chapel at the old cemetery is never empty; the lamps in front of holy icons in his keliya never die down. Thanks to Saint Pavel's prayers, believers receive from God healing, consolation and divine help.

Rashad Evans

Rashad Anton Evans (born September 25, 1979) is an American mixed martial artist from Niagara Falls, New York, signed to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Evans was the Heavyweight winner of "The Ultimate Fighter 2". As of January 17, 2014, he is #3 in official UFC light heavyweight rankings and ranked the #3 light heavyweight in the world by Sherdog.
Wrestling career.
Wrestling out of Niagara-Wheatfield High School in Sanborn, New York, Evans twice made it to the state finals tournament of New York by winning his weight class for his county, in which he received All-State honors both times. In 1997 he placed 4th in the state at 145 pounds. In 1998 he placed 4th in the state at 171 pounds. In 1999 he entered the National Junior College Athletic Association National Championships for the 165 pound weight class in which he finished in 4th place. Competing once again at this tournament in 2000, he was the champion of the 165 pound weight class.
Moving on to the NCAA Division 1 wrestling, Evans competed for Michigan State, in the Big Ten conference. In 2002 he finished in 4th place in the conference championships, losing a decision to fellow future UFC competitor Jacob Volkmann in the third place match. In addition to Volkmann, this 174 pound weight class also saw more future UFC competitors with Gerald Harris and Josh Koscheck competing in it this year. In 2003, Evans again competed in the 174 pound weight class, capturing 3rd place in the Big Ten Championships. Entering the NCAA Division 1 championships on top of this 3rd place finish, Evans won his opening match before losing a close 3-0 decision to the eventual national champion, Robbie Waller. Staying alive through the consolation bracket Evans pinned his next opponent before being matched up with legend Greg Jones, a 3x National Champion who would finish his college career with a record of 126-4. Evans won the match via 3-2 decision, becoming one of only 4 people to defeat Jones in his college career. Evans lost his next match, which would have qualified him for All-American status, in a close 3-2 decision, ending his college career. He finished his career at Michigan State with a record of 48 wins and 34 losses.
Mixed martial arts.
Early career.
In 2004, under the tutelage of future UFC Hall of Famer Dan Severn, Evans competed in five professional mixed martial arts fights, winning all five. This led to his selection as one of the nine heavyweights to compete on "The Ultimate Fighter 2", a reality TV series on Spike. The season began airing on August 22, 2005, culminating in a live finale between the final two fighters of each weight division, held in Las Vegas, Nevada on November 5, 2005. Also Rashad Evans is a black belt in Gaidojutsu and BJJ, he also studied karate as a child.
The Ultimate Fighter.
At and , Evans was the shortest and the second-lightest of the nine heavyweight competitors. He was considered the underdog in each of his fights, but made it to the finals by defeating Tom Murphy, Mike Whitehead, and Keith Jardine all by decision. During his tenure on the show, Evans was criticized by opposing coach Matt Hughes for his showboating during fights, but the two eventually settled their differences, and Hughes even cornered Evans for his semifinal bout. In the finale, Evans defeated Brad Imes by split decision, thus winning a three-year, six-figure contract with the UFC and a brand new car. After "The Ultimate Fighter", Evans joined Greg Jackson's Submission Fighting camp along with fellow competitor Keith Jardine, who would eventually become his training partner and good friend.
Ultimate Fighting Championship.
Evans dropped down to light heavyweight after the show, deciding he would have a better chance of success in a lower weight class. His first fight under the contract took place on April 6, 2006 against Sam Hoger, who had been a semi-finalist on "The Ultimate Fighter 1". Evans defeated Hoger via split decision despite nearly falling victim to a kimura submission at the end of the second round.
Evans followed with a victory by majority decision over "The Ultimate Fighter 1" finalist Stephan Bonnar on June 28, 2006. Evans maintained control throughout the fight with repeated take downs, including a number of slams in the center of the cage and went on to secure the victory.
Three months later, Evans faced Jason Lambert at "UFC 63". Lambert, riding an eight-fight win streak, was seen as Evans's first real test at 205 pounds. Evans controlled the fight from early on, and knocked Lambert out with punches from the mount in the second round. It was his first stoppage victory in over two years.
Evans next headlined "" against UFC newcomer Sean Salmon, a highly decorated collegiate wrestler who held a 9–1 professional record. Though Salmon had won the first round by scoring two takedowns, Evans came back with a head kick knockout early in the second round. Salmon remained motionless for several minutes after the fight and was eventually carried out on a stretcher to a local hospital. The kick came to the surprise of many fans who had previously considered Evans a one-dimensional wrestler.
At "UFC 73", Evans squared off against former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz. The two competitors fought to a draw as all three judges scored the bout 28–28. Ortiz had won two out of three rounds on all scorecards, but was deducted a point for holding the cage fence to defend against a takedown by Evans. Immediately after the fight, Ortiz asked for a rematch. At a press conference following "UFC 73", UFC President Dana White promised a rematch, which for various reasons due to with scheduling the fight, didn't occur until 4 years later at UFC 133. 
Unable to get a rematch with Ortiz due to scheduling issues, Evans made his debut as a headliner on a pay-per-view event at "UFC 78" instead, against fellow undefeated fighter and "The Ultimate Fighter 3" winner Michael Bisping. After three close rounds, Evans came out on top on two of the judges' scorecards, winning by split decision. This fight marked Bisping's first loss and his final bout in the light heavyweight division. After his win over Bisping, Evans drastically changed his fighting style, which he kept secret until his fight against UFC Legend Chuck Liddell.
Evans vs. Liddell.
Entering the fight as a very heavy underdog, Evans shocked the world by knocking out former light heavyweight champion Chuck Liddell in brutal fashion at "UFC 88". Liddell threw an uppercut that Evans countered with an overhand right, landing flush. Liddell remained unconscious for several minutes before finally walking out of the cage under his own power. The knockout was awarded knockout of the year by Sherdog for 2008. Evans had previously been scheduled to face Liddell at "UFC 85" as a replacement for the injured Mauricio Rua. When Liddell pulled out of the event due to an injured hamstring, Evans was matched with James Irvin. When Irvin pulled out after breaking his foot, the fight was removed from the card altogether. After the fight, UFC President Dana White confirmed in the post-event press conference that Evans's next fight would be a title shot against newly crowned light heavyweight champion Forrest Griffin at "UFC 92".
Winning the Light Heavyweight Championship.
On December 27, 2008 at "UFC 92", Evans faced champion Forrest Griffin for the UFC Light Heavyweight belt. Griffin controlled most of the first two rounds with effective striking and low kicks. In the third round, however, Evans caught a low kick and countered with a straight right hand that dropped Griffin. Evans followed Griffin to the ground and eventually managed to finish the stunned champion with punches inside Griffin's guard. With the victory, Evans became the new UFC Light Heavyweight Champion. It capped off a year in which Evans won Fighter of the Year honors from Sherdog.com.
Losing the title.
Evans' first defense of the UFC Light-Heavyweight title against challenger Lyoto Machida ended in a knockout. During a flurry of punches from Machida, Evans started trash talking Machida telling him 'his hands were made of pillows'. Machida continued his onslaught, knocking the champion out. Evan's timely photograph of his face during the knockout became an infamous meme called "Shad face" amongst MMA fans. This was the first loss of his career and the 15th straight win of Lyoto Machida's career. Then, Evans went on to coach against Rampage Jackson in "". Evans was scheduled to fight Jackson on December 12, 2009, at UFC 107, but this was canceled due to Jackson being cast for the A-Team movie. On September 22, 2009, Jackson wrote in a blog on his website that he is "done fighting" because of events that occurred between Jackson and Dana White, the president of the UFC. Thiago Silva was named as Evans' next opponent at UFC 108.
Back into title contention.
Evans fought Thiago Silva in the main event of UFC 108 on January 2, 2010. Dana White was quoted as saying that if Evans could defeat Thiago Silva at UFC 108, then he would go on to face Quinton "Rampage" Jackson. During the Spike TV broadcast of the UFC 108 preliminary card, Evans confirmed that he received his Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt under Rolles Gracie that morning. Evans would go on to defeat Thiago Silva – another BJJ black belt – by unanimous decision. Deviating from his usual standing and striking, Evans displayed his grappling skills with numerous takedowns that frustrated Silva throughout the match, but Evans failed to damage Silva substantially while on the ground. In the third round, after severely mocking his opponent's fighting style with various taunts, Silva connected with a right hook to Evans' jaw, rocking him. Silva hesitated in finishing Evans off in order to return the taunting, however, and Evans was able to recover leading to a UD win. Evans was expected to finally face rival Quinton Jackson at UFC 113, but the bout took place on May 29, 2010 at UFC 114.
Evans caught Jackson with a right hand early in the first round and throughout the rest of the fight tried to take Jackson down, succeeding three times out of nine. In the third round Evans was hurt by Jackson but recovered and ended the final round with another takedown and strikes on the ground. The judges scored the bout 30–27, 30–27, 29–28 giving Evans the unanimous decision. Afterwards UFC President Dana White then officially confirmed that Evans would square off against Maurício Rua for the UFC Light Heavyweight title, but not until mid-Spring or early-Summer of 2011 as Rua recovered from knee surgery. The fight was then booked for the main event of UFC 128 when the UFC returned to Newark, New Jersey.
Following Evans's training partner Jon Jones' victory over Ryan Bader at UFC 126, it was announced that Evans injured his knee during training. Jones was then told in his post-fight interview that the UFC wanted him to replace Evans in his fight against Mauricio Rua for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. Jones accepted and the fight was set for UFC 128. It was then expected that if Jones won, he would face Evans in his first title defense.
During a UFC 128 post-fight interview with Ariel Helwani, Evans stated that he was done training at Jackson's Martial Arts in preparation for his fight with Jon Jones. He then commenced training at Imperial Athletics in Boca Raton, Florida, at a new camp co-founded by Evans and several Brazilian fighters who had concomitantly left American Top Team due to a dispute over management services; these were later joined by some African-American fighters, and as a result the camp's members became known colloquially as the "Blackzilians," especially on Twitter. Evans gave further insight to MMAWeekly about his leaving Jackson's Submission Fighting, “When you get to a certain point, you really need a lot of time (with the coaches)… make sure you get the one-on-one, and you just need different things,” he explained. “After being at Jackson’s for a while, with so many people at the gym, it just got harder and harder for me to get that time."
Evans/Jones was expected to take place on August 6, 2011 at UFC 133, but Jones was sidelined with a hand injury. Evans was expected to face rising prospect Phil Davis at the event instead. A title fight between Jose Aldo and Chad Mendes was delayed, so the UFC promoted Evans vs. Davis to serve as the main event. However, with less than four weeks until the event, Davis pulled out of the bout citing a knee injury. A rematch with Tito Ortiz was scheduled to headline the event. Evans defeated Ortiz at UFC 133 via TKO in the second round. The victory secured Evans a title shot against Jones.
Evans and Jones were rumoured to finally clash on December 10, 2011 at UFC 140. However, a lingering thumb injury cost Evans another title opportunity, and he was replaced by Lyoto Machida to fight Jon Jones for the belt at UFC 140. Jones retained the Light Heavyweight belt, defeating the challenger Machida, leaving open the possibility of a future fight between Evans and Jones for the title.
Evans faced Phil Davis on January 28, 2012 at UFC on Fox 2. He won the fight via unanimous decision. Evans out-wrestled the former division one national wrestling champion landing numerous takedowns throughout the fight.
In his second title shot, Evans, at long last, faced UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones on April 21, 2012 at UFC 145. Evans lost to Jones via unanimous decision.
In his first post-title shot fight, Evans faced Antônio Rogério Nogueira in the co-main event at UFC 156 on February 2, 2013. Nogueira won the fight via unanimous decision.
Evans faced Dan Henderson on June 15, 2013 in the main event at UFC 161. He won the fight by split decision.
Evans faced Chael Sonnen at UFC 167 in a Light Heavyweight bout on November 16, 2013, in the co-main event of the evening. He won the fight via TKO in the first round.
Evans was expected to face Daniel Cormier at UFC 170 on February 22, 2014. However, a leg injury knocked him off the card just 10 days before the event. Originally expected to be out for a month, Evans is now sidelined indefinitely putting a stop to his current title run.
Evans is expected to return to fighting in the fall of 2014.
Personal life.
Evans and his ex-wife have one son and a daughter. He also has a daughter from a previous relationship.
Evans' brother Lance made a brief appearance on "", but was eliminated by Vinicius Magalhaes due to a rib injury and did not join the cast.
Evans has appeared in a Microsoft commercial, where he says the lines, "You got a problem with that!" and "I'm a PC!", while sparring with an unidentified opponent. Evans is a frequent commentator on the ESPN show MMA Live. Evans also made an appearance on Spike TV's show Deadliest Warrior. In the episode, Evans easily pierces a pig carcass with the xyston similar to one used by Alexander the Great, and crushed a gel torso's throat with an elbow.
In March 2013, Evans announced his support for same-sex marriage and LGBT rights.

Qian Xuan

Qian Xuan (; 1235-1305) courtesy name Shun Ju (舜举), pseudonyms Yu Tan (玉潭, "Jade Pool"), Xi Lan Weng (习嬾翁), and Zha Chuan Weng (霅川翁) was a Chinese painter from Hu Zhou (湖州） (present day Wuxing District in Zhejiang) during the late Song and early Yuan era. He started as an aspiring scholar-official during the Southern Song. He had difficulty climbing the ranks of officialdom and when the Mongol-founded Yuan Dynasty took over the southern regions of China in 1276 he effectively gave up on the idea. Although in 1286 his friend Zhao Mengfu accepted a position and so for a time it seemed he could as well, he refused on patriotic grounds, citing old age in order to avoid difficulties. 
Qian Xuan's life after 1276 was devoted to painting, and he became noted as a "fur and feathers" painter. He was also adept at bird-and-flower painting, character painting, and landscape painting ("shan shui"). He is known for landscapes that hinted at a longing for a return of native Chinese rule, such as in the work "Home Again." He mixed Song realism with an archaic Tang style.

Walk Away Renée

"Walk Away Renée" is a song recorded by the band The Left Banke in 1966 (single release: July 1966, Smash Records, title printed as "Walk Away Renee"), written by the group's then 16-year-old keyboard player Michael Brown (real name Michael Lookofsky) and Tony Sansone and Bob Calilli. The song was also a chart hit for the Motown group the Four Tops in 1968.
The song features a flute solo played during the instrumental bridge of the middle portion of the song. Michael Brown got the idea for the flute solo from The Mamas & the Papas song "California Dreamin'" which had been recorded in November 1965 but wasn't a hit and in heavy rotation until early 1966. The arrangement also includes a lush string orchestration, a memorable harpsichord part, and a descending chromatic bass melody which led critics to refer to the group's sound as Baroque pop, "Bach-Rock" or Baroque n Roll.
"Rolling Stone" placed the song at number 220 in the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. After its initial release, it spent 13 weeks on the charts with a top spot at #5. It has been widely recorded by singers in a wide range of genres and styles, often with great success. For example, Linda Ronstadt and Ann Savoy recently recorded the song on their album "Adieu False Heart". The "New York Times"' reviewer Jon Pareles stated of their version that:
The real Renée.
There is some confusion over the original author of "Walk Away Renée." One source says that the lyrics to "Walk Away Renée" were originally written by Richard Swank, then of Lufkin, Texas.19 Swank co-founded a small, unsuccessful band with his surfing buddy, Jerry, in the 1960s. Together, they played occasional gigs at pool halls near the Lufkin, Texas area (then part of a dry county, causing its inhabitants to visit neighboring counties for adult beverage and entertainment). While playing pool one Friday night, Jerry invited his friend, John Frank Wilson, also a Lufkin native and lead vocalist of The Cavaliers, whose first hit was "Last Kiss." Wilson had attended a prior gig and overheard Swank singing a song about Renee, his former girlfriend who had severed relations shortly before. Swank and Wilson struck up a conversation over drinks, and Wilson asked about the lyrics, saying he knew someone who could make the songs hits. Swank and Wilson subsequently met at the River Pool Club, where Swank wrote down the lyrics and gave them to Wilson. It was through Wilson that The Left Banke obtained Swank's lyrics to the song, "Walk Away Renée." After separating with Swank, Renée went on as a music major at Temple University, spent a couple years traveling in Europe, married another singer, and now resides near Los Angeles, California, where she works as a paralegal at a law firm and doubles as the occasional opera singer.
Another source says the song is one of a number Brown wrote about Renée Fladen-Kamm, then-girlfriend of The Left Banke's bassist Tom Finn and object of Brown's affection. She was associated with the band for a few weeks, and described as a free-spirited and tall blonde. The song was written one month after Brown met her. "Walk Away Renee" was one of a series of love songs the infatuated Brown wrote after meeting his newfound muse. Other songs written about her include the band's second hit "Pretty Ballerina" and "She May Call You Up Tonight". After decades of obscurity, she was identified in 2001 as a noted singer, vocal teacher and artist on the West Coast.
Brown says of his unrequited love for Renée:
Fladen-Kamm was looking on during the recording of the song, and her presence nearly prevented its completion. In an interview, Brown stated:
However, co-author Tony Sansone has given a different version of the origin of the song. Sansone has stated in interviews that he wrote the lyrics for the song, and that he randomly chose the name Renee because the Beatles used the name Michelle in their hit song of the same name, and so he did likewise, choosing the French name Renee as the female object for the song.
Notable recordings.
The Four Tops' recording of the song was featured on their 1967 album "Reach Out" and is arguably the most famous cover version of the song, having reached #14 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and #3 on the UK Singles Chart in 1968.

Edward V. Babcock

Edward Vose Babcock (January 31, 1864 – September 2, 1948) was a lumber industrialist who served as Mayor of Pittsburgh from 1918 to 1922.
Biography.
Early life.
Edward Vose Babcock entered the lumber business from an early age. He ran successfully for City Council in 1911 and began making a political name for himself.
Pittsburgh politics.
Unlike his predecessor "Joe the builder", Babcock's administration had little time to implement much policy, they were too busy dealing with the triple threat of a massive steel strike that created much social dissension and unrest, the 1918-1919 flu pandemic that hit Pittsburgh especially hard, all this while at the family dinnertables and company lunch rooms around the city the women's suffrage movement tested the strength of families and employers. 
Despite all of those challenges to Babcock's focus on his agenda, he did make some lasting accomplishments including expansion and groundbreaking of new parks and playgrounds, along with the modernization of some key traffic arteries within the city. In response to the suffrage movement, Babcock became the first mayor to appoint a woman to a cabinet level position within the city.
Later life.
After leaving the mayor's office Babcock continued his political career at the county level, becoming a commissioner in 1927. During his rule of Allegheny County he was successful in pushing through the opening of the Allegheny County Airport in West Mifflin, he also was instrumental in providing county help to the city for the opening of the triplet bridges (6th, 7th and 9th Street Bridges).
He was also extremely generous, purchasing at personal expense 4,000 acres (16 km²) of land for the expansive "North Park" and "South Park" in the county. He retired in 1931 and died in 1948, being buried in Homewood Cemetery.

Jefferson Park (Seattle)

Jefferson Park is a 52.4 acre (212,055 m²) public park and golf course on top of Beacon Hill in Seattle, Washington, bounded on the east by 24th Avenue S. and 24th Place S., on the west by 15th Avenue S., on the north by S. Spokane Street, and on the south by Cheasty Boulevard S.
History.
The park site was originally planned by the State of Washington for state university use. In 1892, it was the site of a "pesthouse," or isolation hospital. In 1898, the land was sold to the city of Seattle, with plans to build a reservoir and a cemetery. In 1908, the park was named for Thomas Jefferson. 
The Olmsted Brothers included the park in their comprehensive plan for Seattle parks, and designed the 18 hole golf course which opened in 1915. 
During World War II, Jefferson Park contained anti-aircraft batteries, and was requisitioned by the U.S. Army for a G.I. recreation center, with recreation facilities, a gym, and tent housing for soldiers and visiting family. 
In the post war years, the park returned to normal; the Army structures were mostly removed, though a new Veterans' Administration hospital was built on the site of the original 9-hole golf course. (A replacement 9-hole course was built elsewhere in the park.) A lawn bowling green and playgrounds were also constructed at this time.
This is also the home course of golfing great Fred Couples.
The park today.
The Jefferson Park Golf Course, the Jefferson Community Center, Jefferson Lawn Bowling green, and playfields continue to be heavily used. Jefferson Park received $8 million from the recent ProParks funding levy, allowing redevelopment and remodeling to begin. Projects in this park revitalization effort include new walking paths, gardens, and a new gymnasium. The Jefferson Park expansion officially opened October 28th, 2010.
In 2012, the park will have a groundbreaking for the Beacon Food Forest, a 7-acre forest gardening project on the west side of the reservoir.
In June of 2014 a 'skate space' designed by artist CJ Rench opened up to the public. A sculpture that is specifically designed for skateboarding.

Arthur Peppercorn

Arthur Henry Peppercorn, OBE (29 January 1889 - 3 March 1951) was the last Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the London and North Eastern Railway.
Career.
Arthur Peppercorn was born in Leominster in 1889 and educated at Hereford Cathedral School. In 1905 he started his career as an apprentice with the Great Northern Railway (GNR).
He succeeded Edward Thompson as CME on 1 July 1946 but his style of work was more like Thompson's predecessor Sir Nigel Gresley. Peppercorn finished several projects which were started by Thompson, but most popular were his LNER Peppercorn Class A1 and the LNER Peppercorn Class A2. These were known as some of the best British steam locomotives ever in service. Upon nationalisation and the foundation of British Railways, he continued in essentially the same job, now titled "Chief Mechanical Engineer, Eastern and North Eastern Regions"; he retired at the end of 1949, two years after nationalisation. Overall he was active as a railway Chief Mechanical Engineer for three and a half years.
Legacy.
Only one of his famous Pacific locomotives, a LNER Peppercorn Class A2, 60532 "Blue Peter", was preserved, but none of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1. 
However, a brand new A1, 60163 "Tornado, built as the next in the class, has been constructed. It moved under its own steam for the first time in August 2008.
Arthur Peppercorn's widow was honorary president of the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, builder of "Tornado". At age 92, she lit the first fire in "Tornado’s" firebox in January 2008, and was later on the footplate for "Tornado's" inaugural steaming at Darlington works, stating "My husband would be proud.".

<doc id="2903988" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2903988" title="Buitreraptor">
Buitreraptor

Buitreraptor is a predatory dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur from the Cretaceous of Argentina.
"Buitreraptor" was described in 2005. The type species is "Buitreraptor gonzalezorum". It was rooster-sized and had a very elongated head with many small teeth.
Description.
"Buiteraptor" was a rather small species. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the length at 1.5 metres, the weight at three kilograms.
"Buitreraptor" has some different physical features than typical northern dromaeosaurs, such as "Velociraptor".
"Buitreraptor" has a slender, flat, extremely elongated snout with many small teeth that lack meat-tearing serrations or cutting edges and are grooved, strongly recurved and flattened. From this, the scientists who initially described it concluded that this dinosaur was not a hunter of relatively large animals like some other dromaeosaurs, but rather a hunter of small animals such as lizards and mammals. The forelimbs of "Buitreraptor" were long and ending in hands with three fingers. The fingers were proportionarly shorter than in other dromaeosaurids, and of essentially the same length, contrary to most of its relatives, which had fingers of different length, with the second finger being considerably longer.
The body as a whole was also very elongated, with a shallow ribcage. The sickle claw at the second toe of the foot was relatively short and broad.
Feathers.
No fossil discoveries have been made of any feathers of "Buitreraptor". However, there are relatives like "Microraptor" and "Sinornithosaurus", of which fossils with preserved feathers are known. Since its close relatives had feathers, it is likely that "Buitreraptor" also was feathered. According to Apesteguia, this is comparable to reconstructing an extinct monkey with fur because all modern monkeys have fur.
Paleobiogeography.
Other than "Buitreraptor", the only other known dromaeosaurs from the southern continents are "Neuquenraptor", "Austroraptor", and "Unenlagia" from South America (discovered earlier in 2005), "Rahonavis" (once thought to be a true avian bird) from Madagascar, and unidentified dromaeosaur-like teeth from Australia. This discovery in the Southern Hemisphere helped scientists to clarify that the dromaeosaur family was more widely dispersed around the world than previously thought. Evidence indicates that dromaeosaurs first appeared during the Jurassic Period, when all the continents were much closer together than they are today. With the discovery of "Buitreraptor", the scientists proposed that dromaeosaurids originated somewhere around 180 million years ago, before Pangaea broke up. However, other paleontologists have in later studies placed the time of origin for dromaeosauridae to about 160 million years ago.
The scientists see it as an alternative possibility that dromaeosaurids originated on the ancient continent Laurasia in the north and during the Cretaceous Period migrated to southern Gondwana, since the species known from the Southern Hemisphere bear distinctive characteristics not shared by their northern relatives. La Buitrera also yielded remains of terrestrial crocodiles, pterosaurs, the largest known rhynchocephalians, limbed snakes, iguanian lizards, chelid turtles, mammals, and dipnoan fishes 
Phylogeny and discussion about flight.
"Buitreraptor" shows a mosaic of dromaeosaurid, troodontid and avialan traits. It was in 2005 assigned to the Dromaeosauridae. A cladistic analysis by the describers showed it was part of the dromaeosaurid Unenlagiinae.
The discovery of "Buitreraptor" has also been the subject of discussion among scientists as to the question whether flight could have evolved independently in birds and dromaeosaurids or was derived from some flying common ancestor. Some scientists propose that "Rahonavis", a relative to "Buitreraptor", could fly. However, evidence for flight has not been unequivocally found in other dromaeosaurids, which has led some scientists to propose that dromaeosaurids evolved flight independently of birds if "Rahonavis" could indeed fly.
The following cladogram is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Turner, Makovicky and Norellin 2012, showing the relationships of "Buitreraptor" among the other genera assigned to the taxon Unenlagiinae:
Discovery and naming.
Four skeletons of "Buitreraptor" were found in 2004 in sandstone in Patagonia, Argentina during an excavation led by Sebastián Apesteguia, researcher of CONICET at the Fundacion Felix de Azara - Maimonides University, and Peter Makovicky, curator of dinosaurs at the Field Museum in Chicago.
"Buitreraptor" is from the early Late Cretaceous Candeleros Formation, dating to the Cenomanian-Turonian, about 94 million years ago, when South America was an isolated continent like Australia today. It was uncovered in a famous fossil site named "La Buitrera", the "vulture roost". Although dinosaurs are rare in this site, another nearby site had earlier yielded "Giganotosaurus", one of the largest known carnivorous dinosaurs.
"Buitreraptor gonzalezorum" is the only known species of the genus "Buitreraptor". It was named by Macovicky, Apesteguía and Federico Agnolín. The genus name means "vulture raider", from the Spanish word "buitre" meaning vulture, in reference to "La Buitrera", and Latin "raptor", "seizer". The specific name honours the brethren Fábian and Jorge González who realised much of the actual excavation and preparation of the fossils.
The holotype specimen, MPCA 245, consists of a partial skeleton with skull of an adult individual. The paratype is MPCA 238, a sacrum with a right pelvis and right hindlimb. The two other specimens have remained undescribed.

Upper set

In mathematics, an upper set (also called an upward closed set or just an upset) of a partially ordered set ("X",≤) is a subset "U" with the property that, if "x" is in "U" and "x"≤"y", then "y" is in "U".
The dual notion is lower set (alternatively, down set, decreasing set, initial segment; the set is downward closed), which is a subset "L" with the property that, if "x" is in "L" and "y"≤"x", then "y" is in "L".
Ordinal numbers.
An ordinal number is usually identified with the set of all smaller ordinal numbers. Thus each ordinal number forms a lower set in the class of all ordinal numbers, which are totally ordered by set inclusion.

Muriel Young

Muriel Young (19 June 1923 – 24 March 2001) was a British television continuity announcer, presenter and producer.
Early life.
She was born in Bishop Middleham near Sedgefield, County Durham. As a child, she lived with her family in the gatehouse of Elmwood (now the Elmwood Community Centre), Hartburn, County Durham, near Stockton on Tees. Her father, Wilfrid Young, was chauffeur to Col. Kitching (previously being Col. Kitching's batman) who lived at Elmwood for many years after retiring from the army in 1939.
Early career.
Young worked briefly as a librarian on leaving school and attended art college, before deciding to embark on a career as an actress. She joined a repertory theatre in Henley-on-Thames, where her uncle was directing. She subsequently performed at The Gateway Theatre, London, and the Theatre Royal in Chatham. Trying to get into the movie industry, Young did some photographic modelling for advertising agencies, including promoting products such as toothpaste, which paid her enough money until she became an actress. She also studied to be a dental nurse and used her substantial artistic talents to paint glassware.
Starting out as an actress, she starred with Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall in "The Constant Husband" and was also in "The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan" (1953). She also obtained parts in the movie "The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan", acting in a segment featuring the Mikado.
Television.
In 1955, as the first ITV company Associated-Rediffusion was gearing up to launch, she intended to attend an actors' audition at the company, but mistakenly went to an announcers' audition instead. Nevertheless, Young was instantly hired and announced for Associated-Rediffusion on 22 September 1955, the opening night of commercial television in the UK. Young worked as a presenter and interviewer for regional programmes on Granada Television and Southern Television, and as a disc jockey on Radio Luxembourg. She was cast, alongside the actor Peter Sellers in the movie "I'm All Right Jack" as an announcer, without the director knowing that it was in fact her real-life job.. However, her career could have easily taken a different route. Just before joining ITV, she had been on stage touring with Eamonn Andrews, in a game show called "Double or Drop". Shortly after signing her ITV contract, he told her that he had sold the idea to the BBC. It was later used as part of the children's show "Crackerjack!".
She was probably most famous for her work as a presenter of children's programmes for Associated-Rediffusion and Rediffusion London between 1959 and 1968, working alongside Wally Whyton and Bert Weedon, and featuring the puppet characters Pussy Cat Willum, Ollie Beak and Fred Barker. The popular format thus created lasted for many years, under various titles including "Lucky Dip", "Tuesday Rendezvous", "Five O'Clock Club", "Ollie and Fred's Five O'Clock Club" and "Five O'Clock Funfair".
She was mentioned in the cover notes of the Beatles first LP album 'Please Please me'. Early in their career she was introducing the Fab Four by their first names, when after only announcing three of them the audience erupted into a frenzied screaming applause.
In the late 1960s and 1970s, Muriel Young became a staff producer of pop programmes for Granada Television, with such shows as "Lift Off with Ayshea", "Get It Together", the Bay City Rollers series "Shang-a-Lang", "The Arrows Show" and "Marc", starring Marc Bolan and the pop variety show 45. She also devised "Clapperboard", presented by Chris Kelly, Granada's film magazine show for children. Young was also an occasional panellist on the ATV talent show "New Faces".
Changing direction again in the mid-1980s, Young made two series of "Ladybirds", a Channel 4 programme from Mike Mansfield's independent company, in which she interviewed female singers including Barbara Dickson, Elaine Paige and Kiki Dee. She even went to America to speak to Rita Coolidge and Jane Birkin about their success in the entertainment industry.
Personal life.

Regional Radiocommunication Conference

A Regional Radiocommunication Conference (RRC) is a meeting held between members of the International Telecommunication Union from one or more ITU Regions, but from the whole world. Such a meeting is normally used to put in place an agreement on use of frequencies for services such as broadcasting.
Examples.
RRC ST61.
An important conference was held in Stockholm from 26 May to 22 June 1961, 38 countries were part of that meeting.
RRC-04/06.
The snappily-named "RRC-04/06" was a Regional Radiocommunication Conference held in two sessions between 2004 and 2006. It put in place a new Agreement and Frequency Plan for digital broadcasting (DVB-T and T-DAB) in Bands III, and IV & V for the whole of Region 1 and Iran from Region 3.
The first session of the Conference took place from 10 May to 31 May 2004 in Geneva, Switzerland; the second session took place from 15 May to 16 June 2006, also in Geneva.
It is intended that the resulting Plan and Agreement will replace those drawn up in Stockholm in 1961, and Geneva in 1989. The achieved agreement is known as GE-06

Modica

Modica (Sicilian: Muòrica, Greek: , Latin: Mutyca or Motyca) is a city and "comune" in the Province of Ragusa, Sicily, southern Italy. The city is situated in the Hyblaean Mountains and, along with Val di Noto, is part of UNESCO Heritage Sites in Italy.
History.
According to Thucydides, the city was founded in 1360 BC or 1031 BC and was inhabited by the Sicels in the 7th century BC. It was probably a dependency of Syracuse. Modica was occupied by the Romans after the battle of the Egadi islands against the Carthaginians in the Punic Wars 241 BC, together with Syracuse and all of Sicily. Modica became one of the thirty-five "decuman" ("spontaneously submitted") cities of the island and was oppressed by the praetor Verres. It became an independent "municipium", and apparently a place of some consequence. The city is also mentioned among the inland towns of the island both by Pliny and Ptolemy; and though its name is not found in the Itineraries, it is again mentioned by the Geographer of Ravenna. Silius Italicus also includes it in his list of Sicilian cities, and immediately associates it with Netum (now Noto Antico), with which it was clearly in the same neighborhood. 
The southeast of Sicily and Modica (according to the German historian L. Hertling) was rapidly Christianized, as the diocese of Syracuse boasts an apostolic foundation by St. Paul in 61 AD. In 535, the Byzantine general Belisarius expelled the Ostrogoths and established for Justinian I the government of the East-Roman Empire (also improperly known as the Byzantine Empire) and the already Greek-speaking population fixed their culture until the Latinization of the Normans in the 11th century. In 845, Modica was captured by the Arabs who referred to the city as "Mudiqah". In 1091 the conquest of Modica and the entire Val di Noto ended the long lasting war of the Normans, led by Roger of Hauteville, against the Arabs.
In 1296, Modica became the capital of an important county, which under the Chiaramonte family became a flourishing semi-independent state controlling the whole southern third of the island, with the right of a mint of its own and other privileges (see County of Modica). The most striking event of the modern era was the earthquake of 1693, which destroyed the entire Val di Noto, although to a slightly lesser extent in Modica.
Annexed to Italy in 1860, Modica remained district capital until 1926, when it was included in the province of Ragusa.
Main sights.
As the city developed it gradually became divided into "Modica Alta" (Upper Modica) and "Modica Bassa" (Lower Modica). During the last century the city has extended and developed new suburbs which include Sacro Cuore (or "Sorda"), Monserrato, Idria, these are often referred to as Modern Modica; both old and modern quarters of the city are today joined by one of Europe's higher bridge, the Guerrieri bridge, long.
Despite being ravaged by earthquakes in 1613 and 1693 and floods in 1833 and 1902, Modica has maintained some of the most beautiful architecture in Sicily, in the Sicilian Baroque style. The city possesses a large Baroque Cathedral dedicated to San Giorgio. While the cathedral was rebuilt following the earthquake of 1693, like many other parts of the city its roots are in the Middle Ages. 
There is another church dedicated to "San Pietro" in Modica Bassa, featuring a principal façade crowned by a typical Sicilian Baroque belltower, high.
Other sights include:
Economy.
The economy of the area once principally agricultural producing olives, carobs, legumes, cereals, and cattle; an extraordinary and unique product is the famous chocolate of Modica, produced with an ancient and original Aztec recipe. The city has now been joined by factories producing textiles, furniture and cars. Tourism is also an important industry to the area, since Modica entered the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002.
Culture.
The eighteenth century saw Modica in the role of art and culture town, counting philosophers (Tommaso Campailla), poets (Girolama Grimaldi Lorefice), a school of medicine (Campailla, Gaspare Cannata, Michele Gallo, the Polara family) and literary academies among its inhabitants. In the nineteenth century, feudalism was abolished and Modica became a "bourgeois" town peopled by notables such as the writer and anthropologist Serafino Amabile Guastella, the agronomist Clemente Grimaldi, the musician Pietro Floridia and many painters, historians and other intellectuals.
Modica was also the birthplace of writer Salvatore Quasimodo, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1959.

Par railway station

Par railway station serves the village and port of Par, Cornwall, England in the United Kingdom. It is the junction for the Atlantic Coast Line to Newquay. The station is operated by First Great Western, and served by trains operated by both First Great Western and CrossCountry.
History.
The station opened with the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859. A newspaper reported at the time that it "is situated on the western side of Par bay, about a mile from the pier head, close to the road to Fowey and Tywardreath, the traffic of which places as well as St Blazey and the neighbourhoods intended to receive here. The departure and arrival stations are spacious edifices, both having verandahs projecting over the platforms, with convenient waiting rooms, ticket office, porter and lamp rooms, and other necessary conveniences. A goods station has not yet been erected, but considering the amount of business likely to be transacted here it is more than probable that a goods shed will be required before long." 
The goods shed was approved by the directors on 10 February 1860 and was built of stone.
The station was too small to warrant a station master, but the "booking constable" was paid an additional 22 pounds each year by the Post Office to also act as a post master. Two cottages were built just outside the station to house railway staff.
A connection from Par to the Cornwall Minerals Railway line to Newquay was opened on 1 January 1879. This was standard gauge and so traffic between this and the broad gauge Cornwall Railway had to be transferred between trains at Par until the broad gauge was converted over the weekend of 21 May 1892. New station buildings were erected in 1884.
The Cornwall Railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway on 1 July 1889. The Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways from 1 January 1948. This in turn was privatised in the 1990s.
On 19 May 1968 an experimental Freightliner terminal was opened on the site of the now demolished goods shed. Containers were switched between rail and road vehicles; mainly china clay traffic was handled but this did not preclude other goods. It only lasted for a couple of years.
Description.
The line approaching Par from London and Plymouth descends an incline from Treverrin Tunnel, before passing under a road overbridge adjacent to the "Royal Inn", which at one time was the "Station Hotel". Between the bridge and the station approach are two cottages that were originally built as accommodation for railway workers.
The station has three platforms:
The main line climbs up as it leaves the station towards St Austell, passing over Par Viaduct and Par Harbour. Trains on the Newquay branch traverse a sharp curve of almost 180 degrees where the line then passes St Blazey Freight Yard and the old platforms of St Blazey railway station, which also has a signal box which is still open. The line then joins the route of the former Cornwall Minerals Railway north to their destination. A freight spur follows the line of the old minerals railway south into Par Harbour, passing under Par Viaduct and the main line as it does so.
Signal box.
The signal box is located at the southern end of Platform 2 and opened in 1879. When it was first built it was less than half its current length. The original box only contained 26 levers, but the frame was replaced in 1913 when 57 more levers were added. A panel has since been added to control the section through to and as far west as the now closed Probus and Ladock railway station.
Signals controlled from Par carry the identification code 'PR'.
Passenger volume.
Par station has one of the fastest growth in passenger numbers in Cornwall. Despite a slight decrease in 2007-08, comparing the year from April 2006 to that which started in April 2002, passenger numbers increased by 42%.
The statistics cover twelve month periods that start in April.
Services.
Par is served by most of the First Great Western trains on the Cornish Main Line between Penzance and Plymouth with one train per hour in each direction. Some trains run through to or from London Paddington station, including the Night Riviera overnight sleeping car service. Typical journey times by a through daytime train are around 50 minutes to Plymouth, 70 minutes to Penzance, and about 4 hours to Paddington.
There are a limited number of CrossCountry trains providing a service to Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, and Edinburgh in the morning and returning in the evening.
The branch line to Newquay sees a mixture of self-contained services and ones that run through to Plymouth. On summer weekends most of the usual local services are withdrawn and replaced by a mixture of First Great Western trains from London Paddington, and CrossCountry trains from the North of England, although most of the latter do not call at Par, running non-stop from Bodmin Parkway instead. There is no Sunday service on the branch in the winter. 
Community rail.
The trains between Par and Newquay are designated as a community rail service and is supported by marketing provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership. The line is promoted under the "Atlantic Coast Line" name.
Six pubs near Par station take part in the Atlantic Coast Line rail ale trail, including some in neighbouring Tywardreath and St Blazey.
