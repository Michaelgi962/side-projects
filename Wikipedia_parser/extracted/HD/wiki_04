Conference membership changes.
The 2013–14 season saw the largest wave of membership changes resulting from a major realignment of NCAA Division I conferences. The cycle began in 2010 with the Big Ten and the then-Pac-10 publicly announcing their intentions to expand. The fallout from these conferences' moves later affected a majority of D-I conferences. The most significant developments this season were:
In addition, four schools began the transition up from Division II starting this season. These schools will be ineligible for NCAA-sponsored postseason play until completing their D-I transitions in 2017.
The 2013–14 season is also the last for several other teams in their current conferences:

Daniele Ferri

Daniele Ferri (born 7 March 1992) is an Italian footballer who plays for Pavia, on loan from Brescia.
Biography.
Cesena.
Ferri started his professional career with A.C. Cesena. Ferri made his professional debut (and Serie B) on 23 January 2010 against Gallipoli. He substituted Ezequiel Schelotto in the 84th minute. Ferri did not play any game in 2010–11 Serie A. Ferri also spent 2 seasons with the reserve. He scored 5 goals in 2010–11 season, which already the club second topscorer, behind Alejandro Rodríguez. 
In July 2011 Ferri left for fourth division newcomer Santarcangelo along with some Cesena half-owned to full-owned players: Rivolino Gavoci (Cesena only), Kadir Caidi (Bologna/Cesena), Giacomo Bassoli (Cesena/Bologna) and renewed the loan of Angelo Gregorio, Simone Tonelli and Nicola Del Pivo, which Gregorio and Tonelli now co-owned with Parma and Vicenza respectively.
Ferri just made 9 starts in 19 league appearances with 2 goals. He also booked 2 times. Santarcangelo finished as the 8th in the Group B of the fourth division. On 28 June 2012, Cesena sold Del Pivo and followed by Ferri on 29 June.
Brescia.
On 29 June 2012, one day before the closure of 2011–12 financial year of "Brescia Calcio SpA" and "AC Cesena SpA", both clubs made a notional swap deal, a déjà vu of June 2011. It saw Ferri moved to Brescia and Brescia youngster Ephraim O'Neal moved to Cesena, both in co-ownership deal. Both 50% registration rights of the players were tagged for €1.2 million. Once again both club benefited from the swap deal in a short term to cover its financial crisis but mostly damaged by the future heavy amortization cost with impaired players resold value and/or performance, as the clubs bought a player with speculative price.
He left for Forlì, re-joining Cesena player Mattia Filippi and Leonardo Arrigoni. Ferri played for the club on 1 August 2012 in a friendly match.
Ferri returned to Brescia on 1 July 2013. He failed to find any club to borrow him in the first half of 2013–14 season. On 31 January 2014 he was signed by A.C. Pavia.

<doc id="36533991" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36533991" title="Disability and Development Partners">
Disability and Development Partners

Disability and Development Partners (DDP) is a UK charitable company limited by guarantee that works with local partners in South Asia and Africa. “"DDP works in a holistic way, recognizing the correlation between poverty and disability and the importance of tackling social, economic and human rights issues through access to income generation and education opportunities as well as providing physical rehabilitation services."”
DDP was founded in 1992 and registered as a UK charity in 1995 in London under its original name of Jaipur Limb Campaign (JLC). Recognised as a founding member of the UK Working Group on Landmines (established as the UK arm of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines), JLC actively contributed to the UK campaign and helped strengthen the international campaign against landmines.
In 2005, JLC changed its name to Disability and Development Partners. The charity’s name was originally inspired by the Indian-made Jaipur foot as JLC was campaigning for suitable rehabilitation services for the many thousands of amputees and victims of the widespread use of landmines in civil wars. The name change was motivated by the evolution of the mission of the charity over the years, broadening their field of work to all kinds of disabilities. 
Work and achievements.
DDP does not perform development work itself; rather it collects donations in the UK to fund partner projects throughout the developing world. Over its 20-year history, DDP has helped fund projects through sixteen partnerships in eight different countries.
DDP established four rehabilitation centres providing prosthetic, orthotic and rehabilitation therapy services in Mozambique, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and India. In India, the charity has been supporting Mobility India to become a leading NGO helping to develop their technical, training and community based programmes and supporting the building of their modern and fully accessible headquarters to include a rehabilitation workshop, production facilities including a Jaipur foot production unit run by disabled women, a training centre and student dormitories. DDP has supported over fifty people, (of whom half are women and many are disabled) from partner organization in six countries who have received formal training and professional skills in orthotics, prosthetics and rehabilitation therapy. They return to improve and enhance rehabilitation services provided to disabled people by their own organizations and workshops.
The development and dissemination of prefabricated calliper components and ankle joints for rapid delivery of rehabilitation services was undertaken by DDP with Mobility India, who have subsequently disseminated these prefabricated components widely in India and in other countries where polio has been a problem. DDP set up Nepal’s first Drop-in Centre for mental ill health sufferers and their families and offering a safe haven for women who were forced into destitution because of mental illness.
The charity continued to support disabled people’s human rights and inclusion campaigns in Mozambique, Angola, Nepal, India and Ethiopia. In Nepal, DDP’s partner DHRC took their campaign to Supreme Court level in Nepal to ensure that disabled children and young people’s right to a free education was protected. 
The NGO is a member of the core group that wrote the World Health Organisation’s new improved Community Based Rehabilitation guidelines published in 2011. DDP has also been supporting the development and building capacity of Aurora Deaf Aid Africa, a UK-based Diaspora group of deaf people.
Livelihood programmes were established targeting thousands of disabled adults and parents and family members of disabled children to reduce poverty among disabled people and their families in India, Mozambique, Angola, Cape Verde and Ethiopia. Inclusive education programmes in India and Ethiopia enabled hundreds of disabled and other marginalized children to have a chance in education and to change their lives for the better. 
DDP has conducted research that has led to project work. In Mozambique they researched and reported on HIV and AIDS and the extent of disabled people’s knowledge about the two and of their inclusion in prevention programmes and services as well as in national policies to do with HIV and AIDS. They used the research findings to develop programmes to get more disabled people included in mainstream HIV and AIDS projects, get services, create awareness and ensure their inclusion in national HIV and AIDS policy. In 2011 DDP produced a report on deaf children in Burundi, in particular their education and communication needs which led to funds being raised to support one of the only two deaf schools in Burundi and to support pupils who wanted to progress to hearing secondary school. There are no secondary schools for the deaf in the country.
Publications.
The report underlines the exclusion of disabled people from HIV & AIDS policies and service programmes and to identify the causes and implications of this neglect. The omission of disabled people from supra-national development instruments mirrors more general discrimination and reflects disabled people’s voicelessness and invisibility in Mozambique. The report explains the need for disabled people to be included in the country’s HIV/AIDS policy and decisions, treatment and prevention programmes and to increase disabled people’s awareness of HIV & AIDS. 
The participative research brings together associations, schools, government representatives and above all, deaf children themselves and their parents to understand the problems they face and their aspirations for the future and then to try to identify practical strategies to meet both. The study analyses the status and standard of sign language as currently used in Burundi.

Life and career.
Strantz was born in Toledo, Ohio and raised in Walbridge. He graduated from Michigan State University in 1978 with a degree in turf grass management.

He formed his own design company, Michael Strantz Studios in 1988 where he was free to apply his own design philosophies to forthcoming projects. His first solo project was Caledonia Golf and Fish Club on Pawleys Island, South Carolina in 1993. Strantz designed nine courses: 
Strantz's last project before his death from cancer at the age of 50, was the renovation of Monterey Peninsula Country Club Shore Course. Among his acknowledgments, Strantz was listed as one of the "Top 10 Greatest Golf Architects of All Time" by "Golfweek" in 2000, and he was earlier described as the "most in-demand course designer in the U.S." by "Golf World" in 1989. Three of his courses were listed in the top twenty of "Golf Digest's" 2007 list of the 50 toughest golf courses in the US.

<doc id="36534044" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36534044" title="Tanana Valley State Fair">
Tanana Valley State Fair

The Tanana Valley State Fair is an annual festival held for nine days, commencing the first Friday in August, and is a major annual event in Interior Alaska. The fair is held on a hundred-acre plot of land just outside the city limits of Fairbanks, in the approximate center of College Road. The fairgrounds, along with portions of the Creamer's Field Migratory Waterfowl Refuge and surrounding businesses on the north side of College Road, comprise the eastern reaches of the College census-designated place adjacent to Fairbanks.
It features amusement rides, food concessions, competitive exhibits, contests and live performances. As of the 81st Annual Fair in 2012, an adult day pass cost $10 and season pass cost $35. 
History.
The Tanana Valley Fair was founded in 1924, making it the oldest state fair in Alaska. Experimental agronomist George William Gasser and local real estate businessman and homesteading farmer Harry Markley Badger were instrumental in forming the not-for-profit Tanana Valley Fair Association. From 1924 to 1951, the fair was held in various locations in downtown Fairbanks. All fairs since 1952 have been held at the current location, on land which the association originally leased from the University of Alaska. 
In 1936, the Matanuska Valley Fair formed in Palmer. It saw a name change in 1959 to the "Alaska State Fair" when Alaska was upgraded from a territory to a state in the United States of America. That same year, both fairs requested to be the "Official Alaska State Fair." Subsequently, the governor of Alaska determined the fairs would alternate the title with the Tanana Valley State Fair in Fairbanks using the title in even-numbered years and the Alaska State Fair in Palmer using the title in odd-numbered years. "Tanana Valley State Fair" was adopted as the permanent name of the fair in Fairbanks in 1985. The Alaska State Fair in Palmer is held annually for about two weeks around the beginning of August.
The Southeast Alaska Fair is held in Haines for four days over the last weekend in July. There are also fairs in Ninilchik and Kodiak in late August and early September, with smaller fairs held in Delta Junction, Kenny Lake and Salcha.
Farmer's Market.
The associated Tanana Valley Farmer’s Market was founded in 1978 as a means for fair exhibitors to sell their produce and goods. It is currently open from May to September three days a week. The market was formerly located on the fairgrounds property, very near to the intersection of College Road and Aurora Drive and the main entrance to the fairgrounds. The market, including the building housing it, was moved to a site approximately a half-mile to the west in 2005.

<doc id="36534048" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36534048" title="Kasha (folklore)">
Kasha (folklore)

The kasha (火車, lit. "burning chariot" or "burning barouche" or 化車, "changed wheel") is Japanese yōkai that steals the ones who died as a result of accumulating evil deeds.
Summary.
They are a yōkai that would steal corpses from funerals and cemeteries, and what exactly they are is not firmly set, and there are examples all throughout the country. In many cases their true identity is actually a cat yōkai, and it is also said that cats that grow old would turn into this yōkai, and that their true identity is actually a nekomata.
There are tales of kasha in tales like the folktale Neko Danka etc., and there are similar tales in the Harima Province (now Hyōgo Prefecture), in Yamasaki (now Shisō), there is the tale of the "Kasha-baba."
As a method of protecting corpses from kasha, in Kamikuishiki, Nishiyatsushiro District, Yamanashi Prefecture (now Fujikawaguchiko, Kōfu), at a temple that a kasha is said to live near, a funeral is performed twice, and it is said that by putting a rock inside the coffin for the first funeral, this protects the corpse from being stolen by the kasha. Also, in Yawatahama, Ehime, Ehime prefecture, it is said that leaving a hair razor on top of the coffin would prevent the kasha from stealing the corpse. In Saigō, Higashiusuki District, Miyzaki Prefecture (now Misato), it is said that before a funeral procession, "I will not let baku feed on this (バクには食わせん)" or "I will not let kasha feed on this (火車には食わせん)" is changed twice. In the village of Kumagaya, Atetsu District, Okayama Prefecture (now Niimi), it is said that a kasha is avoided by playing a myobachi (妙八) (a traditional Japanese musical instrument).
Similar things to kasha.
Things of the same kind as kasha, or things thought of as a different name for kasha, are as following.
In Tōno, Iwate Prefecture, called "kyasha," at the mountain next to the pass that continued from the village of Ayaori, Kamihei District (now part of Tōno) to the village of Miyamori (now also part of Tōno), there lived a thing that took on the appearance of a woman who wore a kinchaku bag tied to her front, and it is said that it would steal corpses from coffins at funerals and dig up corpses from the gravesites and eat the corpses. In the village of Minamimimaki, Nagano Prefecture (now Saku), it is also called "kyasha," and like usual, it would steal corpses from funerals.
In the Yamagata Prefecture, a story is passed down where when a certain wealthy man died, a kasha-neko (カシャ猫 or 火車猫) appeared before him and attempted to steal his corpse, but the priest of Seigen-ji drove it away. What was then determined to have been its remaining tail was then presented to the temple of Hase-kannon as a charm against evil spirits, which is open to the public on new years each year.
In the village of Akihata, Kanra District, Gunma Prefecture (now Kanra), a monster that would eat human corpses are called "tenmaru," and in order to defend against this, the bamboo basket on top was protected.
In Himakajima, Aichi Prefecture, kasha are called madōkusha, and it is said that a cat that would reach one hundred years of age would become a yōkai.
In the Izumi region, Kagoshima Prefecture, called "kimotori," they are said to appear at the gravesite after funerals.
Considerations.
In Japan, from old times, cats were seen as possessing supernatural abilities, and there are legends such as "one must not let a cat get near a corpse" and "when a cat leaps over a coffin, the corpse inside the coffin will wake up." Also, in the collection of setsuwa tales, the Uji Shūi Monogatari from medieval Japan, a gokusotsu (an evil ogre that torments the dead in hell) would drag a burning hi no kuruma (wheel of fire), it is said that they would attempt to take away the corpses of sinners, or living sinners. It has thus been determined that the legend of the kasha was born as a result of the mixture of legends concerning cats and the dead, and the legend of the "hi no kuruma" that would steal away sinners.
There is also the theory that the legend of kappa making humans drown and taking their butts (eating their innards from their butts) was born as a result of the influence of this kasha. Also, in China, there is the legend of the yōkai called wangliang, but as it is said that they like to eat the inneards of people's corpses, it is seen that in Japan, this was mixed up with the kasha that would steal corpses in Japan, and in addition to how in the aforementioned "Bōsō Manroku," the characters 魍魎 were read "kuhashiya," in the essay Mimibukuro by Negishi Shizumori, in volume four "Kiboku no Koto" (鬼僕の事), there is a scene under the name, "The One Called Mōryō" (魍魎といへる者なり).
Re-usage of the term.
The word "hi no kuruma" which means urgency of economic conditions, comes from how the dead would receive torture from this kasha (hi no kuruma).
In the region of the Harima Province, old women with bad personalities are said to be called "kasha-baba" ("kasha old women"), with the nuance that they are old women that are like bakeneko.
How the yarite, the woman who controls the yūjo in the yūkaku, is called "kasha" (花車, "flower wheel") comes from this kasha, and as the yarite was the woman who managed everything, and how the word "yarite" is also used to indicate people who move bullock carts (gissha or gyūsha) also comes from this.

The series has Stone dealing with assassination, political intrigue, as well as human rights, white slavery, and prostitution.
Film adaptation.
In 2001 Miramax Films' Bonnie Timmerman purchased the rights to the series with the intention to film the second book in the Nick Stone series, "Crisis Four". The film adaptation faced difficulties after the events of 9/11 in the United States, with Miramax stating that they would re-write the movie script to remove mentions of Osama bin Laden. The film rights to the series were later sold to Harvey Weinstein but were repurchased by Timmerman after they lapsed in 2010.
After repurchasing the book rights, Timmerman announced that she would be adapting the book "Firewall", with the movie being named "Echelon". The script for the movie has been written by McNab and John Connor, with Ashok Amritraj set to co-produce the film with Timmerman. Jason Statham was picked to portray ex-SAS operative Nick Stone, but withdrew from the project due to scheduling issues.
Reception.
Critical reception for the series has been mostly positive, with the Irish Independent calling "Dead Centre" "biff-bang action fiction at its most uncomplicated". The Free Lance-Star positively reviewed the audiobook for "Crisis Four", stating that although the narrator's American accent was "unconvincing", his portrayal of the book's characters "sparkle with life". Kirkus Reviews' opinion of the series was predominantly positive, with the site calling "Firewall" "a sweet one" but stating that reducing "Last Light's" meticulous details "might have benefited narrative flow".
Of "Deep Black", the Harrow Observer described the novel as an "unforgettable story" from its "violent and shocking opening" that includes "vivid, lightning-paced action". A Sunday Times reviewer said that "it's not one of his strongest efforts" and that "too much of the novel consists of aimless linking material or unconvincing attempts at atmosphere". Robert Hanks of The Independent stated that "the plot strains credibility, and the terse, slangy prose is sometimes repetitive".
Publishers Weekly panned both "Last Light" and "Liberation Day", saying of "Liberation Day" that "Instead of biting their nails, readers will be staring at them absently, bored by the colorless plot". Reviewers for the company also reviewed "Firewall" and "Crisis Four", praising both entries in the series.
Controversy.
The paperback release of "Crisis Four" briefly suffered poor sales in the United States due to the book being released the week before the events of the September 11 attacks and McNab using bin Laden as the book's villain. McNab explained the usage of bin Laden as the villain, stating that "This guy's been out there for about 10 years, insane and doing his thing in the darkness ... the war against him has been going on for a long time."
McNab faced criticism for using product placement in his novel "Liberation Day", with Brand Republic reporting that the author inserted "more than 60 references to Traser watches" into the text.

Buergers' tree-kangaroo

The Buergers' Tree-kangaroo ("Dendrolagus goodfellowi buergersi") is a subspecies of the Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo from Papua New Guinea, where they dwell mainly in tropical rainforests. Their diet consists of mostly leaves and fruit, which they find both in trees and on the ground.
It is believed tree-kangaroos evolved from creatures similar to modern kangaroos and wallabies. The ancestors of all kangaroos are thought to be small marsupials that look like present-day opossums.
Tree-kangaroos have developed long tails for balancing in the trees, and strong forelimbs for climbing. Their teeth are developed for tearing leaves rather than cutting grass.
The Buergers’ Tree-kangaroo, along with nine other species of tree-kangaroo, are endangered and on the brink of extinction. The key threats to their survival include dwindling habitat due to logging; mining and logging; road kill by humans and hunted for meat by domestic and wild dogs.

Solar power in Wisconsin

Solar power in Wisconsin on rooftops is estimated to be able to provide 22% of the electricity used in Wisconsin. Net metering is available for systems up to at least 20 kW, and excess generation is credited at retail rate to customers next bill. Some utilities allow net metering up to 100 kW. For Xcel customers kilowatt credits are rolled over monthly and are reconciled annually at avoided cost. Best practices recommend no limits, either individually or aggregate, and perpetual roll over of kilowatt credits.
A 2012 estimate indicates that a typical 5 kW solar array installed in Wisconsin will pay for itself in 15 years and go on to provide an additional profit of $20,238 during its 25 year life. Wisconsin's renewable portfolio standard requires 10% renewable sources for electricity by 2015.
In 2007, Wisconsin's largest solar array was the 44.4 kW array on the Urban Ecology Center, in Milwaukee.
In 2011, the largest array was the 360 kW parking lot array in Verona, which is being expanded to 2.2 MW. A 3.177 MW array is planned for a distribution center in Oconomowoc.

A Christmas Carol (1954 TV musical)

A one-hour version of Charles Dickens's "A Christmas Carol" was presented on the CBS television anthology "Shower of Stars" on December 24, 1954. It was also one of the few American TV productions of the time telecast in England, in 1957. Unusually for the time, it was presented on film and in color. Unfortunately, only a black-and-white print seems to have survived, and it has been released on DVD. The commercials seen live during the program have also survived. The program is introduced on kinescope by host William Lundigan. 
The production boasted a script and lyrics by noted American playwright Maxwell Anderson, and a score by Bernard Herrmann. Fredric March, in his only known portrayal of the role, starred as Ebenezer Scrooge, and Basil Rathbone portrayed Marley's Ghost. 
The production featured few songs, but those it did feature forced the adapters to severely condense the story, especially the final third. Rather than having a Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, the adaptation featured a bird resembling a crow or raven, who leads Scrooge to a graveyard in which he sees not only his own grave, but that of Tiny Tim.
The script added an unusual twist to the story in having the Ghost of Christmas Past (Sally Fraser) and the Ghost of Christmas Present (Ray Middleton) be portrayed by the same actors who played Scrooge's sweetheart Belle and his nephew Fred, respectively, and Scrooge not only notices the resemblance, but mistakes the Ghost of Christmas Present for his nephew.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS)

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome still under research, leading to rapid onset Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics in children and adolescents. It may be either conntected to Group A streptococcal infections (PANDAS sub-group) or caused by immunologic reactions to other pathogens (PITANDS sub-group) affecting the basal ganglia. This portion of the brain is responsible for mediating cognition, emotion, and movement. Research into the etiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder has identified dysfunctions of the basal ganglia as a key factor for the onset of OCD.
Signs and symptoms.
According to Swedo, Leckman and Rose (2012, "Pediatrics & Therapeutics"), the criteria defining PANS will "undergo modifications and refinement as additional clinical and research experience is accrued". The proposed criteria claims that children can be distinguished from traditional childhood onset OCD by the severity, abruptness and dramatic onset of symptoms. According to Swedo, Leckman and Rose (2012), pediatric patients suffering from PANS would be identified by the following criteria:
Differential diagnostics.
As there are other conditions that may have similar presentation, diagnostic workup of individuals suspected of PANS should exclude Sydenham's chorea, lupus erythematosus, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Tourette syndrome. Evidence of acute rheumatic fever would exclude a PANS classification. Depending on neuropsychiatric symptoms, diagnostic tests may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lumbar puncture, and electroencephalography (EEG).
Treatment.
Treatment of OCD or Tourette possibly caused by PANS is generally the same as the standard therapies for OCD and Tourettes (symptomatic treatment). It has, however, been observed that children with PANS appear to be unusually sensitive to the side-effects of SSRIs. Treatment with antibiotics, and immune-based therapeutic approaches are still considered as experimental. Early and consequent treatment appears to be of importance to avoid chronification and lifelong persistence.

Niki Reiser

Niki Reiser (born 12 May 1958) is a Swiss film score composer and flautist. He is considered one of the most outstanding film composers of the German-speaking countries, winning the German Film Award five times. His debut was in 1986 the score for the film "Du mich auch", directed by Dani Levy, for whom he has composed all further scores. He had his breakthrough with the music for the film "Beyond Silence", directed by Caroline Link in 1996.
Biography.
Niki Reiser was born in 1958 in Aargau in Switzerland, the son of a pastor and a nurse. Before he came to Basel age twelve, where he has lived since, he spent four years in Schaffhausen. In addition to classical flute lessons a child, he invented his own melodies on the piano. In his youth he played in several bands, composed pieces for them and for theater performances at school.
In the 1970s, Reiser studied classical music with an emphasis on flute in Basel. From 1980 to 1984 he studied in Boston at the Berklee College of Music jazz and classical music with a focus on film music. From 1984 to 1986, Reiser lived partly in Europe, mostly in Switzerland, where he continued his studies in composition in Basel. On workshops in the U.S., he met Ennio Morricone and Jerry Goldsmith who influenced his music. During this time he composed his first pieces for movies. During this period he also toured as a jazz flutist with the ensemble "People", which he had co-founded.
In 1986, Reiser moved back to Europe where he met the film director Dani Levy. He composed the music for his first film "Du mich auch". The film was a surprising success throughout Europe and was nominated for the Golden Camera at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1987. This encounter started a lasting friendship, resulting in Reiser composing the music for all of Levy's films.
At that time Reiser joined the klezmer band Kolsimcha as a flutist, and composed several pieces for the group. On two world tours he played with the band in Carnegie Hall and at the Montreux Jazz Festival, among others.
When Reiser realised that it was impossible to be a flutist and a composer at the same time, he concentrated on composition. In addition to working with Levy, he also composed for Caroline Link, whom he met in 1996. His breakthrough came with the music for her movie "Beyond Silence". For her film "Nowhere in Africa", Reiser studied African music in Nairobi. The influences of indigenous Kenyan music can be seen in the score he composed for the film. In addition to cinema and TV films, he also wrote music for the theater. In 2008 he worked again for Link for "Im Winter ein Jahr". The score won both the Preis der deutschen Filmkritik and the Deutscher Filmpreis of 2009.
Reiser has his studio in Basel's Gundeldingerfeld. He is on the board of the Deutsche Filmakademie since its inception in 2003.
Awards.
As of 2012, Reiser was awarded the German film prize Deutscher Filmpreis five times. In 2005, he was the 12th recipient of the Rheingau Music Prize, as "a composer who repeatedly and majestically succeeds in meeting the particular dramaturgical needs entailed by film scores, and thus suffusing each individual work with its own unique sound".

John Najjar Ferzely known as John Najjar (Nov. 11, 1918; Jan. 6, 2011), was a lead designer and executive stylist at Ford Motor Company for over 40 years. 
He is credited for having co-designed the first prototype of the Ford Mustang known as Ford Mustang I with Philip T. Clark.
John Najjar was born to a working-class Greek Orthodox Christian Lebanese family in Omaha, Nebraska. He joined Ford Motor Company's Apprentice School in Dearborn, Michigan. While working there as a mere machinist, he was approached by Henry Ford during a plant tour who asked him if he enjoyed his work. John's response that he'd "rather be drawing cars" led to an invitation for him to add his talents to Ford's newly created Design Center. 
He continued working as a designer for Ford for over 40 years. He worked with E. T. Gregorie, George Walker, Elwood Engel, Gene Bordinat and Lee Iacocca. For many years his work was centered on futuristic show cars whose revolutionary features later appeared in many Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.
John's Advanced Styling Studio developed the 1962 Ford Mustang I concept car - so named because of his love for its namesake, the P-51 Mustang fighter plane. His design talents span decades - from work on the M4A3 Sherman tank and B-24 bomber in the 40s, the 1957-58 Lincoln Continentals, the XM-800, the soybean car, the LevaCar concept, the Gyron, Detroit's People Mover and Renaissance Center. 
John Najjar also co-designed jointly with fellow Ford Motor Company stylist Bill Schmidt the groundbreaking Lincoln Futura, a futuristic concept car that served as a base for the Batmobile for the 1966 TV series Batman, as well as for the first movie adaptation of the Batman comics.

Tajikistani presidential election, 2013

Presidential elections were held in Tajikistan on 6 November 2013. Incumbent President Emomalii Rahmon was re-elected with a reported 86.9% of the vote on a turnout of 86.6%.
In power since 1992, Rahmon was seeking a new term in office, and was widely expected to be re-elected. None of his five opponents, who were "virtual unknowns even inside the country", publicly criticised him, while Oynihol Bobonazarova, a human rights activist generally regarded as the only real opposition candidate was prevented from running, having narrowly failed to obtain sufficient signatures to register as a candidate. Her Islamic Revival Party blamed local authorities for harassing party activists who were seeking to collect signatures.
Electoral system.
The President was elected for a seven-year term, with a 50% turnout needed to validate the result. Potential candidates needed to collect 210,000 signatures in order to participate.
Voting centres closed at 22:00 and initial official results were due early the next day.
Campaign.
Oynihol Bobonazarova of the Islamic Revival Party withdrew her candidacy on 11 October 2013 after collecting only 202,000 of the 210,000 required. The party claimed this was due to harassment from local authorities during the signature campaign and that it would not take part in the election.
The Social Democratic Party also boycotted the election due to what it said were "violations of the constitution, organised falsifications and a lack of democracy and transparency."
Conduct.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitored the elections. It reported "significant shortcomings" in the conduct of the poll, and criticised "restrictive candidate-registration requirements" including an "unreasonably large number of signatures potential candidates must gather to qualify", which it considered "resulted in a lack of pluralism and genuine choice."

<doc id="36534290" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36534290" title="Adriatic railway">
Adriatic railway

The Adriatic railway (Italian: "Ferrovia Adriatica") is the railroad from Ancona to Otranto that runs along the Adriatic Coast of Italy, following it almost all of the way. It is one of the main lines of the Italian rail system and links the northern cities with the most important productive areas of central and southern Italy.
The railroad was built by the Società per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (Italian: "Company for the Southern Railways", "SFM"), between 1863 and 1872. In 1906, management of the line was taken over by Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane. In 1933, the southernmost Lecce-Otranto segment of the line was turned over to the Ferrovie del Sud Est, which has maintained it to the present day.
History.
Shortly after the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, the new government took over the granting of railway concessions, which, in prior years, had often been doled out in a haphazard manner by the different states and provisional dictatorial governments of the Italian Peninsula to various companies: canceling some, changing others and continually releasing new rights-of-way.
In November 1861 the Milan–Bologna railway line began operation, with the connection of the Milan-Piacenza line to the Piacenza-Bologna via a bridge – initially of wood but later replaced by an iron structure – across the river Po. This allowed trains from Turin and France to travel directly to the Adriatic coast along the Ancona-Bologna line, which itself had been built in November 1861 by the SFR, in what was then the Papal States.
The construction of an Adriatic line had long been desired, but had never come to pass: mainly because of the difficulty in reconciling the needs of the two countries – the Papal States and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies – through whose territories the line would pass. The constitution of the kingdom of Italy in 1860 brought a resolution to this dilemma, and, as entrepreneurs in Piedmont and Lombardy desired access to Adriatic ports for closer and easier trade with Asia through the Suez Canal, construction would proceed rapidly following unification.
As early as May 1861, a detailed and complex feasibility study was presented to the Chamber of Deputies for new railways in southern Italy that were considered of vital importance. In particular, the construction of a railway along the Adriatic coast from Ancona to Brindisi and Otranto was seen as essential, as these ports were considered by many to be on the verge of becoming Europe's "door to the East." At that time, several European countries were competing for the privilege of transporting the Imperial Indian Mail train (referred to in Italy as the "Valigia delle Indie"), in hopes of sharing in the profits of the trade between England and its vast colonial empire. In July 1862, Count Pietro Bastogi, former Finance Minister of the Kingdom of Italy succeeded in putting together a consortium of 92 bankers with the huge sum (at that time) of 100 million gold Italian lira of capital from entirely Italian sources. The Società per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (Italian: 'Company for the Southern Railways', SFM) moved quickly to build the rail line, completing the Brindisi-Lecce segment by 1866. The Lecce-Otranto segment was delayed by bitter controversies which prevented the choice of a route for many years. The last stretch of 19 miles from Maglie to Oltranto was not complete until 20 September 1872.
The new Adriatic Railroad allowed, for the first time, relatively rapid travel between the south and the north-central regions of Italy. In 1866, in fact, there were no railways on the Tyrrhenian coast south of Eboli. Vittorio Emanuele II on 9 November 1863 inaugurated the line with his train ride from Pescara to Foggia, following hurried work to finish the track. The public opening was postponed until 25 April 1864. In the proceedings of the first legislature of the Kingdom of Italy, the parliamentarian Leopoldo Galeotti wrote hopefully that "before long the port of Brindisi, reborn to a new life, will bring within her breast the Indian Mail, a sure sign that the commerce of the world will be drawn a second time to our seas. In a few days, thanks to the great industry of Southern Company, despite the obstacles of every kind that had to be overcome, locomotives will arrive at the port of Brindisi." In September 1871 the completion of the Fréjus Rail Tunnel allowed the luxury "Peninsular Express" (from the same company that operated the famous Orient Express) to complete the London-Brindisi trip in 47 hours via Calais and Paris.
The line was built in record time using the easiest and least demanding engineering methods (tunnels and viaducts), often near the sea. Weather was a significant cause of work interruptions, due to the heavy storms that frequently batter the Adriatic coast.
The line was reoriented in 2004, with double tracking, for the stretch from Lesina to Apricena (saving about 2.5 km), while at the end of 2005, the railway between Ortona and Vasto Casalbordino and between the Port of Vasto and Vasto / San Salvo were also realigned; for the dual purpose of eliminating the multiple curves in the old section, and reducing the danger posed by storm surges and coastal erosion.
Between 2002 and 2006 the track between Brindisi and Lecce was doubled, followed by the segment between Bari Centrale and Fasano. In 2007 the segment between San Severo and Apricena was also given double track.
The only stretch of the Adriatic line that remains single track is from Termoli to Lesina, which is the bottleneck of the line.
Features.
A notable aspect of the Adriatic line is the almost total absence of tunnels, with the exception of the Pescara-Vasto segment, where there are seven, including three with a length greater than 5000 m. The railroad is almost entirely double track, and is DC electrified to 3000 V.

The Azerbaijan America Alliance hopes to reach out and educate congressional representatives on the growing significance of Azerbaijan’s relationship with the United States – politically, economically and militarily.
Through such a program of education, the alliance hopes to bring renewed focus on the South Caucasus region and, in particular, the important role that Azerbaijan plays in the War on Terror - providing troops and allowing free movement of American troops through their territory - and as a market for American businesses.
Political goals.
• Expand the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus
• Educate the United States Congress on the geopolitical significance of the relationship between Azerbaijan and the United States
• Repeal Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act
• Encourage politicians to help mediate an amicable settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict
Azeri diaspora in the U.S..
The alliance recognizes and respects the important work that existing diaspora groups have done over past decades, building a core community through a variety of grassroots events. The alliance is dedicated to the diaspora and looks forward to making their contribution to the community.
The alliance hopes that, working alongside existing groups, they can expand and improve the Diasporas grassroots efforts - building a truly national community to support the alliance's political initiatives.
Key issues.
Section 907.
In 1992 Congress passed the Freedom Support Act, which was designed to assist former Soviet republics in their transition to democracy. The only republic excluded from this aid package was Azerbaijan, which was singled out in Section 907 of the Act.
Section 907 bars direct American aid to the Government of Azerbaijan unless the President of the United States certifies to Congress that Azerbaijan is “taking demonstrable steps to cease all blockades and other offensive uses of force against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.” 
The alliance believes this provision is both unfair and illogical.
Position of the alliance.
Alongside the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, the alliance is dedicated to educating members of Congress about Section 907 and working towards expanding the number of Members who support its repeal.
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
Beyond the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the prospect of renewed military conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh poses a very real threat to regional security, the global energy market and the political stability of the South Caucasus. Consequently, the time has come for renewed international efforts at finding a diplomatic solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict that is peaceful, just and honorable for all parties.
Position of the alliance.
The alliance supports UN General Assembly Resolution 62/243, adopted on March 14, 2008, which reaffirmed the "continued respect and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity" of Azerbaijan "within its internationally recognized borders.”
At the same time, the alliance understands that this conflict can only be solved by the elected leaders on all sides. Accordingly, they are working tirelessly to educate elected officials in the United States and Europe on the urgent need to mediate a resolution to the conflict. With their help, the alliance hopes to end the bloodshed which has engulfed Nagorno Karabakh for decades, to help refugees – both Armenian and Azeri – to rebuild their lives, and to foster stability and economic development for the entire region.
Areas of focus.
Grassroots and NGOs.
While the alliance also works alongside political leaders and business executives, at heart it remains a grassroots organization – committed to serving and relying heavily on the Azeri-American community for its success. The alliance hopes that through their efforts they can bring together Azeris from across the world and ensure that their voices are heard.
Academia and think tanks.
The alliance is engaging influential members of the academic community in order to highlight the growing importance of the Caucasus region in 21st century geopolitical conflicts. In this way, they hope to expand the number of centers which cover Azerbaijan and the Caucasus region.
In addition, the alliance will work with them to expand the number of fellowships, internships and exchanges available to students and academics who wish to study the region. This should lead to a greater flow of ideas and information between the two countries and ensure that a more balanced debate occurs in the public arena.
Business and economy.
The alliance works to strengthen Azeri-American business ties through the development of formal relationships between businesses in each country, as well as working with existing multinationals to expand their footprint in Azerbaijan.
The alliance has also begun to engage with institutional investors and executives who are less familiar with Azerbaijan in order to highlight available opportunities in the thriving Azerbaijani economy. In doing so, they hope to both expand and diversify Azerbaijan’s share of foreign direct investment which comes from the United States.
Politics and decision-makers.
The Azeri diaspora has a number of allies on Capitol Hill in the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, whose members will play a crucial role in helping the alliance achieve our stated goals. Congressmen Bill Shuster (R-PA) and Dan Boren (D-OK) serve as the co-Chairs of the Caucus and are exceptionally supportive of the Azerbaijani community in America.
The alliance will work with Congressmen Shuster and Boren to expand the Caucus’s membership and promote a greater degree of engagement from existing members. In particular, the Alliance hopes to make progress towards repealing Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act, which serves as a constant affront to a nation which has proved itself a loyal and valuable ally of the United States in the War on Terror.
Energy and regional security.
As the core component of its economy and one of its strongest links to the United States and Europe, Azerbaijan’s energy sector plays an integral role to its international relations. The Alliance has begun to develop relationships with industry leaders in each area to ensure that Azerbaijan’s relations with each continue to flourish.
Additionally, the Alliance hopes to emphasize the critical role that Azerbaijan plays as a stable, pro-Western democracy in a hostile region. Furthermore, its material and rhetorical backing for the War on Terror is deserving of greater recognition and support from its allies in NATO – not least the United States.
International.
While primarily focused on US-Azerbaijani relations, the alliance supports the development of closer ties between the EU and Azerbaijan. It will be working with like-minded diaspora groups in Europe to find areas of cooperation which can advance their shared ambitions.

Mike Nesbitt (American football)

Mike Nesbitt is an American football coach and former player. He was the offensive coordinator for the Houston Cougars football team at the University of Houston at the start of the 2012 college football season. He previously served as the offensive coordinator at Stephen F. Austin State University, West Texas A&M University, and Blinn College. His 2006 Blinn team won the NJCAA national championship, and his 2010 West Texas A&M team ranked second in the nation with an average of 529 yards per game in total offense.

After his college career, Nesbitt pursued a career in professional football. In June 1994, he signed a contract to play professional football for the New Orleans Saints. He was cut by the Saints in late August 1994. The following year, he was re-signed by the Saints in March 1995. He was again cut by the team in late August before the start of the regular season.
In February 1996, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings. He was released before the start of the regular season.
Coaching career.
For ten year from 1997 to 2006, Nesbitt was as a head football coach at the high school level, including stints at his alma mater Belen High School and at Albuquerque's Manzano High School. 
In June 2001, Nesbitt left his position at Manzano High School to become the running backs and kicking coach at Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas. After four years at Howard Payne Nesbitt accepted a post as the offensive coordinator at Blinn College in Brenham, Texas. At Blinn, he worked under head coach Brad Franchione, the son of Dennis Franchione who had been Nesbitt's college coach. During Nesbitt's two seasons at Blinn, the team compiled a 19-3 record and won the NJCAA national championship.
From 2007 to 2010, he was an assistant coach at West Texas A&M. After three seasons as the quarterbacks coach, he became the offensive coordinator in 2010. During the 2010 season, Nesbitt's offense was ranked as #2 in the nation with an average of 529 yards per game in total offense and #4 in scoring offense with an average of 42 points per game.
In January 2011, Nesbitt became the offensive coordinator at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas. He spent only one year at Stephen H. Austin.
In January 2012, Nesbitt was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Houston Cougars football team under head coach Tony Levine. His work with offense received favorable coverage during the spring and summer months. However, after a 30-13 loss to Texas State in Houston's season opener, Nesbitt resigned his position as offensive coordinator. The "Houston Chronicle" reported that Nesbitt was "forced to resign . . . in the wake of a stunning season-opening loss to Texas State."

The Saint (film series)

"The Saint" (film series) refers to eight B movies made by RKO Pictures between 1938 and 1941, based on some of the books in British author Leslie Charteris' long-running series about the fictional character Simon Templar, better known as "The Saint".
A few years after creating the character in 1928, Charteris was successful in getting RKO Radio Pictures interested in a film based on one of his books. The first, "The Saint in New York", came in 1938 and was based on the 1935 novel of the same name. It starred Louis Hayward as Simon Templar and Jonathan Hale as Inspector Henry Farnack, the American counterpart to the British character, Chief inspector Claud Eustace Teal.
The film was a success and seven more films followed rapidly. They were sometimes based upon outlines by Charteris, while others were based loosely on his novels or novellas. George Sanders took over from Hayward as The Saint in the second film, and starred in a further four between 1939 and 1941, before being enticed by RKO to play the lead in their forthcoming series about "The Falcon", which they made into a blatant copy of "The Saint".
In 1941, Hugh Sinclair took over the role as Templar for two more films; "The Saint's Vacation" and "The Saint Meets the Tiger". However, by the time shooting finished of "The Saint Meets the Tiger" in June 1941, a major dispute ensued between Charteris and RKO over the upcoming first film in "The Falcon" series, "The Gay Falcon", which was due for release in October 1941. Charteris argued that it was a case of copyright infringement, as RKO's version of "The Falcon" was an obvious copy of his own character, and the fact that the actor who personified "The Saint" after having played him in five of the seven films released up to that point, made this even more obvious. 
The legal dispute forced RKO to put the film on hold. The conflict wasn't settled until 1943, with RKO selling the US distribution rights to Republic Pictures, while RKO's British arm handled the UK distribution as originally planned. The film was released in both countries in 1943.
In the 1930s, RKO also purchased the rights to produce a film adaptation of "Saint Overboard", but no such film was ever produced.
A ninth film, "The Saint's Return" (known as "The Saint's Girl Friday" in the US) from 1953, with Louis Hayward returning as "The Saint", is sometimes regarded part of the RKO series. However, it was produced by British Hammer Film Productions 12 years after the conflict between Charteris and RKO, based on a special agreement between Hammer Films and Leslie Charteris, which gave Charteris a percentage in the film. RKO acted only as the film's US distributor, six months after the UK release.

Conservative Friends of Russia

The Conservative Friends of Russia (CFoR) was a political interest group formed by, yet not officially affiliated by members and friends of the Conservative Party (UK). 
Background.
The group described itself as "an organisation created for those with an interest in Russian politics, business, history and culture, with the aim of strengthening relations between the British and Russian communities and informing political decision making within both countries." 
The group was launched in August 2012 at the Russian Embassy in London. The group's launch gained mixed reviews in the media from proponents and opponents of the conservatives, with some journalists questioning its neutrality whilst others supported its goals of fostering British-Russian Relationship. 
The group had several notable Parliamentarians on its board, including former Defence and Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind as its Honorary President, and John Whittingdale MP, Andrew Rosindell MP, Nigel Evans MP, and Robert Buckland MP among its Honorary Vice Presidents.
Activities.
The group hosted events in London and at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham in 2012.It also subsidised its members to attend an event featuring international lawyers discussing the Pussy Riot incident, and hosted a debate on the US Presidential Election and its impact upon the relationship between the two countries. 
It was active in the campaign calling on the UK Foreign Office to allow British Arctic Veterans of World War Two with the Russian Ushakov Medal. On Remembrance Day 2012 it organised a letter signed by thirty two Members of Parliament demanding the veterans be allowed the medal. In December 2012 it claimed victory in its campaign (as the newly formed Westminster Russia Forum as the Prime Minister David Cameron announced that a new medal would be created. 
Renaming.
The group's Board lost all of its Conservative MPs amid allegations of being too close to the Russian authorities and it was subsequently relaunched as 'Westminster Russia Forum'. 
Controversy.
The group's neutrality and support was questioned by the media, despite the group stating no political links or bias to Russia and made it clear that its funding comes from membership and events, by publishing its financial accounts. It also supplied the Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) with a full report showing financial statements and minutes of meetings to demonstrate that there was no impropriety. 
At the end of November 2012 it emerged that the group's key contact at the Russian Embassy in London was First Secretary Sergey Nalobin, the son of a KGB/FSB general, whose brother also served in the FSB. Nalobin invited the group to hold its launch party in August in the Kensington garden of the Russian ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko.

<doc id="36534480" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36534480" title="Sailors' superstitions">
Sailors' superstitions

Sailors' superstitions have been superstitions particular to sailors or mariners, and which traditionally have been common around the world. Some of these beliefs are popular superstitions, while others are actually better described as traditions, stories, lore, tropes, myths, or legends, sometimes with a Gothic fictional element.
The origins of many of these superstitions are based in the inherent risks of sailing, and luck, either good or bad, as well as portents and omens that would be given associative meaning in relation to the life of a mariner, sailor, fisherman or a crew in general.
Bad luck.
By far the best known sailors' superstitions involve bad luck.
Jonah.
A "Jonah" is a long-established expression among sailors, meaning a person (either a sailor or a passenger) who is bad luck, which is based on the Biblical prophet Jonah . The comic character Jonah's name is a direct reference to the long established sailor's superstition.
Unlucky days.
Friday is considered to be an unlucky day in some cultures, and perhaps the most enduring sailing superstition is that it is unlucky to begin a voyage or 'set sail' on a Friday. However, this superstition is not universal. In the 19th century Admiral William Henry Smyth, writing in his nautical lexicon "The Sailor's Word-Book", described Friday as
("Dies Infaustus" means "unlucky day".) This superstition is the root of the well-known urban legend of .
Sailors are often reluctant to set sail on Candlemas Day, believing that any voyage begun then will end in disaster.
Siren.
Sirens were mythological, often dangerous and beautiful, creatures, portrayed as femmes fatales who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. They were portrayed in both Greek and Roman mythology as sea deities who lured mariners, and in Roman lore were daughters of Phorcys. In the "Odyssey", the hero Odysseus, wishing to hear the sirens' seductive and destructive song, must protect himself and his crew by having his fellow sailors tie him to the mast and then stop their own ears with wax ("see image").
In another myth, Hera, queen of the gods, persuaded the Sirens to enter a singing contest with the Muses, which the Sirens lost, out of their anguish, writes Stephanus of Byzantium, the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera ("featherless"), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called "Souda" (modern Lefkai).
Albatross.
The albatross as a superstitious relic is referenced in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's well-known poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. It is considered very unlucky to kill an albatross; in Coleridge's poem, the narrator killed the bird and his fellow sailors eventually force him to wear the dead bird around his neck.
Banana.
Having bananas on a ship, especially on a private boat or fishing yacht, is considered bad luck, according to a well-known superstition cited by the urban legend website, Snopes.com.
Whistling.
Whistling is usually considered to be bad luck with the possible exception of the sources metioned below. It is said that to whistle is to challenge the wind itself, and that to do so will bring about a storm. Another tale is that it has been considered bad luck ever since the mutiny aboard HMS Bounty; Fletcher Christian is said to have used a whistle as the signal to begin the mutiny against Captain William Bligh.
Good luck.
Sailors also had a culture of items or practices that were believed to bring good luck, or trinkets to ward off bad luck or the evil eye.
Cats.
While in many cultures, a black cat is considered unlucky, British and Irish sailors considered adopting a black "ship's cat" because it would bring good luck. Cats eat rodents, which can damage ropes and stores of grain on board, and they are intelligent animals, so a high level of care was directed toward them to keep them happy. A ship's cat would also create a sense of home and security to sailors who could be away from home for a long time.
Some sailors believed that polydactyl cats were better at catching pests, possibly connected with the suggestion that extra digits give a polydactyl cat better balance, important when at sea. Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea. It was believed to be lucky if a cat approached a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it only came halfway, and then retreated. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Other beliefs included: if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hailstorm was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind.
Whistling.
Whistling on board a sailing ship is thought to encourage the wind strength to increase. This is regularly alluded to in the Aubrey-Maturin books by Patrick O'Brian. A United States Navy saying alluded to a supposition that only homosexuals whistled.
Klabautermann.
Traditionally, a type of kobold, called a Klabautermann, lives aboard ships and helps sailors and fishermen on the Baltic and North Sea in their duties. He is a merry and diligent creature, with an expert understanding of most watercraft, and an unsupressable musical talent. He also rescues sailors washed overboard. The name comes from the Low German verb "klabastern" meaning "rumble" or "make a noise". An etymology deriving the name from the verb "kalfatern" ("to caulk") has also been suggested. A carved klabautermann image, of a small sailor dressed in yellow with a tobacco pipe and woollen sailor's cap, often wearing a caulking hammer, is attached to the mast as a symbol of good luck. However, despite the positive attributes, there is one omen associated with his presence: no member of a ship blessed by his presence shall ever set eyes on him; he only ever becomes visible to the crew of a doomed ship. The belief in Klabautermanns dates to at least the 1770s.
St. Erasmus.
Saint Erasmus of Formiae may have become the patron of sailors because he is said to have continued preaching even after a thunderbolt struck the ground beside him. This prompted sailors, who were in danger from sudden storms and lightning, to claim his prayers. The electrical discharges at the mastheads of ships were read as a sign of his protection and came to be called "Saint Elmo's Fire". Thus, Saint Elmo's Fire was usually good luck in traditional sailor's lore, but because it is a sign of electricity in the air and interferes with compass readings, sailors sometimes regarded it as an omen of bad luck and stormy weather.
Collar-touching.
It is often considered lucky to touch the collar of a sailor's suit.
Mermaids and mermen.
Mermaids usually are considered lucky, but not universally. In Trinidad and Tobago, sea-dwelling mer-men "were known to grant a wish, transform mediocrity into genius and confer wealth and power."
Mermaids appear in British folklore as unlucky omens, both foretelling disaster and provoking it. Several variants of the ballad "Sir Patrick Spens" depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships. In some versions, she tells them they will never see land again; in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are wise enough to know means the same thing. Mermaids can also be a sign of approaching rough weather, and some have been described as monstrous in size, up to .
Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" was published in 1837. The story was adapted into a Disney film with a bowdlerized plot. In the original version, The Little Mermaid is the youngest daughter of a sea king who lives at the bottom of the sea. To pursue a prince with whom she has fallen in love, the mermaid gets a sea witch to give her legs and agrees to give up her tongue in return. Though she is found on the beach by the prince, he marries another. Told she must stab the prince in the heart to return to her sisters, she can't do it out of love for him. She then rises from the ocean and sees ethereal beings around her who explain that mermaids who do good deeds become daughters of the air, and after 300 years of good service they can earn a human soul. A world-famous statue of the Little Mermaid, based on Andersen's fairy tale, has been in Copenhagen, Denmark since August 1913, with copies in 13 other locations around the world.
Sailors would look for mermaid's purses on beaches for signs of mermaids in the area.
Lore, mythology, and stories.
Davy Jones is a popular character in sailor's yore, especially of the gothic fictional variety. Davy Jones' Locker, also known as "Davy Jones's Locker", is an idiom for the bottom of the sea: the state of death among drowned sailors. It is used as a euphemism for death at sea (to be "sent to Davy Jones' Locker"). The origins of the name are unclear, and many theories have been put forth, including an actual David Jones, who was a pirate on the Indian Ocean in the 1630s, a pub owner who kidnapped sailors and then dumped them onto any passing ship, the incompetent Duffer Jones, a notoriously myopic sailor who often found himself over-board. or that Davy Jones is another name for Satan, or "Devil Jonah", the biblical Jonah who became the "evil angel" of all sailors, who would identify more with the beset-upon ship-mates of Jonah than with the unfortunate man himself. Upon death, a wicked sailor's body supposedly went to Davy Jones' locker (a chest, as lockers were back then), but a pious sailor's soul went to Fiddler's Green. This nautical superstition was popularized in the 19th century.
Kraken were legendary sea monsters that may have been based on sightings of giant squids.
Practices and semiotics.
In relation to language and cultural practices, such sailors superstitions are the consequence of folkloric practices or traditions whose meanings were once important signifiers, but now are lost to most modern sailors and laypersons alike.
Sailor Tattoos.
Sailor tattoos are a visual way to preserve the culture of the maritime superstitions. Sailors believed that certain symbols and talismans would help them in when facing certain events in life; they thought that those symbols would attract good luck or bad luck in the worst of the cases:
For example, the images of a pig and a hen were good luck; both animals are not capable of swimming, but they believed that God would look down upon a shipwreck and see an animal not capable of swimming and would take them into his hand and place them on land. Another example of superstitions is the North Star (Nautical Start or compass rose); sailors had the belief that by wearing this symbol it would help them to find his or her way home. Sailors designed mariner motifs of their own, according to their travel experiences in the ocean. By the 19th century, about 90% of all United States Navy sailors had tattoos.
Line-crossing.
The Line-crossing ceremony commemorates a sailor's first crossing of the Equator. Its practices invoke good luck on the new sailor. The ceremony of Crossing the Line is an initiation rite in the Royal Navy, U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Marine Corps, and other navies that commemorates a sailor's first crossing of the Equator. The tradition may have originated with ceremonies when passing headlands, and become a "folly" sanctioned as a boost to morale, or have been created as a test for seasoned sailors to ensure their new shipmates were capable of handling long rough times at sea. Sailors who have already crossed the Equator are nicknamed (Trusty) "Shellbacks", often referred to as "Sons of Neptune"; those who have not are nicknamed (Slimy) "Pollywogs" (in 1832 the nickname "griffins" was noted ).
After crossing the line, Pollywogs receive subpoenas to appear before "King Neptune and his court" (usually including his first assistant Davy Jones and her Highness Amphitrite and often various dignitaries, who are all represented by the highest ranking seamen), who officiate at the ceremony, which is often preceded by a beauty contest of men dressing up as women. Afterwards, some "wogs" may be "interrogated" by King Neptune and his entourage. During the ceremony, the Pollywogs undergo a number of increasingly embarrassing ordeals (such as wearing clothing inside out and backwards; crawling on hands and knees; being swatted with short lengths of firehose; kissing the Royal Baby's belly coated with axle grease, etc.), largely for the entertainment of the Shellbacks. Once the ceremony is complete, a Pollywog receives a certificate declaring his new status.

Kingston Arts Council

The Kingston Arts Council (KAC) is the oldest municipal arts council in Ontario, serving the Kingston, Ontario and surrounding region. The KAC administers City of Kingston Arts Fund grants and Nan Yeomans Grant for Artistic Development, advocates on behalf of local artists, produces an annual Arts Guide, and organizes an annual Juried Art Salon in addition to numerous other community arts events and workshops.
History.
The Kingston Arts Council was founded in 1961 in response to plans to demolish The Grand Theatre (then known as the Grand Opera House). A group of concerned citizens advocated that the theatre instead become a civic theatre, which was a success (the Grand Theatre reopened in 1964). The Kingston Arts Council adopted its constitution in 1962 and incorporated in 1963. The KAC has since grown to a major arts advocacy, funding and promotion resource in Kingston and the area.
The Kingston Arts Council made national headlines when artist Margaret Sutherland entered the piece "Emperor Haute Couture" in the 2012 Juried Art Salon. This piece portrayed Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in the nude and created controversy due to its subject and its display in the Kingston Frontenac Public Library.

Wolfson Trailer House

Wolfson Trailer House is a 1949 house designed by the pioneering modernist Marcel Breuer in Salt Point, New York, and commissioned by Breuer's friend, the artist Sydney Wolfson. It is among the most distinctive of Breuer's residential designs, as Wolfson requested that Breuer integrate his 37-foot 1948 Spartan Royal Mansion trailer as one wing of the house, which Breuer initially resisted before agreeing to. The house features many Breuer hallmarks: cantilevered living space, central fireplace made of native stone, and natural wood finishes. The house sits on 20 acres of land abutting Wappingers Creek in Dutchess County north of New York City.
In 1950, a separate artist's studio was added to the property. Plans are underway by the current owners to add a third structure to the property, designed in dialogue with the original Breuer structure.

Wallpaper (band)

Wallpaper (stylized as Wallpaper.) is an American hip hop and pop music project, fronted by producer and multi-instrumentalist songwriter Ricky Reed, based in Oakland, California. Wallpaper. is currently signed to Boardwalk Records/Epic Records and recently played at SXSW in Austin, Texas. He gained popularity due to his exaggerated use of Auto-Tune and minimal electronic music while satirizing the lack of feeling in mainstream pop.
History.
In 2005, Ricky Reed started by composing songs on the computer and exaggerating the lyrics in Auto-Tune. As auto-tune became more prevalent in mainstream music, Reed's songs gained popularity. In 2009, in his album debut "Doodoo Face" (Eenie Meenie), Wallpaper. He moved on from past satire lyrics to legitimate songwriting and masterful production. Strains of Daft Punk rattled through the seething, bass-dripping “Celebrity.” Brian Eno could be heard in the quiet electro of “Fine GF.” For “Gettin’ Drip,” he recorded his own chipmunk soul sample, while “Frk Scn” featured a distinct Ghanaian rhythm called “Ewe” that Reed beat out by hand.
In December 2010, Wallpaper. released "#STUPiDFACEDD," a song critics describe as nothing you hear everyday and that it is also very entertaining to listen to. In January 2011, Wallpaper. went on tour with The Dance Party and K.Flay. In April 2011, Wallpaper released "#STUPiDFACEDD" official video. His first Red Carpet appearance was at the MTV Movie Awards 2011 in Los Angeles, California where he started promoting his recently released music video. In August 2011, his song "#STUPiDFACEDD" was being played at radio stations all over the nation by popular demand on Likeit.fm and because of this, he started touring with the band Awolnation. After this tour ended, he got an invitation from Gym Class Heroes and The Dirty Heads to go on tour for a couple of months closing the tour at The Grove in Anaheim, California.
Wallpaper.'s new single "FUCKING BEST SONG EVERRR" was premiered on MTV's Liquid Television where critics described it as "It was just one of those nights. One wrong turn and next thing you know, you’re in the desert practicing a little botany, doing a little dancing." On December 31, 2011, he played a special concert with
Kreayshawn, Roach Gigz, Starting Six and DJ Amen at the Regency Ballroom in San Francisco, California. It peaked on the Pop Songs at number 36.
Wallpaper. performed at Coachella 2012 on April 13 and April 20. Even though he was a late addition to the festival, they managed to fill the Mojave tent with fans that followed Ricky Reed's moves. However, the set's best moment came with the unreleased "Trouble" that according to Spin Magazine sounded like something Britney Spears would have recorded back in her boa constrictor-era. Novena Carmel also performed along with Wallpaper. and a trio of tight-as-a-fist percussionists.
Wallpaper. also performed six times at in March 2011, March 12 at the Say Media Party, March 14 at the Billboard Magazine Showcase and the Idolator's 'Pray for Pop' at Pure Volume House, March 15 at MTV Woodies Festival, March 16 at the Hard Rock Music Lounge, and on March 17 at the Nylon/DUB Frequency Party. His success at SXSW led Wallpaper. to perform "#STUPiDFACEDD" at Jimmy Kimmel Live!. On May 10, 2012, Wallpaper. performed on Last Call with Carson Daly Tonight.
Ricky Reed's biggest performance so far has been at KIIS-FM's 2012 Wango Tango. Also, on May 20, 2012, he performed at the Bamboozle festival in New Jersey along with bands like Bon Jovi, Brand New and The Gaslight Anthem. His last performance was at the Nylon Music Issue Release Party where artists like Leah LaBelle and Quadron also attended. 
In 2013, the group produced Far East Movement's single "The Illest". Ricky Reed also produced the worldwide hit "Talk Dirty" by Jason Derulo, as well as Derulo's "Wiggle."
"#STUPiDFACEDD" was used in the trailer for the American action comedy film "22 Jump Street" (2014).
Online campaigns.
Wallpaper. as launched several online campaigns, including the "Ricky Reed is Real" campaign, "Fucking Best Song Ever," and "Puke My Brains Out," in promotion of newly released singles. Images of Reed and fans have been posted on several Social Networking sites like Twitter and Instagram with the tags "Fucking Best Weekend Ever, "Best Song Ever," etc. have been posted in promotion of music.

Battle of Yesil Kol Nor

The Battle of Yesil Kol Nor is a painting depicting a battle, commissioned from Chinese court painters and European Jesuit monks. East Turkestan campaign emperor Qianlong ordered the painting as part of an order of 16 large battle paintings (8m wide by 4m tall) to commemorate battles that took place in the Chinese province of Xinxjiang in Qurman (呼爾滿), in February 1759, resulting in the Chinese successfully regaining control over the province from Muslim Turkmens who had occupied the region following the Chinese ousting of the Dsungars.

The Hive, Worcester

The Hive, is a large golden-coloured building in Worcester, England, housing the Worcester Library.
Background and finances.
Designed by the architects Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios (FCBS), it opened to the public on 2 July 2012 and was officially opened by HM The Queen in the following week. Based in Bath, FCBS won the RIBA Stirling Prize, the award considered to be the most prestigious in architecture, for its masterplan for the Accordia housing development in Cambridge in 2008. This was the first time that the Stirling Prize had ever gone to a housing scheme.
Costing £60-million, The Hive was the subject of a complex Private finance initiative programme, which brought together the designers with the building contractors Galliford Try Ltd and the mechanical and electrical engineering consultants Max Fordham LLP. Originally developed in Australia in the 1980s, PFI is a method of procurring the design and construction of major public buildings by using private sector funding and contracting services. The Hive's joint commissioning clients were the University of Worcester and Worcestershire County Council. Funding was also provided by the National Lottery and the British government's Department for Culture Media & Sport and Department for Education.
It was to be an integrated public and university reference and loan library, linked to the county's Archaeological and Archive services. In addition, a 'one-stop-shop' information centre - 'The Hub' - would be operated from within the building by Worcestershire's County and District Council Services.
Once The Hive's design team had been assembled, the local authority's project managers organised a fact-finding tour of possible paradigms, with visits to The Black Diamond, Glasgow's Burrell Collection and the Heellis Building, Swindon, headquarters of the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty.
Popularity.
The Hive received 471,816 visitors in its first six months of operation, an indication that it will achieve its target of one million visitors in its first year. However, the five departments it houses were previously held at separate locations so it is inevitable that this one location will now attract considerable foot fall.It should also be noted that these are not unique users but as the count included users of the library going outside and then coming back in again on the same day- the same person could be counted many times. Many users are also compelled to use the building regardless of their feelings towards it, as the services they seek are inside. With 94.5 hours a week of operation, it has the longest weekly operating hours of any library in the UK. To keep the building running, a maximum of 50 staff are on duty, but users have complained about the difficulty of finding staff. In June 2013 The Hive won an RIBA Architectural Award.It has been noted though that all the external areas of the building such as the balcony areas have remained closed since the Hive was opened due to reasons unknown and the children outside story Island area had to be upgraded after opening as it was felt to be unsafe. That area is now only open at special request. However, the Hive has attracted considerable criticism from the students and the general public. The student body has also voiced its complaints on the Hive's Facebook page, listing the many concerns they have and explaining that their previous library was better suited to their needs.
External appearance.
The Hive has an irregular external appearance, created by its gold-coloured cladding and distinctive roof profile, formed by seven upward-facing 'cones'. These are said to have been fashioned to mimic the outline of the popular Malvern Hills. 60x60cm alloy 'tiles', made from recycled copper, cover more than 11,000sqm of the building's walls and roof. They were fixed by craftsmen from the same cladding specialists who undertook the re-cladding of the golden dome of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. The cladding which covers The Hive's horizontal facades is interrupted by large areas of double glazing in order to let as much natural light as possible into the interior.
Layout and public facilities.
The total floor area of the 5-storey building covers 13,253sqm. Located at the southernmost point of the city centre, The Hive adjoins the line of the old city wall and overlooks the River Severn.
The basement level, housing the county's archive stores, conservation department and archaeological services, is one metre above the Severn's 100-year flood level, though several flood prevention safeguards have been incorporated into the structure and the adjoining landscaping. More than 26,000 records are stored in seven climate-controlled strongrooms, including the Marriage Bond between William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway, dated 28 November 1582.
A large paved forecourt leads to The Hive's main public entrance, a naturally-lit central atrium paved with stone from the Forest of Dean, with The Hub, a café and a spacious Children's Library all set around a staircase finished in Ash wood. This is one continuous flight of 42 steps, interrupted only by three intermediate landings, which rises up through the whole building. Its structural support is provided by cross-laminated timber panels, making it an all-wood entity. Unfortunately users have complained about sound travelling to the various floors as the result of the open atrium that acts like funnel.
FCBS's colour consultant Libby Lloyd has introduced a vivid palette into the children's spaces, many 'borrowed' from historic ranges produced by the city's famous Royal Worcester potteries, including a chrome yellow Story Pit, small timber-framed alcoves for parent-child reading and a castellated outdoor Story Island. It has been noted that the cloth lined timber alcoves have already had to be recovered due the materials used being unsuitable for the environment they were put in 'Explore the Past' is the theme of the building's second level, with a number of display and presentation techniques used around the open-plan area, including pendant 'sound domes' replaying recorded extracts from the county's sound archive of oral history. It is interesting to note that in spite of this substantial investment the county archives lost a national competition to a much smaller and less well funded charitable archive. The Hive's principal public lending and reference spaces are located on the next level, where there are arrays of computers. There are a total of 350 computers distributed around the building, for joint use by members of the public and the university's students. Over 200,000 volumes are housed in book stacks whose ends contain glass-sided display cases. Two large meeting rooms and an area for magazine and newspaper reading are also on this level. Beneath the rooflights is an attic space containing Special Collections and a quiet study area.
Green issues.
The environmental brief given to the design team was that a 50% renewable energy figure had to be achieved for The Hive, which would be difficult considering the planned popularity of the building. To accommodate the energy demands expected from climate changes, the building's environmental needs were 'future proofed' on UK meteorological projections up to the year 2050.
None of the spaces in the building used by the general public have air conditioning. The large window areas provide sufficient natural light for low-energy electric lighting to be kept to a minimum, reducing both energy demands and ambient heat creation. The seven roof-mounted cones - as well as doubling as rooflights - encourage the upward movement of stale air by stack effect, mechanically aided by fans concealed beneath timber slats in the atrium floor. To safeguard against contra-flows created by external wind turbulence, which might negate this stack effect, the architects commissioned a scale model of one of the cones to be tested in a wind tunnel at Cardiff University.
A rainwater harvesting system feeds all the building's toilets and the required quietness levels needed in The Hive's extensive study areas are achieved through vertical decorative Ash 'fins' mounted on sound absorption blankets fixed to the structure's concrete soffits.
The main heating source in winter is a 550 kW biomass boiler, with emergency back-up being provided by three 250 kW gas-fired boilers. In extreme summer conditions, water from the River Trent can be pumped into the basement of the building, passed across concrete heat exchangers, with the cooled air ducted up into the central atrium. Temperature checks are maintained on the water returned to the river to comply with the UK Environment Agency's fish protection regulations.
In modern business practice the term Synergy is sometimes used to explain how the resulting conclusion of a successful operation can turn out to be greater than the sum of the constituent parts. The American Buckminster Fuller was the first western philosopher and futurologist to use this term in an architectural context, with particular reference to the energy efficiency and sustainability of buildings. The popularity of The Hive and the meeting of its challenging energy performance targets may yet lead this library to become one of the few UK examples of synergy in a public building.
Surrounding space.
As well as being the county's primary repository of archaeological finds, The Hive is sited on a historic part of the city of Worcester. The area's name, The Butts, refers to the open edge-of-city space knows as Archery butts which were designated for longbow archery practice in medieval times (23 UK towns still retain this as a place name); evidence of Roman iron ore smelting was discovered and preserved; and in Victorian times part of the site housed the city's cattle market.
In order to utilise the external spaces around The Hive for leisure and learning, landscaping consultants Grant Associates have surrounded the library with plantings of Black Pear (the county fruit of Worcestershire), black poplars, cherries, oaks, pollarded willows and medieval fruits. Tracts of wild flowers and grassed areas close to the building will act as supplementary 'coolants' for fresh air being drawn in at basement level during the summer; and for future fuel for The Hive's biomass boiler, a large plantation of willows has been established alongside the building.
Controversies and awards.
Since opening complaints have arisen from the public regarding limited choice of books, spending on non essential peripherals and the fundamental ambition of expecting academic research to occur in unmonitored and unrestricted open public spaces.
The Hive won the prize for the best new-build project of the year in the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) Building Performance Awards 2013. It was shortlisted alongside six other buildings including the Titanic in Belfast and Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. The Hive was recognised for its good practice, energy performance use of passive design and renewable technologies to create a sustainable building while delivering a high level of comfort and performance for its visitors.
The building has scooped Sustainable Project of the Year in the Building Awards 2013, fighting off stiff competition from seven other contenders. The critics described the Hive as “truly impressive”, praising its design, which is based on allowing as much sunlight into the building as possible. They were also impressed by the gold-clad cones which contain glazed rooflights and vertical glazing, as well as the low energy lighting. The use of the river Severn for water chillers, and a rainwater tank, that collects water dripping off the roof to flush the toilets were also factors in the award.

Dailenys Alcántara

Dailenys Alcántara Pacheco (born 10 August 1991) is a Cuban track and field athlete who competes in the triple jump and occasionally the long jump. She was the 2007 World Youth champion then became the first person to win two straight triple jump title at the World Junior Championships in Athletics (2008 and 2010). She represented Cuba at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics.
Career.
Born in Santiago de Cuba, Alcántara's talent for track and field was identified at a young age. She competed in sprinting events and the high jump, but found most success in the triple jump, taking victories at the Cuban schools games in 2002 and 2004. A triple jump/long jump double followed at the 2006 ESPA high school championships. Her international debut came at the age of fifteen at the 2007 World Youth Championships in Athletics. She entered the competition as the world's leading youth athletee with her personal best of 14.21 m and claimed the triple jump title ahead of fellow Cuban Josleidy Ribalta. She also placed seventh in the long jump.
Despite being one of the younger entrants, Alcántara improved two personal bests at the 2008 World Junior Championships in Athletics, jumping 14.25 m to take the triple jump gold medal and 6.41 m to earn herself the long jump bronze medal. She began to establish herself nationally in 2009 by winning the long jump at the Barrientos Memorial and placing third in the triple jump with a Central American and Caribbean junior record of 14.36 m (beating Mabel Gay's former mark). That year she entered senior international events, winning the long jump at the 2009 ALBA Games and placing sixth at the 2009 Central American and Caribbean Championships in Athletics. She also won the triple jump at the 2009 Pan American Junior Athletics Championships.
She focused just on the triple jump from 2010 onwards. She won the Barrientos Memorial that year, setting a best of 14.34 m there. At the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics she became the first athlete to win back-to-back triple jump titles and was over 30 cm ahead of the competition. The following year she set a personal best of 14.56 m in Havana, then had podium finishes on the Brazilian Athletics Tour. She was one of four Cuban women to compete in the triple jump at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, but on her major debut her mark of 13.78 m was not enough to reach the final. She defeated two-time world champion Yargelis Savigne at the 2012 IAAF Centenary meet in Havana with a personal best jump of 14.58 m. She came third at the adidas Grand Prix Diamond League meet in New York City in June and made her first Cuban Olympic team a month later.

Ronald Anderson

Ronald Eugene Anderson (born June 14, 1941), also known as Ron Anderson, is Professor Emeritus, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities where he taught sociology from 1968 to 2005. His early work focused on social and institutional factors shaping the diffusion of technology-based teaching. Since 2007, his work has focused on web-based compassion and world suffering.
Personal History.
While born in Sikeston, Missouri, from 1944 to 1953 he lived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He graduated from La Sierra University in Riverside, CA with a BA in psychology, and from Stanford University with a PhD in sociology in 1970. In 1968, he accepted a faculty position at the University of Minnesota and still resides in the Minneapolis area.
Professional History and Honors.
During most of his professional career, Dr. Anderson actively contributed in three distinct disciplines: sociology, educational research, and computer science. While his publications reside within the intersection of these fields, he has received honors or awards for outstanding service from the principal professional associations of each of these three fields: American Sociological Association, the American Educational Research Association, and the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2001, he was awarded the Outstanding Service Award by the Special Interest Group for Computers and Society of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 1990, he became an invited member of Sociological Research Association; and in 2008, he became an invited Fellow of the American Educational Research Association. In August, 2012, the Communication and Information Technology Sectionof the American Sociological Association will honor him with the prestigious William F. Ogburn Lifetime Achievement Award
Secondary (Re-purposed) Survey Data Analysis.
Ron Anderson learned secondary data analysis skills from his mentor, Stuart C. Dodd at the University of Washington in 1963, and his advisor, John W. Meyer at Stanford University. Anderson applied these skills with John O. Field to study how ideology influenced presidential elections. The resulting paper, published in the Public Opinion Quarterly, was reprinted in several major political science texts and was discussed at length by Herbert Hyman, who considered the Anderson-Field link between theoretical analysis and creative mining of secondary data resources to be exemplary and a contribution to both theory and data analysis methodology.
In 1981, Anderson received a grant from the National Science Foundation to conduct secondary analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) of science and math. One of the papers from this project was published in 1984 and was the first report on the digital divide in the United States using large-scale, national survey data. The term digital divide did not appear in the literature or the media until 11 years later.
These results, with lengthy quotes from Anderson, who directed the US portion of the study, were widely disseminated in the popular media including articles in the New York Times, the Washington Post, Business Week, the Wall Street Journal, and Ms. Magazine. In the academic literature, Anderson is reported as “explicating the depth of the digital divide in shaping the adolescent life course.” While the media focused upon the findings of sex and income gaps in access and computer course enrollments, Anderson and his associates also found major differences by race and region. Thirty years later, researchers continue to find major gaps (digital divides) in the demographics of the use of information technology In 1981, Anderson founded and served as Director of the Minnesota Center for Survey Research. He served in that capacity for five years and started the Minnesota State Survey and the Twin Cities Area Survey, both of which are still conducted annually by the Center, which is a unit of the University of Minnesota. During the next two decades, Anderson continued survey work but mostly cross-nationally, which is described in later sections below.
Computing Applications in Research and Teaching.
In the late 1960s, Anderson worked full-time as a computer programmer at the Stanford University Computation Center, now called Information Technology Services. Throughout his career as a sociologist, he also worked as a computer consultant developing applications for many educational, governmental and business organizations. Many of publications by Anderson (125 articles, 4 books authored, and 5 books edited) describe and critique the use of computers and new media in research, teaching, and learning. He also (with David Garson) has served as Co-Editor of the Sage Publishing academic journal, Social Science Computer Review, since 1987.
Simulation Modeling.
Ronald Anderson pioneered the development of two major simulation models. The first provides scenario-based analysis of the impacts of changing sentencing laws. This work started in 1979 for the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission and the Department of Corrections (MDOC). It consisted of a model of the effects of hypothetical changes in sentencing laws upon prison and probation populations. The model, now called the Structured Sentencing Simulation, is still used by [Minnesota and Carolina in prison population projections and “what if” scenario simulations.
His second major simulation work, between 2009 and 2012, addresses college student retention. He and demographer, Dr. Martin Spielauer, developed a computer model called MicroCC. It was developed under a grant from the Science Foundation, and has been applied to 250,000 community college students in New England.
Educational Software.
During the 1970s and 80s, Anderson pioneered educational software applications for social science teaching and research. He developed over 50 applications that were distributed by Random House, Longman Publishing, and Control Data Corporation. Some of the more popular titles include Social Indicators Game,
The Public Opinion Exercise: American Sexual Values and Social Power Game. The latter game received the NCRIPTAL/EDUCOM Higher Education Distinguished Software Award in 1987.
Lectures on New Media in Education.
Principally during the 1980s and 1990s, Anderson gave invited lectures on using new media, which includes educational technology and instructional technology, to teachers and administrators in both secondary and postsecondary institutions as well as national educational organizations. The latter included the Ministry of Education (Singapore), Japan’s National Institute for Educational Policy Research, and the Ministry of Education and Research (Norway). Within the United States, his lectures included the National Academy of Sciences, Eastern Montana College, University of Akron, University of Dayton, Ball State University, and Eastern Michigan University.
Social Implications of Technology.
During the 1970s, Professor Anderson published a number of articles on the ways in which the social context of computing shaped its use and development. In his writing on the social aspects and implications of computing, he persistently emphasized the need for research data for making decisions about the implementation of computer technology. The ACM Digital Library contains 33 articles by Anderson with a total of 982 citations and 617 downloads in 2012 alone.
With funding from the National Science Foundation to the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, Ron Anderson and Dan Klassen conducted the first large-scale survey, which surveyed the nearly 7,000 Minnesota high school teachers of math and science regarding their use of computers in teaching. They found that in 1978, before the release of the PC, half of the teachers used computers in their classes and the social context and social attributes of the teachers determined computer utilization.
In 1982, then U.S. Congressman Al Gore invited Anderson to participate in the “Computers and Education Hearings” of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the House Science and Technology Committee in Washington, D.C., on September 29, 1983. The full Statement of Dr. Ronald E. Anderson before the Subcommittee can be downloaded from the ACM Digital Library.
The statement emphasized differences in the implementation of computer utilization in schools based upon social and demographic factors, and the need for local and national evidence-based accountability.
In 1980, Anderson became the founding Chair of the Section of the American Sociological Association that is now called “Communication and Information Technologies” (CITASA) Barry Wellman describes Anderson’s organizing role as a stalwart of the technology movement within sociology.
In 1992, Anderson under the auspices of the ACM organized a conference on “Computers and the Quality of Life,” the first conference to link IT with quality of life issues. The Conference Proceedings is still downloadable at the ACM Digital Library and was downloaded 414 times in 2012.
In 2000, the Association for Computing Machinery Council appointed Anderson to represent ACM and the United States on the 30-nation Technical Committee (TC9) on “Relationship between Computers and Society” of the International Federation of Information Processing Societies (IFIPS). He served in that capacity for five years. The principal products of this international Committee during that time was to hold two symposia and collectively author a book entitled Perspectives and Policies on ICT in Society, which was published by Springer in 2007.
Code of Ethics for the Computing Professions.
During the 1980s, Anderson held several leadership positions in the for Computing Machinery (ACM), the principle association of computer scientists and computing professionals. He served as a Council member as well as Chair of the Special Interest Group on Computers and Society (SIGCAS) [His most important achievement within ACM was to chair the Working Group that developed the new ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. It was officially published in 1992 and remains the official ACM Code of Ethics. The ACM Digital Library Guide lists 2,393 citations of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct in the literature since 1992.
Following the publication of the new ACM Code of Ethics, Anderson wrote and published several articles on the ethics of computer work including an article on ethics for digital government. Pavlichev and Garson described his work as embodying the moral imperatives that are needed in the age of e-Government.
Social Dynamics of Technology in Teaching and Learning.
In 1992, coordinated by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), nearly 20 countries simultaneously surveyed (1) schools about the installed base of technology for K-12 instruction, (2) teacher practices for integrating technology into their teaching, and (3) students skills in using computers. Anderson directed the United States portion of the study.
Not only was this the first international assessment of ICT in school-based learning, but it was the first such study in the United States. The key findings were that school computers were more outdated in the USA than in most other countries in the study and the diffusion of computer augmented learning tended to be less prevalent in lower income school districts and in highly rural areas. These results, with lengthy quotes from Anderson, who directed the US portion of the study, were widely disseminated in the popular media including articles in USA Today, and Education Week. and many others.
Six years later in 1998, Ron Anderson (with Henry J. Becker) conducted another national survey of schools and teachers: Teaching, Learning and Computing.
The project produced 16 reports that were widely circulated. The principal findings of the study were that teacher professional identities, constructivist pedagogy, and instructionally oriented technology support were key factors in effective use of computers in teaching.
Second International Technology in Education Study (SITES).
Beginning in 1997, Dr. Anderson Co-Chaired the International Steering Committee for the first two modules of the IEA’s Second International Technology in Education Study (SITES). Anderson continued with the SITES 2006 Study until 2007 when it ended.
In 2000, Ron Anderson and Sara Dexter, directed a large national study funded by the U.S. Department of Education, "Exemplary Technology-Supported-Schooling Case Studies," a project providing for the United States participation in both the IEA SITES Module 2 and the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) "case studies of reform and innovation using information technology in learning." The results of this large study of innovative exemplars of teaching with technology for the United States can be found online.
Contribution to Theories on the Social Dynamics of Technology.
Ron Anderson has contributed to theories on the sociology of educational technology, especially in the areas of Diffusion of Innovations and application of Information Society concepts. In 1976, he published results about the diffusion of computer utilization among sociologists and in 1979 about secondary mathematics and science teachers. The former study found that while the time of adoption of computers in teaching followed an S-shaped curve as predicted by diffusion theory, the majority of applications used were not particularly innovative. In the latter study, he found that technology resources and social factors were about equally powerful in explaining adoption of technology in teaching. More interesting, however, in terms of theory was the finding that a substantial number of teachers had discontinued their use of the innovation, an aspect of the theory not yet developed.
A second area of theoretical contribution was that of theories of the information society, of which the concept of “knowledge society” is an extension. While Anderson began in the 1990s, applying information economy and knowledge management concepts to theories of what students would need in the 21st Century, his most extensive analysis was published in 2008. Anderson introduced the concepts of tacit knowledge and tacit knowledge demand to pedagogical reform with technology. His original notions of the information society paradigm are generally accepted among those concerned with defining 21st Century Skills. The acceptance of the concept of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is a case in point.
Evaluation Research.
Anderson frequently received consulting requests to evaluate educational interventions and conduct research, especially with regard to the role of technology in teaching. Numerous clients include: Data Corporation, Corporation, the States Department of Education, and the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong. For example, he reviewed test items and research designs for the Australian Center for Educational Research helping them administer the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) project. In 2004 he spent two weeks working with the for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology in Thailand reviewing their IT-related projects and research needs. He also has worked with several SRI International projects, funded by the [National Science Foundation to develop performance assessments and surveys related ion the use of Information and communication technologies in education by both teachers and students.
Expert Witness.
On several occasions, Anderson was asked to serve as an expert witness on issues related to survey research. From 2003 to 2005, he served as an expert witness for Mahoney & Foster, Ltd on an advertising fraud case. His role included the conduct a survey of consumers of deer hunting products and critiquing the research quality of other surveys conducted.
Anderson also served as an expert witness on several Change of venue hearings. One was the trial of Marjorie Congdon Caldwell Hagen for the 1977 murder of Elisabeth Congdon and her nurse in her Glensheen Historic Estate. Another change of venue hearing in which he testified was a murder trial in which William Kunstler was involved. The hearing occurred on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 1978.
Major Books.
The WorldCat Identities three of Anderson’s books as held by over 400 WorldCat member libraries worldwide. The three books are: Computer Literacy, Academic Press, 1982; Computer Applications in the Social Sciences, (with Edward Brent) NY: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1990; with T. Plomp, N. Law, & A. Quale) Cross-National Policies and Practices on Information and Communication Technology in Education. Greenwich, CT, USA: Information Age Publishing, 2009, which was reviewed by Bhasin.
In addition, Anderson (with David Sullivan) authored the college textbook World of Computing (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin, 1988), which was adopted by an estimated 660 college classrooms. Among his other authored books were: ICT and the Emerging Paradigm for Life Long Learning: A Worldwide Educational Assessment of Infrastructure, Goals and Practices, (with W. Pelgrum), which was published by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement in 2001 and is available at: and Assessing Com¬puter Literacy, Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1982. Coiro, Knobel, Lankshear & Leu note that this original work on measuring computing from the standpoint of literacy was a ground-breaking direction in educational research.
Recent Research.
Beginning in about 2007, Professor Anderson decided he could contribute to the common good by addressing larger societal issues rather than technology alone. He established the nonprofit Foundation for Compassionate Societies, Inc. to develop and promoted the website CompassionateSocieties.org, and proceeded to develop a taxonomy of compassion and caring oriented websites. His first paper on this research was published in 2012 and included a network analysis of key caring-oriented websites.
A second thread of this compassion-oriented research concentrated on finding indicators of compassion and caring at the societal level, leading to a measure or Index of Good Societies. This in turn led to the development of a measure of subjective suffering also at societal levels. A research report on world suffering, compares 123 countries on suffering, taking into account religion and social support. Ironically, after 43 years he has returned to his creativity with secondary data that launched his academic career in 1969.

Sing the Delta

Sing The Delta is the fifth album by country and folk singer, Iris DeMent. The album, released on 2 October 2012 via Flariella Records, comprises DeMent's first original material in sixteen years.
Background.
The album's material has strong ties to DeMent's upbringing. According to DeMent, "Sing the Delta" is a reference to the Arkansas Delta, a natural region in the State of Arkansas and where her family lives. She says of the title track: "And that was that part of the country, the Arkansas Delta. ... A lot of what I had stamped on me — musically, Sunday-dinner-wise, religion and everything else — was a direct outgrowth of that." 
Commenting on the sixteen-year wait between new material, DeMent has stated in an interview that she has come to terms with the fact she doesn't write new songs very often. "I finally made peace with that. It took me a long time, but I finally have fully accepted I’m not in charge of that. So I just made the decision to live my life." In another interview, when asked what she had been doing in the sixteen years since her previous album, she quipped "I painted the living room a lot of different colors."
Critical reception.
"Sing the Delta" has largely received a positive response. Rolling Stone notes: "...these artisanal songs of love and doubt wear their homeliness proudly; the effect is like finding a bountiful farm stand in the middle of nowhere." Stuart Munro from the Boston Globe calls the album:" a work of rare, unvarnished grace and power". The UK's The Guardian Newspaper wrote that the album:"sounds as powerful and timeless as anything she has done". In addition, the review praised the quality of DeMent's songwriting. 
AllMusic praised DeMent's voice, saying: "She's a careful, detailed songwriter with a confessional edge and a good sense of narrative, and her voice is a marvelous instrument that seems to rise out of the previous century". The review does, however, suggests that "Sing the Delta" is not an album that one can often sing along to. In another glowing review, Slant Magazine's Jonothan Keefe writes: "DeMent's fully invested performances are lived-in and soulful, heightening the intensity of the experiences she's singing about. Over the course of "Sing the Delta", DeMent confesses, wails, and testifies, and there's simply no one else in popular music who tells their truths with such urgency or clarity."

Dick Black (politician)

Richard H. "Dick" Black (born May 15, 1944) is a member of the Republican Party who has served in the Virginia Senate since 2012. Black was previously a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1998 to 2006.
Early career.
Before winning elective office several times, Black was a U.S. Marine Corps pilot, before going to law school, and becoming an Army Judge Advocate General Corps officer. As an Army JAG, Black was a military prosecutor. Black first held elective office on the Loudoun County Library Board, where in 1997 he authored a policy that blocked pornography on library computers because neighbors complained to him about the potential danger of their children nearby seeing the porn when in the library, and parents' concerns being ignored by library staff. To explain why the policy was necessary, Black invited a reporter to film him watching rape pornography on a library computer, showing the danger of nearby library users also seeing the porn. Librarians reported only receiving one complaint about their computers being used to view pornography - when Black did so, but several parents complaints caused Black to take the action he did. The policy drew national attention and first amendment litigation struck down the policy, costing the Board $100,000.
Politics.
Virginia House of Representatives.
He was first elected to the Virginia House in a special election in 1997 to succeed Republican Delegate Bill Mims, who had been elected to the Virginia Senate. During his election campaign, he said that rape in the military was "as predictable as human nature" and asked a reporter: "Think of yourself at 25. Wouldn't you love to have a group of 19-year-old girls under your control, day in, day out?" Black resigned from the Library Board a few months after being sworn-in. A "deeply conservative" delegate, Black became well-known for making inflammatory and controversial statements.
In 1998, he tried to pass a law to require doctors give anaesthetic to foetuses before late-term abortions and another that "tried to effectively ban gay people from adopting children in Virginia". In late 2000, in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre, Black proposed legislation that would require students to address their teachers as "Ma'am", "Sir", "Mr.", "Miss" or "Mrs.", saying that "The counterculture revolution of the '70s took the war into the classroom. Before that time, public schools were a model of decorum, and then we began this thing we've seen play out at Columbine." In February 2001, he voted to establish a 24-hour waiting period for women wanting abortions and called emergency contraception "baby pesticide". In February 2002, Black opposed making marital rape a crime, saying that it was impossible to convict a man "when they're living together, sleeping in the same bed, she's in a nightie, and so forth." In late 2002 and early 2003, Black opposed erecting a statue of Abraham Lincoln and his son Thomas at the Tredegar Iron Works to commemorate Lincoln's visit to Richmond on April 4, 1865, 10 days before his assassination. Black said, "Putting a statue to there is sort of like putting the Confederate flag at 
the Lincoln Memorial."
In July 2003, Black proposed legislation that would prevent unmarried and gay couples from applying for low-interest home mortgages, saying that the state was "spending $90 million to subsidize sodomy and adultery. I just don’t understand why we are taking money away worthwhile programs and supporting a radical homosexual agenda." Also in 2003, he handed out plastic foetuses to fellow delegates before votes on abortion issues. He also once remarked that abortion was "a greater evil than segregation or slavery" and in 2005 he authored a bill that would require abortion providers to wrongly tell women that foetuses being aborted after 20 weeks could feel pain. Also in 2005, he resurrected his legislation that would ban gay people from adopting children, claiming that gay people were more prone to violence, alcoholism, and suicide. He then amended the bill to require that adoption agencies investigate whether people looking to adopt children were "known to engage in current voluntary homosexual activity". In February of that year, he urged his constituents to picket Stone Bridge High School for putting on a play about a gay football player, claiming that the school was "being used to promote a homosexual lifestyle." He further claimed that attempts to "encourage homosexual activity, to portray it in a cute or favorable light" could lead to children contracting HIV. In 2004, he said with regard to Virginia's sodomy law: "If I'm the last person on the face of this Earth to vote against legalizing sodomy, I'll do it."
Defeat and 2007 Congressional election.
He was defeated in his quest for a fifth term by Democrat David Poisson in 2005. Poisson defeated him 53%–47%. Black ran for the Republican nomination in the special election for Virginia's 1st congressional district in October 2007. A convention was held to determine the nominee and Black came fifth, eliminated in the fourth ballot. State Delegate Rob Wittman was picked and went on to win the election.
Virginia Senate.
Black ran for the State Senate in 2013, in the 13th district to succeed the retiring Republican incumbent Fred Quayle. He moved residence from the 33rd district, believing that the incumbent Democrat, Mark Herring, was too difficult an opponent. Black narrowly won the primary, taking 3,143 votes (38.83%) to John Stirrup's 3,029 votes (37.42%) and Robert S. Fitzsimmonds' 1,923 votes (23.76%). In the general election, Black defeated Democrat Shawn Mitchell by 57% to 43%.
In an interview in December 2013, Black compared same-sex marriage to polygamy and incest, saying that although he opposed polygamy, "at least it functions biologically", adding that it was "just more natural" than homosexuality.
In 2014, Black briefly ran for Virginia's 10th congressional district in the 2014 elections to succeed retiring Republican incumbent Frank Wolf. He withdrew on January 23, 2 days after declaring his candidacy, saying: "after meeting with Republican Caucus leaders in Richmond, it is imperative that I remain in the Senate where I am needed to maintain our 20/20 split." Although the Virginia Senate is split 20/20, Democrats hold the majority as Ralph Northam, the Democratic Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, casts tie-breaking votes.
Assad Letter.
In April 2014 Black sent an official letter to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, thanking "the Syrian Arab Army for it's heroic rescue of Christians in the Qalamoun Mountain Range," and praising Assad for "treating with respect all Christians and the small community of Jews in Damascus." In an interview with Politico, Black compared events in the Syrian Civil War to a movie. Democratic Virginia Senator A. Donald McEachin called the letter "bizarre". Republican Senator Bill Stanley later joked "What’s the matter, Dick? Was Kim Jong-un not returning your text messages?".

The music director was Shiv-Hari, both also noted classical musicians. The taal (rhythm) of the song is "Keherwa" ("Kaharva") of Hindustani classical music, while the lyrics were by poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, based on a traditional bhajan, by 15th-century mystic poet Meera.
The song was picturised in a film sequence showing a community Holi celebration with film's cast, and hence got link with Holi festivities. Even after three decades of its release, 'Rang Barse' is remains one of the most popular song played on the occasion of festival Holi in north India.

Turkmenistani parliamentary election, 2013

Parliamentary elections were held in Turkmenistan on 15 December 2013. Although they were the first multi-party elections in the country's history, both contesting parties claimed loyalty to President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. The ruling Democratic Party emerged as the largest faction in the Assembly with 47 of the 125 seats, losing its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence. The elections were criticized by the OSCE, Amnesty International, and opposition groups such as the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights. Farid Tukhbatulin of the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights said that there was little difference between the two major parties, arguing that neither truly represented opposition groups.
Background.
A new law on political parties was adopted in January 2012, with the government claiming it would make it easier for new parties to be formed to challenge the ruling Democratic Party. Subsequently the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs was established in August 2012.
Campaign.
A total of 283 candidates registered to contest the 125 seats in the Assembly. The Democratic Party put forward 99 candidates, the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs nominated 28 candidates, whilst a further 163 were fielded by groups including a women's union, trade unions and a youth union.

Fort Saumarez

Fort Saumarez is a Martello tower in Saint Peter, Guernsey, on a headland that forms the northern tip of L'Erée and extends to the Lihou causeway. It was constructed in 1804 on the site of an existing battery after the onset of the Napoleonic Wars, and during the tenure (1803-1813) of Lieutenant Governor General Sir John Doyle. Doyle named the tower for the Guernsey native and renowned Royal Navy Captain, Sir James Saumarez, who at the time was commander of British naval forces in the Channel Islands. To simplify matters, Doyle had a local builder named Gray construct the tower, and two others, see below, under the rubric of "fieldworks", thereby bypassing the Ordnance Corps. 
The Fort Saumarez tower, like the other two Guernsey Martello towers, Fort Grey and Fort Hommet, was intended as a keep for the battery in which it was placed. The Guernsey Martellos are smaller than the British towers, with the Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet towers being smaller than the Fort Grey tower. Each mounted a 24-pounder carronade on the roof to protect the battery. Fort Saumarez and Fort Hommet also have exterior staircases up to the second floor. 
Doyle was responsible for substantial fortification efforts elsewhere in Guernsey, including the construction of the two other Martello towers. Because of its location, Fort Saumarez also served as one of six to ten optical telegraph stations that ringed the coast to give warning of approaching vessels. 
In 1852, the battery at Fort Saumarez received 32-pounder guns and 8" shell guns in place of some of its 24-pounder guns. 
During World War II and the German occupation of the Channel Islands, the Germans recognized the enduring utility of the site and built a four-storey concrete observation tower on top of the fort. At some point the battery around the Fort Saumarez tower was demolished. Fort Saumarez is now privately owned and not publicly accessible.

Conchita Wurst

Thomas "Tom" Neuwirth (born 6 November 1988), better known by his drag stage persona Conchita Wurst, is an Austrian singer. Wurst came to international attention when winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark with the song "Rise Like a Phoenix".
Born in Gmunden, Neuwirth studied fashion before embarking on a singing career through the 2007 casting show "Starmania". He subsequently became a founding member of the short-lived boyband Jetzt Anders!. In 2011, Neuwirth began appearing as Wurst – a drag persona noted for her beard – and came second in the Austrian preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. Wurst was successfully selected to represent Austria at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014, where she proved victorious. Wurst's entry and victory courted controversy, being condemned by some of the continent's social conservatives and right-wingers who saw her performance as a promotion of LGBT rights.
Neuwirth describes himself as a gay man and uses female pronouns to describe his Wurst character, but male pronouns when referring to himself.
Early life.
Youth: 1988–2005.
Tom Neuwirth was born on 6 November 1988 in Gmunden, before being raised in the small town of Bad Mitterndorf, amid the Styrian countryside. He has stated that the mountainous area was a wonderful place to grow up, but that he faced prejudice for being homosexual: "Being a teenager, a gay teenager, in such a small village is not that much fun. I am part of the gay community and most gays have a similar story to mine." From an early age he recognised that he was different from other children, initially believing that this was because there was "something wrong" with him. He occasionally wore a skirt to kindergarten and then school, although subsequently felt that he could only be happy doing so in the attic of his home. 
Aged 14, Neuwirth moved to Graz in order to study fashion design.
Early musical career: 2006–13.
In 2006, Neuwirth took part in the third edition of the Austrian TV show "Starmania", finishing in second place (Nadine Beiler placed first). One year later, Neuwirth founded the boyband Jetzt Anders!, but the group disbanded during the same year.
It was after this that Neuwirth developed the persona of Conchita Wurst, a bearded woman. In the German language, "Wurst" means "sausage", although Neuwirth relates the choice of last name to the common German expression "Das ist mir doch alles Wurst", which translates as "it's all the same to me", and "I don't care", stating that the name emerged from the first meaning of that expression. The name "Conchita" meanwhile had been adopted from a Cuban friend of his. Neuwirth asserted that the inclusion of the beard as part of the Wurst character was "a statement to say that you can achieve anything, no matter who you are or how you look." The inclusion of a beard as part of the drag look was not unique, having been pioneered in the 1970s by The Cockettes in San Francisco and the Bloolips in London. Neuwirth clarified that he is not transgender, and is instead a gay man; he uses female pronouns to describe his Wurst character, but male pronouns when referring to himself. Nevertheless the artificial character of Conchita Wurst is married in a fictional liaison to a fellow French man Jacques Patriaque, calling himself Austria's first Boylesque artist and festival organizer. He, also, is bearded.
Wurst's first appearance was on ORF's show "Die große Chance" in 2011, where she achieved 6th place. In 2012, she competed in the Austrian National Final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 and came second. Wurst then appeared in the ORF show "The Hardest Jobs of Austria", working in a fish processing plant, and in "Wild Girls", in which a group of candidates had to survive in the deserts of Namibia together with native tribes.
2014 Eurovision Song Contest.
Selection.
On 10 September 2013, Austrian national broadcaster ORF announced that it had selected Wurst to represent Austria at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014, to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark in May 2014. In March 2014, Wurst's song was revealed as "Rise Like a Phoenix", with bookmakers placing her entry in the top ten favourites to win that year's contest. Despite Eurovision's reputation for campness, Wurst's performance was designed to be serious and in good taste, and she was one of the only performers to appear onstage alone. Although individuals who identified as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) had appeared on Eurovision before – most notable Israel's Dana International, who won in 1998 – Wurst's appearance was described by "The New Statesman" as the "most genderqueer yet".
Conchita's selection proved controversial and attracted criticism from conservative groups, particularly in Eastern Europe, thus highlighting the continent's regional divide between east and west on the issue of homosexuality. In Austria, four days after ORF announced its decision, more than 31,000 people liked an "Anti-Wurst" Facebook page. Petitions emerged in Russia and Belarus calling for their respective national broadcasters to edit out Wurst's performance from the televised contest; the Russian petition asserted that Eurovision had become "a hotbed of sodomy, at the initiation of European liberals." Conservative Russian politician Vitaly Milonov urged Russia's Eurovision selection committee to boycott the competition as a result of Wurst's inclusion, describing her performance as "blatant propaganda of homosexuality and spiritual decay" and referring to her as the "pervert from Austria". Armenia's entry for the contest, Aram Mp3, stated that Neuwirth's lifestyle was "not natural" and that he should decide whether he was a man or woman. Neuwirth hit back, commenting "I told him I don't want to be a woman. I am just a working queen and a very lazy boy at home." Aram subsequently apologised, stating that his prior comments had been intended as a joke.
Reacting to these sentiments, the "New Statesman" commented that "a vote for Wurst is another vote against Russian homophobia and transphobia, and a win would send out a strong message of defiance eastwards", while the "International Business Times" called on readers to vote for Wurst to upset homophobes.
Highlighting statements such as these as evidence, "Spiked" declared that many Western European commentators and politicos had adopted Wurst as "a symbol of everything that makes Western Europe superior to the East" and that she had thus become part of a culture war against both Russia and "the so-called bigots and backward types" in their own nations.
Victory.
At the second semi-final on 8 May, Neuwirth, as Conchita, qualified for the final on 10 May. At the finals held in Copenhagen on 10 May 2014, she won the competition with 290 points. This was Austria's first Eurovision win since Eurovision 1966.
Wurst's entry gained high scores from Western European countries as well as some in the East, such as Georgia and Ukraine. However, the levels of support for Wurst varied across Europe; on average she received 4.4 points out of 12 from the nations of the former Soviet Union (excluding those in the Baltic), 6 points from the other three ex-socialist states, and 10.5 points from Western Europe, Scandinavia, Greece, and Israel. Commenting on this, political analyist Alan Renwick of Reading University asserted that "Even in those countries where the ruling elites are often highly intolerant, the wider population might be readier to accept that different people might be different."
Upon being awarded the trophy, Wurst held it aloft and proclaimed "We are unity and we are unstoppable". She later confirmed to reporters that this was a message meant for politicians who opposed LGBT rights, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.
International response.
Britain's "Daily Mail" declared that Wurst's victory had made her a "global superstar". On returning to Austria, she was greeted at the airport by a crowd of over 1000 cheering fans, many wearing fake beards and singing "Rise Like a Phoenix". To journalists, she expanded on the message of tolerance which she had championed at Eurovision: "It was not just a victory for me but a victory for those people who believe in a future that can function without discrimination and is based on tolerance and respect."
Austrian President Heinz Fischer asserted that it was "not just a victory for Austria, but above all for diversity and tolerance in Europe". A local radio station celebrated by playing "Rise Like a Phoenix" on a loop 48 times over four hours. The UK's Eurovision commentator Graham Norton commented on the socio-political significance of Wurst's victory: "it seems like Eurovision has done something that matters just a little bit".
Following her victory, Wurst became an icon for Europe's LGBT community. Vienna's tourist board hoped to use Wurst to encourage more gay holidaymakers to visit the city, using her image on the Facebook page "Gayfriendly Vienna". "The Week" stated that she had become "a serious figure of hope" for some LGBT people living "under the shadow of officially-sanctioned intolerance" in various European countries, while British trans activist Paris Lees commented that across Europe she inspired "millions of people" and stood up for "everyone who has ever been made to feel ashamed or afraid for being different." In Russia, "Rise Like a Phoenix" topped the internet download chart two days after the competition.
Fans of Wurst and LGBT rights activists applied to hold a Conchita Wurst March of Bearded Women and Men through Moscow on 27 May, a date commemorating the 21st anniversary since the legalisation of same-sex sexual activity in the country. Officials from the city's security department rejected the request, citing a wish to "respect morality in the education of the younger generation" and to prevent violent clashes between marchers and anti-gay demonstrators. LGBT rights groups in Serbia and Croatia criticised the tone with which their national broadcasters referred to Wurst, deeming it offensive and homophobic; Serbia's RTS subsequently issued a letter of apology.
Criticism continued to be made following Conchita's victory. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin posted on Twitter that the result "showed supporters of European integration their European future: a bearded girl."
Another Russian politician, the ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, proclaimed "There's no limit to our outrage. It's the end of Europe", later adding that "Fifty years ago the Soviet army occupied Austria. We made a mistake in freeing Austria. We should have stayed." These opinions from officials contradicted the public voting of the Russian Eurovision voters who placed Conchita Wurst third in the Russian phone vote. The Russian Orthodox Church condemned Wurst's victory, with Vladimir Legoyda, chairman of the church's information department, describing it as "yet one more step in the rejection of the Christian identity of European culture", reflecting an attempt to "reinforce new cultural norms". A social media campaign involved Russian men shaving off their beards in protest at Wurst's victory; those taking part included broadcaster Andrey Malakhov and rapper Aleksander Stepanov (a.k.a. ST).
Several church leaders in the Balkans asserted that the May 2014 flooding in the region was "divine punishment" from God for Wurst's victory. Reacting to these critics, Wurst stated "It's so ridiculous! For me a perfect world would be when we don't have to talk about sexuality, where you're from, what you believe. Is this the worst thing in the mind of the politicians?" She stated her desire to perform in Russia for the country's LGBT community, "To tell them that they are not alone. The whole community around the world is standing behind them. They have to trust that if they open their mouth, then we can change something."

Noah (2014 film)

Noah is a 2014 American epic biblically inspired film directed by Darren Aronofsky, written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel, and based loosely on the story of Noah's Ark. The film stars Russell Crowe as Noah along with Jennifer Connelly, Ray Winstone, Emma Watson, Logan Lerman and Anthony Hopkins. The film was released in North American theaters on March 28, 2014 in 2D and IMAX while several countries released a version of the film converted to 3D and IMAX 3D.
"Noah" received positive reviews from critics. It grossed over $359 million worldwide.
Plot.
As a young boy, Noah (Russell Crowe) witnesses his father, Lamech (Marton Csokas), killed by Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone). Many years later, Noah is living with his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) and their sons Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman), and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll), but after seeing a flower grow instantly from the ground and haunted by vivid dreams of a great flood, Noah takes them to visit his grandfather, Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins).
On the way, they come upon a group of people recently killed, and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila (Emma Watson). Noah and his family are chased by Tubal-Cain's men, but seek refuge with the fallen angels known as the 'Watchers', confined on Earth as stone golems for helping humans banished from the Garden of Eden. Methuselah gives Noah a seed derived from Eden, from which an entire forest grows within seconds, whose trees Noah's family and the watchers cut to build Noah's Ark. As the Ark nears completion, animals of various species enter the ark and are put to sleep by incense. 
With Ila having become enamored of Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth, but upon witnessing cannibalism by a starving mob, he abandons his effort. Thereafter Methuselah cures Ila of sterility. Ham, searching for a wife on his own behalf, acquires the refugee Na'el (Madison Davenport), but when Tubal-Cain's followers attack the Ark, Noah forces Ham to save himself and leave Na'el to die. All of Noah's family enter the Ark except Methuselah, who remains behind purposely. As the deluge begins, the Watchers sacrifice themselves to protect the Ark from the mob, and themselves ascend to Heaven. As the flood drowns the remaining soldiers, Tubal-Cain climbs onto the Ark and solicits Ham, playing on anger toward Noah for allowing Na'el to die. Ila becomes pregnant as rains stop, but Noah, against his wife's dissuasions, resolves that if the child is a girl, he will kill her to satisfy the Creator's wish to destroy humanity.
Months pass, and Ila and Shem build a small raft to escape Noah's resolve, but Noah burns it after discovering it. Afterwards, Ila gives birth to twin girls. Meanwhile, Tubal-Cain convinces Ham to help kill Noah, who is therefore attacked by Tubal-Cain, Ham, and Shem. As they fight, the Ark hits a mountain, and Ham kills Tubal-Cain. Noah seizes Ila's twins, but spares them upon perceiving innocence. Upon exiting the ark, Noah goes into isolation in a nearby cave and starts to drink wine. Afterwards he is discovered by his sons, nude and drunk. Having reconciled, at the behest of Ila, with all but Ham (who departs alone), Noah blesses the family as the beginning of a new human race, and witness an immense rainbow.
Production.
Development.
Aronofsky first got interested in the story of Noah in the seventh grade. As part of a creative writing assignment he submitted a poem about Noah entitled "The Dove". Years later after finishing the movie "Pi", Aronofsky was searching for ideas for his next movie and thought that a movie about Noah would be a good idea. Work on the script began in 2000 but Aronofsky put the project on hold when he learned Hallmark was already working on a similar movie. Work on the draft resumed sometime later with a first draft being completed in 2003.
In adapting to story for a feature film Aronofsky struggled with how to adapt it to feature length—the story in the Bible is only four chapters and doesn't include names for his wife or his sons' wives. The text does mention Noah getting drunk after the flood and getting into an altercation with one of his sons, which provided Aronofsky and his team with clues into what events took place on the Ark.
Aronofsky first discussed "Noah" with "The Guardian" in April 2007, Aronofsky explained that he saw Noah as "a dark, complicated character" who experiences "real survivor's guilt" after the flood. Aronofsky was working on early drafts of the script for "Noah" around the time his first attempt to make "The Fountain" fell through when actor Brad Pitt left the project.
Ari Handel—Aronofsky's collaborator on "The Fountain", "The Wrestler" and "Black Swan"—helped Aronofsky develop the script. Before they found financial backing for "Noah", they collaborated with Canadian artist Niko Henrichon to adapt the script into a graphic novel. The first volume of the graphic novel was released in the French language by Belgian publisher Le Lombard in October 2011 under the title "Noé: Pour la cruauté des hommes" ("Noah: For the Cruelty of Men"). After the creation of the graphic novel, Aronofsky struck a deal with Paramount and New Regency to produce a feature film of "Noah" with a budget of $130 million. Screenwriter John Logan was called in to re-draft the script alongside Aronofsky, but is not credited for his contributions.
In October 2012, Emma Watson commented on the setting of the film: "I think what Darren's going for is a sense that it could be set in any time. It could be set sort of like a thousand years in the future or a thousand years in the past. ... You shouldn't be able to place it too much."
Casting.
Aronofsky had previously offered the role of Noah to Christian Bale and Michael Fassbender, both of whom were unable to take the part due to previous commitments. Bale went on to star as Moses in Ridley Scott's upcoming religious epic film "".
Dakota Fanning was originally cast in the role of Ila, but departed due to a scheduling conflict.
Julianne Moore was also considered for the role of Naameh.
Liam Neeson, Liev Schreiber and Val Kilmer were also considered for the part of Tubal-cain. Aronofsky reportedly wanted an actor "with the grit and size to be convincing as he goes head-to-head against Crowe's Noah character".
Filming.
Principal photography began in July 2012, in Dyrhólaey, Fossvogur, Reynisfjara and other locations in Southern Iceland.
Filming also took place in New York state. A set representing Noah's Ark was built at the Planting Fields Arboretum in Upper Brookville, New York. In September 2012, while on break from a location on Long Island, Russell Crowe and a friend, both of whom had been kayaking for several hours, were rescued by the Coast Guard near Cold Spring Harbor. Production was put on hold while Hurricane Sandy subjected New York to heavy rain and flooding during late October 2012.
Post-production.
Post-production lasted over 14 months, with Aronofsky attempting some of the most complicated and extensive effects ever used in film. Industrial Light and Magic said their work on the film represented "the most complicated rendering in the company's history."
Regarding the film's extensive use of visual effects, Aronofsky said he and his crew "had to create an entire animal kingdom," using no real animals in the production but instead "slightly tweaked" versions of real creatures. Besides the fictional land-based animals in the film, ILM was also responsible for creating the Watchers, the forest that sprouted from the seed, the deluge sequence during the battle between the Watchers and Tubal-cain and his army, and the two-minute long sequence of the history of Earth's creation. The birds were created by Look Effects.
Music.
The musical score for "Noah" was composed by Clint Mansell, who scored the music for all of Aronofsky's previous feature films, and is performed by Kronos Quartet. A soundtrack album was released by Nonesuch Records on March 26, 2014.
The score also features an original song by Patti Smith, which is a lullaby sung by both Russell Crowe and Emma Watson's characters during the film. Smith performs the song herself over the end credits.
Themes.
The president of the National Religious Broadcasters stated that the "Noah" film includes "major biblical themes" including "sin, judgment, righteousness, and God as Creator." In addition, the film promotes the concept of evolutionary creation. Ari Handel, the scriptwriter for the "Noah" film stated that “The story of Noah starts with this concept of strong justice, that the wickedness of man will soon be met with justice, and it ends when the rainbow comes and it says, even though the heart of man is filled with wickedness, I will never again destroy the world... So it ends with this idea of mercy. God somehow goes from this idea of judging the wickedness to mercy and grace. So we decided that was a powerful and emotional arc to go through, and we decided to give that arc to Noah.” Commenting on God's mercy, Wesley Hill in "First Things" notes that "near the end of the film, Emma Watson’s character, Ila...says to Noah that perhaps God preserved him because God knew that he had a merciful heart", "the film ends up locating the rationale for God’s mercy in some native spark of goodness in Noah that will, viewers hope, make the new, post-flood world more livable than the antediluvian one."
Test screenings.
During the summer of 2013, Aronofsky and Paramount began sparring over final cut, with Paramount seeking to test unfinished, unscored, and alternate cuts of the film despite Aronofsky's objections. Paramount proceeded with the test-screenings nonetheless, prompting "Worrisome" responses from largely religious audiences at test screenings in October 2013. "They tried what they wanted to try, and eventually they came back. My version of the film hasn't been tested... It's what we wrote and what was green lighted." After much discussion and compromise, the studio announced on February 12 that Darren Aronofsky's version, not any of the studio's alternate versions, would be the final cut of Noah.
Under pressure from Christian religious groups, Paramount Pictures added a disclaimer to marketing materials in February 2014, saying:
"The film is inspired by the story of Noah. While artistic license has been taken, we believe that this film is true to the essence, values and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide. The biblical story of Noah can be found in the book of Genesis."
Reception.
Release and box office.
The film had its world premiere in Mexico City on March 10, 2014. In North America, the film grossed a little over $43.7 million during its opening box office weekend, becoming Aronofsky's highest opening weekend and his first film to open at No. 1. The opening weekend was also the biggest ever for Russell Crowe in his starring career.
Overseas, the film's releases in Russia and Brazil were the largest ever for a non-sequel, and were the fourth biggest openings of all time with $17.2 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The opening in Russia was the largest ever for a Paramount film. In South Korea, the film grossed $1.1 million on its opening day - the highest in 2014 for the territory.
The film grossed $101,200,044 in North America and $258,000,000 in other countries, making an international gross of $359,200,044. The film was declared "an unmitigated hit... by almost every measure." 
Events.
In connection with the release of the film in North America, Aronofsky commissioned over fifty living artists to create original works inspired by the biblical story of Noah, stating that "The Noah story belongs to all of us- every religion, every culture, every citizen of planet Earth." The collection, titled "Fountains of the Deep: Visions of Noah and Flood" was open to the public for the month of March, 2014 in the Soho district of New York City. Contributing artists included Ugo Rondinone, Sue Williams, Karen Kilimnik, Mike Nelson, Nan Goldin, Jim Lee, Robert Liefeld, Jim Woodring, Simon Bisley, graffiti duo FAILE, James Jean, Ward Shelley, and many others.
On the eve of the film's release in Reykjavik, Iceland, Aronofsky teamed up with Bjork to host an environmental benefit concert in response to proposed anti-conservationist policy changes by the Icelandic government, with guest performances by Bjork, Patti Smith, Lykke Li, Russell Crowe and Monsters of Men.
Critical reception.
Kathleen Parker, writing in "The Washington Post", called the movie "Noah's Arc of Triumph" and said of the film: "If you like 'Braveheart,' 'Gladiator,' 'Star Wars,' 'The Lord of The Rings,' 'Indiana Jones,' or 'Titanic,' you will like 'Noah.' If you like two or more of the above, you will love 'Noah.'"
Richard Roeper called it "One of the most dazzling and unforgettable Biblical epics ever put on film."
The movie also had its detractors. IndieWire claimed "Aronofsky's worst movie is an epic misfire that, like the source material, offers plenty of lessons even if you don't buy the whole package." The Wrap called the film "Darren Aronofsky's Biblical "Waterworld"", "The New Yorker's" David Denby wrote: "Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah'- an epic farrago of tumultuous water, digital battle, and environmentalist rage... is the craziest big movie in years. 'Noah' may not make much sense, but only an artist could have made it.
Christian and Jewish response.
Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion, called the "Noah" film "interesting and thought-provoking" after the film's lead star, Russell Crowe traveled to the Lambeth Palace in order to discuss with him "faith and spirituality" after the movie's British premiere. In addition, several Christian organizations have expressed support for the "Noah" film, "including Leaders from organizations like the American Bible Society, National Catholic Register, The King's College, Q Ideas, Hollywood Prayer Network, and Focus on the Family." Focus on the Family president Jim Daly stated that: "["Noah"] is a creative interpretation of the scriptural account that allows us to imagine the deep struggles Noah may have wrestled with as he answered God’s call on his life. This cinematic vision of Noah’s story gives Christians a great opportunity to engage our culture with the biblical Noah, and to have conversations with friends and family about matters of eternal significance." Cultural commenter Fr. Robert Barron praised the film for its inclusion of "God, creation, providence, sin, obedience, salvation: not bad for a major Hollywood movie!" In addition, The Biologos Foundation stated that they "saw the importance of stories as explanations—my favorite part of the whole movie was when Noah retold the Genesis creation accounts to his sons, and we saw the evolutionary creation of the world up to some mysterious Adam and Eve figures."
Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an orthodox Jewish rabbi leader, hailed "Noah" as "a valuable film, especially for our times." In order to create "a story that tries to explicate Noah's relationship with God and God's relationship with the world as it has become", director of the film Darren Aronofsky himself stated that he was working in "the tradition of Jewish Midrash".
"Noah" has also been the subject of controversy with Christians who take issue with how the story has been portrayed. Ken Ham and Ray Comfort, both young earth creationists, objected to the film, with the latter apologist creating his own documentary, "Noah and the Last Days" as a response. The director angered many in the religious community by stating that his version of “Noah” as the “least biblical biblical film ever made.” Despite a few references to "The Creator", some still disliked the movie because God is not mentioned by name. Jerry Johnson, president of the National Religious Broadcasters, did not like the director’s description of Noah as the “first environmentalist”. Johnson called the film’s “insertion of the extremist environmental agenda” a major concern. 
Producer Scott Franklin told "Entertainment Weekly", ""Noah" is a very short section of the Bible with a lot of gaps, so we definitely had to take some creative expression in it. But I think we stayed very true to the story and didn't really deviate from the Bible, despite the six-armed angels." Kevin Hall, Ph.D., professor of biblical and theological studies and the Ida Elizabeth and J.W. Hollums chair of Bible at Oklahoma Baptist University agreed, expressing the idea that "the story in Genesis is extremely concise, so some creativity with the tale — especially by Hollywood — is hardly a surprise."
Muslim response and censorship.
The film was banned in Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and Indonesia prior to its release because it is seen by the governments of those countries as contradicting the teachings of Islam. A representative of Paramount Pictures confirmed the news by saying "Censors for Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE officially confirmed this week that the film will not release in their countries". The film was also disapproved by the Al-Azhar University in Egypt as it violates Islamic law and could "provoke the feelings of believers." Mohammad Zareef from Pakistan's Central Board of Film Censors said they tended to steer clear of films with a religious theme, adding: "We haven't seen it yet, but I don't think it can go to the cinemas in Pakistan." However, the DVD release will be available in Pakistan. In many Islamic juristic schools, the portrayal of prophets such as Noah is forbidden.
Home media.
Noah is set to be released on Blu-ray/DVD combo pack July 29.

Barry Barish

Barry C. Barish (born January 27, 1936) is an American experimental physicist. He is a Linde Professor of Physics, emeritus at California Institute of Technology. He is a leading expert on gravitational waves.
Birth and Education.
Barry C. Barish was born in Omaha, Nebraska, grew up in southern California, and attended high school in Los Angeles. He earned his B.A. in physics (1957) and his Ph.D. in experimental high energy physics (1962) at the University of California, Berkeley. He joined Caltech in 1963 as part of a new experimental effort in particle physics using frontier particle accelerators at the national laboratories.
Research.
Among Prof. Barish's noteworthy experiments were those performed at Fermilab using high-energy neutrino collisions to reveal the quark substructure of the nucleon. These experiments were among the first to observe the weak neutral current, a linchpin of the electroweak unification theories of Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg.
In the 1980s, Barish initiated an ambitious international effort to build a sophisticated underground detector to search for the magnetic monopole and solve other problems in the emerging area of particle astrophysics. Experiments conducted underground in the Gran Sasso Tunnel in Italy provided some of the key evidence that neutrinos have mass. In 1991, Barish was named the Maxine and Ronald Linde Professor of Physics at Caltech. In 1994, Prof. Barish became principal investigator of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project and served as Director of the LIGO Laboratory from 1997 to 2005, leading a team of scientists who have built two large facilities being used for detection and study of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources. The detectors are precision suspended mass laser interferometers that monitor motions of test masses separated by four kilometer baselines with a precision of 10–18 meter. The experiment has already set the best limits on most candidate sources at levels that are becoming astrophysically interesting. The interferometry technique works very well and a major upgrade is now underway to improve the sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude.
Barry Barish is former Director of the Design Effort for the International Linear Collider (ILC) and Linde Professor of Physics, Emeritus at the California Institute of Technology. The ILC is the highest priority future project for particle physics worldwide, as it promises to complement the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in exploring the TeV energy scale. This ambitious effort is being uniquely coordinated worldwide, representing a major step in international collaborations going from conception to design to implementation for large scale projects in physics.
From 2001 to 2002, Prof. Barish served as co-chair of the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel subpanel that developed a long-range plan for U.S. high energy physics. He has chaired the Commission of Particles and Fields and the U.S. Liaison committee to the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). In 2002 he chaired the NRC Board of Physics and Astronomy Neutrino Facilities Assessment Committee. Report "Neutrinos and Beyond".
Honors and Awards.
Barish has been elected to:
In 2002, he received the Klopsteg Award of the American Association of Physics Teachers. Prof. Barish was honored by the University of Bologna (2006) and University of Florida ( 2007) where he received honorary doctorates. In 2007, delivered the Van Vleck lectures at the University of Minnesota. The University of Glasgow honored Prof. Barish with an honorary degree of science in 2013.

Dansker

A dansker (also "danzker") is a toilet facility, belonging to a castle, that is housed in a tower over a river or stream. The tower, generally a so-called toilet tower (German: "Abortturm"), is linked to the castle over a bridge, which has a covered or enclosed walkway. The "dansker" is mainly found at German "ordensburgen" and is an architectural feature of the 13th and 14th centuries.
The origin of the word, first used in 1393, is probably the town of Danzig.
A famous example is the "dansker" at the "ordensburg" in Marienwerder, which was, however, rebuilt in the 19th century and no longer retains its medieval appearance.

Domingo Jironza Petriz de Cruzate

Domingo Jironza Pétriz de Cruzate (or Domingo Gironza) (b. circa 1640) was a Spanish soldier who was Governor of New Mexico from 1683 to 1686, and again from 1689 to 1691.
He came to office at a time a large part of the province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México was independent of Spanish rule due to the Pueblo Revolt.
With limited resources, he was unable to reconquer the province.
Early career.
Domingo Jironza Pétriz de Cruzate was born around 1640 in the province of Huesca in Aragon, Spain.
Possibly he was the Domingo Xironza who married Sebastiana de Oquendo in Mexico City on 30 April 1663. 
If so, he was the son of Antonio Xironza and Ana Mangues Pérez.
He joined the Spanish armed forces and served in the wars between Spain and Portugal.
On 10 April 1680 Jironza sailed from Cadiz as Captain in command of fifty soldiers, bound for New Spain.
On his arrival the viceroy, Payo Enríquez de Rivera, made him mayor of Metztitlán, an office that he held until 1682.
New Mexico governor.
The Spanish were driven out of New Mexico in 1680 after the Pueblo Revolt. In 1683 Jironza was appointed Captain General and Governor of the New Mexico frontier, with the mandate of fighting the Apaches and attempting to re-conquer the territory. His headquarters were at El Paso del Norte, and he founded the Presidio of San Elizario near to that town.
On 15 October 1683 a party of seven Jumano Indians from La Junta de los Ríos, at the junction of the Rio Conchos and Rio Grande near modern-day Presidio, Texas, came to El Paso, asking for the Spanish to send missionaries to their country and beyond. Their spokesman, Juan Sabeata, talked of the great wealth of these lands, and those of the great kingdom of Texas that lay beyond. Jironza sent Juan Domínguez de Mendoza, an experienced militia leader, and Fray Nicolás López to explore the Jumano country and establish missions. The expedition left El Paso on 15 December 1683, going down the Rio Grande to La Junta, then on to the Edwards Plateau. They spent six weeks there, building a fort as defense against Apaches near the location of modern San Angelo, Texas, and hunting buffalo for hides and food. They fed and baptized many of the friendly local people who visited their camp. On their return, Domínguez and López made a strong case for sending soldiers and missionaries to the Jumano country. However, Governor Jironza was unable to help since his forces were tied up fighting the Pueblos.
On March 14, 1684, friendly Tiwas and Piros told Jironza of a Manso plot to kill all the Spaniards in El Paso. The Mansos were "tired of everything having to do with God and with the church, which is why they wanted to do what the Indians of New Mexico had done." The Spanish imprisoned the ringleaders of the plot, who included an Apache and a Quivira Indian (probably a Wichita). Ten of them were executed. Later, in November, the Spanish garrison of 60 men plus friendly Indians attacked a gathering of hostile Indians who apparently intended to carry out the plot.
Jironza led an expedition against the Apaches in 1684. He was not given sufficient soldiers to effect the reconquest of New Mexico, because resources were held back due to rumours that the French were conducting an expedition in Texas, and preventing this would be the higher priority. This was the invasion of eastern Texas by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1685.
In 1685 Jironza made an effort to collect the refugees from New Mexico who had disobeyed royal orders and left the El Paso area.
Jironza was temporarily removed from office in 1686 since his activities in the Nueva Vizcaya region had caused conflict with both the church and the civil authorities.
Jironza's successor Pedro Reneros de Posada proved ineffective and Jironza was reinstated in 1688 or 1689. His first action was to march north, where he sacked and burned Zia Pueblo. This was the bloodiest engagement during the Pueblo Revolt, causing the Indians to abandon their settlements and retreat into the mountains. Six hundred Indians were killed, but the Spanish again did not have sufficient resources to follow through, and Jironza was forced to retire to El Paso. On this expedition he was accompanied by seventy Franciscan Friars.
He was planning to make another effort to reconquer New Mexico in 1691, but had to cancel the expedition while he dealt with uprisings by the Suma Indians to the south of El Paso.
He was succeeded as governor that year by Diego de Vargas.
Documents apparently signed by Jironza in 1689 granted land to eleven Pueblos. However, two centuries later these were found to be forgeries.
His successor, Captain General Diego de Vargas Zapata Lujan Ponce de León y Contreras, set out from El Paso around the end of August 1692, and took possession of Santa Fe on 14 September 1692 without having to fight.
Later career.
Jironza was made captain of the mobile "Presidio de las Fronteras de Sonora" force in 1691, operating from various temporary bases on the northern frontier, the last being the mining camp of San Juan Bautista de Sonora. He fought against the Apaches, Janos, Jocomes, Upper Pimas, and Sumas. His nephew Juan Mateo Mange left Spain to join his uncle in 1692. He was appointed lieutenant, alcade mayor and "capitan á guerra", and was given the duty of accompanying the missionaries in Sonora and recording their discoveries. These reports provide an excellent source of information on the exploration of northern Sonora.
In 1701 Domingo Jironza Pétriz de Cruzate was replaced as captain by General Jacinto de Fuensaldaña. He remained in San Juan Bautista after his retirement. The last record that mentions him is dated September 1708, when he was mayordomo of the community church.

More (bus company)

More is a bus company operating bus services in the Poole and Bournemouth areas formerly operated under the Wilts & Dorset name. It forms part of the larger Go South Coast division of the Go-Ahead Group. 
History.
More was originally launched in December 2004 as a premium service replacing routes 101 to 105 between Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch and routes 155, 156 and 157 between Poole and Canford Heath. The 'more' specification buses represented a £4 million investment and was originally due to launch in October 2004 but due to a driver shortage was postponed until December 2004. The service launched with 30 Wright Eclipse bodied Volvo B7RLE single-deck buses. 'More' buses carry a livery of mostly dark blue with red at the back; the original 30 also carry slogans such as "looks like a bus, works like a dream".
Such was the success of the 'more' services it was decided that the frequency on the m1 and m2 routes was to be increased and the m1 extended to the Castlepoint shopping centre on the outskirts of Bournemouth from Bournemouth railway station. With only 30 'more' branded buses in the fleet at the time, the 'more' branded routes to Canford Heath were discontinued, with the 'm' dropped from the route number and standard liveried vehicles used. For these routes to become 'more' route again a batch of Mercedes-Benz Citaros were ordered. The original 'more' buses were going to be Citaros, but it was thought that Volvo would offer a quicker delivery time. Further changes to the routes occurred on 25 May 2008, with the m2 being withdrawn from Burton (transferred to Route X12 which was later withdrawn also) and Somerford to terminate at Boscombe.
During 2010 the "More" brand was refreshed with every bus being repainted in a slightly brighter, simpler version of the previous livery, each highlighting a good reason for using the "More" Buses for Example "morefrequent" is applied to W&D 119 HF54 HGM.
In May 2011 routes m5 and m6 were once again dropped from the 'more' brand and renumbered as routes 5 and 6.
In June 2012 Wilts & Dorset announced a £5.5 million investment in 36 Wright Eclipse bodied Volvo buses to be used on m1/m2 routes whilst the previous 38 Wright Eclipse Urban Volvos and Mercedes-Benz Citaros would be cascaded onto other services replacing older buses (including Bluestar). Also at this time, Routes 8 and 9 became part of the 'More' brand.
Phase out of "Wilts & Dorset".
In July 2012 it was announced that all Wilts & Dorset bus services in and around Poole and Bournemouth would all be rebranded as 'More', whilst those in and around Salisbury and Amesbury would be branded as Salisbury Reds.
The More Nightbus.
On 30 May 2008 the More 'Nightbus' sub-brand launched with the m1's operating every half hour between Poole Bus Station and Charminster (Five Ways) and the m2's operating every half hour between Bournemouth Square and Iford Roundabout on Friday and Saturday nights.
During June 2010, the m1 nightbus was extended beyond the Five Ways to the Broadway Tavern another few minutes up Charminster Road. May 2011 saw the m2 nightbus route changed beyond Pokesdown to serve Southbourne (Fisherman's Walk).
In June 2012, a new nightbus route, the N3, was launched connecting Bournemouth to Bournemouth University. Also, all three services started operating on Thursday nights, in addition to Friday and Saturday nights.
On 21 February 2013 saw the withdrawal of the Thursday Night services, along with the N3 route.
The bus for Bournemouth University.
More Bus operates four routes on behalf of Bournemouth University, having secured a second five-year contract to do so during summer 2009. Since 11 January 2010, these routes have been branded as 'The Bus for Bournemouth University' or 'The Bus for BU' with buses appearing in the institution's primary corporate colours of white and pink.
From 2004, when the university contract originally transferred to Wilts & Dorset from Yellow Buses, until the end of 2009 services were branded as Unilinx and operated by a mixed fleet of double-deck buses (Optare Spectras and brand-new Volvo B7TL ELC Myllennium Vyking convertibles) painted in a modified version of the 'more' livery. Unilinx-branded buses were also a common sight on non-Unilinx services, especially on service 152 (laterly the 52) where ELC Myllennium Vyking buses ran open top throughout the summer.
In 2009, when the university contract was renewed, eight buses of which six are Scania Enviro 400 double decker buses are used on the U1, U2 and U4 routes and a Scania Solar single deck bus for the U3 route were purchased new along with an ex-London articulated Mercedes-Benz Citaro bus was introduced to route U1 on 10 January 2010, primarily running a shuttle service to boost capacity between Talbot Campus and the student residences at Lansdowne. It is believed to be the first such bus in service on the South Coast, and initially had its route number and destination 'blinds' as part of its livery, including a misspelling of 'Cranbourne' as this bus was used exclusively between Talbot Campus and Cranborne House. For the 2012-2013 academic year, a second articulated bus has been acquired, and the U1, U2 and U4 bus routes can see the articulated buses, the shuttle between Talbot and Lansdowne being re-routed to serve the new Dorchester House halls of residence as well as the other Lansdowne halls. All of the buses apart from the ex-London articulated bus were purchased new and arrived in January 2010 pushing out the Volvo B7TL's, which were then cascaded back into the Wilts & Dorset fleet after being re-painted into the latest livery. Outside of term times, BU-branded buses can often be seen running other More bus routes across the Poole and Bournemouth areas.
The New Forest Tour.
Originally started by Solent Blue Line (now Bluestar) in 2004, The New Forest Tour became jointly operated by Bluestar and Wilts & Dorset in the summer of 2011 (?) when the addition of a second route (Red Route) was operated by the Ringwood Depot (which is now in the 'More' area). A 3rd route, the Blue Route, will be added when the tour restarted for the summer of 2013.
The original tour, the Green Route, started with an open-top Bristol VR and ran on both the 2004 and 2005 season. 2006 saw 2 Convertible Volvo B7TL East Lancs Myllennium Vyking's, 408 and 409 drafted from Wilts & Dorset, for the tour, but remained in the W&D livery with New Forest Tour vinyls. For the 2007 season, they became part of the Bluestar Fleet and where put into the New Forest Tour livery. The Red Route is operated by another Volvo B7TL East Lancs Myllennium Vyking from the Wilts & Dorset Fleet with New Forest Tour vinyls and it is expected that the Blue Route will also be operated by the same type of bus in 2013.
Former 'More' & non-'More' routes.
From 4 June 2006, m5 was rerouted along Wimborne Road instead of via Park Gates
The m7 was dropped as part of the Poole route restructuring from 4 June 2006. Service on m5 and m6 increased as a result and a while later, lost their more branding and became standard routes during the changes of May 1, 2011.
Wimborne Flyer.
The Wimborne Flyer, also known as service 3, replaced the Poole to Wimborne section of service 132 after the major restructuring of Poole services in June 2006. It runs four times an hour Monday to Saturday. The service differs from the old service 132 by taking a direct route between Poole and Broadstone, using a faster route through Merley and extending the service from Wimborne Square to the Leigh Park estate. The service when launched was almost exclusively operated by Mercedes-Benz Citaros in the new standard Wilts & Dorset livery, though 'more' Citaros and Wright Eclipse Urbans were also seen.
Local residents criticised the change of route, specifically through Merley where the buses took a narrower but more direct road through the estate. Some criticism has also been aimed at the Citaro buses after a number of accidents, including buses demolishing walls while trying to pass each other on a narrow road and tearing hanging baskets from walls in Wimborne Square while turning. Following numerous complaints, Wilts & Dorset rerouted the service through Merley from 29 October 2006, reverting back to part of the old 132 route through Merley Gardens.
From 6 April 2008 two out of the four buses per hour started to run via Corfe Mullen rather than Merley with all services also stopping at Broadstone Broadway. Services to and from Leigh Park only run during the morning and evening peak. With the Wimborne Flyer now covering the section of route between Broadstone and Corfe Mullen, most service 4 journeys started to terminate at Broadstone.
As part of the 2012 June 3 network changes, the 3 was withdrawn and was merged with Route 4 extended beyond Broadstone to Wimborne either via Merley or Corfe Mullen. After many complaints, Route 4X was introduced between Poole & Broadstone/Merley via the old Route 3 during the morning and evening rush-hour towards the end of June 2012. Towards the end of July 2012 however, it was announced that Route 3 would be re-instated from September 17, 2012 and that both routes 3 & 4 would join the more brand.

The Xfm Top 1000 Songs of All Time

The Xfm Top 1000 Songs of All Time is a musical reference book edited by various DJ's from radio station "Xfm", first published in 2010. The most recent edition consists of a list of singles and popular album tracks released between 1965 and 2009, published by Elliott & Thompson Limited. The book is arranged alphabetically rather than in the form of a chart, while Brandon Flowers of The Killers provides a foreword.
The list was determined by listener votes of the radio station voting on their website, opinions from DJ's and radio play requests on the stations flagship show "The X-List". The station broadcasts to London and Manchester on digital DAB radio, and online to the rest of the world, with nearly 1 million listeners. The station also has a close relationship with Australian station "Triple J". Each entry in the list is accompanied by a short essay written by a DJ. The entries are accompanied by pictures, quotes, and additional information. As mentioned before, the list not only included singles, but also album-only tracks that entered public knowledge, with Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" and Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" being examples.
Although the book mostly keeps to alternative rock acts of the present day, as well as classic bands such as The Beatles while the most recent singles in the book take up most of the list, many artists who appeared expressed their achievement as a highlight of their career, with a small number writing on the "Xfm" official site and also in the book itself.

Sparrow Clubs USA

Sparrow Clubs USA is a non-profit organization based in the Pacific Northwest. The premise for the club is for high schools to adopt children with various diseases such as cancer and help rise for the families of the children to help cover medical expenses. It received national attention in an edition of ABC's popular series "" when they profiled The McPhail Family.
History.
In 1992, teacher Jeff Leeland and his wife Kristi found themselves in a desperate situation. Insurance at his new job did not cover the $200,000 needed for a lifesaving bone marrow transplant for his nine-month-old son, Michael. Jeff taught an Adaptive PE class where Dameon, a 325 pound seventh grader, helped out daily. After hearing about his teacher’s dilemma, Dameon emptied his bank account and made an offering of twelve five dollar bills to help save Michael's life. Dameon's $60 donation of hope started a chain reaction of compassion by the kids and staff at Kamiakin Junior High. The community rallied behind these students and in just four weeks an amazing $227,000 was raised, Michael received his lifesaving transplant, and kids at Kamiakin were the heroes! These students created a future model for students to become catalysts of the same spirit of compassion and contribution in their own communities by helping children in medical need... and in 1995, Sparrow Clubs was born.
National Attention.
C.J. McPhail, along with his wife Lindsay, started a chapter of the Sparrow Clubs in Southern Oregon seven years after the original Club started. Their generousity and ongoing work earned them national attention in 2011 when they were selected to have their home rebuilt on the ABC television reality series "". Their rundown home was torn down and a new home was built for the family. The entire construction process was chronicled on local ABC affiliate KDRV NewsWatch 12 and all other television outlets.

Akaflieg Braunschweig SB-13 Arcus

The Akaflieg Braunschweig SB-13 Arcus was an experimental tailless, single seat, Standard Class glider designed and built in Germany in the early 1990s. Though it performed as well as its conventional contemporaries, it did not offer sufficiently improved performance to compenstate for its difficult handling characteristics.
Design and development.
The Akaflieg Braunschweig or Akademische Fliegergruppe Braunschweig () is one of some fourteen German undergraduate student flying groups attached to and supported by their home Technical University. Several have designed and built aircraft, often technically advanced and leading the development of gliders in particular. In 1982 when the SB-13 design was first discussed no new tailless glider had been built for thirty years, during which time glass reinforced plastic materials had replaced wood in glider construction and much learned about laminar flow wings; it was hoped that tailless designs would be lighter, simpler and cheaper.
Work on the SB-13 Arcus, named after the cloud formation, began in 1982. Because of the novelty of the layout, a one-third scale model of the early design was built and flown, revealing several serious problems. Strong flutter was experienced even at modest speed and the aircraft was very sensitive to the centre of gravity (c.g.) position. It stalled readily when this was too far aft. Recovery from the spin that followed was difficult. With the c.g. too far forward, a rapid longitudinal "pecking" oscillation set in which, because of its short period, was hard to control. Major redesign, involving long and difficult computer analysis led to a new wing with carbon fibre stiffening on the main spar; in addition, both it and the wing plan were made curved. The new structure resisted flutter until 270 km/h (168 mph) was reached.
The full scale SB-13 finally flew in 1988. Its 15 m (49 ft 2.5 in) wing was straight edged, with three slightly tapered sections of increasing sweep. The two inner panels occupied less than 1.9 m (6 ft 3 in) of the span and the outer section leading edge was swept at about 17°. All had a dihedral of 4°. At its tips, where the chord was 600 mm (24.6 in), the wing turned upwards into 1250 mm (49.2 in) tall, slightly swept winglets, which carried rudders. Elevons occupied much of the outer panel trailing edge and, further inboard, mid-chord mounted airbrakes were fitted. The fuselage, onto which the wings were mounted between low and mid position was a short pod with its nose a little ahead of the centre section leading edge, extending aft about as far as the trailing horizontal edge of the wing at its tip. The pilot reclined under a long, bulged, single piece canopy, which was side hinged to starboard. The cockpit reached beyond the wing both forward and aft, with the main spar passing through it under the pilot's knees.
Despite the modifications made to remove the handling problems predicted by the model, the full scale SB-13 still "pecked" and spun readily; when the standard spin correction procedure was applied, an new spin started in the opposite direction. Over the next few years several aerodynamic devices were tried, some of which at least improved the behaviour of the Arcus; one longer-lasting outcome from the project was the start of an investigation into whole aircraft rescue parachutes. The competition performance of the Arcus was on a par with that of other 15 m gliders of the time but it did not offer the great improvement over them which might have justified even more effort to improve the handling.
Operational history.
The sole SB-13 was flown, modified and studied from 1988 to 2000, when it was damaged and set aside in favour of newer aircraft. In 2007 it went to the Deutsches Museum, Munich for exhibition.

Scleral tattooing

Scleral tattooing is the practice of tattooing the sclera, or white part of the human eye. This process is relatively new and is viewed as an extreme practice.
History.
In late 2007, Body Modification Ezine wrote an article describing the first three scleral tattoo procedures performed on sighted eyes. The tattoo artist tried two different procedures, the first covering the needle with ink and puncturing the eye. This method was deemed unsuccessful, and the second method was attempted. This procedure, in which the sclera was injected with blue dye, was successful. The procedures were “effectively painless because there aren’t nerve endings in the surface of the eye,” says the article's author Shannon Larratt. The aftereffects include “fairly minor” pain, bruising, and some discomfort. Also, the author, who had the procedure performed on himself, seems to have some blisters between the sclera and conjunctiva. The author twice indicates the risks and possible complications, the most important including blindness, of the procedure and warns that it should not be performed without a professional. Scleral tattooing is extremely new and still experimental.
Oklahoma legislation.
A local Oklahoma newspaper wrote about the Oklahoma Senate panel trying to make eye tattooing illegal. Senate Bill 844 was filed by Oklahoma Senator Cliff Branan and would make it illegal to tattoo the sclera of the eye. The Oklahoma Academy of Ophthalmology requested for this bill to pass because of the dangers of the procedure. It was eventually passed April 21, 2009.

Gideonmantellia

Gideonmantellia is an extinct genus of basal ornithopod dinosaur known from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian stage) of Galve, Province of Teruel, Spain. It contains a single species, Gideonmantellia amosanjuanae.
Discovery and naming.
In 1982, amateur palaeontologist José María Herrero Marzo together with his son Jesús uncovered in a loam pit near Galve, the "Poyales Barranco Canales" site, the remains of a small euornithopod. In 1987 from this material by José Luis Sanz a left femur and ilium were described, which he referred to "Hypsilophodon foxii". In 1995 José Ignacio Ruiz-Omeñaca realised the find represented a separate taxon, after he had further prepared the bones in 1994 and 1995. Ruiz-Omeñaca continued his studies from 1996, as part of his thesis. In 2001 he published a more detailed and complete description, in 2004 reaffirming that a new species had been discovered. In 2006, in his doctoral thesis he named this "Gideonmantellia amosanjuanae"; as a "nomen ex dissertatione" this name was as yet invalid though.
In 2012, the type species "Gideonmantellia amosanjuanae" was validly named and redescribed by Ruiz-Omeñaca, José Ignacio Canudo, Gloria Cuenca-Bescós, Penélope Cruzado-Caballero, José Manuel Gasca and Miguel Moreno-Azanza. The generic name honours the first describer of "Hypsilophodon", Gideon Mantell. The specific name honours the late palaeontologist María Olga Amo Sanjuán, who studied the Cretaceous Galve fauna.
The holotype, MPG-PBCH, was found in a fluvial deposit of the Camarillas Formation, dating from the early Barremian. It consists of a partial articulated skeleton, lacking the skull, of a juvenile individual, including thirty-three vertebrae of the back, hip and tail, twenty-one fragments of the neural arches, six chevrons, rib fragments, ossified tendons, the left pelvis and both hindlimbs. The specimen is part of the collection of the Museo Paleontológico de Galve and displayed in the palaeontological hall of the townhall of Galve.
Phylogeny.
The taxon was in 1995 and 2001 assigned to the Hypsilophodontidae. Today this is considered an unnatural paraphyletic group and "Gideonmantellia" was in 2012 placed in a basal position in the Ornithopoda. The cladogram below follows Ruiz-Omeñaca "et al.", 2012.

Taghadoe

Taghadoe in county Kildare is the site of an ancient monastic settlement and Round Tower, there is a graveyard and the ruins of a 19th-century church. It is situated 5 km from Maynooth, off the Straffan Road. The name is probably derived from "Teach Tua" or "House of Tua" in Irish, Saint Tua (Ultan the Silent) the abbot of Clonmacnoise, was responsible for founding the monastic settlement here. The site dates back to the 6th Century. The Round Tower used for about 1000 years but was left in ruins by the 17th Century.
Most of the burials were in the 17th and 18th century and it was used by Roman Catholics.
A John Dillon of Carton had bequeathed £1000 for the building of a church on the site, the Duke of Leinster was the executor of his will.
The Church which was constructed on the site in 1831 for the Church of Ireland by a donation from the Board of First Fruits of €830, this church was only active for 40 years and while derelict its walls are quite intact.
The Tower was declared a National Monument in 1886, and the site is in the care of the Office of Public Works(OPW).

Anglo-Franco-Scottish Friendship Cup

The Anglo-Franco-Scottish Friendship Cup was a short-lived Inter-League football competition organised by the French Football Federation that would see teams from the Scottish League compete against teams from their own league, the French League. 
Format.
The original idea was to have four teams from Scotland and four teams from England competing together as one nation competing against eight teams from France. Due to the objection by the Scottish League this ruling was cancelled. 
Two separate trophies were cast - one for Scottish clubs competing against French clubs and one for English clubs competing against French clubs. Individual clubs couldn't win the competition, so each country was awarded 2 points for a win and 1 point for a draw.
Entry to the competition was based on a club's final league position at the end of the season. However, with some club's guaranteed entry to European football competitions such the European Cup and Inter Cities Fairs Cup it would open up the chance for other club's to participate who finished lower down their domestic league.
History.
In the inaugural competition, Sedan, Toulouse, Lens and Valenciennes were all given entry from the French League to participate. Clyde, Motherwell, Celtic and Dundee were all given entry from the Scottish League.
The second season of the competition saw a completely different line up from the French League as Le Havre, Rouen, Nimes and Reims came in for Sedan, Toulouse, Lens and Valenciennes to compete on the behalf of France. With Celtic and Motherwell set to compete again, Aberdeen and Third Lanark replaced Clyde and Dundee. 
Due to disagreements of when matches should be played, neither of the matches between Celtic and Reims took place.
1960-61.
Scotland won the inaugural edition of the trophy by winning the series, 3 aggregate victories to 1.
1961-62.
France won the last edition of the trophy by winning the series, 2 aggregate victories to 1.

Dirnitz

A dirnitz ( or "Türnitz", from the Slavic "dorniza" = "heated parlour") or Knights' Hall was the heatable area of a medieval castle. It was usually a single large room on the ground floor of the "palas" below the Great Hall. It was often expensively furnished and had a decorative vault. Occasionally it also described the cabinet ("Kemenate") or an entire hall building. The term is German.
From the mid-15th century, the "dirnitz", if used as a reception or gathering room or as a courtroom, was sometimes also called a courtroom ("Hofstube").
Typical examples of a "dirnitz" may be seen at the Wartburg and Heinfels Castle. The "dirnitz" at Burghausen Castle is one of the rare examples where the heatable hall is on an upper storey.

The High Commissioner from the United Kingdom to Uganda is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in the Republic of Uganda, and in charge of the UK's diplomatic mission in Uganda.
As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Kingdom and Uganda conduct their diplomatic relations at governmental level, rather than between Heads of State. Therefore the countries exchange High Commissioners, rather than ambassadors.

Hillsborough Primary School

Hillsborough Primary School is situated on Parkside Road in the suburb of Hillsborough in the City of Sheffield, England. The school caters for children between the ages of four and eleven. The building itself dates from 1884 and is a Grade II listed building.
History.
Hillsborough School was constructed by the architects Wilson & Masters. At the time of construction, the Hillsborough area was a rural location outside the City of Sheffield and within the parish of Ecclesfield so it fell to the Ecclesfield School Board to instigate the building of a school for the area. The Board borrowed £5,745 from the Public Works Loan Commissioners to build the school. Hillsborough Board School, as it was then known, was opened on 7 July 1884 by George Dawson, Chairman of the School Board, it had a department for older children as well as an infants section. By October 1886 there were 431 pupils in the school and in March 1892, a separate department for the older girls was created. The school became within the jurisdiction of Sheffield Council on 1 November 1901 when the boundaries of the city were extended, encompassing the Hillsborough area, at this time the school name was changed to Hillsborough Council School and there were over 600 pupils. In 1958 the school lost its senior section when the older pupils were transferred to the newly built Chaucer School and Hillsborough became solely a junior school. In October 1982 a nursery was opened on the site..
Architecture.
The school consists of one storey and is constructed in the Gothic Revival style from coursed squared stone with ashlars dressings and a slate roof, with diagonal nogging over the windows. The three symmetrical blocks which front onto Parkside Road are linked by corridors constructed in the mid 1900s. The closest of these blocks to the junction with Middlewood Road has on its roof a square wooden bell turret with swept pyramidal spire and finial. The stone boundary wall which runs round the perimeter of the school is also a listed structure.

You're Gone (Marillion song)

You're Gone is the lead single from Marillion's 13th studio album "Marbles", released in 2004. The song marked a comeback for the band, reaching number 7 on the UK Singles Chart and becoming their first top ten hit since 1987's "Incommunicado". It also made number 8 on the Dutch Top 40.
Background and release.
In the studio, singer Steve Hogarth was inspired by a chord sequence generated on a computer by guitarist Steve Rothery, and was able to fit a pre-written lyric around it. Hogarth has said, "It's a simple song. It's about losing a great light in your life and living in the shadow of it, and yet rejoicing in the fact that it was ever there – and it still is there, somewhere." "You're Gone" has been characterised as an address of "romantic disappointment".
Although the band's mainstream popularity had dissipated in the late 1990s, they retained a strong cult following. Three separate versions of the single (two CD versions and a DVD version) were promoted to mailing list subscribers, and the song's commercially-friendly sound – notably its current, U2-like feel – made it more accessible to mainstream audiences than previous Marillion singles. Despite "You're Gone" becoming the second-highest new entry of the week and generating renewed media interest in the band, they were denied an appearance on the BBC's flagship chart television show "Top of the Pops", and were dismissed by then-BBC presenter Jonathan Ross as "a prog rock band that sing about goblins." Guitarist Steve Rothery criticised Ross' archaic perception of the band, saying, "We recorded "Script for a Jester's Tear" 22 years ago. I think that was when Ross had his own hair."
Music video.
A basic music video was created for the single, directed by The Boom Boom Boys. It largely features Hogarth delivering the song, with occasional shots of the band and minimal effect overlay.

The 1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident was an aerial tramway accident in Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet Georgia on June 1 1990, which resulted in at least 20 deaths and 15 injuries. 
The accident involved 2 gondolas on a ropeway route between Rustaveli Avenue and Mount Mtatsminda. The cable car was on its way down from the slope of the mount near the Mtatsminda Pantheon. When the hauling rope broke the lower gondola rolled back and slammed on the wall of the lower station injuring people, the upper gondola rolled down generating higher speed (brakes didn't work), on reaching the lower cable car support mast it struck and broke the hauling rope which tore a gondola apart and caused people to fall from 20 metres of height onto rooftops and ground, at least 20 were killed and 15 injured after jumping from the accelerating gondola. Most of them were children celebrating Children's Day. Days before, the standard Soviet gondolas were changed to bigger ones brought from Finland without any precautions.

<doc id="36535397" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36535397" title="United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp.">
United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp.

United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court interpreted the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) as not allowing a gas supply company to unilaterally modify rates in a natural gas supply contract by filing a new rate schedule with the Federal Power Commission (FPC). "Mobile Gas" and its companion case "Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co." established the "Mobile-Sierra" presumption which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be "just and reasonable" and thus acceptable under the NGA or Federal Power Act (FPA).
Background.
The NGA was enacted in 1938 to regulate the interstate natural gas industry, including gas pipeline companies. The NGA regulated the rates charged by gas companies to their customers, which included local gas distribution companies and industrial users, through the filing by gas companies of rate schedules and contracts with customers. The NGA required gas companies to file tariffs of their new rates with the FPC, a federal administrative agency, at least thirty days prior to their becoming effective, and authorized the FPC to investigate rates to determine if they were in the public interest. The FPC could also suspend rates except for those involving gas supplied to industrial users while the investigating the rates.
In 1946 the Ideal Cement Company wanted to construct a cement plant in Mobile, Alabama. The local natural gas distribution company, Mobile Gas Service Company, entered into a ten year contract with the United Gas Pipe Line Company to obtain gas at 10.7 cents per thousand cubic feet (MCF), which was at a substantially lower price than that charged for other gas customers, so that it could then provide the gas to the cement plant at 12 cents per MCF. The contract between Mobile Gas and United Gas was filed with and approved by the FPC, and became part of the tariff and contracts on file for United Gas.
In June 1953 United Gas filed a new rate schedule with the FPC which purported to increase the rate for the natural gas for resale to the Ideal Cement plant to 14.5 cents per MCF, which was a rate closer to that paid by other gas customers. Mobile Gas objected, stating that under the NGA United Gas could not unilaterally change the contract rate. The FPC ruled that the new rate, being a non-suspendable industrial rate under the NGA, would automatically become effective thirty days after it was filed unless it found the rate to be unlawful. Mobile Gas paid the new rate until April 15, 1955, when it assigned its contract with Ideal Cement to United Gas with the approval of the FPC. Since the only remaining issue was the alleged excess payment resulting from the difference between 10.7 and 14.5 cents per MCF that Mobil Gas had paid to United Gas while responsible for the contract, the FPC ended its investigation regarding the validity of the new rate as it believed that its ruling would not have a retroactive effect.
Mobile Gas appealed the administrative decision of the FPC to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which reversed the decision and directed the FPC to reject the new tariffed rate in question and to order United Gas to refund the excess payments received under the new rate. The FPC and United Gas appealed the circuit court order to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.
Opinion.
The unanimous opinion by Justice Harlan noted that there was no allegation that the NGA was unconstitutional, so the only issue in the case involved the statutory interpretation of the NGA. The opinion stated that the provision in the NGA requiring the filing of rate schedules was not a rate setting procedure, but a prerequisite to the establishment of new rates. While the NGA
required a gas company to file new rates and contracts with the FPC, it did not authorize the abrogation of any contract in effect. The FPC could investigate rates in contracts, but contracts could be modified or rejected by the FPC only if the rate in the contract was found to be so low as to be harmful to third parties and not in the public interest. Thus, a gas company had no authority to unilaterally change a rate in a contract by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC.
The opinion also explained that the NGA was different from the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) then in effect, which required transportation companies to use the same rate schedule for all customers and did not authorize special rates to be set by contract with individual customers as the large number of customers engaged in interstate commerce did not permit an administrative agency to review contracts with special rates. In comparison, there were relatively few gas companies and customers, and the NGA’s authorization to set rates using contracts recognized that dedicated infrastructure and capacity with individualized costs might be required for a gas company to serve a customer. Based on this difference, the Court then distinguished the prior case of "Armour Packing Co. v. United States "(1908), where a contract between a shipper and a railroad used the same rate as in a rate schedule filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The railroad later filed a new rate schedule with the ICC. The Supreme Court held in that case that the new rate applied as the ICA, unlike the NGA, required the same rate schedule for all customers.
As the NGA did not authorize a gas company to change rates specified in its contracts unilaterally, the new rate schedule filed by United Gas was a nullity with respect to the gas provided for the Ideal Cement plant. As such, United Gas was required to refund the excess payments made under the new rate schedule to Mobile Gas.
Subsequent events.
The Supreme Court in the companion case "FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co." found a similar result regarding contracts filed with the FPC involving electricity sales under the FPA. In later cases, the validity of rates set by contracts between gas and electric transmission companies became known as the "Mobile"-"Sierra" presumption. Under this presumption, an electricity or gas rate specified in a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be “just and reasonable” and thus acceptable under the FPA or NGA.
A later case which had facts similar to Mobile Gas, except that the contract between the gas pipeline company and customer stated that the applicable rate was the rate in the schedule filed with the FPC. In "United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division" (1958), the Supreme Court held that the gas company could revise the referenced gas rate in the contract by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC.
The cost of natural gas supplied by United Gas to the cement plant in Mobile, Alabama was the subject of a later Supreme Court decision, "United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Ideal Cement Co." (1962). The issue in that case was whether United Gas could recoup the cost of a tax levied by the City of Mobile on natural gas sales. The Supreme Court vacated a lower court ruling that the tax was actually a means of licensing a pipeline company’s right to enter the state, and stated that federal courts should abstain from ruling on complex state law issues which have not yet been resolved. This form of federal court abstention is based on the case of "Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co." (1941) and is known as the "Pullman" abstention doctrine.
On October 1, 1977, the FPC was replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Railroad Revival Tour

The Railroad Revival Tour is an annual music tour created by David Conway that features popular roots, folk, country, rock, bluegrass and Americana acts that began in 2011.
The musicians travel between shows across the American Southwest in a dozen or so vintage train cars from the 1950s and 1960s. The outdoor concert locations, sometimes attracting over 10,000 fans, are often a stone's throw from the train. The bands eat, sleep and engage in impromptu jam sessions on the train between stops, giving them a chance to collaborate. On stage at night, they often join in on each other's sets, sometimes bringing around 30 musicians up to create a rare and rowdy performance. The organic American roots feeling of the tour also prompts participating musicians to honor U.S. railway history, like Mumford & Sons' tribute to Woody Guthrie in 2011.
The inaugural tour in 2011 included performances by Mumford & Sons, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and Old Crow Medicine Show. A documentary of this first year, called "Big Easy Express", directed by Emmett Malloy premiered at SXSW 2012 and won a Grammy Award in 2013. The film is currently available on iTunes and DVD/Blu-ray Disc.
The 2012 tour was slated to include performances by Willie Nelson, Band of Horses, Jamey Johnson, and John Reilly and Friends. However, the tour was cancelled for 2012.

Oignies Abbey

Oignies Abbey (; originally Priory of St Nicolas d'Oignies) is a former Augustinian monastery in Belgium. Established in 1187, it is situated on the banks of the Sambre River. 
Origin.
In 1187, four brothers from Walcourt settled at Oignies, Three of the brothers, Gilles, Robert and John, were priests, while the fourth, Hugo, was a jeweller and metalworker. Several other men settled with them and they formed the community of St. Nicolas of Oignies, adopting the rule of St. Augustine. In 1192, St Nicolas of Oignies was officially recognized as a priory by the order of the Canons of St. Augustine. Gilles becomes the first prior, a position that he held for 4l years. The community built a church dedicated to St. Nicolas, which was consecrated in 1204. Following major alterations it was reconsecrated in 1226. In circa 1230, Hugo presented to the monastery a manuscript and silver book covers, the book cover depicting Hugo as a layman, and the monastery's patron saint St. Nicolas.
The women of this group settled in huts between the men's priory and the river. Marie of Oignies left her husband and arrived here in the first decade of the thirteenth century where she ran a community of beguines. Soon after, the cleric Jacques de Vitry arrived, and it was he who chronicled Marie's life after he became a priest. Hugo's medieval Gothic art pieces are recognized as "some of the most important examples of medieval Gothic metalwork".
History.
Though the priory remained a community of 12 to 20 men, it eventually became an Augustinian monastery. Between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries there were several fires. The wars in the southern Netherlands also caused destruction. In 1559, during the ecclesiastical reorganization of southern Netherlands, St Nicolas priory church became a part of the newly established Roman Catholic Diocese of Namur. It was suppressed in 1796. As with other monasteries, the priory's land parcels were sold and became public property. John Francis Pierlot, also known by his religious name Brother Gregory, was a native of Soignies and the 42nd and last prior of the abbey. In 1794, during the revolution, he left the Treasure of Hugo d'Oignies with a farmer and his wife in Falisolle, to prevent its confiscation by the state. In 1817, following the death of the farmer, it was retrieved from its hiding place, returning to the care of Father Pierlot. In 1818, he gave the Treasure to the Sisters of Notre Dame at Namur. After the revolution, however, some members of the religious community remained until 1808. In 1836, the new owner demolished the cloister. Some of the church furniture went to parish churches in the area, such as Saint Christopher (Charleroi) or St. Maarten (Ragnies). A statue of the Virgin from medieval times is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Situated on 3 hectares in a park-like setting, the building is now privately owned and can be rented for events such as seminars, conventions, and weddings.

Ndanda Abbey

The Abbey of Our Lady Help of Christians, Ndanda, Tanzania, is a Benedictine monastery of the Congregation of the Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien. Established in 1906 as a mission station in German East Africa, the monastery is currently home to 71 monks. Abbot Dionys Lindenmaier is the community's superior.
History.
Benedictines to Africa.
The first Missionary Benedictines arrived in German East Africa in 1887, following the creation of the Prefecture Apostolic of South Zanzibar. A first mission, established at Pugu near Dar-es-Salaam, ended in disaster, as three missionaries were killed and four kidnapped during the anti-colonial Bushiri uprising. Efforts at evangelization continued, with mission stations being opened throughout southeast German East Africa. 
With the expansion of the indigenous Christian population, the territory was raised to an apostolic vicariate in 1902. However, the 1905 Maji Maji uprising dealt the Missionary Benedictines a further blow: many missionaries, including the vicariate's bishop, Cassian Spiß, were killed.
From Mission Station to Abbatia Nullius.
In 1906, the Missionary Benedictines chose Ndanda as the site of a new mission. Located in southern Tanzania, 100 km from the Indian Ocean, the station would serve a population previously cared for by the missions of Nyangao and Lukuledi. 
In the early days of the mission, education was one of the main focuses of the Benedictines. Aided by indigenous catechists, missionaries successfully built a number of schools throughout the area, and proceeded to instruct young boarders. This service not only endeared the missionaries to the local community, but also contributed to the growth of the Christian population. 
Working in concert with the Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien, the Missionary Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing endeavored to make the mission station of Ndanda a source of health care, in spite of the fact that many of the missionaries themselves succumbed to tropical diseases like malaria and black water fever. The sisters managed a dispensary and a hospital to care for the local population, created a leprosarium, and eventually established an accredited nursing school. 
As the mission continued to expand, so did the Vicariate of Dar-es-Salaam. In 1913, the southern third of the area became the Prefecture Apostolic of Lindi. Following the German defeat in World War I, the British governor of Tanganyika expelled the Missionary Benedictines from the area. Into the breach stepped the British White Fathers, the Swiss Capuchins, and, eventually, Swiss members of the Congregation, whose training had begun in Uznach in 1919. By the mid-1920s, the colonial government allowed the Germans to return. 
In 1927, Lindi became an abbatia nullius, making the superior of the monastery also the ordinary of the territory. Thus, Fr Gallus Steiger, who had been part of the post-war Swiss relief, became the first Abbot of Lindi. Around this time, the personnel at Ndanda numbered 13 priests and ten brothers. 
Four years after Lindi's elevation to abbatia nullius, the territory was divided into two portions: in the west, the Abbatia Nullius of Peramiho, under Abbot Gallus; in the east, the Abbatia Nullius of Ndanda, under Abbot Joachim Ammann. At the time of his abbatial blessing, the community included nine priests, 18 brothers, and ten sisters.
Expansion as an Abbey.
World War II brought the internment of the German missionaries at Ndanda Abbey. Again, the Swiss Capuchins helped administer the territory in their absence. By 1946, the Germans were able to return and continue mission activity.
Cultivating indigenous vocations was a slow process. The Missionary Sisters of Tutzing began accepting local candidates for a community of African Benedictine sisters in 1939, but the war interrupted this endeavor. Likewise, Bro. Patiens Holenstein began training African brothers in 1947, but did not meet with success. However, vocations from American and British abbeys provided Ndanda with an influx of new personnel. 
In 1949, Fr. Viktor Hälg succeeded Abbot Joachim as superior of the community. Two years later, Abbot-Bishop Viktor ordained Faustin Bwenje, the first indigenous priest of the Abbatia Nullius of Ndanda.
As the monastic community expanded, their territory decreased. In 1963, Rome created the Diocese of Nachingwea in the western of the abbatia nullius. The remainder of the abbatia nullius became a diocese in 1972. The new bishop, a diocesan priest, took up residence in Mtwara. With this, Abbot-Bishop Viktor reverted to being the monastic community's religious superior. 
With the death of Abbot Viktor in 1975, Fr. Siegfried Hertlein became the third Abbot of Ndanda. After much discussion, the abbey finally opened a novitiate to train local monastic vocations. The first postulants were received in 1989. This development demonstrated the transition of Ndanda from being a mission station with a Benedictine orientation to being a monastery with a concern for cultivating a local Benedictine monasticism.
Personnel.
As of May 18, 2011, 51 solemnly professed monks (27 of them priests) resided at Ndanda. At this time, the community also included 13 temporally professed monks, seven novices, and six postulants. 
Abbot Father Dionys Lindenmaier is the current superior of the monastic community. Upon receiving the abbatial blessing on January 5, 2002, he became the third Abbot of Ndanda. Abbot Dionys is assisted in his duties by Fr. Silvanus Kessy (prior) and Bro. Yohanes Mango (subprior).

Taiwanese Braille is the braille script used on Taiwan for Taiwanese Mandarin ("Guoyu"). Although based marginally on international braille, the majority of consonants have been reassigned; also, like Mainland Chinese Braille, Taiwanese Braille is a semi-syllabary.

Initials.
The braille letters for zhuyin/pinyin ㄍ "g" (), ㄘ "c" (), and ㄙ "s" () double for the alveolo-palatal consonants ㄐ "j" (), ㄑ "q" (), and ㄒ "x" (). The latter are followed by close front vowels, namely ㄧ "i" () and ㄩ "ü" (), so the distinction between "z, c, s" (or "g, k, h") and "j, q, x" in zhuyin and pinyin is redundant.

Wyoming High School is a public high school located in Wyoming, Michigan and is part of the Wyoming Public Schools District in Kent County, Michigan. Wyoming High School was formed from the combination of Wyoming Park High School and Rogers High School
History.
Consolidation.
In early 2012, in order to meet the shortfall left by declining enrollment and the risk of reducing academic and elective offerings and laying off several staff members, Superintendent Dr. Thomas Reeder proposed to the Wyoming Public Schools Board of Education that they consolidate the district, saving not only more than $1 million, but also thereby keeping current offerings intact. Through a community survey and meetings with students and parents alike, board members gathered vital information from both sides. At the March 12th, 2012 board meeting, the board voted 4-3 in favor of combining the high schools and re-branding the district.
Beginning in the fall of 2012, 7th - 9th grade will be held at Wyoming Park High School, renamed Wyoming Junior High. 10th - 12th grade will be at Rogers High School, renamed Wyoming High School. The students were able to select and vote on a district-wide mascot (The Wolves) and colors (deep purple and black, with a silver accent), which were later narrowed down to their respective choices by a small committee of students, teachers, and parents, and were then presented to and adopted by the board. A fight song was also later determined by the students.

The Wyoming Theater Company produces the yearly musicals and plays which 9th through 12th grade students in Wyoming Public Schools have the opportunity to participate in. Involving over a hundred students each year, The Theater Company has been noted on local television and other media sources for its high quality and groundbreaking performances. Jeremy Schnotala directs the Wyoming Theater Company. Mr. Schnotala created The Wyoming Park Theater Company in 1994; when Wyoming Park and Rogers High Schools merged the Theater Company merged as well. Jeremy Schnotala continues to direct and lead the amazing theatrical productions. Information on past shows and current shows can be found at The Theater Company’s website: 
www.wyomingtheatercompany.com 
Some of the recent shows the Theater Company has produced are Spamalot, The Giver, Beauty and The Beast, The Crucible, Wind and the Willows, Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, and Willy Wonka to name just a few. 
The Wyoming High School Band is led by Brian Ambrose, who directed the Rogers High School band program for four years prior to the consolidation, and Eric Flack, who, after originally serving as part of the instructional staff for Wyoming Park High School's marching band in 2011, was later named assistant director of both programs after the departure of former assistant director Laura Hyler in late August of that year. The 2012 marching show is composed by Robert W. Smith. Drum Majors are Haley Altman, Adrian Labra, and Anna Petrenko.
The program held its first-ever band camp from July 30 to August 3 at Alma College in Alma, Michigan. 
On August 23, Wyoming Public Schools hosted a community event at the new high school preceding the evening's first home football game. At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, district administration requested a former student from Wyoming Park and a former student from Rogers, both from the band, to hold the ribbon. Those selected were drum majors Adrian Labra and Haley Altman. At 6PM, the band led a parade of community members into the stadium for the football game, followed by a performance of the national anthem and their 2012 show at halftime.
On August 25, the band performed at the opening ceremonies for the city of Wyoming's annual Metro Cruise. Almost a month later, the band performed at the third-annual Reason to Hope charity football game, with proceeds going towards research to find a cure for Alzheimer's. The following day, the band competed in its first competition of the season at the Rockford Invitational, walking away with 5th place and a score of 82.6.
On October 9, the band took part in the annual MSBOA District Marching Festival, this time held at East Kentwood High School. The band received straight 1's across the board, earning them their first Division 1 rating. A few days later on October 13, the band competed in its second competition at Grandville High School, earning 2nd place, a score of 86.0, the caption award for best marching, and awards of excellence in marching and percussion. The band then wrapped up its first season on October 20th (having recognized its senior members the night before at the high school's final home football game of the season), competing in the annual Jenison and East Kentwood marching invitationals and received a score of 84.6 and 2nd place, and 85.9 and 4th place respectively.
The 2013 season saw a few changes to the program. While band camp was again slated to be held at Alma College, around 140 new band members are expected to join the program. In addition, before the end of the 2012-13 school year, Eric Flack made the decision to no longer teach at Wyoming. His position as assistant director was then given to Shawn Gurk, who currently helms the junior high band program,

General Sir Lovell Benjamin Lovell, KH, KCB (1786 – 11 March 1861) was a lieutenant-general in the British Army. He was a descendant of Sir Salathiel Lovell, through the marriage of Lovell's daughter, Jane Lovell, to Richard Badcock, the eldest son of William Badcock, a London goldsmith.
Biography.
He was born Lovell Benjamin Badcock, the eldest son of Thomas Stanhope Badcock of Little Missenden Abbey, Buckinghamshire and Maplethorpe Hall, Lincolnshire.
Educated at Eton, Badcock commenced his distinguished military career in the Royal Bucks Militia. He fought under General Auchtermuty at Montevideo in 1807 and went through the Peninsula War with the 14th Light Dragoons until 1813, being awarded the Peninsula Medal with eleven clasps; a greater number than was given to any other officer of cavalry.
On retirement he became also Colonel of the 12th Lancers. He died at Brighton on 11 March 1861, having never married. He and his younger brother, Admiral William Stanhope Badcock, changed their name of Badcock to Lovell by sign-manual in 1840.
Interestingly, there is no known familial relationship between Lovell Benjamin Badcock and another prominent nineteenth century British Army general bearing the same surname - General Sir Alexander Robert Badcock.
A portrait of Badcock by T.W. MacKay, in hussar uniform, hangs in Calke Abbey, Derbyshire.

Gravity (Lecrae album)

Gravity is the sixth studio album by American Christian hip hop artist Lecrae, released on September 4, 2012. The album features appearances from Big K.R.I.T., Mathai, Ashthon Jones, and Mali Music, along with labelmates Trip Lee, Andy Mineo, Derek Minor, who was formerly known as PRo, and Tedashii. Producers on the album include DJ Khalil, Street Symphony's Heat Academy, and The Watchmen. The first single off the album, "I Know", was released on July 24, 2012, and was followed by "Tell the World" featuring Mali Music on August 15, 2012, and "Mayday" featuring Big K.R.I.T. and Ashthon Jones on August 30, 2012. Reach Records released five music videos for the album: "Lord Have Mercy", featuring Tedashii along with No Malice of Clipse, on August 1, 2012, "Tell the World", featuring Mali Music, on October 19, 2012, "Mayday", featuring Big K.R.I.T. and Ashthon Jones, on December 13, 2012, "Fakin'", featuring Thi'sl, on February 1, 2013, and "Confe$$ions", featuring David Banner, on April 30, 2013.
The first week of sales for the album set a new record for Lecrae, with "Gravity" debuting at No. 3 on the "Billboard" 200 with 72,000 units sold, and was the biggest sales week ever for a Christian hip hop album. The bonus track "Fuego" featuring KB and Suzy Rock from the iTunes deluxe edition of the album peaked at No. 20 on the "Billboard" Top Heatseekers Songs, No. 13 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Digital charts, and No. 64 on the Hot Digital Songs charts. Critically, "Gravity" was very well received, and is considered Lecrae's strongest, most mainstream work to date. It won Best Gospel Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards and Best Rap/Hip Hop Album at the 2013 Dove Awards. 
Background.
"Gravity" is a follow-up to the mixtape "Church Clothes", which was released earlier in 2012, and Lecrae's two previous studio albums, "Rehab", which was released in September 2010, and "", which followed five months later. The "Church Clothes" mixtape was released for free on May 10, 2012, and was hosted by DJ Don Cannon. It was considered Lecrae's step into the mainstream due to his collaboration with artists such as No Malice of Clipse and the producers 9th Wonder, Boi-1da, S1 and Street Symphony. The featuring of mainstream artists, particularly Don Cannon, was controversial within Christian circles. The mixtape was downloaded on DatPiff.com almost 100,000 times within 48 hours and in less than a month reached 250,000 downloads, a platinum rating on DatPiff.com.
Lecrae said in a statement to AllHipHop: "With the release of "Gravity", I really wanted to expand on my previous work while still making sure to keep it all very authentic to who I am as an artist as well as a person[.] When I released "Church Clothes" earlier this year, it was the precursor of what's come with this album. It introduced my music to new audiences, allowing me to impact others."
Recording and production.
Lecrae stated in an exclusive video with AllHipHop that after recording "Church Clothes" in March, he was on the road before beginning recording for "Gravity" in May. In an article by SOHH, Lecrae revealed that he had started work on the album in February, then wrapped up recording during the mid-year. The album was recorded over the next couple months at Music House Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. On July 10, 2012, Christian hip hop website Rapzilla reported that Lecrae had shot a music video with No Malice of Clipse and with his labelmate Tedashii. The report included photographs from the video set.
Much of the production on the album was handled by producers with whom Lecrae has worked with in the past, chiefly The Watchmen and Heat Academy. The Watchmen consists of the producers J.R., Alex Medina, and Wit while Heat Academy is led by Street Symphony. DJ Khalil, whose past production work includes "Recovery" by Eminem, produced the track "Mayday", which features Big K.R.I.T. and "American Idol" season 10 finalist Ashthon Jones. Tyshane, who previously contributed to a track from "Church Clothes", co-produced the song "Violence" with ThaInnaCircle. Other producers include Dirty Rice, DJ Official, Dru Castro, and Joseph Prielozny.
Besides Big K.R.I.T. and Ashthon Jones, the album also features appearances by "The Voice" finalist Mathai, Mali Music, and Reach Records artists Trip Lee and Tedashii. On working with Big K.R.I.T., Lecrae stated to "Billboard" that K.R.I.T. had already reached out to him before the collaboration to show his appreciation for Lecrae's honesty. In an interview with AllHipHop, Lecrae mentioned that both he and Big K.R.I.T. have similar backgrounds, having both grown up in the Southern United States and struggled with religion under the influence of a religious grandmother.
Promotion and marketing.
On May 31, 2012, Rapzilla posted an article featuring photos and tweets from the "Gravity" recording sessions. A teaser video for the album was released on YouTube on June 20, 2012, and announced that the album would be released in the latter half of 2012. On July 10, 2012, Family Christian made the album available for pre-order, and Rapzilla used this information to announce the following day that the release date was September 4, 2012. Also on July 10, Lecrae posted photos from his video shoot with No Malice and Tedashii. Rapzilla responded a few days later with speculation over the possibility that in one photo Lecrae's T-shirt bore the logo of "Gravity".
On July 17, 2012, Lecrae performed with his labelmate Andy Mineo at an Apple Store in SoHo, New York City. The performance included live renderings of songs from "Rehab" and "Gravity". The following day, Lecrae held an exclusive preview session of the album at The Cutting Room with his industry friends and select publications including AllHipHop and "Billboard". The cover art to "Gravity" was revealed the day after, along with an official announcement of the release date.
The lead single from the album, "I Know", was released on July 24, 2012, as a complimentary free download upon pre-ordering of the album. On July 27, 2012, "Billboard" reported about "Gravity" in its daily news show "The Beat". Rapzilla also made the single available for streaming on SoundCloud. On the same day, the album's tracklist was revealed. The music video for "Lord Have Mercy" was released on August 1, 2012. On August 7, 2012, a deluxe version of "Gravity" was made available for preorder on iTunes. This version includes three bonus songs featuring appearances from Suzy Rock, Tenth Avenue North, and KB, and according to Rapzilla, the album already reached the No. 9 spot on the iTunes Hip-Hop/Rap Chart. Later the same day, the deluxe version moved up the No. 2 spot on the iTunes Hip-Hop/Rap Chart and No. 18 overall on iTunes. On August 14, 2012, Lecrae launched a website for the album, and released the single "Tell the World" featuring Mali Music on August 15, 2012. According to a photo posted on Lecrae's Instagram account, on August 15, 2012, Lecrae held another private listening session at New Era Flagship Store in Atlanta. On August 23, 2012, Rapzilla reported that Lecrae had shot a music video with Mali Music for the single "Tell the World". The following day, a promotional video for the album, entitled "It All Comes Down", was released. The fourth single for the album, "Mayday", featuring Big K.R.I.T. and Ashthon Jones, was released on August 30, 2012. The music video for "Tell the World" was released on October 19, 2012, and announcements were been made that Lecrae had filmed music videos for "Fakin'", featuring Thi'sl, and "Mayday". The video for "Mayday" aired December 13, 2012 on the MTV Networks channels MTV Jams, mtvU, and MTV2. On February 1, 2013, Lecrae released the music video for "Fakin'" on MTV and MTV2, and it quickly reached No. 1 on the MTV.com Top Video Picks. Lecrae released the fifth and final music video from the album, "Confe$$ions", on April 30, 2013, on BET's 106 & Park It features an acting appearance by David Banner.
Lyrics and style.
When asked what sets "Gravity" apart from his previous releases, Lecrae stated that "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written some of the best lyrics I've ever written." Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that ""Gravity" is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." He described that "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only for a short period of time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us of who we are in Jesus." "Billboard" stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for "Gravity" and "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." AllHipHop described the album as opening with "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". "I Know" was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while "Mayday" was considered one of the most "organic" sounding tracks. "Violence" was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as "caribbean-esque" with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for "Lord Have Mercy" was released, an article in "The Christian Post" article compared the song to the Kanye West single "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that "like Kanye West's song, "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone." It noted the appearance of No Malice in the video, stating that "the chorus seems to sample his voice."
Artwork and packaging.
In a blog for the "Houston Chronicle", hip-hop writer Sketch the Journalist posted an article on the cover and promotional artwork for "Gravity". He compared the cover as a combination of those from "Quarantine" by GRITS and "Get Rich or Die Tryin by 50 Cent, and compared the promotional art to that of Braille and S1's "CloudNineteen". Sketch subsequently updated the post based off a reader comment, and added the cover of De La Soul's ' in combination with the promo art for "CloudNineteen" in his comparison of "Gravity"'s cover art.
Touring.
Three release parties were held for the album. The first occurred on September 28, 2012, in Manchester, United Kingdom, followed by Denver, Colorado on the 27th and Houston, Texas, on the 28th.
In support of the album, Lecrae toured with his entire label roster, consisting of Tedashii, Trip Lee, KB, Andy Mineo, and PRo, along with special guests Propaganda and Thi'sl. The tour ran from October through November and stopped at 30 cities across the United States and Canada.
Reception.
Commercial reception.
Upon its release, "Gravity" debuted at No. 3 on the "Billboard" 200, with 72,000 units sold. This set a career high for Lecrae, whose previous highest sales week was 27,000 units with "Rehab", and was the best sales week ever for a Christian hip hop album. By September 23, 2012, the album had sold 103,000 copies. In the first week of sales, the iTunes deluxe edition of the album reached number No. 1 on that vendor's hip-hop/rap albums chart, while the regular version of the album came in second place, a feat that prompted writ-up on Lecrae in "Time". Rapzilla initially reported that the deluxe edition of the album had also reached the No. 2 spot on the overall iTunes album chart, and this report was subsequently updated to reflect deluxe version of "Gravity" reaching No. 1 on that chart. In addition, the bonus song "Fuego" from the deluxe edition reached No. 5 on the iTunes top hip-hop/rap songs chart. The song charted at No. 20 on the "Billboard" Top Heatseekers Songs, No. 13 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Digital charts, and No. 64 on the Hot Digital Songs charts. According to Inquisitr, in the same week of the release of "Gravity", the iTunes version of "Church Clothes" jumped to the No. 4 spot on the top hip-hop/rap albums chart. As of November 28, 2012, the album has sold 150,000 copies in the U.S.
Critical reception.
Both AllHipHop and "Billboard" were very positive toward "Gravity" after a preview listening session, considering it Lecrae's strongest and most mainstream work to date. AllHipHop stated that "overall, it appears that Lecrae is ready to offer one of his most broad and, dare-we-say, mainstream albums in terms of sound; yet, it still manages to capture the trueness of what he has always stood for and rapped about. If anything, Gravity is a giant step forward for his expanding career, and it will surely be a welcome addition to many 'Top 10' lists when 2012 comes to a close." Indie Vision Music in announcing the cover of "Gravity" called the album "likely the biggest Christian hip hop album yet". AllHipHop listed "Mayday" as one of the standout tracks on the album, noting the "beautiful" melody and hook by Ashthon Jones. The reviewer considered "Violence" a personal favorite, calling Lecrae's line "Grew up under Tupac, bible verse and two glocks" one of the most powerful lines on the album. "Parlé Magazine" also was favorable to the song, stating "That track is definitely going places." Jonathan Landrum of "The Associated Press" was favorable to the album, saying that "in his sixth album 'Gravity,' Lecrae delivers a strong piece of work. He's not afraid to rap about his past mistakes, supplying inspirational rhymes filled with Christian values backed by well-produced secular hip-hop beats." In its track-by-track review of the album, "The Boombox" stated that "based on the warm reception to Church Clothes, this LP is set to stir the pot further in the realm of both of hip-hop and Christianity." David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, declaring that Lecrae makes "Gravity"'s various genre experiments and jumps in style "sound effortless and natural". He asserted that "while Rehab is the more rewarding album in the end, this one is more persuasive and immediate, making it an easy entry point into this gifted artist's discography."
In an initial review by Jesus Freak Hideout, Kevin Hoskins rated the album four out of five stars, calling the album solid but finding that the album's R&B passages "pale in comparison to the other tracks stylistically and are not necessarily needed." Hoskins listed the songs "Falling Down," "Power Trip," "Lord Have Mercy," and "I Know" as some of the best tunes, and called "Lucky Ones" a "perfect song." New Release Tuesday called "Gravity" one of the most anticipated releases of the year. In its review, the site gave the album four out of five stars, stating that the recording in many ways lives up to the anticipation, but had three or four too many songs that detract from the album's whole. Rapzilla was very favorable to the album, rating it four-point-five out of five and calling it the most important album in the history of Christian hip hop. The reviewer, Armond Goss, listed the tracks "Lord Have Mercy", "Fakin'", and "Buttons" the low points on the album, but said that those were the only problems that they found. "Confe$$ions", "Power Trip", and "Gravity" were all listed by as extremely strong, but Goss considered the track "Mayday" as the best track "sonically, lyrically and conceptually" on the album, stating that DJ Khalil's production work "provides the perfect backdrop for K.R.I.T. to walk into your church in the middle of service and express his frustrations with hypocrisies and for Crae to walk in behind him and calm the mob down while still co-signing K.R.I.T.’s verse." The "Houston Press" summarized the album by stating that "by and large, Gravity acts and dresses like a stand along rap album built from the same organ drenched and string heavy foundation that Houston's style of G-funk did in the '90s. It's another "heavy" rap album to drive away from the same escapism tactics rap loves to dwell in."
At "CCM Magazine", Andy Argyrakis said that Lecrae has "officially arrived as the top star in the scene", and that the artist has "his finger on today's production trends (and certainly being ahead of the curve on a few occasions), his rhymes are packed with so much authenticity that even the most mainstream-minded listener has the potential to connect." Anthony Peronto of Christian Music Zine rated the album 4.75 out of five, and said that "loosely inspired by the book of Ecclesiastes, Gravity is so far the most important CHH album ever made and bridges the gap between Christian and the secular rap scenes." At Cross Rhythms, Steve Hayes wrote that this is Lecrae's "finest project to date", called it "brilliantly produced explosively impacts the listener", and said the release would be "enjoyed for years to come." New Release Tuesday's Mark Ryan noted that "there are 3 or 4 songs too many on the album that detract from the album as a whole", which is the reason he did not "get overly excited", but he did affirm that "fans and newcomers alike will enjoy the album".
Awards.
"Gravity" won Best Gospel Album for the 2013 Grammy Awards. "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" reported this as the first time a Christian hip hop artist has ever received a Grammy. In October 2013, it won the Dove Award for Rap/Hip Hop Album.
Initial release competition with T.I..
On July 19, 2012, Rapzilla posted an article entitled "Is Lecrae and T.I. similar to Kanye vs 50 Cent?", which noted that "" by T.I. was scheduled for release the same day as "Gravity". The article speculated that the potential cultural impact of "Gravity" could be like that of Kanye West after his 2007 competition with 50 Cent. The writer, Steven Patton, stated that "we "may" be on the cusp of another watershed moment this coming September. Two artists living in Atlanta and largely the front runners of two different ideologies are releasing a new album on the same day." A few hours after being posted, the article was updated stating that the release date for "Trouble Man" was being pushed back to September 19. However, the release date was subsequently returned to September 4, before T.I. announced that he was pushing the album back indefinitely. "Trouble Man" ultimately was released on December 18, 2012, and debuted at No. 2 on the "Billboard" 200, selling 179,000 copies.
"Gravity: The Remix EP".
On December 26, 2012, DJ Official and Alex Medina released a remix version of the album, "Gravity: The Remix EP", as a free digital download. It features the producers Gawvi (formerly known as G-Styles), Big Juice, D-Flow, Black Knight, and Tyshane.

Sammy Chand

Sammy Chand is a record producer, soundtrack composer, artist, and entrepreneur. He is also the founder of Rukus Avenue, a South Asian record label based in Los Angeles, CA.
Career.
Sammy has transformed both the musical landscape and the South Asian community with a storied career spanning over two decades. In 1996, he laid the foundation for Rukus Avenue, as an independent record label and platform for an emerging scene of South Asian musicians in North America. This seminal company was at the forefront of a community-driven movement to establish a new identity for South-Asian Americans, that were charged with the task of reconciling traditional cultural values with American ones. Chand had made a name for himself in the world of film and television through a lengthy list of placements. Under his leadership, the label gained an international presence, beginning with a landmark distribution deal with Sony Music in India and a more recent global agreement with The Orchard. 
Early releases such as Passage to India (Various, 2001) and The Movement (Karmacy, 2005), helped to cement Chand’s status as dynamic music producer and cultural ambassador. His solo debut, Tale of a Crown (2010) further demonstrates his ability to pair original musical elements found in South Asian music with a variety of other genres - a Chand signature. 
Throughout his career, Chand and his music have built a formidable bond with the film and television community. His notable placements include CBS News, PBS, The Oprah Winfrey Show, America’s Most Wanted, Leela, So You Think You Can Dance?, Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations and the Weather Channel’s Storm Riders. In 2008, he partnered with the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles to bring a live musical component to the festival that would properly articulate the intimate relationship between music and film in Indian Cinema. The IFFLA Rhythm Village and IFFLA Rhythm Village Unplugged under his direction, have become highly popular additions to the annual festival. 
Today, Chand is further advancing this movement and his sound with the third generation of Rukus Avenue artists. He is currently producing the debut from Elephants With Guns, an eclectic band that, “collects music, sounds and noises from different parts of the world, wraps them in twine, and presents them to you.” He is also currently writing and recording material for Blood and Treasure, the follow-up to Tale of a Crown. Chand currently resides in Los Angeles.

Treaty of Asebu

The Treaty of Asebu was concluded in 1612 between the Dutch Republic and the chiefs of Asebu on the Gold Coast of Africa. The treaty was the first among several concluded between the Dutch and the peoples of the Gold Coast, and marked the beginning of a 260 year period of Dutch presence on the Gold Coast.
History.
Although no copy of the treaty survived, it likely allowed for the establishment of Fort Nassau near Mouri. The story goes that the king of Asebu sent two envoys by the names of Carvalho and Marinho to the Dutch Republic to confirm the treaty. The fact that both men had Portuguese names suspects that they were local Christian African-Portuguese mulattos. Evidence for this early African embassy to the Dutch Republic is only circumstantial, however. No hard proof exists of these men visiting Europe.
The conclusion of this treaty should be seen in the light of the Twelve Years' Truce (1609-1621) between Portugal-Spain and the Dutch Republic. Under the terms of the treaty, the Dutch were forbidden to trade in areas occupied by either Spain or Portugal. The Portuguese claimed the entire Gold Coast as theirs; by concluding this treaty, the Dutch, who had been trading on the Gold Coast since the 1590s, laid their claim on a part of the coast as well.

Starlet (film)

Plot.
Jane (Dree Hemingway) is a presumably unemployed young woman who lives in an apartment with her two dysfunctional roommates, Melissa (Stella Maeve), Melissa's boyfriend Mikey (James Ransone), and her Chihuahua dog Starlet. Jane decides that she wants to make the room more her own by painting it and buying new furniture. Melissa says the room can't be painted because Mikey needs it for "shoots". Jane decides to save money by buying new furniture at some neighborhood yard sales. After picking up items from other yard sales that day, she comes across one of an old woman named Sadie (Besedka Johnson). She buys a thermos from her and goes back to the apartment to decorate her room. 
While listening to an argument between Melissa and Mikey, she discovers a stash of money while cleaning the thermos. She spends some of the money on personal things such as an elaborate manicure, new clothes, and a blinged out leash for Starlet. However, she decides to return the money to Sadie, but when she goes to Sadie's house to try and return it, Sadie dismisses her. Jane keeps the money for herself and decides to follow Sadie as she takes a cab heading to the grocery store. While Sadie is shopping, Jane decides to pay the cab and send it away so she can offer Sadie a ride, which Sadie reluctantly accepts. The two women spend time together in Sadie's house, and Jane gives her number to a skeptical Sadie and tells her to call her if she needs anything.
Jane then joins Sadie the next day at bingo because Sadie said the previous day that she plays every Saturday. Jane once again pays off Sadie's taxi so she can drive her home. On the way Jane asks an innocent question, which prompts Sadie to mace Jane thinking she's only a scam artist. The two talk to the police and Jane explains that she is just being friendly, then leaves visibly angry. Sadie calls Jane the next day wanting to reconcile after she realized that Jane was just being a friendly samaritan. Over the next several days, Jane spends more time with Sadie and learns that she's a widow and she adores Paris but has never been.
Melissa is fired from her job but after Jane convinces their boss to reconsider, he decides to freeze Melissa from work for a month. It is discovered that Melissa and Jane are adult film stars and Jane consequently gets a promotion over Melissa. While Jane is at work, she leaves Starlet with Sadie, and Sadie eventually loses sight of the dog while tending to her garden. Sadie desperately sets out to look for Starlet and finds him. When Jane arrives to retrieve Starlet, Sadie seems troubled and wants to put an end to their friendship, which upsets Jane. After having a talk with Melissa who says she should spend the money on someone else instead of herself, Jane, to make Sadie feel better, and reconcile their friendship, buys two first class tickets to Paris for Sadie and herself and books a week at a fancy hotel, using the money she found in the thermos. When Jane tells Sadie of the trip she has planned for them at a bingo game, Sadie refuses to go. Wanting Sadie to go on the trip, knowing she would love it, she convinces Sadie that if she wins at bingo then Sadie has to go on the trip. Jane buys 25 bingo cards but loses because Sadie wins after a dry spell of a year and a half. Even though she lost, Jane still tries to convince Sadie to go, which she ultimately agrees to.
Back at the apartment, Melissa lashes at Jane after finding out she spent all the money on Sadie instead of her. Jane strikes back at Melissa who then kicks Jane out of the apartment. While Jane is at work, Melissa goes to Sadie's house and tells her about the stash of money which is the reason that Jane was being friendly to her. However, Sadie isn't taken aback as to what Melissa has to say. Later, Jane, unknown of Sadie's knowledge about the money, picks her up from her home to go to the airport. Sadie tells Jane to stop and deliver the flowers at the cemetery to pay tribute to her husband. Jane places the flowers and notices the grave of Sadie's deceased daughter alongside her husband. She then gets back to Sadie and drives away.

<doc id="36535856" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36535856" title="German submarine U-209">
German submarine U-209

German submarine "U-209" was a Type VIIC U-boat of the "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 28 November 1940 by the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft yard at Kiel as 'werk' 638, launched on 28 August 1941 and commissioned on 11 November under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Heinrich Brodda.
She was lost in May 1943, possibly due to a diving accident.
Operational career.
"U-209" began her service career as part of the 6th U-boat Flotilla for training, she then commenced operations with the same organization on 1 March 1942. She was re-assigned to the 11th flotilla on 1 July 1942. She was with the 1st flotilla until her loss on 7 May 1943. She carried out a total of seven patrols and was a member of nine wolfpacks.
1st patrol.
She made the short journey from Kiel to the German island of Helgoland and then departed on her first patrol on 15 March 1942. She headed north, into the Norwegian Sea, then east. The boat was attacked by the armed trawler on the 28th ; but conditions were so bad that the ship could not use her armament because it was frozen. Depth charges were little better, at least one malfunctioned.
The submarine also came under attack from two minesweepers, and in the Barents Sea on the 29th. "U-209" escaped.
2nd patrol.
The boat's second sortie began in the Norwegian port of Kirkenes in the far north of the country. She patrolled the vicinity of Bear Island, then sailed south and southwest, before docking in Bergen, also in Norway.
3rd and 4th patrols.
Her third and fourth patrols, in June and July 1942, covered the Norwegian Sea and the passage between Bear Island and Svalbard, it saw her depart Bergen and return to Kirkenes.
5th patrol.
The boat attacked a small Soviet convoy on 17 August 1942, near Mateev Island in the eastern Barents Sea. She sank the "Komiles", the "Komsolec", "SH-500" and "P-4", (two tugs and two barges), with her gun.
6th and 7th patrols and loss.
Patrol number six, at 35 days, was her longest. It took her northwest of Bear Island.
By now the boat had returned to Kiel, from where she departed for the last time on 6 April 1943. She was attacked by a British B-17 Flying Fortress of No. 220 Squadron RAF southeast of Iceland, on the 16th, sustaining damage to her periscope. She was also attacked by a Canadian PBY Catalina (known as a Canso) of No. 5 Squadron RCAF on 4 May. The damage incurred included her radio transmitter, so a message to "Bdu" (U-boat headquarters), was sent via . "U-209" was recalled, but she was never heard from again; her loss might be explained by a diving accident. Whatever the reason, forty-six men died; there were no survivors.
Afterword.
"U-209" was originally thought to have been sunk by the frigate and the sloop on 19 May 1943. This attack was responsible for the demise of . "U-209" was nicknamed "Brno" by the south Moravian town in where the crew took a holiday in February 1943. They were invited by "SS-Sturmbannführer" Konrad Nussbaum, chief of Brno Kripo, whose son was one of the crew. Brno municipality received as a gift a model of the submarine (photos exist) but the model itself was probably lost after the end of WWII.

<doc id="36535890" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36535890" title="Film applicator">
Film applicator

A Film applicator is a device used to spread a substance, such as paint, ink or cosmetics, evenly over a substrate. A standard procedure for testing substances that are applied in a liquid form, and then dry to a solid film, is to create a controlled, standardized test film of the substance, usually on a standardized substrate, such as a metal, plastic or paper panel. To provide the uniform film thickness, a Film applicator is normally used to maintain a constant film thickness. The applicators are used to spread a substance such as paint, ink or cosmetics, evenly over a substrate such as a drawdown cards. The applicators are usually metal bars with that are manufactured to high tolerances to give consistent, repeatable results. These applicators can either be used manually or by automatic film applicators. Each bar will give a "theoretical wet film thickness" or, in other words, the thickness of the coating that should remain on the drawdown card after application. Even with high manufacturing tolerances, the actual "wet film thickness" can vary from 50% to 90% of the gap. There are multiple kinds of bar applicators, their forms and uses are shown below. Film applicators follow the ASTM standard D823.
Types.
Four-sided applicator.
Used for high viscous coatings, this type of applicator has four different clearances built in, one on each horizontal surface.
Applicator frame.
Used for low viscous coatings, this applicator also has four different clearances built in. It is used for non-rigid substances and has a two sided opening in the center of the bar.
Bar type or Bird applicator.
This applicator has one, two or four clearances and contains a slanted trailing edge, also used for high viscous coatings. This is the most common type of film applicator.
U shaped.
This applicator also has two clearances but features a U-shaped form instead of a straight bar.
Square applicator or Octoplex applicator.
The square applicator is the more versatile than previously mentioned applicators. It has 8 clearances in the form of a square frame. This tool combines the accuracy of fixed applicators with the versatility of adjustable applicators.
Film applicator knife.
This adjustable applicator has a metal frame with an adjustable "knife" that acts as the gap clearance. These applicators are the most versatile manual applicator, but is also the least precise.
Wire-wound applicator.
These applicators differ from the bar applicators as they consist of a metal rod wound with wire of varying thickness. The coating will pass through the gaps between the wires and level off at a uniform thickness.
There are two main types of wire bars. Close wire wound bars will produce coating layers from 4 to 120μm. Higher coating thickness up to 500μm can be obtained using open wound bars.

Battle Nations

Battle Nations is a freemium turn-based strategy video game developed and published by Z2Live. There are over five million players worldwide.
Development.
"Battle Nations" is Z2Live's third game, following "Trade Nations" and "MetalStorm". Z2Live released a video that described the inspiration behind the creation of Battle Nations. The concept for the game was inspired by "Trade Nations" users who provided feedback requesting additional PvP elements in the game.
Gameplay.
The game puts players in control of land with limited resources where effective management of resources is vital to expansion and advancement. Building a productive nation allows players to form armies which are the basis for the game's core: PvP combat in turn-based strategy warfare. It is impossible to "lose" in Battle Nations: even if the player has no buildings to generate gold, the player will always have enough gold to build a supply drop, which generates 100 gold every hour as well as 25 of iron, wood, and stone. Most of the technology in game is based on that used by humans during WW2, although there are a few exceptions (e.g. velociraptors, mammoths, lasers, swords, railguns, etc). The game seems to lack logic in various areas, allowing players to grow crops in 5 minutes while in real life crops take months to grow, as well as a man with a pistol hiding behind a scrap car door being more dangerous than an imperial soldier with a shotgun and military grade steel shield.
Units.
There are over 115 different units that are used for war. The Trooper is the most basic, being able to fire once with a rifle. The Mega Tank is generally accepted as the strongest unit. It has the most HP and armour combined. In fact, the Mammoth Tank (a promotional premium unit) has the most HP and armour combined. Some units can do "damage over time", or DOT. These include the Flame Trooper, which burns the opponent, and the Dustwalker, which can poison the opponent. Players are able to train animals which can be used in battles, such as the War Mammoth and Battle Raptor. Sandworms are another type of critter (or animal) unit. Players can also train Raiders, Silver Wolves, Bigfoots and units with Laser Weapons to fight for them. Update 3.0 introduced air units and anti-air units.
Nerf.
Z2 over the years nerfed a lot of units, Boom Bus (reduced damage and stun chance), Wimps (limiting them to 3 per battle) and all planes (they were immune to poison, stun and freeze).
Nerfed Units:
Aircraft (No longer immune to stun, poison or freeze as of update 3.2)
Aircraft (No longer immune to poison or freeze as of update 3.2)
Aircraft (No longer immune to stun or poison as of update 3.2)
Characters.
Unlike most games of its type, "Battle Nations" has an in-depth plot centering on a civil war in a fictional country inhabitited not only by humans, but also velociraptors, mammoths, boars, and sandworms. 
Empire.
The protagonist nation of the game, ruled by a benevolent emperor, Hendrik II.
95th Rifles.
The division that the player (known as "The Captain") is in charge of.
Frontier.
Other outposts near the player's outpost.
Raiders.
The Raiders are a band of violent, merciless savages who thrive on death and destruction. They attack the player mainly because they have set up on what they consider to be their land. They are a parody of the Tusken Raiders from "Star Wars".
Hostile Raiders.
Most of the Raiders are very hostile and territorial.
Raider Allies.
Not all of the Raiders are out to kill you. During the early stages of the game, the player comes across a splinter group of peaceful Raiders lead by Elder Taos. Raiders from the Raider Sanctuary can be trained for use by the player at the Raider Training Camp (apart from Allied Dustwalkers and Mammoth Riders, who are trained in the Prestigious Academy).
Rebel Army.
Born during the rule of Emperor Tragan, the Rebels seek to overthrow Hedrik II. They are led by former Imperial General Ashe. They are the main antagonists of the game (even though the first chapter of the game is focused almost entirely on the Raiders). At the end of the first chapter, it is revealed they launched a surprise assault on the capitol, killed Hedrik II, and began committing unspeakable atrocities. Though they seem to be a parody of the Rebel Alliance from "Star Wars", their brutal ways make the Empire look heroic.
Silver Wolves.
A group of renegade Imperials closely associated with the Rebels. Much of their weaponry is very ragtag, such as cannons being mounted on schoolbuses and thuggish outfits. They are motivated by money.
The player can train allied Silver Wolves in the Mercenary Vault.

A Year Ago in Winter

A Year Ago in Winter () is a 2008 German drama film directed by Caroline Link. It is based on the novel "Aftermath" by American author Scott Campbell, tellings the story of a "complicated family situation". The painting featured in the film was made by the Munich artist Florian Sussmayr. The film score is composed by Niki Reiser.
The film was premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, and its theatrical release was on 13 November 2008.
Plot.
The Munich-based interior designer Eliane commissions the painter Max Hollander to portrait her children Alexander and Lilly. Eliane wants it as a memorial of Alexander, who took his life about a year before. She provides pictures and videos of him for the painter. She wants Lilli to sit for a double portrait, but she is disgusted by the idea to have her dead brother on the wall "for decoration". Unlike her mother, she is not disciplined and loses her leading role at the Theatre Academy because of disputes with her teacher. She tries unsuccessfully to find closeness and intimacy in her relationship with the artist Aldo.
At the sessions with Max, Lilli is reserved at first whereas he seeks to look behind her facade and capture her character in the painting. He recognizes the profound relationship between the siblings and understands Lilli's realm of feelings better and better. Thereby he also is able to connect to the personal losses in his own history. The relationship between painter and model deepens, and they trust each other more and more.
The resulting portrait does not meet Eliane's expectations, but breaks her reservations regarding Lilly. She is able to begins to cope with the death of her son. Lilly accepts that she will not figure out the reason of her brother's suicide, and is then able to forgive him.
Themes.
The film deals with the processing of a family catastrophy and the grief it causes. The story does not aim to resolve the mystery of the suicide, but concentrates on the development of Lilly, a process triggered by the painter. It does not show the typical affair between an artist and his model, but "eine behutsam in Halbschritten der Zuneigung erzählte Geschichte von tröstlicher Nähe, die beiden guttut" ("gently told, a history of half-steps of affection, of a comforting closeness that is good for both). The completed portrat captures the past, but on the other hands points to a future for which Lilly is ready now.
Awards.
Caroline Herfurth was awarded with the Bavarian Film Award for "Beste Nachwuchsschauspielerin" (best upcoming actress), and the Preis der deutschen Filmkritik. The film was nominated for the Deutscher Filmpreis in the categories Bester Spielfilm (best feature), Bester Hauptdarsteller (best main actor) and Bester Schnitt (best editing). Film composer Niki Reiser was awarded the prize.

<doc id="36536096" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36536096" title="German warship Uj-2210">
German warship Uj-2210

Uj-2210 was an auxiliary warship of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" that was in service during the Second World War. She served as a submarine hunter ("U-jager") under Otto Pollmann, Germany’s most decorated anti-submarine warfare officer. "Uj-2210" was sunk in the Mediterranean in May 1944.
Early history.
"Uj-2210" was built as the French trawler "Marcella" in 1933 at the ACL/CAP shipyards at St Nazaire. With a Gross Register Tonnage of 1152 tons she was an ocean-going trawler and was employed in France’s deep sea fishery.
The outbreak of the Second World War and the Fall of France found "Marcella" in the Mediterranean, where she remained until 1942.
Service history.
In November 1942 Germany invaded Vichy France, and "Marcella" was seized by the "Kriegsmarine" for conversion as an anti-submarine naval trawler. 
On completion she was commissioned by Lt. Otto Pollmann and in the 15 months under his command, claimed 14 Allied submarines destroyed, although only one of these, (HMS "Tigris") can be substantiated. Pollmann was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his efforts.
Pollmann and "Uj-2210" were credited with the sinking of HMS "Tigris" in a post-war evaluation. On 27 February 1943 "Uj-2210" was escorting a convoy south east of Capri and made an attack on a submarine contact. This produced signs of a successful attack (oil and an air bubble): "Tigris" failed to return to base on 6 February and "Uj-2210’s" contact and attack was deemed the most likely to have been responsible for her loss.
Following Pollmann’s promotion and departure, "Uj-2210" continued anti-submarine activities, but with no further success reported.
Fate.
On 28 May 1944, while in the Ligurian Sea, "Uj-2210" was spotted and attacked by American motor-topedo-boats. She was hit by a torpedo and sank off Deiva Marina, breaking in two.
Wreck.
The wreck of "Uj-2210" lies at a depth of 68 m and is a popular (though dangerous) wreck site for sport divers.
The stern is resting on the sea bottom, while the stem of the ship is standing vertical, rising 25m from the sea bottom. However the wreck is in a fishing ground and is surrounded by discarded fishing nets, making any approach hazardous, while the depth requires specialized breathing arrangements.

<doc id="36536119" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36536119" title="ResearchGate">
ResearchGate

ResearchGate is a social networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers, ask and answer questions, and find collaborators.
Corporate history.
ResearchGate was founded in 2008 by a virologist and computer scientist, Ijad Madisch. It started in Boston, but moved to Berlin, Germany shortly afterwards. In 2009, the company began a partnership with Seeding Labs, in order to supply third-world countries with surplus lab equipment from the United States. Its first round of funding was announced in September 2010.
According to "The New York Times" the website began with very few features, then developed over time based on input from scientists. Adoption of the site grew rapidly. From 2009 to 2011, the site grew from 25,000 users to more than 1 million. The company grew from 12 employees in 2011 to 70 in 2012.
A second round of funding led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund was announced in February 2012. 
On June 4, 2013, it closed Series C financing for $35M from investors including Bill Gates.
Features.
The New York Times described the site as a mashup of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. It has many of the features that are typical among social network sites, such as user profiles, messages that can be public or private, and methods for finding other users with similar interests. It differs from other social networks in that it is designed for researchers and scientists. Conversation strings focus on a research interest or paper and you can "follow" a research interest, in addition to following individual users. It has a blogging feature for users to write short reviews on peer-reviewed articles. ResearchGate indexes self-published information on user profiles to suggest members to connect with that have similar interests. When a user posts a question, it is fielded to scientists that have identified on their user profile that they have a relevant expertise. It also has private chat rooms where scientists can share data, edit shared documents, or discuss confidential topics.
As of 2013, it has 2.6 million users. ResearchGate's largest user-base is in Europe and North America. Most of ResearchGate's users are involved in medicine or biology, though it also has participants from engineering, computer science and agricultural sciences among others. Participants can get a higher "score" which ranks their "scientific reputation" by providing popular answers to questions and other metrics.
Members are encouraged to share raw data and failed experiment results. ResearchGate does not require peer review or fees. Since accessing documents usually requires an account, ReseachGate is not considered to be open access.
Reception.
As of 2009, according to "BusinessWeek", ResearchGate was influential in promoting innovation in developing countries by connecting scientists from those nations with their peers in industrialized nations. "BusinessWeek" said the website had become popular largely due to its "navigation" and "ease of use". It also noted that ResearchGate had been involved in "a string" of notable cross-country collaborations between scientists that led to substantive developments. A paper published in the "The International Information & Library Review" conducted a survey with 160 respondents and found that out of those using social networking "for academic purposes", Facebook and ResearchGate were the most popular at the University of Delhi, but also "a majority of respondents said using SNSs Networking Sites may be a waste of time".
In 2011, a University of Florida librarian conducted an evaluation of ResearchGate. The librarian answered 211 questions and obtained 293 followers. According to the "Norton Journal of the Medical Library Association", ResearchGate users "provided invaluable feedback" for "evaluating three existing LibGuides" and the experiment found that librarians can develop real-world recognition among their peers for their contributions to the site. In a paper published by the Association for Information Systems an experiment involving a dormant account found that over a 16 month period, using default settings, ResearchGate sent 297 invitations to 38 people. These emails are written as if they were personally sent by the user, but they are automatically sent to co-authors when a user posts an article in their profile unless they opt out. The user profile was automatically attributed to more than 430 publications. It followed or was followed by more than 450 users, though the profile was inactive. Journalists and researchers have found that the "RG score," calculated by ResearchGate via a proprietary algorithm, can reach high values under questionable circumstances.
ResearchGate has been criticized for emailing unsolicited invitations to the coauthors of its users as well as for encouraging authors to upload articles to the site, which may infringe the copyright of the publisher.

I'm with You Sessions

"I'm with You Sessions (also known as I'm with You Singles Collection") is a group of nine singles by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers featuring seventeen songs recorded in contention for the band's tenth studio album, "I'm with You" (2011). The singles will also be released as a double LP vinyl set, entitled "I'm Beside You", in November 2013 and will be exclusively sold only on Record Store Day.
Produced by Rick Rubin, each release contains two songs featuring an a-side and a b-side and they are available worldwide through 7" vinyl and digital download.
Background.
During a Q&A on May 5, 2012, Chad Smith announced through his Twitter page that the album's unreleased songs would eventually see the light of day. On May 27, 2012, Smith said in response to a tweet that, at some point in the next six months, the band would be releasing ten unreleased songs on 7-inch and as digital downloads. Flea followed up Smith's announcement a few days later on May 29, 2012 by stating that eighteen unreleased songs from the "I'm with You" sessions would be released over the next six months. He also confirmed that the band has been writing new music while touring.
Josh Klinghoffer commented on the unreleased songs by saying "Finding songs that seem to want to join hands with others is a special task that require the right people...and the right songs! Some songs seem to have a lot more of an agenda than others. Some songs play well with others and some songs need more attention and a little extra care. Here are some songs that seemed to want to pair up and take a later train. Keep your eye on them, they're up to something..."
Smith said in July 2012 of the unreleased songs that "We just wanted them to come out because we just really like them. We didn't want them to get lost, so we're gonna put them out, mainly for our fans. They would've waited for the Warner Bros. box set in, like, 2020, if there's even a record company around then. I'm glad they're going to see the light of day because it's an important part of the band and what we were doing at the time." On the sound of the songs, Smith says he finds it "hard to explain" what the first two songs to be release sound like but describes "Long Progression" as "kind of a flowing, kind of midtempo funk". He also stated the band is currently working on new music. "Those are just waiting," Smith said. "We'll go back to those when we start writing again, I'm sure – or not. We're just always trying to come up with new stuff; usually the latest and greatest is what we use, but you never know."
Writing and composition.
All of the seventeen songs were recorded during the sessions for "I'm with You". "Long Progression", the b-side to "Strange Man" which was the first single released, almost made the album's final cut but was left off in favor of "Goodbye Hooray". One of the songs, "In Love, Dying" is an eight-minute rocker captured in a single studio take that occupies both sides of a single, as Klinghoffer told Rolling Stone from a recent tour stop in Berne, Switzerland. “We’re going to have to do that old trick where it fades out and fades back in on the B-side.” Another cut, “Victorian Machinery” “sounds like a big three-headed monster playing drums,” Klinghoffer said, adding that the band captured “absolute magic” with “Never Is a Long Time,” a “pop-tastic” number featuring Greg Kurstin on piano. “It’s really one of those cases where they had too many good songs to fit on an album. They have this cohesive thing in the studio – when they get that take, that’s the take that they keep.”
“It’s always difficult, but we use a democratic process and the songs with the most votes are usually the backbone of the album,” producer Rick Rubin wrote in an email. “I can just say as is always the case, some of my personal favorites don’t make the cut. I’m sure everyone in the band can tell you the same.”
Klinghoffer said that they recorded 48 songs during the album's sessions and some could eventually see the light of day. “It’s possible,” Klinghoffer said. “We just had so much material back then that certain things just straight-up didn’t get enough attention. There’s a couple that will probably just remain in our iPods.”
Artwork.
Each of the nine seven-inches feature cover artwork by Kelsey Brookes, and when combined together, form one larger piece of artwork. The artwork is titled "Iris" and featured in Brookes' new "Meditations on Symmetry" series currently on display in Malibu, California. Brookes' well-documented background in microbiology, surf culture and folk art combine in explosive prisms of raucous color, bold imagery and timeless motifs. His work has appeared in countless group shows, art fairs, and magazines such as GQ, Modern Painters, Juxtapoz, Beautiful Decay and "Dazed & Confused". However, the artwork was sightly modified for the singles release, by rotating the image 45 degrees.
The back cover of each release features handwritten lyrics by vocalist and lyricist Anthony Kiedis.
Track listing.
All songs written and composed by Anthony Kiedis, Flea, Chad Smith & Josh Klinghoffer
The first eight songs are also featured on the "I'm with You – Australian Tour Edition" which was released on January 11, 2013 exclusively in Australia to promote the band's 2013 tour dates in that country. The first disc features the "I'm with You" studio album and the second features the first eight songs released from the "I'm with You Sessions". The band will also release "I'm Beside You" on November 29, 2013 as a Record Store Day exclusive release. It will contain all seventeen songs on a double vinyl LP.

Demographics of Goiânia

The demographics of Goiânia is a field of study and knowledge about the characteristics demographic municipality of Brazil in Goiânia, capital of the state of Goiás.
Despite being among the youngest capitals of Brazil, only being older than Brasília and Palmas, Goiânia is currently the twelfth most populous municipality in Brazil with 1,318,148 inhabitants, after eleven capitals. One of the facts is due to the large area of the municipality, which is expanding and being less than 210 km from the federal capital, so that throughout history, the two cities to develop mutually. However, the Metropolitan Area of Goiânia, composed of 20 municipalities and a population estimated at 2,206,134 inhabitants, is the tenth largest urban agglomeration in Brazil.
Ethnic groups.
Goiânia is a multiracial city as the result of intense migration. The first settlement was made gradually attracted mainly by migrants from the interior of Goiás, and other regions in other states, mainly in the south and southeast. According to a survey in 2010, most migrants are from Minas Gerais, Bahia, Tocantins, Maranhão, São Paulo and Pará.
Religion.
Like the cultural variety verifiable in Goiânia, there are various religious manifestations present in the city. According to data from an estimate in 2002 of the PUC-GO, the municipality's population is composed mostly of Catholics (65.8%), evangelicals (26.3%), spiritualists (3.6%) and atheists (0, 9%).

St Edmund's Church, Southwold

St Edmund's Church, Southwold is a Grade I listed parish church in the Church of England in Southwold.
History.
The parish church of Southwold is dedicated to St Edmund. It is considered to be one of Suffolk's finest. The church lies under one continuous roof. It was built over about 60 years from the 1430s to the 1490s, and replaced a smaller 13th-century church that was destroyed by fire. The earlier church dated from the time when Southwold was a small fishing hamlet adjacent to the larger Reydon. By the 15th century Southwold was an important town in its own right, and the church was rebuilt to match its power and wealth.
The church is renowned for its East Anglian flushwork, especially that of the tower. Knapped and unknapped flints are arranged in patterns, textures and designs and create the stone work. The curving letters over the west window are most famous: "SCT. EDMUND ORA P. NOBIS" (St Edmund pray for us). Each letter is crowned, and set in knapped flints. The church has a copper clad roof with an easily recognisable flèche (or spirelet), above a clerestory of eighteen windows. The flèche was purely for display, and has never contained a bell. The tower has no parapet and is a very fine piece of architecture, with its large bell openings. The roof of the nave is so high that it makes the tower seem shorter than it really is; but it is at least 100 feet high. All of the church's medieval glass was destroyed by William Dowsing in 1644; the only stained glass windows in the church are the east windows over the altar (1954, by Sir Ninian Comper) and the west window below the grand tower. In World War 2 the church was narrowly missed by a German bomb that destroyed houses in the nearby Hollyhock Square. The bomb did not do much damage to the building itself but blew out most of the windows - another reason why the church has very little stained glass. The church was tidied very quickly for the funerals, a short while later, of the people killed by the bomb.
In the interior, the rood screen is considered by many to be the finest in the county. It stretches all the way across the church, and is made up of three separate screens: a rood screen across the chancel arch and parclose screens across the north and south chancel aisles. A 15th century clock jack stands at the west end. He has an axe and bell which he uses to strike the time, and has a twin at Blythburgh. The Southwold jack is named "Southwold Jack", and is one of the symbols of the Adnam's brewery. The font has been badly mutilated but is still very impressive with its large ornate cover. The roof in the chancel is painted and its height gives the church a very open feeling.
Present-day church community life is extremely diverse and makes good use of St Edmund's Hall (also destroyed during the Second World War and rebuilt) to the rear of the church.
Restorations.
The roofs were restored in 1857 by Edward Lushington Blackburne and in 1866-1867 by Richard Phipson. The chancel was restored in 1885.
Bells.
Southwold tower contains a ring of eight bells hung for change ringing. The tower held five bells in 1553. Over the years these bells have been recast and others added to create the current eight. The current fourth and fifth are probable recasts of the originals, having been cast in 1668 by John Darbie of Ipswich. The third dates from 1820 and is by William Dobson of Downham Market. In 1828 one bell was recast and a further two added. The bell that was recast is the present tenor, also by William Dobson. The sixth and seventh were added and are likely to originate from All Saints, South Elmham. Both are medieval bells, the sixth being cast around 1538 by William Barker and the seventh by Brasyers of Norwich around 1513. The two trebles date from 1881 and are by Moore, Holmes & Mackenzie of Redenhall, Norfolk. However, a peal of Oxford Treble Bob Major was rung on 26 July 1858, indicating that the tower possessed a ring of eight prior to 1881.
The tenor (the largest) weighs 10¾ cwt or about 546 kg, and the treble (the lightest) about half of that. The bells hang in a timber frame installed in 1897 by George Day & Son of Eye, Suffolk. In 1990 the bells were rehung on new fittings and the frame strengthened by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. There is a large amount of space surrounding the frame, allowing ease of access and maintenance. The clock uses the seventh bell to strike the hours. There are no bells in the tower other than the ringing peal. The bells are rung from a ringing chamber some 52 steps up the tower. The chamber has many mementos of past campanological achievements. The tower is affiliated to the Suffolk Guild of Ringers. The bells are rung regularly for Sunday services, weddings and other special occasions.
Organ.
The church has a three manual pipe organ by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd dating from 1887. A specification may be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.
Parish status.
The church is in a group with the following churches:

Palatinerpeton

Palatinerpeton is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibian.
Phylogeny.
"Palatinerpeton" is one of several Late Carboniferous and Early Permian European temnospondyls with uncertain affinities; the others include "Iberospondylus", "Sclerocephalus", and "Cheliderpeton". Phylogenetic studies have placed them as either early representatives of a group called Stereospondylomorpha, or close relatives of a group called Eryopidae. Stereospondylomorpha is a large clade mostly made up of Mesozoic taxa, while Eryopidae is a small family consisting of several Carboniferous and Permian temnospondyls. These two groups are usually considered distantly related. Schoch & Witzmann (2009) conducted a phylogenetic analysis in which Eryopidae and Stereospondylomorpha were found to be closely related, both members of a clade called Eryopoidea. "Palatinerpeton" was found to be the sister taxon of Eryopoidea. Below is a cladogram from their study:

Anton Suryapin

Anton Suryapin (born c. 1992) is a Belarusian photojournalist. On 13 July 2012, he was detained after publishing pictures of a protest by a Swedish advertising company in which teddy bears were airdropped into the country with slogans advertising freedom of speech.
The teddy bears were dropped on 4 July 2012 by Studio Total, a Swedish advertising firm. The group called the mission "Teddybear Airdrop Minsk 2012". A plane piloted by Tomas Mazetti took off from a town near Kaunas, Lithuania, and illegally entered Belarusian airspace, proceeding over the town of Ivyanets. The group then released 1,000 teddy bears holding cards and banners with protest slogans. When the Belarusian government denied that the incident had taken place, Studio Total released 90 minutes of footage of the flight, which Radio Free Europe reported that they had confirmed with experts had not been doctored. On 26 July, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko acknowledged the drop had occurred as reported.
Following the drop, Suryapin posted photographs on his website that he said had been e-mailed to him by an Ivyanets resident. On 13 July, his home was searched, his computer confiscated, and he was detained as an accomplice. On 19 July, Studio Total founder Per Cromwell published an open letter in which he stated that the group "never told Anton Suryapin or indeed any other Belarus citizen in advance about what we planned to do. We love (respect) and admire them too much to expose them to such risks." The letter also 
called Lukashenko an "armed clown".
On 24 July, Suryapin still had been not been released from prison, leading BBC News and other sources to conclude that charges had been filed against him, as Belarusian law only allows ten days of detention without charge. Amnesty International described the arrest as "a further nail in the coffin of freedom of expression and association in Belarus", and named Suryapin a prisoner of conscience. Index on Censorship described the case against Suryapin as "ludicrous", stating, "Not for the first time, the authorities in Belarus have found someone to blame for something they say hasn’t happened." The Committee to Protect Journalists called the charges "senseless" and called for Suryapin's immediate release.

Federal Medical Center, Butner

The Federal Medical Center, Butner (FMC Butner) is a United States federal prison in North Carolina for male inmates of all security levels who have special health needs. It is part of the Butner Federal Correctional Complex and is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice. An adjacent satellite prison camp houses minimum-security male inmates.
FMC Butner is located near the Research Triangle area of Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill.
Facility and programs.
FMC Butner has a full hospital facility and has the only residential program devoted to the treatment of sexual offenders in the federal prison system.
Butner study.
In 2009, a study conducted by psychologists Michael Bourke and Andres Hernandez was published in the "Journal of Family Violence." The results suggested a strong link between viewing child pornography and sexual abuse. The findings went against the conventional and widely held belief that while abhorrent, a person passively viewing child pornography had an insignificant causal link with that person actually molesting a child.
In what is known as the "Butner Study," Bourke and Hernandez analyzed data on 155 men convicted of child pornography offenses, who took part in an 18-month treatment program between 2002 and 2005, during which the men filled out assessment measures including a "victims list," where they revealed the number of children they had molested in the past.
74% of the men denied molesting anyone when they were sentenced. However, by the end of treatment, 85% had admitted to sexually molesting a child at least once. The numbers are more than twice that of other studies. In explaining this discrepancy, Bourke said, "Our treatment team worked for an average of 18 months with each offender, and the environment was one of genuine therapeutic trust" that encouraged the men to tell the truth about themselves.
Notable incidents.
In October 2012, the oldest inmate in the federal prison system, Drayton Curry, inmate # 24017-037, died at FMC Butner at age 92. Curry was serving a life sentence for a 1992 drug trafficking conviction and had petitioned US President Barack Obama for clemency in February 2011 due to old age and poor health. Advocates of prison reform cited Curry's situation as a reason for reconsidering mandatory minimum federal drug sentences.

WBWL (FM)

WBWL (101.7 FM; "101.7 The Bull") is an American radio station licensed to serve the community of Lynn, Massachusetts. Established in 1963, WBWL is owned by Clear Channel Communications and serves the Boston metropolitan area. The station broadcasts a country music format. The station's studios are located in Medford and the transmitter site is atop One Financial Center in downtown Boston.
History.
"For a more detailed history, see WFNX"
WBWL signed on August 5, 1963 as WLYN-FM, owned by Puritan Broadcasting Service along with WLYN (1360 AM). At the outset, WLYN-FM largely simulcast its AM sister station during hours in which the AM was on the air. During the 1970s, the simulcast was cut to drive time, with WLYN-FM brokering the remaining time to ethnic programmers; by 1974, the station's English-language programming included country music. Although WLYN changed its call letters to WNSR in 1977, WLYN-FM retained its call sign, but dropped the "-FM" suffix; both changes were reversed on December 31, 1979.
WLYN-FM began to devote its nighttime programming to new wave music in 1981; the following year, the station had become a full-time modern rock station known as "Y102," with the ethnic programming moving to the AM station. In September 1982, Puritan announced that it would sell WLYN-FM to Stephen Mindich, publisher of the "Boston Phoenix"; the station eventually became part of the Phoenix Media/Communications Group. Mindich retained the modern rock format upon assuming control in March 1983, relaunching it on April 11 as "Boston Phoenix Radio," with the WFNX call letters coming into use ten days earlier. WFNX would subsequently become one of the earliest alternative rock stations.
WFNX broadened its focus to Greater Boston after the sale to Mindich, opening a sales office at the "Phoenix" offices in Boston, but its studios remained in the same building as WLYN in Lynn. The station did move its transmitter from WLYN's tower in Lynn to Medford in 1987 and to One Financial Center in Boston in 2006 to provide a better signal within the market; from 1998 to 2006, a translator station, W276AI (101.3 FM) was operated from the John Hancock Tower to improve WFNX's reception in Boston, but was discontinued when the move to One Financial Center rendered it redundant. During 1999 and 2000, Phoenix Media/Communications Group also acquired WCDQ (92.1 FM, renamed WPHX-FM) in Sanford, Maine, WNHQ (92.1 FM, renamed WFEX) in Peterborough, New Hampshire, and WWRX-FM (103.7 FM) in Westerly, Rhode Island to serve as WFNX simulcast stations. WWRX-FM was sold to Entercom, eventually becoming WVEI-FM, in 2004, while WPHX-FM was sold to Aruba Capital Partners, becoming WXEX-FM, in 2011. Even with these expansions, WFNX broadcast at a lower power than other Boston market stations, limiting WFNX's signal in the outer portions of the market.
Phoenix Media/Communications Group announced on May 16, 2012 that it would sell WFNX to Clear Channel Communications, after finding it difficult to sustain its continued operation. WFEX was sold to Blount Communications, which would rename that station WDER-FM the next day. Live programming ended on July 20, 2012, with the last song being "Let's Go to Bed" by The Cure (the first song on WFNX in 1983); an automated version of WFNX remained available online until March 2013, when the "Boston Phoenix" publication shut down (citing huge financial losses), and was also heard on 101.7 FM until 4:00 PM on July 24, when Clear Channel assumed control of the station. At that time, after playing "Shake It Out" by Florence and The Machine, 101.7 began stunting with a loop of the Boston-famous song "Dirty Water" by The Standells. At approximately 4:28 PM, WFNX relaunched as WHBA, an adult hits station branded as "101.7 The Harbor." The first song on "The Harbor" was "Sweet Emotion" by Aerosmith. The launch of WHBA marked the return of the adult hits format to the Boston market; a similar format aired on WMKK (93.7 FM) from March 2005 until it became WEEI-FM in September 2011.
On December 20, 2012, at 6 PM, the station flipped to dance, branded as "Evolution 101.7;" the format had been launched as an online station on Clear Channel's iHeartRadio service six weeks earlier. The final song on "The Harbor" was "Sweet Caroline" by Neil Diamond, while the first song on "Evolution" was "Don't You Worry Child" by Swedish House Mafia. As "Evolution," the station claimed to be "the first real EDM station in the country." The call letters were changed to WEDX on January 2, 2013. On January 14, 2013, Sisanie, who provides voicetracks for several top 40 and rhythmic top 40 stations also owned by Clear Channel (including WEDX's sister station WXKS-FM), became the first "airstaffer" to be added to WEDX's daily lineup, voicetracking in afternoons. In December 2013, the station began simulcasting on WXKS-FM's HD2 channel, which previously broadcast an all-comedy format. The move was because of WEDX's limited signal, which is nulled to the south to protect Providence-based sister station WWBB (101.5 FM).
On June 13, 2014, at Noon, after playing "How You Love Me" by 3LAU, WEDX began airing a country music stunt and asking listeners to go online and use the hashtag "#CountryOn1017" to vote on what artists the station should play. At 3 PM, WEDX officially flipped to country, branded as "101.7 The Bull". The first song on "The Bull" was "This Is How We Roll" by Florida-Georgia Line. The new format competes against established country station WKLB-FM (102.5 FM), and serves as the Boston affiliate of the syndicated "Bobby Bones Show". "Evolution" remains available through WXKS-FM's HD2 channel, the iHeartRadio mobile application, and in early-morning blocks on Saturdays and Sundays on WXKS-FM. The call letters were changed to WBWL on June 30, 2014 to match the new format.

She won the Triangle Talent Search in September 2010, released an award-winning music video in October 2011, and was named Best Singer by the local "Yes! Weekly" in March 2012. She possesses a wide vocal range and plays many instruments. Her music has been called “carnival folk, fairytale pop and gypsy jazz” and was described by the BBC as “a pleasant kind of bonkers.”
Education & awards.
Bright was born in Annapolis, Maryland and raised in Mount Pleasant, North Carolina, where she began taking music lessons at the age of seven. After performing in numerous high school musicals, Bright studied Drama before earning a Bachelor’s degree in Anthropology from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. She then earned a Master’s degree in Ethnomusicology from Florida State University while performing in a variety of genre-spanning acts.
Inspired by P.J. Harvey, Björk, Tori Amos, Tom Waits, Yann Tiersen, Gotan Project, Lhasa De Sela and The Tiger Lillies, Bright played in Mariachi, Balinese Gamelan, Chinese, Ugandan, Brazilian Samba and Indonesian ensembles. After graduate school, Bright traveled the world where she studied flamenco dancing in Spain, worked for the Montana Conservation Corps in Yellowstone National Park, and became further acquainted with other cultures and their music.
She won the Triangle Talent Search in September 2010 and was named Best Singer by the local "Yes! Weekly" in March 2012. Her singing has been described as “captivating and mysterious,” featuring her “mystical, even otherworldly” vocal inflections. Her “operatic voice teems with ethereal beauty” and she plays many unusual instruments, including a musical saw, accordion, keyboards, concertina, adungu (Ugandan harp), bombo (Argentinian drum), zheng (zither), piano, guitar and vihuela.
Bright is a certified Holistic Health Coach / Nutritionist with a degree from the Institute for Integrative Nutrition in New York City. She practices through her company [http://crystal-bright.healthcoach.integrativenutrition.com Crystal Bright Holistic Health.
Art & theater projects.
Bright acted, sang and played music in two collaborations with mixed media sculptor Grey Pascal at Acme Art Studios in Wilmington, NC. “20/20: Filters of Light and Insight” was a 3D performance art piece which debuted on May 28, 2010 with a theme that revolved around two mythological lovers striving to express divine beauty. “Downward Spiral” took place on October 15, 2011 and illustrated the metamorphosis of a girl into a woman who exudes creative power.
Bright wrote, directed, produced and starred in the musical interpretive movement theater production “Illuminating and Transcending the Shadow,” which featured her performing with her band the Silver Hands and a cast of 16 costumed actors. The whimsical yet impassioned production chronicled the journey of conquering the self-imposed oppression that holds people back. The show was co-produced by Rusty McDonald of DividingMe Photography. The show debuted at the Broach Theater in Greensboro, NC in October 2010 with three further performances at the Greensboro Fringe Festival's 10th Anniversary Showcase at the Cultural Arts Center's City Arts Studio Theater in January 2012.
Bright co-produced and starred in “Bones & Lilies,” a collaboration with members of The Flowjo Family Circus which combined a musical concert with experimental theatre, performance art, interpretive dance, and circus arts including acrobatics, aerial silks, hooping, belly dance, juggling, stilt walking and a fire processional. There were two performances on March 2 and 3, 2012 at The Flowjo in Carrboro, NC.
Crystal Bright & the Silver Hands.
Founded in Greensboro, North Carolina in 2010, Crystal Bright & the Silver Hands take their name from a classic piece of folklore by The Brothers Grimm. “There is a story called ‘The Handless Maiden’,” Bright said, “and it is about her losing her hands and gaining them back in the end, representing her coming into her full creative and soulful self, which I felt like I was doing then, and am still doing.” “I had written all these songs and I needed help in creating a band and taking my music to the next level. The Silver Hands help me create something bigger than my own hands could.”
Compared to Kate Bush, Gogol Bordello, Danny Elfman, and Amanda Palmer and Brian Viglione's The Dresden Dolls, Bright creates “a haunted, whimsical, multicultural sonic cabaret” - “the sound of dark fairy tales” and “European carnivals.” They deliver a “grand sense of theatricality” with Bright’s unusual and unexpected arrangements and time signatures. One reviewer wrote that “the Silver Hands understand the importance of a little chaos... especially among such beautifully orchestrated music.”
With songs deeply rooted in folktales, fables, myths and dream archetypes, Bright’s lyrics and melodies portray the world as a dark, strange and often funny place. She prefers to write about society and culture rather than relationships. A major inspiration is the book “Women Who Run With Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype” by Clarissa Pinkola Estes. Song topics include twists on Hans Christian Andersen’s Little Match Girl and The Ugly Duckling, the Slavic witch Baba Yaga, and the Inuit folk tale of the Skeleton Woman.
As of September 2012, Bright, along with various Silver Hands, have performed 225 concerts, including shows with Adam Arcuragi, The Love Language, Larkin Grimm, and Pearl and the Beard. Bright collaborated and performed with the North Carolina Symphony on an arrangement of her song "Toy Hammer" for their 2010 New Year's Eve program at Meymandi Concert Hall in Raleigh, NC.
Albums.
Their self-titled debut album "Crystal Bright & the Silver Hands" was released in June 2010 to reviews praising its “experimental vaudeville” and “twisted carnival folk.” Their second album, "Muses & Bones", was released in March 2012. It was mastered by Grammy Award-winning engineer Gene Paul (son of legendary guitarist/inventor Les Paul) at G&J Audio. It was described as “stunningly beautiful,” filled with “power, grace and style,” and “a record for freaks and thinkers, healers and hippies, the cool and the curious and for people who just want a little more.”
Video.
The video for "Drowned Out", from their second album, "Muses & Bones", won the Best Overall Video award at the HearNC Music Video Festival at Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, NC in December 2011 and won DrunkenMermaid’s Video Battle of the Bands in June 2012. It was screened at the Indie Grits Film Festival as part of the Shuffle Magazine Showcase at the Nickelodeon Theatre in Columbia, SC in April 2012 and at The Carrboro Film Festival at the Carrboro Century Center in Carrboro, NC in November 2012.

2012–13 Irish League Cup

The 2012–13 Irish League Cup (known as the Irn-Bru League Cup for sponsorship reasons) was the 27th edition of Northern Ireland's secondary football knock-out cup competition. It was contested by the twelve members of the IFA Premiership, as well as the 29 members of the IFA Championship. The competition began on 14 August 2012, and ended with the final on 26 January 2013.
Crusaders were the defending champions after defeating Coleraine 1–0 in the 2011–12 final. They reached the final again this season, but were unable to defend the trophy as they were defeated 4–0 by Cliftonville in the final, who lifted the cup for the second time. This made it six different winners of the cup in the last six seasons. The 4–0 scoreline equalled the record for the highest in a final, set when Linfield defeated Coleraine by the same score in 2000.
Format.
The competition was played in a straight knock-out format and was open to all members of the IFA Premiership and both divisions of the IFA Championship. Twenty clubs from the IFA Championship entered in the first round, with the remaining ten Championship clubs given byes into the second round. They were joined by the twelve members of the IFA Premiership. Newry City were expelled from the IFA this season and their result in the second round match against Dergview was expunged from the records. Replays were not used in the competition - all matches used extra time and penalties to determine the winner if necessary.
First round.
The draw for the first round was made on 24 July 2012. The games were played on 14 August 2012. The first round draw was made randomly and included all 29 clubs from the IFA Championship. 20 of those clubs were drawn to face each other with the remaining 9 receiving a bye into the next round.
Armagh City, Ballymoney United, Bangor, Carrick Rangers, Coagh United, Dundela, Institute, Killymoon Rangers, and Limavady United all received byes into the second round.
Second Round.
The draw for the second round was also made on 24 July 2012. The games were played on 27 August 2012. The draw was later revised, switching some venues to the club originally drawn to play away from home.
The 12 members of the IFA Premiership entered the draw at this stage, along with the 10 winners from the first round matches, and the 9 clubs that received byes. Dergview were effectively given a bye to the third round, after their 2–1 second round victory over Newry City was later expunged from the official records. The draw was seeded so that the IFA Premiership clubs and the top 4 clubs from last season's second tier (IFA Championship 1) avoided each other.
Third Round.
The draw for the third round was made on 29 August 2012. Six clubs from IFA Championship 1 made it through to the third round along with the ten remaining clubs from the top flight, but none made it through from Championship 2. The matches were played on 9 October 2012.
Quarter-finals.

Killer on the Loose

"Killer on the Loose" is a song by the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, written by Phil Lynott, released as a single in September 1980. It was a chart hit, peaking at No.10 in the UK and No.5 in Ireland. It later appeared on their 1980 album "Chinatown".
Controversy.
The song, in which Lynott took the persona of Jack the Ripper received much controversy. The single was released amidst the Yorkshire Ripper murders and many members of the British public, largely women, were outraged by the songs lyrics and its references to the Ripper. A music video, in which Lynott is dressed in a Ripper style trench coat surrounded by scantily clad women, generated even more controversy when it was released in 1980.

East River Esplanade

The East River Esplanade, also known as the East River Waterfront Project, consists of along the East River waterfront between the Battery Maritime Building east of Battery Park in Manhattan's Downtown Financial District to Pier 35 by Montgomery Street in the Lower East Side. The project aims to rehabilitate the existing waterfront space and connect it to two existing waterfront parks, Battery Park and East River Park. Upon completion in 2013, the East River Esplanade is slated to feature two rebuilt piers, new glass pavilions underneath the elevated FDR Drive, new biking lanes and waterfront seating.
History.
The East River waterfront in Lower Manhattan was known for heavy maritime activity, with over 40 piers in operation by the later 1950s. The busy waterfront provided easy access to New York Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean in the south, the Hudson River on the west, with a connection to the Erie Canal. However, the rise of truck traffic and the transfer of port activity to the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal drastically reduced maritime traffic on the river after the middle 20th century. With many piers now defunct, ambitious plans have been made to reclaim and reuse the pier space. The north-south arterial highway, the FDR Drive was moved to an elevated location to allow convenient access to the piers. In the 1970s, the Water Street Access Plan was drafted to extend the confines of the traditional Financial District eastward and create a new business corridor along Water Street, south of Fulton Street. Noting the success of the World Financial Center, the East Side Landing plan was created in the 1980s to add commercial and office buildings along the waterfront, again south of Fulton Street, similar to Battery Park City. This plan never materialized.
In 1982, there was a plan to expand the Seaport Museum of New York and attract tourist activity. Parts of the district were devoted to retail, including the main building of the Fulton Fish Market. A modern shopping mall was then built on Pier 17 and was open in September 11, 1985. Furthermore, the Fulton Fish Market formerly located around South Street and Fulton Street, was pressured to relocate in 2005 to Hunts Point in The Bronx due to plans for the redevelopment of the Manhattan waterfront. 
During Mayor Bloomberg's tenure as mayor, he spearheaded the PlaNYC 2030 initiative, which highlights projects and plans to transform the city by the year 2030. An important focus was put on the waterfront, including the East River waterfront. Bloomberg also stressed the importance of ferry transport, as an alternative to existing land transport options. The Pier 11/Wall Street ferry terminal has long operated East River waterfront, with regular trips to New Jersey. In June 2011, a ferry service to piers on Brooklyn's waterfront started. 
The East River Greenway, a pedestrian and bike path, was established in the late 1990s between Montgomery Street in the Lower East Side and Broad Street in the Financial District. Benches were also added along the partially restored waterfront. The pedestrian path/bikeway has been well received by community members. Drawbacks exist however:
Planning and construction.
SHoP Architects led the design process in the creation of the East River Esplanade, consulting community members during the planning years between 2002 and 2006. A year-long study was undertaken in 2004, allowing designers to derive ways that would "enhance waterfront access". Other groups critical to the project's planning phase include the New York City Department of Transportation, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Economic Development Corporation, the Department of City Planning and other agencies and groups. $137 million was secured with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, and work began on a "pilot section" in 2009 between John Street and Wall Street.
Project description.
According to the Department of City Planning, the overall plan is listed as:
The FDR Drive viaduct will be clad, and South Street will be narrowed for much of its length to make room for additional sidewalk space. The glass pavilions will be located underneath the viaduct, and the bike lanes would be moved to the side of the pavilion, underneath the FDR Drive. The piers would be reconstructed to encourage marine growth, by having reef balls to attract fish populations.
Access to the Esplanade from the neighboring areas would be undertaken with the redevelopment of "slips" - wedge-shaped road shapes which previously allowed ships to berth. Some of these slips have been used as parking facilities, while others are the southern termini for critical north-south thoroughfares. Reconstructions of the existing slips in the Financial District, the Lower East Side and Chinatown will feature bikeways and landscaped medians. Five of these slip projects are at varying stages of construction. From east to west, they are
Montgomery Slip,
Rutgers Slip,
Pike/Allen Slip,
Peck Slip, and 
Burling Slip.
Phases.
The project is being undertaken in 3 phases, with first phase completed (including Pier 15). Second phase construction started in summer 2011 (from Old Slip to the Battery Maritime Building). Construction on the third phase (Pike Slip to Pier 35, Montgomery Slip) began in fall 2011. This phase will last until 2014 and will cover the rehabilitation underneath the FDR Drive from Maiden Lane to Pier 35.
Storm barrier.
There are plans for a new storm barrier along the southern third of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway (of which the East River Esplanade is a part), between West 57th and East 42nd Streets. The final proposal, which is geographically U-shaped, will include many features. Under the elevated FDR Drive structure above South Street will be storm barriers hanging from the viaduct's ceiling, which will drop down in case of a storm. A "Battery Berm" will be located at Battery Park, and a maritime museum will be opened on the site of a former Coast Guard building there. The proposal, by Rebuild by Design, will also include components for storm barriers in Hunts Point, Bronx and on Staten Island. 
The first component, a barrier on the East River Esplanade in the Lower East Side between Montgomery and East 13th Streets called "The Bridging Berm", will cost $335 million. In addition to storm protection, the berm—the first of three of the barrier's components—will also provide a pedestrian pathway and bikeway on top of berm, boating and fishing docks, a slope down to current sports fields, upgraded ADA-accessible ramps for bridges across the FDR Drive, and construction materials such as "slurry walls, concrete blocks, a compacted embankment, a clay cap, topsoil and salt-tolerant landscaping." The total cost of the project is over $3.5 billion.

The Kingsmen in Person is the first album by the rock band The Kingsmen, released in 1963. The album featured Louie Louie, the band's biggest success. Jack Ely, the singer of Louie Louie, appeared on no other track on the album because he quit before it was recorded.
Release and reception.
The Kingsmen recorded "Louie Louie" at Northwestern Inc. recording studio on April 6, 1963. After being reissued by Wand, "Louie Louie" debuted in the "Billboard" Hot 100 at #83 on November 9 and quickly began ascending the charts. Trying to capitalize on the success of the song, the Kingsmen decided to release an entire album, and gigs at the Chase nightclub were booked on November 15 and 16 to record what was to become "The Kingsmen in Person.". Jack Ely, the singer of "Louie Louie", appeared on no other track on the album because he quit before it was recorded. Wand quickly released the album to make a dent in the Christmas purchasing season.
The album first appeared on the "Billboard" Top LPs on January 18, 1964, eventually peaking at #20 and remaining on the chart for over two years (131 weeks total) until 1966.
Jack Rabid of Allmusic awarded the album 3.5 stars and said: "From "Mojo Workout" to "Night Train" to "Money" to the instrumental "You Can't Sit Down," the keyboards swirl above the stomp of the rhythm section and guitars, and it still makes people want to get drunk and go nuts. The band is primitive, sure, but boy does the spirit feel like a hot time."
The LP was released in both mono (WDM 657) and stereo (WDS 657) versions. In 1993 Sundazed and Bear Family reissued the album on CD with bonus tracks "Haunted Castle", "The Krunch", and "(You Got) The Gamma Goochee".

Benjamin Carpenter (British Army officer)

Benjamin Carpenter (born circa 1713/14-died 8 March 1788) was a British soldier and courtier.
The son of Colonel Robert Carpenter, who was killed at the head of the 3rd Foot Guards at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745, Benjamin Carpenter was for many years an officer of the 2nd Troop of Horse Guards, in which corps he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In November 1760 he was promoted to the rank of colonel, and appointed aide-de-camp to the King. He was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1762, and obtained the colonelcy of the 12th Regiment of Dragoons in 1764, from which he was removed to the 4th Regiment of Dragoons on 24 October 1770.
He was a great favourite with King George III, to whom he was made an equerry on 16 December 1760. He was appointed clerk marshal of the mews on 6 April 1771 and principal equerry in the royal establishment on 1 January 1783. Carpenter was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1772, and to that of general in 1783. In the seventy-fifth year of his age he became so depressed in spirits that his medical attendant directed his servants to watch his motions narrowly, but he eluded their vigilance, and proceeding to Hyde Park, about five o'clock in the morning of 8 March 1788, drowned himself in the Serpentine river.
Benjamin Carpenter was married to Mary, youngest daughter and co-heiress of Lieutenant-Colonel Timothy Carr; they had two daughters:
The two daughters were the subject of a 1771 portrait in crayons by Pierre-Joseph Lion.

Virginia elections, 2013

The following offices were up for election in the United States Commonwealth of Virginia in the November 5, 2013 general election.
The Republican Party selected its statewide ticket at a convention in May 2013. Primaries were held on June 11, 2013, in which the Democratic Party selected its ticket, and contested races for party nominations were decided.
Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected governor with 48% of the vote to 45% for Republican Ken Cuccinelli. Democrat Ralph Northam was elected lieutenant governor with 55% of the vote to 45% for Republican E.W. Jackson. In the Attorney General election, Democrat Mark Herring beat Republican Mark Obenshain by 1,103,777 votes to 1,103,612 - a difference of 165 votes out of more than 2.2 million cast, or 0.007%. After the State Board of Elections certified the results, Obenshain requested a recount, which began on December 16. Obenshain conceded the election on December 18, and later that day, the recount ended with Herring winning by 907 votes, or 0.04%.
Governor.
The incumbent Governor, Republican Bob McDonnell, was not eligible to run for re-election due to term limits established by the Virginia Constitution. Virginia is the only state that prohibits its governor from serving immediate successive terms.
Republican candidates.
Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli had both indicated that they were running for the Republican Party's nomination for Governor. Bolling withdrew from the race on November 28, 2012, making Cuccinelli the de facto nominee. Cuccinelli was formally nominated at the state convention on May 18, 2013.
Democratic candidates.
Terry McAuliffe, former Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a candidate in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2009, declared his intent to again seek the Democratic nomination in November 2012.
On April 2, 2013, The Democratic Party of Virginia certified that McAuliffe was the only candidate to file for the June primary, and was therefore the Democratic nominee.
Libertarian candidate.
Robert Sarvis, a lawyer and businessman, was nominated as the Libertarian Party of Virginia's official candidate on April 21, 2013, at a special convention.
Sarvis' campaign submitted over 17,000 signatures to meet the Virginia State Board of Elections requirement of 10,000 valid signatures. On June 26, 2013, the SBE confirmed to Sarvis' campaign that he would be listed on the ballot. This makes Sarvis the fourth minor party gubernatorial nominee to get on the Virginia ballot in the last 40 years.
Lieutenant Governor.
After Republicans took two seats in the Virginia Senate in the 2011 elections to bring the Senate to a 20–20 tie, Republican Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling gained significant power with his tie-breaking vote. "The Washington Post" reported in November 2011 that this led to increased interest and speculation as to who would run for the post in 2013.
Republican candidates.
E. W. Jackson, a pastor, conservative activist and candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2012 was nominated after four ballots at the Republican convention. He defeated former State Senator Jeannemarie Devolites Davis, State Representative Scott Lingamfelter, State Senator Steve Martin, Prince William Board of County Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart, Stafford County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Susan B. Stimpson and venture capitalist and Fox News commentator Pete Snyder.
Democratic candidates.
In the June primary, State Senator Ralph Northam defeated Aneesh Chopra, former Chief Technology Officer of the United States and Secretary of Technology under Governor Tim Kaine.
Attorney General.
Incumbent Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli did not run for re-election. The race was the most competitive of the three Virginia statewide elections. The Virginia State Board of Elections initially reported that Herring leaded Obenshain by 1,103,777 votes to 1,103,612 - a difference of 165 votes out of more than 2.2 million cast. The results were certified on November 25, declaring Herring as the winner by 165 votes. Obenshain requested a recount, and conceded on December 18, 2013, after Herring's lead grew in the recount to 810 votes.
Republican candidates.
On May 18, 2013, a Republican state convention in Richmond nominated state Senator Mark Obenshain of Harrisonburg over state Delegate Rob Bell.
Democratic candidates.
The Democratic primary was won by State Senator Mark Herring, who defeated former Assistant United States Attorney Justin Fairfax.
Results.
The results were certified on November 25, 2013, however Obenshain had requested a recount due to the close race, as Virginia law allows when the margin is under 1%.
House of Delegates.
Republicans currently hold 68 seats and Democrats hold 32 seats in the 100-seat House of Delegates.
Primaries.
Four incumbent Republicans were challenged in primaries that centered around Gov. McDonnell's controversial transportation funding overhaul that imposed a $1.2 billion per year tax increase. 34 House Republicans voted for the bill, causing an uproar amongst conservatives. No sitting Republican delegate had faced a primary challenge since 2005. In the June 11, 2013 primary, two veteran Republicans who supported the transportation plan were defeated: businessman Dave LaRock beat 33rd District Del. Joe T. May 57%-43%, and physician Mark Berg ousted 29th District Del. Beverly Sherwood by a 51%-49% margin. Both May and Sherwood held committee chairmanships; their ouster opens the chairmanships of the Transportation Committee (chaired by May) and the Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources Committee (chaired by Sherwood). House Speaker Bill Howell and Del. Bobby Orrock handily defeated their primary challengers.
In the Democratic primaries, Del. Rosalyn Dance staved off a challenge from Evandra Thompson, who said Dance voted with Republicans too often, winning by less than 300 votes. Del. Algie Howell easily beat his primary challenger.
Incumbents losing reelection.
Two incumbents lost reelection. Democrat Monty Mason defeated Republican Michael B. Watson in the 93rd district, while Democrat Michael Futrell defeated Republican Mark Dudenhefer in the second district.

Brian Wong

Brian Wong (born April 14, 1991) is a Canadian internet entrepreneur. In 2010, Wong co-founded Kiip, a mobile app rewards platform that lets brands and companies give real-world rewards for in-game achievements.
Early life and education.
Wong was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia. He is also of Hong Kong descent. His father was an accountant and his mother was a nurse. He received his high school diploma at the age of 14 after twice skipping two grades. Wong received a degree in Commerce from the University of British Columbia at the age of 18. While at university, Wong launched his first company, FollowFormation, which Mashable called "the easiest way to follow the top Twitterers by subject matter or topic." One of his most recent ventures, Kiip, made him one of the youngest internet entrepreneurs to raise venture capital.
In 2010, Wong worked for the business development of Digg, leading the development and release of the Digg Android Mobile App. He was retrenched after five months, an experience that eventually led to him opening his own business.
Kiip.
Wong received the initial inspiration for Kiip on an airplane as he observed his fellow passengers interacting with their iPads. He noticed that many passengers were playing games, and felt that the games' advertisements took up screen space without adding any real value. Because he perceived that games are a "holy grail of achievement," Wong wanted to leverage key moments of achievement—such as level ups and high scores—with a targeted, relevant rewards program that enabled brands to reach consumers when they were most engaged.
In July 2010, Wong teamed with his fellow former Digg employees Courtney Guertin and their mutual friend Amadeus Demarzi to found Kiip. Currently, Kiip is active on more than 400 apps on 30 million devices, and sends 100 million moments of achievement-based rewards notices to consumers monthly through its network. By mid-2012, Kiip had raised more than $15 million of venture capital from companies like Relay Ventures, Hummer Winblad, True Ventures, Verizon Ventures, CrossLink Capital, and others. Kiip has offices in San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Tokyo and London. The company has established strategic partnerships with more than 40 major brands, including 1-800-Flowers, Amazon.com, American Apparel, Best Buy, Carl’s Jr., Disney, Dr. Pepper, GNC, KY Jelly, Pepsi, Playboy, Popchips, Sephora, Victoria Secret, Vitamin Water and others.
Reception.
In 2010, Wong became one of the youngest company leaders to ever receive funding from a venture capital firm. He has spoken at several popular conferences, including TEDx and SXSW. In addition, Wong and Kiip have been profiled in such global publications as "Forbes", "The Wall Street Journal", "The New York Times", and "Inc." Magazine.

Roger Blough

Roger M. Blough (January 19, 1904 – October 8, 1985) was the chairman and chief executive of the United States Steel Corporation for 13½ years, from May 1955 through January 1969. In this position, he is best known for serving as the American steel industry’s principal spokesman when the industry clashed in April 1962 with President John F. Kennedy on the issue of commodity steel prices.
Biography and honors.
Blough attended Susquehanna University. 
When Time magazine featured Blough in July 1959, they drew attention to the challenges facing the steel industry in the late 1950s, including inflation and competition from non-U.S. steel exporters. He served as Chairman of The Business Council in 1961 and 1962.
As a consequence of this inflation, Blough told the White House in April 1962 that it was the intent of the U.S. steel industry to raise a basket of steel prices by a scale averaging $6.00/ton. President Kennedy believed that this price increase violated an unwritten agreement that he had brokered between the industry and the United Steel Workers union, and called a press conference in response, held on April 11, 1962. In nationally televised remarks, the President described Blough as one of: “a tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility. . . . Some time ago I asked each American to consider what he would do for his country and I asked the steel companies. In the last 24 hours we had their answer.” Blough and U.S. Steel rolled back the threatened price hike. 
Motor vessel "Roger Blough", an iron ore bulk carrier vessel built for U.S. Steel in 1968-72 and used starting in 1972 in Great Lakes service to transport taconite pellets from Lake Superior to ports on Lake Erie and Lake Michigan, was named in his honor. As of 2014 this vessel remains in service.

1936, The Spanish Revolution

1936, The Spanish Revolution is an album of songs and archival photographs related to the Spanish Civil War, recorded and assembled by Dutch anarchist punk band The Ex. The band released it in 1986, the 50th anniversary of the Spanish Revolution, on their own label as a square 7" (17.5cm) soft-cover book with two 45 rpm records. A 5" (12.5cm) hardcover edition was republished by AK press in 1997, replacing the records with a pair of 3" CDs. 
Background and book.
In 1936 two Spanish anarchist trade unions, the CNT and the FAI, waged a successful revolt against the fascist leadership of Francisco Franco, until Franco defeated the revolutionary forces in 1939 with the help of German and Italian troops. With further involvement from the Soviet Union, France, Mexico and Portugal, the conflict is widely regarded as the first battle of World War II. In wanting to highlight the original values and spirit of the revolution rather than the conflict and eventual defeat of anarchist forces, The Ex compiled 144 pages of previously unpublished photographs taken by journalists aligned with the revolutionary forces, along with several short essays about the revolution. Text appears in both English and Spanish.
Music.
For the double-single, The Ex recorded two Spanish language songs with music and lyrics originally sung by 1930s Spanish revolutionary forces and supporters. On the flip side of each single was an English langiuage song about the revolution. The 1997 CD reissue split the songs up similarly as 2 mini-CDs.
Musicians.

Reception.
"1936" was the first of The Ex's releases to gain some notoriety outside of the Netherlands, selling enough copies to reach No. 6 on the UK Indie Chart. AllMusic called the book a "powerful and enlightening visual document that casts a fresh light on a major historical event little understood in the United States," and said that The Ex's music "find them inviting the spirit of the revolution as if it occurred five minutes ago, not 50 years past."

Fabens Port of Entry

The Fabens Port of Entry, is located at the Fabens-Caseta International Bridge. It was established when the two-lane bridge was built by the International Boundary and Water Commission in 1938.
The port of Fabens was established by Executive Order 4869 on May 1, 1928, ten years prior to the construction of the first bridge, so it is likely there was once a ferry operation at this location. The original port facility, built in 1938 was used as recently as the mid-1990s, when CBP moved its operations to temporary buildings a short distance north of the bridge.
Replacement.
The Fabens Port of Entry is scheduled to be replaced by the Tornillo-Guadalupe Port of Entry, which has been built around a new six-lane bridge about 650 feet to the northwest of the existing crossing. Construction on the U.S. side began in July 2011, and the facilities were ready at the end of 2013. However, the Mexican side of the new border crossing has suffered delays due to lack of funding; construction on the Mexican side of the new bridge finally began in January 2014, with customs inspection facilities and road infrastructure still pending.

Under the provisions of the New York Constitution of 1846, 32 Senators and 128 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (four districts) and Kings County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all within the same county. 
At this time there were two major political parties: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The Democrats split over the slavery issue and presidential nomination. Two State tickets were nominated, one supporting Stephen A. Douglas for President, the other supporting John C. Breckinridge.
Elections.
The New York state election, 1860 was held on November 6. Gov. Edwin D. Morgan and Lt. Gov. Robert Campbell (both Rep.) were re-elected. The other two statewide elective offices were also carried by the Republicans. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor was: Republican 358,000; Douglas Democratic 294,000; and Breckinridge Democratic 19,000. 
Sessions.
The Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in Albany on January 1, 1861; and adjourned on April 16.
DeWitt C. Littlejohn (R) was re-elected Speaker with 90 votes against 31 for Francis Kernan (D).
On January 16, the Legislature elected Benjamin F. Bruce (R) as Canal Commissioner, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Commissioner-elect Samuel H. Barnes (R).
On February 5, the Legislature elected Ex-Supreme Court Justice Ira Harris (R) to succeed William H. Seward as U.S. Senator from New York for a six-year term beginning on March 4, 1861.
On February 8, Ephraim Goss (R) was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate "for this day."
On February 19, Jay Gibbons (D) asked the Assembly to appoint a Select Committee to investigate allegations that he had "corruptly solicited a consideration for his official action in regard to a bill now pending before this House, to increase the salary of the assistant district attorney of the County of Albany." Speaker Littlejohn appointed assemblymen Bingham, Tuthill (both R), Hutchings, Kernan and Taber (all three D) to this Committee. Mitchell Sanford and Theophilus C. Callicot appeared for Gibbons's defence during the proceedings.
On March 7, Peter P. Murphy (R) was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate "for this day." On the same day, a Committee was appointed to "enquire and report whether it be necessary to appoint a President pro tempore, or whether the President pro tempore chosen at the previous session holds his office during the present session."
On March 12, the Committee reported that it is necessary to appoint a President pro tempore, and that the President pro tempore chosen at the previous session does not continue in office at the next session. Besides, the committee opined that a President pro tempore can only be appointed if the Lieutenant Governor is actually absent, and that the appointment ceases whenever the Lieutenant Governor returns.
On March 25, Erastus S. Prosser (R) was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate "for this day." Later on the same day, William H. Ferry (R) was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate "for the balance of the Session."
On April 3, the Select Committee's resolution to expel Jay Gibbons was adopted by a vote of 99 to 8.

Cubic pyramid

In 4-dimensional geometry, the cubic pyramid is bounded by one cube on the base and 6 square pyramid cells which meet at the apex. Since a cube has a circumradius divided by edge length less than one, the square pyramids can made with regular faces by computing the appropriate height.
The dual to the cubic pyramid is a octahedral pyramid, seen as an octahedral base, and 8 regular tetrahedral meeting at an apex.
Related polytopes and honeycombs.
A cubic pyramid of height zero can be seen as a cube divided into 6 square pyramids along with the center point. These square pyramid-filled cubes can tessellate three-dimensional space as a dual of the truncated cubic honeycomb, called a "hexakis cubic honeycomb", or pyramidille.

Siege of Acapulco (1813)

The Siege of Acapulco was a battle of the War of Mexican Independence that occurred on 12 April 1813 at Acapulco de Juárez. The battle was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown, commanded by Pedro Antonio Vélez, and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire, commanded by José María Morelos. The battle resulted in a victory for the Mexican rebels.
The Battle.
After a series of skirmishes leading up to the actual siege, Mexican rebel forces were finally able to besiege the city and take the plaza of Acapulco on 12 April 1813. The Spanish forces took refuge in the Fuerte de San Diego where they were able to continue to resist the insurgent attacks until August of the same year when a truce was signed between José María Morelos and José Pedro Antonio Vélez de Zúñiga. The rebel victory was strategically important because the port was one of the largest and most important to the strategic objectives laid out by Morelos at the start of the campaign.
