Teardrops on My Guitar

"Teardrops on My Guitar" is a song by American country pop singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was co-written by Swift, alongside Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift's aid. "Teardrops on My Guitar" was released on February 19, 2007 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's eponymous debut studio album (2006). The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, "Fearless" (2008), and released as the third single from the album in the United Kingdom. It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings. He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by. Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him. Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar. Some critics have queried the song's classification as country music. 
Critics received the track generally positively, complimenting Swift's vocal delivery and songwriting style. The song is considered to be Swift's breakthrough single, as it spread her popularity throughout the United States. "Teardrops on My Guitar" was commercially successful, peaking at number 13 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming the best-charting single from "Taylor Swift" on the chart. The single was also certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy and features Swift as she sees her love interest develop a relationship with another female. The video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, but lost to Tokio Hotel's music video for "Ready, Set, Go!". The song was promoted through multiple live performances, some while supporting as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed "Teardrops on My Guitar" on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour (2009–10).
Background.
Swift was inspired to write "Teardrops on My Guitar" about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick, later went on to join the Navy. During their freshman year of high school at Hendersonville High School, Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in a class everyday. The two developed a fond friendship, although Swift secretively desired for it to become a romantic relationship. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about a girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, "How beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was. And I sat there and listened, never meaning it any of the times I said 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'" Hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of "Taylor Swift", he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or the song and continued his relationship with the same female. Upon "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward to call back. 
Two years after the album's release, as she was leaving her house to attend a Nashville Predators hockey game with Kellie Pickler and Carrie Underwood, Hardwick appeared at her driveway. A car parked and, out of it, exited Hardwick and a friend of his. After two and a half years of not speaking, the two conversed: "He was like, 'Hey, how's it going?' And I'm like, 'Wow, you're late. Good to see you.' But we were civilized." Swift conjectured multiple theories as to why Hardwick appeared at her house. One of them was that he was attempting to prove to his friend that he was indeed the subject of "Teardrops on My Guitar". Other possibilities was that he wanted to amend their friendship or believed Swift was still pining away from him. Swift said it would have been poetic if he approached her upon the album's release and she would have accepted, but that she had already moved on. Swift cited "Teardrops on My Guitar" as an example of how she expresses her sentiments in songs and sometimes in no other manner. She was not afraid of using Hardwick's first name on the track and, therefore, believed it was very honest and susceptible, something she adored.
Composition.
"Teardrops on My Guitar" is a country pop song with a length of three minutes and 35 seconds. It is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute. It is written in the key of B major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from F3 to B4. Swift sings in a breathless manner. It follows the chord progression B–Gm–E–F. The track's instrumentation is gently guided by mandolin and acoustic guitar, with accents of brushed drums. It ultimately resulting in a simple and tender undertone.
The lyrics of "Teardrops on My Guitar" speak of heartbreak and are direct, referring to the subject by his first name, Drew. The song describes fancying someone who already interested in someone else and, therefore, maintaining the sentiments a secret. To him, Swift acted as though she was happy about his relationship, while crying and lamenting at home. Dave Heaton of PopMatters interpreted the lines "And there she goes, so perfectly / The kind of flawless I wish I could be" to address Swift's ideal of perfection and her attempting to meet it, but not succeeding, a predominant theme on "Fearless".
Critical reception.
Regarding the song's musical genre, Roger Holland of PopMatters believed there was no reason for Swift to limit herself into only the country music or why she should be a country artist at all. Holland continued, "Yet this is the channel to market she has chosen, and so she has to be prepared to hear complaints about the way that trademarked Mutt Lange guitar whine has been married to her bright shiny pop songs in order to get them onto CMT, GAC, and country radio." Bill Lamb of About.com rated "Teardrops on My Guitar" four out of five stars. Lamb complimented Swift's vocal delivery and songwriting style, but criticized the production and arrangement, perceiving them to be dull. He added that the track's refrains were most impacting and deemed it among the most memorable songs of 2007. Sean Dooley, also of About.com, described Swift's vocals as "nothing less than captivating." Lucy Davies of the BBC believed "Teardrops on My Guitar" was not impressed by the song's lyrical similarity with other songs on "Taylor Swift" or "Fearless". 
Fiona Chua of MTV Asia said "Teardrops on My Guitar" demonstrated that with Swift, "what you hear is what you get", and selected it as one best cuts on "Fearless". Deborah Evans Price of "Billboard" stated that "Teardrops on My Guitar" showcased the same qualities as "Tim McGraw" (2006) – solid gifts of songwriting and time-halting earnest and pure voice. Price declared that the song made obvious that Swift would have much success for years to come at the time. She believed the track was ultimately relatable and Swift was capable of making the song palpable. Chuck Taylor, also of "Billboard", reviewed the pop version release of "Teardrops on My Guitar", and stated it was a "beautiful mainstream intro to an artist whose rise is ably exemplified by her last name." An uncredited review from "Rolling Stone" attributed the track to be one of the reasons why "Taylor Swift" was so commercially successful. Jon Bream of "Star Tribune" believed the song was in attempt to empower high school- and college-age females by confronting males.

Music video.
The accompanying video to "Teardrops on My Guitar" was directed by Trey Fanjoy, who directed the video for "Tim McGraw". Swift decided to film the video with Fanjoy as a result of how positive the experience was when filming "Tim McGraw". She appreciated all the preparation techniques that she taught her and stated, "You have to remember the people who were good to you in the beginning". Swift said the video centered around unrequited love. Some of Swift's associates first believed the video should have been set in a prior era. They then thought about filming the video at a large city. However, Swift wanted to go back to basics and keep the song's integrity by filming the video in Nashville, Tennessee. American singer and actor Tyler Hilton portrayed Drew. He was cast because of prior interactions with Swift. They had a mutual fondness for each other's music. Taking into account his acting on the television series "One Tree Hill" and the film "Walk the Line" (2005), Swift asked him to participate in the video after he attended and performed at one of her concerts. Swift chose Hilton primarily because he accurately presented Drew Hardwick, the fun, funny, fun-loving, blue-eyed boy whom she was friends with and had a huge crush on during high school. The video was filmed in one day in March 2007 at Hume-Fogg High School; the drama room was transformed to simulate a bedroom for the performance scenes.
The video commences with Drew asking Swift, "Hey, are you gonna go to the game on Friday?" Swift responds, "Well, I was thinking about it. Why?" He then admits it was just curiosity, informs Swift about a girl he met, and walks away. The video then transcends to Swift, wearing a long aquamarine evening gown, lying beside an acoustic guitar on a mattress in a bedroom. She performs the song until the scene transitions to Swift and Drew at the library, where he parodies a novel and she chuckles. The librarian requests for the two to maintain silence, so they converse quietly. Afterwards, Swift is in a chemistry laboratory, where she is mixing substances. Distracted by Drew approaching her, she accidentally pours too much of one substance and causes it to spill. They both rapidly attempt to clean the mess generated. As the song approaches its bridge, Swift and Drew walk towards each other, both smiling, but Drew then kisses his girlfriend, as Swift watches in agony. The video again transcends to the performance scene, where it concludes. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the mattress, crying, and standing beside a fireplace in the bedroom. The video received a nomination for "Number One Streamed Music Video" at the web-hosted 2007 CMT Online Awards, but lost to Sugarland's "Stay" (2007). The video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Tokio Hotel's video for "Ready, Set, Go!" (2007).
Live performances.
She performed "Teardrops on My Guitar" as she opened for Rascal Flatts on several dates, from October 19 to November 3, 2006, included on the Me and My Gang Tour (2006–07). Swift opened the concert with the song and dressed in a black, knee-length dress and red cowboy boots with a design of a scull and cross bones across it, playing an acoustic guitar. She also performed the song when she served as opening act on twenty dates for George Strait's 2007 United States tour, and selected dates for Brad Paisley's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour in 2007. During mid-2007, Swift engaged as the opening act on several dates for Tim McGraw's and Faith Hill's joint tour, Soul2Soul II Tour (2006–07), where she again performed "Teardrops on My Guitar". Swift performed the song while she was again opening for Rascal Flatts for their Still Feels Good Tour in 2008.
When promoting the single, Swift performed it on numerous venues, including "Total Request Live" (TRL),
The Engine Room, on the Studio 330 Sessions, and a concert at the Apple Store in SoHo, New York, which was recorded and released as a live extended play (EP), "iTunes Live from SoHo", exclusively sold through the iTunes Store. In the United Kingdom, the song was performed at an exclusive performance, hosted by 95.8 Capital FM and on "The Paul O'Grady Show". Since completing promotion for "Taylor Swift" and its corresponding singles, Swift has performed "Teardrops on My Guitar" as a duet with English rock band Def Leppard on "CMT Crossroads", the episode was released as a DVD exclusively through Wal-Mart stores in the United States, Clear Channel Communications's Stripped, at the 2009 CMA Music Festival, at the 2009 V Festival, and at the Australian charity concert Sydney Sound Relief. 
Swift performed the song on all venues of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to June 2010. During each performance, she donned a sparkly cocktail dress and black, leather boots. The performance initiated with Swift sitting in a desk, next to a backup dancer who portrayed Swift's love interest, at the upper level of the stage, which a library was projected onto. The backup dancers then stood up to slow dance with a female backup dancer as Swift sang from above. Swift then appeared at the main stage to conclude the performance. Jim Abbot of "The Orlando Sentinel" attended the March 5, 2010 concert at the Amway Arena in Orlando, Florida. He stated, "Taking a cue from her pal Miley Cyrus, Swift embellishes hits such as 'Teardrops On My Guitar' and 'Love Story' with a lot of flashy production in concert." Brandy McDonnell of "The Oklahoman", who attended the March 31, 2010 concert at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City, believed "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s music video heavily influenced the setting and role she enacted in the performance. Swift performed the song for the first time in three years during the Red Tour's stop in San Antonio, Texas on May 22, 2013.

3 Hammers

3 Hammers (sometimes called Three Hammers) is a strong white cider made in Tiverton, Devon, England by the Aston Manor Brewery. Before 2009 it was made by the Devon Cider Company, until that company was taken over by Aston Manor. The cider is named after a small village near Tiverton.
The strength and cheapness of this and similar white ciders has made them subject to calls for higher taxation to reduce the potential for abuse. In 2006 a litre of 3 Hammers could be bought for £1.19, cheaper by volume than a bottle of Perrier water at 99p for 75 cl.

Governmental lists of cults and sects

The application of the labels (cults or sects) to religious movements in government documents usually signifies the popular and negative use of the term "cult" in English and a functionally similar use of words translated as "sect" in several European languages. Government reports which have used these words include those from Austria, Belgium, Canada, France (in 1995), and Germany. While these documents utilize similar terminology they do not necessarily include the same groups nor is their assessment of these groups based on agreed criteria. Included below are lists maintained by governments in which groups are referred to as "cults" or similar. Other governments and world bodies also report on new religious movements but do not use these terms to describe them.
Austria.
Beginning in 2011, the United States Department of State's "International Religious Freedom Report", as released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor no longer distinguishes sects in Austria as a separate group. Rather, religious groups are divided into three legal categories: officially recognized religious societies, religious confessional communities, and associations. In the most recent year for which sects were officially recognized in Austria, the groups included the Church of Scientology, the Unification Church, the Divine Light Mission, Eckankar, Hare Krishna, Osho movement, Sahaja Yoga, Sai Baba, Sri Chinmoy, Transcendental Meditation, Fiat Lux, Universal Life, and The Family.
Belgium.
Parliamentary Inquiry Commission (1997).
The Justice Commission of the Belgian House of Representatives set up a parliamentary inquiry commission to work out a policy concerning cults. On April 28, 1997, the parliamentary commission issued its 670-page report that contained a list of 189 movements, and stated that "fact that a movement is listed here, even if at the instigation of an official instance, does not signify that the Commission regards it as a cult". The parliament failed to adopt the report as such and only voted to accept the conclusions and recommendations (19 pages), and not the list. Despite the lack of adoption of the list, the commission published the whole report, including the list. According to Human Rights Without Frontiers International, a Brussels Appeals Court in 2005 condemned the Belgian House of Representatives on the grounds that it had damaged the image of an organization (the Universal Church of God's Kingdom) listed in the 1997 parliamentary inquiry commission on sects.
The Belgian list of groups (French-language naming or primary naming, with numbering as in the original document):
Canada.
A Canadian Security Intelligence Service report of 1999 discussed "Doomsday Religious Movements espousing hostile beliefs and having the potential to be violent.." Groups classified as "Doomsday Religious Movements" included:
In 2005, the Hate Crimes Unit of the Edmonton Police Service confiscated anti-Falun Gong materials distributed at the annual conference of the American Family Foundation by staff members of the Calgary Chinese Consulate (Province of Alberta, Canada). The materials, including the calling of Falun Gong a "cult," were identified as having breached the Criminal Code, which bans the wilful promotion of hatred against identifiable religious groups.
China.
The General Office of Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China maintains a list of what it considers "evil cults," (邪教) entitled "Information Regarding the Organizations Already Identified as Cults." Among the Christian-based groups listed one of the best known is Zhao Weishan's Eastern Lightning. The followers of Watchman Nee (the Local Churches, or original Shouters) are said to be the first group put on the list, in 1983. Other Christian-based groups on the list include: The splinter groups of Li Changshou's original Difang Jiaohui, known as the Huhanpai (He Enjie's Changshouzhu jiao, Chinese Shouters), include Zhao Weishan's Eastern Lightning (also Actual God, Shijishen, 实际神), Wu Yangming's Beili Wang (Established King), Liu Jiaguo's Lord God Sect, and . Other groups unrelated to the Shouters include Hua Xuehe's Lingling Sect, Xu Yongze's All Scope Church or Born Again Movement (BAM) and its offshoot Gong Shengliang's Huanan jiaohui South China Church, Li Sanbao's Mentuhui or Tudihui (Disciples Church), Xu Wenku's Sanban Puren Pai (Three Ranks of Service), Wu Huanxing's Cold Water Sect (Lengshui jiao), Liang Jiangye's Commune Sect (Fanwugongyongpai), the New Testament Church (China) founded by Hong Kong movie actress Jiang Duanyi then led by Zhang Lude and Zuo Kun as the Taiwan Apostles Faith Church (Shitu Xinxinhui), the Resurrection Way Fuhuodao of Guo Guangxu and Wen Qiuhui, as well as offshoots of Korean Christian new religious movements: The Unification Church of Rev. Moon, Dami Evangelism Association, and the World Elijah Evangelism Association. Buddhist-based proscribed sects include Lu Shengyan's Taiwan-based Lingxian Zhenfozong (灵仙真佛宗, True Buddha School), Ching Hai's Guanyin Famen, and Yuandun Famen. In 2001 Falun Gong was added to the list.
France.
In 1995, a parliamentary commission of the National Assembly of France on cults produced its report (in French: compare an unofficial English translation). The report included a list of purported cults compiled by the general information division of the French National Police ("Renseignements généraux" — a French police service) in association with cult-watching groups.
In May 2005 the then Prime Minister of France, in a "circulaire", which stressed that the government must exercise vigilance concerning the cult phenomenon, said that the list of movements attached to the Parliamentary Report of 1995 had become less pertinent, based on the observation that many small groups had formed: scattered, more mobile, and less-easily identifiable, and that the government needed to balance its concern with cults with respect for public freedoms and laïcité (secularism). Subsequent French parliamentary commissions on cults reported on specific aspects of cult activity in 1999 and in 2006.
French parliamentary commission report (1995).
Opinion in France varies as to the applicability of the 1995 Parliamentary report. A provincial court case noted that all such Parliamentary reports have no juridical impact. And as stated above, a Prime Ministerial "circulaire" warned that name-changes had reduced the usefulness of this particular Parliamentary report.
French parliamentary commission report (1999).
The French Parliamentary report of 1999 on cults and money concentrated its attention on some 30 groups which it judged as major players in respect of their financial influence. It underlined the non-exhaustive character of its investigations, seeing them as a snapshot at a point in time and based on informatiion available.
The groups examined included:
Germany.
Berlin Senate report (1997).
An official report of a Senate Committee of the city and state of Berlin in Germany listed and discussed cults (), emphasizing with its sub-title their categorization as "entities espousing a world view and new religions". The 1997 Berlin Senate report — entitled "Cults: Risks and Side-effects: Information on selected new religious and world-view espousing Movements and Psycho-offerings" — subdivided "selected suppliers" ("ausgewählte Anbieter") of its objects of interest as:
Russia.
In 2008 the Russian Interior Ministry prepared a list of "extremist groups." At the top of the list were Islamic groups outside of "traditional Islam," which is supervised by the Russian government. Next listed were "Pagan cults". In 2009 the Russian Ministry of Justice created a council which it named "Council of Experts Conducting State Religious Studies Expert Analysis." The new council listed 80 large sects which it considered potentially dangerous to Russian society, and mentioned that there were thousands of smaller ones. Large sects listed included: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, and what were called "neo-Pentecostals." 
Controversies.
French list.
The criteria chosen by the French Renseignements généraux to establish the potential dangers of a movement were criticized since they were considered vague and may include many organizations, religious or not. One of the first criticisms came from bishop Jean Vernette, the national secretary of the French episcopate to the study of cults and new religious movements, who stressed that these criteria can be applied to almost all religions. Moreover, sociologists such as Bruno Étienne emphasized that the mental manipulation should not be defined by the policemen of the Renseignements généraux. The list of cults was based on the criteria defined by the Renseignements généraux, but without specifying which of their practices are specifically criticized. In addition, the secrecy of the work made by the RG led to questions about the presence or absence of certain organizations in the list. Étienne questioned the presence of the CEDIPAC SA company, formerly known as European Grouping of Marketing Professionals (GEPM), as its activity is not in the religious field. The absence of Opus Dei or the Freemasons also raised questions. In 2007, Yves Bertrand, General Director of the Renseignements généraux from 1992 to 2003, spoke about his collaborative work with the parliamentary reports on cults, and said: "Alongside genuine and dangerous cults practicing removal of school, abuse of weakness or pedophilia, some groups have been a bit quickly dress up of the word cult". Furthermore, on 27 May 2005, the 1995 list of cults of the French report was officially cancelled and invalidated by Jean-Pierre Raffarin's circulaire.
In France, Antoinism was classified as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary reports which considered it one of the oldest healer groups. However, in a 1984 letter, the French Minister of the Interior wrote that the movement was considered, from an administrative point of view, as having for exclusive purpose the exercise of a religion, thus complying with the 18th and 19th Articles of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. He added that antoinism had always been allowed to receive bequests or donations, which meant that its religious nature was never challenged. In addition, many anti-cults activists, associations or watchers said they had not noticed cultic deviances in this group. For example, when heard by the Belgian commission on cults, philosopher Luc Nefontaine said that "the establishment of a directory of cult movements (...) seems to him dangerous, because it would also give a bad image of quite honourable organizations such as (...) Antoinism". Eric Brasseur, director of Centre for information and advice on harmful cultish organizations (Centre d'information et d'avis sur les organisations sectaires nuisibles, or CIAOSN) said: "This is a Belgian worship for which we have never had a complaint in 12 years, a rare case to report". Similarly, in 2013, the Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances (Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires, or MIVILUDES) made this comment: "We have never received reporting from Antoinists. They heal through prayer, but as long as they do not prevent people from getting proper treatment by legal means..." In addition, the Renseignements généraux stopped monitoring the religion given the absence of any problem. In 2002, the national service "Pastoral, sects and new beliefs" ("Pastorale, sectes et nouvelles croyances"), which analyses new religious movements from a catholic point of view, wrote about Antoinism: "Although listed among the cults in the 1995 Parliamentary Report, it has no cultish feature." Similarly, the French sociologist Régis Dericquebourg, who deeply studied the religion, concluded that Antoinism is not a cult: it "has no totalitarian influence on its members, and do not dictate their behaviour to get in the world; it is not exclusive shows no hostility towards social systems".
In France, the 1995 parliamentary report listed the Shri Ram Chandra Mission. This has been criticized by lawyer Lawrence Hincker, who said that "this system of meditation, called Sahaj Marg, does not lead to a life away from the world. It integrates all aspects of man, whether physical, mental or spiritual, without charge or austerity or penance or self-negation". According to the sociologist Bruno Étienne, an expert on religious issues, the SRCM publishes books as any other group but does not proselytize, and has never been convicted: "To us, it is fully a NMR (new religious movement), modern religious group, although based on an ancient tradition, and subject to serious arguments advanced by others more knowledgeable, we do not understand why it is criticized on the list of the damned". Raphaël Liogier, Director of the Observatory of religious and university professor at the Institut d'Études Politiques in Aix-en-Provence, said he did not understand the inclusion on the cult list of an association that is fully recognized in India.

Metta Sutta

The Mettā Sutta is the name used for two Buddhist discourses (Pali, "sutta") found in the Pali Canon. The one, more often chanted by Theravadin monks, is also referred to as "Karaṇīyamettā Sutta" after the opening word, "Karaṇīyam", "(This is what) should be done." It is found in the Suttanipāta (Sn 1.8) and Khuddakapāṭha (Khp 9). It is ten verses in length and it extols both the virtuous qualities and the meditative development of "mettā" (Pali), traditionally translated as "loving kindness" or "friendliness." 
The other, also chanted by Theravadin Buddhist monks at times, extols the benefits of the practice of "mettā" (Pali) and it is found in the Anguttara Nikaya (AN 11.15). is also referred to as "Mettānisamsa Sutta". This article will focus on the first version.
Background.
In Theravāda Buddhism's Pali Canon, "mettā" is one of the four "divine abodes" (Pali: "brahmavihāra") recommended for cultivating interpersonal harmony and meditative concentration (see, for instance, kammaṭṭhāna). In later canonical works (such as the Cariyāpiṭaka), "mettā" is one of ten "perfections" ("pāramī") that facilitates the attainment of awakening ("Bodhi") and is a prerequisite to attaining Buddhahood. 
According to post-canonical Sutta Nipāta commentary, the background story for the Mettā Sutta is that a group of monks were harassed by tree-dwelling deities in a forest; when the monks seek the Buddha's aid in dealing with the deities, the Buddha teaches the monks the Mettā Sutta for them to recite regularly; the monks do so and, as a result, win over the deities' good will.
Contents.
The Mettā Sutta contains a number of recollections or recitations that promote the development of mettā through virtuous characteristics and meditation.
The discourse identifies fifteen moral qualities and conditions conducive to the development of "mettā". These include such qualities as being non-deceptive ("uju"), sincere ("suju"), easy to correct ("suvaco"), gentle ("mudu") and without arrogance ("anatimānī").
In terms of meditative development, the discourse identifies:
Use.
It is often recited as part of religious services in the Theravāda tradition, but is also popular within the Mahayana tradition. Cultivating mettā through the recitation of the Mettā Sutta is sometimes believed to have apotropaic powers within the Theravāda tradition.
It has been reported that Buddhist monks chanted the Mettā Sutta as part of their demonstration in September and October 2007 against the military in Burma.

Gammarana

Gammarana is a neighborhood in the city of Teramo in Italy's Abruzzo region. It is located near the local railway station. In the 1960s a number of apartment buildings were constructed in the area and in doing its character changed in nature from industrial to residential.
History.
Up until World War II Gammarana hosted a small airport. During the war many small military aircraft used the airport to ferry supplies and war materials in and out of Teramo. One street, Via dell'aeroporto (Airport Road), still bears the name of this transportation link. The airport has long been razed to make way for the residential building boom which followed the Allied victories. 
In the late 1950s and early 1960s several medium industrial enterprises were established in Gammarana. Included among these are Villeroy & Boch (a ceramics company which has since closed in the area and whose partially renovated factory is now a small concert hall), a candy factory (Confettificio Arcangeli, also closed and now a communications center for the Tercas S.p.A. newsgroup), and another candy manufacturer (Aquila d'Oro, whose factory was later transformed into "Campo del re" and today is the headquarters for the television show "Teleponte"). Previously located in the area was the recently demolished "Adone" factory (a small steel producer specializing in the manufacture of railroad tracks). This site awaits future development, so important for jobs and tax revenues to citizens of Teramo. In the year 2007 the old Gavini factory (a bottling company) is due to reopen as the "Città della Scienza" ("City of Science") educational and research center. In future years a physics and astrophysics museum named "Galileium" will be colocated in this building. 
On the outskirts of this neighborhood are two public sports facilities. The area known as Acquaviva boasts several basketball courts, an open field used for soccer and rugby, a roller skating area, calcetto (a European sport similar to soccer but played on a much smaller field with either five or seven players on each side), and indoor and outdoor swimming pools. A second area is called Camposcuola and is noted for its athletic field, tennis and five-a-side football courts. 
In recent years local neighborhood authorities have encouraged local students in the nearby elementary, middle and high schools to construct large public murals on the brick enclosure which surrounds the long shuttered Villeroy & Boch factory as well as posterior wall of the railway station.

Guy Baring

Honourable Guy Victor Baring (26 February 1873 – 15 September 1916) was a British Army officer and politician. He became a Conservative member of the British Parliament but was one of 22 Members killed in action in the First World War.
Background.
Baring was a member of the Baring family of Barings Bank, a younger son of Alexander Baring, 4th Baron Ashburton (1835–1889) and his wife the Hon. Leonora Caroline Digby. He was educated at Eton College and Sandhurst, and joined the Coldstream Guards in 1893.
In 1899 Baring's unit was sent to fight in the South African War, and he was present at the battles of Belmont, Graspan, Modder River, Magersfontein, and Driefontein, as well as the occupation of Bloemfontein. During the fighting in South Africa he was mentioned in despatches, and received the Queen's South Africa Medal with three clasps.
Baring was the commander of a detachment of the Coldstream Guards in 1900 which went with the Australia and New Zealand Imperial Representative Corps to the inauguration of the Earl of Hopetoun as Governor-General of Australia. He was promoted to Captain in March 1901, attached to the King's African Rifles and was a special service officer with the Jubaland Expedition in 1901 against the Ogaden Somalis and was awarded a medal with clasp.
In February 1902 he was appointed Captain of the Coldstream Guards vice John Ponsonby, who was seconded to serve in South Africa.
Career.
He was elected as the Member of Parliament for Winchester in the 1906 general election, and was re-elected in the January and December 1910 elections with increased majorities.
Although he had formally left the Coldstream Guards in 1913, he rejoined immediately on the outbreak of war in 1914. He was posted to Windsor where he commanded a training company, until July 1915 when he was posted to France. He was second-in- command of the 4th (Pioneer) Battalion; after the Battle of Loos he commanded the first Battalion of the Coldstream Guards;
Death.
During the Battle of the Somme on the morning of 15 September 1916, Baring's Battalion were advancing along the Ginchy-Lesboeufs road to attack German positions, together with two others. It was the first time in history that three Coldstream Guard battalions attacked together, but despite advancing "as steadily as though they were walking down the Mall" the action took a heavy toll. 17 officers and 690 other ranks went into battle, but only three officers survived (one injured) and 221 other ranks. Baring was buried in The Citadel New Military Cemetery near Fricourt.
Family.
Baring married on 16 July 1903 Olive Alethea Smith, daughter of Hugh Colin Smith and Constance Maria Josepha Adeane, and they had six children, including the cricketer Giles Baring. Their great grandchildren include the actress Rachel Ward and the actress and environmentalist Tracy Worcester.

Tatsumi Kumashiro

Life and career.
Early life.
Tatsumi Kumashiro was born on April 24, 1927 in Saga, on Kyūshū-- the southernmost of Japan's four main islands. His father was a pharmaceuticals merchant and judo master descended from the "samurai" class. A strict disciplinarian, Kumashiro's father believed in the warrior philosophy of Yamamoto Tsunetomo as written in "Hagakure" and supported Japan's military exploits of the 1930s and 1940s. Early in life Kumashiro rebelled against this upbringing by immersing himself in film and Western literature. During World War II, Kumashiro entered medical school as a means of avoiding the draft, but dropped out as soon as the war ended in Japan's defeat. He studied English literature at Waseda University, but, deciding he could not make a living writing novels, entered Shochiku studio as an assistant director in 1952, and moved to Nikkatsu in 1955.
Kumashiro worked as an assistant director and screenwriter until he was finally given a chance to direct in 1968. His debut film, "Front Row Life", told the story of a stripper and her daughter who wished to join her mother's profession. The star of the movie, Hatsue Tonooka, became Kumashiro's wife later in the year, though the marriage ended in divorce within a few months. "Front Row Life" anticipated Kumashiro's later career in its focus on striptease performers. The film was a critical success, but because it failed at the box-office Nikkatsu put Kumashiro's directing career on hold again.
Directorial success.
"My films are about people not biology."<br>-- Tatsumi Kumashiro
In 1971, facing bankruptcy due to a loss of their audience to television, Nikkatsu decided to devote its facilities almost exclusively to theatrical soft-core pornography. Several directors, not wishing to work in pornography, left the studio, opening up vacant positions. 
Nikkatsu gave its "Roman porno" directors a great deal of artistic freedom in their films, as long as they met the official minimum quota of four nude or sex scenes per hour. In this environment, at the age of 44, Kumashiro was given his second chance to direct. Though his later films took full advantage of Nikkatsu's lenient policies by experimenting with cinematic time and space in an almost surreal manner, his first "Roman porno", "Wet Lips" ("Nureta Kuchibiru") (1972), was fairly simplistic. However, this story of a prostitute and her lover on the run after killing her pimp proved to be a major critical and box-office success, and established Kumashiro's directorial career. "Wet Lips" was also the first of Kumashiro's many films to use the word "Wet" ("nureta") in the title.
His next film, "Ichijo's Wet Lust" (1972) was another hit with the critics and the public. Japan's most famous sex performer of the time, Sayuri Ichijō, played the title role for which she won the important "Kinema Jumpo" prize for best actress. Accepting the best director and best script awards at the same ceremony, Kumashiro commented, "If I can shoot what I like without the pressure of how it will turn out, I am motivated."
Mid career.
For the next 20 years, Kumashiro directed a string of financial and critical hits unprecedented in Japanese cinematic history, completing ten films in 1972 and 1973 alone. His prolific and successful career during these years earned him the title, "King of Nikkatsu "Roman porno"" Contrasting him with more mainstream filmmakers like Nagisa Oshima, who sometimes make use of pornographic elements in their films, "Film Quarterly"’s New York editor, William Johnson calls Kumashiro, "an indisputable maker of screen porn whose films also deserve 'serious' interest." Kumashiro's work was noted for its humanistic themes and for its sympathetic treatment of its characters. Stylistically, his films were experimental, using a variety of "avant-garde" cinematic devices, and complex narrative structure.
"" (1973) was an adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's "Justine" (1791). Jasper Sharp writes that Kumashiro uses de Sade's story as a platform for criticizing morality imposed by power, with particular relevance to the censorship trial Nikkatsu was undergoing at the time with the prosecution of "Love Hunter" (1972). Underlying this theme, common in Kumashiro's work, Kumashiro has one of his characters say, "What you accept as ethical is contrived by those in authority so they can control people." Kumashiro also employs censorship as one of the stylistic devices of the film, exaggerating the fogging required by Japanese law by placing black blocks over large areas of the screen.
"Lovers Are Wet" and "The World of Geisha" (both 1973) were two more films in which Kumashiro similarly used the censor's tools to make an anti-censorship statement. François Truffaut called "The World of Geisha" (1973) a "great movie," adding, "The acting is perfect, and the film is humorous. In its praise for female beauty and derision for male stupidity lies the generous spirit of Jean Renoir." "Street of Joy" aka "Red Light District: Gonna Get Out" (1974), employing the same setting as Mizoguchi's "Street of Shame" (1956), illustrates Kumashiro's common use of devices such as internal animated sequences to situate characters, and "enka" songs to comment on the action.
Kumashiro's 1974 film, "Man and Woman Behind the Fusuma Screen: Enduring Skin" ("Yojo-han Fusuma No Urabari: Shinobi Hada") starred Nikkatsu's reigning "Roman porno" Queen, Junko Miyashita. Movie critic Tadao Sato called the film "a masterful porno film rich in emotion, anarchy, and nihilism." Junko Miyashita won the Hochi News award for best actress of 1979 after starring in Kumashiro's "Woman with Red Hair" ("Akai Kami No Onna") (1979), which the Weissers, in their "Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films" call "one of the very best Nikkatsu pink films." Uncharacteristically for Kumashiro, "Woman with Red Hair" has a straightforward narrative structure, but Jasper Sharp writes that it is still a "difficult" film for viewers who are not familiar with Kumashiro's work. The story, in which a sexually voracious woman comes to live with a construction worker, can be read either as a male fantasy, or as a story of a woman's search for sexual satisfaction. Roughly one-third of the film takes place in the bedroom, with the claustrophobic atmosphere heightened by such exterior sounds as moaning from neighboring drug addicts, and non-stop rain. Sharp writes that it is perhaps best interpreted as "out-and-out fantasy".
Kumashiro also took breaks from the Roman Porno genre to direct mainstream films, beginning with "Bitterness of Youth" (1974), a story of student radicalism with similarities to Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" (1925). Other such films include "Light of Africa" (1975) for Toho and "Jigoku" (1979), a remake of Nobuo Nakagawa's 1960 film "Jigoku", for Toei. For the German-Japanese co-production, "The Woman with the Red Hat" (1982), Kumashiro worked with Pink Film producer-director Kōji Wakamatsu. The production was an unsuccessful attempt on Wakamatsu's part to emulate the success he had had in collaborating with the French in Nagisa Ōshima's "In the Realm of the Senses" (1976). The story, dealing with a Japanese man in Germany and his obsessive sexual relationship with a German woman during Hitler's rise to power, also seemed to echo Ōshima's film. Jasper Sharp notes with surprise that Kumashiro, who had long been an opponent of Japanese censorship, did not take advantage of the more liberal European laws. Instead he followed the Japanese practice of obscuring genital areas with props.
Death.
Throughout his life Kumashiro was a frail and sickly man. In the 1980s, as the rising AV (Adult Video) industry took away most of the audience for the theatrical "Roman pornos", Kumashiro's health began failing. He suffered from a collapsed lung in 1983, but, in spite of his poor health, he continued making films until his death. He directed his last two films, "Like a Rolling Stone" ("Bo no Kanashimi") (1994) and "Immoral: Indecent Relations" (1995) while using an oxygen tank. He died of heart and lung failure on February 24, 1995.
Kumashiro is remembered with affection by those who worked with him, and is considered one of the best directors to have worked in the Roman Porno series. When interviewed for the British television program, "Mondo Macabro", actress Kazuko Shirakawa observed that it may have been Kumashiro's poor physical condition which helped him to portray the fragility of human existence. The Japanese film critic and filmmaker Chiseko Tanaka summarized his career with, "Kumashiro was not a great poet like Mizoguchi, Immamura and Oshima. He was a little poet, but he was unique. He devoted himself to his works as a true artist."

<doc id="9903607" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9903607" title="Insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor">
Insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor

Insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R), also called the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "IGF2R" gene. IGF2R is a multifunctional protein receptor that binds insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) at the cell surface and mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-tagged proteins in the "trans"-Golgi network.
Structure.
The structure of the IGF2R is a type I transmembrane protein (that is, it has a single transmembrane domain with its C-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of lipid membranes) with a large extracellular/lumenal domain and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain consists of a small region homologous to the collagen-binding domain of fibronectin and of fifteen repeats of approximately 147 amino acid residues. Each of these repeats is homologous to the 157-residue extracytoplasmic domain of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Binding to IGF2 is mediated through one of the repeats, while two different repeats are responsible for binding to mannose-6-phosphate. The IGF2R is approximately 300 kDa in size; it appears to exist and function as a dimer.
Function.
IGF2R functions to clear IGF2 from the cell surface to attenuate signalling, and to transport lysosomal acid hydrolase precursors from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome. After binding IGF2 at the cell surface, IGF2Rs accumulate in forming clathrin-coated vesicles and are internalized. In the lumen of the "trans"-Golgi network, the IGF2R binds M6P-tagged cargo. The IGF2Rs (bound to their cargo) are recognized by the GGA family of clathrin adaptor proteins and accumulate in forming clathrin-coated vesicles. IGF2Rs from both the cell surface and the Golgi are trafficked to the early endosome where, in the relatively low pH environment of the endosome, the IGF2Rs release their cargo. The IGF2Rs are recycled back to the Golgi by the retromer complex, again by way of interaction with GGAs and vesicles. The cargo proteins are then trafficked to the lysosome via the late endosome independently of the IGF2Rs.
Interactions.
Insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor has been shown to interact with M6PRBP1.
Evolution.
The insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor function evolved from the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and is first seen in Monotremes. The IGF-2 binding site was likely acquired fortuitously with the generation of an exonic splice site enhancer cluster in exon 34, presumably necessitated by several kilobases of repeat element insertions in the preceding intron. A six-fold affinity maturation then followed during therian evolution, coincident with the onset of imprinting and consistent with the theory of parental conflict.

C. W. Parker Carousel

The C. W. Parker Carousel is a carousel built in 1912 currently operating in the Burnaby Village Museum at Deer Lake Park in Burnaby, British Columbia. The carousel was built by the C. W. Parker Company and is also known as the Parker #119 and the Burnaby Centennial Parker Carousel. The carousel was the 119th such machine built by the C. W. Parker Company, earning it its "Parker #119" nickname. The carousel contains 41 horses and operates at a pavilion known as the Don Wrigley Pavilion located at one of the museum's two entrances, earning the entrance the name "Carousel Entrance".
History.
The carousel was built in 1912 at Leavenworth, Kansas by Charles Wallace Parker who owned the C. W. Parker Company, and was the 119th one made by them. It was sold in 1913 for $5,886.00. The carousel toured Texas for two years with the Lone Star Circus. In 1915 the machine was shipped back to the factory.
It is believed that the machine was rebuilt by the factory. Some fancier horses and heavier rounding boards may have been added. Some of the horses were built in 1917 and some in 1920-1922. The history of the carousel from 1915-1936 is unknown. The carousel was purchased by Happyland, an amusement park in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1936.
The carousel remained at Happyland until the amusement park was demolished in 1957. It was moved to the new small pavilion in Playland, (another amusement park in Vancouver) until that too was demolished in 1972.
From 1972 to 1989, Parker #119 was operated outdoors, and was put away each winter.
In 1989 it was announced that the carousel would be sold off horse by horse at an auction in New York. Local residents came together to save the carousel and formed the "Friends of the Vancouver Carousel Society". It was at this time that the carousel was nicknamed the Parker #119.
In May 1989, the Burnaby Village Museum agreed to provide a home for the carousel and the "Friends", led by President Don Wrigley, set about raising the $350,000 to purchase the machine. Keith Jamieson, a carousel expert, was brought in to coordinate the rebuilding project. In 1990, the carousel was purchased. Funds were also raised to pay for the restoration. People who donated money could sponsor a horse and later name it. The museum agreed to build a new pavilion to house the carousel. The pavilion, named the Don Wrigley Pavilion was completed in 1993. The carousel was then named the Burnaby Centennial Parker Carousel.
Carousel horses.
The carousel's horses are listed here:
Notes:
Carousel horse notes.
This section notes horses that are not actually on the carousel and horses that are not really horses.
Some of the carousel's horses are not actually horses, but are listed as such for the purpose of creating a list on the carousel's horses. Examples of this are Horse #38, "Gold Heart Chariot" and Horse #40, "Wurlitzer Band Organ".
Horse #37, known as "Old Paint", was sponsored by the Burnaby Village Museum and was not restored, as a reminder to visitors of the sorry state the carousel was in when the museum first acquired it. The horse was named for the "old paint" that was originally on the carousel before it was restored. The horse is currently in a display case next to the carousel.
Horse #39 is really four small ponies and a wheelchair. This was placed to make the carousel accessible to toddlers and disabled people.
Horse #41 is really two small ponies. While originally on the carousel with Horse #39, they were removed to make room for Horse #39's wheelchair and placed, one each, at the museum's two entrances.
There were originally two chariots on the carousel. One has since gone missing while the carousel was under the ownership of a theme park. The ponies which now form Horses #39 and #41 were added to the area where the other chariot was originally placed. Horse #38 was also cut in half, removing the backdrop and adding more seats to the carousel (a plan to generate more income from the carousel by allowing more people to ride it, done by one of the carousel's theme park owners). When the carousel was bought by the museum, Horse #38 underwent restoration, adding a backdrop to it, making it a chariot once again.

Denis Collins (journalist)

Denis Collins, an American journalist who has written for the "Washington Post", the "San Jose Mercury News", and the "Miami Herald", served as juror #9 in the trial of I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Jr., relating to the Plame affair, and was the first juror to comment publicly about the trial.
He is a former reporter for the "Washington Post" and the author of two recent books: "Spying: The Secret History of History"; and "Nora's Army", about "a Bonus camp in 1932."
He is a resident of Washington, D.C..
He is currently married with two children, Dylan and Riley Collins.
Comment on the guilty verdict in the Libby trial.
On March 6, 2007, the day of the guilty verdict, Collins was the first juror to give media interviews about his experience as a juror in the trial. In his first extended television interview, on "Larry King Live", he told Larry King that he planned to write about the trial.
Subsequently, on March 7, 2007, he posted a seven-page "exclusive" article about his experience as "Juror #9" in "The Huffington Post".
As reported in "CNN Newsroom", and subsequently on "Larry King Live", and by various other television networks, including MSNBC (on "Scarborough Country"), and as he elaborates later in his "HuffPo" article, Collins "said he and fellow jurors found that passing judgment on Libby was 'unpleasant.' But in the final analysis, he said jurors found Libby's story just too hard to believe... 'We're not saying we didn't think Mr. Libby was guilty of the things we found him guilty of, but it seemed like ... he was the fall guy'... Collins said the jury believed Libby was 'tasked by the vice president to go and talk to reporters.'"
A couple of days later, on March 9, 2007, in his article entitled "My Fifteen Minutes, All Because of Scooter", published in "The Washington Post", he elaborates further about his experience as a juror in the Libby trial, reporting that, in the "green room" for "Larry King Live", when he had a conversation with Matthew Cooper, who asked him why the jury acquitted Libby on count three (second charge of making false statements to federal investigators involving Cooper's testimony), Collins did not reveal that he himself "was the primary voice defending Libby on that charge." He also reviews his own sudden media notoriety, explaining:
I spoke to the media because no one else on the jury would. Reporters wanted to know why. I couldn't answer for all the jurors. A few said they were just too overwhelmed...
Later on, concerning media criticism of his speaking about the trial to the media, he adds:
I would speak no more forever. Just as soon as I finished the MSNBC "Countdown" appearance. As I walked into that studio, I was delighted to see my fellow juror Ann Redington on "Hard Ball With Chris Matthews". I felt as though I'd received my own pardon.

Jack Sonni

Jack Sonni (born December 9, 1954, Indiana, Pennsylvania, United States) is a writer, musician and former marketing executive best known as "the other guitarist" in Dire Straits during the band's "Brothers in Arms" era.
Early life and education.
Drawn to music at an early age, Sonni first learned piano, then trumpet, switching to guitar at 14. His love of the instrument lead him to leaving the University of Connecticut where he was studying literature to attend the Hartford Conservatory of Music.
Career.
After graduating, Jack was introduced to New York session guitarist, Elliott Randall - famous for his solo on the hit "Reelin' In the Years" by keyboardist Michael Holmes - graduate of Eastman & bandmate of Tony Levin & Steve Gadd. Randall became a mentor & teacher and convinced Sonni to move to NYC and begin his career. Jack lived in NYC from 1976 thru 1985 initially trying to break into session work but began focusing on his own band. In the late 1970s Sonni's band The Leisure Class had become a Monday night fixture at Kenny's Castaways on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, the place for up and coming acts. In 1978 he started working at the newly opened Rudy's Music Stop, owned by luthier Rudy Pensa, where he met members of Dire Straits, first David and then Mark Knopfler.
He visited the Knopflers in London, and after David (and then Hal Lindes) left the band, Sonni was asked to join the band for the 1984 recording sessions for "Brothers in Arms" and the subsequent tour. Jack accepted, and played guitar synthesizer on "The Man's Too Strong."
After his collaboration with Dire Straits, Sonni contributed to other musicians' works but ended his professional musical career when his twin daughters, Caitlin & Nadine, were born in 1988. He began a second career as a marketing executive, first at Seymour Duncan, then Rivera Guitar Amplifiers followed by several years as director of marketing communications at Line 6, a manufacturer of digital technology products for musicians. In 2001 he moved on to become vice president of marketing communication for Guitar Center, primarily overseeing the company's advertising, promotions and public relations, a position he left in 2006.
In the summer of 2006, Sonni left Guitar Center to return to a creative life as his first love, writing and begin work on a memoir project. He moved to San Jose del Cabo in 2007, spending his mornings surfing and afternoons writing. After nine months in Baja, he moved to northern California, living in Healdsburg, CA until January of 2012 when he relocated to Brooklyn for a short time. 
Sonni spends his time now traveling, writing and working on several new web-based projects. He has also returned to playing music on a regular basis with his band, Los Perros de Amor focusing on, according to Sonni in a recent interview, "having fun playing the music I love with good friends who happen to be great musicians."

Piasecki VZ-8 Airgeep

The Piasecki VZ-8 Airgeep (company designation PA-59) was a prototype vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft developed by Piasecki Helicopter. The Airgeep was developed to fulfill a US Army Transportation Research Command contract for a flying jeep in 1957. The flying jeep was envisioned to be smaller and easier to fly than a helicopter.
Design and development.
To meet the US Army's requirement, Piasecki's design featured two tandem, three-blade ducted rotors, with the crew of two seated between the two rotors. Power was by two Lycoming O-360-A2A piston engines, driving the rotors by a central gearbox. The first of two aircraft ordered by the Army, initially designated the Model 59K Skycar (and later renamed Airgeep) by Piasecki, and designated VZ-8P by the Army flew on 22 September 1958.
It was re-engined with a single Turboméca Artouste IIB turboshaft replacing the two piston engines, flying in this form in June 1959. After being loaned to the US Navy for evaluation as the Model 59N where it was fitted with floats, it was returned to the Army and its engine replaced by a lighter and more powerful Garrett AiResearch TPE331-6 engine. 
The second prototype was completed to a modified design, designated Model 59H AirGeep II by Piasecki and VZ-8P (B) It was powered by two Artouste engines, with ejection seats for the pilot and co-pilot/gunner and a further three seats for passengers. It was also fitted with a powered tricycle undercarriage to increase mobility on land. 
The AirGeep IIs first flight occurred on 15 February 1962 piloted by "Tommy" Atkins.
While the Airgeep would normally operate close to the ground, it was capable of flying to several thousand feet, proving to be stable in flight. Flying low allowed it to evade detection by radar. Despite these qualities, and its superiority over the other two types evaluated by the US Army to meet the same requirement (the Chrysler VZ-6 and the Curtiss-Wright VZ-7), the Army decided that the "Flying Jeep concept unsuitable for the modern battlefield", and concentrated on the development of conventional helicopters.

<doc id="9904062" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9904062" title="Mickey Mouse and Friends (comic book)">
Mickey Mouse and Friends (comic book)

Mickey Mouse (titled Mickey Mouse and Friends from issues #257-303) is a comic book series that has a long-running history, first appearing in 1941 as part of the Four Color one-shot series. It received its own numbering system with issue #28 (1953), and was most recently published by Boom! Studios under its Boom! Kids imprint.
The book emphasizes stories with Mickey and his supporting cast: Goofy, Donald Duck, Minnie Mouse, Pluto and Mickey's nephews Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse. Mickey's perpetual rival is the criminal Peg-Leg Pete (sometimes "Black Pete", "Sneaky Pete" or "Big Bad Pete"). Other adversaries have included Emil Eagle, Eli Squinch, Sylvester Shyster, the team of Dangerous Dan McBoo and Idjit the Midget, and the Phantom Blot. Two major artistic influences on the appearance of Mickey in comics are Floyd Gottfredson, who drew the Mickey Mouse daily newspaper strip from 1930 to 1975, and comic book artist Paul Murry, who drew Mickey stories from 1950 to 1984.
Early development.
In the mid 1930s original Mickey comic book stories were being produced in Italy and the United Kingdom for local consumption. Publishing Mickey comic book stories in the United States was pioneered by the third "Mickey Mouse Magazine" series (1935–1940). Initially published by Hal Horne, it had artwork by John Stanley and text pieces by Irving Brecher. By mid-1936, Horne turned over the magazine to Kay Kamen who oversaw merchandising for Disney. Kamen the following year recruited Western Publishing to handle production and publication. Western added reprinted Disney comic strips to the book's lineup beginning with the July 1937 issue; these included Gottfredson's Mickey daily strips re-formatted and colored for serialized magazine publication. In the words of historian Michael Barrier "Reprinted newspaper comics were never more than a minor part of its lineup until the very last issue, dated September 1940, when they suddenly took up half the pages." But Barrier has also judged the strip reprints "stood out by virtue of their crisp professionalism". The successor title, "Walt Disney's Comics and Stories" (WDC&S), described by Barrier as a true comic book, began publication with the Oct. 1940 issue and had the Gottfredson serials as a prominent feature.
In the 1940s, Mickey's adventures appeared in a series of "Four Color" Dell Comics one-shots with the name "Mickey Mouse" prominently displayed on the cover. In 1953, these one-shots evolved into a regular series titled "Mickey Mouse", starting with issue #28 and lasting through 1990.
Although other magazines called "Mickey Mouse" were available in many countries, they often were less like the American title and more resembled WDC&S, acting as the flagship Disney title for its circulation area and thus containing stories of all the major Disney characters as a function of its anthology format.
Classic era.
The American "Mickey Mouse" title experienced changes in artists, publishers, length, cost, and printing quality over the years. A unique experiment deviating from the norm occurred in 1966: Inspired by the James Bond spy mania of the period for three issues (#107-109) the comic was titled "Mickey Mouse, Super Secret Agent" with stories of Mickey and Goofy becoming international spies and interacting with human characters in realistic settings. While Mickey and Goofy were drawn in the usual "cartoony" style by Paul Murry, the other characters and backgrounds were done by Dan Spiegle in a realistic manner. Comic book historian Michael Barrier dubbed it an aesthetic failure in a contemporary review.
By the 1970s, contents of the "Mickey Mouse" title mostly consisted of the reprinting of earlier stories, sometimes from "Walt Disney's Comics and Stories" or other Disney publications. The average paid circulation between September 1969 and September 1970, when the comic was published six times a year, and cost 15 cents, was 223,396, whereas in 1960 the figure stood at 568,803.
Modern era.
Gladstone.
Gladstone Publishing assumed publication of "Mickey Mouse" in 1986, still publishing reprints, but which were recolored, taking advantage of more modern inking and printing techniques. Stories from foreign Walt Disney comic books were also translated and included. Issues contained a description of the source of each story, and gave credit to the writers and artists by name — which had not previously been done. Letters to the editor often provided additional story background.
Although the circulation of "Mickey Mouse" had declined for years, especially compared to "Uncle Scrooge", in 1987 Gladstone said it had become their top selling title. Even so, in late 1987 Gladstone announced they were cutting all their publications back to eight issues per year (because comics sell less well in fall and winter). The cover price went from 75 cents to 95 cents in 1987 (roughly $1.25 to $1.60 in 2007 dollars). Gladstone published many of Gottfredson's Mickey stories that had never been reprinted since the 1930s or 1940s. "Mickey Mouse" ceased publication in 1990, with issue #256, when Gladstone lost their license to publish the Disney characters.
Publication hiatus.
From 1990 to 2003, no "Mickey Mouse" comic book was published in the United States. However, from 1990 to 1991, a new comic book, "Mickey Mouse Adventures", was published by Disney's then-new comic book imprint, Disney Comics. Disney Comics ceased all publications in 1993.
Additionally, the two part "Perils of Mickey" adventure, "Return to Blaggard Castle/Shadows of the Past", by writer David Cody Weiss and artist Stephen DeStefano, was published in two consecutive 1993 issues of Disney Adventures magazine. This story was a direct sequel to the 1930s Floyd Gottfredson story, "Blaggard Castle," and featured a return to the classic Mickey Mouse art style. The story has been reprinted in "Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse: "Trapped on Treasure Island"" (1932-33 dailies; 2011) ISBN 978-1-60699-495-5.
Gemstone.
In 2003 Gemstone Publishing was granted the license for Disney's comic book characters. They relaunched "Mickey Mouse" under an expanded title, "Mickey Mouse and Friends", continuing the original numbering from #257. The printing of "Mickey Mouse and Friends" was high quality, and the cost was $2.95. Similar to Gladstone's practice, most advertising in the issues was for Gemstone's own products.
Gemstone also took over publication of "Mickey Mouse Adventures" magazine, converting it to a digest, and announcing that it was the first "Disney controlled" comic publication in Disney comics' 55 year history that had not been not licensed to other publishers such as Dell, Gold Key and Gladstone. 
In 2006, Gemstone ceased publication of both "Mickey Mouse Adventures" and "Mickey Mouse and Friends" (along with several non-Mickey titles), leaving "WDC&S" as the only outlet for Mickey Mouse comic book stories in the United States until 2009.
Boom! Kids.
In 2009, Boom! Studios assumed the license for Disney's stable of comic book characters and resumed publication of both "Mickey Mouse and Friends" and "WDC&S" under their "Boom! Kids" imprint, continuing the original issue numbering. Boom! Studios' "Mickey Mouse and Friends" contains full-issue, multi-part modern stories originally created in Europe and translated to English.
Boom! Studios began serializing the multi-part Italian "Wizards of Mickey" epic from "MM" #296-299. It then spun off into its own title. (To date, there have been many "Wizards of Mickey" sagas produced and published in Italy, most yet unpublished in the USA.)
As with Boom! Studios' other Disney-related titles, two versions of each issue of "Mickey Mouse and Friends" were released in early months; one with "Cover A," the other with "Cover B." Aside from the two different covers, the two versions of each issue were identical and had the same contents.
The first Boom! Studios issue of "Mickey Mouse and Friends" was issue #296, released in September 2009. According to a Boom! Studios press release, the issue sold out immediately upon release. Boom! put the series on hiatus with #299 for several months, with the big #300 anniversary issue to be published September 2010.
From issue #300 to the present, the series has reverted to featuring a mixture of new and vintage Mickey stories set in Mickey's everyday life. Issue #304 was the last issue to feature two variant covers; from #305 on, each issue has only been printed with a single cover design.
The original title "Mickey Mouse" replaced "Mickey Mouse and Friends" with issue #304, and has remained just "Mickey Mouse" since that time.
In 2011, the Boom! Studios titles changed to Kaboom! However, by October of that year all Disney comics, including Mickey Mouse, ceased publication. The final Mickey Mouse single issue was #309.

Former graduation calculation rate:
High school.
In 2010, the high school ranked 34th out of 123 western Pennsylvania high schools for student academic achievement on the PSSAs for: reading, writing, math and two years of science by the "Pittsburgh Business Times". In 2009 the high school ranked 41st of western Pennsylvania 11th grades.
In 2011 and 2010, the school achieved Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) status.
According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 28% of California Area School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.
Dual enrollment.
The high school offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $5,101 for the program.
Graduation requirements.
The California Area School Board has determined that a student must earn 26 credits in order to graduate, including: English 4 credits, Math 3 credits, Science 3 credits, Social Science 3 credits, Wellness /First Aid (Health) 0.5 credits, Family & Consumer Science 0.5 credits, Physical Education 1.5 credits, Electives 10.5 credits.
By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district.
By Pennsylvania State School Board regulations, beginning with the graduating class in 2016, students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, English Composition, and Literature for which the Keystone Exams serve as the final course exams. Students’ Keystone Exam scores shall count for at least one-third of the final course grade.

Special education.
In December 2009, the district administration reported that 149 pupils or 15% of the district's pupils received Special Education services.
The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Special Education Department.
In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding.
California Area School District received a $608,708 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.
Gifted education.
The District Administration reported that 19 or 2.03% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student’s building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.
Bullying policy and school safety.
The California Area School District administration reported there were no incidents of bullying, in the district, in 2009-2010.
The California Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives.
Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.
Budget.
In 2009, the district reports employing over 80 teachers with a starting salary of $$35,475 for 180 days for pupil instruction and 186 days total. The average teacher salary was $52,148 while the maximum salary is $111,885. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.

In January 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. Findings were reported to the administration and school board.
The district is funded by a combination of: a local income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the income level.
State basic education funding.
In 2011–12, the district will receive $5,607,648 in state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the district will receive $69,287 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget includes $5,354,629,000 for the 2011–2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010–2011. In 2010 the district reported that 331 pupils received a free or reduced-price lunch due to the family meeting the federal poverty levels.
For 2010-11 the California Area School District received a 3.38% increase in state Basic Education Funding resulting in a $5,912,968 payment. Charleroi School District received a 9.90% increase, which was the highest increase in BEF in Washington County. Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County received the highest increase in the state at 23.65% increase in funding for the 2010-11 school year. One hundred fifty school districts received the base 2% increase in 2010-11. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year.
In the 2009-2010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $5,719,802. The state Basic Education funding to the California Area School District in 2008-09 was $5,607,648.41.

In 2008, the district reported that 386 pupils were receiving a free or reduced cost lunch due to family income meeting federal poverty guidelines.
For the 2009-10 school year, CASD total state funding was 59.98% of the district's revenue, while federal funding amounted to 10.14% of revenues. Local taxes provided 29.88% of revenues.
Accountability Block Grants.
Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania’s school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math teacher coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11 the district applied for and received $188,062 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The California Area School District uses the funding to provide extensive teacher training, reduced class size in K-3rd, to improve instruction based on research and other uses.
Classrooms for the Future grant.
The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. California Area School District was denied funding in 2006-07. In 2007-08 the district received $108,865. In 2008-09, the district received 45,413 for a total funding of $154,278. All but 50 school district participated in the program.
Education Assistance grant.
The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11, California Area School District applied for and received $21,696 in funding.
Federal Stimulus funding.
The district received an extra $1,454,096 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 school years.
Race to the Top grant.
School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.
Common Cents state initiative.
The California Area School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes.
Real estate taxes.
California Area School District School Board set property tax rates in 2011 at 91.0700 mills. School year 2010-11 was the 12th year in a row that the California Area School Board had not raised taxes. Board member George Safin credited a generous state subsidy funding. The district also receives 10 mills payment in lieu of taxes paid by California University of Pennsylvania for dormitory property in the district. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.
Act 1 Adjusted index.
The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index and the adjusted index for each district are publicly announced by the Pennsylvania Department of Education In September each year. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.
The School District Adjusted Index for the California Area School District 2006-2007 through 2010-2011.
For the 2011-12 school year the California Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the school board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.
According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district’s index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.
The California Area School Board also did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index for the budget year 2010-2011, nor for 2009-10. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.
Property tax relief.
In 2010, property tax relief for 2,428 approved residents of California Area School District was set at $179 for 2,271 approved homesteads. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the California Area School District was $179 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 1,311 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Washington County, the highest tax relief went to Washington School District at $407 in 2009 and $414 in 2010. The greatest tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the Chester Upland School District of Delaware County set at $632 in 2009 and $641 in 2010. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Washington County, 73% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.
Enrollment and Consolidation.
The enrollment at California Area School District is among the lowest 8% in Pennsylvania. Department of Education enrollment projections do not anticipate a growth in enrollment for the next decade. A Standard and Poors study found that an optimal school district size, to conserve administrative costs, was 3000 pupils. Consolidation of administrations with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in both communities. According to a 2009 proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improving high school student academic achievement, enriching the curriculum programs or to reducing local property taxes.
More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater). Pennsylvania Department of Education data shows that from 1999-2000 to 2008-09 there has been a 12 percent increase in public school staff even as there was a 1 percent decline in enrollment. Pennsylvania schools added 17,345 professional employees and 15,582 support workers over this time, while enrollment declined by 26,960. Total public school enrollment in 2009 was 1,787,351 pupils. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants released a report finding that the state would save hundreds of million by cutting the number of school administrations in half through consolidation, with no impact on programs offered to students.
Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.
Extracurriculars.
The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. California competes in single A WPIAL sports which include baseball, basketball, football, soccer, tennis and volleyball. The school board sets policies regarding eligibility to participate in these activities.
By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.
As a part of constraints imposed by the 2011-2012 budget, the board eliminated nine assistant coaching positions and afterschool weightlifting and fitness programs. The high school boys' tennis program was eliminated because only one student was on the team. The program costs about $7,000 a year.

Nangong Kuo (Chinese: 南宮适; Pinyin: Nángōng Kuò) was an official of Zhou. According to "Classic of History", he was one of the key ministers of King Wen of Zhou.
Plot in "Fengshen Yanyi".
Nangong Kuo was also a character featured within the classic Chinese novel "Fengshen Yanyi". In this novel, Nangong Kuo is a renowned general that had loyally served under Ji Chang (now better known as King Wen) of Mount Singing Phoenix. Nangong generally seems to be more of an aggressive individual, and will rush to rather impulsive conclusions at times. Following the death of Ji Chang's first son, Boyi Kao, Nangong would swear eternal revenge against King Zhou. Due to Nangong's continuous lust to attack Zhaoge at any possible moment, San Yisheng would develop a negative liking towards him. 
Following King Wen's attack upon Tiger Town, the capital of Chong Houhu, Nangong would be the first to charge the gates of the capital. Once General Huang Yuanji stood before him, Nangong would loudly exert the words, ""Huang Yuanji, you small potato, get out of my way! I only want to fight the real Chong Houhu himself!"" With these words, Nangong, with his great knife, would cut Huang Yuanji down with relative ease. Later on following General Zhang Guifang's attack upon Phoenix City during the Huang Feihu retrieval arc, Nangong would duel it out against Vanguard Feng Lin. After defeating Feng with great ease, he would be captured by his magic technique; only later due to Nezha's assistance would he be saved.

Pablo Ledesma

Pablo Martín Ledesma (born on February 4, 1984 in La Falda, Córdoba) is an Argentine professional footballer, currently playing for Boca Juniors. Well balanced player who is able to play on the right side and central midfield and is known for his speed and passing.
Club career.
Talleres de Córdoba.
During the summer of 2001, Ledesma officially transferred to Talleres de Córdoba and began in the youth team. In his lone season with the Córdoba based club, Ledesma did manage 2 first team appearances. After several impressive performances, the former River Plate player, was scouted by Boca Juniors, but before moving to Boca's youth divisions he played for "Fútbol Juvenil FC".
Boca Juniors.
In the summer of 2003, Ledesma officially transferred to Boca Juniors at the age of 19. His debut for Boca was on July 12, 2003 when Boca lost 2–1 to Colón de Santa Fe. In the Copa Libertadores 2007 Ledesma was a driving force down the right side of midfield for the eventual Champions. Ledesma also scored a clever close-range flick against Colombia's Cúcuta in the Semi Final 1st leg and a brave header at the end of the 1st Leg of the Final against Gremio. After 5 impressive seasons with the Argentine giants, that included well over 100 appearances and 15 total goal, he was monitored by several European clubs, and soon transferred to the Italian Serie A, with Sicilian giants Calcio Catania.
Calcio Catania.
He was officially signed by Catania during the 2008/2009 summer transfer window. He was one of 12 players signed by the Sicilian club during that window, listing Catania as one of the league's most active clubs in the transfer market, along with Sicilian rivals U.S. Città di Palermo. In his first season with the club, Ledesma was regularly a part of the club's first team under, then coach, Walter Zenga, making 24 league appearances, scoring 2 goals in the process. In his second season with the club, the 26 year old Ledesma, was hampered by injuries, and found playing time harder to come by under Siniša Mihajlović, as he was not fully fit for the majority of the season. Ledesma made just 16 appearances in the duration of the 2009–10 Serie A season, but helped to guide Catania to a 13th place league finish, also reaching a record points total for the club. He has since re-established himself back into Catania's starting line-up and made 30 appearances during the 2010-11 campaign, bringing his total appearances for the club up to 74, helping the club to a 13th place finish in the league and a record points total in Serie A for a third consecutive season.
Boca Juniors.
In the winter in Europe of 2012, Pablo Ledesma abandoned Calcio Catania to return to Argentina after three years and played in Boca Juniors. By Twitter one of his partner insult him when he leave Calcio Catania, and saying that the club was very supportive when he left Boca Juniors. Back in Argentina he played for the first time in a friendly match with River Plate on the Derby of Argentina. Boca won 2-0 with two goals of Nicolas Blandi and Ledesma played a great match. 
International career.
He made his debut with the Argentina national football team against Chile, 18 April 2007.

Ralph Wiggum (song)

"Ralph Wiggum" is the seventh track of The Bloodhound Gang's 2005 album "Hefty Fine". It is composed almost entirely of quotes from the character Ralph Wiggum from the animated show "The Simpsons", except for the chorus "Ralphie, get off the stage sweetheart" which is spoken by Ralph's father Chief Wiggum in the episode "Homer's Enemy", and the bridge "Yvan eht nioj", which was a subliminal message ("join the navy" backwards) placed in a song by the short-lived band that Bart, Milhouse, Nelson and Ralph were involved in the episode "New Kids on the Blecch". Acknowledging the fact that it is found poetry, the song is credited to many "Simpsons" writers.
While most reviewers slated "Hefty Fine" as a whole, "Ralph Wiggum" has been singled out as a positive highlight of the album.

Vishnudharmottara Purana

The Vishnudharmottara Purana (or the "Vishnudharmottara") is a Hindu text, encyclopedic in nature. Along with the narratives, it also deals with cosmology, cosmogony, geography, astronomy, astrology, division of time, pacification of unfavourbale planets and stars, genealogies (mostly of kings and sages), manners and customs, penances, duties of Vaishnavas, law and politics, war strategies, treatment of diseases of human beings and animals, cuisine, grammar, metrics, lexicography, metrics, rhetoric, dramaturgy, dance, vocal and instrumental music and arts. It is considered as a supplement or appendix to the Vishnu Purana. It is included in the list of eighteen Upapuranas given in the Brihaddharma Purana (i.25.23-26).
Contents.
The extant text is divided into three "khanda"s (parts). The first "khanda" comprises 269 "adhyaya"s (chapters), the second "khanda" comprises 183 "adhyaya"s and the third "khanda" comprises 118 "adhyaya"s. 
The third "Khanda".
Chapter I of the third "khanda" deals with the origin of image making and the interdependence of arts. Chapters 2-17 deal with grammar, lexicography, metrics and rhetoric. Chapters 18-19 deal with vocal and instrumental music. Chapters 20-34 deal with dance and dramturgy. Chapters 35-43 give an account of the various branches, methods and ideals of Indian painting. It deals not only with its religious aspect but also, and to a far greater extent, with its secular employment. It "proclaims the joy that colours and forms and the representation of things seen and imagined produce". Chapters 44-85 deal with "Pratimalakshana" (iconography). Chapters 86-93 deal with temple construction. Chapters 94-108 deal with "avahana" (induction of deities into images). Chapters 109-118 deal with rites and rituals. 
Stella Kramrisch says that while the Vishnu Purana cannot be earlier than the 2nd half of the 4th century CE, the chapters of the Vishnudharmottara that deal with painting must have been compiled in the 7th century CE.

Glenmore Homestead

The Glenmore Homestead and associated buildings once belonged to pastoral run on the Fitzroy River seven kilometres northwest of Rockhampton, Queensland. It is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register and is operated as a tourist attraction. Originally much larger at 127 square miles the current size of the property is 20 acres.
The grazing property was originally settled in 1858 by John McCartney. In 1864, it was bought by Samuel Birkbeck and his Mexican-born wife, Damiana. The Birkbecks had eight sons and one daughter, Elena. Samuel Birkbeck died in 1867 and the property remains in the hands of his descendants. George Louis Birkbeck currently owns and operates the Homestead as a function venue and tourist attraction. The balance of the land that remains as a portion of the original property is owned by Arthur James Birkbeck (eldest son of Tolstoy Carlos Birkbeck) and managed by Mark Jason Birkbeck, his second son.
Sheep were raised on the property but due to a poor climate for that purpose the Birbecks turned to cattle. They imported 1,500 from Texas. Until the 1980s, the Birkbeck family lived in the original homestead. In the early 1980s, the family opened the house to the public. A souvenir shop was built in 1985. Other late-19th century and early 20th century farm buildings are also on site.
Heritage buildings.
The buildings at Glenmore Homestead are interesting, as they show several types of early dwelling in the Central Queensland area. They consist of a log cabin which was built in 1859 by McCartney, a slab cottage which built in 1858 as a hotel in nearby Parkhurst and moved to the site by Samuel Birkbeck in 1861 as well as a brick cottage which was built by a Mexican employee of the Birkbeck family in 1862. This was originally to be part of a larger hacienda-style homestead, which was never completed. The slab homestead was built on a short-lived gold field called Canoona.
Heritage listing.
Glenmore Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992.

<doc id="9904516" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9904516" title="Tin can wall">
Tin can wall

A tin can wall is a wall constructed from tin cans, which are not a common building source. The cans can be laid in concrete, stacked vertically on top of each other, and crushed or cut and flattened to be used as shingles. They can also be used for furniture. 
Tin cans can form the actual fill-in structure (or walls) of a building, as is done with earthships.
Tin cans have not been around for a long time, and neither have their building methods. The two main structural methods for building with tin cans are by laying them horizontally in a concrete matrix and by stacking them vertically.
History.
Tin can building in New Mexico originated in the early 1980s as a response to the massive amounts of trash being discarded and the wasteful nature of common building practices. Tin can construction was an attempt to utilize a readily available resource that was normally sent to landfills or recycling centers. This led to various experiments in tin can building, including space-filler between wooden frames in traditional house styles and creating domes and archways using cans and cement. Within time, more simplified and practical methods were developed, such as the earthship tin can wall. The main person behind these efforts was Mike Reynolds, also creator of the earthship building method.
Construction.
A “traditional” earthship tin can wall is made by horizontally stacking tin cans in a concrete matrix. The cans are laid side by side and in alternating rows, similar to bricks. This is done simply and efficiently, using batches of concrete between the cans. The consistency of the concrete must be relatively thick, so as to hold its form and the tin cans in place. A surprisingly large number of cans are required.
The method for stacking the cans involves creating a row of cans separated by hand-formed “lumps” of concrete. The layout of a row is can, concrete, can, etc. This is then repeated, except that the alternating pattern is reversed, so that every can is laid on top of a concrete “lump” below it. This continues until completed, or the weight of the wall and the hardness of the cement seem questionable in terms of solidity. At that point it would be wise to wait for the wall to harden, but the laying time for cans and concrete is such that by the time a builder makes it back to an area that was recently laid it has had time to set. It is a judgment call as to whether or not the builder should continue, but by the next day or even later in the same day building can resume.
Materials.
The materials that go into a tin can wall are simple: mainly tin cans and concrete. Tin cans (now aluminum cans as real tin cans are not as readily available) can be acquired from any recycling center or a local bar. Brick mortar may also be used instead of cement.
Coating.
Once the wall is completed, the cans and the concrete are covered with a layer of cement or adobe mud mixture. What is applied depends on the location of the wall; if it is located in an area where it will be exposed to water (such as in a bathroom or utility room) it will need to be coated with a concrete layer. If it is located in a living room or bedroom, it can be covered with adobe plaster. A tin can wall that has half of its structure outside (such as the wall of an entrance to a building) will be coated with cement on the outside and adobe on the inside. The shape of the cans (their pull-tabs, etc.) and the roughness of the cement will provide a lath-like surface for the cement or adobe to stick to.
This initial layer is “screeted” (scratched with a tool that creates a ridge-like pattern thereby making it easier to apply another coat) and a second layer is added. More layers may be added, but it is up to the builder’s judgment and dependent upon the material being applied. In the case of adobe mud, once the initial layer is applied and allowed to harden it will crack and will need additional coats. With cement fewer layers are needed. The basic rule is: the more coats/layers, the stronger and better-looking the wall will be. This can be overdone however. 
When a tin can wall has been sufficiently coated it will then be “finished” with a fine plaster (lime-based or other), stucco (if the wall is outside), or linseed oil (in the case of adobe). It can also be finished with a clay “slip”, or aliz, which is an earth-based coat that can have natural pigment and fine grains of mica mixed in to produce a beautiful shimmering and organic-looking surface.
Examples.
An outside tin can insulating wall is a simple design. It is made out of two tin can walls with a layer of solid insulation in the middle. The insulation can vary in thickness, depending on climate and budget. It can be made out of various “green” or sustainable materials or average run-of-the-mill solid insulation. The exposed sides of the tin can walls (those not facing the insulation) are finished using methods aforementioned. The inside part of the wall can be coated with adobe while the outside is finished with concrete and stucco. 
A door frame can be built into the can wall, or rather the can wall is built around the frame. The process involves initially having a door frame set in place (on the foundation) and stacking cans to either side of the frame until they reach the other walls of the building and the ceiling. The door frame is fastened to the tin can wall by hammering nails partially into the side of the frame that will touch the tin can wall and allowing the concrete to harden around the nails. Short strips of metal lath are also attached to the frame and folded out (perpendicular to the frame) and allowed to set in the can/concrete matrix.
The same method is applied to windows. The only difference is all sides of window are fastened to the tin can wall, while the door frame is fastened to the foundation on one side (bottom) and the can wall on three sides. Metal lath and nails are all that is needed, along with a bubble level or similar device. Once the desired height is reached to install a window frame, the wall is leveled. If any cans stick above the level plane they can be flattened to the desired height. Nails and lath sticking out from under the window frame holds the bottom of it in place, and the sides and top of the frame are fastened in the same fashion as a door frame. 
To make a smooth transition from door (or window frame) to tin can wall with plaster, sheets of metal lath are attached to the rim of the frame and folded over the gap between the frame and the can wall. A double-layered wooden frame is therefore required, to give a surface for the metal lath to be nailed to while leaving the inside frame untouched. However, this is not necessarily a necessity. 
Electrical wiring is simple, with the wires attached to the cans or fastened to the concrete before the initial coat. If a wire needs to go to the other side of a wall it can be punched directly through a can. Plumbing and pipework can use similar methods. The can wall can always be built around a pipe, or there can be a wooden frame made similar to a window or door to house the pipe.
Strength and use.
Tin can walls are not considered load-bearing using this building method, although two-story circular dome structures have been built. The basic rule is that it can support considerable weight but should not be used to hold up much more than its own form and shape. It would not be wise to attach a heavy timber roof to a tin can wall without support beams or frames. The basic function for can walls is in-fill (filling in the space between support beams or the main structure) and the division of space. They work excellent to separate a living room from a bedroom, and are also used as insulating walls from the outside. 
An earthship tin can wall is both an efficient and economical building method. They are mainly composed of aluminum and cement, and can withstand the test of time. They are made from few materials (the coating method can be more complex than building the wall itself). They use recycled materials and require little or no skill to build.
Alternative methods.
The other tin can wall method that will be briefly described is a system developed by a German artist named Michael Hönes. He has led community rebuilding efforts in Lesotho, Africa using tin cans to create housing and opportunities for Aids orphans and foster mothers. Known as the TCV (a.k.a. Tin-Can Villages) project, Hönes has created buildings using tin cans, masonite, paint, and wire. The roof is made out of corrugated metal shingles. In this method the cans are stacked vertically, one on top of the other in rows that are placed side by side and secured with wire. They are left exposed and are arranged in a decorative manner. The structures require no foundation, and are said to be able to withstand the Lesotho storms. 
A site for the first village in Maseru has been secured and the funding has been sourced. What is lacking is building permits (as of July 2004). The TCV organization, headed by Hönes, has been prefabricating tin can walls so that when the permits pass about one building a week can be constructed.
So far the TCV organization’s efforts have been concentrated on storehouses, offices, a large weaving workshop for the women of the Elelloang Basali Weavers group in Teyateyaneng, and a solar-powered restaurant that cooks with solar ovens. Michael Hönes also focuses on tin can furniture and has created a stove out of tin cans that uses one-third less wood than what the poor people of the area commonly use, thereby diminishing the firewood crisis in Lesotho.

Saint's triad

Saint's triad is a medical condition of concurrence of the following:
History.
Saint's triad is named after the British surgeon Prof C.F.M. Saint, who established the first school of surgery in South Africa. He emphasized the importance of considering the possibility of multiple separate diseases in a patient whenever his or her history and the results of the physical examination were atypical of any single condition. Traditionally, there is thought to be no pathophysiological basis for the coexistence of these three diseases. Saint emphasized that more than one disease may be responsible for a patient's clinical signs and symptoms, and his "triad" provides a counterexample to the commonly used diagnostic principle that "the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible," also known as Occam's Razor. The principle underlying Saint's triad is also expressed as Hickam's dictum.
Recent evidence.
A twist to this philosophic discussion on the art of diagnosis is that, in recent times, the possibility of an underlying pathophysiology has been considered—obesity is associated with gallstones, hiatal hernia, and diverticular disease, and there is the suggestion of an underlying connective tissue defect such as a "herniosis."

Perigean spring tide

A perigean spring tide is a tide that occurs three or four times a year when the Moon's perigee (its closest point to Earth during its 28-day elliptical orbit) coincides with a spring tide (when the Earth, Sun and Moon are nearly aligned every two weeks).
The Moon's orbit around the Earth is elliptical, which causes the Moon to be closer to the Earth and farther away at different times. The Moon and the Sun are aligned every two weeks, which results in spring tides – tides that are 20% higher than normal. During the period of the new moon, the Moon and Sun are on the same side of the Earth, so the high tides or bulges produced independently by each reinforce each other (and has nothing to do with the season called spring). Tides of maximum height and depression produced during this period are known as spring tide. Even higher than a normal spring tide are the perigean tides. Perigean spring tides can produce unusually intense flooding along the coastal regions. Low amplitude tides are known as neap tides.
The Moon is the primary source of the gravitational forces that cause the tides. The proximity of the Moon to the Earth has an effect on the range of the tides at any given time. In each of its 28-day elliptical orbits, the Moon reaches a perigee, its closest point of approach to the Earth. During these periods, there is a slight increase in the average range of tides. The increases in the range of the tides is seen by a slightly higher than average high tide, as well as a slightly lower than average low tide. Additionally, twice each month, around the times of the new moon and full moon, when the Earth, Sun, and Moon are nearly in line, there is an increase in the average range of the tides. These are called "spring tides". Three or four times a year, the occurrence of a new or full moon will coincide with the perigee of the Moon, which Fergus Wood has termed the "perigean spring tides". 
On March 6, 1962, the Ash Wednesday Storm surge coincided with perigean spring tide, and for the following 65 hours inundated the entire Atlantic coastline of the United States from the Carolinas to Cape Cod. This disastrous event resulted in a loss of 40 lives and over 500 million dollars of property damage. On January 4, 1912 a full moon and a lunar perigee occurred, with these two events separated by only a few minutes of time and with the Earth near perihelion. The resulting lunar distance (356,375 km) on that date stands as the closest approach of the Moon to the Earth in an interval of more than 1400 years.
In some countries a perigean spring tide may be called a "king tide".

List of Red Hot Chili Peppers band members

Red Hot Chili Peppers is an alternative rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1983. The band was formed by vocalist Anthony Kiedis, guitarist Hillel Slovak, bassist Michael "Flea" Balzary, and drummer Jack Irons after they met while attending Fairfax High School. Since its inception, Red Hot Chili Peppers has maintained a four member lineup, with fourteen official members overall.
In late 1983, two weeks before signing with EMI, Slovak and Irons had obtained a record deal with MCA Records with their other band, What Is This?, and left Red Hot Chili Peppers. Rather than dissolving the band, Kiedis and Flea decided to recruit new members. Cliff Martinez was hired as the band's new drummer while Martinez's bandmate in The Weirdos, guitarist, Dix Denney was expected to replace Slovak however after a few rehearsals the band felt he didn't fit and auditions continued. It was down to guitarist Mark Nine and Jack Sherman, a guy the band knew nothing about however after practicing with Sherman they that he was the best fit because he worked well with Flea and Martinez. With Martinez and Sherman aboard, the band released their eponymous debut album on August 10, 1984. During the ensuing tour, continuing musical and lifestyle tension between Kiedis and Sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life. Sherman was fired soon after, with Slovak returning to the Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?. At one point, Chuck Biscuits filled in on drums during the 1985 tour. The band dismissed Cliff Martinez from the group in April 1986 due to personal differences and replaced him with founding member Jack Irons, who was out of work and finally separated from other commitments. During this period, however, Kiedis and Slovak had both developed serious drug addictions, which resulted in Kiedis being briefly fired that same year. At one performance, longtime friend and then Circle Jerks frontman, Keith Morris filled in for an absent Kiedis who was out scoring drugs while his band was playing a show. On June 25, 1988, Slovak died of a heroin overdose shortly after the completion of "The Uplift Mofo Party Plan" tour. Kiedis would then retreat into hiding, further fueling his drug habit and even skipping Slovak's funeral. After a band meeting with manager, Lindy Goetz, Irons subsequently left the group, saying that he did not want to be part of a band where his friends were dying.
Attempting to cope with the death of Slovak and the departure of Irons, Kiedis and Flea temporarily employed Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro and former P-Funk guitarist DeWayne McKnight. McKnight's tenure was brief, lasting three shows in September 1988 before he was fired. He was quickly replaced by John Frusciante in October 1988 and writing for the next album quickly began. Peligro however was dealing with personal substance problems of his own and would last a few more months before he too was fired. Despite several open auditions, the band remained without a drummer. One of the final drummers to audition was Chad Smith, who Kiedis said was so proficient on the drums he "ate for breakfast". After another successful jam session, Kiedis, Frusciante and Flea admitted Smith into the Chili Peppers and was hired in November 1988.
During the 1992 Japanese leg of the "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" tour, Frusciante, overwhelmed by the band's new-found success and his drug addiction, abruptly quit in May 1992. Circle Jerks bassist Zander Schloss was auditioned but after four days of rehearsing, Kiedis, Flea, and Smith decided that Schloss did not fit with their future plans. The band originally had wanted Dave Navarro as their guitarist but Navarro's band, Jane's Addiction had just broken up and he wasn't ready to join another band. With a major summer tour planned including a headlining spot at Lollapalooza, guitarist Arik Marshall of L.A. band Marshall Law was hired as Frusciante's official replacement and would finish out the remainder of tour with the band. Coming off their most successful tour the band was excited to start recording their next album however during pre-production of their sixth studio album, tensions grew between the band and Marshall, and they dismissed him from the band in early 1993. Shortly following Marshall's firing the band attempted to hold open auditions but they proved to be a failure although Buckethead was one of the guitarists to audtition. Kiedis attended a show by local L.A. band, Mother Tongue and quickly was drawn to the band's guitarist, Jesse Tobias. Tobias was recruited after a series of open auditions; however, his tenure with the band was brief and after weeks of writing and rehearsals for the next album the band stated that "the chemistry wasn't right" and he was fired although the band already had his replacement ready. Chad was friends with and in contact with Navarro, whom he said was now ready to join the band so on September 5, 1993 Navarro was officially hired as the band's seventh guitarist and work quickly began on the band's next record, "One Hot Minute", which would be released in 1995 and was seen as a disappointment in sales compared to their previous album.
The band's One Hot Minute tour proved to be successful however for the band it could easily be viewed as a disaster. Navarro never felt he fit properly in the band and the chemistry just wasn't there with him. Following attempts to write and rehearse for their seventh studio album, in April 1998, it was announced that Navarro had been fired from the band due to creative differences; Kiedis stated that the decision was "mutual". With the band on the brink of a break-up, Kiedis informed Flea that he felt the only way the band could continue is if Frusicante would return. Flea surprised Kiedis by stating he had been in contact with Frusciante and had a feeling he might be open to rejoining. That same month after Navarro's departure, Flea visited Frusciante and invited him to rejoin the band. An emotional and now sober Frusciante readily accepted the invitation. With Frusciante back, the band went on to release three of their most successful albums; 1999's "Californication", 2002's "By the Way" and 2006's "Stadium Arcadium".
In late 2007 following the band's Stadium Arcadium tour, the Red Hot Chili Peppers went on a hiatus, with Kiedis citing exhaustion as the main reason. The band's hiatus lasted until October 2009 when they started to write and rehearse for their tenth album however absent from these rehearsals was Fruciante although present was the band's touring guitarist, Josh Klinghoffer leading many to speculate Frusciante had again left the band. In December 2009, Frusciante posted a message on his official website announcing his departure from the band which he stated happened earlier that year. He stated that he left Red Hot Chili Peppers during the hiatus to focus on a solo career. Klinghoffer, who acted as a sideman during 2007 dates on the band's Stadium Arcadium tour and on John Frusciante's solo projects, joined the band on October 12, 2009; however, his membership was not announced until February 8, 2010. With Klinghoffer, the band saw this as a new beginning and in August 2011 they released their tenth-studio album, "I'm with You". During this tour, the band added backing musicians, Mauro Refosco and Chris Warren (also Smith's drum technician) to their touring lineup.
On April 14, 2012, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted by Chris Rock into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kieids, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer (who became the youngest inductee ever), Frusciante, Slovak, Irons and Martinez were the members inducted. Slovak was inducted on behalf of his brother, James while Frusciante, who was invited, declined the band's offer and didn't show up although was heavily praised during the induction speech by his former bandmates. Despite their contributions to the band's studio albums, Jack Sherman and Dave Navarro were neither inducted or invited to the ceremony for reasons unknown.
Both Martinez and Irons joined the band (marking the first time either drummer had performed with the Chili Peppers since their departures from the band in the 80s) onstage for a performance of "Give It Away" and "Higher Ground", which ended up in an all-star jam involving some of the night's inductees and other guest musicians.
Members.
Current.
, the lineup of Red Hot Chili Peppers includes one vocalist, one bassist, one drummer, and one guitarist.
Former.
The former members of Red Hot Chili Peppers consist of seven guitarists and three drummers.
Touring and studio musicians.
Red Hot Chili Peppers has employed numerous touring and studio musicians throughout its career. A touring or studio musician is an unofficial member who will perform live or contribute in the studio with the band although is not considered an official member. Vicki Calhoun, Keith Barry, and Philip Fisher did contribute to "Mother's Milk" (1989), where Calhoun performed backing vocals on "Knock Me Down", "Higher Ground", "Good Time Boys", and "Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky", Barry played tenor sax on "Subway to Venus", and Fisher provided drums on "Taste the Pain". Josh Klinghoffer was featured as a backing musician on the final half of the band's "Stadium Arcadium tour" and eventually become an official member replacing guitarist John Frusciante in 2009. The band's "I'm with You Tour" and its following tour features percussionist, Mauro Refosco. Refosco provided percussion for most of the tracks on the band's "I'm with You" album and related releases. The band's longtime roadie/drum tech, Chris Warren, also has joined the touring lineup providing keyboards on the most recent tours.
The band has also seen musicians such as Keith Morris and Chuck Biscuits briefly fill in for a show or two. Morris, who was fronting the Circle Jerks at the time, filled in for Kiedis for a show in 1986. Kiedis was off scoring drugs and missed the band's performance so they asked Morris to fill in however Morris didn't know any of the lyrics to the songs so he screamed and yelled his way through the show. Drummer Chuck Biscuits also briefly filled in on drums back in 1985.

Enrofloxacin

Enrofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic sold by the Bayer Corporation under the trade name Baytril. Enrofloxacin is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of individual pets and domestic animals in the United States. In September 2005, the FDA withdrew approval of Baytril for use in water to treat flocks of poultry, as this practice was noted to promote the evolution of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of the bacterium "Campylobacter", a human pathogen. Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin are widely used in the treatment of human disease.
It is a bactericidal agent. The bactericidal activity of enrofloxacin is concentration-dependent, with susceptible bacteria cell death occurring within 20–30 minutes of exposure. Enrofloxacin has demonstrated a significant post-antibiotic effect for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and is active in both stationary and growth phases of bacterial replication.
Activity.
Enrofloxacin is a synthetic antibacterial agent from the class of the fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivatives. It has antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Its mechanism of action is not thoroughly understood, but it is believed to act by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase (a type-II topoisomerase), thereby preventing DNA supercoiling and DNA synthesis. It is effective against:
Variable activity against:
Ineffective against:
Contraindications/precautions.
Usage in poultry.
Adverse effects/warnings.
Enrofloxacin was banned for poultry use in 2005 
Baytril should not be used in rapidly growing animals (for example dogs under 12 months - 18 months in large breeds, or kittens under 8 weeks) as it causes abnormalities in the development of articular cartilage.
Overdosage/acute toxicity.
It is unlikely that an acute overdose of either compound would result in symptoms more serious than either anorexia or vomiting, but the adverse effects noted above could occur. Dogs receiving 10 times the labeled dosage rate of enrofloxacin for at least 14 days developed only vomiting and anorexia. Death did occur in some dogs when fed 25 times the labeled rate for 11 days, however.
Degradation.
The brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum striatum can degrade the fluoroquinolone enrofloxacin using hydroxyl radicals.

Auckland East

Auckland East was a New Zealand electorate, situated in the east of Auckland.
History.
The Auckland East electorate was established for the 1860-1861 elections, when the Auckland electorate was split in half. It consisted of most of modern Auckland's central business district. Its boundaries remained largely static until 1875-1876 elections, when the focus of the electorate shifted eastwards, making room for Auckland North electorate. It was abolished in the 1887 elections, with most of its territory being absorbed by the neighbouring Parnell electorate.
At the 1905 elections, a new electorate of the same name was created, again by abolishing a multi-member seat called City of Auckland. The boundaries of the new Auckland East were similar to those of the original, although its borders often shifted. By the 1938 elections, it had lost most of the central business district, and was more focused on Parnell, Newmarket, and Grafton. It was abolished in the 1946 elections, with most of its territory becoming part of a re-established Parnell electorate.
The first seat called Auckland East existed before political parties. The second seat was initially held by the Liberals, but later swung to the rising Labour Party, with the United Party (the Liberals' successor) capturing it only once after its initial loss. The seat also briefly belonged to the Reform Party, which captured it in a by-election but was unable to keep it.
Emily Maguire contested the for the Reform Party, but was unsuccessful against James Donald of the United Party.

The Walter Lewin Lectures on Physics are a set of three courses including video lectures on physics by MIT Physics Professor Walter Lewin. He explains the basics of classical mechanics, electricity, magnetism, vibrations, waves and introductory topics on astrophysics. It was prepared in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has been used by more than four million students, teachers and self-learners around the world.
Overview.
Many of Dr. Walter Lewin's lectures have been shown for over six years on UWTV in Seattle, reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs, which were aired 24 hours per day, were also frequently watched by upper-class students. Lewin is the soul of PIVoT, a video course on Newtonian mechanics with a total of 53 hours of video clips. Additionally, his 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed from the course's web site. Finally, his special lectures given at MIT for science teachers and for middle school students can be viewed on MIT World. The three sets of video lectures are separated into classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism and vibrations and waves. All of the video lectures are available for free from MIT OpenCourseWare.
Classical mechanics.
8.01 is a first-semester freshman physics class in Newtonian mechanics, fluid mechanics, and kinetic gas theory at MIT. In addition to the basic concepts of Newtonian mechanics, fluid mechanics, and kinetic gas theory, a variety of interesting topics are covered in this course: binary stars, neutron stars, black holes, resonance phenomena, musical instruments, stellar collapse, supernovae, Astronomical observations from very high flying balloons (lecture 35), and a peek into the intriguing quantum world.
Electricity and magnetism.
8.02 is a second-semester freshman physics class in electromagnetism at MIT. The 36 video lectures on Electricity and Magnetism, by Professor Lewin, were recorded on the MIT campus during the Spring of 2002. Prof. Lewin is well-known at MIT and beyond for his dynamic and engaging lecture style.
This class includes many topics, specially the classical theory of electromagnetism. In addition to the basic concepts of electromagnetism, a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course: lightning, pacemakers, electric shock treatment, electrocardiograms, metal detectors, musical instruments, magnetic levitation, bullet trains, electric motors, radios, TV, car coils, superconductivity, aurora borealis, rainbows, radio telescopes, interferometers, particle accelerators (a.k.a. atom smashers or colliders), mass spectrometers, red sunsets, blue skies, haloes around Sun and Moon, color perception, Doppler effect, Big-Bang cosmology.
Vibrations and waves.
8.03 deals with lots of topics in physics dealing with Vibrations and Waves. Topics include: Mechanical vibrations and waves; simple harmonic motion, superposition, forced vibrations and resonance, coupled oscillations and normal modes; vibrations of continuous systems; reflection and refraction; phase and group velocity. Optics; wave solutions to Maxwell's equations; polarization; Snell's Law, interference, Huygens' principle, Fraunhofer diffraction and gratings.
In addition to the traditional topics of mechanical vibrations and waves, coupled oscillators, and electro-magnetic radiation, students also learn about musical instruments, red sunsets, glories, coronae, rainbows, haloes, X-ray binaries, neutron stars, black holes and Big-Bang cosmology.

FSV Budissa Bautzen

FSV Budissa Bautzen is a German association football club from Bautzen, Saxony. Founded as "Fußball Klub Budissa Bautzen" on 24 May 1904, the club was part of East German competition after World War II.
History.
"FK" played in the VMBV (Verband Mittledeutschland Ballspiel Vereins or Central German Federation of Ballsport Teams), one of the country's early regional leagues. They were renamed "Sportverein Budissa 04" in 1907 and went on to claim several local championships in the Gau Oberlausitz in the 1910s and again in the early 1930s. This led to several appearances in the regional championship round where they were eliminated in the early going. By the time World War II broke out in 1939 "SVB" was playing third tier ball on the local circuit.
After the war occupying Allied authorities banned existing organizations in the country, including sports and football clubs. "Budissa" was re-established in 1946 as "Sparte Süd", but was soon playing as "Sportgemeinde Bautzen-Süd". In 1949, that club merged with "SG Bautzen-West" (successor of "Bautzner SC") to form "BSG Einheit Bautzen". The following year the club was renamed BSG Motor Bautzen.
The team soon earned a Bezirksliga (III) title that advanced them to East Germany's second division DDR-Liga in 1954. League re-structuring the next season saw "Bautzen" in the third division 2.DDR-Liga where they would compete until winning their way back to the DDR-Liga (II) in 1958. After a couple of close brushes with relegation the club was sent back down after the 1960 campaign, but immediately re-claimed a place in second tier play, remaining there until the 1967–68 season. Except for a brief return to the DDR-Liga in 1974–1976, "Motor" spent the next two dozen seasons bouncing between third and fourth division play.
Throughout this period, the club was a regular participant in the opening rounds of the FDGB-Pokal (East German Cup), but did not enjoy any success in play there.
After German re-unification in 1990 the club re-claimed its heritage and re-established itself as "Fußballspielvereinigung Budissa Bautzen". They made a brief two-season appearance in the Landesliga Sachsen (V) in 1992–94. "FSV" was promoted to the Landesliga a second time in 2002 and this time captured the 2005 championship to advance to the Oberliga Nordost-Süd where they currently play.

<doc id="9904836" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9904836" title="Oguchi disease">
Oguchi disease

Oguchi disease, also called congenital stationary night blindness, Oguchi type 1 or Oguchi disease 1, is an autosomal recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness associated with fundus discoloration and abnormally slow dark adaptation.
Clinical features.
Oguchi disease present with nonprogressive night blindness since young childhood or birth with normal day vision, but they frequently claim improvement of light sensitivities when they remain for some time in a darkened environment.
On examination patients have normal visual fields but the fundi have a diffuse or patchy, silver-gray or golden-yellow metallic sheen and the retinal vessels stand out in relief against the background.
A prolonged dark adaptation of three hours or more, leads to disappearance of this unusual discoloration and the appearance of a normal reddish appearance. This is known as the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomena and is thought to be caused by the overstimulation of rod cells.
Differential diagnosis.
Other conditions with similar appearing fundi include
These conditions do not show the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon.
Electroretinographic studies.
Oguchi's disease is unique in its electroretinographic responses in the light- and dark-adapted conditions. The A- and b-waves on single flash electroretinograms (ERG) are decreased or absent under lighted conditions but increase after prolonged dark adaptation. There are nearly undetectable rod b waves in the scotopic 0.01 ERG and nearly negative scotopic 3.0 ERGs.
Dark-adaptation studies have shown that highly elevated rod thresholds decrease several hours later and eventually result in a recovery to the normal or nearly normal level.
The S, M and L cone systems are normal.
Cause and Genetics.
Several mutations have been implicated as a cause of Oguchi disease. These include mutations in the arrestin gene or the rhodopsin kinase gene.
The condition is more frequent in individuals of Japanese ethnicity.
History.
It was described by Chuta Oguchi (1875-1945), a Japanese ophthalmologist, in 1907. The characteristic fundal appearances were described by Mizuo in 1913.

The New Adventures of Blinky Bill

The New Adventures of Blinky Bill was an Australian puppet series that ran on ABC Television from 1984 to 1987. After production ended, it remained on air in repeats until 1991. Twenty-eight 30 minute episodes were made and the producer was Richard Smith.
Plot.
The show was a follow on from the original Blinky Bill books by Dorothy Wall. Set in the fictional Bollygum National Park, characters include Blinky Bill, Mrs Magpie, Angelina Wallaby and Walter Wombat from the books, and new characters such as Charlie Goanna, Eric Echidna, Sybilla Snake and Kerry Koala from the neighbouring fictional Acadia Ridge park.
Cast.
Most episodes also featured at least one guest actor in a human character role. These guests included David Waters, Maggie Kirkpatrick, Joanne Samuel, Paul Chubb, Mike Meade (Actor), Benita Collings and many others.
Production.
The series was unique for its production style. The puppets were designed and made by the late Beverley Campbell-Jackson, who chose to use a thick and fluffy yarn to knit the outer skin of the marsupial characters, which gave them their furry look on camera. Charlie's skin was made from a patterned lurex which gave him a distinctive look in sunlight. She designed internal mechanisms which used triggers to control the movements of each character's head, mouth and eyelids; while rods to each hand controlled arm movements. Each puppeteer used one hand for the trigger mechanism, and one hand to control both arm rods (this skill is somewhat like advanced chopsticks technique). Similar techniques are seen in some forms of Japanese puppetry.
At the time of shooting, the ABC network owned studios in the Sydney bush suburb of Frenchs Forest, and the show was recorded using multi-camera and live sound recording on the back lot, with the puppeteers voicing the characters at the same time as operating the puppets. The only time that they would used one Camera was the scenes with Blinky Bill and Charlie Goanna talking in Blinky's Tree. Ross Browning and Alan Highfield Blinky and Charlie's Puppeteers would bet on who could complete the scene the fastest. The Outside Broadcast unit provided crew, equipment and the control room. Some sets, including the ranger's hut and Walter Wombat's general store, were built permanently on location, while others were constructed as required for each episode. Sets were raised by a metre or so, to allow space underneath for puppeteers to stand or kneel. Only one scene - featuring a rock and roll performance by Blinky, Kerry and Charlie - was shot in a studio.
The puppet performers wrote roughly half the episodes. Other writers included Heather March, Mark Page and Morris Gleitzman, who is now a well-known author of children's books.
Every time the ABC wanted to make another series they had to asked permission of Angus & Robertson to shoot the next series of episodes. ABC were asked to pay a higher license from Angus & Robertson. ABC did not known of Yoram Gross and Angus & Robertson negotiating behind the scenes to make the animated Blinky Bill (film). In 1987 after the filming of the final season of The New Adventures of Blinky Bill. Richard Smith was thinking of making a One Hour Christmas Special of Blinky Bill. But because they had finished filming the final Season. It never came to be.
In 1994, Blinky Bill returned to ABC television in the animated series, "The Adventures of Blinky Bill", after which the ABC did not screen the puppet series again, a prospect that has become unlikely due to the conviction of Robert Hughes on sex offences.

Henry Chamberlain Russell

Henry Chamberlain Russell, CMG, FRS, (17 March 1836 – 22 February 1907) was an Australian astronomer and meteorologist. 
Early life.
Russell was born at West Maitland, New South Wales, the fourth son of the Hon. Bourn Russell and his wife Jane, "née" Mackreth. Russell was educated at West Maitland Grammar school and the University of Sydney, (B.A., 1859).
Sydney Observatory.
Russell joined the staff of the Sydney Observatory under William Scott who resigned in 1862. Russell then became acting director until 1864 until the new government astronomer, George Smalley, was appointed. On the death of Smalley on 11 July 1870 
Russell became government astronomer a salary of £555 and held the position for 35 years. Russell immediately began reorganizing and refurnishing the building, which he succeeded in getting considerably enlarged during the next seven years. With Robert L. J. Ellery, Russell organised an expedition to observe a total eclipse of the sun to Cape Sidmouth in 1871.
Russell prepared for the observation of the transit of Venus in 1874 for which four observing stations were equipped. Russell arranged for a band of competent observers to staff them, and the results were generally very successful; an interesting account of them was published by Russell in 1892, "Observations of the Transit of Venus". 
Meteorology career.
Russell began to develop the meteorological side of his work, in 1877 he published a substantial volume, "Climate of New South Wales: Descriptive, Historical and Tabular". In this volume some attention is given to the question of weather periodicity, on which he had written a paper in 1876. In later years he gave a great deal of attention to it. At the beginning of Russell's appointment there were only 12 observing stations in New South Wales, but before he resigned there were about 1800. There was little money for equipment, but Russell made use of available materials and designed a rain gauge which could be made at a cost of one-sixth of the imported gauges. Russell also invented various self-recording barometers, thermometers, anemometers and rain gauges. This reduced and made possible the work of his observers, almost all of whom gave their services voluntarily. In collaboration with Sir Charles Todd of South Australia, and Robert L. J. Ellery and Pietro Baracchi of Victoria, weather reporting in Australia was co-ordinated until the daily weather forecasts showed a very high percentage of accuracy. The long series of "Meteorological Observations made at the Government Observatory, Sydney", published under Russell's direction contain an enormous mass of information relating to the climate of New South Wales.
Russell was interested in the study of double stars and published in 1882 "Results of Double Star Measures made at the Sydney Observatory 1871 to 1881". He also gave a great deal of attention to the application of photography to astronomical work. In 1887 he attended the astrographic congress at Paris and arranged for the co-operation of the Sydney observatory. This involved the taking and measurement of 1400 photographic plates. Russell supervised the preparation of the portion of the astrographic catalogue undertaken by the Sydney observatory until his retirement. In 1888 he was elected president of the newly formed Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1891 became vice-chancellor of the university of Sydney, but resigned within a year on account of the pressure of his other duties. By 1893 Russell had discovered 500 new double stars. In 1903 Russell had a severe illness from which he never completely recovered. He had a year's leave of absence and resigned the position of government astronomer in 1905. Russell died at the observatory on 22 February 1907. Russell was for some years president of the Royal Society of New South Wales, was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1886, and was created C.M.G. in 1890. Russell contributed papers to various societies, many of which appeared in the "Memoirs" and "Monthly Notices" of the Royal Astronomical Society. Others papers will be found in the "Journal and Proceedings" of the Royal Society of New South Wales, and other journals. He also took an important part in the initiation of technical education in New South Wales.
Family.
Russell married Emily Jane, daughter of Ambrose Foss, who survived him with a son and four daughters.
Legacy.
Russell was a conscientious and enthusiastic worker; his hours of attendance at the observatory were commonly from nine in the morning until midnight. He was an excellent mechanic and was responsible for many inventions which proved to be of great value in relation with his work. His theory of a 19 years cycle in weather periodicity could not be proved on the information available, and the same may be said of the 33 years cycle of Charles Egeson, an assistant of Russell's at the observatory. Russell's paper on the Darling River read in 1879, suggesting that vast supplies of water must be flowing at a lower level was a very interesting prediction considering that artesian water was practically unknown at the time. But, however interesting these theories may have been, the great value of Russell's efforts lies in the mass of tabulated work done by him or under his direction in astronomy and especially meteorology, which has been a mine of information for all workers in the subjects.

This facility houses locker rooms, offices and training facilities for 11 of HPU's 16 varsity sports. Ironically, the men's and women's basketball teams are those excluded from this facility, due to the large amount of office space required for the two revenue-earning sports, as well as the former athletic administration's offices' proximity to the varsity basketball arena floor and locker rooms, which the basketball coaches moved into in April 2007.

Lesley Webber

Dr. Lesley Webber ("née" Williams; previously Faulkner) is a fictional character on the ABC soap opera, "General Hospital". She was played by Denise Alexander from 1973 through February 28, 1984 on contract and from 1996 to 2009 in a recurring status. Alexander returned to the series in 2013.
Casting.
Actress Denise Alexander originated the role of Dr. Lesley Williams in March 1973. In 1976, although TIME magazine panned "General Hospital" at the time, Alexander's character Lesley was noted as the serial's saving grace. When Alexander and the network could not agree to contractual negotiations, the character was killed off in March 1984. Angry fans picketed the studio, upset that the character had died. In 1996, the series wrote the character back on, and Alexander appeared in a recurring status until October 2009. Alexander returned to the role, once again in a recurring status, on May 16, 2013.
Storylines.
1973–84.
Lesley came to Port Charles in March 1973 and immediately joined the staff at General Hospital. Florence Gray became one of Lesley's first patients. Florence was suffering from stomach ulcers, which she thought were caused by her troubled marriage with Gordon Gray. She started seeing psychiatrist Peter Taylor. Florence told Peter about her husband's affair with one of her students years earlier. He had gotten her pregnant but the child died at birth. Peter told Lesley about Florence's history and is shocked to find out that she was that very student who had the affair with Gordon. He reentered Lesley's life and confessed his love to her. Gordon was about to leave Florence and start a new life with Lesley. She asked Dr. Steve Hardy to be taken off the case. Lesley convinced Gordon to stay with his wife. She was then tormented by the memories of giving birth, and losing her daughter.
Shortly after Lesley got married to Cameron Faulkner, she found out that the daughter who she thought has died was only living miles from her away. Lesley did a little research and found out that her daughter Laura was adopted by Jason and Barbara Vining. Lesley was desperate to see her daughter again, but Cameron ordered her to stay away from Laura and never make contact to her. Lesley started meeting Laura anyway. Barbara and Jason got curious about Laura's new friendship and soon had to realize that Lesley was Laura's biological mother. As Laura found out the truth, she is thrilled. Lesley is later granted full custody of Laura. When Laura fell ill and Peter told her that the illness was emotional based, Lesley decided to return Laura to the Vinings. Cameron was thrilled about that development. Lesley couldn't get over losing Laura again. Cameron started an affair with his secretary Peggy and was determined to get Laura out of Lesley's life for good. He first paid an elderly nurse to convince Lesley that Laura isn't even her daughter. As this didn't work, Cameron paid the Vinings a lot of money to move away with Laura. When Lesley found out about Cameron's scheme to keep her from her daughter, he kidnapped Lesley. As Cameron was driving Lesley grabbed the steering wheel and the car lunged off the road killing Cameron.
Lesley's colleague Rick Webber started comforting Lesley. As Rick tried to stay away from his brother's wife Monica, he spent more time with Lesley and helped her over the miscarriage of her late husband's baby. Monica became jealous over Rick's friendship with Lesley. Monica confronted Lesley, told her to stay away from Rick and that they were having an affair. Rick and Lesley got closer anyway and Rick helped Lesley to find Laura. Lesley was left crushed when Laura wanted to have nothing to do with her anymore. Rick eventually got through to Laura, telling her how much Lesley loved her and that she never gave up on her. Lesley was grateful to Rick and filled with joy when he confessed his love for her and proposed. Lesley and Rick were eventually married.
A man by the name of David Hamilton was admitted to General Hospital and turns out to be an old college friend of Rick's. David's wife and children were killed, while David was left paralyzed. The doctors couldn't find out why David was unable to walk and he was released. He accepted Rick's offer to stay with him and Lesley to recuperate. While Lesley thought something was strange about David, Laura cared for him. Soon David got his own apartment and tried to make a pass at Lesley who rejected him. Lesley confessed to Rick's brother Jeff about what happened with David. Jeff swore he wouldn't tell Rick. David moved on to Laura after Lesley rejected him and started a secret romantic relationship with the young girl. David was only using Laura to get to Lesley. As David told Laura the truth, that he was really in love with Lesley, Laura pushed David to fall. Lesley later discovered David's body. In an effort to protect Laura, Lesley decided to confess to murdering David. Laura felt guilty and ran away. She eventually returned and confessed to the murder. The charges against Lesley were dropped and Laura sentenced to six months probation.
Lesley and Rick's marriage became troubled when Lesley started to think that Rick and Monica were having another affair. As General Hospital was put under quarantine, Monica and Rick were among the doctors working at the hospital. After everyone was free from the quarantine Monica and Rick slept together. While Monica was sure of her feelings for Rick, he told her that they would need time to figure things out. Laura's car accident let Rick rethink his involvement with Monica and he told her that they are over for good. Monica reconciled with her husband, Alan Quartermaine, as she discovered that she is pregnant. In the meanwhile, Lesley and Rick started to think about a baby of their own. But Lesley was unable to conceive as it would put her life in danger. Lesley ended up delivering Monica's baby. As Monica feared that she wouldn't survive, she tells Lesley that the baby is Rick's. Lesley and Rick separated after he tried to tell her about his affair with Monica and Lesley told him that she already was aware. Rick found out that Alan Jr. could be his son and filed a suite against Monica. Lesley, still being in love with Rick, supported him and even agreed to a divorce so that he could claim his son. It was later discovered that Alan Jr. was in fact Alan's son and not Rick's.
Lesley and Rick remarried and adopted a six-year old boy named Mike. As Laura disappeared and was presumed dead, Lesley was crushed and had a hard time dealing with the fact that her daughter is dead. Lesley and Rick eventually became foster parents to Blackie Parrish after his mother died. When Blackie entered the music business, Rick noticed a change in Blackie's personality. He became arrogant and shallow. Blackie ends up accidentally killing his girlfriend Lou. He was arrested and sentenced to time in prison.
An old enemy of Rick's, D. L. Brock, comes to town. He wants revenge on Rick for closing his cannery when Rick was part of the Port Charles Health Commission. Brock brings Ginny Blake to town, who's claiming to be Mike's biological mother. Bobbie Spencer, Brock's wife, figured out that Ginny might be in on the revenge against Rick and warned Lesley. She confronted Ginny and then Lesley ended up in a car accident and was killed.
1996–2005.
It was revealed that Lesley was in fact alive in 1996. Stefan Cassadine, son of Mikkos and brother of Stavros who had kidnapped Laura years ago was keeping Lesley drugged in a catatonic state. Lesley and Laura were reunited and, with Luke's help, they faked their deaths to escape the Cassadines. When they returned months later, their friends and family turned against them out of hurt. Stefan blackmailed Laura into leaving town once more. She lied to Luke that her mother needed treatment in Switzerland and took Lulu with them. In 1998, they returned and Lesley took over being a mother to Laura and grandmother to Laura's sons Nikolas and Lucky and daughter Lesley Lu.
In 2002, Rick Webber returned to give his daughter Laura away again at her second wedding to Luke Spencer. Rick was happy to see Lesley alive and well again but his return made Laura remember some terrible events. She began having flashbacks involving the garage attic, including wearing a dress covered in blood. Rick and Scott Baldwin could tell that Laura was remembering and tried to prevent the truth from coming out. Years ago Rick was having an affair with nurse Theresa Carter and Laura walked in on them in the attic. Theresa had gotten violent and Laura took an antique camera and hit Theresa over the head with it. It killed her and Rick and Scott buried her in the back yard. Rick then gave Laura a certain drug for her to forget that night.
2006–09.
In October 2006, Luke gave Robin Scorpio, now a doctor, his permission to give Laura an experimental drug called LS-49 that would temporarily bring her out of her catatonic state. The drug worked and everyone in Laura's life were overjoyed to have her back for the 3 weeks. In that time. Laura made Luke take her back to the Scorpio attic so she could remember what happened between her and Rick Webber the night she killed her stepfather four years ago; she painfully, tearfully did remember. Lesley, along with Laura's children, the Quartermaines, and the rest of LnL's loved ones were in attendance at Luke and Laura got remarried like they were going to do before Laura had her breakdown. The lavish ceremony took place in Lila's rose garden per Laura's wishes. The marriage was fake however as Luke was married to Tracy Quartermaine at the time. The minister who performed the ceremony was only an actor who Luke had hired to perform it. He only went along with it because it meant so much to Laura and he wanted to make what time she had left as meaningful and memorable as possible. Lesley and the rest were devastated when Laura slowly but finally slipped back into her catatonic state. Before her goodbye with Lulu, Laura told her daughter that she didn't believe that she had actually killed Rick Webber, but not to tell Luke this because it would break his heart. (Luke telling Laura that she killed her stepfather is what actually pushed her to really have her breakdown and into her catatonic state) Lulu vowed to pursue the matter and find Rick's real killer.
After Alan died from a heart attack during the Metro Court Hotel hostage crisis during February sweeps, Lulu and her stepbrother Dillon Quartermaine intercepted a letter addressed to Luke which was to be delivered to him after Alan's death. In the letter, it says that Scott Baldwin is actually the one who killed Rick that night. When Lulu confronts a recently returned to town during the hostage crisis Scott about the letter, he eventually confirms it. He went to the Scorpio house that night to check on Laura and upon hearing her scream found her in the attic fighting with Rick. He was the one who hit him on the head with the candlestick, unintentionally killing him, to stop him from giving Laura the drug. He left just before Luke arrived on the scene and came to the only possible conclusion that he could think of: in an altercation, with Laura's current state of mind, she thought Rick was trying to hurt her so she hit him with the now bloody candlestick and accidentally killed him. Telling her this is what sent her into her catatonic state. Lulu decided that she could never tell her father what she has learned because it would destroy him; he would either a) kill Scott Baldwin for his part and be sent to jail for murder and she would never see him again or b) he would want to kill Scott and he would feel so guilty and heartbroken that he was the one who caused Laura's catatonia telling her something so traumatic when it didn't even happen.
Lesley attended Lucky and Elizabeth's second marriage in March, where she was also introduced to Spinelli when he interrupted the ceremony when the minister asked "if anyone knew whey they should not be joined . . ." Spinelli only stood up because it looked like Lulu was about to tell everyone that Elizabeth's baby was really Jason's and not Lucky's. Spinelli recovered and the marriage took place.
Lesley returned to the front-burner temporarily on October 30, 2008 when Scott kidnapped Laura and took her to Los Angeles. She assisted Lucky, Lulu, and Nikolas in finding her location. Laura is eventually found and is leaving Port Charles for Paris to seek further treatment. Not known to anyone at first, Laura is followed by Scott.
Lesley attended Lucky and Elizabeth's engagement party in October 2009 and then disappeared off-screen. She stayed for a while with Laura in Paris, where she became aware that her daughter and Scott got closer again. Not liking Laura and Scott's new found friendship, Lesley joins Nikolas at Lake Como in Italy.
2013—.
As of March 2013, Lesley is said to be staying at Nikolas' house in Italy and is taking care of his son Spencer. A couple of weeks later, Lesley returns to Port Charles with Spencer to reunite him with his father. She is surprised to learn of Laura's plans to remarry Scott. Lesley disapproves of Laura's plans and confronts Scott with the murder of her husband, Rick Webber. Laura pleads with Lesley and hopes that she forgive Scott's past mistakes. Scott promises Lesley that he cares for Laura and wants only what's best for her. Not wanting to stay in their way, Lesley gives them her blessing even though she's not happy about it. After Mayor Lomax is unable to perform Laura and Scott's wedding, Lesley jumps in as she's able to officiate the ceremony. At the wedding, Lesley also reunites with her granddaughter Lulu who was recently kidnapped by Stavros Cassadine and since then can't remember her previous life. Lesley becomes aware of Nikolas' interest in Elizabeth, who's attending the ceremony with Monica's son AJ. Later on, Lesley put on a doctor's jacket for the first time in almost 30 years when she pretended to still be a doctor in order to gain information on Luke's medical condition, but ended up being confronted by old rival Monica. After exchanging barbs, Monica allowed Lesley to get the information she was seeking when Lesley pleaded to Monica's motherly instincts. After coming back from escorting Laura to France, Lesley decided to remain in town. On Halloween night, Lesley passed out when she opened the Wyndemere door to find Faison standing there. Later on, old rival Monica was invited over for an off-screen visit with Lesley which included old hospital pals Gail Baldwin and Audrey Hardy where Lesley gave Monica a gift of a painting which unbeknownst to them was painted by Heather!

Colon Street

Colon Street is a crowded street in downtown Cebu City that is often called the oldest and the shortest national road in the Philippines. It is named after Christopher Columbus. It traces its origins to the town plan by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the Spanish conquistador who arrived in the Philippines to establish a colony in 1565.
Colon, a bit run-down now, was the site of fashionable shops, offices and movie houses. It was once the heart of Cebu City's shopping and business activity, but in recent years (specifically during the early 1990s), much of this activity has shifted inland to the more modern, bigger and diverse commercial and business districts now spread in almost all of the urban areas of the city in what used to be considered residential and leisure settlements.
In 2006, the Cebu City Council proposed a plan to close parts of Colon street from vehicular traffic and convert it to a tourism zone. However, this was met with much opposition from businessmen and motorists due to concerns regarding security and parking spaces.

<doc id="9905022" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9905022" title="Qirad">
Qirad

The qirad was one of the basic financial instruments of the medieval Islamic world. It was an arrangement between one or more investors and an agent where the investors entrusted capital to an agent who then traded with it in hopes of making profit. Both parties then received a previously settled portion of the profit, though the agent was not liable for any losses.
Origins and history.
Although the qirad is never mentioned in the Qur'an, many Islamic traditions attribute its origin to the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. These traditions describe Muhammad and his companions either using the qirad or endorsing the institution Many will notice that the qirad is almost identical to the institution of the commenda later used in western Europe, though whether the qirad transformed into the commenda, or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.
Legal technicalities.
Though there existed several different major schools of Islamic law, the basic legalities of the qirad were rather uniform throughout the schools.
Dinars and dirhams, as well as gold, silver, and copper coins in circulation were allowed to be invested. However, goods such as barley were restricted from the qirad because the possible fluctuations in their value in the free market. 
The agent was allowed to take the investment and split up his investments in any way, as well as invest in anything he wanted, except in cases where stocks are plentiful and not seasonally bound. It was also permissible for an investor to forbid the agent from buying certain kinds of goods. Many of the third parties involved in the qirad were actually unaware of their involvement which allowed the agent to trade freely and without liability.
Although the fractional split in profit was agreed on beforehand, the investor could not stipulate a specific sum of the money from the profit, or that a certain profit be made. In this way, the qirad remained a complete risk on the investor and did not infringe on the free market economy., It was however possible to make a deal on the split of the profit beforehand by stipulating a specific percentage. This could be either a low or a high percentage.
The principal investement can not be paid back, either by the investor ending the agreement, or the agent ending the agreement, if the principal is still invested in goods. The goods must be sold before the principal can be handed back, and the profits split. On the other hand, the investor is allowed to buy goods from the agent if he does not connect any conditions to this transaction.
The agent can also ask the help of a servant of the investor, but this servant also has to share in the profit and can not be asked to do any other work than work connected to the investment. A servant can also invest in the same investment as his master and also shares in the profit.
If the agent has to hire help for a job, the wage for this person can be paid from the principal, except if the wage should result in loss for the investor, the agent himself is responsible for whatever is not covered by the principal.
The agent can use the principal for food and clothes if he should travel for his business, and the principal is large enough to allow it. If he stays at home this is not allowed.
An agent can invest the money of an investor, the agent then becomes an investor himself, but he is then liable for the losses of the second agent. If the principal decreases, the original investor is allowed to ask the original agent to cover the loss.

Wallis–Zieff–Goldblatt syndrome

Wallis–Zieff–Goldblatt syndrome is a rare condition characterized by inherited skeletal disorders manifested mainly as rhizomelic short stature and lateral clavicular defects. It is also known as Cleidorhizomelic syndrome.
Clinical presentation.
An initial clinical report of this syndrome describes a 6-month-old boy with rhizomelic shortening, particularly in the arms, and protuberances over the lateral aspects of the clavicles. On radiographs the lateral third of the clavicles had a bifid appearance resulting from an abnormal process or protuberance arising from the fusion center. His 22-year-old mother also had a height of 142 cm with an arm span of 136 cm and rhizomelic shortness of the limbs, maximal in the arms, and abnormalities of the acromioclavicular joints. Both the mother and the son had marked bilateral clinodactyly of the fifth fingers associated with hypoplastic middle phalanx.

Joe Lucadello

Joseph P. Lucadello (also known as Ike Rosen) is a fictional character in Mark Winegardner's novels "The Godfather Returns" and "The Godfather's Revenge". Both novels are based on the original novel "The Godfather" by Mario Puzo.
"The Godfather Returns" introduces Lucadello as an informant to the Corleone family and a CIA agent who originally enlists in the Canadian Air Force under Billy Bishop in 1941. Before this, he served in the Civilian Conservation Corps with Michael Corleone. Fearing Benito Mussolini's rise to power, the two falsify pilot's licenses to join Bishop, but Michael's father Vito Corleone tips Bishop off, and Michael admits the truth to avoid damaging Lucadello's chances. During World War II, Lucadello loses an eye, afterward wearing an eye patch and, later, a glass prosthetic. After the war, he leaves the Air Force and becomes a CIA agent. He eventually becomes the main assistant of the CIA director, Albert Soffet.
Around this time, he begins informing the Corleone family of the CIA's plans to confront organized crime. Lucadello meets with Michael Corleone several times, although these meetings are not specifically for business. The novel characterizes Lucadello as the closest thing Michael has to a friend; nevertheless, Michael does not fully trust him.
In "The Godfather Returns", Lucadello is assigned to oversee a failed plot to assassinate Fidel Castro in 1959. In 1962, after a Castro body double is killed, he is assigned to eliminate the assassin, Carmine Marino.
In "The Godfather Returns", Lucadello informs main antagonist Nick Geraci, a former Corleone family "caporegime" who seeks to dethrone Michael as head of the family, that Michael is planning to assassinate him. Michael never discovers who betrayed him, and despite the fierce attempt to locate Geraci, he never finds him. At the end of the novel, Lucadello is found dead with an icepick penetrating his only eye.

WKRU

WKRU (106.7 FM) is an adult album alternative-formatted radio station licensed to Allouez, Wisconsin and serving the Green Bay area. The station is owned by Cumulus Media.
History.
The station began broadcasts in December 1996, when Jack LeDuc resurrected the WJLW call letters and its country music format one year after selling its previous home at 95.9 FM. LeDuc ran WJLW until March 1998, when he decided to sell a second time. The new owners, Cumulus Media, changed the station to "106.7 The Eagle," airing a classic rock format. By the mid 2000's, some current rock songs would be inserted into the format, with the station billing themselves as "The Rock of Green Bay."
Major changes would occur at the station in March 2007, as Cumulus changed the call letters to WZNN and dismissed the on-air staff. "The Eagle" ended on the night of March 5 when, after an hour of music from The Eagles (ending with "Hotel California"), the station stunted[http://www.wisconsinbroadcasting.com/Format%20Change%20Files/WZNN%20Starts%20Stunting.mp3] with construction site noise. At precisely 1:06PM the next day (March 6), WZNN relaunched as "106-7 The Zone," with Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and Green Day's "Holiday" being the first 2 songs played. In billing themselves as "Green Bay's only true alternative", WZNN's move was aimed to set the station apart from the traditional mainstream/classic rock stations in the area. "The Zone" would also air the syndicated "Mancow's Morning Madhouse" program during morning drive time.
On December 9, 2010, WZNN changed its call sign to WKRU, rebranded as "Kruz @ 106.7," and adapted a new adult album alternative format, a format similar to that on stations in Madison (WMMM-FM) and Chicago (WXRT-FM).

Prolyl endopeptidase

Prolyl endopeptidase (PE) also known as prolyl oligopeptidase or post-proline cleaving enzyme is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the "PREP" gene.
Function.
Prolyl endopeptidase is a large cytosolic enzyme that belongs to a distinct class of serine peptidases. It was first described in the cytosol of rabbit brain as an oligopeptidase, which degrades the nonapeptide bradykinin at the Pro-Phe bond. The enzyme is involved in the maturation and degradation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides such as alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone, angiotensin, neurotensin, oxytocin, substance P and vasopressin. PREP cleaves peptide bonds at the C-terminal side of proline residues. Its activity is confined to action on oligopeptides of less than 10 kD and it has an absolute requirement for the trans-configuration of the peptide bond preceding proline.
Prolyl endopeptidases are involved in the maturation and degradation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides.
Structure.
Prolyl endopeptidase is a cytosolic prolyl endopeptidase that cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of prolyl residues within peptides that are up to approximately 30 amino acids long. Only short protein residues are able to enter the active site of prolyl endopeptidase due to the distinct beta-propeller region that acts as a gating filter mechanism.
Clinical significance.
Altered PREP activity may be associated with autism spectrum disorders and various psychological diseases such as schizophrenia, mania and clinical depression.
However, there is conflicting information as to the exact role that prolyl endopeptidase plays in the pathophysiology of depression, with earlier studies documenting a "decreased" activity of the enzyme in depressed patients, but more recent studies demonstrating that "inhibition" of the same enzyme actually results in alleviation of depressive symptoms.
Some types of prolyl endopeptidase have been used in studies to decrease the propensity of gluten-containing wheat products to aggravate coeliac disease. However, orally administered enzymes are potentially subject to inactivation in the gastrointestinal tract.
Inhibitors.
Several prolyl endopeptidase inhibitors are known, and have been suggested as possible nootropic and antidepressant drugs. Notable compounds include

Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors

In Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., 32 N.J. 358, 161 A.2d 69 (N.J. 1960), the New Jersey Supreme Court held that an automobile manufacturer's attempt to use an express warranty that disclaimed an implied warranty of merchantability was invalid.
Facts.
On May 7, 1955, Mr. Claus H. Henningsen purchased a Plymouth automobile, manufactured by Chrysler Corporation, from Bloomfield Motors, Inc. The automobile was intended as a Mother's Day gift to his wife, Helen, and the purchase was executed solely by Mr. Henningsen.
The contract for sale was a one-page form and contained paragraphs in various type sizes on the front and back of the form. Mr. Henningsen testified he did not read all paragraphs of the contract. The back of the contract contained the following clause:
The manufacturer warrants each new motor vehicle (including original equipment placed thereon by the manufacturer except tires), chassis or parts manufactured by it to be free from defects in material or workmanship under normal use and service. Its obligation under this warranty being limited to making good at its factory any part or parts thereof which shall, within ninety (90) days after delivery of such vehicle To the original purchaser or before such vehicle has been driven 4,000 miles, whichever event shall first occur, be returned to it with transportation charges prepaid and which its examination shall disclose to its satisfaction to have been thus defective; This warranty being expressly in lieu of all other warranties expressed or implied, and all other obligations or liabilities on its part, and it neither assumes nor authorizes any other person to assume for it any other liability in connection with the sale of its vehicles.
The car was delivered on May 9, 1955. There were no problems with the car until May 19, 1955. On that day, Mrs. Henningsen was driving the car at 20-22 mi/h on a smooth two lane highway. Mrs. Henningsen then heard a loud noise, the steering wheel spun in her hands, and the car suddenly veered and collided with a wall. The car was damaged severely, and declared totaled by the Henningsens' insurance carrier.
The defendants refused to repair the car under warranty since they claimed the express warranty was limited only to repairing the defective parts and that it was not liable for damages caused by defective parts.
Procedure.
Mr. and Mrs. Henningsen sued under a theory of negligence and a theory of warranty. The court felt the proof was not sufficient to make out a "prima facie" case of negligence and gave the case to the jury solely on the warranty theory. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, Mr. and Mrs. Henningsen, against both defendants. The appellate case was argued on December 7, 1959 and was decided on May 9, 1960.
Holding.
Automobile purchasers may recover for damages caused by defective parts under an implied warranty of merchantability since automobile manufacturers and dealers may not limit this warranty to replacement of only defective parts as this violates fair dealing and public policy.
Reasoning.
Automobiles were sold by the automobile manufacturer to the automobile dealer, who in turn sells them to consumers. Therefore, there is no privity between the automobile manufacturer and the consumer. While a majority of courts, at this time, hold privity is required for the manufacturer to be liable to the consumer, there is a trend towards eliminating privity as a requirement. It is unjust for the manufacturer to benefit from advertising their product as suitable as a car and profit from this representation, while providing a basic implied warranty that what they are providing matches what they represent they are providing. Therefore, an implied warranty accompanies every car the manufacturer puts into the stream of trade.
The express warranty signed by Mr. Henningsen will apply under contract law even if he did not read all of it. The warranty agreement, which is a standard used by all major automobile manufacturers, seems to disguise the limitations of the warranty coverage. The jury verdict at trial established this disclaimer was not fairly obtained, and, therefore, the disclaimer will not apply to the situation at hand. Therefore, damages under implied warranty will stand.
Further, the contract is one of adhesion and Mr. Henningsen had no chance to bargain on its terms. The defendants took advantage of their relative bargaining power to force unfair disclaimers upon the customer, and since this disclaimer of any warranty except one for replacement of defective parts violates public policy.
Commentary.
Some law and economics scholars have criticized this result as it will ultimately raise prices as automobile manufacturers and dealers have to pay for implied warranty costs. This results in an economically inefficient transaction since not all consumers wanted this warranty, but now all consumers are forced to pay for it.
New Jersey courts, attorneys and scholars frequently cite "Henningsen" as the landmark case that established strict liability for defective products in the United States. However, the majority of US courts, attorneys, and law professors usually cite "Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co." and the Supreme Court of California as the source of the doctrine.

Quarter tone clarinet

A quarter tone clarinet is an experimental clarinet designed to play music using quarter tone intervals.
Around 1900, Dr. Richard H. Stein, a Berlin musicologist made the first quarter-tone clarinet, which was soon abandoned. 
Using special fingerings, quarter tones may be produced by a skilled player on a conventional clarinet. However, such fingerings are awkward in rapid passages, and results tend to vary from one clarinet to another. In the 1920s Alois Hába commissioned a quarter tone clarinet from the Kohlert copmany of Grazlitz. At some point, another German, the instrument builder Fritz Schüller (1883-1977) of Markneukirchen made an attempt to create a quarter tone clarinet to overcome these problems. It consisted of a single mouthpiece connected to two parallel bores, one slightly longer than the other; effectively these were two clarinets tuned a quarter tone apart. A single set of keywork controlled the tone holes of both bores simultaneously, and a valve was provided to switch rapidly from one bore to the other.
Music for quarter tone clarinet has been written by Eric Mandat, Alois Hába (Sonata and "Matka"), Viktor Ullmann, and by some various jazz musicians through the late 20th century. Other composers, such as Bela Bartok and Pierre Boulez, wrote for conventional clarinet using quarter tones.

Doomsday + 1

Doomsday + 1 was an American post-apocalyptic comic-book series published by Charlton Comics in the 1970s.
It is best known as the first original, color-comics series by artist John Byrne, who would go on to become a major industry figure. Byrne had previously drawn three unrelated, anthological short stories for comics, as well as the first three issues of a Saturday-morning cartoon licensed comic book before co-creating this original series.
Publication history.
"Doomsday + 1" originally ran six issues, cover-dated July 1975 - May 1976. Two years after its cancelation it was revived as an all-reprint series with issues #7-12 (June 1978 - May 1979), reprinting the contents of the first six issues.
The series was created by writer Joe Gill and penciler-inker John Byrne for the small, Derby, Connecticut-based publisher Charlton Comics, under editor George Wildman. Byrne, who also served as letterer, used the pseudonym "Byrne Robotics" for issue #4-6 (reprinted as #10-12). The credits for issue #5 credit the artwork as "Art: Byrne Robotics with technical assistance from Patterson-75", a pseudonym for Bruce Patterson, who provided some degree of inking.
Byrne drew the covers of issues #2-6, with the cover of issue #1 variously credited to Byrne and to Tom Sutton. Issues #7 and #11 featured re-colored reprints of Byrne covers, while issues #8-10 and #12 featured "new" covers created by blowing up panels of interior artwork from the stories.
Stories ran 22 to 23 pages, with most issues also containing a two-page text backup — either a story featuring the main characters or a non-fiction featurette. The backup in issue #5 consisted of two comics pages, drawn by Steve Ditko, of "real world" paranormal vignettes.
One additional 22-page story was produced by Gill and Byrne, but was not published in the original series. It appeared in two parts titled "There Will Be Time, Part One: Time-Slip" and "Part Two: The Man from Elsewhen" in publisher CPL/Gang Publications' Charlton-sponsored comic-book/fanzine hybrid "Charlton Bullseye" #4-5 (April & Sept. 1976).
Sales of the 1978-79 reprint issues began strong, and editor Wildman assigned Tom Sutton to write and draw a 15-page story scheduled to run as issue #13. As sales of the reprint series tapered off, the project was canceled. While the script became lost, Sutton's pencil-and-ink art for the story, "The Secret City," eventually surfaced, with the cover and the first page published in the magazine "Charlton Spotlight" #6 (Fall 2008).
Later reprints.
All six original stories plus the two-part "Charlton Bullseye" story were reprinted as the Fantagraphics comic-book series "The Doomsday Squad" #1-7 (Aug. 1986 - June 1987), with new covers by Byrne (#1-2), Neal Adams (#4), and Gil Kane (the remainder). This series included a new backup feature each issue, including "Dalgoda" by writer Jan Strnad and artist Dennis Fujitake, "Keif Llama" by writer-artist Matt Howarth, and "Captain Jack" by writer Mike Kazaleh and artist Marc Schirmeister.
Fictional character biographies.
The series takes place in a near future in which a South American despot named Rykos launches his sole two atomic missiles on New York City in the U.S. and Moscow in the U.S.S.R. The two superpowers, each believing the other has launched a first strike, retaliate. By the time American president Cole and a Russian premier with the first name Mikhail have realized their errors, their fully automated nuclear-missile systems can not be countermanded.
Only hours before the apocalypse begins, a Saturn VI rocket launches bearing three astronauts: Captain Boyd Ellis, United States Air Force; his fiancée, Jill Malden; and Japanese physicist Ikei Yashida. Weeks later, after the post-apocalyptic radiation has subsided to safe levels, their space capsule lands upon a melting Greenland ice field, where the three ally themselves with Kuno, a 3rd-century Goth revived from his ice-encased suspended animation.
The four encounter a Russian scientist/cyborg in Canada, where they commandeer a futuristic jet plane; undersea dwellers; and brutish U.S. military survivors, among others.

Johannes Agricola in Meditation

"Johannes Agricola in Meditation" (1836) is an early dramatic monologue by Robert Browning. The poem was first published in the "Monthly Repository"; later, it appeared in "Dramatic Lyrics" (1842) paired with "Porphyria's Lover" under the title "Madhouse Cells."
Agricola's "meditations" serve primarily as a critique of antinomianism. The speaker believes in an extreme form of predestination, claiming that, since he's one of the elect, he can commit any sin without forfeiting his afterlife in heaven.
Poem Text.
There's heaven above, and night by night <br>
I look right through its gorgeous roof;<br>
No suns and moons though e'er so bright<br>
Avail to stop me; splendour-proof<br>
I keep the broods of stars aloof:<br>
For I intend to get to God,<br>
For 't is to God I speed so fast,<br>
For in God's breast, my own abode,<br>
Those shoals of dazzling glory, passed,<br>
I lay my spirit down at last.<br>
I lie where I have always lain,<br>
God smiles as he has always smiled;<br>
Ere suns and moons could wax and wane,<br>
Ere stars were thundergirt, or piled<br>
The heavens, God thought on me his child;<br>
Ordained a life for me, arrayed<br>
Its circumstances every one<br>
To the minutest; ay, God said<br>
This head this hand should rest upon<br>
Thus, ere he fashioned star or sun.<br>
And having thus created me,<br>
Thus rooted me, he bade me grow,<br>
Guiltless for ever, like a tree<br>
That buds and blooms, nor seeks to know<br>
The law by which it prospers so:<br>
But sure that thought and word and deed<br>
All go to swell his love for me,<br>
Me, made because that love had need <br>
Of something irreversibly <br>
Pledged solely its content to be.<br>
Yes, yes, a tree which much ascend,<br>
No poison-gourd foredoomed to stoop!<br>
I have God's warrant, could I blend<br>
All hideous sins, as in a cup,<br>
To drink the mingled venoms up;<br>
Secure my nature will convert <br>
The draught to blossoming gladness fast:<br>
While sweet dews turn to the gourd's hurt,<br>
And bloat, and while they bloat it, blast,<br>
As from the first its lot was cast.<br>
For as I lie, smiled on, full-fed<br>
By unexhausted power to bless,<br>
I gaze below on hell's fierce bed,<br>
And those its waves of flame oppress,<br>
Swarming in ghastly wretchedness;<br>
Whose life on earth aspired to be<br>
One altar-smoke, so pure! -- to win<br>
If not love like God's love for me,<br>
At least to keep his anger in;<br>
And all their striving turned to sin.<br>
Priest, doctor, hermit, monk grown white<br>
With prayer, the broken-hearted nun,<br>
The martyr, the wan acolyte,<br>
The incense-swinging child, -- undone<br>
Before God fashioned star or sun!<br>
God, whom I praise; how could I praise,<br>
If such as I might understand,<br>
Make out and reckon on his ways,<br>
And bargain for his love, and stand,<br>
Paying a price at his right hand?'

Joan Arend Kickbush

Joan Arend Kickbush (March 23, 1926 – June 16, 2006) was a popular Alaskan artist. Her paintings and illustrations featured Alaska Native children, Yupik villagers and Arctic wildlife. She painted in watercolor and oil.
Personal life.
Joan developed an interest in drawing as a small girl. Joan Arend married Roland Gene Kickbush, who was nicknamed "Kick". In 1953 Kickbush and her husband Roland moved to Anchorage, Alaska where they both worked as a teachers and Kickbush painted. They built their first home in 1960 in Anchorage.
By 1978 Kickbush and her husband left Alaska to live in the Lower 48 states. They lived in Bend, Oregon; California and Carefree, Arizona. 
She died on June 16, 2006. Roland died in California on June 25, 2009. In 1965 it was reported that the couple had no children, and there were no children mentioned in Roland's obituary.
Career.
Before moving to Anchorage in 1953, she was a commercial artist in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Hawaii. Once she settled in Anchorage, however, there was little opportunity for a commercial artist. She was a kindergarten teacher when she took an Alaskan teacher's tour to Kotzebue and Nome in 1955. From that time, she embarked on what became a career painting Alaska Native (Inupiat–Yupik) children. Her paintings of the "wide-eyed" children were popular, and journalist Phyllis Eilleen Lancaster stated that: "Her style is realistic, with the charm and appeal of Hummel figurines."
At an exhibit in 1963 at the Alaska Art Gallery, 40 of her watercolors and oils of native children were shown. It was her first Interior Alaska art showing. Shed exhibited her work at the House of Wood, a local gallery in Fairbanks.
The couple purchased a plane that Roland piloted so that they could travel to remote villages in Alaska. She made paintings in her studio of scenes she had sketched during their visits, and he matted and framed her works. The Siberian Yupik village of Savoonga on St. Lawrence Island was her favorite subject. At a United Nations tea in Anchorage in or before 1965, Hubert Humphrey's wife, Muriel Buck Humphrey, was given one of Kickbush's works. The Alaska Crippled Children's Association gifted a painting to the head chaplain and it hung in his Washington D.C. office. The University of Wisconsin had her works in a permanent collection.
An exhibition of her watercolor and oils was held at the Alaska Art Gallery in Fairbanks from November 18 to December 2, 1966.
The Frye Art Museum in Seattle held an exhibition of Kickbush's works in November, 1977. It featured her paintings of Alaska Native children. At that time she and her husband were living in Bend, Oregon, and she made paintings from sketches she had previously made during visits to Alaskan villages. Her trademark technique was to "transfer the sketches to pressed board and after applying oils, uses a palette knife technique to produce a jewel-like finish;" Her oils obtained a matte finish through the use of artists' wax. During her career as a commercial artist she cleaned many brushes, so when she began working on her own she preferred the palette knife and only used a brush to sign a painting.
Kickbush wrote and illustrated several coloring books that were popular with Alaska Natives because the images were so lifelike. She illustrated a textbook, "This is Alaska," and created a line of stationery and Christmas cards. Kickbush worked in pastels, ink, charcoal and watercolors.
Works.
Paintings.
Her works have been held in collections from Alaska to Washington, D.C. and in Europe and Japan. Just a few of her works are:

Davis redshirted in 1991 and would await the graduation of star quarterback Shawn Jones through his redshirt freshman and sophomore seasons. Bobby Ross would leave before Davis's sophomore season and Bill Lewis was appointed head coach. The team, 2 years removed from a National Title, only won five games and finished the 1992 season with a 5-6 record.
Davis in 1993 was looked upon as a new hope for the Georgia Tech faithful. His redshirt sophomore campaign began with a thrashing of Furman but over the next three games Georgia Tech would be outscored 102-27. Davis would finish the year with a 5-6 record and a loss to archrival Georgia.
Bill Lewis wanted a spark for his wilting team so he recruited junior college transfer Tom Luginbill from Palomar. Luginbill came in from a wide open pass offense where he tossed for over 7,600 yards and had won 21 games in two years. Luginbill would eventually take the starting job from Davis after Davis got injured in spring practice. Donnie was a favorite amongst the team on and off the field, which further compounded the issue. Several Georgia Tech players saw Luginbill's appointment as an insult to their former coach and national title team.
Luginbill's first two efforts in 1994 saw Georgia Tech narrowly lose to then #1 Arizona and demolish Western Carolina. Then, the team began a downward spiral as death threats against Luginbill and racial divide may have split the team into small quarreling factions. Luginbill's career ended at Georgia Tech with a 1-10 record and the firing of Coach Bill Lewis. Lewis was replaced by defensive coordinator George O'Leary.
After Luginbill transferred to Eastern Kentucky, Davis and O'Leary began a major rebuilding of the Georgia Tech football program that would lead Georgia Tech eventually back to playing in bowls and competing at the highest level in the ACC. Davis over his career compiled an 11-11 record with over 4,000 yards of total offense and 29 total touchdowns. He is remembered for his athleticism and steadfast nature during some of the darkest times in Georgia Tech football.
Professional career.
Davis would go on to be one of the most successful passers in Arizona Rattler history. He would win the Most Valuable Player of Arena Bowl XI in 1997, where Kurt Warner was the opposing quarterback.
After football.
Donnie retired from arena football in 2001 and has worked in the mortgage banking industry ever since. Davis plans on graduating from Georgia Tech in 2009 with a Bachelor of Science in Management.
He is currently an intern at both the Southern Company and for the Georgia Tech department of athletics, and has also started a LinkedIn group for Georgia Tech football letter winners

Rodney Smith (Buddhist)

Rodney Smith (born c.1947) was a hospice caregiver for a number of years, and is an author and the guiding teacher of the Seattle Insight Meditation Society, an organization he founded in 1993.
Biography.
Smith was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan and drafted during the Vietnam War, serving in Belgium as a medic. He returned home and became a social worker, when one evening he attended a lecture by Ram Dass in Cincinnati, Ohio that made him inspect his life more deeply—becoming a vegetarian and doing meditation. In 1976 he joined the Insight Meditation Society (IMS) in Massachusetts as a long term yogi and later joined staff and performed menial jobs as a cook and janitor. While at IMS he developed a desire to go deeper into his vipassana practice, and in 1979 met the Burmese Theravada monk Mahasi Sayadaw. He chose to return with Sayadaw to Burma and was there ordained as a Theravada Buddhist monk—studying in Thailand as a monk for an additional four years. He then decided to return to lay life, sensing that the monastic life was not his particular calling. While in Thailand he read the book ""Who Dies?"" by Stephen Levine and decided he would like to work with the dying. He returned to IMS and met up again with Ram Dass, who helped him get to work at a hospice located in Houston, Texas. He served in hospice settings for 17 years, and in 1993 he founded the Seattle Insight Meditation Society—where he is now a full-time Dharma teacher. He is the author of Lesson from the Dying and Stepping out of Self-Deception (Shambhala 2010).

Nasrat Sharqi

Nasrat Sharqi () is a Demographics of Afghanistan singer from Afghanistan.
Discography.
Nasrat Sharqi was one of the most influential Afghan artists in America throughout the 1980s and 90's. 
His music career started at a young age. He attended lycee Istiqlal in Kabul and he attended the Musical academy in Kabul with peers such as Said Omar and Ehsan Aman. He later travelled to Ankara Turkey to study at the University of Ankara. 
In the late 1980s circa 1989, Nasrat Sharqi was the first Afghan musician to introduce the one-man-band to the Afghan community in the USA. With his keen talents and technological savvy he programmed a yamaha workstation keyboard with Afghani taals, better known as rhythms. As time went on newer technology and the introduction of MIDI, he introduced yet another instrument which is still used by Afghan singers today; the Roland R8 drum machine. This drum machine along with its Ethnic Tabla card increased the precision and audio visualization of a full Afghan band controlled by one man. He was also responsible for introducing the Technics line of keyboards to the Afghan music scene. He quickly became the most popular Afghan singer in America. Constantly performing at events in California, Texas, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and many other states including Canada. His love and devotion to music led him to create dozens of songs which remain hits till this day. Songs such as Gadi wan, Jaan-0-Jaanan em Naroo, Ay Dilbaram, and many others. 
Nasrat Sharqi was a singer who sang with a unique and soft melodious voice. His ability to maintain a note for very long periods of time was a testament to his superb talent and practice. He also mastered the art of moving smoothly and powerfully from a low note and octave quickly to a very high note and octave. This style was unique to only one other Afghan singer and that is the legendary Ahmad Zahir. He was also known for being the king of rhythms. He had a great amount of knowledge with percussion instruments. Therefore his beats were programmed very realistically and attractively to the listener. 
The demand for his music was very high and at times impossible to satisfy. His productive and generous career abruptly came to a stop in late summer of 1994 when he arrived home from a multi-state tour. He complained of pains in his chest and soon after collapsed and had a devastating stroke. His heart gave up on him and paramedics quickly arrived to perform cpr. They managed to get his heart pumping again and he went to the hospital. He remained in a coma for three months. His elder mother sat by his bedside along with his best friend/brother Siddiq Alim. After waking up from his coma Nasrat Sharqi suffered from serious brain damage. A few days after leaving the hospital he got dizzy and collapsed hitting his head on the pavement. This led him to go back to the hospital again. This accident resulted in a blood clot in his brain and destroyed his short term memory capabilities and affected his basic motor skills. It seems as though he tried too hard to satisfy his people. He dedicated his life to sharing his golden voice and musical talents with his people. He went nights and nights without sleep and constantly traveled by car, gig after gig, state after state, night after night. In the end this took a huge toll on his body. 
Today Nasrat Sharqi is alive, contrary to rumors floating around that his stroke was tragic. He currently lives with his elder and sweet mother in Arlington, Virginia. He is but a memory of the musical legend and icon that so many Afghans grew up listening to in the 80's and 90's. He is currently too sick to play keyboard anymore or sing. Unfortunately the brain damage he suffered is permanent and there is very little hope of him making a full recovery.

Flight medic

A flight medic is a paramedic that functions in an aeromedical environment. Typically the flight medic will work with a registered nurse, physician, Respiratory Therapist, or another paramedic. The flight paramedic is usually highly trained and has years of clinical experience in a high acuity environment. Flight paramedics usually are either certified as a FP-C or a CCEMT-P. Most hold certificates as instructors in various fields and educational topics.
Programs.
Currently, of the air medical programs 85-87% utilize flight paramedics. Typically, flight paramedics have five or more years of experience working in a critical care and 911 system environment. All require critical thinking skills and need to act as part of the team on the aircraft.
How to become a flight Medic.
You must first become certified and trained as a ground paramedic. It is important to continue your education and take as many additional training certification courses as possible. In most hospitals 80% of calls received by flight medics are critical care transports, so the more the experience you have the better your application will look. Depending on where you apply, most hospitals and/or health care facilitates look for flight medics who have at least 2-5 years of experience on the ground truck (Ambulance).
Training and Certifications.
Flight Paramedic Certification, Critical care certification, critical care paramedic certification, pre-hospital trauma life support, CPR training (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation), Advanced cardiac life support certification, and paddle training. Also hospitals look only for the best and most educated paramedics, and that only comes from years of education and experience. In addition to the training and experience you have acquired as a ground paramedic, hospitals and health care facilities also look for paramedics who can think quickly on their feet, challenge their physicians and nurses diagnosis when they believe it is wrong, consistently show a desire for continued education and put their patients safety and health as their top priority.
Responsibilities of a Flight Medic.
Flight medics work with a mobile response unit outside of the hospital setting. They provide on-site emergency medical care to patients suffering from severe injury, trauma, or sickness. They are responsible for diagnosing their patients conditions and are responsible for proving proper medical support to aid to the recovery and/or stabilization of their patients injury while transporting them to a qualified health care facility.
Critical Medical Assessments.
As a flight medic, you may come into situations where you have to assess your patient. Some Critical medical assessments include: Spinal Injuries, Bone fractures, 1st 2nd and 3rd degree burns, cardiac arrest, obstetrics, airway management, blood circulation management, and wound management. These are only a few, there are many more. Also as a flight medic you will be trained to work the following devices and tools: Defibrillators, heart monitors, cardiac monitors, balloon pumps, IV drips, medical kits, inflatable splints, airway management devices and tools, stretchers and boards, wheelchairs and medication delivery devices.

<doc id="9905395" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9905395" title="G-index">
G-index

The "g"-index is an index for quantifying scientific productivity based on publication record. It was suggested in 2006 by Leo Egghe.
The index is calculated based on the distribution of citations received by a given researcher's publications:
Just as with the h-index, the g-index is a number which is the same for two different quantities:
g is (1) the number of highly cited articles, such that each of them has brought (2) on average g citations.
This is in fact a rewriting of the definition
as
In other words, this means that in order to have a g-index of n an author that produces n articles should have, on average, n citations for each of them. Unlike the h-index, the g-index depends on the full citation count of very highly cited papers. Roughly, "h" is the number of papers of a quality threshold that rises as h rises; "g" allows citations from higher-cited papers to be used to bolster lower-cited papers in meeting this threshold. Therefore, in all cases g is at least h, and is in most cases higher. However, unlike the h-index, the g-index saturates whenever the average number of citations for all published papers exceeds the total number of published papers; the way it is defined, the g-index is not adapted to this situation.
The g-index has been characterized in terms of three natural axioms by Woeginger (2008). The simplest of these three axioms states that by moving citations from weaker articles to stronger articles, one's research index should not decrease. Like the h-index, the g-index is a natural number and thus lacks in discriminatory power. Therefore, Tol (2008) proposed a rational generalisation. 
Tol also proposed a collective g-index.

Daniel Devlin

Daniel Joseph Devlin (1814 – February 22, 1867) was a prosperous businessman, City Chamberlain, and prominent citizen of New York City. 
Devlin was born at Buncrana, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1814. As a young merchant tailor, he emigrated to America in 1833. Three younger brothers later joined him in America; two sisters, and a brother, Phillip Devlin, who became a Catholic priest, remained in Ireland. Daniel Devlin moved to Louisville, Kentucky, and is believed to have worked for a time as a steamboat clerk on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, which led him to encourage his brother William Devlin to establish himself in Louisiana. Devlin founded a jeans manufacturing company in Louisville, and later moved to New York City, where he and two of his brothers established a clothing company, Devlin Brothers. Daniel Devlin was named City Chamberlain of New York in 1861, and remained in that position until his death. 
After the outbreak of the American Civil War, he headed the executive committee charged with recruitment and financing for the Irish Brigade of the Union Army. In politics, he was a Democrat, and played a prominent role in the New York State Democratic convention in 1864. He was a director of the Union Trust Company of New York, and a prominent Catholic layman who in 1863 helped found the Society for the Protection of Destitute Roman Catholic Children in the City of New York and in 1864 established a scholarship at St. Francis Xavier College. 
Devlin died in New York on February 22, 1867. His brothers donated a stained glass window in his memory to St. Patrick's Cathedral, where it can be seen today.

Zonulin

Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the wall of the digestive tract. Initially discovered in 2000 as the target of zonula occludens toxin, secreted by cholera pathogen "Vibrio cholerae", it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease and diabetes mellitus type 1. 
Gliadin (glycoprotein present in wheat) activates zonulin signaling irrespective of the genetic expression of autoimmunity, leading to increased intestinal permeability to macromolecules. ALBA Therapeutics is developing a zonulin receptor antagonist, Larazotide acetate (formerly known as AT-1001), that successfully passed phase 2b clinical trials.
Zonula occludens toxin is being studied as an adjuvant to improve absorption of drugs and vaccines.

Seville (band)

Seville is a rock group formed in the winter of 2001, by Mike Marsh of the Agency and Dan Bonebrake of The Vacant Andys, joined the now-well-known Dashboard Confessional. They disbanded in 2003, with all members following other projects.
History.
Both The Agency and The Vacant Andys were South Florida favorites that ran out of steam around the time that Dashboard Confessional gained all its momentum. Now that Mike and Dan were in a band together, they realized a certain chemistry that they thought would work in a different type of band than Dashboard, so they formed Seville with ex-Vacant Andy John Owens and ex-Agency Chris Drueke.
Seville quickly recorded the first 6-song e.p. "Waiting In Seville" for Fiddler Records and jumped on the road opening for Dashboard. By the end of 2001, Seville had already toured with Ben Kweller, Sense Field, Duvall, Further Seems Forever, Ultimate Fakebook, Midtown, and Rival Schools. After that tour, Mike realized his place was with Dashboard Confessional, while Dan stuck with Seville. Chris now took on the bulk of the singing duties, and they recruited Kris King (Against All Authority/Machete) on drums. This line-up recorded four songs for a split release with Duvall and subsequent tour in the summer of 2002.
Midway through the tour all the members of Seville realized that the personality conflicts and the chemistry without Mike was just not enough to keep going. The band parted ways on the second night of tour with Schatzi. In the van ride home, the guys gave Chris Drueke their blessings to continue with Seville should he so desire. Chris Drueke then recorded what was intended to be a solo CD entitled "Take Me Home." Through some prodding from friends, family, and the record label, the CD was released under the name Seville in early 2003. Though Drueke released a live recording of an acoustic performance under the name Seville, the band's life was practically over.
Current projects.
Mike Marsh and Chris Drueke have since reunited with Klaus Ketelhohn to revive The Agency. The new CD from the Agency entitled "Turn" will be released February 6 on Perch/Eulogy. Dan Bonebrake is currently playing with Vagrant Record's John Ralston, and John Owens is playing with ex-Vacant Andy Darryl Bonebrake in Band No. 12.

Drug corridor is the name given to various paths in the U.S., generally being coterminal with major highways and interstates, that are major highways for the flow of illicit drugs into, out of, and across the U.S. There is no definitive drug corridor, as many people claim that their city lies in a drug corridor (just as many people claim that their city is the "meth capital of the world"). Many sources, however, corroborate that the main arteries of drug flow are East-West across the U.S., North from Mexico, and South from Canada. Most of the marijuana and cocaine imported into the U.S. flows from Latin America across the U.S.-Mexican border, while many imported synthetic drugs and former designer drugs flow south from Canada.
Trans-American Corridor.
Inhabitants of the lower Midwest and South, including Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and the Carolinas, generally dub their locales to be part of the main trans-American drug corridor, as well as those of the Southwestern U.S. states such as Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.

Wubi (Ubuntu installer)

Wubi ("Windows-based Ubuntu Installer") is an official Windows-based free software installer for Ubuntu, which installs the software on an existing Windows partition, thus without need for partitioning.
Wubi was born as an independent project and as such versions 7.04 and 7.10 were unofficial releases. Since 8.04 the code has been merged within Ubuntu and since 8.04 alpha 5, Wubi can also be found in the Ubuntu Live CD. It was removed in 13.04.
The project's aim is to enable existing Windows users, unacquainted with Linux, to try Ubuntu without risking any data loss (due to disk formatting or partitioning mistakes). It can also safely uninstall Ubuntu from within Windows.
It is not a virtual machine, but creates a stand-alone installation within a loopmounted device, also known as a disk image, like Topologilinux does. It is not a Linux distribution of its own, but rather an installer for Ubuntu.
While Wubi does not install Ubuntu directly to its own partition this can also be accomplished by using LVPM, the Loopmounted Virtual Partition Manager, to transfer the Wubi-generated Ubuntu installation to a dedicated real partition, including a bootable USB keydrive. The advantage of this setup is that users can test the operating system and install the drivers before they install it to a dedicated partition (and avoid booting and functioning risks).
Wubi adds an entry to the Windows boot menu which allows the user to run Linux. Ubuntu is installed within a file in the Windows file system (c:\ubuntu\disks\root.disk), as opposed to being installed within its own partition. This file is seen by Linux as a real hard disk. Wubi also creates a swap file in the Windows file system (c:\ubuntu\disks\swap.disk), in addition to the memory of the host machine. This file is seen by Ubuntu as additional RAM.
A related project, Lubi, uses Linux as the host system instead of Windows. However, this project has not been worked on since 2007 and only works on Ubuntu 7.04.
Desktops.
Users can select the desktop environment within Wubi. But, because each desktop environment is also available as an application package, it is recommended that users install Ubuntu (default option) and from there install the other desktop environments. When users log in, they can choose the desktop environment to use.
Limitations.
Compared with a regular installation, a Wubi installation faces some limitations. Hibernation is not supported and the filesystem is more vulnerable to hard reboots. Also, if the Windows drive is unmounted uncleanly (Windows crash, power failure, etc.), Ubuntu will not be able to repair, re-mount, and boot from the Windows NTFS drive until Microsoft Windows has successfully booted, repaired the drive, and then shut down cleanly. If the Windows system could not be booted after the corruption to repair the filesystem, the user would also not be able to boot Ubuntu.
Performance related to hard-disk access is also slightly slower on a Wubi install, more so if the underlying disk image file is fragmented, as the disk image file in the Windows filesystem contains a Linux filesystem whereas without Wubi only the Linux filesystem is used that has direct hardware access.
Wubi creates the root.disk file using Microsoft's proprietary NTFS file system while running under the MS Windows OS and then while the Ubuntu OS is running it accesses that file using an alternative file system driver. The differences between the Microsoft and Linux implementations of NTFS could technically result in corruption of the root.disk file that affects the NTFS filesystem in such a way that it could even prevent Windows from booting. Running "chkdsk /r" from MS Windows to fix the damaged NTFS file system and then shutting down Windows cleanly may fix any corruptions (this may take a significant amount of time to run as root.disk is a large file).
Influences.
Wubi relies on other open source projects: Debian installer, Migration Assistant, Grub4Dos, NTFS-3G, NSIS and Metalink.
Development.
The lead developers are Agostino Russo, Geza Kovacs, Oliver Mattos and Ecology2007. The main development occurs at Launchpad and is led by the Lupin Team (Lupin is the loop-installer, handles everything that happens after reboot) through the original Ubuntu blueprint page and the new Wubi, Lubi, Lupin, and LVPM project pages.
Hardware support.
Both the i386 (32-bit x86) and x86-64 releases of Ubuntu are supported by Wubi and Lubi, although this was a recent change. In versions before 8.04, only the x86 release of Ubuntu was supported.
History.
A number of Linux distributions, including Red Hat Linux and Slackware's ZipSlack, provided a similar tool in the mid 1990s, using syslinux and the UMSDOS filesystem driver. Later, SuSE provided something similar using syslinux and loop-mounted disk images on FAT filesystems. During the late '90s BeOS used a similar system to install the OS in a folder in Windows.
The idea for Wubi was drafted by Agostino Russo taking inspiration from Topologilinux, which provided a loopmounted installation, and Instlux, that provided a simple Windows frontend. The idea was to merge the two concepts having a Windows installer that would loopmount an image of Ubuntu. Geza Kovacs later refined the specification and provided the first prototypes to show that the concept was sound. Oliver Mattos wrote the original user interface in NSIS.
Agostino Russo then refined the loop-installation concept, moving from a simple loopmounted pre-made image file to an image created on the fly using a dynamically patched version of the Debian installer, thus providing an experience which was closer to a real installation while addressing several other issues of the early prototypes. Lupin project was thus born and Agostino Russo wrote and implemented most of its code with some contributions from Geza Kovacs.
Agostino Russo and Ecology2007 later redesigned and rewrote the current Windows front-end. Hampus Wessman contributed the new downloader and the translation scripts. Bean123 and Tinybit also helped to debug and fix bootloader issues. Lubi and LVPM were subsequently created by Geza Kovacs.
The project has inspired the creation of other Windows-based Linux installers, such as Win32-loader.

Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu

The Church of Saint Peter in Gallicantu is a Roman Catholic church located on the eastern slope of Mount Zion, just outside the Old (walled) City of Jerusalem.
History.
The church takes its name from the Latin word "Gallicantu", meaning cock's-crow. This is in commemoration of Peter's triple rejection of Jesus ""... before the cock crows twice."" ()
A Byzantine shrine dedicated to Peter's repentance was erected on this spot in 457 AD, but was destroyed by the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1010. The chapel was rebuilt by Crusaders in 1102 and given its present name. After the fall of Jerusalem the church again fell into ruin and was not rebuilt until 1931. Today a golden rooster protrudes prominently from the sanctuary roof in honor of its biblical connection. This spot is also believed to be the location of the High Priest Caiaphas' palace. According to the Pilgrim of Bordeaux in his Itinerarium Burdigalense, "...going up from the Pool of Siloe to Mount Zion one would come across the House of the Priest Caiaphas."
Layout and Design.
Entrance and Sanctuary.
The entrance to the church is from a parking lot which is located above the main level of the church. In the courtyard is a statue that depicts the events of the denial and include its main figures; the cock, the woman, and the Roman soldier. The inscription includes the biblical passage; "But he denied him, saying "Woman, I know him not"!" () The entrance itself is flanked by wrought iron doors covered with biblical bas reliefs. To the right are two Byzantine-era mosaics found during excavation, these were most likely part of the floor of the fifth-century shrine. The main sanctuary contains large, multi-colored mosaics portraying figures from the New Testament. Facing the entrance is a bound Jesus being questioned at Caiaphas' palace; on the right Jesus and the disciples are shown dining at the Last Supper; and on the left Peter, considered the first Pope, is pictured in ancient papal dress. Perhaps the most striking feature of the interior is the ceiling, which is dominated by a huge cross-shaped window designed in a variety of colors. The fourteen Stations of the Cross also line the walls and are marked with simple crosses.
Lower Church and Crypts.
Beneath the upper church is a chapel which incorporates stone from ancient grottos inside its walls. Down a hole in the center of the sanctuary one can see caves that may have been part of the Byzantine shrine. These walls are engraved with crosses left by fifth-century Christians. On an even lower level there is a succession of caves from the Second Temple period. Since tradition places the palace of Caiaphas on this site, many believe that Jesus may have been imprisoned in one of these underground crypts after his arrest, however, these underground caves were normal in many Roman-era homes, and often served as cellars, water cisterns, and baths. On the north side of the church is an ancient staircase that leads down towards the Kidron Valley. This may have been a passage from the upper city to the lower city during the first temple period. Many Christians believe that Jesus followed this path down to Gethsemane the night of his arrest.
Oversight.
Much of the writing in the church is in French. This is because the church belongs to the Assumptionist Fathers, a French order established in 1887 and named for Mary's Assumption into heaven. The Order has its headquarters in Jerusalem's monumental Hostelry of Our Lady of France, (Notre Dame de France), built in 1889.

Chocolate box art

Chocolate box art originally referred literally to decorations on chocolate boxes. Over the years the terminology has developed and is now applied broadly as a descriptive, but often pejorative, term to describe paintings and designs that are warm, idealistic and sentimental.
Using his own paintings of children, flowers and holiday scenes Richard Cadbury, the son of the founder of Cadbury's, introduced such designs to his chocolate boxes in the late 19th century.
Renoir's paintings have been described as "chocolate box" and have been derided by the likes of Degas and Picasso for being happy, inoffensive scenes. Constable's landscapes have also been so described.
Aelbert Cuyp's "" (1660), despite being widely regarded as his best work, has been criticised as having "chocolate box blandness". Fred Swan is a modern day proponent of chocolate box paintings as, to his detractors, was Thomas Kinkade.
The term has also been applied to sculpture. A young couple standing locked in an embrace forms the centrepiece for the new £800m St Pancras International station in central London. Entitled "The Meeting Place", the £1m sculpture is by Briton Paul Day who admitted, "Some will say it is a chocolate box sculpture".

Park City High School

Park City High School is a public high school in the state of Utah, USA. It is located at 1750 Kearns Blvd in Park City, Utah. It is one of eight public schools in the Park City School District and serves tenth, eleventh, and twelfth graders. Academically, it is ranked the number one high school in the state of Utah, and in 2011, it was ranked one of the top 200 high schools in the United States by Newsweek magazine.
History.
Park City High School was established in 1928 and was originally located at 1255 Park Avenue in Park City, UT. It was constructed in February 1928 at a cost of $200,000 (about $2.5 million today) and was a modified Collegiate Gothic style brick building with three levels. The building was abandoned in 1981, when a new high school was constructed on Kearns Blvd, about a mile away. The old building has since been restored and is now used as the Park City Library and the Jim Santy auditorium, which hosts the annual Sundance Film Festival and the Park City Film Series. The Kearns Blvd. building was a modern-style brick building until 2008, when the building underwent a significant renovation designed by the Salt Lake City based architectural firm VCBO. The current high school stands on a site of 35 acres and consists of three levels.
Academics.
Recognition.
Park City High School is well recognized for its achievement in academics. It is the current holder of the Utah State A.P. Award, making it the number one high school in the state of Utah on the basis of student involvement in Advanced Placement (A.P.) courses. Over 23 A.P. classes are offered at Park City High School. It is ranked the number one high school in the state of Utah by KSL Schools, a division of the Bonneville International corporation. In 2011, Park City High School was named one of the best 200 high schools in the United States by "The Daily Beast", a website published by Newsweek Magazine, placing it in the top .008% of all high schools in the country.
Electronic Integration.
In 2012, Park City High School adopted a one-to-one personal computer program wherein each student receives a Macbook Air. Teachers and students use a common learning management system called Canvas for information and assignments. Canvas is provided by Instructure, a Utah-based software company. Each student's personal computer has school-wide internet access. The current model issued to students is the 11-inch Apple Macbook Air. Students are allowed to take their laptops home, but are limited to websites and applications pre-approved by the administration.
Building.
Park City High School is a multi-level contemporary style complex. Since its renovation in 2008, the school has over 260,000 square feet of total floor area. The primary areas that underwent renovation were those on the front facade of the building facing Kearns Blvd, which included the school lunchroom, the main classroom wings, and the administrative offices. The reconstruction resulted in improvements such as a more spacious floor plan and updated building specifications. Updates to the building included redesigned classrooms with large glass windows and integrated multimedia systems, as well as a redesigned lunchroom area, which features five new food outlets, a school store, and a casual eating and socializing area for students. Other general updates to the building include new materials and finishes like glass, tile, stone, metal, and carpets. The combination of these materials, according to VCBO, "results in the entire complex appearing as one cohesive facility." The building now has a Silver Rating by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards. It has won four awards for its design, including the 2010 Outstanding Project Award for Green School Building Design by Leading By Design.

Ajat

Ajat () is a commune in the Dordogne department in Aquitaine in southwestern France.
History and geography.
The village of Ajat, set on a hill rising agricultural fields and woodland, is built around the historically important church, the Eglise Saint Martin which dates from the 12th century. François de Hautefort is buried there. The castle dates to the fifteenth century (with part from the fourteenth) and was once connected to the church via a wooden bridge. A coat of arms of the Hautefort barony is visible.
In a document dating from 1158 (the Cartulaire Cadouin) the name 'Abzacum' is mentioned for the first time, describing a farm dating back to the Gallo-Roman era. A Roman road linking Vesunna (Périgueux) and Lugdunum (Lyon) ran by or close to the town. In the Middle Ages, the name became 'Abzac', one of the oldest family names in Périgord. The town was on a secondary route for pilgrims following the Way of St. James to Santiago de Compostela, and a house dating to 1527 was a relay point. In the thirteenth century Ajat's church was occupied by the Knights Templar, before the order was disbanded. By the 16th century Ajat was under the control of the Hautefort barony, based in a town to the east.
The Ajat commune has limestone woodland classified in the French system as being of special scientific interest (SSSI). The town has a public swimming pool in the summer months, and there is an occasional restaurant in the grounds of the castle. A small shop has now closed. Surrounding hamlets include Beauzens and Les Fouilloux, the latter consisting of only six dwellings. The commune of Beauzens joined Ajat in the late 1700s. The Church of St. Bartholomew in Beauzens (Eglise Saint-Barthélemy de Beauzens) dates to 1000, making it one of the oldest in the region. It has a Romanesque facade.
Although the commune has seen little population increase, there is some new building and in recent years there has been some refurbishment of older properties for use as second homes and tourist stays. The nearest town with shopping and public facilities is Thenon.
Population.
Residents are known as Ajacois. Ajat is home to the French artist Jeylina Ever.

Millennium Square (Sheffield)

Millennium Square is a modern city square in Sheffield, England. It was created as part of the Heart of the City project that began in 1998 and has become a central feature in Sheffield’s redeveloped city centre. It contains fountains in the shape of steel spheres, recalling Sheffield's past as a centre of the steel making industry, whilst linking with the fountains of the Peace Gardens, as well as Sheaf Square, Hallam Square and Barkers Pool. The square forms part of the 'Gold Route', designed by Sheffield City Council to guide visitors through the city centre from Sheffield Station to Devonshire Green.
Part of the space now part of the square was previously occupied by the Town Hall Extension. This building, constructed in the 1970s, was demolished in the early 2000s to make way for the wave of new developments in the Heart of the City project. 
The Square, which is in fact triangular, was designed by Architects Allies and Morrison and is surrounded by new developments on three sides and the redeveloped Peace Gardens on the remaining side. The surface of the square is made up of a suspended concrete slab covered with granite and sandstone paving. The surface is covered with hundreds of LED lights which are used to illuminate both square itself and the steel water features throughout it.
The square is intended to form a link between the Winter and Peace Gardens and also the St Paul’s Place development, which is home to Sheffield’s tallest building. 
The square is surrounded in all sides by new or renovated structures, with the Peace Gardens and Town Hall on one side and a multitude of new buildings on the three remaining sides.
Water features.
The steel balls in the square, of which are there are nine, are water features that were subject of a design competition held in 2003. The winner, artist Colin Rose, designed the feature in order to symbolise the steel, craftsmanship, stonework and water which are symbolic of Sheffield’s industrial heritage. The Piece is called ‘Rain’ and is designed to evoke the falling of rain drops upon the ground, with the small pools at the base of each steel ball creating the ripple effect.

301st Fighter Wing

The 301st Fighter Wing (301 FW) is an Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the United States Air Force. It is assigned to the Tenth Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, stationed at Carswell Field, Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas. If mobilized, the Wing is gained by the Air Combat Command.
Mission.
The mission of the unit is to maintain a state of readiness to deploy people and their assigned fighter aircraft (the F-16) wherever needed when notified of recall to active duty. Wing people assigned to the 301st Fighter Wing repeatedly demonstrate their flying expertise and professionalism in Air Combat Command, Air Force Reserve Command and NATO exercises designed to emphasize that to retain the country’s combat ready posture it must train as it plans to fight.
The wing comes under 10th Air Force, one of the three numbered Air Forces of the Air Force Reserve. If mobilized, the wing would come under Air Combat Command’s 12th Air Force.
Day-to-day activities of the wing are managed by full-time air reserve technicians and department of the Air Force civilians. Ready reservist assigned to the wing are required to attend unit training assemblies which are scheduled for one weekend each month, plus serve 15 days active duty each year to fulfill their reserve commitment. Since reserve pilots are required to maintain the same degree of readiness as their active duty counterparts, flying activities are scheduled Tuesday through Saturday of each week throughout the year.
The 301st Fighter Wing Commander is Brigadier General Ronald B. Miller.
Units.
Wing attached units
History.
The unit's origins begin during World War II, when it was part of Twentieth Air Force. The 301st Fighter Wing's P-47N aircraft flew very long range (VLR) escort missions of B-29 Superfortress bombardment groups against Japan.
World War II.
The 301st Fighter Wing was organized in the United States under First Air Force, initially at Seymour-Johnson Field, North Carolina in October 1944, then moved to Mitchel Field on Long Island in November. On Long Island, the wing coordinated the delivery of the very long range Republic P-47N Thunderbolt from its manufacturing plant at Farmingdale, with aircraft being flown to North Carolina where two of the newly assigned groups of the 301st (413th and 414th) were training.
The war in the Pacific required fighter ranges even greater than did operations over Germany, and the mission of the 301st Fighter Wing was to provide bomber escort for Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortress bombers during their strategic bombing missions over Japan in 1945.
Soon after Saipan and Guam were taken with B-29 units being assigned there, the 318th Group formed on the Ryukyu Islands, consisting of six fighter groups, the 15th and 21st (being transferred from Seventh Air Force) and the 413th, 414th, 506th and 507th, all being deployed from the United States. Being the first wing to be equipped with the P-47N, the groups operated as a long-range escort for B-29 Superfortress bombers attacking the Japanese mainland all the way from Saipan to Japan and on many other long, overwater flights.
In July 1945 the 301st was reassigned to the Eighth Air Force with the same mission for Eighth Air Force in the planned invasion of Japan. The atomic bombings of Japan led to the Japanese surrender before Eighth Air Force saw action in the Pacific theater.
The wing was reassigned to Far East Air Forces when Eighth Air Force was returned to the United States in 1946. Its four wartime fighter groups returned to the United States early in 1946, being replaced by the 51st Fighter Group as its operational unit. It served as part of the Army of Occupation on Okinawa. The wing performed air defense role over the Ryukyu Islands. After 18 August 1948, the wing had no units assigned and existed as a paper unituntil inactivated on 20 January 1949.
Cold War.
The 301st was reactivated in July 1972 as the 301st Tactical Fighter Wing at Carswell AFB, Texas in the United States Air Force Reserve. Upon reactivation the wing was assigned the Republic F-105 "Thunderchief", with the Carswell based 457th Fighter Squadron using specially modified version of the F-105D called the "Thunderstick II". The 301st Fighter Wing led the way for Air Force Reserve fighter units in deploying to overseas bases for NATO exercises when it deployed to Norvenich Air Base, Germany, in August 1977 and Gioia del Colle Air Base, Italy, in May 1979.
In 1981, the wing converted to the McDonnell-Douglas F-4D Phantom II. Subsequent overseas deployments by the 301st Fighter Wing included Cigli Air Base, Turkey, in October 1982. A deployment to Sivrihisar Air Base, Turkey, in May 1985 was an AFRES first when they operated under bare base conditions. The unit also deployed to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station in Puerto Rico, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. In 1987 the unit began swapping to the newer F-4E Phantom II. During Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, many wing people were recalled to active duty and served at various locations throughout the United States, Germany, England, and Southwest Asia.
In April 1991, the wing converted to the F-16C/D, "Fighting Falcon".
Modern era.
In December 1993, the wing deployed six F-16s, (along with six from the 944th Fighter Wing at Luke AFB, Arizona), and approximately 350 wing people to Aviano Air Base, Italy, in support of United Nations Operation Deny Flight mission. Due to the wing converting from the F-4 to the F-16 fighter aircraft during Desert Shield/Storm, this voluntary deployment to Aviano AB was the first non-exercise operational aviation deployment since flying fighters out of Carswell in 1972. Due to achieving the highest rating possible from the May 1994 Operational Readiness Inspection and supporting the Deny Flight mission, the 301st Fighter Wing was awarded as an Air Force outstanding unit for the period May 1992 to May 1994.
In May and June 1997, the wing deployed to Karup Air Station, Denmark. The wing joined forces with three US Air Force units and foreign militaries in two separate exercises while in Denmark. The first was a command and control exercise, called Central Enterprise. The second exercise was called BALTOPS, short for Baltic Operations.
In May 1998, the wing deployed with six Air Force Reserve aircraft in support United Nations Southern Watch mission in Ahmed Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait.
Global War on Terrorism.
Elements of the 301st Fighter Wing deployed in October 2001 to the Middle East as part of a regularly scheduled aerospace expeditionary force rotation to enforce the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. While there, the reservists also began flying combat missions as part of Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF) over Afghanistan. Throughout the 90-day deployment, the reservists flew between nine and 15 hours a day.
In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Hill AFB. It would distribute nine of the 419th Fighter Wing F-16s to the 301st Fighter Wing. In 2007 the wing gained another eight aircraft from the 192d Fighter Wing of the Virginia Air National Guard bringing its total to 32 airplanes.

Formally, the regions of the Extreme North comprise the whole of Yakutia, Magadan Oblast, Kamchatka Oblast and Murmansk Oblast, as well as certain parts and cities of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Komi Republic, Tyumen Oblast, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Irkutsk Oblast, Sakhalin Oblast, Khabarovsk Krai, as well as all islands of the Arctic Ocean, its seas, the Bering Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk.
Some other territories of Russia with harsh climate are defined to be "equated to the conditions of Extreme North", in terms of labor compensation.
Largest cities.
Murmansk (pop. 302 468), Yakutsk (286 456), Norilsk (175,365), Novy Urengoi (116 450) and Magadan (95 048) are the largest cities within the Russian Far North proper, while larger and southerner Arkhangelsk (350 985) is the largest among cities and territories "equated" to the Far North.
Legal status.
The Far North is known for its extremely harsh climate. People who work there, other than indigenous populations involved in traditional occupations and inmates of labor camps ("e.g.", gulag of the Soviet Union), used to receive an extra grade of payment, referred to as the "Northern Bonus", as well as other benefits, including extra vacation, extra disability benefits, extra retirement benefits, and housing benefits.
In January 2007 the State Duma Committee for Issues of North and Far East approved the proposed law "On the List of the Regions of the Extreme North and Territories Equated to It" («О перечне районов Крайнего Севера и приравненных к ним местностей») as part of the package of laws on the labor compensation, including «О государственных гарантиях и компенсациях для лиц, работающих и проживающих в районах Крайнего Севера и приравненных к ним местностях» ("On government guarantees and compensation for persons working and residing in the regions of the Far North and equivalent areas"), «О районировании Севера РФ» ("On regional delineation of the North of the RF") as well as a law on the corresponding amendments to the Russian Labor Code. According to the List, the Extreme North territories will be subdivided into two categories: "zone of extreme discomfort" and "zone of absolute discomfort".

Terminal Station (Atlanta)

Terminal Station in Atlanta was the larger of two principal train stations in downtown, Union Station being the other. Opening in 1905, Terminal Station served Southern Railway, Seaboard Air Line, Central of Georgia (including the "Nancy Hanks" to Savannah), and the Atlanta and West Point. The architect was P. Thornton Marye, whose firm also designed the Fox Theater and Capital City Club in downtown Atlanta, as well as the
Birmingham Terminal Station.
At the station's opening in 1905 the military band of the 16th Infantry Regiment played "Down in Dixie" according to a report that appeared in the "Atlanta Journal".
In its 20th century heyday, Atlanta Terminal Station was used by such well-known trains of the time as the "Crescent", "Man 'o War", "Nancy Hanks", "Ponce de Leon", and "Silver Comet". A veritable rail-travel crossroads of the American south-east, it was a critical railroad link between the warm climate of Florida and the Gulf Coast, and the rather colder, more densely populated states of the north-east and mid-west. For many northern Americans, Atlanta Terminal was the gateway to the sunshine. The Atlanta Convention Bureau released a postcard in the 1920s that claimed that Terminal Station was served by 86 trains per day.
The train shed that had originally been built alongside the head house was torn down in 1925. The Southern Railway built an office building next door to the station at 99 Spring Street that is still standing, although the Southern eventually moved their local offices to another building in Atlanta. On 17 May 1938 a five-story Terminal Hotel, that had been built across the street from Terminal Station, burned in a disaster that claimed 27 lives. The station head house was renovated in 1947 just after World War II.
After Terminal Station closed in June 1970, the Southern Railway continued to operate the Southern Crescent passenger train, shifting its Atlanta stop to the much smaller Peachtree Station, commonly known as Brookwood Station (although Amtrak was created in 1971, the Southern Railway did not join until February 1979). Terminal Station was razed in 1972, although Southern retained one platform for its use. The site of Terminal Station is now the Richard B. Russell Federal Building which was built in 1979.
The aforementioned platform, an old switch tower, and a portion of lead trackage are all that remain of the station.

Children's Court Clinic

The Children's Court Clinic is a government body in New South Wales, a state of Australia, which prepares independent reports on children in Children's Court of New South Wales proceedings.
Constitution.
The clinic is established under the Children's Court Act 1987 (NSW) and its function is further specified according to sections 52-59 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998. As of 1 July 2011 the Minister for Health is required to establish the clinic in accordance with the Children's Court Rule 2000 (NSW).
An assessment report by the clinic is taken to be an independent report to the court rather than evidence tendered by a party (section 59, the Care and Protection Act). The Children’s Court Clinic Authorised Clinician who prepares a report is nevertheless available to the court for cross-examination. 
Under the court's rules, the clinic is composed of the Director of the Children’s Court Clinic and any other persons appointed by the Attorney General. Those other persons are persons considered by the Attorney General to be suitable to prepare and submit assessment reports for the court. This is in the process of changing as the clinic is gradually transferred to the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network.
The clinic currently employs a team of senior psychologists based in Parramatta and Broadmeadow NSW to do its work. It also has a list of Authorised Clinicians who perform work on a contractual basis. They are experienced clinicians in psychiatry, psychology or social work.
Jurisdiction.
The clinic is required to make clinical assessments of children and families in care matters and report to the children's court on those assessments. The report is given to the court ordering the assessment, which then determines whether to release it to the parties in the case.
Location.
The clinic is located at 
2 George St 
Parramatta and 19-23 Lambton Rd Broadmeadow

Jim Houston

James Edward "Jim" Houston (born November 3, 1937) is a former American football linebacker who played thirteen seasons in the National Football League with the Cleveland Browns. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006.
College career.
Houston played for the Ohio State Buckeyes as an end. He was a three-year starter under head coach Woody Hayes and twice the team MVP. He was elected the team captain as a senior. 
Houston contributed on both offense and defense. Although known primarily for his excellent blocking and tackling, he was also the leading receiver on the 1959 team, including a 100-yard game that year against Michigan State. He was an All-America selection in 1958 and 1959.
Houston was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame in 1979, and was named to the Ohio State Football All-Century Team as a defensive end in 2000.
Pro career.
Houston was chosen in the first round of both the AFL draft by the Buffalo Bills and the NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns. Like his older brother Lin Houston, Jim chose the Browns. He originally played as a defensive end under head coach Paul Brown, but later moved to linebacker under Blanton Collier. At linebacker he became a four-time Pro Bowl selection. In the 1969 NFC Conference Championship game against the Minnesota Vikings, Jim went to tackle Viking quarterback Joe Kapp low and Kapp tried to hurdle him. Kapp's knee hit Jim in the side of the head, knocking him out and breaking his jaw.

Alexander Soloviev (Александр Соловьёв), (1846, Luga – May 28, 1879), was a former student who unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Tsar Alexander II of Russia with a revolver.
On the morning of April 20, 1879, Alexander II was briskly walking towards the Square of the Guards Staff and faced Soloviev. Having seen a menacing revolver in his hands, the Tsar fled. Soloviev fired five times but missed, and was sentenced to death.
Soloviev was hanged on May 28, 1879 (in Julian calendar; June 9, 1879 in Gregorian calendar).
Soloviev had acted on his own, but other revolutionaries were keen to murder Alexander, and there were several assassination attempts following this.

Indiewood

Indiewood is the alternate pathway to creating films other than the Hollywood Studio System. Many exceptional filmmakers have found creative freedom in their work by creating films outside the Hollywood Major Studio System. 
Differences from Hollywood.
The films are often made for far less money, and with less of a committee to confirm or deny each aspect of the filmmaking process. Additionally, in the post-production period of the film's life in Indiewood, the filmmaker can take as long as they need to finish their film - while in Hollywood they are contracted to finish the film in a specific period of time (usually 10 weeks). In Hollywood, the film then goes on to show in focus group screenings on the studio lot. In Indiewood, the filmmakers can determine the next steps of the film.
Most Indiewood films are first shown at film festivals with the hopes of further distribution by being picked up (or purchased) by a larger film company or distributor. 
Simultaneously, many Hollywood films do not make it past the focus groups and subsequent distribution because the scripts are often ruined by being over-thought and "over-written" by the executive committees & focus groups. Hollywood films are usually made for the lowest common denominator audience while Indiewood films are able to be released with a more singular vision of the film director (ideally).
In an issue devoted to digital filmmaking and technologies, Scientific American Magazine printed diagrams by director Tara Veneruso demonstrating the difference between Indiewood and Hollywood from pre-production through distribution. The diagrams include the theatrical move to satellite rather than film prints.

John Jermain

Major John Jermain (May 20, 1758 – February 17, 1819) served in the Westchester Militia during the American Revolution. A library in Sag Harbor, New York was built and named in his honor in 1910.
Biographical information.
Jermain was born in Westchester County, New York. He joined the Westchester Militia and fought in the American Revolution. Following the war, he moved to Sag Harbor and married Margaret Pierson of Bridgehampton, New York. Together, they had nine children. One of their daughters, Margaret Pierson Jermain, was the mother of Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage, who married Russell Sage, a financier and politician from New York. Major John Jermain died in 1819 in Sag Harbor.
Memorial library.
Margaret Sage organized the effort to fund and build the John Jermain Memorial Library in Sag Harbor in honor of her grandfather. The library was designed by Augustus N. Allen and presented as a gift to the people of Sag Harbor in 1910. The property was bought at a cost of $10,000, and was directly across from Mrs. Sage's then summer home on Main Street. At that time, it was the highest price ever paid for a piece of real estate in Sag Harbor.
In 1912, a deed of trust was executed by Mrs. Sage in which the library, its grounds and equipment were deeded to a body of trustees under the laws of New York State. The John Jermain Memorial Library was permanently endowed by Mrs. Sage that it might forever be secured to the people of Sag Harbor and vicinity. She became known as Sag Harbor's greatest benefactor, also providing the village with Pierson High School and Mashashimuet Park. In total, she gave Sag Harbor a total of between $300,000 and $400,000, just a small portion of the $23 million she gave to philanthropy in her lifetime.

Newford

Newford is a fictional North American city, the setting in many of Charles de Lint's works of urban fantasy. De Lint generally avoids writing about cities that he has not been to; however, his hometown of Ottawa did not afford him the necessary freedoms for certain stories, and he began to set them in an "unnamed" big city. After several such stories, he named the city and expanded his development of it.
Canadian readers tend to think of Newford as an American city, while Americans usually think of it as Canadian, as it incorporates elements of both. However, de Lint has stated that he chose to definitively give it the American legal system.

Boiling Point is a 1993 action-thriller film written and directed by James B. Harris, and starring Wesley Snipes, Dennis Hopper, Lolita Davidovich, Viggo Mortensen and Dan Hedaya.
Plot.
This film opens with police officer Jimmy Mercer (Wesley Snipes) and his partner (Dan Hedaya) doing some undercover work, when Mercer's fellow agent is shot and killed by a new man, Ronnie (Viggo Mortensen) that criminal Red Diamond (Dennis Hopper) pulled out of jail. Now on a snap of anger and thoughts of revenge, Mercer wants to find the killer and take him down before he gets transferred to another precinct. Although a cop and close colleague claims over dinner that Mercer must do it "by the book," Mercer replies that "when I'm done with this motherfucker, I'm gonna put him in a box... by the book."
Red continues to try to build a relationship with one of his old girlfriends but fails. Through explosions and action, Mercer's temper rises with the suspense.

List of Japanese football champions

The Japanese football champions are the winners of the top league in Japan, the Japan Soccer League from 1965 to 1992 and the J. League since then.
Teams in bold have completed the double of the title and the Emperor's Cup in the same season. In 1985 no double was possible due to the season's timeframe change; thus, the doubles completed between then and 1992 are won in the middle of the season.
Japan Soccer League (1965–1971).
Numbers in parentheses indicate number of wins at the date. Leading goalscorer's nationality is at the time of award and does not necessarily indicate the national team played for.
J. League (1993–1998).
In 1992, professional J. League was established. All teams elected to it strip themselves of corporate identities and adopt their own names. From 1993 to 2005 (except for 1996 season) the league was contested in an Apertura and Clausura manner, thus the "runners-up" for these seasons are actually the winners of one of these tournaments which lost to the winners of the playoff. The "third places" are the highest-scoring teams in the aggregate table which were not involved in the playoff. If there was no playoff due to the champions winning both stages, the third place is the second-best points earning team who are not the champions.
J. League Division 1 (1999–present).
Top flight becomes J. League Division 1 in 1999.
Total wins.
Twelve clubs have been champions, though only nine have won the title since the establishment of J. League. Of these nine, Kashima Antlers, Gamba Osaka, and Nagoya Grampus have never been Japan Soccer League champions.
All Japanese champion clubs still exist and are competing in the J. League; however, some may have moved from their Japan Soccer League locations they won the title at, or may have cut off ties with their original parent company.
Years in "italic" indicate Japan Soccer League seasons. Clubs in bold compete in Division 1 as of the 2014 season; clubs in "italic" no longer exist.
Wins by region.
This is a breakdown by Japanese region, as clubs have moved cities before and even during the J. League period. Sanfrecce Hiroshima, Júbilo Iwata, Yokohama F. Marinos, Cerezo Osaka and Nagoya Grampus are the only champion clubs who have always been based in their respective cities.
Note that JFA divides Japan into nine regions opposing to more traditional eight, splitting Chūbu into Hokushin'etsu and Tōkai. See Japanese Regional Leagues for further detail.

On 14 September 2010, he shared a debate with the NF publicity officer, Tom Linden, on BBC Radio Foyle about the support the NF had in Coleraine to which John Dallat gave his disgust even though was criticised by Tom Linden for being a member of a sectarian party. This gave the NF a chance to air its views, which resulted with the NF Coleraine organiser, Mark Brown, "thanking" John Dallat for helping the NF double its support in Coleraine through enquiries and membership.
He is a member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul.
Dallat commented that Conor Murphy, MP MLA had scheduled 2016 opening of the Dungiven by-pass to coincide with the centenary of the Easter Rising, which caused an uproar from Sinn Féin. In a statement, Sinn Féin Colr. Paddy Butcher said: “Attacking Sinn Fin minister Conor Murphy, Mr. Dallat cautioned the residents of Dungiven to ‘hope the Dungiven bypass is less of an aspiration and more something they (Sinn Fin) are actually capable of delivering’.”

CD164

Sialomucin core protein 24 also known as endolyn or CD164 (cluster of differentiation 164) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "CD164" gene. CD164 functions as a cell adhesion molecule.
Sialomucins are a heterogeneous group of secreted or membrane-associated mucins that appear to play two key but opposing roles in vivo: first as cytoprotective or antiadhesive agents, and second as adhesion receptors. CD164 is a type I integral transmembrane sialomucin that functions as an adhesion receptor.

CD146

CD146 (cluster of differentiation 146) also known as the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) or cell surface glycoprotein MUC18, is a 113kDa cell adhesion molecule currently used as a marker for endothelial cell lineage. In humans, the CD146 protein is encoded by the "MCAM" gene.
Function.
Its function is still poorly understood, but evidence points to it being part of the endothelial junction associated with the actin cytoskeleton. A member of the Immunoglobulin superfamily, it consists of five Ig domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region. It is expressed on chicken embryonic spleen and thymus, activated human T cells, endothelial progenitors such as angioblasts and mesenchymal stem cells, and strongly expressed on blood vessel endothelium and smooth muscle. 
Two isoforms exist (MCAM long (MCAM-1), and MCAM short, or MCAM-s) which differ in the length of their cytoplasmic domain. Activation of these isoforms seems to produce functional differences as well. Natural killer cells transfected with MCAM-1 demonstrate decreased rolling velocity and increased cell adhesion to an endothelial cell monolayer and increased microvilli formation while cells transfected with MCAM-s showed no change in adhesion characteristics. Since these characteristics are important in leukocyte extravasation, MCAM-1 may be an important part of the inflammatory response. 
CD146 has been demonstrated to appear on a small subset of T and B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. The CD146+ T cells display an immunophenotype consistent with effector memory cells and have a distinct gene profile from the CD146- T cells.CD146 T cells have been shown by Dagur and colleagues to produce IL-17.
CD146 has been seen as a marker for mesenchymal stem cells isolated from multiple adult and fetal organs, and its expression may be linked to multipotency; mesenchymal stem cells with greater differentiation potential express higher levels of CD146 on the cell surface.
Clinical significance.
MCAM inhibits breast cancer progression.

CD24

Signal transducer CD24 also known as cluster of differentiation 24 or heat stable antigen CD24 (HSA) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "CD24" gene. CD24 is a cell adhesion molecule.
Function.
CD24 is a glycoprotein expressed at the surface of most B lymphocytes and differentiating neuroblasts. This gene encodes a sialoglycoprotein that is expressed on mature granulocytes and in many B cells. The encoded protein is anchored via a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) link to the cell surface. An alignment of this gene's sequence finds genomic locations with similarity on chromosomes 3p26, 15q21, 15q22, 20q11.2 and Yq11.1. Whether transcription, and corresponding translation, occurs at each of these other genomic locations needs to be experimentally determined (source: NCBI).

Black-collared lovebird

The Black-collared Lovebird ("Agapornis swindernianus") also known as Swindern's Lovebird is a small, 13.5 cm (5 in) long, African parrot in the genus "Agapornis". It is a mostly green parrot with black band on the back of its neck, and a dark greyish-black bill. Both sexes are similar. It is rarely kept in captivity because of its dietary requirement for a native fig.
Description.
It is a mostly green parrot with black-collared nape, brownish red chest, greyish black bill, yellow iris and grey feet. Both sexes are similar.
Taxonomy.
There are three subspecies of the Black-collared Lovebird:
The Black-collared Lovebird was discovered by Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. The name commemorates the Dutch professor, Theodore van Swinderen of University of Groningen.
Distribution and habitat.
The Black-collared Lovebird is distributed across a wide range in equatorial Africa. It inhabits the forests of Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Liberia and Uganda. They hide high in the forest canopy and are characterized as being very shy.
Status.
It is rare in some parts of its range. The range is so large that the population is difficult to estimate, but it is believed that the population is not under significant threat. The Black-collared Lovebird is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
Aviculture.
Black-collared Lovebirds are rarely kept in captivity or as pets. They require certain native fig seed or fig flesh as a basis of their daily diet, and without these vital dietary necessities they do not normally thrive or breed well in captivity.

Johann Sebastian Bach

[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Bach, aged 61, Haussmann, 1748
Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the Brandenburg concertos, the Mass in B minor, "The Well-Tempered Clavier", two Passions, keyboard works, and more than 300 cantatas, of which nearly 100 cantatas have been lost to posterity. His music is revered for its intellectual depth, technical command, and artistic beauty.
Bach was born in Eisenach, Saxe-Eisenach, into a great musical family; his father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, was the director of the town musicians, and all of his uncles were professional musicians. His father probably taught him to play violin and harpsichord, and his brother, Johann Christoph Bach, taught him the clavichord and exposed him to much contemporary music. Apparently at his own initiative, Bach attended St Michael's School in Lüneburg for two years. After graduating, he held several musical posts across Germany: he served as (director of music) to Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, Cantor of the in Leipzig, and Royal Court Composer to August III. Bach's health and vision declined in 1749, and he died on 28 July 1750. Modern historians believe that his death was caused by a combination of stroke and pneumonia.
Bach's abilities as an organist were highly respected throughout Europe during his lifetime, although he was not widely recognised as a great composer until a revival of interest and performances of his music in the first half of the nineteenth century. He is now generally regarded as one of the main composers of the Baroque period, and as one of the greatest composers of all time.
Life.
Childhood (1685–1703).
Johann Sebastian Bach was born in Eisenach, Saxe-Eisenach, on 21 March 1685 O.S. (31 March 1685 N.S.). He was the son of Johann Ambrosius Bach, the director of the town musicians, and Maria Elisabeth Lämmerhirt. He was the eighth child of Johann Ambrosius, (the eldest son in the family was 14 at the time of Bach's birth) who probably taught him violin and the basics of music theory. His uncles were all professional musicians, whose posts included church organists, court chamber musicians, and composers. One uncle, Johann Christoph Bach (1645–93), introduced him to the organ, and an older second cousin, Johann Ludwig Bach (1677–1731), was a well-known composer and violinist. Bach drafted a genealogy around 1735, titled "Origin of the musical Bach family".
Bach's mother died in 1694, and his father died eight months later. Bach, aged 10, moved in with his oldest brother, Johann Christoph Bach (1671–1721), the organist at St. Michael's Church in Ohrdruf, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. There he studied, performed, and copied music, including his own brother's, despite being forbidden to do so because scores were so valuable and private and blank ledger paper of that type was costly. He received valuable teaching from his brother, who instructed him on the clavichord. J.C. Bach exposed him to the works of great composers of the day, including South German composers such as Johann Pachelbel (under whom Johann Christoph had studied) and Johann Jakob Froberger; North German composers; Frenchmen, such as Jean-Baptiste Lully, Louis Marchand, Marin Marais; and the Italian clavierist Girolamo Frescobaldi. Also during this time, he was taught theology, Latin, Greek, French, and Italian at the local gymnasium.
At the age of 14, Bach, along with his older school friend George Erdmann, was awarded a choral scholarship to study at the prestigious St. Michael's School in Lüneburg in the Principality of Lüneburg. Although it is not known for certain, the trip was likely taken mostly on foot. His two years there were critical in exposing him to a wider facet of European culture. In addition to singing in the choir he played the School's three-manual organ and harpsichords. He came into contact with sons of noblemen from northern Germany sent to the highly selective school to prepare for careers in other disciplines.
While in Lüneburg, Bach had access to St. John's Church and possibly used the church's famous organ, built in 1549 by Jasper Johannsen, since it was played by his organ teacher Georg Böhm. Given his musical talent, Bach had significant contact with Böhm while a student in Lüneburg, and also took trips to nearby Hamburg where he observed "the great North German organist Johann Adam Reincken". Stauffer reports the discovery in 2005 of the organ tablatures that Bach wrote out when still in his teens of works by Reincken and Dieterich Buxtehude showing "a disciplined, methodical, well-trained teenager deeply committed to learning his craft".
Weimar, Arnstadt, and Mühlhausen (1703–08).
In January 1703, shortly after graduating from St. Michael's and being turned down for the post of organist at Sangerhausen, Bach was appointed court musician in the chapel of Duke Johann Ernst in Weimar. His role there is unclear, but likely included menial, non-musical duties. During his seven-month tenure at Weimar, his reputation as a keyboardist spread so much that he was invited to inspect the new organ, and give the inaugural recital, at St. Boniface's Church in Arnstadt, located about southwest of Weimar. In August 1703, he became the organist at St Boniface's, with light duties, a relatively generous salary, and a fine new organ tuned in the modern tempered system that allowed a wide range of keys to be used.
Despite strong family connections and a musically enthusiastic employer, tension built up between Bach and the authorities after several years in the post. Bach was dissatisfied with the standard of singers in the choir, while his employer was upset by his unauthorised absence from Arnstadt; Bach was gone for several months in 1705–06, to visit the great organist and composer Dieterich Buxtehude and his Abendmusiken at St. Mary's Church in the northern city of Lübeck. The visit to Buxtehude involved a journey on foot each way. The trip reinforced Buxtehude's style as a foundation for Bach's earlier works. Bach wanted to become amanuensis (assistant and successor) to Buxtehude, but did not want to marry his daughter, which was a condition for his appointment.
In 1706, Bach was offered a post as organist at St. Blasius's in Mühlhausen, which he took up the following year. It included significantly higher remuneration, improved conditions, and a better choir. Four months after arriving at Mühlhausen, Bach married Maria Barbara Bach, his second cousin. They had seven children, four of whom survived to adulthood, including Wilhelm Friedemann Bach and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach who both became important composers as well. Bach was able to convince the church and city government at Mühlhausen to fund an expensive renovation of the organ at St. Blasius's. Bach, in turn, wrote an elaborate, festive cantata—"" (BWV 71)—for the inauguration of the new council in 1708. The council paid handsomely for its publication, and it was a major success.
Return to Weimar (1708–17).
In 1708, Bach left Mühlhausen, returning to Weimar this time as organist and from 1714 "" (director of music) at the ducal court, where he had an opportunity to work with a large, well-funded contingent of professional musicians. Bach moved with his family into an apartment very close to the ducal palace. In the following year, their first child was born and Maria Barbara's elder, unmarried sister joined them. She remained to help run the household until her death in 1729.
Bach's time in Weimar was the start of a sustained period of composing keyboard and orchestral works. He attained the proficiency and confidence to extend the prevailing structures and to include influences from abroad. He learned to write dramatic openings and employ the dynamic motor-rhythms and harmonic schemes found in the music of Italians such as Vivaldi, Corelli, and Torelli. Bach absorbed these stylistic aspects in part by transcribing Vivaldi's string and wind concertos for harpsichord and organ; many of these transcribed works are still played in concert often. Bach was particularly attracted to the Italian style in which one or more solo instruments alternate section-by-section with the full orchestra throughout a movement.
In Weimar, Bach continued to play and compose for the organ, and to perform concert music with the duke's ensemble. He also began to write the preludes and fugues which were later assembled into his monumental work "The Well-Tempered Clavier" (""—""Clavier"" meaning clavichord or harpsichord), consisting of two books, compiled in 1722 and 1744, each containing a prelude and fugue in every major and minor key.
Also in Weimar Bach started work on the "Little Organ Book" for his eldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann, containing traditional Lutheran chorales (hymn tunes) set in complex textures to train organists. In 1713 Bach was offered a post in Halle when he advised the authorities during a renovation by Christoph Cuntzius of the main organ in the west gallery of the . Johann Kuhnau and Bach played again when it was inaugurated in 1716. Musicologists debate whether his first Christmas cantata , was premiered here in 1713, or if it was performed for the bicentennial of the Reformation in 1717.
In the spring of 1714, Bach was promoted to "", an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the castle church. The first three cantatas Bach composed in Weimar were , for Palm Sunday, which coincided with the Annunciation that year, , for Jubilate Sunday, and for Pentecost.
In 1717, Bach eventually fell out of favour in Weimar and was, according to a translation of the court secretary's report, jailed for almost a month before being unfavourably dismissed: "On November 6, , the quondam concertmaster and organist Bach was confined to the County Judge's place of detention for too stubbornly forcing the issue of his dismissal and finally on December 2 was freed from arrest with notice of his unfavourable discharge."
Köthen (1717–23).
Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen hired Bach to serve as his (director of music) in 1717. Prince Leopold, himself a musician, appreciated Bach's talents, paid him well, and gave him considerable latitude in composing and performing. The prince was Calvinist and did not use elaborate music in his worship; accordingly, most of Bach's work from this period was secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg concertos. Bach also composed secular cantatas for the court such as . At least one significant influence upon Bach's musical development during his years with the Prince are recorded by Stauffer as Bach's "complete embrace of dance music, perhaps the most important influence on his mature style other than his adoption of Vivaldi's music in Weimar".
Despite being born in the same year and only about apart, Bach and Handel never met. In 1719 Bach made the journey from Köthen to Halle with the intention of meeting Handel, however Handel had recently departed the city. In 1730, Bach's son Friedmann travelled to Halle to invite Handel to visit the Bach family in Leipzig, but the visit did not come to pass.
On 7 July 1720, while Bach was abroad with Prince Leopold, Bach's first wife suddenly died. The following year, he met Anna Magdalena Wilcke, a young, highly gifted soprano 17 years his junior, who performed at the court in Köthen; they married on 3 December 1721. Together they had 13 more children, six of whom survived into adulthood: Gottfried Heinrich, Johann Christoph Friedrich, and Johann Christian, all of whom became significant musicians; Elisabeth Juliane Friederica (1726–81), who married Bach's pupil Johann Christoph Altnickol; Johanna Carolina (1737–81); and Regina Susanna (1742–1809).
Leipzig (1723–50).
In 1723, Bach was appointed Cantor of the at the in Leipzig, and Director of Music in the principal churches in the town, namely the and the , the church of the University of Leipzig. This was a prestigious post in the mercantile city in the Electorate of Saxony, which he held for 27 years until his death. It brought him into contact with the political machinations of his employer, Leipzig's city council.
Bach was required to instruct the students of the in singing and to provide church music for the main churches in Leipzig. Bach was required to teach Latin, but he was allowed to employ a deputy to do this instead. A cantata was required for the church services on Sundays and additional church holidays during the liturgical year. He usually performed his own cantatas, most of which were composed during his first three years in Leipzig. The first of these was , first performed in the on 30 May 1723, the first Sunday after Trinity. Bach collected his cantatas in annual cycles. Five are mentioned in obituaries, three are extant. Of the over three hundred cantatas which Bach composed in Leipzig, approximately one hundred have been lost to posterity. Most of these concerted works expound on the Gospel readings prescribed for every Sunday and feast day in the Lutheran year. Bach started a second annual cycle the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724, and composed only chorale cantatas, each based on a single church hymn. These include , , , and .
Bach drew the soprano and alto choristers from the School, and the tenors and basses from the School and elsewhere in Leipzig. Performing at weddings and funerals provided extra income for these groups; it was probably for this purpose, and for in-school training, that he wrote at least six motets, at least five of which are for double choir. As part of his regular church work, he performed other composers' motets, which served as formal models for his own.
Bach broadened his composing and performing beyond the liturgy by taking over, in March 1729, the directorship of the Collegium Musicum, a secular performance ensemble started by the composer Georg Philipp Telemann. This was one of the dozens of private societies in the major German-speaking cities that was established by musically active university students; these societies had become increasingly important in public musical life and were typically led by the most prominent professionals in a city. In the words of Christoph Wolff, assuming the directorship was a shrewd move that "consolidated Bach's firm grip on Leipzig's principal musical institutions". Year round, the Leipzig's Collegium Musicum performed regularly in venues such as the Café Zimmermann, a coffeehouse on Catherine Street off the main market square. Many of Bach's works during the 1730s and 1740s were written for and performed by the Collegium Musicum; among these were parts of his "" ("Keyboard Practice") and many of his violin and harpsichord concertos.
In 1733, Bach composed a Missa of "Kyrie" and "Gloria" which he later incorporated in his Mass in B minor. He presented the manuscript to the King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and Elector of Saxony, August III in an eventually successful bid to persuade the monarch to appoint him as Royal Court Composer. He later extended this work into a full Mass, by adding a "Credo", "Sanctus" and "Agnus Dei", the music for which was partly based on his own cantatas, partly new composed. Bach's appointment as court composer was part of his long-term struggle to achieve greater bargaining power with the Leipzig Council. Although the complete mass was probably never performed during the composer's lifetime, it is considered to be among the greatest choral works of all time. Between 1737 and 1739, Bach's former pupil Carl Gotthelf Gerlach took over the directorship of the Collegium Musicum.
In 1747, Bach visited the court of King Frederick II of Prussia at Potsdam. The king played a theme for Bach and challenged him to improvise a fugue based on his theme. Bach improvised a three-part fugue on one of Frederick's fortepianos, then a novelty, and later presented the king with a "Musical Offering" which consists of fugues, canons and a trio based on this theme. Its six-part fugue includes a slightly altered subject more suitable for extensive elaboration.
In the same year Bach joined the Corresponding Society of the Musical Sciences (') of Lorenz Christoph Mizler. On the occasion of his entry into the Society Bach composed the Canonic Variations on "Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her" (BWV 769). A portrait had to be submitted by each member of the Society, so in 1746, during the preparation of Bach's entry, the famous Bach-portrait was painted by Elias Gottlob Haussmann. The "Canon triplex á 6 Voc." (BWV 1076) on this portrait was dedicated to the Society. Other late works by Bach may also have a connection with the music theory based Society. One of those works was "The Art of Fugue", which consists of 18 complex fugues and canons based on a simple theme. Bach never completed the final fugue. "The Art of Fugue" was only published posthumously in 1751.
Bach's last completed large work was the Mass in B minor (1748–49) which Stauffer describes as "Bach's most universal church music. Consisting mainly of recycled movements from cantatas written over a thirty-five year period, it allowed Bach to survey his vocal pieces one last time and pick select movements for further revision and refinement." The final work Bach completed was a chorale prelude for organ, entitled "" ("Before thy throne I now appear", BWV 668a) which he dictated to his son-in-law, Johann Christoph Altnickol, from his deathbed. When the notes on the three staves of the final cadence are counted and mapped onto the Roman alphabet, the initials "JSB" are found.
Death (1750).
Bach's health declined in 1749; on 2 June, Heinrich von Brühl wrote to one of the Leipzig burgomasters to request that his music director, Gottlob Harrer, fill the ' and ' posts "upon the eventual ... decease of Mr. Bach". Bach became increasingly blind, so the British eye surgeon John Taylor operated on Bach while visiting Leipzig in March or April 1750.
On 28 July 1750 Bach died at the age of 65. A contemporary newspaper reported "the unhappy consequences of the very unsuccessful eye operation" as the cause of death. Modern historians speculate that the cause of death was a stroke complicated by pneumonia. His son Emanuel and his pupil Johann Friedrich Agricola wrote an obituary of Bach. In 1754, Lorenz Christoph Mizler published a detailed obituary of Bach in the musical periodical "". This obituary arguably remains "the richest and most trustworthy" early source document about Bach.
Bach's estate included five harpsichords, two lute-harpsichords, three violins, three violas, two cellos, a viola da gamba, a lute and a spinet, and 52 "sacred books", including books by Martin Luther and Josephus. He was originally buried at Old St. John's Cemetery in Leipzig. His grave went unmarked for nearly 150 years. In 1894 his coffin was finally found and moved to a vault in St. John's Church. This building was destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II, so in 1950 Bach's remains were taken to their present grave at Leipzig's Church of St. Thomas.
Legacy.
After his death, Bach's reputation as a composer at first declined; his work was regarded as old-fashioned compared to the emerging galant style, a movement which can be seen as the precursor to the classical style of the late eighteenth century. Initially he was remembered more as a player and teacher.
During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, Bach was recognised by several prominent composers for his keyboard work. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Frédéric Chopin, Robert Schumann, and Felix Mendelssohn were among his admirers; they began writing in a more contrapuntal style after being exposed to Bach's music. Beethoven described him as """", the "original father of harmony".
Bach's reputation among the wider public was enhanced in part by Johann Nikolaus Forkel's 1802 biography of the composer. Felix Mendelssohn significantly contributed to the revival of Bach's reputation with his 1829 Berlin performance of the "St Matthew Passion". In 1850, the (Bach Society) was founded to promote the works; in 1899 the Society published a comprehensive edition of the composer's works with little editorial intervention.
During the twentieth century, the process of recognising the musical as well as the pedagogic value of some of the works continued, perhaps most notably in the promotion of the cello suites by Pablo Casals, the first major performer to record these suites. Another development has been the growth of the "authentic" or "period performance" movement, which attempts to present music as the composer intended it. Examples include the playing of keyboard works on harpsichord rather than modern grand piano and the use of small choirs or single voices instead of the larger forces favoured by nineteenth- and early twentieth-century performers.
Bach's music is frequently bracketed with the literature of William Shakespeare and the science of Isaac Newton. In Germany, during the twentieth century, many streets were named and statues were erected in honour of Bach. His music features three times – more than any other composer – on the Voyager Golden Record, a phonograph record containing a broad sample of the images, common sounds, languages, and music of Earth, sent into outer space with the two Voyager probes.
A large crater in the Bach quadrangle on Mercury is named in Bach's honor as are the main-belt asteroids 1814 Bach and 1482 Sebastiana.
Works.
In 1950, a thematic catalogue called ' (Bach Works Catalogue) was compiled by Wolfgang Schmieder. Schmieder largely followed the ', a comprehensive edition of the composer's works that was produced between 1850 and 1905: BWV 1–224 are cantatas; BWV 225–249, large-scale choral works including his Passions; BWV 250–524, chorales and sacred songs; BWV 525–748, organ works; BWV 772–994, other keyboard works; BWV 995–1000, lute music; BWV 1001–40, chamber music; BWV 1041–71, orchestral music; and BWV 1072–1126, canons and fugues.
Organ works.
Bach was best known during his lifetime as an organist, organ consultant, and composer of organ works in both the traditional German free genres—such as preludes, fantasias, and toccatas—and stricter forms, such as chorale preludes and fugues. At a young age, he established a reputation for his great creativity and ability to integrate foreign styles into his organ works. A decidedly North German influence was exerted by Georg Böhm, with whom Bach came into contact in Lüneburg, and Dieterich Buxtehude, whom the young organist visited in Lübeck in 1704 on an extended leave of absence from his job in Arnstadt. Around this time, Bach copied the works of numerous French and Italian composers to gain insights into their compositional languages, and later arranged violin concertos by Vivaldi and others for organ and harpsichord. During his most productive period (1708–14) he composed about a dozen pairs of preludes and fugues, five toccatas and fugues, and the "Little Organ Book", an unfinished collection of 46 short chorale preludes that demonstrates compositional techniques in the setting of chorale tunes. After leaving Weimar, Bach wrote less for organ, although some of his best-known works (the six trio sonatas, the German Organ Mass in "" from 1739, and the Great Eighteen chorales, revised late in his life) were composed after his leaving Weimar. Bach was extensively engaged later in his life in consulting on organ projects, testing newly built organs, and dedicating organs in afternoon recitals.
Other keyboard works.
Bach wrote many works for harpsichord, some of which may have been played on the clavichord. Many of his keyboard works are anthologies that encompass whole theoretical systems in an encyclopaedic fashion. 
Among Bach's lesser known keyboard works are seven toccatas (BWV 910–916), four duets (BWV 802–805), sonatas for keyboard (BWV 963–967), the Six Little Preludes (BWV 933–938), and the "" (BWV 989).
Orchestral and chamber music.
Bach wrote for single instruments, duets, and small ensembles. Many of his solo works, such as his six sonatas and partitas for violin (BWV 1001–1006), six cello suites (BWV 1007–1012), and partita for solo flute (BWV 1013), are widely considered among the most profound works in the repertoire. Bach composed a suite and several other works for solo lute. He wrote trio sonatas; solo sonatas (accompanied by continuo) for the flute and for the viola da gamba; and a large number of canons and ricercars, mostly with unspecified instrumentation. The most significant examples of the latter are contained in "The Art of Fugue" and "The Musical Offering".
Bach's best-known orchestral works are the Brandenburg concertos, so named because he submitted them in the hope of gaining employment from Margrave Christian Ludwig of Brandenburg-Schwedt in 1721; his application was unsuccessful. These works are examples of the concerto grosso genre. Other surviving works in the concerto form include two violin concertos (BWV 1041 and BWV 1042); a concerto for two violins in D minor (BWV 1043), often referred to as Bach's "double" concerto; and concertos for one to four harpsichords. It is widely accepted that many of the harpsichord concertos were not original works, but arrangements of his concertos for other instruments now lost. A number of violin, oboe, and flute concertos have been reconstructed from these. In addition to concertos, Bach wrote four orchestral suites, and a series of stylised dances for orchestra, each preceded by a French overture.
Vocal and choral works.
Cantatas.
As the , beginning mid of 1723, Bach performed a cantata each Sunday and feast day that corresponded to the lectionary readings of the week. Although Bach performed cantatas by other composers, he composed at least three entire annual cycles of cantatas at Leipzig, in addition to those composed at Mühlhausen and Weimar. In total he wrote more than 300 sacred cantatas, of which approximately 200 survive.
His cantatas vary greatly in form and instrumentation, including those for solo singers, single choruses, small instrumental groups, and grand orchestras. Many consist of a large opening chorus followed by one or more recitative-aria pairs for soloists (or duets) and a concluding chorale. The recitative is part of the corresponding Bible reading for the week and the aria is a contemporary reflection on it. The melody of the concluding chorale often appears as a cantus firmus in the opening movement. Among his best known cantatas are:
In addition, Bach wrote a number of secular cantatas, usually for civic events such as council inaugurations. These include wedding cantatas, the "Wedding Quodlibet", the "Peasant Cantata", and the "Coffee Cantata".
Motets.
Bach's motets (BWV 225–231) are pieces on sacred themes for choir and basso continuo, with instruments playing colla parte. Several of them were composed for funerals. The six motets certainly composed by Bach are ', ', ', ', ', and '. The motet "" (BWV 231) is spurious; it is part of an incomplete cantata or motet by Telemann.
Passions.
Bach's large choral-orchestral works include the grand scale "St Matthew Passion" and "St John Passion", both written for Good Friday vesper services at the and the in alternate years, and the "Christmas Oratorio" (a set of six cantatas for use in the liturgical season of Christmas). The two versions of the "Magnificat" (one in E-flat major, with four interpolated Christmas-related movements, and the later and better-known version in D major), the "Easter Oratorio", and the "Ascension Oratorio" are smaller and simpler than the Passions and the "Christmas Oratorio".
Mass in B minor.
Bach assembled his last large work, the Mass in B minor, near the end of his life, between 1748 and 1749, mostly from pieces composed earlier (such as the cantatas and ). The mass was never performed in full during Bach's lifetime. All of these movements have substantial solo parts as well as choruses. It is not known what direction of development Bach had intended for his last Mass to take. As Stauffer states, "If Bach had lived longer, it is likely that he would have created a definitive fair copy of the Mass, similar to those of the St. John and St. Matthew Passions... As Otto Bettmann once remarked, Bach's 'music set in order what life cannot.
Musical style.
Bach's musical style arose from his skill in contrapuntal invention and motivic control, his flair for improvisation, his exposure to North and South German, Italian and French music, and his devotion to the Lutheran liturgy. His access to musicians, scores and instruments as a child and a young man and his emerging talent for writing tightly woven music of powerful sonority, allowed him to develop an eclectic, energetic musical style in which foreign influences were combined with an intensified version of the pre-existing German musical language. From the period 1713–14 onward he learned much from the style of the Italians.
During the Baroque period, many composers only wrote the framework, and performers embellished this framework with ornaments and other elaboration. This practice varied considerably between the schools of European music; Bach notated most or all of the details of his melodic lines, leaving little for performers to interpolate. This accounted for his control over the dense contrapuntal textures that he favoured, and decreased leeway for spontaneous variation of musical lines. At the same time, Bach left the instrumentation of major works including "The Art of Fugue" open.
Bach's devout relationship with the Christian God in the Lutheran tradition and the high demand for religious music of his times placed sacred music at the centre of his repertory. He taught Luther's Small Catechism as the in Leipzig, and some of his pieces represent it; the Lutheran chorale hymn tune was the basis of much of his work. He wrote more cogent, tightly integrated chorale preludes than most. The large-scale structure of some of Bach's sacred works is evidence of subtle, elaborate planning. For example, the "St Matthew Passion" illustrates the Passion with Bible text reflected in recitatives, arias, choruses, and chorales.
Bach's drive to display musical achievements was evident in his composition. He wrote much for the keyboard and led its elevation from continuo to solo instrument with harpsichord concertos and keyboard obbligato. Virtuosity is a key element in other pieces, such as the Prelude and Fugue in E minor (BWV 548) for organ in which virtuosic passages are mapped onto alternating flute and reed solos within the fugal development.
Bach produced collections of movements that explored the range of artistic and technical possibilities inherent in various genres. The most famous example is "The Well-Tempered Clavier", in which each book presents a prelude and fugue in every major and minor key. Each fugue displays a variety of contrapuntal and fugal techniques.
Performances.
Present-day Bach performers usually pursue one of two traditions: so-called "authentic performance practice", utilising historical techniques; or the use of modern instruments and playing techniques, often with larger ensembles. In Bach's time orchestras and choirs were usually smaller than those of later composers, and even Bach's most ambitious choral works, such as his Mass in B minor and Passions, were composed for relatively modest forces. Some of Bach's important chamber music does not indicate instrumentation, which allows for a greater variety of ensembles.
Easy listening realisations of Bach's music and their use in advertising contributed greatly to Bach's popularisation in the second half of the twentieth century. Among these were the Swingle Singers' versions of Bach pieces (for instance, the "" from Orchestral Suite No. 3, or the "" chorale prelude) and Wendy Carlos' 1968 "Switched-On Bach", which used the Moog electronic synthesiser. Jazz musicians have adopted Bach's music, with Jacques Loussier, Ian Anderson, Uri Caine, and the Modern Jazz Quartet among those creating jazz versions of Bach works.

Zach Hamill

Zachary Robert Hamill (born September 23, 1988) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre who is currently playing for the Barys Astana in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).
Hamill was drafted in the 1st round, 8th overall by the Boston Bruins in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. He spent his entire WHL career with the Everett Silvertips.
Personal life.
Hamill was born on September 23, 1988 in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia to Scott and Lonnie Hamill. He has two siblings, Carson and Paisley. His brother, Carson, played junior hockey for the Langley Hornets of the BCHL and currently plays at Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Missouri. He attended Riverside Secondary School in Port Coquitlam.
Playing career.
Junior.
Hamill was drafted in the 1st round, 3rd overall by the Everett Silvertips in the 2003 WHL Bantam Draft. Shortly thereafter on October 8, 2003, he made his WHL debut against the Seattle Thunderbirds. Although playing in only 4 regular season games in the early part of the 2003–04 season, Hamill finished with 2 assists before being reassigned to the Port Coquitlam Buckaroos of the PIJHL. He returned to the Silvertips for their 2004 WHL playoff run, playing in 20 games. The 2004–05 WHL season was Hamill's first full WHL season, playing in 57 games. He finished his rookie season with a respectable 33 points. This season also saw Hamill represent Canada Pacific at the 2005 World U-17 Hockey Challenge in Lethbridge, Alberta. During the off-season, Hamill represented Canada at the 2005 U-18 Junior World Cup in Břeclav, Czech Republic and Piešťany, Slovakia. In his sophomore season, Hamill continued to better his play. In December, Hamill represented Team WHL in the 2005 ADT Canada-Russia Challenge. Hamill finished the year with 59 points in 53 games, an average of over a point per game. Hamill's play was rewarded when on June 22, 2006 he was invited to Canada's National Junior Team Development Camp.
Hamill's 2006–07 season season was arguably his best. In November, Hamill once again represented Team WHL in the 2006 ADT Canada-Russia Challenge and in January, he played in the 2007 CHL Top Prospects Game. Hamill was named the WHL's player of the week for the week of January 22–28th, scoring 13 points in 4 games. Hamill was also named the player of the month for January after collecting 24 points in 12 games. With 93 points at the end of the season, Hamill won the Bob Clarke Trophy as the WHL's leading scorer and was named to the WHL West First All-Star Team. With his 61 assists and 93 points, Hamill claimed both the Silvertips' single season assists and points records. Hamill also finished the season with seven Silvertips franchise career records.
Professional.
On August 8, 2007, shortly over a month after being drafted, Hamill signed his first professional contract with the Bruins. After attending Bruins training camp in 2007 and playing in one pre-season game, Hamill was returned to the Silvertips for the 2007–08 WHL season.
At the completion of the Silvertips season, Hamill joined the Providence Bruins. During a recall stint with the Bruins in the 2009–10 season, he was credited with his first NHL point on April 11, 2010, with an assist against the Washington Capitals.
During the 2010-11 season, he played in 3 games for the Boston Bruins, earning an assist against the Montreal Canadiens on February 9, 2011. The Bruins won the Stanley Cup that season. Although he did not qualify to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup, he received a Stanley Cup ring.
On February 6, 2012, the Boston Bruins placed Hamill on waivers, and he was sent down to Boston's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, Providence Bruins, after he cleared waivers on February 7, 2012.
On May 26, 2012 he was traded by the Bruins to the Washington Capitals for forward Chris Bourque. With the 2012 NHL lockout in effect he was directly assigned to AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears. In the 2012–13 season he tallied 22 points in 40 games with the Bears before he was traded by the Capitals to the Florida Panthers for forward Casey Wellman on January 31, 2013. He remained in the AHL with the San Antonio Rampage, and contributed with 18 points in 26 games. On April 11, 2013, he was reassigned on loan by the Panthers to the Milwaukee Admirals.
On December 24, 2013, Hamill signed a one-year contract with Barys Astana of the Kontinental Hockey League.

Akshar Purushottam Upasana

Akshar Purushottam Upasana is an interpretation by Shastriji Maharaj of the teachings of Swaminarayan which led to the creation of the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) in 1907. It could also be referred to as "Brahman Parabrahman Upasana" or "Bhakta Bhagwan Upasana". According to this interpretation, Gunatitanand Swami is the successor of Swaminarayan as opposed to the Acharyas (heads of the Swaminarayan Sampraday). Shastri Yagnapurushdas created BAPS as a result of this difference in belief.
Interpretation of Bhagwan Swaminarayan's Teachings.
Bhagwan Swaminarayan's philosophy defined five eternal entities, namely Jiva, Ishwar, Maya, Brahman and Parabrahman. Followers of Akshar Purushottam Upasana believe that Brahman and Parabrahman are the highest two of these entities. Whilst other schools of Hindu philosophy hold Brahman and Parabrahman to be one and the same, Bhagwan Swaminarayan's philosophy holds them to be two separate entities. Throughout his discourses in the Vachanamrut, the primary scripture of the Swaminarayan Sampraday, Bhagwan Swaminarayan referred to Brahman as "Akshar, Aksharbrahman, or Akshardham". Similarly, he referred to Parabrahman as "Purushottam, Paramatma, or Bhagwan".
He taught that Akshar had two forms, a formless all-pervading heavenly abode and a physical form that served the Lord wherever he went. Furthermore, he preached that to offer pure worship to God, one needed to become "Brahmarup", or gain qualities like Brahman, and then offer worship to Purushottam. For this reason, the essence of Akshar Purushottam Upasana can be described as follows: "to become "Aksharup" and then offer worship to Purushottam."
To achieve this status, aspirants were instructed to associate with and serve Brahman - often referred to as the Sant, Satpurush, or Sadhu - who incarnated with God. They were also instructed to offer worship to him, in the same manner as the worship offered to God as, according to His words, "When one has darshan of such a Sant, one should realise 'I have had the darshan of God himself.'"
The interpretation of the terms "Sant", "Satpurush", and "Sadhu" being synonymous with 'Brahman' is based upon the words of Bhagwan Swaminarayan in Vachanamrut discourses like Gadhada II-59 where it is said that, "God's Sant is greater than even Bhava, Brahma, and other deities." Applying Bhagwan Swaminarayan's philosophy regarding the five eternal entities, followers of Akshar Purushottam Upasana conclude that the only entity Bhagwan Swaminarayan could be discussing is Brahman, since Parabrahman is God Himself, and "Bhava, Brahma, and other deities" are classed as Ishwar.
Followers of BAPS regard the term saint in this context to be singular, however followers of the Swaminarayan Sampraday believe that Bhagwan Swaminarayan is referring to the association of all saints who have reached the elevated status of Brahm, as Bhagwan Swaminarayan does not specify any one specific saint in the scripture Vachanamrut. Also they state that it would be almost impossible for all devotees around the world to associate with just one saint, and it would make the role of all other saints redundant. BAPS followers claim that they feel in union with Pramukh Swami Maharaj the current spiritual leader of BAPS. BAPS has over 860 Saints, 9000 centers, 400 Mandirs, 2 Akshardham complexes etc.
Gunatitanand Swami as Mul Akshar.
Followers of BAPS and Akshar Purushottam Upasana hold Gunatitanand Swami, a saint and paramhansa of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, to be the personified form of Brahman as discussed above. They cite several references, incidents, and evidence, as seen below.
Gunatitanand Swami as Successor.
In the context of Akshar Purushottam Upasana, every spiritual Guru in Bhagwan Swaminarayan's succession is believed the incarnation of Aksharbrahman in whom the Lord resides fully and eternally. As every Guru is the same Aksharbrahman entity, the devotees feel no spiritual change, except the physical change of another successor. It is clear that the Guru is not God, but is God's ideal devotee in whom God resides eternally. According to this philosophy, Gunatitanand Swami was the first successor to Swaminarayan. He was succeeded by Bhagatji Maharaj, Shastriji Maharaj, Yogiji Maharaj and Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the current spiritual leader of BAPS. Since the inception of BAPS, Shastriji Maharaj and Pramukh Swami have shared dual roles of spiritual and administrative heads of the sect while Yogiji Maharaj only held the position of spiritual head.
Followers of the Swaminarayan Sampraday do not accept this successorship. They accept the instructions of Swaminarayan who formally adopted a son from his brothers and appointed them to the office of Acharya for the Ahmedabad Gadi and Vadtal Gadi. This was done so that they would maintain a direct line of blood descent from his family. It is stated in scriptures established by Swaminarayan primarily through the Desh Vibhag Lekh, with further instructions in the Shikshapatri, Vachanamrut and Satsangi Jeevan.
As a separate sect, BAPS has not followed the authority of the Acharya's since its creation. Additionally, BAPS states that for administrative purposes, he divided his mandirs into two regions and appointed two acharyas, Raghuvirji Maharaj and Ayodhyaprasadji Maharaj to guide the progress.

Shreve Hall

Shreve Hall originally opened the fall semester of the 1970 academic year. Named for Eleanor Burns Shreve and her husband Randolph Norris Shreve, former Purdue University faculty, Shreve was the first residence hall at Purdue designed to be co-educational, although Shreve was originally built for the purpose of adding a new Women’s hall to Purdue. When built, Shreve Hall was the fourth largest residence hall on the west side of Purdue’s campus.
The Design.
From the outside Shreve Hall was built to resemble the three other eight story residence halls already located at Purdue University, but the inside contains the best of each residence hall at Purdue. Shreve Hall was built to house 864 residents with 54 residents on each floor. Being designed to be a women’s hall Shreve was built with a kitchenette and a drip-dry room, a place where residents can hang wet clothes that cannot be dried, on every floor. Each floor was also designed to have a study room on every floor. Shreve was also built with many other amenities the other halls lacked. Shreve was built with a stag lounge on the first floor of both wings to be used for studying or social gatherings; the hall was also built with a second floor common area including a recreational lounge, a vending lounge, a study lounge, a mail room, and the main lobby. Shreve was also built to house its own dining court with a large dining room separated into three different sections for residents to sit in depending on their mood. The rooms were designed to give the residents choices on how to arrange the rooms. The beds were made to stand alone and be separate or to be bunk beds. The rooms also feature built in dresser drawers and walk in closets. Each room also contains a high top desk that can either be placed at the foot of the bed, creating an alcove, or can be turned with the back against the wall.
Present day.
Although Shreve hall was built with student opinions and to offer the best of every residence hall already located at Purdue modern day; Shreve has many new things to offer residents. Each stag lounge houses a plasma TV, several tables with chairs, and a few couches. The recreational lounge plays home to two billiard tables, two ping pong tables, an air-hockey table, a foosball table, and a big screen TV with several couches. The formal lobby has several over-sized chairs as well as several couches. The formal lounge also contains a piano. The once was dining court is now uninhabited and the dining room now serves as a quiet study lounge. The lobby, the basement laundry room, and lounges have the only wireless internet in the building. 
The days of bunk beds have long since been replaced; today most students loft their beds to utilize space more adequately. Other changes that have taken place since Shreve’s opening in 1970 are the depletion of study rooms on every floor and the changing of kitchenettes to only the even floors. The drip-dry rooms have recently been converted to temporary housing until other rooms become available.

Normal anion gap acidosis

In renal physiology, normal anion gap acidosis, and less precisely non-anion gap acidosis, is an acidosis that is "not" accompanied by an abnormally increased anion gap. 
The most common etiology of normal anion gap acidosis is diarrhea with a renal tubular acidosis being a distant second.
Differential diagnosis.
The differential diagnosis of normal anion gap acidosis is relatively short (when compared to the differential diagnosis of "acidosis"):
It can be remembered with the mnemonic "HARD-UPS".
As opposed to high anion gap acidosis (which involves increased organic acid production), normal anion gap acidosis involves either increased production of chloride (hyperchloremic acidosis) or increased excretion of bicarbonate.
One more commonly used older mnemonic is "USED

<doc id="9906421" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9906421" title="New South Wales Coal Compensation Review Tribunal">
New South Wales Coal Compensation Review Tribunal

The New South Wales Coal Compensation Review Tribunal is a tribunal in New South Wales, a state of Australia, which has responsibility for determining appeals about compensation payable when coal in the state was compulsorily acquired in 1981.
Background.
In 1981 the New South Wales Government passed legislation which vested all unmined coal to the crown. The effect of Coal Acquisition Act 1981 (NSW) was that the government became the owner of all unmined coal in the state. Vesting of the ownership of the coal enabled the government to tax the mining of coal, a situation it was not allowed to do when coal was privately owned.
According to the New South Wales Coal Compensation Board’s annual report, the net benefit to the State from the acquisition of private coal is estimated at around $10 billion after taking into account compensation payments totalling $682 million
The board and the tribunal were established in 1985 to address concerns by former coal owners through the introduction of the act. Both bodies are the result of recommendations of the Coal Compensation Taskforce Report. 
Constitution.
The tribunal is established under the Coal Acquisition (Compensation) Arrangements 1985 (NSW). Those arrangements are made by the Governor of New South Wales under the Coal Acquisition Act 1981 (NSW), a law which entitles the governor to determine what compensation should be payable for the acquisition of coal in 1981.
The tribunal consists of six members appointed by the Governor. Two of those members are to be lawyers nominated by the Attorney General of New South Wales. The remaining four members are nominated by the Minister for Mineral Resources and are generally persons who have expertise in the coal industry.
The governor may appoint one of the lawyer members as the chairperson and the other as deputy chairperson. 
There is also provision for the governor to appoint alternates for the members.
Jurisdiction.
The tribunal has jurisdiction to decide whether the compensation determined as payable by the board as a result of the compulsory acquisition of coal is correct. It may also determine the amount of compensation payable as a result of that acquisition. 
The tribunal sits as a three member panel with either the chairperson or deputy presiding.
Caseload.
According to the tribunal's Annual Report, it determined 67 appeals in 2004 and had 26 outstanding. 
The New South Wales government flagged that it wished for all compensation claims to be determined by March 2007 and the tribunal will cease once all those claims have been finalised.
Appeals.
There no appeal rights from the decision of the tribunal.
In certain cases, prerogative relief may be available from the Supreme Court of New South Wales. See for example NSW Coal Compensation Board v Nardell Colliery Pty Ltd NSWCA 35. 
Chairperson.
The current chairperson is Mr GR Leader.
Location.
The tribunal has offices at both:

<doc id="9906468" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9906468" title="Structure of the United States Navy">
Structure of the United States Navy

The structure of the United States Navy consists of four main bodies: the Office of the Secretary of the Navy, the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, the operating forces (described below), and the Shore Establishment.
Office of the Chief of Naval Operations.
The Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OpNav) includes the Chief of Naval Operations, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, the Deputy Chiefs of Naval Operations, the Assistant Chiefs of Naval Operations, the Chief of Legislative Affairs, the Director of Naval Nuclear Propulsion, the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, and other members of the Navy or Marines or civilians in the Department of the Navy assigned or detailed to the Office.
As of June 2008, there was a DCNO Manpower and Personnel/Chief of Naval Personnel (N1), the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Dominance (N2/N6), (established October 2009), DCNO Plans, Policy, and Operations (N3/N5), 
Fleet Readiness and Logistics (N4), DCNO Warfare Requirements and Programmes (N6/N7), and DCNO Resources, Requirements and Assessments (N8). In addition there was a Director of T&E and Operational Requirements, Surgeon General of the Navy, Chief of Naval Reserves, Chief of Oceanography, and Chief of Chaplains of the Navy.
Operating forces.
The operating forces consists of eight components: United States Fleet Forces Command, United States Pacific Fleet, United States Naval Forces Central Command, United States Naval Forces Southern Command, United States Naval Forces Europe, U.S. Fleet Cyber Command, United States Navy Reserve, United States Naval Special Warfare Command, and Operational Test and Evaluation Force (OPTEVFOR).
Fleets in the United States Navy take on the role of force provider; they do not carry out military operations independently, rather they train and maintain naval units that will subsequently be provided to the naval forces component of each Unified Combatant Command. While not widely publicized, groups of ships departing U.S. waters for operational missions gain a Task force type designation, almost always with the Second or Third Fleets. On entry into another numbered fleet's area of responsibility, they are redesignated as a task group from that fleet. For example, a carrier task group departing the Eastern Seaboard for the Mediterranean might start out as Task Group 20.1; on entry into the Mediterranean, it might become ('inchop') Task Group 60.1.
The United States Navy has six active numbered fleets. These six numbered fleets are grouped into operating forces: the U.S. Pacific Fleet's 3rd Fleet and 7th Fleet, Naval Forces Europe's 6th Fleet, Naval Forces Central Command's 5th Fleet, Fleet Cyber Command's 10th Fleet and Naval Forces Southern Command's 4th Fleet.
Command listing.
The Navy maintains several "Naval Forces Commands" which operate naval shore facilities and serve as liaison units to local ground forces of the Air Force and Army. Such commands are answerable to a Fleet Commander as the shore protector component of the afloat command. In times of war, Commander Naval Forces Korea becomes a Task Force (Task Force 78) of the United States Seventh Fleet. Other Naval Force Commands may similarly augment to become number fleet task forces.
Historical organization.
The organization of the Navy has changed incrementally over time. During World War II administrative organization for many ship types included divisions, for example Battleship Divisions (abbreviated BatDivs), Cruiser Divisions, Destroyer Divisions, or Escort Divisions (CortDivs), usually composed of two ships, often members of the same class. These made up squadrons (e.g. Battle Squadron, Cruiser Squadron, Escort Squadron (CortRon) etc.) of several divisions. Yet the exigencies of World War II forced the creation of the task force system where ships no longer fought solely as part of same-type divisions or squadrons. This was gradually reflected in administrative arrangements; by the 1970s, formations such as Cruiser-Destroyer Groups (CruDesGrus) came into existence.
The United States First Fleet existed after World War II from 1947 at least, but it was redesignated Third Fleet in early 1973. Other fleets, such as the 10th and 12th, were active during World War II, the 12th in European waters as part of United States Naval Forces Europe.
The 2nd Fleet was disestablished in 2011.
The Shore Establishment.
The following shore-based bureaus, commands and components are directly subordinate to the Chief of Naval Operations:"
Relationships with other service branches.
United States Marine Corps.
In 1834, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) came under the Department of the Navy. Historically, the United States Navy has enjoyed a unique relationship with the Marines, partly because they both specialize in seaborne operations. At the highest level of civilian organization, the USMC is part of the Department of the Navy and reports to the Secretary of the Navy. However, it is considered to be a distinct, separate service branch and not a subset of the Navy; the highest ranking Marine officer, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, does not report to a Navy officer. Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients are awarded the Navy variant, and Marines are eligible to receive the Navy Cross. The United States Naval Academy trains Marine Corps commissioned officers while prospective Navy officers undergo instruction by Marine NCO Drill Instructors at OCS. Naval Aviation includes Navy and Marine aviators, flight officers, and aircrew.
The relationship extends to the operational theater as well. As amphibious assault specialists, Marines often deploy on, and attack from, Navy vessels; while being transported on Navy ships, they must obey the orders of the captain of the vessel. Marine aviation tailhook squadrons train and operate alongside Navy squadrons, flying similar missions and often flying sorties together. Other types of Marine air squadrons operate from amphibious assault ships in support of Marine amphibious operations. Navy and Marine squadrons use the same NATOPS aviation manuals and procedures. The USMC does not train chaplains, hospital corpsmen or medical doctors; thus officers and enlisted sailors from the Navy fulfill these roles. They generally wear Marine uniforms that are emblazoned with Navy insignia and markings to distinguish themselves from Marines. Corpsmen and chaplains enjoy a great sense of camaraderie with the Marines due in part because they work closely with them and often are embedded with Marine units. They operate under the command of the Marine Corps under the auspices of the Fleet Marine Force, often called the "green side".
Because of the lack of full-scale amphibious operations in recent conflicts, there has been pressure to cut the "gator navy" below the two-regiment requirement of the Marines. This is a reduction from the programmatic goal of 2.5 Marine Expeditionary Brigades and actual structure of 2.07 MEB equivalents in 1999.
The relationship between the US Navy and US Marine Corps is also one of mutual respect, and that respect is manifested in various policies and procedural regulations. For example, per US Marine and Navy drill manuals, in a formation consisting of both Marines and Sailors, Marines are to be present at the front (in column) and left (on line), regardless of rank. This is a symbol of the special status and honor granted to US Marines, and is a unique aspect of the Navy-Marine relationship.
United States Coast Guard.
Although the Posse Comitatus Act, which prevents federal military personnel from acting in a law enforcement capacity, applies only to the Army and Air Force, Department of Defense rules effectively require the Navy and Marine Corps to act as if Posse Comitatus did apply, preventing them from enforcing Federal law. The United States Coast Guard fulfills this law enforcement role in naval operations. It provides Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs) to Navy vessels, where they perform arrests and other law enforcement duties during Navy boarding and interdiction missions. In times of war, or when directed by the President, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy and is subject to the orders of the Secretary of the Navy until it is transferred back to the Department of Homeland Security. At other times, Coast Guard Port Security Units are sent overseas to guard the security of ports and other assets. The Coast Guard also jointly staffs the Navy's Naval Coastal Warfare Groups and Squadrons (the latter of which were known as Harbor Defense Commands until late-2004), which oversee defense efforts in foreign littoral combat and inshore areas. Additionally, Coast Guard and Navy vessels sometimes operate together in search and rescue operations.

Emerald starling

The emerald starling ("Lamprotornis iris") is also known as the iris glossy starling. It is a small starling with a metallic green crown, upper body, wings and tail. The ear-coverts and underparts are metallic purple. Both sexes are similar. Most taxonomists unite it with many other glossy-starlings in "Lamprotornis", while others place it in a monotypic genus Coccycolius.
One of the smallest species among starlings, the emerald starling is distributed in West Africa. It inhabits lowlands and savanna of Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea and Sierra Leone. 
The emerald starling feeds on figs, Haronga berries and other fruit, seeds, ants and other small insects. The cup-shaped nest is built in a tree cavity. The male and female cooperate in building the nest from leaves, and both bring food to chicks after they hatch. Females possess a brood patch—a spot on their stomach lacking feathers—that helps them transfer body heat to their eggs.
It is classified as "data deficient" by the IUCN. This means that it is unlikely to be seriously threatened with extinction, but that its status in the wild is in need of assessment. In the emerald starling's case, it appears that the species is plentiful enough for the time being, but that it seems that a considerable and possibly unsustainable number of birds being caught for the cage bird trade (BirdLife International 2004). The "data deficient" status has been upheld since 2000 (BirdLife International 2007), indicative of the prolonged wars and unrest in its range which have thus far prevented comprehensive field studies.

Vista-United Telecommunications

Vista-United Telecommunications was the telecommunications company created to service all Disney resorts in Florida and Disney-planned communities such as Celebration, Florida and the Disney Vacation Clubs in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina and Vero Beach, Florida.
Disney created Vista-United as an Limited Liability Company. The company was created to manage the new telephone and data communications for Walt Disney World. Vista-United was the first company to use underground cabling, the first to use fiber optic cable to provide service to customers, and the first company in Florida to activate 9-1-1 emergency dialing. 
Vista-United was, in fact, an independent telephone company for Walt Disney World, however the company was created through a partnership between Vista Communications, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company and United Telephone Company of Florida, which later became a part of Sprint. 
In 2001 telephone company Smart City Telecom purchased Vista-United and created an agreement with Disney to ensure telecommunications service for the resort over a long period of time.

Paraspeckle

In anatomy, a paraspeckle is an irregularly shaped compartment of the cell, approximately 0.2-1 μm in size, found in the nucleus' interchromatin space. First documented in HeLa cells, where there are generally 10-30 per nucleus, paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells, transformed cell lines and tissue sections. Their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus; the "para" is short for parallel and the "speckle" refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity. Their function is not known, but they may localize proteins in the nucleus.
Localization.
Paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent. All five of the proposed protein components have RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and, in the absence of RNA polymerase II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated proponents form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase because, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap. The localization patterns were also duplicated in experiments using transcription inhibiting drugs.
Function.
The function of the paraspeckle nuclear domain, as a whole, is still not well understood. It has been postulated that the activity of p54nrb, a protein component, is dependent on its localization. It is therefore possible that the paraspeckle's role is to provide ordered localization of its component proteins and to thereby help direct their activity. It has also been suggested that the paraspeckle contributes to transcriptional regulation. Neither of these hypotheses, however, is universally accepted and therefore insight into the paraspeckle's larger role must be derived from the function of its protein components (PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2 and possibly CFI(m)68 and PSF).
The function of PSP1, the protein whose localization pattern led to the discovery of the paraspeckle, is not well understood. Myojin et al. speculated that PSP1, which is highly concentrated in the testis, may regulate the germ cells' early mRNA processing and assist in chromatin remodeling and nuclear shaping during spermatogenesis. PSP1 also forms a dimer with the second protein component: p54nrb. P54nrb has reported involvement in numerous nuclear events including "transcriptional regulation, splicing, DNA unwinding, nuclear retention of hyperedited dsRNA, viral RNA processing, control and cell proliferation, and circadian rhythm maintenance". The final confirmed component, PSP2, is involved in RNA splicing and coactivates hormone receptors.
Later studies have led to the identification of two additional proteins that are likely components of the paraspeckle. In 2004 Dettwiler et al. revealed CFI(m)68 as a possible component of the paraspeckle. CFI(m)68 has been implicated with the preliminary step in pre-mRNA 3' end splicing. Fox et al.'s 2005 article also contains evidence of a possible fifth protein component of the paraspeckle: PSF. PSF can bind both RNA and DNA and interacts with pre-mRNA splicing proteins that work in conjunction with proteins like CFI(m)68. It can dimerize with p54nrb. Furthermore, it colocalizes with PSP1 both in the paraspeckle and, if in the presence of transcription inhibiting drugs, in the same perinucleolar cap. If PSF is in fact part of the paraspeckle that would help further substantiate an assertion by Myojin, et al. that paraspeckle components may participate in pre-mRNA splicing.
In 2005 a new role for paraspeckles in a novel method for controlling gene expression was reported by Prasanth et al. In this study, a nuclear enriched non-coding RNA (termed CTNRNA) was identified that specifically localised to paraspeckles in the nuclei of several cell types. The group found that the RNA was retained in the nucleus at paraspeckles, and was associated with the paraspeckle proteins P54nrb and PSP1, likely through direct interactions between the proteins and motifs in the 3' untranslated (3' UTR) region of the RNA. The CTN non-coding RNA is a longer transcript produced from a gene that also encodes the membrane protein MCAT2, a cationic amino acid transporter. When cells became stressed, the nuclear non-coding RNA levels were reduced, coupled with an increase in cytoplasmic signal for the MCAT2 mRNA and protein. This led the authors to speculate that the paraspeckles were effectively a storage site for the spliced and processed CTN RNA, that were able to release the RNA in a functional protein-encoding form when the cell received a signal. This shorter form was then free to be transported to the cytoplasm and used as a template for protein production. This 'Rapid Release Nuclear Retention mechanism' is thought to save the cell 25 minutes in the production of the mCAT2 protein, as the RNA has already been transcribed, processed and spliced whilst it is being held in the paraspeckles.
Future research.
Though much about the paraspeckle—including its function—remains unknown, the sub-organelle provides a model of the dynamic nature and of the spatial organization of the nucleus. Better understanding this may lead to therapies for molecular diseases caused by mis-organization of nuclear protein.

<doc id="9906668" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9906668" title="Tracy Kenpo">
Tracy Kenpo

Tracy's Kenpo is a Kenpo martial arts style with historical roots through Ed Parker back to William Chow and James Mitose.
Origins.
Kenpo is an unarmed fighting style that came to Japan from China around the twelfth century. Kenpo continued to evolve separately in both countries over the centuries. The Tracy's Kenpo style derives from the Japanese branch, brought to America through Hawaii by James Mitose. Mitose began teaching kenpo to family members in Hawaii in 1936. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Mitose began to teach Kenpo Jiu-Jitsu more openly and, for the first time, outside his family and to students outside the Japanese community. A student, William K.S. Chow, opened a kenpo karate studio in Hawaii. One of his more notable students, Ed Parker (founder of American Kenpo) moved to the mainland United States, and was the kenpo instructor of Al and Jim Tracy, the Tracy brothers.
Tracy's Kenpo was founded by the Tracy Brothers, Al and Jim. The Tracy brothers began their martial arts training in fencing, boxing, and wrestling. They embarked on their study of Kenpo with Ed Parker and his black belt student James Ibrao in 1957, while attending Pasadena City College.{*Jim Tracy} Over time they developed a close relationship with Parker, and soon after Parker turned the teaching of all beginner and intermediate classes over to the brothers. They developed an order in which the techniques would be taught; the advanced classes were run by Ibrao.
Opening Their Studios and Systematizing Their Style.
In the spring of 1962, the Tracy brothers opened their first studio in San Francisco, which they named the Kenpo Karate Studio. As the northern branch of Ed Parker’s organization, it was there that the Tracy brothers created the three new Kyu ranks and the Kenpo "colored belt system". They sorted the techniques into groups of 40 and divided the white belt into four levels instead of two. There would be two katas per belt. The color system for belts was due in part to the availability of belts from Japanese distributors.
As stated on their website, ""But what would we use as the 4th color? Our suppliers from Japan contacted us with an offer for 'orange' belts that had come about as a mistake in the dying process. Originally we would never have considered an "Orange" belt.- Back then we were all pretty 'macho' - and what adult male would wear an Orange Belt? As fate would have it, they offered us such low price on over 1000 orange belts we could not turn it down."" 
Ultimately, the colored belt system became: Orange Belt - Shichikyu; Purple Belt - Rokkyu; Blue Belt - Gokyu; Green Belt - Yonkyu. Later, the Tracys added a Yellow Belt - Hachikyu - as a Youth Belt, with 10 self defense techniques as opposed to 40 for other belts. Ed Parker rejected the colored belts until finally converting to the Tracy color belt system in 1966. The Tracy brothers also created belt manuals (which contained 40 techniques per belt at that time) and gave the techniques names, like "Attacking Circle", "Raising the Staff", etc.
The Tracy brothers opened a second school, in Sacramento, in 1962, and a third, in San Jose, California, in 1963. They later changed the name of the schools to Tracy’s Kenpo Karate. Ed Parker turned the Kenpo Karate Association of America (KKAA) over to the Tracy brothers and then formed the International Kenpo Karate Association (IKKA). The Tracy brothers agreed to join the IKKA on the condition that they could keep the teaching standards of the KKAA for their own students.
Ed Parker promoted Al Tracy to 3rd degree black belt on December 4, 1964. The certificate is from the IKKA and is signed by Ed Parker, Mills Crenshaw, Stan Hall, and Charles Sullivan, and witnessed by Charlotte Connor, the wife of Tom Connor.
The Tracy brothers later opened more schools throughout California and other states, forming Tracy’s International Studios of Self-Defense. By 1982, Ed Parker had changed the Kenpo he had originally learned and taught so much as to make it, in Parker’s own words, "no more than 10% Kenpo", so that he changed the name to American Kenpo. It was around this time that the Tracys completely broke from Ed Parker. Some students stayed with one group and others with the other; Jay T. Will, a noted martial arts referee, held high ranks from both groups.
Tracy's Kenpo Karate today teaches what they describe as "Original, Traditional" Kenpo, as taught to Al and Jim Tracy by Ed Parker, and to Will Tracy by William Chow and Fusae Oshita. Al Tracy and Ted Sumner, the senior black belt in the organization, have spent many years and considerable resources researching the history of the Kenpo system, tracing its roots from the Yoshida family of Japan to its present western incarnations. Tracy's International Studios of Self Defense is a worldwide organization of over 1,000 schools, based out of Lexington, Kentucky. It is the largest system of affiliated schools and the longest-running self-defense chain in the world.
In February 1999, Al Tracy organized the “Gathering of Eagles”, the largest gathering of Kenpoists in the world, which took place in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Gathering brought together over seventy masters, representing Kenpo, American Kenpo, Shaolin Kenpo, Wun Hop Kuen Do, Lima Lama, Kajukenbo and included some of the biggest names in Westernized Kenpo. James Ibrao, Thomas Mitose, the son of the late James Mitose, Roger Greene, Ted Sumner, Ray Arquilla, Al Dacascos, Ralph and Rob Castro, William Chun, Jr., Sonny Gascon, Bart Vale, Larry Tatum, Adriano Emperado, Richard Lee, Sig Kufferath, Tino Tuiolosega, and John McSweeney all attended. Between 1100-1200 people attended the event, coming from all over the globe, with a choice of five seminars at any one time and eighty overall.
The second Gathering took place in 2001 and was attended by approximately 1500-1600 people. The event also included the son of Choki Motobu, Chosei Motobu, Koshiro Tanaka, Ron Sanchez, Steve Labounty, and Bob White.
In June 2007, Tracy's International Studios of Self Defense hosted the 3rd Gathering of Eagles and the inaugural induction ceremony for the International Kenpo Hall of Fame. A list of Charter Member Inductees may be found by following the link.
In 2006, Al Tracy was featured on the cover of ""Art of the Warrior" Magazine," under the heading, "Grandmaster Al Tracy, Founder of the world's largest system of Kenpo, renowned Kenpo historian, and business scholar." "Black Belt Magazine" named Tracy's Kenpo 10th degree black belt and founder of the ""International Shootfighting Association"," Bart Vale, its 2006 Full Contact Fighter of the Year.
In 2013, Al Tracy hosted the 4th Gathering of Eagles and International Kenpo Hall of Fame. At this event, Grandmaster Tracy awarded 11 of his senior students the rank of ""Judan" (10th degree black belt). He also presented his top instructors with the Spirit of the Warrior Award, which came with the expectation of these instructors carrying on the legacy of the Tracy System. Thirty-eight (38) new members were inducted into the International Kenpo Hall of Fame.

Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves

Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves () are partly natural and partly artificial caves of archaeological, historical and religious importance near the city of Bhubaneswar in Odisha, India. The caves are situated on two adjacent hills, Udayagiri and Khandagiri, mentioned as "Kumari Parvat" in the Hathigumpha inscription. They have a number of finely and ornately carved caves. It is believed that most of these caves were carved out as residential blocks for Jain monks during the reign of King Kharavela. Udayagiri means "Sunrise Hill" and has 18 caves while Khandagiri has 15 caves. 
The caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri, called "lena" or "leṇa" in the inscriptions, were dug out mostly during the reign of Kharavela for the abode of Jaina ascetics. The most important of this group is Ranigumpha in Udayagiri which is a double storeyed monastery.
Count of the caves.
B.M. Barua, based on a reading of line 14 of the Hathigumpha inscription, declared that a total of 117 caves were excavated by Kharavela and others on the Kumari hill (Udayagiri). Marshall has counted more than 35 caves in both the hills, while M.M. Ganguli has enumerated only 27 caves. 
The number of existing caves at Udayagiri is 18, while Khandagiri has 15. The local names of the existing caves are listed below, numbered according to the enumeration of the Archaeological Survey of India.
The famous caves.
In Udayagiri, Hathigumpha (cave 14) and Ganeshagumpha (cave 10) are especially well known due to art treasures of their sculptures and reliefs as well as due to their historical importance. "Rani ka Naur" (Queen's Palace cave, cave 1) is also an extensively carved cave and elaborately embellished with sculptural friezes. Khandagiri offers a fine view back over Bhubaneswar from its summit. The Ananta cave (cave 3) depicts carved figures of women, elephants, athletes, and geese carrying flowers.
Inscriptions in Caves in Brahmi.
Hathigumpha inscription.
The Hathigumpha cave ("Elephant Cave") has the Hathigumpha inscription, written by Raja Kharavela, the king of Kalinga in India, during the 2nd century BCE. The Hathigumpha inscription consists of seventeen lines incised in deep cut Brahmi letters on the overhanging brow of a natural cavern Hathigumpha in the south side of the Udayagiri hill. It faces the rock edicts of Asoka at Dhauli, situated about six miles away.
Other minor inscriptions.
Besides Hathigumpha Inscription of Kharavela, there are some other minor Brahmi inscriptions in the twin hillocks of Udayagiri and Khandagiri, which were deciphered earlier by Prof RD Banergy during 1915-16 (Epigraphic Indica-XIII) and BM Baraua (Indian Historical Quarterly-XIV). Sadananda Agrawal has given further clarifications about them and are produced as under:
I- Mancapuri cave inscription (Upper storey) 
This inscription is engraved on the raised space between the second and third doorways of the cave. The text in Devanagari script is as under:
L.1- अरहंत पसादाय कलिंगानं समनानं लेनं कारितं राजिनो ललाकस
L.2- हथिसिहस पपोतस धुतुना कलिंग चकवतिनो सिरिखारवेलस
L.3- अगमहिसिना कारितं
Translation - By the blessings of Arhats, the chief queen of Kharavela, the Cakravarti monarch of Kalinga, the great granddaughter of Hathisiha (Hasti Simha) and the daughter of Lalāka or Lalārka caused to be excavated the cave for the sramanas of Kalinga.
II- Mancapuri cave inscription (Upper storey)-A
This inscription is incised on a raised bend between the 3rd and 4th doorways from the left and contains single line. The text in Devanagari script is as under:
Translation - This is the cave of Aira Mahameghavahana
Maharaja Kudepasiri, the overlord of Kalinga.
Note:- Kudepasiri seems to be the immediate successor of Kharavela. 
III-Manchapuri cave inscription 'B' (Lower storey)
This inscription has been engraved on the right wall of Veranda, to the right of the entrance to the right-hand side chamber of the main wing, consisting of one line. The text in Devanagari script is as under:
Translation - is the cave of Prince .
Note:- On palaeographic ground Prof Banergy considers this inscription to be a little earlier than the inscription of King Kudepasiri. According to Sadananda Agrawal, Prince Badukha stands an obscure figure in history, but Badukha seems to be the son or brother of Kudepasiri.
IV- Inscriptions in the Sarpagumpha (Over the door way) 
This inscription consisting of one line, is incised over the doorway of the Sarpagumpha. The text in Devanagari script is as under:
Translation - The chamber and veranda/or side chamber of cūlakama.
Note:- However Dr. Sahu interpreted Ajeya being united by a "Sandhi" qualifying Koṭha there by denoting invincible. But he ignored the conjunction "ca (Devanagari: च)" which follows "Koṭha(Devanagari:कोठा)" and "Jeya (Devanagari:जेया)". 
V- Inscription in the Sarpagumpha ( to the left of the doorway) 
The text in Devanagari script is as under:
L.1- कंमस हलखि
L.2- णय च पसादो
Translation :- pavilion is the gift of Kamma and Halakhina. 
Note:- Most probably Halakhiṇa was the wife of Kamma. "Chūlakamma" - found in the inscription No.IV and "Kamma" of this record indicate official designations rather than the proper names. "Kamma" may be taken as minister of works ("Karma saciva") and "Cūlakamma" appears to be a junior cadre of minister in the Department of works. 
VI- Haridas cave inscription
This inscription contains one line has been incised over one of the three entrances to the main chamber of the cave from the veranda. The text in Devanagari script is as under:
Translation :- The chamber and veranda (or side chamber) are the gift of cūlakama. 
VII- Vyāghragumphā inscription
The record is incised on the outer wall of the inner chamber. The text in Devanagari script is as under:
L.1- नगर अखंदस
L.2- स भूतिनो लेणं
Translation :- The cave of Bhūti, the city judge.
VIII- Jambesavara cave inscription 
This inscription has been engraved over the entrances to the inner chamber of the cave. The text in Devanagari script is as under:
Translation :- The cave of Mahamāda Nākiya and Bāriyā. 
X- Tatowāgumphā inscription (Cave No -1) 
The record of this inscription is incised over one of the entrances to the inner chamber. The Text reads in Sanskrit as 
पादमुलिकस कुसुमस लेणं x [।।]
Translation: The cave of Kusuma, the "padamulika".
Notes:- There is a syllable after the word "lenam", which may be read as "ni" or "phi". "padamulika" literally means, one who serves at the feet king.
According to Kishori Lal Faujdar, Here Kusuma seems to be related with Kaswan clan of Jats. He refers an article ‘Hathi Gumpha and three other inscriptions’ (page 24) in Devanagari as under: 
Translation:- This translates that the city of 'Masikanagara ' was obtained with the help of 'Kuswan' Kshatriyas.
Note:- Sadananda Agrawal has interpreted "Masikanagara" as "Asikanagara" and identified with the city Adam (Nagpur district). In view of the evidence of a highly prosperous city unearthed at Adam, Prof AM Shastri is of the opinion that Adam itself represents the Asikanagara of Hathigumpha inscription. It is worth noting in the present context that a terracotta sealing having a legend, has been discovered from Adam, situated on the right bank of the river Wainganga, which reads Asakajanapadasa (Devanagari: असकजनपदस). 
XI- Ananta Gumpha inscription (A) 
The record is incised on the architrave between the left ante and the fifth pillar. The text in Oriya script is:
Translation :- The cave of the Dohada .
List of Caves at Khandagiri.
The above nomenclature has no historical significance but is accepted at present for the convenience of scholars and general readers. The art of Udayagiri and Khandagiri, being almost contemporaneous with that of Sanchi, has a striking resemblance to it but at the same time retains its own individuality and advanced technique.

George W. Woodruff

George Waldo Woodruff (August 27, 1895 - February 4, 1987 in Atlanta, Georgia) was an engineer, businessman, and philanthropist in Atlanta, Georgia. He attended the Georgia School of Technology in 1917 and gave generously to both his alma mater and Emory University, including (in coordination with his brother Robert W. Woodruff) what was at the time the single largest donation ever to a school, $105 million to Emory University in 1979.
Early life.
Woodruff went to high school at Tech High School (now Henry W. Grady High School) and attended Georgia Tech's School of Mechanical Engineering and later the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but left school in 1917 due to World War I. At Georgia Tech, he was a brother of the Kappa Alpha Order.
Career.
From 1936 to 1985 (49 years), Woodruff was the director of the Coca-Cola Company, although he was never an officer of the company. He also headed the Continental Gin Company from 1930 to 1985, which was a cotton-processing business. George was the last living child of Ernest Woodruff, the magnate that led the Trust Company (now known as SunTrust) and who orchestrated the takeover of the Coca-Cola Company. In 1984, Forbes Magazine estimated that Woodruff was worth $200 million ($ today).
Legacy.
Woodruff is the namesake of several notable educational programs in Georgia. The George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech is the university's oldest and second-largest school; it was named for Woodruff in 1985 on the school's centennial. Also at Georgia Tech, the Woodruff Dining Hall is the only dining hall on west campus. Woodruff left the Georgia Tech Foundation $37.5 million in his will, one of the largest private gifts the school has received. 
Woodruff is remembered at Mercer University as well. He bequeathed the university's law school a $15 million endowment; the Woodruff Curriculum at Mercer's Walter F. George School of Law is named in his honor. At Emory, the George W. Woodruff Physical Education Center and the George and Irene Woodruff Residential Center bear his name. Finally, there are numerous scholarships at Georgia Tech, Mercer, Emory and the University of Georgia named in his memory.

Ermengol II, Count of Urgell

Ermengol (or Armengol) II (died 1038), called the Pilgrim, was the Count of Urgell from 1011 to his death. He was the son of Ermengol I. He was a child when he succeeded his father and was put under the regency of his uncle Raymond Borrel of Barcelona until 1018. Ermengol went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and died in 1038 at Jerusalem.
With his uncle's help, Armengol began a successful war of reconquest to the south, taking Montmagastre, Alòs, Malagastre, Rubió, and Artesa. Around 1015, the bishop of Urgell, Armengol, repopulated the region of Guissona. Finally, Arnau Mir de Tost occupied the castle of Àger in 1034. The taifa kings of Lleida and Zaragoza also granted lands to him and to the church of Urgel.
He married before November 24, 1031, Constança, also called Velasquita. She survived until 1059 at least and acted as regent for her son Ermengol III. She may have been the homonymous daughter of Count Bernard I of Besalu and Countess Tota-Adelaide, named in her father's will in October 1021.

He has worked on over a dozen films, but is perhaps best known for his three collaborations with Coleman Francis in the 1960s: "The Beast of Yucca Flats", "The Skydivers", and "Night Train To Mundo Fine" (also known as "Red Zone Cuba"). Before becoming involved in the film industry, Cardoza was a welder – a trade he continued making a living from for a number of years into his show business career. However, in 1963 a doctor advised him to stop welding because of chalazion forming under his eyelids.

CBS Sports Spectacular

CBS Sports Spectacular is a sports anthology program produced by CBS Sports. The series began on January 3, 1960 as "The CBS Sports Spectacular", and has been known under many different names, including CBS Sports Saturday, CBS Sports Sunday, Eye on Sports and The CBS Sports Show. 
The program continues to air on an irregular basis on weekend afternoons, especially during the late spring and summer months. Normally it airs pre-recorded "time-buy" sports events produced by outside companies, such as supercross or skiing competitions, or sponsored documentaries.
Hosts.
Hosts have included John "Bud" Palmer, Jack Whitaker, Brent Musburger, Pat Summerall Jim Kelly, Dick Stockton, Tim Brant, Greg Gumbel, Pat O'Brien, Andrea Joyce and Michele Tafoya.
Under its current format, the program does not have a regular host.
Theme music.
An original composition by Edd Kalehoff featuring scat vocals was used as the theme for "The CBS Sports Spectacular" beginning in 1970. Then, The Electric Light Orchestra's "Fire on High" was used as the theme of the show (when it was known as "The CBS Sports Special") from 1976 to 1978. The next song used as a theme (from 1979-1980) was an "in-house" version of American composer Aaron Copland's symphonic instrumental "Fanfare For The Common Man." The CBS version of "Fanfare" – clocking in at 1 minute, eight seconds—was styled after the 9 minute, 40 second version recorded by UK progressive rock group Emerson, Lake & Palmer on its 1977 LP, "Works Volume 1".
For CBS' Super Bowl XVI coverage at the end of the 1981 NFL season, CBS' theme music would eventually become the theme for "CBS Sports Saturday/Sunday". The music itself, could be considered a hybrid of the then, "NFL Today" theme and their original college basketball theme.

Wintun Glacier

The Wintun Glacier is a glacier situated on the eastern flank of Mount Shasta, in the U.S. state of California. It is both the third largest and third most voluminous glacier in California after the neighboring Hotlum Glacier and the Whitney Glacier. The Wintun Glacier starts on the east side of Mount Shasta's main summit, and it has the highest permanent snow and ice on the mountain, reaching above to within a few dozen feet (~8–15 m) of the true summit. The glacier flows east down a steep slope and terminates in two lobes, the longer of which extends down near .
In 2002, scientists made the first detailed survey of Mount Shasta's glaciers in 50 years. They found that seven of the glaciers have grown over the period 1951-2002, with the Hotlum and Wintun Glaciers nearly doubling, the Bolam Glacier increasing by half, and the Whitney and Konwakiton Glaciers growing by a third.

William Lang (athlete)

William Lang (born about 1838) was a professional British runner, who set world records in numerous running events in the 1860s, including a mile record which stood for 16 years.
In the 1850s and 1860s, with the advent of accurate timing devices and precisely measured running courses, the sport of running, called "pedestrianism," became extremely popular, especially in Britain.
On 19 August 1865, the greatest field of milers ever assembled to that time raced at the Royal Oak Grounds in Manchester for the Mile Championship Cup, ₤30, and title of "Champion Miler of the World." Included in the field of nine professionals were Siah Albison, who had set a mile record at the same location in 1860 at 4:22¼, Lang who had broken Albison's record in 1863, and Edward Mills, the current record holder in the event at 4:20, set on 25 June 1864 also at Manchester.
Lang was nicknamed the "Crowcatcher" and had set records in the two mile and six mile events in 1863. He had also run the mile in 4:21¾ that year and was eager to win this race.
A crowd of 15,000 watched the race, which also included Scot Robert McInstray, world-record holder in the 880-yard race, 4:21½ miler James Sanderson, the Welsh mile champion William Richards and half-miler rabbit James Nuttall. As bets were being placed, word came through that Mills was limping and would not be able to compete, meaning that Lang was now the clear favourite.
Nuttall led the field around the 651-yard track and hit the quarter-mile mark in 60 seconds, an unsustainable pace. The crowd cheered, and excitement built as Nuttall hit the half in 2:05½. Nuttall started to fade, and Lang took over the lead and at the 3/4 mile point with a time of 3:14, which the crowd realized was fast enough to make this the first-ever mile run under 4:20.
As Lang headed into the backstretch, he tried to pull away, but McInstray kept pace as did the previously unheralded Richards. Albion had faded badly and was no longer a factor. As the three came onto the homestretch, the crowd roared, and McInstray lost ground. Richards, on the other hand, gained on Lang. At the finish, Richards pulled even and he and Lang crossed the line together. Though Lang's supporters howled with rage, the judges ruled the race a tie.
Their time was 4:17¼, a time not surpassed until William Cummings ran 4:16 16 years later.
Because the public was not satisfied with a tie, a run-off was held a week later, and Lang beat Richards in 4:22.

Elmira District Secondary School

__NOTOC__
Elmira District Secondary School (EDSS) is the high school serving the town of Elmira, Ontario, Canada and the surrounding area.
Continuation school.
The first secondary education in Elmira was a "continuation school" that began in 1896. Classes were held in one room in a public school and continued for only a short time. Education until that point in Elmira stopped at grade eight. Interest declined in the classes and higher education stopped for a period of time. In 1908, another attempt was made to again begin classes for a continuation group, but again stopped shortly after in December 1910. Three years later the trustees were asked to try again. On September 6, 1914, under the principalship of Alma Crawforth of Whitby, Ontario, the continuation school started once more. It resided in an unoccupied class in Riverside Public School. The second year a second teacher, Margaret MacDonald was added due to the success of the programme.
Transportation to the school for some was by train. The first graduating class was in June 1917. Twelve students passed the middle school or grade 12 examinations. It was written that the cost of maintenance per pupil in 1928 was $50 per year.
Building the new high school.
On January 6, 1924 the High School Board made a motion that the option held on the , 21 town lots, be accepted. Six days later the declaration of the purchase was made. Apparently, this land was owned by a Mr. Edward Beir. Later it was revealed that not three, but were actually purchased for the school site. It is not clear whether someone like F. W. Warren, the architect, Oscar Wiles, the contractor or some other citizen made a motion to obtain another .
This piece of property was a section originally purchased by Mr. Edward Bristow in 1832. It was a solid timber forest. Mr. Bristow originally paid one dollar an acre to Mr. David Musselman. Mr. Bristow was the first settler and henceforth Elmira's former name of Bristow's Corners acknowledged this. The funds for the purchase of the land were handed to the board by the town council in May. The Public School Board provided an additional room in order to meet the demand for more space which would be needed when the school would be opened.
Before the sod was turned in June 1938, fourteen years had passed since the original land purchase. This delay can be attributed to many factors. The war boom showed signs of recession and the Board became cautious. Initial pressure from the Education Department became less insistent. Accommodations at the present High School (Continuation School) were being met. The first chairman of the first official High School Board, George Klinck, turned the sod an June 28, 1938 for the new school. R.H. Vice, present chairman of the School Board laid the cornerstone, July 21, 1938.
The original cost of the school was approximately $188,080. According to the book "The Development and Progress of Education in Elmira and Vicinity" George Klinck describes the school in the following manner: "It's distinguished, classical and dignified appearance, its favourable position which admits plenty of room on all sides, its solidity and durability, its freedom from questionable and perishable decorations, and its unresistable attractiveness" added to the outstanding features of the school. The school grounds as described by the same author state" of rich clay loam, about of which is reserved for experimental instruction purposes. The remainder will be used for play and recreation plots. The trustees have, wisely, consulted a professional landscape artist who has submitted a plan. There will be planted a variety of fruit, shade and forest trees, shrubs and flowers in accordance with the artist's plans, as soon as the season opens. The gym was regarded as 'one of the most attractive rooms in the school.' It provided the community with one more possible venue for civic gatherings. The general shop was seen to be a remarkable addition to the school. Klinck states that it "will be enthusiastically welcomed by the boys who are gifted with mechanical and utilitarian proclivities Combinations of practicability with academic education is the ideal goal for the ambitions of a practical matter of fact community. Parents should realize this and give their boys and girls a chance."
The school was officially opened on December 8, 1938 by the Hon. Dr. Simpson, Minister of Education.
Early days.
Some of the courses taught were General Academics, Junior Matriculation, Upper School in French, Latin and German, English History, Biology, Mathematics, Commercial Course, General Shop and Mechanics, Farm Mechanics, Woodworking, Sheet Metal, and Machine Drafting.
The principal was R.R. Mansz. The teachers were Mr. E.W. Kendall, Miss E. Cruickshanks, Miss D. Legree, Miss L.M. Bell, and Miss C. McDonagh.
Post-war.
In his booklet "The Development of Secondary Education in the Elmira District", former principal H. B. Disbrowe writes: "it was soon after the end of the war that demand for equality of educational opportunity led to the establishment of the first enlarged high school districts."
In 1947 there were lengthy negotiations between the councils of the town of Elmira and the townships of Woolwich, Wellesley, and Peel. As a result of these talks it was agreed to dissolve the old Elmira High School Board and establish a new Elmira District High School Board. The new board assumed office in January 1948 and the school became known by a new name, "Elmira District High School."
In 1948, classes were considered to be large. A typical grade 9 class had 41 pupils and a grade 13 class had 40 pupils. Discipline was tight and was expected and respected by parents.
The school song was "EHS Is Supreme Throughout The Land!" School colours were blue and white, and for gym students wore navy tunics with white blouses, socks and gym shoes "without fail" or they lost valuable marks for being late in the gym and being improperly attired. The school team was the Blue Bombers. Around 1950, the school colours were changed to green and gray. Students made their own green corduroy shorts in Home Ec and bought gray shiny t-shirts with green trim.
In the early 1950s a social event for the school was Teen Town. Young ladies wore Gibson girl blouses (white) with black kerchiefs tied under the collar to make a bow at the front, and black gored skirts with crinoline slips holding them out; and ankle socks and saddle shoes.
In 1954 at a cost of $149,990. a four room addition was constructed. At this point there were 275 students in attendance. The architect for this project was R.C. Reider of Kitchener. Wunder Construction of Kitchener was granted the tender for $136,848. After miscellaneous expenses were added on, the total came $18.00 short of the limit the board would spend of $158,800.
In 1959, ten to twelve rooms and another gymnasium were added due to growth in enrollment. (the number of rooms varies with different written accounts.) This last addition contained a laboratory, classrooms and a lady teacher's room. The new gym would be used by the boys and the older gym by the girls. The basement also included a new industrial arts classroom. The cost of this addition was $488,008 and gave an 85% increase in space.
1960s.
The new addition was officially opened at the end of April 1960 by Dr. S.D. Rendall, Superintendent of Secondary Education for Ontario. In his speech to nearly 900, Rendall said that nearly 60 out of every 100 students who got to high school never graduate.
Cadet inspection was a major event in the early 1960s. Everyone male and female, unless he/she had a religious exemption or was in Grade 13, was required to participate. The guys wore wool uniforms and the girls wore blazers. The cadets marched down Snyder Avenue, along Church Street, and back up Arthur Street before inspection. Participants got off classes to practice and after inspection, the evening ended up being quite a big event with a dance at the end.
Teen Town was a regular event and well attended. Ernie Kendall was the sponsor and kept things on the "up and up." (Some will remember the year that Ernie tried to limit the close dancing by going out on the floor with a ruler to measure the distance between heads.far apart were they supposed to be?)
In 1963, a vocational wing was added on. This addition was perceived by the board as a move that was long overdue. It felt that the courses that were offered at that time were mainly geared 10 help prepare students for university entrance. These new programmes that would be available would better prepare a student with marketable skills for the job force. At that point in Canadian history, the market for unskilled labourers was rapidly diminishing due to automation in industry and its rapid growth.
Valued at approximately $480,080. the new addition provided additional extensions to the existing facilities, an agricultural greenhouse, an electrical or carpentry shop, a drafting room, an automotive shop, a machine shop, and three classrooms.
The entire addition and equipment were covered by a full grant with the Federal Government providing 75% and the Provincial Government 25%.
The name of the school was changed to Elmira District Secondary School at the opening on January 17 and 18, 1963. Minister of Labor Charles Starr and O. W. (Mike) Weichel M.P. for Waterloo North were invited as guests of honour.
The school curriculum now included Arts and Science, Business and Commerce, and Science, Technology and Trades. Within each branch there were five year courses and four year courses. In addition there were also occupational courses for boys and girls who only have one or two years to spend at school. The new Technical wing was the most up-to-date building of its kind in Ontario. It contained a Technical Director's office, Drafting Room, Machine Shop, Electrical Shop, Automotive Shop, Diversified Trades Shop, Greenhouse, Industrial Sewing Room, Nursing Room, Business Machines Room, Typing Room and Classrooms.
H.B. Disbrowe, principal, felt that the changes in the secondary school programme, which were being implemented in Elmira, were the most sweeping to occur in Ontario.
All this has sprung forth from a continuation school which started in 1896. Many people contributed to the education in Elmira. As George Klinck wrote, "Suffice it to state that the school stands as a tribute to the dutifulness and enterprise of the citizens of the town, to the ability of the architect and to the skill of the contractors and their helpers. May it long stand."
2000s.
In 2006, the school began to remove asbestos from the walls and ceilings of the school, and added an elevator - luckily - apparently, the old part of the school was built on dirt, with no foundation beneath, so before the elevator was installed by Delta Elevators, a foundation was poured. The construction is finally over and the artworks are going back up on the walls. Another new piece of information is that the school has bought a piece of land across the street, formerly the Elmira Raceway, and now has a new sports field including a new track and field facility. There is also a large scoreboard at the new field.
School song.
EDSS School Song (sung to the tune of Anchors Aweigh)
EDSS is supreme, throughout the land.
Ever by EDSS we promise that we’ll stand, stand, stand.
Striving the right to do, we’ll never shy.
Always to do our best and lift the banners, lift the banners high!
"Cheer"
Somebody, anybody, everybody roar!
Elmira High School loyal to the core!
Rissity, rassity, riss, rass, rass!!
Elmira High School, Yes! Yes! Yes!

Post-independence Burma, 1948–62

The first years of Burmese independence were marked by successive insurgencies by the Red Flag Communists led by Thakin Soe, the White Flag Communists led by Thakin Than Tun, the "Yèbaw Hpyu" (White-band PVO) led by Bo La Yaung, a member of the Thirty Comrades, army rebels calling themselves the Revolutionary Burma Army (RBA) led by Communist officers Bo Zeya, Bo Yan Aung and Bo Yè Htut - all three of them members of the Thirty Comrades, Arakanese Muslims, and the Karen National Union (KNU). 
Remote areas of northern Burma were for many years controlled by an army of Kuomintang (KMT) forces after the Communist victory in China in 1949. Burma accepted foreign assistance in rebuilding the country in these early years, but continued American support for the Chinese Nationalist military presence in Burma finally resulted in the country rejecting most foreign aid, refusing to join the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and supporting the Bandung Conference of 1955. Burma generally strove to be impartial in world affairs and was one of the first countries in the world to recognize Israel and the People's Republic of China.
By 1958, the country was largely beginning to recover economically, but was beginning to fall apart politically due to a split in the AFPFL into two factions, one led by Thakins Nu and Tin, the other by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein. And this despite the unexpected success of U Nu's 'Arms for Democracy' offer taken up by U Seinda in the Arakan, the Pa-o, some Mon and Shan groups, but more significantly by the PVO surrendering their arms. The situation became very unstable in parliament, with U Nu surviving a no-confidence vote only with the support of the opposition National United Front (NUF), believed to have 'cryptocommunists' amongst them. 
Army hardliners now saw the 'threat' of the CPB coming to an agreement with U Nu through the NUF, and in the end U Nu 'invited' Army Chief of Staff General Ne Win to take over the country. Over 400 'communist sympathisers' were arrested, of which 153 were deported to the Coco Islands in the Andaman Sea. Among them was the NUF leader Aung Than, older brother of Aung San. The "Botahtaung", "Kyemon" and "Rangoon Daily" were also closed down.
Ne Win's caretaker government successfully stabilised the situation and paved the way for new general elections in 1960 that returned U Nu's Union Party with a large majority. The situation did not remain stable for long, when the Shan Federal Movement, started by Nyaung Shwe Sawbwa Sao Shwe Thaik ( the first President of independent Burma 1948-52) and aspiring to a 'loose' federation, was seen as a separatist movement insisting on the government honouring the right to secession in 10 years provided for by the 1947 Constitution.
Ne Win had already succeeded in stripping the Shan Sawbwas of their feudal powers in exchange for comfortable pensions for life in 1959. He staged the 1962 coup d'état on March 2, 1962, arrested U Nu, Sao Shwe Thaik and several others, and declared a 'socialist state' run by a 'Revolutionary Council' of senior military officers. Sao Shwe Thaik's son, Sao Mye Thaik, was shot dead in what was generally described as a 'bloodless' coup. Thibaw Sawbwa Sao Kya Seng also disappeared mysteriously after being stopped at a checkpoint near Taunggyi.

Garuda Indonesia Flight 200

Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 (GA200) was a scheduled domestic passenger flight of a Boeing 737-497 operated by Garuda Indonesia between Jakarta and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The aircraft crashed and burst into flames while landing at Adisucipto International Airport on 7 March 2007. According to the airline, 21 passengers and 1 crew member were killed; both the captain and the first officer survived and were admitted to an Indonesian military hospital.
Aircraft.
The aircraft was a Boeing 737-400, registered as PK-GZC, which had been operated by three airlines, including Aloha Airlines, Star Europe and Jet Airways. The aircraft had a total of 35,157 airframe hours and 37,328 cycles since its first flight on 5 November 1992.
Garuda Indonesia.
Garuda Indonesia was recently noted for its improved safety, having not had a major accident for the past decade. The oldest airline in Indonesia (founded in 1949), Garuda Indonesia had received a number of criticisms in the months surrounding the crash. According to Australian aviation experts, Garuda Indonesia had one of the worst safety records among the world's national carriers. Since 1950, Garuda Indonesia has had 14 major accidents with the most recent in 1997, when Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 crashed 18 miles off Medan Airport in Sumatra, killing all 234 passengers. The managing director of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, Peter Harbison, stated that the major accidents in Indonesian aviation history were all caused by the combinations of airports' and fleets' low safety standards and the poor weather conditions in the area, including severe thunderstorms and other forms of inclement weather.
Flight chronology.
Flight GA200 originated in Jakarta and was carrying 133 passengers, 19 of whom were foreigners. Several Australian journalists were on the flight, covering the visit of Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer and Attorney-General Philip Ruddock to Java. They were on the flight as the aircraft carrying Australian dignitaries were at capacity.
At approximately 7 am local time (UTC+7), while attempting to land at Adisucipto International Airport, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, the plane overran the end of the runway, went through the perimeter fence and stopped in a nearby rice field after it bounced three times. Passengers in the plane and witnesses on the ground reported the plane approached the runway at a speed greater than normal. According to passengers, the plane shook violently before it crashed. At some point the plane caught fire, and while most passengers were able to escape, a number of passengers perished inside the burning fuselage. This may have been caused by the broken main exit door, which is located at the front left. The fire may have been ignited from the nose landing gear after its wheels were snapped off, which were found later on the runway.
The pilot, Captain Muhammad Marwoto Komar, claimed that there was a sudden downdraft immediately before the flight landed, and that the flaps on the aircraft may have malfunctioned.
Aftermath.
One of the passengers was a cameraman for the Australian Seven Network. He escaped from the burning wreckage with his camera and started filming the aftermath. He made a telephone call to inform the network's Sydney newsroom and the footage was beamed back to appear on the 6pm news of that night. This exclusive footage was viewed all over the world. Australian Federal Police agents Brice Steele and Mark Scott, Australian Embassy staffers Liz O'Neill (public relations officer) and Allison Sudradjat (Minister Counsellor and Senior Representative of AusAID), and "Australian Financial Review" newspaper journalist Morgan Mellish were among those killed.
Investigation.
Australia was heavily involved in the investigation in which the Australian Federal Police disaster victim identification experts were deployed to the scene to assist with the identification of bodies. Australian Transport Safety Bureau staff assisted at the scene by inspecting the wreckage to attempt to piece together a picture of the incident. The "black box" recorders consisting of a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were removed from the wreckage and flown to Canberra, Australia, for further analysis by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigations using equipment not yet available in Indonesia. The United States' National Transportation Safety Board dispatched a team to assist in the investigation, including representatives from Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration. Staff in Australia could not read the cockpit voice recorder of the black box, which was then sent to the Boeing factory in Seattle, United States, to be deciphered.
According to the pilots, a huge gust of wind was responsible for the disaster, while witnesses said that the plane was at a higher than normal speed during landing. Police were said to be investigating the possibility of a detonator inside the aircraft, with Police spokesman Budi Santoso saying "About a suspicion of a detonator might have been found inside the ill-fated plane, we are still investigating it. To prove it, it will take a long time, and the police are still collecting evidence both from witnesses' information and from objects found from the plane wreckage,".
After the flight data and black box recordings were analyzed, and a complete safety review of the airport was conducted, it was revealed that the Yogyakarta Airport did not conform to international safety standards, having a runway runoff a quarter the recommended length; pilots reported the reverse thrust of one engine was not working prior to takeoff; the weather was calm, contradicting claims of an updraft; data recordings revealed no mechanical fault before landing; black box recordings revealed there was no cockpit argument, as reported; safety vehicles were unable to reach the crash site in sufficient time, failing to conform to global safety standards.
On 17 March 2007, new evidence from the flight data recorder indicated that wing flaps on the plane were not extended for landing. New evidence came up on 1 April 2007 and it is reported that the pilot and co-pilot were arguing about the plane's speed, but other reports said there was no evidence for this.
On 11 April 2007, Indonesia's National Safety Transport Committee released a preliminary finding into the crash, confirming that Garuda Flight 200 was travelling at around 410 km/h — almost twice the normal speed — when it came in to land. A Garuda Pilots' Association official has speculated that the captain could have been trying to save fuel due to a new fuel conservation bonus scheme recently introduced by Garuda Indonesia.
On 22 October 2007, the official enquiry blamed the crash on pilot error. The captain ignored the plane’s automated warning system as it sounded alarms fifteen times. He also ignored calls from the co-pilot to go around and make another approach.
On 4 February 2008 the captain, Marwoto Komar, was arrested and charged with six counts of manslaughter. The charge carries a penalty up to life imprisonment if the court finds the crash was deliberate. Short of that finding, the lesser charge of negligent flying causing death, carries a maximum sentence of seven-years. The copilot testified that he had told the captain to go around because of excessive speed, and that he then had blacked out due to the severe buffeting.
On 6 April 2009, the captain was found guilty of negligence and sentenced to 2 years in jail.
Despite all evidence pointing towards severe pilot error, the captain's conviction was quashed by the Indonesian High Court on 29 September 2009.
Change of flight number.
Garuda has changed the flight number from GA 200 to GA 202 to avoid superstition or fear based on the flight numbers. GA 200 normally left Jakarta at around 6.15 AM (the first flight out of Jakarta bound for Yogyakarta). GA 202 now leaves at 6am.

WEOW

WEOW, is a commercial radio station broadcasting at 92.7 FM with a CHR/Top 40 branded as "WEOW 92.7" (Pronounced as "wow"). The station is currently owned by Florida Keys Media and is considered the southern-most CHR/Top 40 station in Continental United States. It's 100,000 watt signal covers an area from Key Largo, Fl, to Havana, Cuba.
History.
Early History.
Originally WFYN-FM, this was the Florida Keys' first FM radio station when Gayle Swofford's Florida Keys Broadcasting Corporation began airing on February 20, 1967 at 92.5 FM with a Beautiful Music format. In 1982 the format was updated to Adult Contemporary and in the mid-80s the call sign was changed to WEOW and the station became known as "WOW 92.5".
WEOW 92.5/92.7.
In 1990, WEOW dropped it's Adult Contemporary format for CHR/Top 40 but retained the "Wow 92.5" branding. During this time, the station featured popular personalities such as Chris Wolfe & JR in the Morning and Bill Bravo, who remains to this day. 
In the early 2000's, Clear Channel Communications purchased WEOW and ended up moving the station up the dial to 92.7.
On January 25, 2008, it was announced that WEOW was one of several Clear Channel radio stations to be sold, in order to remain under the ownership caps following the sale of Clear Channel to private investors. The station, along with its sister stations, were put into the Aloha Stations Trust until November 2013 when they were purchased by newly formed Florida Keys Media. The sale was finalized in March 2014 and WEOW began restructuring it's on-air lineup, dropping all of Clear Channel's Premium Choice jocks for live and local talent.
On April 1, 2014, WEOW brought back station vets Rude Girl & Molly Blue for mornings.

German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic

The German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic (DSAP, "Deutsche sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei in der Tschechoslowakischen Republik"; ) was a German social democratic party in Czechoslovakia. It was founded as the Bohemian provincial organization of the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria separated itself from the mother party. The founding convention was held in Teplice in 30 August – 3 September 1919; the first leader of the party was Josef Seliger.
In the First Czechoslovak Republic, DSAP was the most important German party, which aimed at giving the German people a place in the republic. At first the party's leadership was politically and socially radical; the Czechoslovak State was regarded as a "creation of Allies' Imperialism" and the Czechoslovak Constitution as "suicide of democracy". However, these politics were shortly changed as the radical left-wing led by Karl Kreibich left the party (and joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia) in October 1920. Eventually the number of members fallen dramatically in 1921–1926 from 120,000 to 60,000.
Some notable members of the party started talks with President Masaryk who—in vain—tried to persuade the party to join the government. It agreed finally in 1929, when its leader Ludwig Czech became Minister of Public Affairs.
During the years of the great economic crisis, the party lost many of its Sudeten German supporters, and the Sudeten German Party (SdP) gained importance. As after the Munich Agreement the troops of Nazi Germany began occupying the Sudetes areas (on 1 October 1938), only some of the anti-Nazi opposition members could retreat into remaining Czechoslovakian territories. Immediately after the entry of the Nazi troops, the persecution of the Social democrats and other opponents of Nazism began. From October to December 1938, 20,000 members of the Social Democratic Party were arrested; 2,500 Sudeten Germans were sent to the Dachau concentration camp alone. Around 30,000 people managed to flee to the West. On 22 February 1939 the DSAP leadership decided to stop all activities in the territory of the Czechoslovakian Republic and to continue working abroad as "Treuegemeinschaft sudetendeutscher Sozialdemokraten". The group began publishing the monthly bulletin "Sudeten-Freiheit" from Oslo.
The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1938.

Rod Keller

Major General Rodney Frederick Leopold Keller CBE (2 October 1900 – 1954) was a notable Canadian Army officer who rose to divisional-level command in the Second World War. He commanded the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division which was assigned to take Juno Beach during the D-Day invasion.
Background.
Rod Keller entered the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, in the last years of the First World War. Upon graduating, he joined the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, one of the regiments of the Canadian Permanent Force. Like many other promising Canadian officers of that era, he attended Staff College, Camberley in England.
War service.
When Canada went to war, Rod Keller was sent overseas as a brigade major. He rose to the command of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry in 1941 and was promoted Officer Commanding the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade a few months later. Keller was made a major-general and, between September 8, 1942, and August 8, 1944, he served as General Officer Commanding the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.
Major-General Keller was popular with his troops, who appreciated his manners and outspoken language; however, a drinking problem and several breaches of security measures before D-Day cost him the support of both his superior officers and his own staff.
During the first month ashore in Normandy, it was noted he was "jumpy and high strung". His immediate superiors in I British Corps and 2nd British Army considered him unfit to command the division, but Lieutenant General Guy Simonds, who was scheduled to command II Canadian Corps upon its activation in Normandy, held off on making a decision about his relief, even refusing a resignation by Keller who himself admitted to the strain. During the Battle for Caen, Keller handled Operation Windsor poorly, sending a reinforced brigade in to handle a divisional operation and delegating the planning to one of his brigadiers. Keller was also reportedly shell-shy by August, and rumours began to spread among the division that "Keller was yeller."
Despite the continued complaints from above and below, Simonds, and General Harry Crerar, another of his admirers, refused to relieve him. Fate intervened when he was wounded by friendly fire on August 8. US bombers accidentally carpet bombed his divisional headquarters during Operation Totalize. Keller received no further active military command. He died ten years later, while visiting Normandy.
Death.
Rod keller died in 1954 during a visit to Normandy.
Legacy.
The Class entering in 1917 presented the Royal Military College of Canada with an oil painting of No. 1341, Major-General Rod Keller in 1965.

LMNA

Lamin A/C also known as LMNA is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "LMNA" gene. Lamin A/C belongs to the lamin family of proteins.
Function.
The nuclear lamina consist of a two-dimensional matrix of proteins located next to the inner nuclear membrane. The lamin family of proteins make up the matrix and are highly conserved in evolution. During mitosis, the lamina matrix is reversibly disassembled as the lamin proteins are phosphorylated. Lamin proteins are thought to be involved in nuclear stability, chromatin structure and gene expression. Vertebrate lamins consist of two types, A and B. Through alternate splicing, this gene encodes three type A lamin isoforms.
Early in mitosis, MPF phosphorylates specific serine residues in all three nuclear lamins, causing depolymerization of the lamin intermediate filaments. The phosphorylated lamin B dimers remain associated with the nuclear membrane via their isoprenyl anchor. Lamin A is targeted to the nuclear membrane by an isoprenyl group but it is cleaved shortly after arriving at the membrane. It stays associated with the membrane through protein-protein interactions of itself and other membrane associated proteins, such as LAP1. Depolymerization of the nuclear lamins leads to disintegration of the nuclear envelope. Transfection experiments demonstrate that phosphorylation of human lamin A is required for lamin depolymerization, and thus for disassembly of the nuclear envelope, which normally occurs early in mitosis.
Clinical significance.
Mutations in the "LMNA" gene are associated with several diseases, including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, familial partial lipodystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Restrictive dermopathy and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. A truncated version of lamin A, commonly known as progerin, causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.
Interactions.
LMNA has been shown to interact with:

Senate Committee on Forest Reservations and the Protection of Game

The Senate Committee on Forest Reservations and the Protection of Game is a defunct committee of the United States Senate. It was established on March 19, 1896 and was terminated April 18, 1921, when its functions were transferred to the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. The committee had overlapping jurisdiction with forestry policy handled by the agriculture committee, and outlived its usefulness during its later years.
The committee was preceded by two select committees, the Select Committee on Forest Reservations in California, which existed from July 28, 1892 to March 15, 1893, and the Select Committee on Forest Reservations which operated until March 19, 1896.

Vincent Pepi

Vincent Pepi (born 1926 in Boston) is an abstract expressionist painter associated with the New York School. His contribution to American art includes some of the foremost examples of action painting, produced consistently over the course of the second half of the 20th century. His art parallels the works of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Conrad Marca-Relli and others. He adapted the automatic techniques of the Surrealists and transformed it into his own kind of gesture painting.
Biography.
Vincent Pepi studied at Cooper Union and Pratt Institute. He traveled to Africa and Mexico. In 1949 he went to Rome, Italy. This was the same time that the Abstract Expressionist movement began in New York City. Three years later, in 1951, Pepi joined with many of the innovators of Action Painting in New York City. Upon his return to the United States, Pepi studied briefly with Hans Hofmann. Along with other first generation abstract expressionists, he showed his work at the Stable Gallery in 1953 and at the March Gallery on Tenth Street, from 1955 until its closing in 1960. 
Pepi attended the "Artists' Club"
from time to time, but preferred his own studio and a more solitary existence. A graphics business which he created permitted him to live and paint while freeing him from the necessity of regularly exhibiting his work. His choice to live in Italy from 1949–51, during a crucial time in the formation of the New York School, as well as his preference for painting in a consistently smaller format, may have obscured the recognition and fame that otherwise might have been his. 
The artist's acknowledged sources range from old masters to the Futurists (especially Boccioni and Balla): from Klee and Kandinsky to Matta, Gorky and Pepi's contemporaries. His academically trained teacher in Italy, Beppe Guzzi, helped him to incorporate rigorous discipline into his painting, as well as introducing him to a number of important Italian painters and sculptors. Like Pollock and other Abstract Expressionists he admires, Pepi has always loved music, particularly jazz, going as far as learning to play the tenor saxophone. Color and music appear parallel to him: the artist/ musician improvises with both. And so it follows that Pepi's own automatic painting and line poems" are reminiscent of works by Paul Klee, with the latter's powerful equations of color, line and music. 
Pepi defines himself as an academic artist, but one who felt he had to take that "main highway between Cézanne and Kandinsky". His paintings do indeed, reveal a Cézanne-like underpinning of abstract structure, while adopting the free improvisatory phase of Kandinsky at the same time. It is the revelation of the unconscious that Pepi seeks in his work. He wants his work to be spontaneous and uncontrived. 
This biography was realized from the writings of Greta Berman, Author, Art Historian, Juilliard School of Music, New York.

Red Food

Red Food Stores, Inc. (or simply Red Food) was a supermarket chain company headquartered in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It operated stores mostly in northwest Georgia, northeast Alabama, and southeast Tennessee. Around 55 stores were operated in the same three states. According to The Chattanoogan, Red Food was a longtime icon in Chattanooga history.
History.
Red Food started in 1908 by Frank McDonald. During World War II, for their first time, Red Food sold turkeys for forty-five cents per pound to customers for Thanksgiving. They also told customers to "invite a soldier and serve turkey this Thanksgiving." In 1979, Promodès, a food distribution firm based in Caen, France, made a bid to buy Red Food Stores, Inc. for $23 million. By 1980, the acquisition was completed, for a total of $36 million. The Red Food purchase gave Promodès 23 supermarkets centered primarily in southern Tennessee, plus additional stores in Georgia and Alabama as well. In order to finance Promodès' expansion, which would invest more than Ffr 2 billion between 1979 and 1984, the company went public in 1979.
On April, 1989, Red Food Store's purchase of seven supermarkets in its hometown owned by Kroger Co. was halted at virtually the 11th hour by the Federal Trade Commission, which decided the merger would substantially hamper competition in the market. The FTC action came unexpectedly. A month later, the FTC issued a complaint, challenging Red Food Stores' $6.5 million acquisition of all seven Kroger Co. grocery stores in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The commission lodged the complaint after a Federal appeals court rejected its request for an injunction blocking the transaction.
In 1994, Red Food Stores, Inc. was bought by Ahold for $129 million, while Red Food stores were changed into Ahold's BI-LO stores in 1995. Advertisements showed a paper bag with the BI-LO logo (currently used today) standing in front of a paper bag with the last Red Food logo on it. BI-LO's slogan during that time was "BI-LO. The name fits."
Logos.
The first logo used by Red Food Stores, Inc. was similar to the second one (as seen in this article), but with a rooster in the middle of it. The last logo used was plain red with little or no curves around the inside and outside of the letters. It was introduced a year before Ahold bought the company.
