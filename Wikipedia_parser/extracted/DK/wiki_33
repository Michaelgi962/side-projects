John Joseph Therry

Father John Therry (1790 - 25 May 1864) was an Irish, early Roman Catholic priest in Sydney, Australia.
Early life.
Father John Therry was born in Cork and was privately educated at St Patrick's College at Carlow, and in 1815 was ordained as a priest. He did parish work in Dublin and later on was secretary to the bishop of Cork. He had heard that Catholic convicts in Australia were without a priest to minister to them, and let it be known that he would be willing to go there as a missionary. On 5 December 1819 he sailed on the "Janus" with another priest, the Rev. P. Conolly, as a companion. They arrived at Sydney on 3 May 1820. Unlike the Rev. Father O'Flynn, who had previously arrived without government sanction and had been deported, the two priests were accredited chaplains with a salary from the government of £1000 a year each. The two men were of different temperaments and found it difficult to agree, and in 1821 Conolly went to Tasmania and remained there until his death in 1839.
St Mary's Cathedral.
Fr. John Therry set about his work with great enthusiasim. His chief anxiety was the need of a church, and in view of the increase in the population of Sydney in future years, it was decided that it should be on a large scale. Almost by chance the site on which St Mary's Cathedral now stands was granted by the government, subscriptions were given by generous people, including many non-Catholics, and by 1823 it had been agreed that if a fresh subscription were opened the government would give a sum "equal to the sum total of all such additional donations". Governor Macquarie had laid the foundation-stone on 29 October 1821. Governor Brisbane, who succeeded Macquarie, was tolerant and helpful, but when Governor Darling arrived in December 1825 a period of anxiety for Therry and his church set in.
In June 1826, Therry sent a letter to Colonial Secretary McLeay which Darling described as "insulting" when it was sent on to the colonial office. It was certainly a tactless letter, and one that could hardly be expected to help Therry in his work (See H.R. of A., vol. XII, p. 543). He had been in conflict with Darling before, and in February 1826 Bathurst had sent instructions that his salary should be stopped. Darling had not yet received this dispatch, and he now asked that Therry should be removed. For the next 12 years, until 1857, Therry was without the official status of a government chaplain. The Rev. Father Power was appointed chaplain, a man in poor health, who was compelled at times to accept assistance from Therry, though the two men were unable to find a way of living amicably together. Power, however, died in March 1830, Therry was again alone, and the government was compelled to countenance his ministrations. He was much helped by a friendship he formed with a namesake, Roger Therry, who arrived in Sydney towards the end of 1829, held many important positions, and became a leading Roman Catholic layman.
In September 1831 Therry was supplanted by the Rev. C. V. Downing who succeeded Power. Similar difficulties arose, but Darling had left at the end of 1830 and the arrival of the wise and just Governor Bourke gave new hope to the Roman Catholic community. In August 1832 the Rev. John McEncroe came to Sydney and established a friendship with Therry. In February 1833 Father William Bernard Ullathorne arrived and informed Therry that he had come as vicar-general, and Therry at once submitted to his authority. Ullathorne, who was young with a fine grasp of business, was at times critical of Therry's lack of this quality, but realized how truly religious he was and how hard he had worked for his people. In May 1834 John Bede Polding, the first Roman Catholic bishop in Australia, was appointed and arrived in September 1835. In April 1837 Therry was officially reinstated as a chaplain at a salary of £150 a year, and in April 1838 he arrived at Launceston on a mission to the Church in Tasmania. In March 1839 he permanently took up his position in Tasmania as vicar-general and worked there with some success.
Suspension.
The arrival of Robert William Willson, first bishop of Hobart, in May 1844 led to much unhappiness for Therry. Bishop Willson had stipulated before accepting the see that Therry should be recalled from Hobart before his arrival. This was not done and the bishop promptly removed Therry from office. Difficulties also arose concerning the responsibility for church debts, and eventually Therry was suspended from all clerical duties. He remained for two years in Tasmania and in August 1846 was transferred to Melbourne, where he made a reputation for his charity and missionary work. After a fruitless visit to Tasmania, made in the hope of composing his differences with the bishop, he went to Sydney in 1847 and was made priest in charge at Windsor.
Return to Tasmania.
In September 1848 he was again in Hobart, and remained for five years, much occupied with matters relating to the disputes over the finances.
Later life.
Early in 1854 he returned to Sydney and in May 1856 again took up parish work at St Augustine's, Balmain. He seems to have had by now considerable private means, as in August 1856 he gave £2000to the fund for the completion of the cathedral. Many friendless men had left their small belongings to him, and land granted to him in the early days had become valuable. In 1858 he was raised to the dignity of archpriest, a rank today known as vicar capitular. On 25 May 1864 he died after a few hours illness, working to the last day of his life.
In present day John Therry has two schools named after him, one in Balmain (FJT School Balmain), Sydney and one in Campbelltown, Sydney.

Camp Atterbury

Camp Atterbury, near Edinburgh, Indiana, USA, is a training base of the Indiana National Guard. It was planned just months before the U.S. entry into World War II. Originally surveyed and researched by the Hurd Company, the present site was recommended to Congress in 1941. Construction commenced shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. More than 1,500 wood frame buildings were constructed, sized to hold more than one army infantry division. It also contained the 47-building, (concrete block, 2-story) Wakeman General and Convalescent Hospital, the largest hospital of its kind in the US in the 1940s. It was known for its progressive plastic eye replacements. During World War II, the U.S. 39th Evacuation Hospital, the 101st Infantry Battalion (Separate) and four U.S. Army infantry divisions, the 30th, 83rd, 92nd, and 106th, trained here. The 106th left Camp Atterbury on 9 October 1944 and two months later was on the front lines, crossing into Belgium on 10 December 1944. Spread over a front, they bore the brunt of the Battle of the Bulge with more than 7,000 total combat-related casualties (combined missing, killed, or wounded in action.)
The camp was named for William Wallace Atterbury (1866–1935), an executive of the Pennsylvania Railroad who ultimately became the railroad's president. Upon American entry into World War I, Atterbury, then a PRR vice-president, was commissioned into the U.S. Army as a Brigadier General to oversee the construction and operation of U.S. military railways in France, between August 1917 and May 1919. 
During World War II, Camp Atterbury was also used as a prisoner of war camp, housing German and Italian soldiers. A small Roman Catholic chapel was built by the Italian prisoners, which was restored and dedicated in 1989.
Shortly after the end of World War II, the base was put into mothballs. At the onset of the Korean War, it was once again activated with the arrival of the 28th Infantry Division in 1950. The 28th left for Germany, to be replaced by the 31st Infantry Division. When the 31st left in 1954 for Camp Carson, Colorado, the base once again was mothballed. It was later given to the Indiana Army National Guard.
Serving as a National Guard training facility, it again gained importance following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Camp Atterbury Joint Maneuver Training Center (CAJMTC) was activated in February 2003. Thousands of regular and reserve forces have received training here just prior to deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq. It is one of two Guard bases with this mission, Camp Shelby in Mississippi being the other. Camp Atterbury has also trained thousands of civilians; from the Inter-Agency and DOD (Department of Defense) as they prepare to mobilize in support of stability operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait.
Originally 43,000 acres (170 km²), it is now reduced to approximately 30,000 acres (120 km²), with the remaining being leased to the Atterbury Job Corps, the US Department of Labor, the Hoosier Horse Park and the Johnson County Parks Department. Plans are under way to reclaim some of the area.
In 2005, it gained the former Muscatatuck State Hospital grounds, composed of some 3,000 acres (12 km²) with several permanent buildings, including 5-story buildings with underground tunnels ( view), to be used as an urban training facility. Troops and civilian emergency management organizations are transported from Camp Atterbury Joint Maneuver Training Center to Muscatatuck Urban Training Center (MUTC) via air or ground means for training in urban warfare and operations other than war.
The Civil Air Patrol's National Emergency Services Academy (NESA) is held at Camp Atterbury each summer .
On 3 June 2008, a tornado hit Camp Atterbury, damaging 50 buildings, power lines, and vehicles. No injuries were reported. Only four days later, soldiers and Marines at Camp Atterbury were widely utilized in response to the June 2008 Midwest floods.
In beginning of January 2013, the U.S. Government planned a budget cut called sequester, the cut included Camp Atterbury. The shutdown of the base started in February to September, laying off over 750 civilian workers and all soldiers station at Atterbury were moved out to other bases. Indiana's Governor Mike Pence planned to keep the base for National Guard, but he came in office it was too late save the base.
Camp Atterbury was chosen as the site for a UAV-focused NASA Centennial Challenge with the goal of developing some of the key technologies that will make it possible to integrate unmanned aerial vehicles into the National Airspace System. The competition is to be held on September 10 - 17, 2014.

Roger Therry

Roger Therry (22 April 1800 – 17 May 1874) was an Irish-Australian jurist.
Therry was born in Ireland. He was called to the bar in Ireland in 1824 and in England in 1827. His A Letter to the Right Hon. George Canning on the "Present State of the Catholic Question", published in 1826, second edition 1827, probably led to his acquaintance with that statesman, who employed him to edit his speeches and prepare them for publication. They were published after Canning's death in 1828 with a life of Canning written by Therry. By the influence of Canning's widow and friends Therry was appointed commissioner of the court of requests for New South Wales, and in July 1829 he set sail for Sydney.
He was a Roman Catholic, and on his arrival found that most of his co-religionists were poor, and few held positions of importance in Sydney. He also found that while the Anglican Church was comparatively well subsidized by the state, very little was allowed to the Roman Catholic clergy. He endeavoured with considerable success to improve their position, and for the next 30 years held an important place among the Catholic laity. He was made a magistrate in 1830 and in 1839 refused an acting judgeship. Governor Gipps, in a dispatch notifying this to Lord Glenelg, referred to Therry as one of the "two most distinguished barristers of New South Wales".
He was appointed acting attorney-general in 1841, and at the first election for the New South Wales Legislative Council held in 1843 he was elected as the representative of Camden. In December 1844 Therry was appointed resident judge at Port Phillip and held the position until February 1846, when he became a judge of the supreme court of New South Wales. He visited England in 1847 and retired on a pension in 1859. His "Reminiscences of Thirty Years Residence in New South Wales and Victoria" was published at the beginning of 1863 and immediately withdrawn. The new edition which appeared in the same year was not, however, an "expurgated version" as has been stated. Some errors were corrected, but the changes are not considerable. The most important were that the author did fuller justice to the work of three governors, Gipps, Fitzroy, and La Trobe, and a map was added.
Therry died on 17 May 1874. He was survived by Lady Therry and probably a family, as when he applied for leave of absence in July 1846, he mentioned that he had two daughters being educated in England. He was knighted in 1869.

The Boys with the Golden Stars

The Boys with the Golden Stars (Romanian: "Doi feți cu stea în frunte") is a Romanian fairy tale collected in "Rumanische Märchen". Andrew Lang included it in "The Violet Fairy Book".
Synopsis.
A herdsman had three daughters. The youngest was the most beautiful. One day, the emperor was passing with attendants. The oldest daughter said that if he married her, she would bake him a loaf of bread that would make him young and brave forever; the second one said, if one married her, she would make him a shirt that would protect him in any fight, even with a dragon, and against heat and water; the youngest one said that she would bear him twin sons with stars on their foreheads. The emperor married the youngest, and two of his friends married the other two.
The emperor's stepmother had wanted him to marry her daughter and so hated his new wife. She got her brother to declare war on him, to get him away from her, and when the empress gave birth in his absence, killed and buried to the twins in the corner of the garden and put puppies in their place. The emperor punished his wife to show what happened to those who deceived the emperor.
Two aspens grew from the grave, putting on years' growth in hours. The stepmother wanted to chop them down, but the emperor forbade it. Finally, she convinced him, on the condition that she had beds made from the wood, one for him and one for her. In the night, the beds began to talk to each other. The stepmother had two new beds made, and burned the originals. While they were burning, the two brightest sparks flew off and fell into the river. They became two golden fish. When fishermen caught them, they wanted to take them alive to the emperor. The fishes told them to let them swim in dew instead, and then dry them out in the sun. When they did this, the fishes turned back into babies, maturing in days.
Wearing lambskin caps that covered their hair and stars, they went to their father's castle and forced their way in. Despite their refusal to take off their caps, the emperor listened to their story, only then removing their caps. The emperor executed his stepmother and took back his wife.
Motifs.
The motif of a woman's babies, born with wonderful attributes after she claimed she could bear such children, but stolen from her, is a common fairy tale motif; see "The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird", "The Tale of Tsar Saltan", "The Three Little Birds", "The Wicked Sisters", "Ancilotto, King of Provino", and "Princess Belle-Etoile". Some of these variants feature an evil stepmother. But the transformation chase where the stepmother is unable to prevent the children's reappearance is unusual, although it appears in "A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers" and in "The Count's Evil Mother", a Croatian tale from the Karlovac area. "The Pretty Little Calf" also has the child reappear, transformed after being murdered, but only has the transformation to an animal form and back to human.
A similar series of transformations is found in "Beauty and Pock Face" and "The Story of Tam and Cam".

Leo Sheffield

Leo Sheffield (15 November 1873 – 3 September 1951) was an English singer and actor best known for his performances in baritone roles of the Savoy Operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. 
He made his first stage appearances under the direction of W. S. Gilbert in 1906, remaining with the D'Oyly Carte company for three years. After touring in musical theatre for the next five years with other managements, he rejoined D'Oyly Carte from 1915 to 1928 in the principal baritone roles, appearing in London seasons and on tour in Britain and, in one of his last seasons, Canada. He recorded many of these roles.
After leaving D'Oyly Carte, Sheffield worked in a wide variety of theatre, including musical comedy, straight plays, pantomime, and in radio and films. He continued to tour during the Second World War while in his seventies.
Life and career.
Early years.
Sheffield was born Leo Wilson in Malton, Yorkshire. Two of his brothers, Thorpe and Wilson Sheffield, appeared with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in the 1890s.
Sheffield joined D'Oyly Carte in 1906, appearing at the Savoy Theatre under the direction of W. S. Gilbert in the first repertory season of Savoy Operas. During this season, he played the roles of Second Yeoman and then Lieutenant of the Tower in "The Yeomen of the Guard", and Annibale and later Luiz in "The Gondoliers". From 1907 to 1909, he toured with D'Oyly Carte, playing the Counsel for the Plaintiff in "Trial by Jury", Boatswain in "H.M.S. Pinafore", Samuel in "The Pirates of Penzance", Archibald Grosvenor in "Patience", Strephon in "Iolanthe", Arac in "Princess Ida", Pish-Tush in "The Mikado", Sergeant Meryll in "Yeomen", and Luiz. In the second repertory season at the Savoy, from April 1908 to March 1909, he played Pish-Tush, the Boatswain, Private Willis in "Iolanthe", Samuel, Luiz and the Lieutenant, and Owen Rhys in "A Welsh Sunset" a short sentimental piece which was given as a curtain raiser.
Sheffield then left the D'Oyly Carte company but returned to the Savoy Theatre later in 1909, under the management of C. H. Workman, creating the role of Sir Phyllon in Gilbert and Edward German's "Fallen Fairies". Gilbert praised him as a "fine baritone" and an "excellent actor". He then toured for five years, beginning with another of Workman's Savoy operas, "The Mountaineers", and in musicals, including "The Chocolate Soldier", "The Girl in the Taxi," and "The Girl Who Didn't". He appeared in London only once during this period, as Feste in "Twelfth Night", in 1913.
D'Oyly Carte principal baritone.
In 1915, Sheffield rejoined D'Oyly Carte, remaining with the company until 1928 as its principal baritone. During this period, he appeared as the Learned Judge in "Trial", Doctor Daly in "The Sorcerer", Dick Deadeye and then Captain Corcoran in "Pinafore", the Sergeant of Police in "Pirates", Grosvenor in "Patience", Willis and sometimes Strephon in "Iolanthe", King Hildebrand and sometimes Florian in "Princess Ida", Pooh-Bah in "The Mikado", Sir Despard Murgatroyd in "Ruddigore", Wilfred Shadbolt in "Yeomen", and Don Alhambra in "The Gondoliers". Comparing Sheffield's Pooh-Bah with that of his predecessor, Fred Billington, the critic of "The Manchester Guardian", Samuel Langford, wrote, "Mr. Leo Sheffield finds his resource in a more yielding variety, a greater urbanity of appeal to the audience, and in affectionate emulation of his predecessor's genial condescensions." Sheffield's only overseas tour with the company was in 1927, playing a five-month tour of Canada. He left D'Oyly Carte in June 1928, appearing in 1929 in a revival of the musical comedy "The Lady of the Rose". He returned to D'Oyly Carte for the London season at the Savoy from October 1929 to March 1930, after which he left the company permanently.
Sheffield was married to a D'Oyly Carte Opera Company chorister, Dorothy Gates, who joined the company in 1923. Their daughter, Patience, married the D'Oyly Carte principal comedian of the 1950s, Peter Pratt.
Later years.
In 1930, Sheffield appeared in "a new all-British musical comedy", "Little Tommy Tucker", with music by Vivian Ellis, at Daly's Theatre. In 1931, after appearing with George Grossmith, Jr. in "My Sister and I", at the Shaftesbury Theatre, he was in a revival of Sheridan's "The Duenna" at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. "The Times" commented, "Mr. Leo Sheffield's Don Jerome will be better when he is surer of his lines," but "The Observer" thought him a "ripe purveyor … of fatherly fun." Also in 1931 he played in a revival of "The Geisha" at Daly's, which was followed by a provincial tour. "The Geisha" was succeeded at Daly's in 1932 by a revival of "San Toy", in which he played Yen How. In 1933, he played in a non-musical comedy, "Mother of Pearl", by A. P. Herbert, in a cast including Rex Harrison, and Richard Murdoch. "The Geisha" was revived again in 1934. "The Times" wrote, "Mr. Leo Sheffield plays the Marquis Imari with an easy mastery." 
Sheffield also appeared in a number of films, beginning in 1928 with "The Valley of Ghosts", followed by "Lord Richard in the Pantry" (1930); "Compromising Daphne" (1930); "Rodney Steps In" (1931); "High Society" (1932); "Falling for You" (1933); and others. On stage in 1935, he appeared in a musical farce, "Twenty to One". For the Christmas season of 1936, he appeared in the pantomime "Aladdin" with Stanley Holloway. In 1938, he toured as Captain Hook in "Peter Pan", with Anna Neagle in the title role, and reprised the part the following year with Jean Forbes-Robertson as Peter.
His last role in London was Popoff in "The Chocolate Soldier" in 1940, which also toured the provinces. He later toured in "The Beggar's Opera" in 1941 and served with Entertainments National Service Association in 1942. Now 70 years old, he toured in "The Chocolate Soldier" and "Blossom Time" in 1943. In 1944, Sheffield played Sir Lester Dedlock in a serialisation of "Bleak House" for BBC radio, and in 1945 he toured in "Naughty Marietta", with Derek Oldham, "The Gypsy Baron", and "The Melody of Love". In 1947, he appeared as himself and as Pooh-Bah in the original radio biography, "Gilbert and Sullivan", written by Leslie Baily.
He died suddenly in Kingsbury, London, in 1951, aged 77.
Recordings.
With the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, Sheffield recorded Sir Despard (1924), King Hildebrand (1925), Pooh-Bah (1927), Don Alhambra (1927), the Learned Judge (1928), the Sergeant of Police (1929) and Wilfred Shadbolt (1929). He participated in a 1926 BBC radio broadcast of "The Mikado", and as Pooh-Bah in a four minute promotional silent film made to publicise the new production of "The Mikado". A 1924 photograph of Sheffield and D'Oyly Carte colleagues with the huge recording horn used in the acoustic recording process can be seen here. Later, Sheffield made recordings of comic songs with Cicely Courtneidge.

Big Three (automobile manufacturers)

The Big Three, when used in relation to the automotive industry, refers to the three major automotive companies of a geographic area. For example, when used in relation to Germany, it refers to the three major carmakers Audi (owned by Volkswagen), Mercedes-Benz (owned by Daimler AG) and BMW.
United States and Canada.
General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler are often referred to as the "Big Three," being the largest automakers in the United States and Canada. They were for a while the largest in the world and two of them are still a mainstay in the top five. Ford has held the position of second-ranked automaker for the past 56 years, being relegated to third in North American sales, after being overtaken by Toyota in 2007. That year, Toyota produced more vehicles than GM, though GM still outsold Toyota that year, giving GM 77 consecutive calendar years of top sales. For the first quarter of 2008, however, Toyota overtook GM in sales as well.
In the North American market, the Detroit automakers retained the top three spots, though their market share is dwindling. Honda passed Chrysler for the fourth spot in 2008 US sales. Since then, because of Toyota's woes with their recent unintended acceleration recall, Toyota has fallen back to fourth place in sales, with Honda trailing in fifth place, allowing the Detroit Three reclaim their Big Three title.
The Big Three are also distinguished not just by their size and geography, but also by their business model. The majority of their operations are unionized (United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers), resulting in higher labor costs than other multinational automakers, including those with plants in North America. The 2005 Harbour Report estimated that Toyota's lead in labour productivity amounted to a cost advantage of $350 US to $500 US per vehicle over American manufacturers. The UAW agreed to a two-tier wage in recent 2007 negotiations, something which the CAW has so far refused. Delphi, which was spun off from GM in 1999, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after the UAW refused to cut their wages and GM is expected to be liable for a $7 billion shortfall.
In order to improve profits, the Detroit automakers made deals with unions to reduce wages while making pension and health care commitments. GM, for instance, at one time picked up the entire cost of funding health insurance premiums of its employees, their survivors and GM retirees, as the US did not have a universal health care system. With most of these plans chronically underfunded in the late 1990s, the companies have tried to provide retirement packages to older workers, and made agreements with the UAW to transfer pension obligations to an independent trust. In 2009, the CBC reported that the non-unionized Japanese automakers, with their younger American workforces and fewer retirees will continue to enjoy a cost advantage over the Big Three.
Despite the history of their marques, many long running cars have been discontinued or relegated to fleet sales
, as the Big Three shifted away resources from midsize and compact cars to lead the "SUV Craze". Since the late 1990s, over half of their profits have come from light trucks and SUVs, while they often could not break even on compact cars unless the buyer chose options.
Ron Harbour, in releasing the Oliver Wyman’s 2008 Harbour Report, stated that many small “econoboxes” of the past acted as loss leaders, but were designed to bring customers to the brand in the hopes they would stay loyal and move up to more profitable models. The report estimated that an automaker needed to sell ten small cars to make the same profit as one big vehicle, and that they had to produce small and mid-size cars profitably to succeed, something that the Detroit three had trouble doing.
SUV sales peaked in 1999 but have not returned to that level ever since, due to high gas prices. The Big Three have suffered from perceived inferior initial quality and reliability compared to their Japanese counterparts, which has been difficult to overcome. They have also been slow to bring new vehicles to the market, while the Japanese are also considered the leader at producing smaller, fuel-efficient cars.
Falling sales and market share have resulted in the Big Three's plants operating below capacity (GM's plants were at 85% in November 2005, well below the plants of its Asian competitors), leading to production cuts, plant closures and layoffs. They have been relying heavily on considerable incentives and subsidized leases to sell vehicles. which was crucial to keeping the plants running, which in turn drove a significant portion of the Michigan economy. These promotional strategies, including rebates, employee pricing and 0% financing, have boosted sales but have also cut into profits. More importantly such promotions drain the automaker's cash reserves in the near term while in the long run the company suffers the stigma of selling vehicles because of low price instead of technical merit. Automakers have since been trying to scale back on incentives and raise prices, while cutting production. The subprime mortgage crisis and high oil prices in 2008 resulting in the plummeting popularity of best-selling trucks and SUVs, perhaps forcing automakers to continue offering heavy incentives to help clear excess inventory.
The Big Three sued California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to prevent a tailpipe emissions requirement. In response, Governor Schwarzenegger told the Big Three to "get off their butt".
In 2008, with high oil prices and a declining US economy due to the subprime mortgage crisis, the Big Three are rethinking their strategy, idling or converting light truck plants to make small cars. Due to the declining residual value of their vehicles, Chrysler has stopped offering leases on its vehicles.
In 2009, General Motors and Chrysler filed for and emerged from Chapter 11 restructuring in the United States. General Motors of Canada did not file for bankruptcy. The United States and Canadian government control are reported as temporary. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler Group LLC emerged from a Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy and was sold to the Italian automaker Fiat. On June 3, 2011, Fiat bought out the remaining U.S. Treasury’s stake in Chrysler for $500 million increasing its ownership of the automaker to 53%.
In April 2012, GM and Ford continued to lose market share as sales were down 8.2% and 5.3% year over year respectively. There have been no independent car makers other than Ford, GM, and Chrysler since the last independent automaker, American Motors, was bought by Chrysler in 1987.
Japan.
Japanese automakers Toyota, Nissan, and Honda, among many others, have long been considered the leaders at producing smaller, fuel-efficient cars. Their vehicles were brought to the forefront, due to the 1973 oil crisis which had a major impact on the auto industry. For instance, the Honda Civic was considered superior to American competitors such as the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto. The Civic is the best-selling car in Canada for 12 years in a row. 
As well, the Nissan 240Z was introduced at a relatively low price compared to other foreign sports cars of the time (Jaguar, BMW, Porsche, etc.), while providing performance, reliability, and good looks. This broadened the image of Japanese car-makers beyond their econobox successes, as well as being credited as a catalyst for the import performance parts industry.
Before Honda unveiled Acura in 1986, Japanese automobiles exports were primarily economical in design and largely targeted at low-cost consumers. The Japanese big three created their luxury marques to challenge the established brands. Following Honda's lead, Toyota launched the Lexus name with the LS 400 which debuted at $38,000 in the U.S. (in some markets being priced against mid-sized six cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models), and was rated by "Car and Driver" magazine as better than both the $63,000 Mercedes-Benz W126 and the $55,000 BMW E32 in terms of ride, handling and performance. It was generally regarded as a major shock to the European marques; BMW and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29% and 19%, respectively, with the then-BMW chairman Eberhard von Kuenheim accusing Lexus of dumping in that market. Nissan's Infiniti became a player on the luxury market mostly thanks to its popular Q45. The vehicle included a class-leading (at the time) 278 hp (207 kW) V8 engine, four wheel steering, the first active suspension system offered on a motor vehicle, and numerous interior luxury appointments. These made it competitive against the German imports like Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which by the time of Infiniti's release had overtaken Cadillac and Lincoln in dominating the luxury segment of the American market. In 1990, four years after the debut of the Legend and Integra, Acura introduced the NSX, a midship V6 powered, rear-wheel-drive sports car. The NSX, an acronym for "New Sports eXperimental", was billed as the first Japanese car capable of competing with Ferrari and Porsche. This vehicle served as a halo car for the Acura brand. The NSX was the world's first all-aluminum production car, and was also marketed and viewed by some as the "Everyday Supercar" thanks in part to its ease of use, quality and reliability, traits that were unheard of in the supercar segment at the time.
The success of the Japanese automakers contributed to their American counterparts falling into a recession in the late 1970s. Unions and lobbyists in both North America and Europe put pressure on their government to restrict imports. In 1981, Japan agreed to Voluntary Export Restraints in order to preempt protectionism measures that the US may have taken, where it be tariffs or import quotas. Consequently, Japanese companies responded by investing heavily in US production facilities, as they were not subject to the VER. Unlike the plants of domestic automakers, Japanese plants are non-unioned (save for NUMMI), so they have lower wage expenses and do not face the risk of strikes. The VER was lifted in 1994 upon agreement of all members of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Establishing US production facilities was also a significant step in improving public relations, along with philanthropy, lobbying efforts, and sharing technology. Europe has still largely maintained its protectionism policies against Japanese cars, though their varies considerably.
Toyota has always been by far Japan's largest automaker, and it recently overtook perennial world leader GM in both production and sales by early 2008. As the most aggressive of Japan's companies when it came to expanding into light trucks and luxury vehicles, this proved largely successful. Their high-end brand Lexus became the top-selling luxury marque worldwide in 2000, despite being only started up in 1989. Consequently, Toyota's stock price has traded at a much higher premium than other automakers. Nissan regained its position on second place, financial difficulties in the late 1990s caused it to lose its place to Honda before. Nissan is Japan’s second largest automaker and ranks sixth in the world, behind Toyota, GM, Volkswagen, Ford, and Hyundai. Suzuki, Mazda, and Mitsubishi are in a distant fourth, fifth, and sixth place compared to the Japanese Big Three.
Toyota, Honda, and Nissan are all in the BusinessWeek magazine's "The 100 Top Global Brands" by dollar value, as ranked by leading brand consultancy Interbrand. The Toyota marque was valued at US$22.67 billion, ranking it ninth among all global brand names - automotive or non-automotive, edging out that of Mercedes-Benz. 2010 end of year production figures from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers shows that Toyota holds the number 1 spot, Nissan number 6, and Honda number 7.
Germany.
The German trio Audi, Mercedes-Benz and BMW are often referred to as "Germany's Big Three", although the actual major automobile manufacturers are the Volkswagen Group (producer of Audi), Daimler AG (producer of Mercedes-Benz), and BMW.
Volkswagen Group has long been the largest automaker in Europe. As of 2007 it edged out Ford to rank third in the world after General Motors and Toyota. It is also the parent group of Audi, Porsche, SEAT, Škoda, Bugatti, Lamborghini and Bentley.
Daimler AG holds major stakes in other automakers including Mitsubishi Fuso.
BMW also produces MINI branded vehicles, and has been the parent company of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars since 1998.
BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi make up about 86% of the luxury midsize market.

Johann Siegfried Hufnagel

Johann Siegfried Hufnagel (17 October 1724, Falkenwalde, Prenzlau district, Brandenburg – 23 February 1795, Langenfeld, Sternberg district) was a German parson and entomologist (lepidopterist).
Life.
Until the late 20th century nothing was known about Hufnagel's life. Even his first names remained unknown. In 1987 Gerstberger and Stiesy succeeded in identifying him with the help of Fischer's work (1941) and uncovered some basic biographical information.
Hufnagel came from a family of Protestant clergymen, his father and grandfather before him having been parsons. Johann Siegfried probably attended one of the universities in northern or eastern Germany (but not in Berlin as Berlin had no university at the time). From 1759 to 1767 the Berlin address book mentions one "Hufnagel" or "Huffnagel" who was praeceptor (teacher) at the Protestant-Lutheran church near the "Grosses Friedrichs-Hospital und Waisenhaus" (hospital and orphanage) and lived in the orphanage. As this is consistent both with the career progression of young theologians at the time who often worked as teachers before their first appointment and with Fischer's records it seems safe to assume that this was indeed the lepidopterist Johann Siegfried Hufnagel. He had his first position in 1767 in Petersberg (Oststernberg district; today Jemiołów, Swiebodzin district, Poland). From 1775 until his death in 1795 he was the parson of Langenfeld (Oststernberg district, today Długoszyn, Sulecin district, Poland). 
Achievement and Impact.
Between 1765 and 1767 Hufnagel published thirteen papers on Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), ten of them during 1766, and all in the journal "Berlinisches Magazin, oder gesammlete Schriften und Nachrichten für die Liebhaber der Arzneywissenschaft, Naturgeschichte und der angenehmen Wissenschaften überhaupt", one of the learned journals covering a wide range of aspects in the fields of natural history and medicine which had been founded during the 18th century. One of his papers was devoted to agricultural pests, four contained descriptions of single species treated in some detail and accompanied by illustrations. The other eight papers formed a treatment in tabular form of the larger Lepidoptera (mainly the so-called Macrolepidoptera) of the Berlin area which were represented in Hufnagel's collection. Later authors often referred to this series of papers as "Die Tabellen" (the tables). Due to this form of presentation the descriptions of new species are very brief. A further impediment is Hufnagel's lack of a terminology for the wing pattern elements of Lepidoptera which makes his descriptions difficult to interpret even for native speakers of German. For example, the diagnosis of "Phalaena grisea" runs as follows: "Die Graumotte. Ganz gelblichgrau mit vielen zerstreuten grauen und braunen Flecken." [The Grey Moth. Entirely yellowish grey with many scattered grey and brown spots. 
By the mid-1770s Hufnagel had become acquainted with Freiherr S. A. von Rottemburg who lived in Klemzig near Züllichau (then Neumark, today Poland). Hufnagel gave him his collection together with detailed explanations about his publications. In 1775 and 1776 Rottemburg published a series of papers on the Hufnagel collection redescribing many species in detail. It is mainly due to this work that most of Hufnagel's taxa can be identified. Unfortunately by this time a number of species seems to have been lost from the collection, and in some cases there seems to have been a mix-up of specimens, so that not all problems of identification are solved. Although many of Hufnagel's names had priority most authors of the early 19th century preferred to ignore them or to consider them as doubtful. It was not until 1844 when Philipp Christoph Zeller published an analysis of Hufnagel's work identifying many species that the names became known to a wider circle of lepidopterists and eventually began to gain acceptance. 
The fate of the Hufnagel collection is unknown. Whether it was given back to Hufnagel or remained in Rottemburg's or his family's possession it has never been heard of again and most likely perished soon after Rottemburg's death. 
At the current state of nomenclature 87 of Hufnagel's taxa are in use as valid names for Lepidoptera species.

United Socialist Movement

The United Socialist Movement was an anarcho-communist political organisation based in Glasgow. It published a journal, "The Word".
The group's roots lay in the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation. Guy Aldred, a leading figure in the group, came to believe that Parliamentarianism was essentially dead, and so there was no longer a need for an anti-Parliamentary propaganda group. In February 1933, he left, with supporters including Ethel MacDonald. In 1934, they linked up with some members of the Independent Labour Party to form the United Socialist Movement.
Aldred used the support of the group to stand for Parliament on an abstentionist platform, and also to stand for Glasgow City Council. The group opposed World War II, while trying to build a broad-based opposition.
The group was wound up in 1965, a couple of years after Aldred's death.

Rikki Wemega-Kwawu is a contemporary Ghanaian artist, born on February 3, 1959 in the city of Sekondi, Ghana. A devoted painter since 1981, he is largely self-taught, though he is an alumnus of the prestigious Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Skowhegan, Maine. He has participated in many group exhibitions and his work can be found across the world in private and public collections, including the Dutch Artotheek.
Wemega-Kwawu is, in his own words, "a very eclectic painter, swinging easily between pictorial and abstract themes, without any qualms." A statement written by the artist can be found at the website of African Encounters, his representatives on the west coast.
Wemega-Kwawu's work is characterized by a synthesis of the past and the present. He incorporates a plethora of ancient African symbols into his large-scale paintings. He states: "Drawing upon a vein of ancient African religious iconography, I aim in my work at a symbolic expression of a spiritual process and spiritual knowledge to recapture the lost power of traditional African art."
He is also known as a "conceptual artist" and promotes the use of diverse media in visual art. His projects include those that address the effects of globalization and the African diaspora on traditional art in Ghana. He contributed to a group exhibit "REDTAPEONBOTTLENECK" addressing bureaucracy, a work that seeks to introduce the viewer as a participant. He considers this installation a "performance piece" because audience input is included.
His painting "Ashanti Saga" was included in the exhibition "Artists Speak" at the San Diego Museum of Man, on display from May 2007 through February 28, 2008.
Wemega-Kwawu also writes about the politics of cultural dictatorship in the evaluation of modern African art.

Alex Norton

Alexander Hugh "Alex" Norton (born 27 January 1950) is a Scottish actor. He is probably best known for his roles as DCI Matt Burke in "Taggart" and Eddie in the "Renford Rejects".
Personal life.
Norton was born in Househillwood and spent his childhood in Moffat Street in the Gorbals before moving to Pollokshaws. He discovered acting at the age of 14 via an out-of-school drama group. This led to his part in the TV series "Dr. Finlay's Casebook" and with it the decision that acting was what he wanted to concentrate on. Because of his background and his father's lack of approval of his chosen career, Alex decided to avoid the traditional route into acting and instead worked from part to part. In 1973 he became one of the founder members of the company, touring Scotland with "The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black Black Oil". In the 1970s he met his wife, Sally Kinghorn. They met on the set of a BBC Schools series. She and he have 3 sons, Jamie, Rory, and Jock. Also, he was presented with the opportunity to play a part in Peter Jackson's "King Kong" (2005); however, he could not accept because it happened to interfere with the TV project he was currently working on.
Career.
He has appeared in numerous films including Bill Forsyth's "Gregory's Girl" and "Local Hero", Bill Douglas's epic film "Comrades", "Little Voice", "Orphans", and Hollywood blockbusters such as "Patriot Games" with Harrison Ford, "White Hunter, Black Heart", with Clint Eastwood, "Braveheart" starring Mel Gibson, and "" with Johnny Depp. He played Captain Bellamy, a captain of a supposedly haunted ship; a rumor sparked the discovery of Elizabeth Swan's dress on board. Norton's character Bellamy picked up the character of William Turner who was lost at sea. This decision ultimately lead to his death by the Kraken. A fun fact about the character of Captain Bellamy is that he may or may not have been based on an actual eighteenth-century pirate by the name of "Black Sam" Bellamy. This role was perfect for Norton to play because of his Scottish roots. He portrayed a perfectly believable, honest, and logical Scottish Pirate. Norton also voiced Thurston McCondry in the animated shorts Haunted Hogmanay and Glendogie Bogey.
From August to September 2012 he played the role of Gerard Findlay in Waterloo Road, a headteacher from rival school Havelock High.
March 2014 saw him playing Cameron Watts in the "Dead Water" episodes of the BBC, Shetland TV series.
Awards.
Norton has also won two awards for writing. "Extras", an episode of "First Sight" for Channel 4, and "Waiting for Elvis" for STV. He also has an interest in directing. He directed the first production of Tony Roper's "The Steamie", as well as directing Glasgow's King's Theatre's pantomimes for a five-year period.
He has also done voice over work on Medieval Total War II as the voice of some of the Scottish Characters in the game.
He also appeared on The Weakest Link TV Drama Characters Edition. He was the 1st one voted off.
Norton also fronts the STV crime show "Unsolved".

Schwerer Wehrmachtschlepper

The "Schwerer Wehrmachtschlepper" (Heavy Military Tractor), or sWS for short, was a German World War II half-track flat-bed cargo vehicle used in various roles between 1943 and 1945. The unarmored models were used as supply vehicles and as tractors to haul things. The semi-armored version could mount a medium anti-aircraft gun, while the fully armored model carried a 10 barrel rocket launcher ("Nebelwerfer"). Less than a thousand were built before the end of the war, but production continued after the war of an improved model in the Tatra plant in Czechoslovakia.
History.
On 7 May 1942 Hitler ordered development of a simple, low-speed, half-track, load-carrying vehicle for use on the Eastern Front. Büssing-NAG was selected to develop a new tractor ("Zgkw. 5t neuer Art") to replace the earlier 5 tonne Sd.Kfz. 6 and Sd.Kfz. 11 half-tracks, as well as the various lesser-known vehicles of the same class. Production started in December 1943 at Büssing-NAG. Early examples used a truck-like, unarmored cabin similar to the earlier Sd.Kfz. half-tracks it replaced, while later examples featured an armored cabin and engine compartment that looked similar to the famous Sd.Kfz. 251 armored personnel carrier. 
Tatra also joined in production, but together both factories produced only 825 vehicles in total. Tatra continued production of an improved vehicle after the war as the T809.
In addition to the basic cargo role, the vehicle was adapted as a mount for the medium 3.7 cm FlaK 43 anti-aircraft gun, which was placed at the front of the cargo area on a mounting with a large gun shield. The sides of the cargo compartment folded down to give the crew more room to maneuver. Ammunition was carried at the rear of the cargo area. The only other known modification was the "Panzerwerfer 42 auf sWS", a 10-barreled Nebelwerfer 42 rocket launcher placed over an armored ammunition storage compartment; it was built over the cargo area that was intended to replace the 15 cm "Panzerwerfer auf Sf (Sd.Kfz. 4/1)", commonly called the "Maultier".
Armor.
The "Panzerwerfer" mount had armor thick.

Ochyroceratidae

Ochyroceratidae is a six-eyed spider family in the Leptonetoidea superfamily, with 154 described species in 14 genera.
Ochyroceratids are common inhabitants of the tropical forest litter and caves in South Africa, the Caribbean and Asia, especially species rich in the Indo-Pacific, where they constitute one of the ecological counterparts of the Linyphiidae of the northern temperate zone.
They build small, irregular sheet-webs in dark, damp places around leaves, sticks and logs, and typically carry their eggs in their chelicerae until they hatch. Their body length ranges from 0.6 to 3 millimeters. Some species in the subfamily Psilodercinae ("Althepus", "Leclercera") with very long legs are superficially similar to Pholcidae.
At least one species in the genus "Theotima" (the only 0.9mm long "T. minutissima") was shown to be parthenogenetic.

Guestward, Ho!

Guestward, Ho! is an American situation comedy which aired on the ABC network in the 1960-1961 television season, based on the 1956 book of the same title by Patrick Dennis, author of "Auntie Mame".
Background.
"Guestward, Ho!" began as a CBS/Desilu Studios pilot episode for Vivian Vance, who had played Lucille Ball's neighbor, Ethel Mertz, on the hit comedy series "I Love Lucy" and "The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show" from 1951 to 1960. 
Vance played Babs Hooten and veteran film actor Leif Erickson, later of NBC's "The High Chaparral", was cast as her husband, Bill Hooten. On viewing the pilot, network executives felt that Vance had become so typecast in her Ethel Mertz role that she was unconvincing playing a leading character in a situation comedy. One executive was heard to say after screening the episode, "I kept waiting for Lucy to come in." As a result, CBS rejected the pilot, and Vance continued to play her supporting role on "The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show" until the series ended in 1960. 
However, Vance's screen husband on "I Love Lucy", William Frawley, was not so typecast as Fred Mertz because he landed a major role as "Bub" on Fred MacMurray's ABC sitcom, "My Three Sons", which also premiered in 1960.
That same year, "Guestward, Ho!" was taken off the shelf and given two new leads, with movie actress Joanne Dru as Babs Hooten, a former model in the story line, and television actor Mark Miller as Bill Hooten. Child actor Flip Mark was cast as their son, Brook Hooten. This time, the show sold and premiered on the ABC Thursday evening schedule preceding "The Donna Reed Show". It was primarily sponsored by Ralston-Purina, with 7 Up as an alternate sponsor.
Overview.
The premise is a New York City family, the Hootens, tired of the urban lifestyle, relocate to operate a dude ranch in New Mexico. They bought the place unseen, and found it to need considerably more work than they had been led to believe. The Hootens befriend the American Indian "Hawkeye" whose "trading post" was the only source of supplies in the vicinity. Hawkeye, played by J. Carrol Naish, was a rather cynical Indian, who sold Indian-looking trinkets which had been mass-produced in Asia, and frequently read "The Wall Street Journal", seemingly in search of a way to purchase the country and return it to its "rightful owners". Jeanette Nolan guest starred as Mrs. Winslow in the 1961 episode "Hawkeye's First Love". 
Earle Hodgins appeared in at least three episodes as the 67-year-old ranch wrangler named "Lonesome". In the episode "Lonesome's Gal", ZaSu Pitts, formerly of "The Gale Storm Show", played his romantic interest. Jody McCrea, whose "Wichita Town", an NBC western series in which he starred with his father, Joel McCrea, ended in 1960, and he was cast as an Indian, "Danny Brave Eagle", in the 1961 episode entitled "The Wrestler".
The second episode, after the pilot, is entitled "You Can't Go Home Again", borrowing from Thomas Wolfe's novel, "You Can't Go Home Again". The series finale is named "No Place Like Home".
The program ran opposite NBC's "Outlaws", with Barton MacLane and Don Collier. "Guestward, Ho!" was replaced in the fall of 1961 by the relocation of ABC's "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet".

Frank Tate (educator)

Frank Tate CMG (18 June 1864 – 28 June 1939) was an Australian educationist who is best remembered for his efforts in expanding secondary education in Victoria, Australia.
Early life.
Tate was born at Mopoke Gully, near Castlemaine, Victoria, the son of Aristides Franklin (usually called Henry) Tate, a storekeeper, and his wife Mary Bessy, "née" Lomas, both English born. Frank Tate was educated at the Castlemaine State School, the Old Model School, Melbourne, and the University of Melbourne (B.A., 1888; M.A., 1894). Tate entered the teachers' training college in 1883 and gained the trained teacher's certificate with first and second honours. His first charge was a small school near East Kew on the outskirts of Melbourne. He quickly made an impression as an able and stimulating young teacher and many students were sent to his school for teaching experience. 
Career.
In 1889 Tate was appointed a junior lecturer in the training college and became much interested in teaching methods. At the end of 1893, following the great financial crisis, the college was closed, but Tate was given charge of classes in Melbourne for the training of pupil teachers. In 1895 after an Education Department reshuffle, Tate was appointed an inspector for the Charlton district, and spent four years inspecting its 136 schools and incidentally learning a great deal about the problems of small rural schools and their teachers. Tate became a well-known speaker at teachers' congresses and enhanced his reputation as an educationist when giving evidence before the technical education commission. 
Tate was appointed principal of the Melbourne Training College when it was re-opened in February 1900, and vigorously set to work to make up as far as possible the ground lost while the college was closed. Tate kept the subject of English in his own hands, considering it to be the basic subject of education, and steadily brought before his students the opportunities for service to the community possessed by enlightened teachers. In March 1902 when it was announced that he had been appointed as the first director of education in Victoria he was only 38 years old. Many men of much longer service had been passed over, but it appears to have been generally recognized that he was the fit man for the position.
When Tate took up his directorship, education in Victoria had long been starved and neglected. The state had been going through a period of lean years, but the new director felt that money spent on education would more than repay itself. Tate felt too that well-educated and capable men and women could not be attracted to an ill-paid profession with little prospect of promotion. He set out to do away with pupil-teachers, to improve the training of teachers, to obtain better pay for them, to encourage school committees, and to suggest to each community that the local state school was not merely a state school--it was their school. New methods of instruction were brought in, the chief object being the development of a child's mind instead of merely cramming it with facts. Tate felt too that secondary and technical education was being neglected and in June 1904 presented a report on "Some Aspects of Education in New Zealand" in which he showed how far behind Victoria was lagging in this field.
In 1905 a bill was introduced in the Victorian parliament for the registration of teachers and schools not administered by the education department. This was passed and had much effect in raising the qualifications and status of secondary school teachers. When it was determined that Tate should attend the conference on education held in London in May 1907 he took the opportunity of making a special study of these problems in Europe and the United States of America. Soon after his return he published a "Preliminary Report upon Observations made during an Official Visit to Europe and America" (1908). In this report he showed that a "ladder of education" was required. Primary schools formed a necessary basis, but on these must be imposed higher elementary schools, secondary schools and agricultural high schools, all leading on to the university or agricultural college. Technical colleges for young people engaged in industry must also be much more encouraged. In a striking diagram he showed that of the money spent by the state of Victoria on education 93.1% was for primary education and less than one per cent for secondary education. In another diagram he demonstrated that New Zealand, whose population was 20% less than that of Victoria, was spending three times as much on technical education and over ten times as much on secondary education. 
Tate persisted in his fight for a better state of things and gradually imposed his views on parliament. In the education act of 1910 which Tate drafted, provision was made for the constitution of a council of public education. It consisted of representatives of the university, the education department, technical schools, public and private schools, and industrial interests. Its duties were to report to the minister upon public education in other countries, and matters in connexion with public education referred to it by the minister. It also took over the duties of the teachers and schools registration board. The discussions of this council have proved of great value in the consideration of problems of public education in Victoria. Tate was chairman of this committee, and he also remained in touch with the university as a member of its council.
Late life and legacy.
When Tate retired from the education department in 1928 no fewer than 128 higher elementary schools and 36 high schools had been established in Victoria, and there had been an increase of 50 per cent in the number of technical schools. Tate had also paid two visits to London and had sat on commissions dealing with education in New Zealand, Fiji, and Southern Rhodesia. After his retirement in 1928, Tate became president (1930–39) of the Australian Council for Educational Research and never lost his interest in educational problems. 
Tate died at Caulfield, Melbourne on 28 June 1939; he had married Ada Hodgkiss on 2 October 1888, who died in 1932, and was survived by two sons and a daughter of their six children. The Imperial Service Order was conferred on him in 1903 and he was created C.M.G. in 1919. In addition to the reports mentioned Tate edited "As You Like It in the Australasian Shakespeare" (1916), and in 1920 published as a pamphlet, "Continued Education, Our Opportunity and our Obligation". Tate was a good popular lecturer on Shakespearian and other subjects. 
The Secondary Teachers College Hostel is named 'Frank Tate House'. There is also a building at The University of Melbourne's Parkville campus named after him.

Northbrook Court

Northbrook Court is a very large, upscale Super-regional Mall in Northbrook, Illinois. The mall is one of the most upscale collection of shops in the United States serving the North Shore suburbs of Chicago. Located on its three anchor stores are Lord & Taylor, Macy's, and Neiman Marcus. There is also a 14-screen AMC Theatres on the south side of the mall, as well as a free standing Crate & Barrel home store in the northwest corner of the property. It is located on Lake Cook Road (Cook County Trunk Highway A50), between the Tri-State Tollway (Interstate 94/294) and Edens Expressway (Interstate 94/U.S. Highway 41) and is managed and co-owned by General Growth Properties.
History.
Opened in 1976, Northbrook Court was originally anchored by Neiman Marcus, I. Magnin, Lord & Taylor and Sears. The mall had been developed by a Sears subsidiary, Homart Development). I. Magnin closed in 1992 and was demolished for the construction of a General Cinema multiplex theater. Sears closed in the 1980s and was replaced by JCPenney, which in turn closed in 1992 and was razed, and replaced by Marshall Field's which opened in 1995. Marshall Fields was converted into Macy's in 2006. 
Before the mall was remodeled in the mid 1990s, movement between the two level structure was either by stairs or winding spiral walkways. Escalators were installed in the early 90s.
In 1998 General Growth Properties acquired the mall in a private transaction from the Grosvenor Group, contributing it in 1999 to a 50/50 joint venture with the New York State Common Retirement Fund (NYSCRF), while retaining management. The General Cinema was acquired by AMC Theatres in 2001, while outside the mall, a freestanding Crate & Barrel home furnishings store was opened in 2002.
The General Cinema became the successor to Deerbook Maill's four theater location in 1997. 
The Food Court has undergone a number of changes over the years. Once home to perennial favorites McDonalds and Love's Yogurt, as well as One Potato, Two Potato, in 2007, the dining underwent another change to create a more restaurant like atmosphere. 
Today, Northbrook Court is home to more than 110 upscale retailers including Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Cole Haan, Cusp, and Stuart Weitzman. Northbrook is also noted for its spa choices. Most notably, Elizabeth Arden Red Door and Sassoon.
The 1985 movie "Weird Science" contained a scene that took place at the mall in which a red Icee was poured on Gary and Wyatt from one floor above them. Also, scenes from the 1980 movie "Ordinary People" filmed on the escalators, the women's clothing section, and the Zodiac restaurant at Neiman-Marcus, showing Mary Tyler Moore's character, Beth, and Donald Sutherland's character Calvin, in their public personae.

Isidoro Ocampo

Isidoro Ocampo (20 June 1910, Veracruz — 4 February 1983, Mexico City) was a Mexican artist of the Mexican Muralism era, best known for his graphic work. Much of his career was dedicated to teaching, which kept his artistic output down, but he was also a founding member of the Taller de Gráfica Popular and the Sociedad Mexicana de Grabadores as well as member of the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios and the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana.
Life.
Ocampo was born Isidoro Ocampo Vidal in the city of Veracruz on Mexico’s Gulf Coast to Medarno Ocampo and María Vidal. His very early childhood was spent with his father, who was a lighthouse keeper, but when he was five, he was sent to Mexico City to begin his primary education.
Ocampo had been drawing since age ten, but the family’s economic needs had his father send him on to study commerce. However, Ocampo rebelled and began to study art at the Academy of San Carlos at night from 1928 to 1932. Engraving and printmaking became his main specialty, learning techniques in wood, metal and stone. Because of his exemplary coursework, he was named a teaching assistant at San Carlos. Ocampo also went on to study at the Escuela de Artes del Libro with Francisco Díaz de León and Carlos Alvarado Lang, learning lithography with Emilio Amero.
Ocampo had his life and career in Mexico City, dying at his home there at age 72 from cardiac arrest. He was buried at the San Lorenzo Tezonco Cemetery in Iztapalapa.
Career.
Ocampo was one of Mexico’s important printmaker in the first half of the 20th century. Although he began painting in 1932, his primary activity remained the graphic arts. In 1932, he left San Carlos to work at the state-run publisher Editorial Imprenta Cultural, illustrating twenty eight book over seven years, also producing lithographs, etchings and woodcuts.
In the 1930s, he also began teaching classes in art, dedicating thirty two years of his life teaching drawing and painting as the various art schools and classes for beginners sponsored by the Secretaría de Educación Pública, primarily in middle schools and night classes for adults. He also taught at the Escuela de Bellas Artes and Academy of San Carlos. This teaching work kept the production of his own artwork down.
Much of Ocampo’s graphic production was in association with various workshops. In 1936, he became a member of the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (LEAR), collaborating on an adult literacy project. In 1937, he was a founding member of the Taller de Gráfica Popular (TGP), dedicated to works with political and social themes but was one of the few there that did not openly support communism through his work. He left this organization in 1940 because of a dispute over the pricing of prints caused a schism. He rejoined for a short time but left for good in 1944. Despite the problems, his work was included a 1946 TGP publication called “Mexican People” and participated in the group’s three shows in the United States. In 1948, he was a founding member of the Sociedad Mexicana de Grabadores and in 1949 became involved with the Sociedad para el Impulso de las Artes Plásticas.
In 1947 he published an album of ten prints from woodcuts, copied by hand.
Ocampo had his first formal exhibition of his work in 1941 along with Gonzalo de la Paz Pérez and Raúl Anguiano. He exhibited his work In Mexico, the rest of the Americas and Europe. For a number of years he exhibited his work with the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana, of which he was a member, and participated in inter-American Biennials in engraving and painting. His most important exhibitions include 20 Centuries of Mexican Art in New York (1938), Sociedad Mexicana de Grabadores in Tokyo (1959), Exhibition of Mexican Art at the Mexican Consulate General in San Antonio, Texas (1959) and Isidoro Ocampo, Maestro, grabador y pintor at the Palacio de Bellas Artes (1973) . Other art competitions he participated in include the III Bienal Interamericana de Pintura y Grabado in 1958-1960 and the II Bienal Americana de Grabado in 1965.
Artistry.
Isidoro Ocampo was both a graphic artist and painter but was best known for his graphic work. His formation as an artist was shaped by the then-dominant Mexican School of Painting or Muralism Movement, with its emphasis on art as a political and social force. His work was strongly influenced by that of José Guadalupe Posada, Leopoldo Méndez and José Clemente Orozco in both theme and technique, with his graphic work compared to that of David Alfaro Siqueiros. Other influences included the works of Honoré Daumier, Francisco Goya, and Pablo Picasso. Both his graphic and easel works are Expressionistic, especially those with themes related to struggle, injustice and ping along with popular scenes. He was noted for his use of mostly primary colors.
He was inclined toward humanistic themes and social issues and how they are expressed in art, believing that art should serve social ends, especially advocating for the poor. One major theme was poverty but also issues such as fascism. He was an observer of urban life in Mexico and one of few printmakers to create images of workers at leisure.

Breed All About It

Breed All About It was a show that headlined one breed of dog, or a group of dogs, and presented facts and advice about that breed. It was aired Animal Planet. The series was hosted by Cam "Buzz" Brainard.
Earlier episodes of the series were significantly different from later episodes because they were produced for non-commercial broadcast on networks like the BBC networks and PBS. After the show moved to Animal Planet permanently, episodes became more structured, with specific segments dealing with different aspects of the dog breed. Sectioned included a general introduction, the breed's history, specific health concerns for that breed, an offbeat or humorous segment featuring the unique traits of the breed, and a summary guide for what prospective owners should know about the breed.
Occasionally segments within episodes would feature one or more celebrities who own the featured dog breed, including their testimonials about life with their dogs. Some of the celebrities featured on "Breed All About It" include Susan Ford and her Golden Retrievers, Greg Louganis and his Great Danes, Lorrie Morgan and her Japanese Chins, and Andrew Weil and his Rhodesian Ridgebacks.
It is unknown if "Breed All About It" will return to air after the show ended on January 1, 2010. However, the Animal Planet website has archived video clips of individual dog breeds.

Jeff Dwire

George Jefferson "Jeff" Dwire (June 6, 1923 – August, 1974) was an Arkansas small businessman and the third husband of Virginia Clinton Kelley, and a stepfather of former United States President Bill Clinton and of Roger Clinton, Jr..
Early life.
He was born in Bodcaw, Arkansas. A veteran of World War II, Dwire was injured during a parachute jump and had later worked as a carpenter. He had worked his way through college as a hairdresser. Other occupations and avocations included playing football, teaching judo, building homes, and selling oil-well equipment and securities.
Marriage.
Dwire, who had three daughters from a previous marriage, met Kelley when she patronized the beauty salon he owned. They married on 3 January 1969 in Hope, Arkansas; the ceremony was performed by the Rev. John Miles, and Bill Clinton served as the best man. He also played and sang at the reception and earlier watched the Chicago Democratic convention on television with Dwire. Family and friends of the bride discouraged the union because Dwire was an ex-convict, having served nine months in prison in 1962 for stock fraud.
Dwire and the Clinton Family.
Hillary Clinton, then Hillary Rodham, described Dwire as a "supportive ally" in her attempts to forge a relationship with Bill Clinton's mother while Rodham was dating the future president. He also counseled Clinton concerning the draft, decisions involving which would become a major issue in his presidential campaign. Since Dwire and his new wife married later in life, the prospects of having children together were not favorable. At that time, Clarice Minner, their young babysitter and housekeeper, became pregnant with her second child. On October 12, 1969, with Virginia Dwire at her side as the anesthesiologist, she gave birth to a little girl. She named her daughter "Jeffrey" Lynn Smith as a sign of adoration to the couple.
Death.
Dwire died in 1974 of complications of diabetes.
Legacy.
A 1967 Ford Mustang that he bought played a role in the 1992 presidential campaign and was a favorite nostalgia item of Bill Clinton. It is currently on display at the Museum of Automobiles in Arkansas. The Clinton family's housekeeper at the time Clarice Minner Hay, who was expecting a child, had so much admiration for the family that she named her daughter after Jeff. Her child subsequently became Jeffery Lynn Smith. Sadly enough Jeffery went missing three weeks before Christmas in 1985 while walking home from school in Hot Springs, Arkansas. She was 15 years old.[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/murray222%40prodigy.net/Lynnspage.html&date=2009-10-26+02:22:02][http://youtube.com/watch?v=I4Ib1qYusxI][http://arkansasmatters.com/media_player.php?media_id=62061#]

Henry Tate (poet)

Henry Tate (27 October 1873 - 6 June 1926) was an Australian poet and musician.
Henry Tate was born in Prahran, Melbourne, the son of Henry Tate, an accountant. He was educated at a local state school and as a choir boy at a St Kilda Anglican church, and learned music under Marshall Hall. He worked as a clerk before becoming a music teacher. Tate had fewer pupils than he might, however, for he would not encourage a child with no talent, and did not believe in coaching children for music examinations. 
Literary work.
Tate contributed verse to "The Bulletin" and other journals, and wrote a weekly chess column for a Melbourne newspaper. In 1910 he published "The Rune of the Bunyip and other Verse", and in 1917 a pamphlet, "Australian Musical Resources, Some Suggestions", in which he demonstrated the possibility of the developing an Australian school of musical composers with a distinctive national character. He extended this argument in "Australian Musical Possibilities", published in Melbourne in 1924. That year he became music critic for "The Age".
Musical compositions.
Tate's "Bush Miniatures" was played in Melbourne in 1925. The more ambitious "Dawn, an Australian rhapsody for full orchestra with a melodic and rhythmic foundation based on Australian bird calls", was later performed by the university symphony orchestra under Bernard Heinze and was favourably received by both critics and the public.
Death.
The value of Tate's work had scarcely begun to be appreciated when he died after a short illness on 6 June 1926. He was survived by his wife Violet Eleanor, née Mercer. They had no children. His poems were collected and published in 1928 with a portrait and an introduction by Elsie Cole.

Heat advisory

A Heat Advisory is issued by the National Weather Service of the United States within 12 hours of the heat index reaching one of two criteria levels. In most areas, an advisory will be issued if there is a heat index of at least 105°F but less than 115°F for less than 3 hours per day and/or if nighttime low temperatures are above 80°F for 2 consecutive days. Note that local offices, particularly those where excessive heat is less frequent or in areas with deserts or mountainous terrain, often have their own criteria. High values of the heat index are caused by temperatures being significantly above normal and high humidities, and such high levels can pose a threat to human life through conditions such as heat stroke.

Nada Dimić

Nada Dimić (September 6, 1923 - March 17, 1942) was a Yugoslav communist who died in World War II and was proclaimed a People's Hero of Yugoslavia.
Nada Dimić was born in Divoselo near Gospić, Croatia to an ethnic Serb family. She finished four grades of elementary school in Gospić, and then moved to Zemun for another four grades of gymnasium and one year of the economics academy. In 1938 she joined the Communist Youth, and in 1940 the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.
When Yugoslavia was invaded during World War II, in June 1941 she joined the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment, the first Partisan unit in Croatia. The same year, the Ustasha police arrested her in Sisak, but as they transferred her to the prison in Zagreb, she swallowed poison in order to avoid interrogation. It did not kill her, but she was soon rescued by the Zagreb cell of the Party, and transferred to the Partisan-controlled areas of Kordun.
When she recovered from the poisoning, she went to Karlovac where she worked as an undercover agent for the Partisans. She was eventually caught by the Italians who surrendered her to the Ustaša police on December 3, 1941, which then tortured her. She refused to give them any information, and was sent to the Stara Gradiška concentration camp in February 1942. She was murdered there a month later, aged 18.
She was awarded the title of People's Hero of Yugoslavia after the war (on July 7, 1951). A (now defunct) textile factory in Zagreb was named after her.

Cabrillo High School (Lompoc, California)

Cabrillo High School serves students of Vandenberg Village, the city of Lompoc, and Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County, on the California Central Coast.
History.
The school was founded in 1965 by the Lompoc Unified School District. Built to serve the residents of Vandenberg Air Force Base, Vandenberg Village, and the northern Lompoc Valley, Cabrillo answered the sudden population boom during the late 1950s and 1960s, a result of the booming space program at Vandenberg. Named for the early Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, the school board of Lompoc chose the Conquistador to be the mascot of the new high school in the early 1960s, with the black and gold of the first Spanish Californian flags as the school colors. In 2001, Cabrillo opened up its Aquarium Room to the public. In 2007 the California Department of Education awarded Cabrillo as one of the winners for a California Distinguished School Award, as well as 171 other schools in California.
Administration.
The first school year on campus was 1965–66, with Camillo Wilde as the principal. Wilde would leave during the second school year to assume the position of Lompoc Unified School District Superintendent, and he was succeeded by assistant principal Robert Bickford, who would serve until the late 1970s. Wilde would return for a second stint as principal in 1978. There have been six principals since Wilde's retiring in the mid-1980s: Dr. Debra Bradley (1986–1993), Mr. John Lemon (1993–1999), Mr. Jeff Carlovsky (1999–2003), Dr. Fred Manzo (2003–2005), Ms. Betty McCallum (2005–2008), Mrs. Lore Desmond (2008–present). The current vice principals are Schel Brown, and Jeff Wagonseller.
Sports.
Cabrillo High School has won 13 CIF SS championships in 8 sports, including boys' basketball (1979), boys' cross country (2004), boys' track & field (1983, 1985, 1986, 1990, 1991), boys' water polo (1976, 1996), girls' track & field (1986), softball (1976, 1985), wrestling (1988), and women's water polo (2007). Cabrillo High has seen much success in aquatics, with a combined 62 league titles in boys' swimming (17 titles), boys' water polo (28 titles), girls' swimming (9 titles), and girls' water polo (8 titles).
Arts.
Since the employment of long time designer Scott Schaller, there has been a booming graphic design program at the school, pulling in a large majority of the school's annual scholarships from colleges. The program also graduates the most students that go straight to a four year school in their trade, and is connected with the photography department by way of the yearbook committee.

Yolŋu languages

Yolŋu Matha is a cover term for the languages of the Yolngu (Yolŋu), the Indigenous people of northeast Arnhem Land in northern Australia. (Yolŋu = people, Matha = tongue, language).
Yolngu languages have a fortis–lenis contrast in plosive consonants. Lenis/short plosives have weak contact and intermittent voicing, while fortis/long plosives have full closure, a more powerful release burst, and no voicing.
Varieties.
Yolŋu Matha consists of about six mutually intelligible languages divided into about thirty clan varieties and perhaps twelve different dialects, each with its own Yolŋu name. Put together, there are about 4600 speakers of Yolŋu Matha. While there is extensive variation between these dialects, there is generally common mutual intelligibility, hence the umbrella group of Yolngu Matha. The linguistic situation is very complicated, since each of the 30 or so clans also has a named language variety. Dixon (2002) distinguishes the following:
Bowern (2011) adds the varieties in parentheses as distinct languages.

George Sutton Titheradge

George Sutton Titheradge (9 December 1848 – 22 January 1916) was an English-Australian actor.
Titheradge was born at Portsea, Portsmouth, England, eldest son of George Robert Titheradge (an accountant) and Sarah Isabelle Emblim. He made his first appearance on the stage at the Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, subsequently supported Charles Dillon in Shakespearian plays, and in 1873 played the junior lead at Bristol. In 1876 he was Joseph Surface in the Chippendale classical company, and in the same year played Hamlet at Calcutta. On 1 January 1877 he was the Herald at the Calcutta Durbar and proclaimed Queen Victoria Empress of India. He made his first appearance in London on 6 October 1877, and on 8 April 1878 played Iago to the Othello of Henry Forrester.
Titheradge visited India a second time and, going on to Australia, made his first appearance there in May 1879 as Lord Arthur Chilton in "False Shame". He joined the London Comedy Company at Sydney in 1880. After a world tour including the United States, Titheradge was engaged in 1883 by James Cassius Williamson and Garner to come to Australia and play Wilfred Denver in "The Silver King". He made a great success in this character, and in leading parts in other popular dramas of the period. He joined the Brough and Boucicault company in 1887, and for ten years played lead in plays by Robertson, Grundy, Jones, Pinero and other dramatists of the period. There was one Shakespearian production, "Much Ado About Nothing", in which Titheradge was an excellent Benedick to the Beatrice of Mrs Brough.
Titheradge must have played something like 100 parts in Australia, not one without distinction, and many seemed almost faultless. Possibly his Aubrey Tanqueray and Village Priest returned most often to the memories of play-goers of the time. He went to London in 1898, and played with success with Mrs Patrick Campbell, including his old part of Aubrey Tanqueray, and was with her company in America in 1902, among his parts being Schwartze in "Magda." In January 1903 he played Professor Rubeck at the Imperial Theatre, London, in Ibsen's "When We Dead Awaken", and later in the year toured America with Henry Miller and Margaret Anglin in "Camille," "The Devil's Disciple," and other plays. He was in the United States again late in 1905, and toured with Sothern and Julia Marlowe.
In England in 1907 Titheradge was with Sir John Hare's company in "Caste" by Thomas W. Robertson and "A Pair of Spectacles" by Sydney Grundy. He returned to Australia in 1908 and in that year and in 1909 played in "The Thief," "The Taming of the Shrew," "The Village Priest," "The Silver King", and other plays. There was a benefit performance for him in December 1910 at which George Rignold made his last appearance. During the remainder of his life Titheradge made only occasional appearances, among them being in "The Village Priest," with Mrs Brough in 1912, Shylock to the Portia of Ellen Terry at her benefit at Sydney in 1914, and George II in a Lewis Waller production of "A Fair Highwayman." He died at Sydney on 22 January 1916.
He married Isabella Maria Murdoch in 1871, and there were three children of the marriage. Following a divorce in 1884, he married Alma Santon. They had a son and six daughters, of whom Madge Titheradge, born in Melbourne in 1887, made a reputation as an actress in London, playing many leading parts. The son, Dion Titheradge, born in Melbourne in 1889, after experience as an actor in Australia, U.S.A., and England, became well known as a producer and author of many plays and scenarios.

<doc id="5899910" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5899910" title="Caribbean reef shark">
Caribbean reef shark

The Caribbean reef shark ("Carcharhinus perezi") is a species of requiem shark, family Carcharhinidae. It is found in the tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Brazil, and is the most commonly encountered reef shark in the Caribbean Sea. With a robust, streamlined body typical of the requiem sharks, this species is difficult to tell apart from other large members of its family such as the dusky shark ("C. obscurus") and the silky shark ("C. falciformis"). Distinguishing characteristics include dusky-colored fins without prominent markings, a short free rear tip on the second dorsal fin, and tooth shape and number.
Measuring up to 3 m (10 ft) long, the Caribbean reef shark is one of the largest apex predators in the reef ecosystem, feeding on a variety of fishes and cephalopods. They have been documented resting motionless on the sea bottom or inside caves, unusual behavior for an active-swimming shark. If threatened, it may perform a threat display in which it frequently changes direction and dips its pectoral fins. Like other requiem sharks, it is viviparous with females giving birth to 4–6 young every other year. Caribbean reef sharks are of some importance to fisheries as a source of meat, leather, liver oil, and fishmeal, but recently they have become more valuable as an ecotourist attraction. In the Bahamas and elsewhere, bait is used to attract them to groups of divers in controversial "shark feedings". This species is responsible for a small number of attacks on humans.
Taxonomy and phylogeny.
The Caribbean reef shark was originally described as "Platypodon perezi" by Felipe Poey in 1876, in the scientific journal "Anales de la Sociedad Española de Historia Natural". The type specimens were six individuals caught off the coast of Cuba. The genus "Platypodon" was synonymized with "Carcharhinus" by later authors.
Based on morphological similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped this species with the bignose shark ("C. altimus") and the sandbar shark ("C. plumbeus"), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed it as the sister species of the grey reef shark ("C. amblyrhynchos"). A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos shark ("C. galapagensis"), dusky shark ("C. obscurus"), oceanic whitetip shark ("C. longimanus"), and the blue shark ("Prionace glauca"). However, more work is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within "Carcharhinus".
Distribution and habitat.
The Caribbean reef shark occurs throughout the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina in the north to Brazil in the south, including Bermuda, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. However, it is extremely rare north of the Florida Keys. It prefers shallow waters on or around coral reefs, and is commonly found near the drop-offs at the reefs' outer edges. This shark is most common in water shallower than , but has been known to dive to 378 m (1240 feet).
Description.
A heavy-bodied shark with a "typical" streamlined shape, the Caribbean reef shark is difficult to distinguish from other large requiem shark species. It usually measures 2–2.5 m (6.5–8 ft) long; the maximum recorded length is 3 m (10 ft) and the maximum reported weight is 70 kg (154 lbs). The coloration is dark gray or gray-brown above and white or white-yellow below, with an inconspicuous white band on the flanks. The fins are not prominently marked, and the undersides of the paired fins, the anal fin, and the lower lobe of the caudal fin are dusky.
The snout is rather short, broad, and rounded, without prominent flaps of skin beside the nostrils. The eyes are large and circular, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). There are 11–13 tooth rows in either half of both jaws. The teeth have broad bases, serrated edges, and narrow cusps; the front 2–4 teeth on each side are erect and the others increasingly oblique. The five pairs of gill slits are moderately long, with the third gill slit over the origin of the pectoral fins. The first dorsal fin is high and falcate (sickle-shaped). There is a low interdorsal ridge running behind it to the second dorsal fin, which is relatively large with a short free rear tip. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over or slightly forward of the free rear tips of the pectoral fins, and that of the second dorsal fin lies over or slightly forward of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are long and narrow, tapering to a point. The dermal denticles are closely spaced and overlapping, each with five (sometimes seven in large individuals) horizontal low ridges leading to marginal teeth.
Biology and ecology.
Despite its abundance in certain areas, the Caribbean reef shark is one of the least-studied large requiem sharks. They are believed to play a major role in shaping Caribbean reef communities. These sharks are more active at night, with no evidence of seasonal changes in activity or migration. Juveniles tend to remain in a localized area throughout the year, while adults range over a wider area.
Caribbean reef sharks are sometimes seen resting motionless on the sea floor or inside caves; it is the first active shark species in which such a behavior was reported. In 1975, Eugenie Clark investigated the famed "sleeping sharks" inside the caves at Isla Mujeres off the Yucatan Peninsula, and determined that the sharks were not actually asleep as their eyes would follow divers. Clark speculated that freshwater upwellings inside the caves might loosen parasites on the sharks and produce an enjoyable "narcotic" effect. If threatened, Caribbean reef sharks sometimes perform a threat display, in which they swim in a short, jerky fashion with frequent changes in direction and repeated, brief (1–1.2 second duration) drops of the pectoral fins. This display is less pronounced than the better-known display of the grey reef shark ("C. amblyrhynchos").
Juvenile Caribbean reef sharks are preyed upon by larger sharks such as the tiger shark ("Galeocerdo cuvier") and the bull shark ("C. leucas"). Few parasites are known for this species; one is a dark variegated leech often seen trailing from its first dorsal fin. Off northern Brazil, juveniles seek out cleaning stations occupied by yellownose gobies ("Elacatinus randalli"), which clean the sharks of parasites while they lie still on the bottom. Horse-eye jacks ("Caranx latus") and bar jacks ("Carangoides ruber") routinely school around Caribbean reef sharks.
Feeding.
The Caribbean reef shark feeds on a wide variety of reef-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods, as well as some elasmobranchs such as eagle rays ("Aetobatus narinari") and yellow stingrays ("Urobatis jamaicensis"). It is attracted to low-frequency sounds, which are indicative of struggling fish. In one observation of a 2 m (6.6 ft) long male Caribbean reef shark hunting a yellowtail snapper ("Lutjanus crysurus"), the shark languidly circled and made several seemingly "half-hearted" turns towards its prey, before suddenly accelerating and swinging its head sideways to capture the snapper at the corner of its jaws. Young sharks feed on small fishes, shrimps, and crabs. Caribbean reef sharks are capable of everting their stomachs, which likely serves to cleanse indigestible particles, parasites, and mucus from the stomach lining.
Life history.
Reproduction is viviparous; once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which they receive nourishment from their mother. Mating is apparently an aggressive affair, as females are often found with biting scars and wounds on their sides. At the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago and Atol das Rocas off Brazil, parturition takes place at the end of the dry season from February to April, while at other locations in the Southern Hemisphere, females give birth during the Amazon summer in November and December. The average litter size is four to six, with a gestation period of one year. Females become pregnant every other year. The newborns measure no more than 74 cm (29 in) long; males mature sexually at 1.5–1.7 m (60–66 in) long and females at 2–3 m (79–116 in).
Human interactions.
Normally shy or indifferent to the presence of divers, the Caribbean reef shark has been known to become aggressive in the presence of food and grows sufficiently large to be considered potentially dangerous. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 27 attacks attributable to this species, 4 of them unprovoked, and none fatal.
This species is taken by commercial and artisanal longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. It is valued for meat, leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. The Caribbean reef shark is the most common shark landed in Colombia (accounting for 39% of the longline catch by occurrence), where it is utilized for its fins, oil, and jaws (sold for ornamental purposes). In Belize, this species is mainly caught as bycatch on hook-and-line intended for groupers and snappers; the fins are sold to the lucrative Asian market and the meat sold in Belize, Mexico, and Guatemala to make "panades", a tortilla-like confection. A dedicated shark fishery operated in Belize from the mid-1900s to the early 1990s, until catches of all species saw dramatic declines. The flesh of this species may contain high levels of methylmercury and other heavy metals.
Shark feeding.
A profitable ecotourism industry has arisen around this species involving organized "shark feeds", in which groups of reef sharks are attracted to divers using bait. Some US$6,000,000 is spent annually on shark viewing in the Bahamas, where at some sites a single living Caribbean reef shark has a value between US$13,000 and US$40,000 (compared to a one-time value of US$50–60 for a dead shark). This practice has drawn controversy, as opponents argue that the sharks may learn to associate humans with food, increasing the chances of a shark attack, and that the removal of reef fishes for bait may damage the local ecosystem. Conversely, proponents maintain that shark feeds contribute to conservation by incentivizing the protection of sharks and educating people about them. Thus far, there has been little evidence that shark feeds have increased the risk of attack in the surrounding area. Shark feeding has been outlawed off the coast of Florida, but continues at other locations in the Caribbean.
Conservation.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the Caribbean reef shark as Near Threatened; its population has declined off Belize and Cuba from overfishing and exploitation continues in other regions. They are also threatened by the degradation and destruction of their coral reef habitat. Commercial fishing for this species is prohibited in United States waters. They are protected in the Bahamas due to their significance to ecotourism, as well as in a number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) off Brazil and elsewhere. However, enforcement against illegal fishing is lacking in some of these reserves, and many areas in which this species is abundant are not yet protected.

Quaker Instant Oatmeal

Quaker Instant Oatmeal (Instant Quaker Oatmeal until 1995) is a type of oatmeal made by the Quaker Oats Company.
Preparation.
Quaker Instant Oatmeal comes in 1.5 oz (43 g) single-serving packets and is usually flavored. Flavorings include cinnamon and apple, honey, and other "sweet" styles. The oatmeal is prepared by mixing with boiling water and stirring, hence being referred to as "instant"; once mixed, the oatmeal is ready within a minute. It can also be prepared by adding up to 2/3 cup of water and microwaving for 30-60 seconds. Milk may also be used.
Taste.
Although quick and easy to make, the resulting oatmeal is not the same as traditional oatmeal. Quaker Instant Oatmeal has a different taste than oatmeal prepared the traditional way. This is due to how the oatmeal is processed and prepared. The mouthfeel of the oatmeal is changed as the oatmeal is finely milled to decrease cooking time, and the oatmeal is treated with chemical preservatives and flavorants.

Big bend slider

The Big Bend Slider ("Trachemys gaigeae") is a species of aquatic turtle native to the United States in the states of New Mexico and Texas, and northern Mexico in the state of Chihuahua. It is found primarily in the Rio Grande and Rio Conchos river systems. The epithet "gaigeae" is in honor of the American herpetologist, Helen Beulah Thompson Gaige, who collected the first specimen in the Big Bend region of Texas in 1928.[http://ebeltz.net/herps/biogappx.html] The species was first described by professor of zoology at the University of Michigan, Dr. Norman Edouard Hartweg in 1939. It was for a time considered to be a species of Cooter, genus "Pseudemys", and then a subspecies of the Pond Slider, "Trachemys scripta", but it was granted full species status, though many sources still refer to it by its various synonyms.
Behavior.
Primarily aquatic, they are often seen basking on rocks or logs in the water, and when approached quickly dive to the bottom. They only time they spend a large amount of time on land is when the females emerge to lay their eggs. They are an omnivorous species, with younger animals being more carnivorous, and progressively becoming more herbivorous as they age, with older adults being nearly entirely herbivorous. Adults 5 to 11 inches long.

Miriam Van Waters

Miriam Van Waters (1887–1974) was a noted early American feminist social worker and served as superintendent of the Massachusetts Reformatory for Women at Framingham (1932–1957). Estelle Freedman wrote a biography of Van Waters in the mid-nineties, and provided historical and social context for her professional work as social worker and prison superintendent in her earlier social history of women's prisons.
Early Life and Professional Career.
Miriam Van Waters was a liberal mainline Protestant Christian, daughter to a member of the clergy, Rev. George Browne Van Waters, an Episcopalian priest. She was a practitioner of the "Social Gospel" associated with that current of Christian faith, and believed in prisoner rehabilitation as an important element within a broader context of social reform. She earned a doctorate in anthropology from Clark University, then went on to work as a probation officer at the Boston Children's Aid Society. With other female social reformers, she developed a number of specialist juvenile rehabilitation and reform facilities in California, such as the Frazer Detention Home (Portland, Oregon) and El Retiro School for Girls (Los Angeles), which sought to assist girls to develop self-esteem and embark on the road to rehabilitated social behavior. She also served as a referee at the Los Angeles Juvenile Court.
Massachusetts Reformatory for Women: 1932-1957.
In 1932, Van Waters began a long-term appointment as superintendent at the Massachusetts Reformatory for Women at Framingham, succeeding Jessie Donaldson Hodder. She served as superintendent of that institution for the next quarter-century. Most of the inmates were serving time for prostitution, extramarital sex, or alcoholism. Her feminist principles led to an emphasis on rehabilitation during her period as superintendent, and are reflected in her active staff recruitment programmes. She developed a donor base amongst female philanthropists, including Eleanor Roosevelt, Jane Addams, Margaret Mead, Ethel Sturges Dummer, and Frances Perkins.
While inmates worked on industrial concerns like manufacturing clothing and flags, or working in the kitchens and prison farm unit, Van Waters also developed educational opportunities for the inmates, such as an art and crafts course, literary class, drama class, prison newspaper, hikers club and a parole club, which networked with other Massachusetts social reform and rehabilitation agencies outside the prison. She also pioneered separate accommodation for younger inmates as well as nursing mothers, who were allowed to keep their children with them until the latter were fostered out at two years of age. When the state legislature tried to separate infants from nursing mothers, Van Waters successfully lobbied against the proposed legislation.
Van Waters was also a closeted lesbian during this period, and in fact, it was a 'moral panic' against 'prison lesbianism' that almost led to her dismissal as a superintendent in 1949. At this time, her successful female networks were to prove indispensable in prompting widespread protest from Episcopal, Jewish and Catholic clergy, the Massachusetts State Federation of Women's Clubs, Massachusetts Council of Churches, National Council of Jewish Women and Americans for Democratic Action.
However, Van Waters herself eluded 'outing' although she sacrificed mementos of her past, such as two decades-worth of romantic letters from her lifelong companion, Geraldine Thompson (1872–1967). Given strong public support, she weathered this storm. It was to be another eight years before she entered well-earned retirement after her life of public service.
Life in Retirement: 1957-1974.
After her retirement, Van Waters moved into an apartment with two former inmates and staff members from the Massachusetts Reformatory. According to her biographer, Estelle Freedman, she did not slow down in retirement, and tirelessly still campaigned for greater prison reform, civil rights, and abolition of the death penalty, which she abhorred. She respected Martin Luther King, but muscular dystrophy and a hip fracture meant that she was unable to personally participate in the cause of civil rights as much as she, a lifelong anti-racist, would have liked. This did not prevent her from participation in the Community of the Holy Spirit, a reform-minded Episcopal women's social service ministry, during the sixties.
As time went on, however, her friends began to pass away. Van Waters and Geraldine Thompson remained lovers, and participated in joint social activities like membership of the Audubon Society. Sadly, Thompson predeceased her, and died in 1967. In 1972, Van Waters experienced a minor stroke, but her remaining friends and associates were concerned at what it might mean. In January 1974, Miriam Van Waters died. Although Estelle Freedman relates that her former onsite superintendent’s house is still there, it has not fared well in a harsher and more punitive penal environment.

National Theatre in Belgrade

The National Theatre ( / "") was founded in the latter half of the 19th century. It is located on Republic Square, in Belgrade, Serbia.
The National Theatre was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1983, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.
History.
In 1868, the Serbian National Theatre from Novi Sad (then the capital of Serbian culture in Austria-Hungary) performed in Belgrade (then the capital of the Principality of Serbia). Prince Michael, impressed by the performances he experienced, invited Jovan Đorđević (the founder of the Novi Sad Serbian National Theatre) to found a similar institution in Serbia. Having accepted, Jovan Đorđević came to Belgrade with half of his company of actors and founded the National Theatre in Belgrade, seven years after having founded the Novi Sad theatre.
The National Theatre building.
The National Theatre Belgrade was built in 1869 according to the design of Aleksandar Bugarski, the most productive architect of Belgrade in the 19th century. The decision to construct a special building for the theatre was made by Knez Mihailo Obrenović. The building was a typical theatre building at the time and was particularly reminiscent of La Scala, Milan, with regard to its Renaissance conception and the decorative finish. Later, reconstructions completely changed the original appearance. The heavy reconstruction was made in 1986 when the theatre regained the 1922 look and an annex was built towards Braće Jugovića Street. Beside theatrical purposes, the hall has been used for charity balls and concerts during the 19th century. The Great Constitutional Assembly adopted the famous 1888 Constitution in this building.
Performance facilities.
The National Theatre Belgrade has 2 halls for performing arts.
The Grand Hall has 3 levels. The ground level has 219 seats in total with the seats at the front being most expensive. There are 3 balconies in the theatre with the first one being the most expensive.
Large operas, dramas and ballets are presented at the Grand Hall.
Raša Plaović has 281 seats and with no balconies. It is much smaller and less beautiful then the Grand Hall. Smaller scale dramas are played out on this stage.
The events of 1999.
During one of the toughest times in Serbian history, which is the 1999 NATO bombing, this theatre was the only one to open its doors to the public during the 78-day air raids. For only 1 dinar, opera, plays and ballets were performed to the public. The performance times were very unusual, from 15:00 to 18:00. It was done because in that period of time there were not NATO air strikes on Belgrade. World well-known opera conductor, maestro Alberto Zedda, said once that during those horrible days Belgrade Opera was proudly writing the most dignified pages of history of world opera.
Drama, opera, ballet.
Drama.
The activity of Drama of the National Theatre can be viewed as a development in four stages: from 1868 till 1914, from 1918 till 1941, from 1945 until 1991, and from 1991 till today. The first stage is marked by many tragedies and enactments inspired by medieval and modern history, like The Death of Uroš V by Stefan Stefanović. The characteristic of the repertoire of the National Theatre, especially at the end of the 19th century were plays with singing like dramatizations of Stevan Sremac’s popular short stories: Zona Zamfirova and Ivkova Slava.
In the first two decades of the 20th century the broadening of subject matters was noticeable. Beside Branislav Nušić others like Simo Matavulj, Vojislav Jovanović Marambo, Mirabo and Milivoj Predić must be mentioned. Koštana by Borisav Stanković was first shown at the very beginning of the 20th century and it has remained the cult performance of this theatre till this day. In the first stage on the repertoire of the National Theatre were plays written by the most significant writers of all periods: from the earliest (Sophocles), to Shakespeare, Calderon, Molière, Racine, Goldoni, Rostand, Gete, Ibsen, Strindberg, Gogol, Ostrovsky, Chekhov and Gorky.
Between the two world wars, speaking of domestic dramaturgy, the plays of Jovan Sterija Popović, Branislav Nušić, Milutin Bojić, Borisav Stanković, Ivo Vojnović, Milan Begović, Ivan Cankar and Todor Manojlović were staged.
In the period from 1945 till 1953 the plays with clear political message were played. Political changes and certain liberalization characterise the relationship towards the foreign dramaturgy and discovering of the American drama and the works of Jonesco and Becket.
The seventies and eighties were marked by plays of Borislav Mihajlović Mihiz, Aleksandar Popović, Žarko Komanin, Ljubomir Simović and Jovan Hristić. The National Theatre opened its door to the contemporary world dramaturgy. Plays by Martin Mcdona, Erich Emanuel Schmidt, Nina Valsa, Jasmina Reza, Pavel Kohout are played and plays by Serbian contemporary writers Siniša Kovačević, Vida Ognjenović, Jelena Kajgo, Miloš Nikolić, Stevan Pešić can be seen on the stage of the National Theatre.
Opera.
The music ensemble of the National Theatre in Belgrade worked towards being a professional opera ensemble from 1882.
As an independent ensemble, the Opera of the National Theatre began its work in 1919. On 11 February 1919, under the leadership of the first music director of the Opera Sector of the National Theatre, Stanislav Binički, a conductor, the opera "Madam Butterfly" by Giacomo Puccini, was performed. The first opera performances were received very favourably, most of them were operas by Italian composers (Rossini, Verdi), while Serbian music was represented by the works of Stevan Hristić ("The sunset"), and Petar Konjović ("Prince of Zeta").
In the ten years 1924 to 1933 Stevan Hristić was the director of the Belgrade Opera. This period marked an expansion of the repertoire and the first tour abroad. Conductors such as Lovro Matačić, Ivan Brezovšek, directors Branko Gavela and Josip Kulundžić were notable in the period between the two wars. Russian singers prevailed in the ensemble, but there were also Serbian singers such as Bahrija Nuri-Hadžić, Zdenka Zikova, Melanija Bugarinović and Nikola Cvejić.
After the Second World War, conductor Oskar Danon quickly renewed the activities of the Opera as its general manager. Special attention was dedicated to the domestic opera composers.
The golden period of the Belgrade Opera saw significant development and international affirmation of the Serbian operatic art. Starting in 1954 with a very successful performance of "Boris Godunov" by Modest Mussorgsky in Switzerland as a part of a concert cycle 'Clubhouse', and gramophone recordings of seven major Russian operas for Decca. The Decca series was supported by Gerald Severn, an émigré white Russian. The venue found in the then Yugoslav capital for the first batch of recordings was the cinema in the Dome of Culture (House of culture) complex, but which could only be used after the last film of the day (around 11pm) so sessions took place at night. "Prince Igor" and "Khovanschina" were recorded in February 1955, with "Eugene Onegin", "Life for the Tsar", "Snow Maiden" and "Queen of Spades" in September and October that year, all among the early Decca stereo records. The company's recording of "Boris Godunov" took place in Zagreb between the other sets of sessions.
The culmination of this 'golden period' was an outstanding production of "Mazeppa" by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky on the stage of the Theater das Westerns in West Berlin. The most eminent foreign critics pointed out the wholeness of the performance, good teamwork and the beauty of the performing, outstanding soloist creations, acoustic superiority, the homogeneity of the choir and the professional playing of the orchestra of the National Theatre from Belgrade. The opera has attracted talented musicians, including Sándor Szabó and others.
Ballet.
Ballet has always been a great part of the National Theatre Belgrade. One of its most important and most watched ballet performances is the Swan Lake. Ballet of the National Theatre is very well known by its world premieres. One of the titles national Ballet is proud the most is Anna Karenina by Russian composer Schedrin, as well as The Legend from Ohrid by Serbian composer S. Hristic.

Société de géographie

The Société de Géographie (French, "Geographical Society"), is the world's oldest geographical society. It was founded in 1821 (the first of all). Since 1878, its headquarters has been at 184 Boulevard Saint-Germain, Paris. The entrance is marked by two gigantic caryatids representing "Land" and "Sea". It was here, in 1879, that the construction of the Panama Canal was decided.
History.
The Geographical Society was founded at a meeting, 15 December 1821, in the Paris Hôtel de Ville and among its 217 founders were some of the greatest scientific names of the time: Pierre-Simon Laplace, the Society's first president; Georges Cuvier, Charles Pierre Chapsal, Vivant Denon, Joseph Fourier, Gay-Lussac, Claude Louis Berthollet, Alexander von Humboldt, Champollion, François-René de Chateaubriand among them. Most of those men who had accompanied Bonaparte in his Egyptian expedition were members: Edme-François Jomard, Conrad Malte-Brun, Jules Dumont d'Urville, Jules Paul Benjamin Delessert, Hottinguer, Henri Didot, Bottin and others such as Jean-Baptiste Benoît Eyriès.
The Society was the location of the Arab Congress of 1913, which took place from June 18 to June 23 of that year and marked the confluence of events surrounding the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the beginnings of Arab nationalism, and early Arab reaction to Zionist immigration to Palestine.
Publications.
The Society's revue has appeared monthly since 1822, as "Bulletin de la Société de Géographie" (1822-1899)—offering in octavo format early news of all the discoveries of the nineteenth century—or quarterly, as "La Géographie", with a break in 1940-46. Since 1947 the Society's magazine has appeared three times a year, as "Acta Geographica". The Society's library, map collection and photograph collection are among the world's most comprehensive and deepest.

Brewers' Distributor

Brewers' Distributor Ltd. or BDL is a Canadian company that distributes beer throughout the four western provinces and three northern territories. It is a private joint venture company owned by InBev (parent company of Labatt Breweries) and Molson-Coors (parent company of Molson Breweries following the Molson-Coors merger).
History.
The company was established in 1995 when Pacific Brewers Distributor in British Columbia, Alberta Brewers Agents, Saskatchewan Brewers Association and Associated Beer Distributors in Manitoba (all of which were owned, or largely, owned by the two present shareholders) were consolidated into a single operation. BDL operates nine distribution centres and four cross dock facilities in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The head office is located in Calgary.
Difference between Brewers Retail Inc..
There are a few key differences between BDL and Brewers Retail Inc. which operates under largely the same ownership in the neighboring province of Ontario. First, BDL does not retail beer to consumers, it is only in the warehousing and distribution business. Second, although BDL distributes the vast majority of beer sold in Western Canada, it has not been granted monopolistic privileges by any provincial government. Other domestic breweries are free to distribute their own beer if they wish – some non-shareholders (such as the Big Rock and Sleeman Breweries) have their own distribution chains although others voluntarily use BDL. Third, BDL has been permitted to distribute some brands of imported beer since 2001 except in Alberta where the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission had already contracted out its entire distribution operation to a private company and continues to grant Connect Logistics Inc. the exclusive right to distribute imported beer to Alberta's privately owned establishments and stores. BRI stocks imported beer in its The Beer Store locations but this beer is purchased through the Liquor Control Board of Ontario.
Clarification.
BDL does not distribute wine or distilled spirits in any province. These are distributed in Alberta by the AGLC through its private contractor, and in the other western provinces and territories by their respective government-owned liquor corporations.

Geoff (Greyhawk)

Geoff is a fictional land that is part of the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game. Geoff was first described in 1983 in the "World of Greyhawk" campaign setting, where Geoff is properly known as the Grand Duchy of Geoff, and is a ducal political state of the fictional continent called the Flanaess.
Besides being in literature and serving as a potential land of adventure for players of the Dungeons and Dragons campaign, the Grand Duchy of Geoff was selected by The RPGA and Wizards of the Coast as a region for its Living Greyhawk campaign (2000–2008). As a result, thousands of role-players enjoyed adventures and other gaming events held in Geoff.
History.
As described in the original "World of Greyhawk Fantasy World Setting" setting, the Duchy of Geoff was at peace and safe from the ravages of war that threatened the continent. Later published boxed sets and supplements such as "From the Ashes", "Greyhawk Wars", "", and the "Living Greyhawk Gazetteer" described how the region was transformed in Common Year (CY) 583 / Flan Tracking (FT) 2463 as armies of giants from the Crystalmist Mountains mounted a brutal invasion. Much of the Duchy was destroyed or enslaved.
Geography and climate.
Geoff is situated in the western Sheldomar Valley region of the Flanaess. The nation is bordered by the Crystalmists to the west, the Barrier Peaks to the north, the Stark Mounds to the south, and the Javan River to the east. Its closest neighbors are the Valley of the Mage to the north, Gran March to the east, and Sterich to the south. Geoff encompasses the entire Hornwood, most of the Oytwood, and the western portion of the Dim Forest.
Due to its isolated position, Geoff experiences some unusual weather. Morning fog is quite common near the Dim Forest, contributing to northeastern Geoff's reputation for secrecy and hauntings. Rain is plentiful, with short, violent thunderstorms. Geoff experiences significant snowfall in winter, especially in the mountains and western regions.
People.
The human folk of Geoff show strong Flan racial characteristics, tempered by Suel and Oeridian influences. Sylvan elves inhabit the Oytwood, Dim, and Hornwood forests, and dwarves dwell in the Crystalmist and Barrier Peaks mountain ranges. Gnomes are present in the hilly regions south of Gorna. Halflings are also found in Geoff.
Population.
As of 591 CY, the population of Geoff was numbered at 90,000 persons, the vast majority being humans. Elves, halflings, dwarves, and gnomes make up less than 20% of the total population. The land also includes vast numbers of uncounted orcs, goblins, giants, and other fell creatures.
Religion.
The most popular deities in Geoff are those of the Old Faith: Pelor, Allitur, Obad-Hai, and Beory. Other popular deities include Ehlonna, Phyton, Fharlanghn, Saint Cuthbert, and Norebo. The Seldarine and gnomish pantheon also have strong followings.
Languages.
The most widely-spoken languages in Geoff include Common, Flan, Keolandish, Elvish, Halfling, Orcish, Goblin, and Giant.
In the "Living Greyhawk" campaign, the Flan language of Geoff is based on Welsh. The country is called "Gyruff" in Flan and its people are the "Gyri."
Government.
The Duchy of Geoff is a feudal monarchy allied with other nations of the Sheldomar Valley and swearing fealty to the Keoish crown. The national capital is Gorna.
Administrative divisions.
Prior to 584 CY, the Grand Duchy of Geoff consisted of six high counties, numerous
elven lordships among nomadic woodland tribes, and a few dwarf and gnome lordships in the Stark Mounds. Currently, there are several ill-managed "provinces" commanded by the most powerful giants inhabiting former human cities.
Executive branch.
Geoff's chief of state is the Grand Duke, also known as the "Brenin." The Grand Duke rules for life. The current Grand Duke is Owen I, who has been living in exile in Shiboleth, Gran March since 584 CY, due to the nation being overrun by giants during the Greyhawk Wars. Grand Duke Owen returned to Geoff in CY 591 to begin the effort to drive the giants from Geoff.
Legislative branch.
The distribution of legislative authority is not detailed in sourcebooks. It is likely, based upon the "six high counties" mentioned in the "Living Greyhawk Gazeteer", as well as the town descriptions in "Against the Giants, The Liberation of Geoff", that there was some provincial and town legislative authority.
In the "Living Greyhawk campaign", each Cantrev is ruled by a Llwyr (baron) or Arglwythi (baron for smaller cantrevi). These Llwyri, along with the Peers of Geoff (adventurers and other worthies named by the Duke) and other selected officials (High Mage, Ex-Chequer, etc.), form the High Court. The High Court provides legislative support for the Duke. The Old Faith Druids are somewhat separate from the rest of the Duchy, having some autonomy and at the same time influencing both executive and legislative decisions for the Duchy. The Dwarven, Elven, and Gnomish nations are autonomous and not bound by laws made by the High Court.
Heraldry.
Geoff's coat of arms is blazoned thus: "Per pale sable and argent a griffin rampant counterchanged". The coat of arms is illustrated at the top of this page.
Economy.
Resources.
Prior to 584 CY, Geoff's most valuable resources were fur, wool, copper, silver, gold, timber, and gemstones.
Currency.
Geoff's standard coinage consists of the platinum griffon (pp), gold lion (gp), electrum eagle (ep), silver hawk (sp), and copper owl (cp).
Transportation.
Since the giant incursions, Geoff's roads are in disrepair. Traveling upon them is relatively safe, however, as giants tend to ignore roads to take the most direct overland path.
Military.
Prior to 584 CY, Geoff's military consisted of archers (mostly sylvan elves and half-elves), cavalry and pikemen. Very little evidence of an organized Geoffite army currently exists. Survivors of the giant invasion mounted limited guerilla warfare or fled to Gran March or Sterich, and from there encourage the retaking of Geoff. As of 588 CY, many Knights of the Watch and Dispatch are based in the town of Hochoch, mounting small raids.
Geoff in the Living Greyhawk RPGA campaign.
The Grand Duchy of Geoff is also a playable region in the Living Greyhawk game. Players who join the RPGA can create characters (PCs) from Geoff and advance in level as they explore the region through adventures ordered from the RPGA for home play or at gaming conventions.
The Geoff region has been consistently ranked in online polls as one of the favorite Living Greyhawk regions amongst players.
Cantrevi.
There are currently thirteen cantrevi in the Duchy. This includes the gain of three new cantrevi gifted by Keoland in late CY594, as well as the loss of Arweth to the Gran March and Knights of the Watch in CY594.
Each cantrev is ruled by a Gyri warlord. Smaller cantrevi are ruled by Arglwyths, while larger ones are ruled by Llwyri (singular is Llwyr, sing. fem. is Llwyress). Llwyri are the highest level of nobility in Geoff, with Argglwyths being the second highest. However, there are no Arglwyths under a Llwyr - each Arglwyth has their own cantrev. Each cantreval leader serves the Brenin, who leads all of Geoff.
To compare the Gyric nobility system to (generally) the English nobility system (which is similar to the system used in most of the Sheldomar valley), Llwyr and Arglwyths are Earls, or powerful
military leaders. Arglwyths might be considered Viscounts, perhaps. Swearing fealty to Llwyrs and Arglwyths are Brehirs, or Barons.
Noble ranks are generally inherited. However, all Llwyri and Arglwyths have to be approved by the Old Faith Druids. The approval by the Old Faith in large part rests on successfully undergoing a special ritual - success indicates that the Land of Geoff approves of their claim.
Cantrevi vary in size, geography, and resources.
Traditionally, the rulers of the Cantrevi (plural of Cantrev) were the leaders of large tribes or clans of Gyri. Over time, the tribes settled and began farming. Eventually, tribes or clans started claiming specific areas of land which became the first Cantrevi.
At various times in the history of the Duchy, the leaders of the cantrevi have engaged in warfare to settle disputes. A Llwyr or Arglwyth may be overthrown by force, but must ultimately gain the support of the Old Faith to retain the title and any lands acquired. Warmongering is not necessarily a negative quality for a Llwyr or Arglwyth, though the requirement for Druidic approval tends to keep such tendencies in check.
Llwyri and Arglwythi have on several occasions claimed the throne (usually when a Brenin is absent or has died). This has led to civil war between cantrevi. Any ultimate victor must of course be approved by the Old Faith and the Land.
The Llwyr of Eynyth has thus far always been the Brenin. The position of Brenin came about because the Llwyri and Arglwyth ceded power to him so that there could be one warlord for all the Gyri. Traditionally, the Llwyri and Arglwyths have had little interference from the Brenin in how they run their cantrevi. In a certain sense, they consider themselves sovereign kings in their own right.
This attitude has changed slowly over the years CY591-596, with the Brenin gaining more and more power. Events in the last few years have also changed things. With the vanquishing of the giants, Grand Duke Owen is more popular than ever. With many Llwyri and Arglwyths killed in the fighting, Owen has appointed his supporters to fill the vacant positions.
Dwarven Nations.
The Dwur (Dwarves) of Gyruff are organized into three Clan Holds. Clan Deepholm, made up of mountain dwarves, is just West of the cantrev of Ystrad Cloer and is home to the Three-Hold Thane that rules over all dwarves. Deepholm is known for its ale and its military might. Clan Stonereaver's hold is in the Barrier Peaks and the clan is known for their magical capability. Stonereaver's are mountain dwarves. Clan Underhill is composed of hill dwarves and resides in the low hills or Urtcheck. Clan Underhill is known for their mining skill.
Elven Nations.
The Dim forest is largely overtaken by the forces of the Shadow Dragon, though many elven towns remain in elven hands (predominantly Wood Elves). The Oytwood is home to the Grey Elves and the Weeping Council which guides them. The High Elves reside in the Hornwood, recently reclaimed from the giants and led by a new High King.
Gnome Nation.
The Stark Mounds is in the southern area of Geoff and creates the border between Geoff and Sterich. In these rolling lands live the Noniz (Gnomes). There are 13 clans of Gnomes led by a king, who rules from Moundgnomery. They are constantly targeted by goblinoid units under giant control due to several pivotal contributions the gnomes have provided to the Gyri in the war against the giants. The giants hope these goblinoid units will prevent further gnomish interference.
Meta-Organizations.
The Living Geoff campaign has a number of meta-organizations to which player characters can belong. These provide additional detail to the setting.
Military Organizations.
Historically, the military of Geoff was divided up into cantreval units. These could come together during times of war. This did not work well during the initial giant attack, slowing response time and contributing to the ease with which the giants gained control of the Duchy. During the war against the giants an Army of Liberation was created and cantreval units were disbanded. With the victory over the giants in CY595, the Army of Liberation was disbanded and cantrevi could once again maintain armies. In addition, a central force called the Brenin's Fist was created to provide a more rapid response for Duchy-wide defense.
In addition to the cantreval militias and the Brenin's Fist, two other organizations provide military might. The Longbowmen of Geoff are an independent organization that attracts the finest Gyri archers. The Olwythi are rangers, monitoring the wilderness and serving the Gyir as well as the land. Both were formidable opposition to the giants.
Events of the First Five Years (2471-2476 FT).
The Geoff Living Greyhawk campaign began in 2001 (591 CY or 2471 FT - Flan Tracking), placing would-be heroes in Hochoch, the only free town in all of Geoff. Players enjoyed a compelling five-year story arc allowing them to play a part in freeing Geoff from the giant armies. Triads and volunteers created a wealth of background information, a multitude of organizations their characters could join and help shape, and engaging and challenging modules and interactives.
In December 2006 (596 CY / 2476 FT) the players and their characters succeeded in freeing Geoff from the giants through a combination of module and interactive events that defeated both the giant armies and their mysterious Sakhut leaders. Geoff was one of a few regions to allow retiring characters the option of becoming part of the setting.
Cross-Regional Machinations.
Triads in the Geoff and Gran March regions created tension between the two regions as the Gran March was shown to have designs upon the town of Hochoch, adding a vivid cultural and political dimension to the gaming environment. Through a nefarious deal, the town of Hochoch ceased to be controlled by Geoff and was given by the Gran March to the Knights of the Watch. This resulted in the town ceasing to be part of the playable region, becoming the seat of power for the Knights of the Watch, and creating further enmity between player characters in the two regions.
Online Events.
Online play was a halmark of the Geoff region. Players used the Living Geoff Yahoo group to post player character stories. Soon the player characters began to interact with one another. The Triad blessed this interaction, bringing NPCs to the forum and making the events official. After volatile events, the Triad created the Geoff Online Yahoo group solely for the purpose of online in character interactions.
Notable incidents that changed the region include:
Teasers.
The Geoff region became known for releasing teasers (often prior to a convention) that communicated recent events to players, added background to the setting and its NPCs, and created interest for conventions and module premiers. The quality of the teasers was due to many authors and proofreaders, but was in no small part due to the overall storyline vision of Triad members Sholom West and Eric Menge. Sholom West was the driving force behind many of the early storylines and a great deal of the background, while Eric Menge was instrumental in establishing teasers and metagame information.
Convention Interactives.
The Geoff Region enjoyed a wide variety of role-playing and battle interactive (BI) events beginning in July 2001 with the Battle of the Bloody Ridge. The interactives helped to attract players from other regions to conventions and to spread Geoff's reputation across the LG player base. Area gaming groups such as Plan B, Gryphon's Wrath, The Regulators, and Boomkegs volunteered to create interactives.
Events of the Second Five Years (2477-2482 FT).
In January 2007 (CY597 / 2477FT) the second story arc began, slowly revealing a renewed threat from the Shadow Dragon in the Dim forest. Various important women (The Daughters of Geoff) have shown to be central to emerging events. Finally, the gnomish kingdom seems to be facing threats from within and may destabilize the region.
List of RPGA Living Greyhawk Geoff Modules.
"Year 1 modules added the player character levels together to determine the difficulty (Tiering system). Year 2 and later modules used an average of the character levels (also known as APL - Average Party Level) to determine the difficulty."
"Code IS : Introductory Modules for first level characters only"
Triads.
While a comprehensive list of all volunteers that have made the Geoff region such a success is not possible, the Triad members that have made this possible and who lead all the efforts can be recognized:

<doc id="5900075" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5900075" title="Hilton of Cadboll Stone">
Hilton of Cadboll Stone

The Hilton of Cadboll Stone is a Class II Pictish stone discovered at Hilton of Cadboll, on the East coast of the Tarbat Peninsula in Easter Ross, Scotland. It is one of the most magnificent of all Pictish cross-slabs. On the seaward-facing side is a Christian cross, and on the landward facing side are secular depictions. The latter are carved below the Pictish symbols of crescent and v-rod and double disc and Z-rod: a hunting scene including a woman wearing a large penannular brooch riding side-saddle. Like other similar stones, it can be dated to about 800 AD.
The stone was formerly on in the vicinity of a chapel just north of the village. It was removed to Invergordon Castle in the 19th century, before being donated to the British Museum. The latter move was not popular with the Scottish public, and so it was moved once more, to the Museum of Scotland, where it remains today. A replica designed and carved by Barry Grove was recently erected on the site.
In 2001 the missing lower portion of the cross-slab, along with several thousand carved fragments, was recovered by Glasgow University Archaeological Research Division (GUARD) during an excavation funded by Historic Scotland. Following some controversy around where this section of the monument should be curated it was finally put on display Hilton of Cadboll village hall rather than joining the upper portion at the Museum of Scotland. In parallel with the excavation, Historic Scotland also funded research carried out by Professor Sian Jones of the University of Manchester into the significance of Early Medieval Sculpture to local communities which concentrated on the historical fragmentation and movement of the Hilton of Cadboll monument as well its modern role in the production of meaning, value and place The excavation and subsequent analysis of the 'biography' of the monument was the foundation of a major monograph published by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 2008. The digital elements of the excavation archive were deposited with the Archaeology Data Service.
The goals of the 2001 GUARD excavation was meant to recover the remaining fragments of the carved stone and to provide context to the stone, and establish where and when it was erected. A topographic survey was carried out to produce a geographic information system (GIS). This data was used to plan a 100 square metre trench centred around the stone stump and extending to one metre beyond the furthest carved fragment previously recovered. The final trench dug measured 88.5 square metres.
The GUARD excavation of the stump and carving fragments revealed that the cross held at least two previous settings. The east side of the stump matched the stone and was broken on both ends showing that there are still several pieces missing. Unlike the Hilton stone, only one side of stump had been carved which, in addition to the 1,134 carved fragments, showed that one of the faces of the Hilton of Cadboll Stone was re-carved. The broken stump was carefully removed from the site for conservation.
The presence of 6 skeletons in burials shows that the stone was likely re-carved to mark the cemetery. Only one skeleton was fully excavated and removed after documenting and photographing the burial "in situ", the others were remained undisturbed throughout the excavation. Additionally, several metatarsals were removed for radiocarbon dating and were returned to the site once testing was complete. These burials contained various types of pottery and some stones with an unknown glaze on the surface.
Ten soil samples were taken from the site which appeared to contain charcoal or other evidence about the environment. These samples were subjected to optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating coupled with the analysis of the stratigraphy in order to establish the age and content of the soil. Five distinct levels were discovered in the soil which date from 9th century to present day. The laboratory tests revealed the true age of the stone.

Ye Wanyong

Ye Wanyong (; 17 July 1858, Seongnam – 12 February 1926), also known as Yi Wan-yong was a pro-Japanese minister of Korea, who signed the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty, which placed Korea under Japanese rule in 1910.
Born to a prominent family in Gyeonggi-do province, Ye spent three years in the United States from 1887–1891. Ye was a founding member of the Independence Club established in 1896 and belonged to the ‘reform faction’ which wanted to westernize Korea and to open the country to foreign trade. Ye was a prominent government minister at the time of Eulsa Treaty of 1905, and was the most outspoken supporter of the pact which made the Korean Empire a protectorate of the Empire of Japan, thus stripping it of its diplomatic sovereignty. The treaty was signed in defiance of Korean Emperor Gojong, and he is thus accounted to be the chief of five ministers (including Park Jae-soon, Lee Ji-yong, Lee Geun-taek, Gwon Joong-hyun) who were later denounced as Five Eulsa Traitors in Korea. 
Under Japanese Resident-General Itō Hirobumi, Ye was promoted to the post of prime minister from 1906-1910. Ye was instrumental in forcing Emperor Gojong to abdicate in 1907, after Emperor Gojong tried to publicly denounce the Eulsa Treaty at the second international Hague Peace Convention.
In 1910, Ye signed the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty by which Japan took full control over Korea, while Korean Emperor Sunjong refused to sign. For his cooperation with the Japanese, Ye was rewarded with a peerage in the Japanese "kazoku" system, becoming a "hakushaku" (Count), in 1910, which was raised to the title of "kōshaku" (Marquis) in 1921. He died in 1926.
After the independence of Korea at the end of World War II, the grave of Ye was dug up and his remains suffered the posthumous dismemberment, which is often considered to be the most disgraceful punishment in Confucian ideology. Ye Wanyong's name has almost become synonymous to that of ‘traitor’ in modern Korea.
However, Seo Jae-pil's Dongnip Sinmun (Independence Newspaper) never wrote a single line of criticism against him.
He mistakenly thought that the annexation would make a Korea-Japan dual monarchy, similar to Austria-Hungary or Sweden-Norway. 
The "Special law to redeem pro-Japanese collaborators' property" was enacted in 2005 and the committee confiscated the property of the descendants of nine people that had collaborated with Japan when Korea was annexed by Japan in August 1910. Ye is one of those heading the list.

Stanleyville, North Carolina

Stanleyville is an unincorporated community between northern Winston-Salem and Rural Hall in Forsyth County, North Carolina. Most of the community has been annexed by Winston-Salem. Stanleyville is located along North Carolina Highway 66 near the future Interstate 74 interchange with U.S. Highway 52. It is home to many farms and recently has seen a surge in commercial expansion. It does not have a post office, so all mail is routed through adjoining Rural Hall. Stanleyville Drive is the main road through Stanleyville. It was originally a dirt road, later paved as homes began to be built in the area. Some of the farm homes are over 50 years old, but most homes were built in the last 25 years.

A Passage in Time (Dead Can Dance album)

A Passage in Time is a compilation album by Australian musical act Dead Can Dance. It was originally released only in North America on 21 October 1991 by Rykodisc Records, and was later remastered and given a global release in 1998. 
The album was titled after the song "A Passage in Time", which originally appeared on the group's eponymous debut album in 1984 but was not included in the collection.
Overview.
As the title suggests, this album was "a passage in time" to enable the U.S. audience catch up with the band's previous albums, via selected songs.
The content of the compilation was predominantly taken from the band's most recent works at the time, their fourth ("The Serpent's Egg") and fifth ("Aion") albums. It also featured two songs from their third album ("Within the Realm of a Dying Sun") and one from their second ("Spleen and Ideal"), but no selections from their debut or the "Garden of the Arcane Delights" EP. Two previously unreleased tracks were included, "Bird" and "Spirit" (both were later added to the double vinyl version of 1993's "Into the Labyrinth").

Bernard Odum (1932 – August 17, 2004) was an US bass guitar player best known for performing in James Brown's band in the 1960s.
Odum started playing with Brown in 1956 and became a full-time member of Brown's band in 1958. He worked in the James Brown band until the end of the 1960s, and played on such hits as "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" (1965), "I Got You (I Feel Good)" (1965), "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" (1966), and "Cold Sweat" (1967).
In 1969, Odum and most of the other musicians in Brown's band walked out on him over a pay dispute and other issues, prompting Brown to create a new backing band, The J.B.'s. In 1970, Odum briefly joined Maceo Parker's group, Maceo & All the King's Men, appearing on the album "Doin' Their Own Thing".
Bernard Odum played a 1956 Fender Precision Bass, strung with flatwound strings, throughout most of his career. He also played a Vox "teardrop" bass as well as a 120 watt Westminster 1x18 bass combo amp when Brown and his band gained an endorsement from Vox towards the end of 1965.
Odum died of kidney failure at the age of 72 in his hometown of Mobile, Alabama.

Ruby (band)

Ruby is the collaboration of singer Lesley Rankine and Mark Walk. Rankine relocated from London to Seattle to collaborate with the producer in 1994. Their music styles expanded across the genres of electronic, trip hop, noise, industrial, and jazz, among others. Between 1995 and 2013, the band has released two studio albums, three remix albums and various singles and EPs. The name for this group came about because Rankine and Walk both have maternal grandmothers named "Ruby".
"Ruby" members.
Lesley Rankine.
Rankine (born April 11, 1965) began her music career as front woman to London garage psych band The Grizzelders, recording one Cassette only release called "Making It Real Gear", before forming noise band Silverfish, leaving the group after the release of their 1993 LP "Organ Fan" and then departing for Seattle. There she joined forces with producer Mark Walk to create an electronic album which echoed the downtempo styles, especially trip hop, more than their noise backgrounds. She had previously worked with Walk on material for industrial group Pigface. The result was the album "Salt Peter", which was released in 1995, with a remix album, "Revenge, The Sweetest Fruit", appearing in 1996. She also appeared on the Toronto-based Monster Voodoo Machine's "Suffersystem" album recorded in 1994 at Chicago Trax; this album would win a Juno Award. Following the release of "Ruby's" debut album and the supporting tour that ended in 1996, Rankine with Tom Jones recorded a cover of the song Kung Fu Fighting, and later recorded a one-minute version of Lerner and Loewe's "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" for a Samuel Bayer-directed Mountain Dew commercial in which she also appeared.
Rankine then moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. The stay would be only six months due to events including a rash of car-jackings and hold-ups in the surrounding areas, and culminating with the murder of a woman in the garden across from her. When Rankine learned the killer had deposited the victim's clothing in her garbage as they left the scene, she left New Orleans within five days for Seattle to start recording "Ruby's" second album with producer Mark Walk.
Most of "Short-Staffed at the Gene Pool" would be finished by August 1998 and nearly completed by Rankine in her native Scotland throughout 1999. Rankine would spend the year 2000 dealing with the old contracts with labels WORK and Creation, and setting things up with Wichita in the UK, with the band's next two albums out in 2001. For a short time "Ruby" continued to collaborate with former Creation label members Mark Bowen and Dick Green, but by March 2008 no further recordings had been released. Rankine took a break from recording, returning to her home country.
In December 2012, Rankine announced on her Facebook page that she was working on new music and videos under the "Ruby" name. In 2013, she subsequently released the "Revert To Type" EP and "Type 2.0" remix EP, together with singles and music videos. 
Mark Walk.
Walk had previously worked with Rankine on material for industrial group Pigface. As of March 2008, he resided in Los Angeles, USA, where in addition to collaborating on albums for both of the groups Skinny Puppy and ohGr, he has been writing and producing music for commercials as well as film.
Albums.
"Salt Peter".
Ruby's first album, "Salt Peter", was released November 1, 1995. The album would produce three singles, all of which would chart in the UK. It was made almost entirely using computers and without a band. The album's songs have been described as being driven by loops of drums and repetitious guitar/bass riffs. Rankine explains the approach and reasoning:
"Salt Peter's" first single was "Paraffin", released on November 7, 1995. The compilation "New Voices vol. 3" from Rolling Stone Magazine had this song as its second track. It was followed up with "Ruby's" best known song, "Tiny Meat", which was also released in 1995. It would be the only song by the band to chart in the United States, reaching #22 on the Modern Rock Tracks list. This song was also included in the compilation "MTV Fresh 2." Another single, "Hoops" came out in early 1996. Later in that year the promotion-only single for the track "Swallow Baby" was put out for radio play. An up-to-then unreleased song called "This Is" was on the soundtrack to the film "The Cable Guy" in May 1996. The CD single for the song "Paraffin" included a remix called "Harpie Mix" which was also on the soundtrack to the 1997 movie "The Beautician and the Beast." All of "Salt Peter's" singles had music videos made for them.
In his review of "Salt Peter", Troy Carpenter, co-director of nudeasthenews.com, considered the album promising but not ground-breaking musically, however "surprisingly original". Its music he considered "often less-than-stellar" but the lyrics were what caught his attention, and he sums the effort up by stating "Though "Salt Peter" leaves the aural palate dissatisfied, it brushes with greatness.
On April 8, 1996, a remix album called "Revenge, The Sweetest Fruit: Salt Peter Remixed" was released in the United States, followed by the UK version "Stroking The Full Length" on October 29, 1996. The third track from "Stroking..." is a "Ceasefire Remix" of the song "Flippin' tha Bird" and this version was part of the movie soundtrack to the 1997 film "Nowhere." The Japan release of "Stroking..." was out on September 1, 1996, and came with an extra track the other remix albums of "Salt Peter" do not have. It was the "Mark Walk Mix" of the song "Tiny Meat."
"Short-Staffed At The Gene Pool".
During and after the tour in support of "Salt Peter," the duo began early work on their next album; however several events would push its release well into 2001. Among these issues the largest were internal problems in the studio and the struggle then eventual folding of "Ruby's" label Creation Records in 1999, when the band (as with most of Creation's artists) was meshed into the parent label, Sony. Rankine described the situation and time frame in an interview from August 8, 2001, by Holly Day:
The album "Short-Staffed At The Gene Pool" would be the result, released on April 23, 2001, in the UK, and a day later in the US. It was on new labels for the group, Wichita Recordings and 
Thirsty Ear Recordings. The album produced three singles; "Grace" (released March 20, 2001), "Beefheart" (July 31, 2001), and "Lamplight" (released in 2002), all of which had music videos made for them. "Ruby's" last album to date (as of March 2008) was "Altered and Proud, the Short Staffed Remixes," which came out on July 17, 2001. Neither the studio album "Short staffed...", the remix album "Altered and Proud...", or any of their singles would chart in the United States.
"Revert To Type".
On 1 February 2013, Rankine released a new single and music video, "Waiting For Light".
This was followed by a 6 track EP, "Revert To Type" on 23 July 2013, which was produced by Scott Firth & Lesley Rankine, and included remixes by Scott Firth, Pumajaw & Engine7.
A remix EP, "Type 2.0" was released on 18 November 2013, with remixes by Rozio, Geek Boy, John Davis and Michael Travis/The Difference Engine.
Further music videos for "Last Life" and "Lush", from the "Revert To Type" EP were released in 2013.
1996 tour.
Of the duo only Rankine went on the road; Walk did not participate in performing the live shows. With Rankine on vocals the touring band consisted of Chris Taplin on bass/guitar, Gavin Fawcett on drums, Sharon Dougherty on keyboard/guitar (replaced by Regina Chellew mid tour). "Ruby" performed at the Pukkelpop music festival, the Reading Festival, and Lollapalooza during 1996, in support of the album "Salt Peter."
2001 tour.
"Ruby's" North American tour supporting "Short-Staffed At The Gene Pool" started off with a huge hitch: lost effects equipment for a group that uses only effects to perform their music live. Rankine relates the story in the same 2001 interview:

Tingly

"Tingly" was a song recorded by Pop! featuring Angie Hart. It was written by Tony Stott and John Richards, as a side project from their band About Six Feet, and recorded in an hour on Good Friday 1995. The vocals were performed by Angie Hart, who was then in the highly successful band Frente. It was released at the end of 1995 and became a popular song on the radio, making it on to Triple J Hottest 100, 1995. It was also featured in dozens of episodes of Neighbours and Home And Away, and was featured on the first "Home And Away" soundtrack album.
Named "Single of the Week" in both Beat Magazine and 3D, and "Single Of The Year" in the Sydney Telegraph Mirror, "Tingly" was particularly loved by JJJ's Richard Kingsmill. Kingsmill was instrumental in its release, having played it repeatedly when it was sent to him as a demo recording. He was originally asked to stop playing it by White Records, home of Frente, who had not given permission for Hart to make the recording. In the end, White - somewhat begrudgingly - released it as a 5-track single, but refused to make a video for it. There was concern in the company that the song would harm Frente's move to a more adult sound, which they were trying with the Shape album (released a year later in 1996). While never a hit, it received critical acclaim and sold well over a long period.

Zhu Yi (Three Kingdoms)

Zhu Yi (died 257), courtesy name Jiwen, was a military general of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. He was Zhu Huan's son.
Life.
Zhu Yi gained his first military appointment upon the death of his father in 238. His first field assignment was in 241 when he followed Zhu Ran in the latter's assault on Fancheng, but it would be his victory over Cao Wei's Wen Qin that cemented his reputation as a capable commander. Zhu Yi personally led 2,000 troops to destroy all seven of Wen Qin's encampments, decapitating several hundred men in the process, and earning him a promotion to full general. The Wu emperor Sun Quan remarked afterward that Zhu Yi was even braver and sturdier than he had heard.
In 252 Zhu Yi thwarted an invasion by Wei, when he led a naval force to attack and destroy the floating bridges Wei generals Hu Zun (胡遵) and Zhuge Dan were building to cross into Wu territory.
When Zhuge Dan revolted against the increasing power of the Sima clan, the Wu regent Sun Chen dispatched an army of 30,000 to aid Zhuge Dan in Shouchun, and dispatched another 30,000 led by Zhu Yi to a city just south of Shouchun to act as rearguard. Zhu Yi's force was defeated and pursued by Zhou Tai (州泰), with over 2,000 casualties. Sun Chen then ordered another 50,000 men, commanded in part by Zhu Yi, to attack the Wei forces. Leaving his baggage train and the bulk of his forces at Dulu (都陸), he travelled upstream and made a night crossing on floating bridges with 6,000 of his bravest fighters, but his forces were detected and defeated by Zhou Tai and Shi Bao (石苞). Zhu Yi regrouped but was again driven back. Moreover, Wei officer Hu Lie (胡烈) led 5,000 men in a sneak attack on Zhu Yi's baggage train, burning his supplies and grain.
Sun Chen sent another 30,000 men to assist Zhu Yi and fight the Wei forces to the death, if necessary, but Zhu Yi was unwilling to fight without supplies or food, and Sun Chen, enraged, had him beheaded in his camp.

Australian banking crisis of 1893

The 1893 banking crisis occurred in Australia when several of the commercial banks of the colonies within Australia collapsed. 
During the 1880s there was a speculative boom in the Australian property market. Australian banks were operating in a free banking system, in addition to few legal restrictions on the operation of banks, there was no central bank and no government-provided deposit guarantees. The commercial banks lent heavily, but following the asset price collapse of 1888, companies that had borrowed money started to declare bankruptcy. The full banking crisis became apparent when the Federal Bank failed on 30 January 1893. By 17 May, 11 commercial banks had suspended trading.

<doc id="5900235" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5900235" title="Special Interrogation Group">
Special Interrogation Group

The Special Interrogation Group (SIG) (some sources interpret this acronym as "Special Identification Group" or "Special Intelligence Group") was a unit of the British Army during World War II. It was organized from German-speaking Jewish volunteers from the British Mandate of Palestine. The SIG performed commando and sabotage operations against Axis forces during the Western Desert Campaign.
Formation.
The inspiration for the SIG belonged to Captain Herbert Cecil Buck, MC of the 3rd Bn., 1st Punjab Regiment and later the Scots Guards, an Oxford scholar and German linguist. He had been captured in January 1942, but had soon managed to break free and had then escaped back across Libya to Egypt, partly using German uniforms and vehicles. He was surprised by the ease of his deception and felt that, with greater planning and preparation, the concept could be used more offensively, to assist raiding parties attack key targets behind enemy lines. His plan was approved and, in March 1942, he was appointed the commander of this new unit, the SIG. 
In March 1942, Col. Terence Airey (Military Intelligence Research at the War Office in London) wrote that "a Special German Group as a sub-unit of ME[ast Commando... with the cover name 'Special Interrogation Group', to be used for infiltration behind the German lines in the Western Desert, under 8th Army... the strength of the Special Group would be approximately that of a platoon... The personnel are fluent German linguists... mainly Palestinian (Jews) of German origin. Many of them have had war experience with No. 51 Commando..." 
Some personnel was also recruited directly from the Palmach, Haganah and the Irgun. Other recruits came from the Free Czechoslovak Forces, the French Foreign Legion and German-speaking Jewish troops. The SIG was a part of D Squadron, First Special Service Regiment. Its strength varied between 20 and 38, according to various sources.
Training.
According to ex-SIG member Maurice "Tiffen" Monju Tiefenbrunner, their first training base was located near Suez. The SIG were trained in desert navigation, unarmed combat, handling of German weapons and explosives. They were given fake German identities and were taught German marching songs and current German slang. For their missions, they were supplied with German pay books, cigarettes, chocolates, and even love letters from fictitious sweethearts in Germany. 
Walter Essner and Herbert Brueckner, two non-Jewish Germans, had been conscripted from a POW camp to train the SIG. Before the war, both had been members of the French Foreign Legion who had been captured in November 1941 serving in the 361st Regiment of the Afrika Korps and were subsequently recruited by the British Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre (CSDIC) as double agents.
Operations and betrayal.
The SIG drove captured German vehicles behind German lines near Bardia, set up roadblocks and carried out acts of sabotage. Dressed as German military police, they stopped and questioned German transports, gathering important military intelligence. 
On June 3, 1942, the SIG was assigned its first assault mission: They were to assist the Special Air Service, led by Lt. Col. David Stirling in destroying Luftwaffe airfields which were threatening the Malta Convoys. These airfields were located 100 miles west of Tobruk at Derna and Martuba in the Italian colony of Libya. 
During the raid, on the night of 13-14 June,
Disbandment.
On September 13-14, 1942, the SIG participated in Operation Agreement, the raid on Tobruk. Its objective was to destroy the Afrika Korps' vital supply port. The SIG were to play the role of German guards transporting three truckloads of British POWs to a camp at Tobruk. The assault failed and the British forces lost three ships and several hundred soldiers and Marines.
Surviving SIG members were transferred to the Pioneer Corps.
Tiefenbrunner account of SIG.
In January 1999, Maurice (Monju) Tiefenbrunner, a surviving member of SIG, recorded his life story in an unpublished autobiography booklet called "A Long Journey Home". On pages 37–41, he provides information on SIG unit formation and operations. A sample scan of the first pages is shown to the right.
After the SIG was disbanded, Tiefenbrunner was caught by the Italians, and sent to a POW camp in Italy. He was moved to a POW camp in Nazi German territory, where he met Vic Crockford. They were released in early 1945.
Film.
The 1967 film "Tobruk" was about a raid of the SIG and the LRDG (Long Range Desert Group) on a German Afrika Korps fuel depot in Tobruk, starring Rock Hudson and George Peppard.

Kane Phillips

Kane Phillips is a fictional character from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera "Home and Away", played by Sam Atwell. He first appeared during the episode airing on 9 April 2001 and made his final appearance on 5 March 2009.
Character development.
Cancer.
In 2004, viewers saw Kane undergo a battle with Testicular Cancer. Atwell told of the lengths his character goes to hide his illness from his wife, Kirsty (Christie Hayes). “He’s just focused on not ruining Kirsty’s exam chances.” He added; “Then Kirsty turns up to babysit and Kane hides in the surgery. But when he realises his mobile is in the house he creates a diversion to grab it and even wears a disguise!” 
Storylines.
2001-05.
Kane is first seen in school at Summer Bay High, when a group of Year 9 students talk about a Dance party he is hosting. Kane tries to woo one of his teachers, Shauna Bradley (Kylie Watson) by getting her tickets to see Savage Garden in concert but she declines. Kane's brother, Phillips (Home and Away)|Scott] (Nathaniel Dean) kidnaps Shauna and Kane is forced into being an accessory, however, he later saves Shauna.
Kane tries his luck with Dani Sutherland (Tammin Sursok), who is currently on a break from Will Smith (Zac Drayson). This leads to Kane raping Dani one day while they are alone in at her house. Will finds out and incensed and starts a fight with Kane but is jumped by several of Kane's friends. Local headmaster Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn) intervenes but is given a kicking for his troubles. Kane stands trial with Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) presiding as the judge and is found not guilty, leaving Dani distraught. After Kane tearfully apologizes to Dani, he leaves the bay.
The following year, Kane returns to the bay and agrees to a mediation session with Dani and local counsellor Flynn Saunders (Martin Dingle-Wall. This fails when Dani refuses to forgive him as she is still having nightmares. Kane later takes a job aboard a boat named The Mirgini which is to set sail for the sesquentenary celebrations of Summer Bay. It doesn't sit well when Dani's family and boyfriend Josh West (Daniel Collopy) discover this. The boat begins sinking and Kane is washed up on a deserted beach with Dani's mother Shelley (Paula Forrest) and sister Kirsty for a week. Kane saves Shelley from a snake and the three of them are eventually rescued.
Kane begins a relationship with Kirsty, which they must keep secret. Eventually, Shelley finds out and tells her husband, Rhys (Michael Beckley) and he warns Kane off. The couple then run away as they can't live without each other. While on the run, Kane struggles to find them work and Kirsty is nearly sexually assaulted by a drunk. Kane realizes he has to take Kirsty back home, but she refuses. Kane, being cruel to be kind, calls her a kid and throws her out of his car.
Kane soon returns to win Kirsty back. Seb Miller (Mitch Firth), Kirsty's current boyfriend takes exception to Kane and punches him. Kirsty can't fight her feelings for Kane and they reunite, breaking Seb's heart. When Kane and Kirsty become common knowledge once more, Dani decides to accept it as she feels trying to keeping them apart will only bring them closer together. When Dani drives back from university once night, she runs over Kane. Kane is rushed to hospital and Kirsty arrives by his bedside keeping a constant vigil. Kane cannot remember the whole story at first but eventually tells the police. Kane wants Kirsty to use his version of events when questioned but the police question Kirsty at home. Dani later stands trial, with Morag as the judge once again. When the prosecutor insinuates that Dani wanted to kill Kane, she breaks down on the stand admitting so. The jury render a verdict of guilty and Dani is imprisoned. Kane leaves town in the aftermath of the trial for a while. After the Sutherlands fall into a mineshaft, Kane is accused. He helps with the search and manages to dig the family out, injuring his hands in the process. In spite of this, Rhys is still frosty with Kane.
Kane later proposes to Kirsty and she accepts. Their secret wedding is held on the same day as Rhys' wedding to Beth Hunter (Clarissa House). Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) offers the couple a room with her at the beach house. Kirsty later tells Kane she is pregnant with his baby but this is revealed to be a lie. Kane nearly strikes Kirsty during an argument, and she flees and when she returns, Kirsty takes out an AVO against Kane. They reconcile and Kirsty does fall pregnant for real but tragically miscarries.
Sarah Lewis (Luisa Hastings-Edge) tells Kirsty Kane is cheating on her but he denies it. Kane and Kirsty are drawn into a hostage situation with Sarah and several other Summer Bay residents which culminates in Sarah shooting Noah Lawson (Beau Brady) dead before committing suicide. Several weeks later, Kane discovers he has testicular cancer but decides to keep it quiet as Kirsty is taking her HSC. He tells Flynn, a doctor and his wife, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) that he plans to tell Kirsty that he is going away on a boat trip for a week so she will not suspect he is having an operation. Kirsty eventually finds out and stands by him.
Kane is shocked when his father Gus (Peter Lamb) reappears in his life and is very hostile towards him as he and Scott had beaten him in his childhood. After being convinced to give Gus a second chance by Kirsty, Kane find himself framed for a robbery that he didn't commit. Kane tries to contact Gus via an incarcerated Scott (now played by Josh Rosenthal) but gets nowhere. Morag, who previously ruled in Kane's favor twice before in court, defends him. The evidence is stacked against Kane and Scott lies during his testimony, exacerbating Kane's plight. Before the jury return a verdict, Kane tells Kirsty to pack and they flee the bay, with Kirsty several months pregnant.
2008-09.
Three years on, Irene receives a mysterious phone call and goes to meet Kirsty. She agrees to look after Kane and Kirsty's son, Oliver (Oliver Davis), who is now three years old. Kane later turns up at the beach house who tells her that he and Kirsty want her to raise Oliver, as being on the run is no place for a child. Kirsty wants to give herself up after being on the run, but unknown to her Kane robs the diner and attempts turn over a jewellery store in Yabbie Creek but is stopped by Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleason). Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) discovers Kane but is held at gunpoint.
Irene realises Oliver is missing and figures Kane and Kirsty are fleeing again. Officers Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien) and Lara Fitzgerald (Rebecca George) begin a car chase with Kane and Kirsty. The car is found abandoned and the police eventually corner Kane. After being quizzed about his crimes, it transpires that Kane has pulled several robberies across several states. Morag agrees to represent Kane but he decides to accept a deal to plead guilty to all charges in exchange for the exoneration of Irene and Kirsty. Kane is then jailed. Months later, Kane sends Kirsty a letter begging her to help him with money to fund an appeal and regular letters are exchanged between the two as Kirsty tries find the money for him.
At end of the year, a delighted Oliver runs into Kane at the Caravan Park and Kane asks him to lie to Kirsty about seeing him. Oliver can't keep it a secret but Kirsty and her new partner Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart) don't believe him, thinking he is just missing his Father. When Kane arrives, Miles and Kirsty are shocked.
Kane tries to win Kirsty back but is turned down. He tries again on the night of the school formal and is rejected again. Teenagers Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best) ask Kane for a lift to look for Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell), who has recently left a mental institute. They find Melody in the middle of the road, Kane swerves to avoid her and ends up crashing into the Diner, injuring himself and several other attendees of the formal. Kane recovers in hospital and asks Kirsty to leave with him, which she does after ending things with Miles. In a matter of weeks, Kane and Kirsty are back and they are having some problems. Kane later punches Miles, which Jai and Oliver witness. Kane concedes defeat when he realises Kirsty no longer loves him and leaves for his new job alone.

<doc id="5900320" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5900320" title="CYP1B1">
CYP1B1

Cytochrome P450 1B1 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the "CYP1B1" gene.
Function.
CYP1B1 belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. The enzyme encoded by this gene localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and metabolizes procarcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 17beta-estradiol. 
Despite over 20 years of research of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, CYP1B1 was not identified and sequenced until 1994. Nucleic and amino acid analysis showed approximately 40% identity with CYP1A1. Despite this similarity, these two enzymes have very different catalytic efficiencies and metabolites when incubated with common substrates, such as retinoic acid and arachidonic acid. Recently CYP1B1 has been shown to be physiologically important in fetal development, since mutations in CYP1B1 are linked with a form of primary congenital glaucoma.
CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are regulated by the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a ligand activated transcription factor. They are part of the Phase I reactions in drug metabolism.
Clinical significance.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with primary congenital glaucoma; therefore it is thought that the enzyme also metabolizes a signaling molecule involved in eye development, possibly a steroid.

<doc id="5900323" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5900323" title="Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel">
Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel

The Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill, Jr. Tunnel is a highway tunnel built as part of the Big Dig in Boston, Massachusetts. It carries the Central Artery underneath downtown Boston, and is numbered as Interstate 93, U.S. Route 1, and Route 3. It roughly follows the route of the old elevated Central Artery, though the northbound entrance, at the corner of Kneeland St. and Atlantic Ave., is somewhat east of the southbound exit (at Kneeland and Albany St.) to allow for a reconfigured interchange with the Massachusetts Turnpike. It runs from the Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge at its north portal to Boston's Chinatown at its south portal.
History.
The O'Neill Tunnel was and remains quite controversial due to the high price of the construction and what was found to be mediocre workmanship. The deep side walls of the tunnel (over in some areas) had to be constructed using slurry wall construction. The tunnel is leaky due to the high groundwater levels in the area and the improper construction of the slurry walls, a situation that has led to additional controversy in the wake of the considerable controversy over massive cost overruns and corruption allegations during the project.
Upon its completion in 2006, Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney proposed to name it the Liberty Tunnel. The state legislature and the Massachusetts delegation to Congress opposed the choice, and it was officially named after O'Neill (a longtime Speaker of the United States House of Representatives) by Section 1930 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which was passed by Congress and signed by then-President George W. Bush in 2005.
Exit list.
There is no direct access to Logan Airport within the northbound tunnel; airport traffic must get off at Exit 20 in the South Bay area to take Interstate 90 eastbound.
Access to Cambridge is provided by Exit 26, which feeds the Leverett Circle Connector bridge from Somerville to Storrow Drive.

Pale (Greyhawk)

In the "World of Greyhawk" campaign setting for the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game, the Pale, properly known as the Theocracy of the Pale, is a political state situated in the Old Aerdy West region of the Flanaess, west of the Rakers.
History.
At the height of the Great Kingdom, the Head of the Church of Pholtus was given the title of Holy Censor, which brought duties of oversight of the court system. Later Overkings turned against the church and removed this title, prompting many Pholtus worshippers to begin feeling persecuted and flee to the area which now is the Pale. Fighting with the early settlers was Ceril the Relentless, who founded the Council of the Nine. In 342 CY, the first Theocrat of the Pale was chosen by the Council, though the land remained theoretically under Great Kingdom rule. But in 356 CY, Nyrond declared independence, claiming the Pale, which then tried to seize its own independence, but failed, remaining under Nyrondian rule.
In 450 CY, the leaders of the cult of Pholtus convinced the King of Nyrond to grant them independence in return for promises of mutual aid and assistance. This proved a hollow assurance, as the Pale's government has largely followed a policy of leaving its neighbors to be killed and then trying to bully them into handing over lands to it. It thus remained neutral in the Greyhawk Wars. In 588 CY, the Pale's forces invaded and seized eastern Tenh.
Geography.
A land of moderate size, the Pale is bordered by the Rakers, the Phostwood, and the Gamboge. The Pale is divided into nine archdioceses.
Climate.
It is said the Pale has only two seasons, the unbearable winter and the barely bearable summer, when crops can, with difficulty, be grown.
People.
The native folk of the Theocracy of the Pale are primarily Flan/Oeridian hybrids, and are considered particularly handsome by folk from all corners of the Flanaess. Those with significant Flan heritage are considered lowborn by the Aerdi upper class, and intermarriage between the two groups is rare. Oddly, those with Flan heritage are considered more attractive than the purebred Aerdi. The Flan-descended Palish tend to stick to the countrysides, working as farmers and day laborers, and they tend to stick close to the "pagan" faiths persecuted by the Pholtus-worshiping Oeridians. A few Palish families contain half-elves, especially in the south.
The Pale's society has been relatively closed and stagnant since Nyrond first invaded the country more than two centuries ago, and has been living under an inquisition since that time.
Population.
The Pale boasts a total population of 395,000, 96% of which are human. The others include a very small number of halflings and elves.
Religion.
The faith of Pholtus, god of Light, Resolution, and Law, is the official religion of the Pale. Religious intolerance exists within the Pale, with all religions suppressed except for that of Pholtus. A servant of Pholtus, Saint Ceril, is the Pale's patron saint.
All non-Pholtus-worshipping states and peoples of the Flanaess are considered pagans or heretics, and thus minor enemies of the state. Wizards are always suspected of heresy. The hierarchy of the Pale is particularly hostile to religions with criminal or evil aspects.
In secret, however, many leave offerings to Beory, the Oeridian agricultural gods, Phyton, and Wee Jas.
Monasteries near the western woods and the eastern foothills of the Rakers have some of the most impressive libraries and respected philosophers around.
Languages.
As a former province of the Great Kingdom, Common is a very common language in the Pale. The Flan spoken in neighboring Tenh is also spoken in the nation.
Government.
The Pale is a theocracy administered in the name of Pholtus, god of Light, Resolution, and Law. All government offices are held by Pholtan clerics. The Pale is ruled from Wintershiven by a religious bureaucracy with command over the military, law enforcement, economics, trade, and nearly every aspect of life.
Administrative divisions.
The Pale is divided into nine archdioceses, which are in turn divided into twenty-seven city wards and low dioceses.
Executive branch.
The Theocrat is selected from the Council of the Nine, and believed to be chosen by Pholtus himself to rule from the Throne of the Sun for the rest of his life.
Legislative branch.
The term "legislative branch" would be best used to describe the Council of the Nine, which assembles four times a year in Wintershiven to advise the Theocrat. However, the Theocrat's power is absolute, and all power to make laws ultimately rests in him.
Judicial branch.
The judges of the Pale, like every other government official, are priests of Pholtus.
Heraldry.
The Pale's coat of arms is blazoned thus: "Purpure, a pale ermine between an increscent dexter and a mullet of six points sinister or".
Economy.
Resources.
Much of the Pale's food comes from herd animals who feed on the tough vegetation, and much food is imported from other realms. The Pale's mines yield copper and gems.
Currency.
The Pale's coinage includes the Bright (platinum pieces), gold glory, silver sun, silver moon, and basic (copper pieces).
Military.
The Templars of the Church Militant work within the religious and military hierarchies, and are charged with conducting the Inquisition. The roaming High Legates are particularly feared for their ability to put those they meet to the Question. The soldiery of the Pale boasts some of the best training in the Flanaess, and the nation's borders are well patrolled and defended. Travel within the Pale is more peaceful than in most lands although the Troll Fens remain deadly.

Cithaeronidae

The Cithaeronidae are a small spider family with only seven described species in two genera.
Biology.
Cithaeronidae are fast-moving spiders that actively hunt at night. They rest during the day in silken retreats they construct below rocks. Female "Cithaeron" are about 5 to 7 mm long, males about 4 mm. They are pale yellowish, and have a preference for very hot, dry stony places.
Distribution.
While "Inthaeron" occurs only in India, members of the genus "Cithaeron" can be found in Africa, India and parts of Eurasia. Three adult females of "C. praedonius" were found in Teresina, Piauí, Brazil. As they were found in and near human housings, they presumably were accidentally introduced. This is probably also the case for finds in the Northern Territory of Australia.
Another population of "C. praedonius" has been discovered in Florida U.S.A., with reports of a stable breeding population.(Pers. comm. Joseph Stiles)

Letts nitrile synthesis

The Letts nitrile synthesis is a chemical reaction of aromatic carboxylic acids with metal thiocyanates to form nitriles. The reaction includes the loss of carbon dioxide and potassium hydrosulfide. The polar basic substitution reaction was discovered in 1872 by Edmund A. Letts.
History.
In 1857 Hugo Schiff observed that the reaction between benzoyl chloride with potassium cyanide produced the desired benzonitrile. Work done later by British chemist Edmund A. Letts delved much deeper into the synthesis of nitriles. Attempting first to add cyano-groups to acetic acid, he obtained a mixture of acetamide and carbonyl sulfide. However, in 1872 he showed that treating a 2:1 molecular ratio of benzoic acid and potassium thiocyanate with heat for several hours also produced nitriles with only a small amount of amide with about 40% yield.
G. Krüss expanded on Letts' work in 1884, producing better yields by utilizing lead(II) thiocyanate. The last major contributor to the reaction was E.E. Reids, who showed that the dry distillation of the zinc(II) salt of the acid with a 20% excess of lead(II) thiocyanate gave an 86% conversion and 91% yield, almost double of that produced by Letts.
Mechanism.
Kekulé proposed the reaction mechanism in 1873.
In this polar basic substitution reaction mechanism, thiocyanate ion extracts the acidic proton from benzoic acid while heated. This yields the conjugate base (stabilized by resonance structures) and thiocyanic acid.
The next step involves the evolution of carbon dioxide, where a lone moves from the negatively charged oxygen to form a double bond with the carboxylic carbon. The sigma bond between the ring and carboxyl group is then severed, the electron pair moving to the ring and delocalized through resonance structures.
The final step of the mechanism involves the attack of the phenyl anion attacking the cyano-carbon, pushing the electron pair over to the sulfur, which readily diffuses the negative charge and is further stabilized by the potassium ion, resulting in the final benzonitrile product and potassium hydrosulfide.
Applications.
Aromatic nitriles have a few applications, including polyrecombination to form polymers, are sometimes studied as biologically active molecules and undergoing Ritter reactions to form amides.
Benzonitrile, the original product of Letts, has multiple uses as a versatile reagent and as a solvent. Substituted benzonitriles are important in many fields including pharmaceuticals. Benzonitrile is a precursor in the synthesis of Fadrozole, an aromatase inhibitor used in the treatment of breast cancer. 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile, produced by the Nickel catalyzed cyanation of 4-chlorobenzotrifluoride is a precursor for the antidepressant Fluvoxamine.
Benzonitrile can also act a ligand in asymmetric catalysis, coordinating to transition metals and forming Lewis acids.

The World of Beachcomber

The World of Beachcomber was a surreal television comedy show produced by the BBC inspired by the Beachcomber column in the "Daily Express" newspaper.
The show, like the column, consisted of a series of unrelated pieces of humour. Links between the items were provided by Spike Milligan, dressed in a smoking jacket and cap, as in the cartoon logo above the newspaper column. The other actors were a Who's Who of British comedy of the time, encompassing almost every supporting player seen or heard in comedy, not excluding people of diminutive stature. Likewise the writing staff included Milligan, Barry Took, John Junkin, Neil Shand and others. The producer was John Howard Davies.
In all, 19 episodes were produced beginning in 1968. They were mostly shown on the new BBC 2 channel, which broadcast in colour using the 625-line PAL standard. BBC 2 was a minority-appeal culture channel, and thus allowed greater stretching of the boundaries of the art. Unfortunately, like many shows of the time, the original videotapes were wiped. Only one complete episode, on black and white 16mm film now survives of this show in the BBC archives, from the penultimate (20.10.69) edition. In addition to this, excerpts (origin unknown, but likely filmed inserts) for the 29.09.69 edition also survive. Audio soundtracks also survive for episodes Three (06.10.69) and Four (13.10.69) of the 1969 series. In addition to this, a soundtrack LP featuring excerpts from shows from series one was also released by PYE records, and rereleased on Audio Cassette in 1997.

Tracy Lamourie is a long time human rights activist and a director and co-founder of the Canadian Coalition Against the Death Penalty. Lamourie's work with the coalition resulted in a direct rebuke from Governor George W. Bush in 1999 over the threat of an international tourist boycott of Texas when the execution of convicted Canadian murderer Stan Faulder was pending. Faulder was executed in 1999 for the beating and stabbing death of 75 year-old Inez Phillips. 
Lamourie was also instrumental in obtaining a Federal court ruling on a First Amendment basis, overturning the law that prevented prisoners in Arizona from using a third party to post information on the internet about their cases. 
Lamourie was invited to meet with the Italian Ambassador to Canada and Italian Senators Melchiorre Cirami and Fausto Marchetti as guests of the Italian Embassy in Ottawa over concerns about Canada's extradition policy with the United States. The senators were given unprecedented intervenor access before the Supreme Court of Canada in United States v. Burns which ruled that Canada could not extradite people to face capital punishment without first receiving assurances that the death sentence would not be sought. The ruling also reaffirmed capital punishment as a violation of Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Lamourie has been featured on a number of radio news programs across North America and Europe as a representative of the CCADP, including Television appearances on Court TV, CBC, The Debra Duncan Show, and newspaper articles that include the "National Post", "Toronto Star", "Miami Herald", "Houston Chronicle", "Der Spiegel", "National Enquirer", and "People".

<doc id="5900433" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5900433" title="Le Château">
Le Château

Le Château Inc. is a fashion company founded in 1959 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada that designs, imports and retails a wide range of women's and men's apparel, accessories and footwear. In 2006, the company generated sales of nearly $303.88 million CAD. The company sells directly to customers with over 232 retail stores in Canada, one in the New York metropolitan area, as well as five throughout the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. As of 2007, Le Château employed more than 3,000 people worldwide. Le Château manufactures about 35% of the merchandise itself in Canadian factories with the remainder being imported. 
History.
Early years: 1959-1982.
Founded by Herschel Segal in 1959, as "Le Chateau Men's Wear", it began as a menswear store in downtown Montreal's Victoria Square, on St. Catherine's Street, a bustling shopping district at the time and a third store in Verdun on Wellington street. Segal gave his store a French name because of the budding francophone feelings occurring in Quebec. At first, Le Château was not a "fashion-forward" store, as it would later become, as Segal sold overstock from his father's old store. In 2003, Segal described his early customers as "old ... blue-haired ladies." Le Château did well at first, and three more stores were opened. However, by the early 1960s the company was close to bankruptcy, and all but the original store were closed.
In 1962, Le Château added women's clothing, shortened the name to "Le Château," and switched to selling the latest imported European fashions. The store imported from Carnaby Street in London, a fashion centre at the time, as well as other imports such as French suits and Italian turtlenecks. This worked well, and within a few years, Le Château completely phased out the original traditional clothing style to concentrate on selling fashionable imports to youths. Segal claims that Le Château was the first to introduce bell bottoms to Canada, and had the latest European fashion before it even arrived in New York. Le Château played an integral yet little known role in John Lennon and Yoko Ono's 1969 Montreal bed-in, providing the signature velour jumpsuits worn by the pair. By 1972, the chain grew to 10 stores, and by the end of the decade Le Château had over 50 stores across Canada. By this time, Le Château had shifted to selling mainstream fashion instead of the latest imports from Europe.
IPO and expansion: 1983-2003.
In December 1983, Le Château had its initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), where it has since remained. It raised $7.3 million. By the early 1990s, Le Château had 160 stores and had switched to doing most of its design and manufacturing itself. In the early 1990s, there was a prolonged recession in Canada which hurt most business in the clothing industry.
In the mid 90s Le Château experimented briefly with Goth styled clothing and in 1997, it launched a short lived adolescent girls brand "Jr. Girls."
In the 1990s, Le Château had become criticized for cheap clothing and achieved a nickname "Le Crapeau." By 1999, the company's stock fell to an eight-year low and the company took a large quarterly loss of $1.3 million in the three months ended July 29, 2000, compared with a profit of $1.1 million a year earlier. This led to a management shakeup, store redesign, changes to the merchandise, and according to Le Château, a concerted effort to improve its quality and image. Executives at Le Château said the company's designers went too avant-garde and the chain's younger market "recoiled."
Restructuring: 2003-2011.
In 2003, Segal acknowledged the "disposable fashion" stereotype, and said the company "forgot about" the product. "We might have been sloppy," he said. "But now we're putting in more money and time. We have an inspection system and a young lady who's a grad of a textile school. We never had that before." Since then, Le Château has been trying to build up its brand image, and shed the image that its clothes are "only for wearing to nightclubs," a view that still persists. That year, it released a collection based on the 1960s-set Renée Zellweger movie, Down with Love and was the exclusive supplier of clothing to Canadian Idol contestants.
Rebranding: 2012-.
With many US retailers expanding into Canada, including competitor Express, and fast fashion stores such as H&M and Zara gaining market share, Le Château relaunched their brand in 2012. The company went from apparel for young, trend-hungry shoppers to “new concept” stores carrying better quality, grown-up clothes at affordable price points. The rebranding was complete with a new logo and new white, sterile, more upscale stores, with nickel fixtures and glass shelving. Known for their tailored and form-fitting clothes, it sells formal wear, casual wear, evening wear, and footwear. Le Chateau now has over 240 stores in Canada. While Le Château is publicly traded, the company is tightly held with 67% of shares owned by Silverstone, the company's board, executives and two institutional investors. In addition, the shares have less than 2% of voting rights. The current CEO is Segal's wife, Jane Segal.
American expansion.
In 1985, two years after the IPO, Le Château opened its first store in the United States. Le Château opened 26 stores in the U.S. over the next couple of years, including in Boston, New York, Chicago, and Baltimore. However, the stores fared poorly, something Segal attributes today to bad locations, poor fashion choices for U.S. tastes, and "entrepreneurial arrogance." Within a few years, all the American locations except for one location in New York would close.

Saariselkä

Saariselkä (, literally "islandback") is a village located in a mountainous area in northern Finland. It is a popular tourist destination, providing activities such as skiing, hiking and a spa. It is located in Northern Lapland and belongs to the Inari municipality.
Saariselkä is partly in Urho Kekkonen National Park. Soil in Saariselkä is mostly 2 billion-year-old granulite. The last ice age ceased 9500 years ago in Saariselkä. Saariselkä village is about 300 meters above sea level. Kaunispää-fell, next to village, rise to 438 meters.
Trivia.
Many couples have wanted to have a literally "white wedding" in Lapland in the winter when there is snow everywhere. A couple may come in the chapel in a sledge pulled by husky dogs or reindeer. Pyhän Olavin Kappeli (St. Olaf's Chapel) and a small wooden Tievakappeli (Tieva Chapel) near Hotel & Igloo Village Kakslauttanen in Saariselkä have been popular places for white weddings. Other possible venues include reindeer farms.
Magnetic hill.
Part of the former Finnish Highway 4 in Saariselkä is known nowadays as "Magnetic hill". During World War II the road from Rovaniemi to Petsamo ("Arctic Ocean's Highway") was extremely important to the Finns. Petsamo and its harbour was the only open way to the ocean. The hills beside Kaunispää-fjeld are so steep that 1940's trucks could not easily climb them. Folks thought there was some magnetic force in the hill that squeezed all the power out of the motors. After a realignment of Highway 4 that short section was taken out of daily use. It has been declared the "Magnetic Hill Road Museum".

Waltz in A-flat major, Op. 69, No. 1 (Chopin)

Waltz in A-flat major, Op. 69, No. 1, is a waltz composed by Frédéric Chopin. It is also called "The Farewell Waltz" or "Valse de l'adieu".
History.
The waltz was originally written as a farewell piece to Maria Wodzińska, to whom Chopin was once engaged. This autographed copy "Pour Mlle Marie", given to her in Dresden, Germany, in September 1835, is now in the National Library ("Biblioteka Narodowa") of Poland in Warsaw. Another autographed version of the piece can be found at the "Conservatoire de Paris", but is considered to be a less refined version. A third is presented as the posthumous edition of Julian Fontana, but has not been substantiated by any known autograph.
Music.
The waltz is in A-flat major, with a time signature of 3/4. The tempo is marked at "tempo di valse", or a waltz tempo. The beginning theme, marked "con espressione", is melancholic and nostalgic, and reaches a small high point with a fast flourish. The second part is marked "sempre delicatissimo", or "con anima" in other versions. It is somewhat more cheerful than the previous theme, but soon gives way to the same first theme. After a second rendition of the first theme is a third theme, marked as "dolce", the most playful theme. It leads to another theme with a series of ascending double-stops. This fourth theme is marked "poco a poco crescendo", with other editions adding "ed appassionato". This leads back to the third, playful theme, and returns to the beginning with a "da capo al fin".

List of Romanesque buildings

Listed below are examples of surviving buildings in Romanesque style in Europe, sorted by modernday countries.
List.
France.
Romanesque architecture expands in France through monasteries. Burgundy was the center of monastic life in France - one of the most important Benedictine monastery of medieval Europe was the one in Cluny. The pilgrimage also contributed to expansion of this style. Many pilgrims passed through France on their way to Santiago de Compostela.
French Romanesque schools of architecture, which are specific for every region, are characterised by the variety of stone vaulting.
Italy.
In Italy, the prevalent diffusion is in Lombardy, in Emilia - Romagna, in Tuscany, in the continental part of Veneto and in Apulia; everyone of these "Romanesque styles" has proper characteristics, for constructing methods and for materials. For example, a characteristic of Romanesque is that to change the classic elements with Christian elements, but in Tuscany and Apulia the classic decoratings remain.
Materials depended from the local disponibility, because the importation was too expensive. In fact, in Lombardy the most used material is ceramic, because of the argillous nature of the terrain; but that is not true for Como, where there were large diponibility of stone; in Tuscany buildings in white marble (from Carrara) are frequent, with inserts of green serpentin marble.
In Lombardy and Emilia, in that age united, in Romanesque epoque there was a great artistic flowering. The most monumental churches and cathedrals are often built with the "campata" system, with varying columns which weigh "a tutto sesto arco"s. In plain the material of construction is prevalently the mattone, but buildings in stone do not lack. The greater part of the Roman cities along the via Emilia is equipped in this age of monumental cathedral, between which they already maintain to the medieval system.

Spain.
Romanesque first developed in Spain in the 10th and 11th centuries and before Cluny`s influence, in Lérida, Barcelona, Tarragona and Huesca and in the Pyrinees, simultaneously with the north of Italy, into what has been called "First Romanesque" or "Lombard Romanesque". It is a very primitive style, whose characteristics are thick walls, lack of sculpture and the presence of rhythmic ornamental arches.
Romanesque architecture truly arrives with the influence of Cluny through the Way of Saint James, that ends in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. The model of the Spanish Romanesque in 12th century was the Cathedral of Jaca, with its characteristic apse structure and plan, and its "chess" decoration in strips, called "taqueado jaqués". As the Christian kingdoms advanced to the South, that model spread throughout the reconquered areas with some variations. Spanish Romanesque has also influence of the Spanish pre-Romanesque styles, mainly the Asturian and the Mozarab. But there is also a strong influence of the moorish architecture, so close in space, especially the vaults of Córdoba`s Mosque, and the polylobulated arches. In the 13th century, some Romanesque churches alternated with the Gothic. Aragón, Castile and Navarra are some of the most dense areas of Spanish Romanesque.
United Kingdom.
England.
In England, Romanesque architecture is often termed 'Norman architecture'. Castles, cathedrals and churches of the Norman period have frequently been extended during later periods. It is normal to find Norman in combination with Gothic architecture.

Cade's County

"Cade's County" is a modern-day Western/crime drama which aired on CBS during the 1971–1972 television season. There were 24 episodes.
Synopsis.
"Cade's County" starred well-known Hollywood actor Glenn Ford as Sam Cade, the sheriff of the fictional Madrid County, a vast and sparsely populated desert area that was apparently located well inland in the American Southwest. The state in which it was located was never mentioned; it could have been California (where much of the location filming took place), Utah, Nevada, New Mexico or Arizona. Cade made occasional references to going to "Capital City" for hearings and meetings. There is a town named Madrid, New Mexico, however, it is pronounced "MAD-rid," and is not a county seat.
Cade's character was complex and interesting, though never fully developed. He came from a socially prominent and well-to-do family in the county, had served in the U.S. Navy as a fighter pilot — there was one reference to the Korean War — and had been an FBI agent, after which he returned to Madrid County to become sheriff. There were no references to a wife or close family in the series.
His chief deputy was J. J. Jackson, portrayed by the character actor Edgar Buchanan. While Cade had traveled the world, and had modern law enforcement training, Jackson had apparently spent most of his life and career in Madrid County. Writers avoided the stereotypical combination of "resistant-to-change veteran" and "newly hatched expert" – Jackson was a capable and competent right-hand man, Cade firmly in control but trusted by his people, who called him "Sam."
Together they fought to maintain law and order against violent miners, cattle thieves and other lawbreakers who, for the most part, would have seemed at home in Westerns set in any era. Cade usually drove a jeep, as many of the roads in his jurisdiction were apparently little more than tracks across the sand.
Several of the characters, including some of Cade's deputies, were native Americans. Another deputy was played by Ford's son, Pete (also the name of his character).
After summer hiatus, "Cade's County" was replaced in the 1972-1973 fall TV season by a new series entitled "M*A*S*H". A feature-length movie assembled from several episodes of "Cade's County" was released in 1991 in VHS format under the title "Sam Cade — Marshal of Madrid". A two-part episode, "Slay Ride", was released as a television feature film, occasionally broadcast by independent television stations.
The musical theme for the show was composed by Henry Mancini. The title music appeared in an expanded version in the album "Big Screen, Little Screen".

James Arthur Williams

James Arthur Williams (or Jim Williams) (December 11, 1930 - January 14, 1990) was the only person in the state of Georgia ever to be tried four times for the same crime – the alleged murder of his assistant, Danny Lewis Hansford, on May 2, 1981, in Williams's home, Mercer House.
Life.
Williams was born in Gordon, Georgia. As a noted Savannah, Georgia antiques dealer and historic preservationist, he played an active role in the preservation of Savannah's historic district. In 1955, he bought and restored his first three old houses at 541, 543 and 545 East Congress Street when he was just 24 years old. Over the next 35 years, he would restore more than 50 homes in Savannah and the lowcountry of Georgia and South Carolina. Notable Savannah houses he restored include: Odingsell House, Merault House, Hampton Lillibridge House, Habersham's Pink House, Armstrong House and Mercer House.
In 1969, Williams purchased the home, which was originally built for General Hugh Weedon Mercer, great-grandfather of songwriter Johnny Mercer. It had been vacant for almost a decade since its last occupants, the Shriners organization, had used the building as their Alee Temple. For two years, Williams painstakingly restored the home, which he used as his personal residence while operating his antiques restoration business out of the carriage house in the rear of the mansion.
Arrest and trials.
Williams was arrested in 1981 for the shooting death of Danny Hansford, with whom he had a sexual relationship. After the subsequent four trials, Williams was finally acquitted by a jury in Augusta, Georgia in 1989.
Bobby Lee Cook defended Williams during the first trial. Williams was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He appealed, posting a $200,000 bond. Cook subsequently received, anonymously, a copy of the police report showing that the arresting officer had contradicted himself. The judgment was overturned and a new trial was ordered.
Sonny Seiler assumed Williams's defense at the second trial and decided to have Williams openly bring up his sexuality. Little else differed from the first trial. The Georgia Supreme Court overturned the conviction saying the sheriff should not have been allowed to testify as an expert, and that the prosecutor waited until his closing argument to demonstrate some evidence.
New evidence at the third trial showed the victim’s hands were not bagged by the police at the crime scene, a possible explanation for the lack of gunpowder residue. During deliberations, a juror supposedly called a paramedic to ask some medical questions, though it could not be proven. After two deliberations, the jury still had not reached a verdict, one woman adamantly insisting she saw reasonable doubt and would not alter her verdict. With 11:1 jurors in favor of a "guilty" verdict, it was declared a hung jury and resulted in a mistrial. 
The fourth trial began two years later with a change of venue to Augusta, Georgia. The jury took one hour to come back with a verdict of not guilty.
Death.
On January 14, 1990, six months after the trial, Williams died unexpectedly in his home, aged 59, from pneumonia and heart failure. It is often said that Williams fell dead in nearly the same spot where Danny Hansford was shot to death nearly a decade earlier, but he in fact died in the foyer outside of the office where Danny Hansford was shot. He is buried next to his mother, Blanche Brooks Williams, in Ramah Church Cemetery, Gordon, Georgia.

Prodidomidae

The Prodidomidae are a spider family with about 300 species in 31 genera. They are sometimes called Long-Spinneret Ground Spiders.
This family is part of the superfamily Gnaphosoidea. They are easily identified by the greatly elongated base of the piriform gland spigots. At least parts of their body are covered with shiny scales or setae. The posterior median eyes are flat and silvery, with a triangular, egg-shaped or irregularly rectangular shape.
Biology.
Prodidomidae are ground dwellers. Most species are nocturnal and hide during the day in litter, but "Myandra", which are probably mimicking ants, seems to be active during the day.
The genus "Zimiris" is synanthropic and thus found worldwide in the tropics.
Distribution.
Although "Theuma walteri" was described from Turkmenistan by Eugène Simon, it is suspected that Simon accidentally exchanged its locality with that of "Anagraphis pallens" (Gnaphosidae); then "T. walteri" would have been collected in the Cape of Good Hope, while "A. pallens" is from Turkmenistan.
Systematics.
The Prodidomidae are considered "higher gnaphosoids", together with the Lamponidae and Gnaphosidae. These share anterior lateral spinnerets consisting of only a single article, while the lower gnaphosoids retain a separate, complete distal article that is represented by an entire, subdistal ring of sclerotized cuticle.

Pierre Caroli

Pierre Caroli (born 1480 in Rozay-en-Brie, died in 1550, possibly in Rome) was a French refugee and religious figure.
He was a Doctor of theology of the University of Paris, and was receptive to the ideas of the Protestant Reformation. However, he entered into open confrontation with John Calvin, the central figure of French Protestantism. In a theological dispute, Caroli accused Calvin and Guillaume Farel of Arianism and Sabellianism. 
Caroli was a teacher of theology in Paris in 1520. There he had been under the influence of a leader of the humanists, Jacques Faber Stapulensis (Lefèvre d'Etaples), and belonged to the group supporting the return of the bishop Guillaume Briçonnet de Meaux. He was professor in the Sorbonne for some years. However, in 1525, his theses on the "Epistles of Paul" had unleashed an attack on him by of the censorship, and he was expelled from the Sorbonne. 
The sister of the king, Margaret of Angoulême, called on his services and gave him in 1530 a position in a parish in Alençon. In 1534, the Protestants were persecuted. Like Calvin, Caroli was a fugitive. He went to Geneva in 1535 and joined Farel there. Shortly afterwards he went to Basel, where he studied Hebrew and became a friend of Simon Grynaeus and Oswald Myconius. In 1536 he took part in the great theological dispute in Lausanne, supporting the reformation cause. 
In consequence of his participation in the dispute, he gained recognition in Bern, which nominated him as the first pastor of Lausanne. He entered then into conflict with Calvin and Farel, having run away from Lausanne, leaving his wife and abandoning the Protestant faith. The government of Bern banished Caroli in 1537. Caroli moved to Montpellier. Expelled from France, he went in 1539 to Neuenberg, where he made peace with the Swiss reformers, without however receiving any position.

NuTech Digital

NuTech Digital is a US corporation that translates, packages, and dubs hentai anime, live-action pornography, and concerts.
History.
In 2003, Nutech developed a Digital Rights Management application that would work with DVD download, rentals and peer to peer networks like KaZaA, Limewire, and Morpheus. The application was aimed at preventing piracy and included the capabilities to self-delete works from the computer after a set number of plays or days from download. In November, NuTech signed a deal for exclusive rights to Happinet Pictures Corporation works in North America, Canada, and Mexico. The agreement was made after the initial success of "Words Worth" and resulted in obtaining rights to the final two episodes and works like Immoral Sisters and Genmukan.
In March 2004, NuTech entered into a distribution deal with Liberty International Entertainment Inc. for 65 classical music titles. In May, it secured a million dollar contract with Dollar Tree stores for its DVD content. In June, NuTech became aware that its stock was listed on the Berlin-Bremen Stock Exchange without their consent or permission. NuTech enlisted U.S. attorneys Richardson & Patel to remove the listing, which was done so five days later. NuTech's official stance was that this was a shorting scheme to drive the cost of the stock down.
In 2005, NuTech had begun moving away from distribution of animation to focus on producing and distributing music concerts, but during this time hentai titles accounted for 59% of its sales. In May, NuTech signed a multi-year agreement to deliver its content through CinemaNow's broadband video-on-demand service. In November 2005, Ken Groove Media sued NuTech over $300,000 in bounced checks and violation of contract for NuTech's digital streaming and possibly violating its pricing guidelines of the contract. As a result of the lawsuit, the rights of 34 titles were transferred to Adult Source Media.
In January 2006, NuTech filed a lawsuit against rapper Mike Jones, claiming at least $116,846 in damages after Mike Jones allegedly failed to show up for an October 10 concert. Also in 2006, NuTech entered into a licensing agreement over its content to MusicGiants.
Divisions.
Anime Division.
Listed under the Digital Versatile and Nutech brands, NuTech was ranked the 5th Leading Supplier for 2002 anime releases, with 54 releases. NuTech's rivals included Pioneer with 133 titles, ADV Films with 89 titles, Media Blasters with 62 titles and Funimation with 55 titles released for 2002.
The titles it acquired have since been redistributed to other companies, such as Critical Mass and Kitty Media.
NuTech Platinum Concert Series.
NuTech Platinum Concert Series was a division created in 2001 to capitalize the market for DVDs of live concert performances, capturing them with the companies equipment. Contracts included NuTech to retain internet and television broadcast rights to the performances. NuTech teamed up with Morris Marketing, a well-known Hollywood public relations agency, to promote the new division.
Telco operations.
In 2007, NuTech purchased Jump Communications assets which were valued at $3.7 million with the intention of expanding their market and to better compete in the telecommunications market.
Titles.
In 2001, NuTech announced that it has acquired the rights to D+Vine (Luv), él, Angels in the Court, Inmu 2, Karakuri Ninja Girl, Words Worth, Bizarre Cage, Black Mail 2, Immoral Sisters, Isaku, Isaku Respect, Luv Wave, Pure Mail, School of Darkness and Yu-No. As a result of the 2005 lawsuit 34 titles were transferred to Adult Source Media, these titles included: Chu², Class Reunion Again, Dark Shell, Dream Hazard, Harvest Night, Magical Kanan, Magic Kanan Special (Summer Camp), Maids in Dream, MaMa, Momiji, Pianist, Princess Memory, and Romance in the Flash of a Sword.

Fighting McCooks

The Fighting McCooks were members of a family of Ohioans who reached prominence as officers in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Two brothers, Daniel and John McCook, and thirteen of their sons were actively involved in the army, making the family one of the most prolific in American military history. Six of the McCooks reached the rank of brigadier general or higher. Several family members were killed in action or died from their wounds. Following the war, several others reached high political offices, including governorships and diplomatic posts.
The family.
Daniel McCook, a Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, attorney, had moved to eastern Ohio in 1826, settling in Carrollton. His younger brother John also soon moved to the Buckeye State. Their clans would become affectionately known as the "Tribe of Dan" and the "Tribe of John." Yet another brother, Dr. George McCook (1795-1873), and his son Dr. George Latimer McCook (1824-1874) served as unpaid surgeons during the Civil War, the latter serving under George B. McClellan during the Peninsula Campaign. Their father, another George McCook (1752-1822), had emigrated from Armoy, Ulster to Pennsylvania and had fought in the Whiskey Rebellion.
""Tribe of Dan""
""Tribe of John""
Daniel McCook's house in Carrollton, Ohio, is preserved as a museum. McCook Field, a former air station near Dayton, Ohio (1917–1927), was named in honor of the Fighting McCooks. A granite memorial to Daniel McCook, Jr. is at the Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield, and a marker to his father is located on State Route 124, near Buffington Island in the Ohio River.
A number of the McCooks, as well as wives and children, are interred in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio as well as Bend, Oregon and Miami, Florida.

<doc id="5900690" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5900690" title="Moon Maiden (comics)">
Moon Maiden (comics)

Moon Maiden is a DC Comics superhero who first appeared in "JLA Giant Size Special" #3 (October 2000). Dan Curtis Johnson and Dale Eaglesham created her. This has been her only appearance to date. It was a retcon story, written as if she had been a superhero and member of the Justice League for years.
Fictional character biography.
Hugh Klein was an American Astronaut on Apollo XXV, the last manned Moon mission. While on the Moon, Hugh discovered an ancient structure, thereafter referred to as the 'Lunar Villa'. Inside, Hugh finds an infant girl in a cradle, and is then confronted by a ghostly consortium identified as The Hundred. Caelius, speaker for the Hundred, explained how they were a group of scholars and philosophers devoted to peace who fled Rome during the time of the emperors. Using alchemical processes, they created the Lunar Villa and attempted to create a champion of their peaceful ideas on Earth. Unfortunately, they accidentally created the villain known as Valkus, the Centurion instead. To atone for this mistake, and to perpetuate their beliefs, they created a child they called the Praemonstra Supra, meaning "She Who Will Point the Way'. Hugh returned to Earth with the infant child, and he and his new wife, Jenny, were allowed to adopt and raise the infant, whom they named Laura.
Although Laura exhibited no outward super powers, she was always a brilliant and athletic child. When Laura turned 16, her powers of gravity control manifested. Hugh and Jenny explained Laura's origins to her, and she and Hugh travelled to the Lunar Villa, where the ghostly remains of the Hundred explained her origin and their purpose to them. At this point Laura embarked on her career as Laurel, the Moon Maiden.
She soon made many friends among the superhero community, was an early member of the Justice League, and shared at least one adventure with the Teen Titans. Throughout this time, her most frequent opponent was the Centurion.
During one of the Centurion's most grandiose schemes, he used a device called an Erasure Weapon, which was capable of erasing a being from history. After erasing several notable heroes from existence, Moon Maiden, along with the remaining members of the Justice League, the Teen Titans, and Infinity Inc. took the battle to the Centurion, in what was known as 'The Century War'. 
In an act of self-sacrifice, Moon Maiden, took herself and the Centurion high into the sky, and there destroyed his weapon, causing a great explosion, and removing the two of them from history. Only Hugh Klein was able to recall his daughter and the events that had occurred.
Moon Maiden eventually returned, wrapped up in the schemes of the also returned Centurion. Hugh was able to rekindle the memories of Laura's friends in the Justice League, and together they were able to free her from the Centurion and she was able to bring a close to his scheme. Afterwards, she felt somewhat lost, as most of the world still was unaware of her, but she had Hugh and her friends to help her rediscover this Earth which was now new to her.
Moon Maiden's only other appearances to date have been an appearance on the cover of "JLA/Avengers" #3 and a cameo (from the waist down) in the next issue, #4.
Powers and abilities.
Moon Maiden is able to manipulate the alchemical processes of the Hundred's Lunar Villa, and as such is able to manipulate the Moon's gravitational pull. The effects range from moving small items around, to flight, to creating havoc with the Earth's tides and earthquakes. She can also induce an effect called 'Lunar Madness' in others, which can manifest as anything from traumatic flashbacks to being driven permanently insane.

University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project

The University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project, or UMNSVP, is a team of undergraduate students from the University of Minnesota that designs and constructs solar cars. In its 24 years, it has established itself as one of the world's top solar racing teams, with top two finishes in fourteen of twenty six events entered.
History.
Beginnings.
The University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project was founded following the GM Sunrayce USA in 1990. With little to no prior knowledge, the team successfully built and raced "Aurora I" in Sunrayce `93.
"Aurora" Generation.
The "Aurora" generation of UMNSVP cars, starting with "Aurora II", mostly followed the "cutout" design that was typical of the 1990s, with a relatively flat body and a bubble canopy. Over three cars, the design was refined more and more. All three of the "Aurora" vehicles had successful trips to international races, culminating in a 4th place finish in the World Solar Challenge in Australia.
"Borealis" Generation.
The "Borealis" series of cars represents the newer generation of solar cars: exotic, aerodynamic "manta-style" bodies with unlimited array area, able to (under ideal conditions) travel as fast as, or faster than, the flow of traffic on any road. All three of the "Borealis" cars have been extremely successful.
"Centaurus" Generation.
The new "Centaurus" series of cars took the project to a whole new level by allowing the driver to sit upright while driving. Three were built in the series, and it is clear that they quickly improved to achieve the levels of success the team enjoyed with the earlier Aurora and Borealis series cars.
"Daedalus".
Daedalus is the UMNSVP's 11th generation solar car and marks a drastic design change from all of the team's previous solar cars. Designed for the new cruiser class in the World Solar Challenge, Daedalus is the team's first two-seater car and emphasizes practicality. The car incorporates padded seats, a sound system, and a Nexus 7 tablet display.
Achievements.
In more than 2 decades of competition, UMNSVP has built and raced 11 different cars, assembling one of the best records in solar car racing. In the team's history:
UMNSVP takes great pride in being one of the very few collegiate solar car teams that researches, assembles, encapsulates, and attaches its own solar array. In fact, almost everything electrical on the car is designed, built, and programmed by team members.
On July 21, 2005, during the North American Solar Challenge, "Borealis III" passed from the United States to Canada to become the first solar car to cross an international boundary during a race.
The U of M Centaurus solar car won the 2009 Formula Sun Grand Prix on June 8, 2009 completing 487 1.7 mile laps at Cresson, Texas. This was 94 laps more than the nearest competitor. It was the second straight victory for the U of M Solar car team at this event.
The future.
After completing the World Solar Challenge with Daedalus, the team is now upgrading and readying Centaurus III, now renamed Centaurus π, for the 2014 American Solar Challenge. Daedalus will go on permanent display at the PTC (software company) head office, and the team has begun design work for the next car, for now known as 'E'.
Team Composition.
Participants.
The UMNSVP team is composed exclusively of undergraduate students from the Twin Cities Campus of the University of Minnesota. Most of the participants are studying some sort of engineering in the University's College of Science and Engineering, but students of any major are welcome to join the team. The team is usually composed of 40 to 60 students.
Subteams.
The team is composed of 5 main sub-teams. Each team is responsible for designing certain components of the car, although all the systems must eventually be integrated with one another.
Administration.
In addition to the 5 sub-teams, there is also an executive team. This team composed of students from the sub-teams; it is responsible for taking on the duties of the team that are not directly associated with the vehicle, such as acquiring sponsors and setting meeting times.
As with any student group at the University of Minnesota, UMNSVP must have a faculty advisor. The faculty advisor is not directly involved with the design or construction of the car, but performs executive duties and serves as a contact to the University. The current faculty advisors for the team are Professors Philip Cohen and Paul Imbertson (Electrical and Computer Engineering). Previous faculty advisors include Prof. Jeff Hammer (Aerospace Engineering) and Dr. Patrick Starr (Mechanical Engineering).
Cars.
The University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project has built 11 cars in its history:
"Aurora I".
"Aurora I" was the first vehicle built by UMNSVP. It is arguably one of the largest solar cars ever built for a race. It served as a solid basis of knowledge with which to work on future projects.
"Aurora I" is currently in storage at Professor Marple's Farm.
"Aurora II".
"Aurora II" built heavily on the experience gained from Aurora I. It featured a complete redesign from the previous car and made the UMNSVP a permanent fixture in the world of Solar Car Raycing.
"Aurora II" is currently in storage on the University of Minnesota campus.
"Aurora3".
"Aurora³" was a redesign of "Aurora II", with a focus on improving the efficiency of the car. It featured a more aerodynamic shape and an in-wheel motor, which was a vast improvement over Aurora II's chain driven motor.
"Aurora³" is currently in storage on the University of Minnesota Campus and was displayed at the 1998 and 2006 Minnesota State Fairs.
"Aurora 4".
"Aurora 4" improved on the successes of the "Aurora" class of cars. The nickel-metal hydride battery pack was the first new battery technology used by the Minnesota team, and the solar array was the first to use two different sizes of photovoltaic solar cells. The team overcame a collision with its lead vehicle and many days of rain for a 4th place finish in Sunrayce '99. It is only the second 4-wheeled car that the UMNSVP has built to date. The original Aurora I being the first.
"Aurora 4" is currently in storage on the University of Minnesota campus.
"Borealis I".
"Borealis I" featured a major redesign from the tried-and-true cutout car. Instead of a flat shell with a "bubble" canopy, the team used an innovative "manta" shell design, where the windshield and canopy are integrated in to the body of the car. Also, nearly all other systems were redesigned for higher performance.
In early 2005, "Borealis I" was sold to the Illinois State University Solar Car Team, where it was refitted with new electronics and solar panels. ISU raced it as "Mercury I" in the 2005 North American Solar Challenge, where they finished 18th. Its chassis was re-used for their 2008 car "Mercury II", but unfortunately, troubles with their motor prevented them from qualifying. In 2009, "Mercury II" finished 5th out of 11 entered vehicles in the 2009 Formula Sun Grand Prix.
"Borealis II".
"Borealis II" improved on the design of "Borealis I", stressing first and foremost reliability, which resulted in a relatively heavy car. It overcame a number of mishaps that damaged the car to become one of UMNSVP's most successful projects to date.
"Borealis II" is currently in storage on the University of Minnesota Campus. Many of its solar cells were taken for use on "Borealis III"'s reconfigurable array.
"Borealis III".
[[Image:Borealis3windmills.jpg|thumb|200px|right|
"Borealis III" leads the way during the 2005 North American Solar Challenge, passing by Lake Benton, Minnesota.]]
"Borealis III" improved upon its predecessors by stressing efficiency and weight reduction; the car weighs just over 400 lb. "Borealis III" was also the first solar car in history to cross an international boundary during a race; it did so on July 21, 2005 during that year's North American Solar Challenge.
During June and July 2006, "Borealis III" underwent slight modifications in order to race in the World Solar Rally in Taiwan in September 2006.
"Borealis III" is currently in storage on the University of Minnesota campus.
"Centaurus I".
"Centaurus I" was the eighth solar car built by the University of Minnesota. It featured several major design adjustments from both previous series of cars. Due to a change in the North American Solar Challenge rules for 2008 requiring the driver to sit upright, the team was faced with the task of allowing the driver to do this while still minimizing aerodynamic drag. Many design components were reworked to fit the new style of vehicle and improve performance.
A video of how University of Minnesota students built Centaurus I is available on the University of Minnesota web site.
"Centaurus II".
"Centaurus II" was designed for the 2010 American Solar Challenge. Building off of experience from C1, the team managed to build a much lighter car (389 lbs empty, versus ~440 lbs for C1), as well as decrease the aerodynamic drag by a significant margin. Despite having one of the cheapest solar arrays at the event, the team managed to finish in 2nd place overall.
"Daedalus".
"Daedalus" marks a drastic design change from previous solar cars. Designed for the new cruiser class in the World Solar Challenge, it is the team's first two-seater car with an emphasis on practicality. The team overcame electrical problems to be in the minority of teams to finish the race without trailering.

Solo album

A solo album, in popular music, is an album headlined by a current or former member of a band. A solo album may feature simply one person performing all instruments, but typically features the work of other collaborators; rather, it may be made with "different" collaborators than the artist is usually associated, though just how different that group is varies widely.
The concept of the solo album arose at least as early as the late 1940s. A 1947 "Billboard" magazine article heralded "Margaret Whiting huddling with Capitol execs over her first solo album on which she will be backed by Frank De Vol".
A modern example is rock musician Sting, who came to prominence as a member of The Police. For his first solo album, 1985's "Dream of the Blue Turtles", Sting recruited an entirely different backing group with which to perform. However, it is common for musicians to recruit some of their "regular" bandmates for the recording of a solo album. Another example is the musician Peter Gabriel. Gabriel departed from the UK band Genesis with the birth of his first daughter, and wrote a song, "Solsbury Hill", to commemorate the event.
There is no formal definition setting forth the amount of participation a band member can solicit from other members of his band, and still have the album referred to as a solo album. One reviewer wrote that Ringo Starr's third venture, "Ringo", "echnically... wasn't a solo album because all four Beatles appeared on it". Three of the four members of the Beatles released solo albums while the group was officially still together, a pattern later replicated by other groups such as Kiss, who took the idea even further by releasing them on the same day and giving them similar artwork.
A performer may record a solo album for a number of reasons. A solo performer working with other members will typically have full creative control of the band, be able to hire and fire accompanists, and get the majority of the proceeds. The performer may be able to produce songs that differ widely from the sound of the band with which the performer has been associated, or that the group as a whole chose not to include in its own albums. Graham Nash, of The Hollies described his experience in developing a solo album as follows: "The thing that I go through that results in a solo album is an interesting process of collecting songs that can't be done, for whatever reason, by a lot of people". A solo album may also represent the departure of the performer from the group.

Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III

The GSLV-III or Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III is a current launch vehicle development project by the Indian Space Research Organization that got underway in the early-2000s. It is intended to launch heavy satellites into geostationary orbit, and will allow India to become less dependent on foreign rockets for heavy lifting. The GSLV MK-3 will have an India built cryogenic stage with higher capacity than GSLV MK-2 and a passive cryogenic third stage.It would also be carrying a crew module. The first experimental Mission of GSLV-Mark III is scheduled for May-June 2014 launch.
History.
Development for the GSLV Mk III began in the early 2000s,with original plan for the first launch in 2009-2010. But several factors have delayed the program, including the "failure of ISRO-developed cryogenic upper stage on April 15, 2010."
In 2007, wind tunnel tests were completed and vehicle aero-elastic tests have commenced. The vehicle configuration update was completed. All major facilities including propellant plant, vehicle assembly and integration building, mobile launch pedestal and facilities at work centers have reached the final phase of completion.
First batch of light alloy structure and motor case segments were realized at work centers. The avionics system designs have been completed and first batch of packages are being realized for qualification. Avionics assemblies layout has been finalized and integration trials for package assembly are being carried out.
A suborbital flight test of the GSLV Mk3 launcher, without its cryogenic third stage, is planned by end of 2014, and its first orbital flight will take place in 2016. ISRO would then need several more successful launches to declare the launcher safe for manned flight. First manned flight is unlikely before 2020, possibly 2–3 years later.
GSLV MK-3 first flight in 2014 would be used to test the crew module for the manned mission according to ISRO Chairman. He said "The crew module for the proposed manned mission will be flown on the Mk-III vehicle. This will be a sub-orbital flight to test the first stage and to ensure that the rocket gains five km/second velocity".
S-200 Static test.
The Solid booster S-200 was successfully tested in 24 January 2010. During the test, the S-200 booster was fired for 130 seconds and generated a peak thrust of about 500 tonnes. The performance of the booster was exactly as predicted. Nearly 600 health parameters were monitored during the test and the initial data indicates normal performance. The second successful static test of the S200 solid booster was conducted at SDSC, SHAR on September 4, 2011. Each S-200 booster given the thrust of 5151 KN at sea Level.
L-110 Static test.
Indian Space Research Organisation conducted the static test of its liquid core stage (L110) of GSLV Mk III launch vehicle, for 150 seconds at its Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) test facility at Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu at 16:00 hrs on March 5, 2010.While the test was originally targeted for 200 seconds it was stopped at 150 seconds since a deviation in one of the parameters was observed. Then on 8 September the same year ISRO successfully conducted the second static testing of L110 for 200 seconds . In future launch vehicles L110 will be replaced with ISRO's Liquid Oxygen and Kerosen engine SC2000 which gives 2000KN Thrust at Sealevel. Nearly 500 health parameters were monitored during the test and the initial data acquired indicated its normal performance.
Vehicle Description.
Stage 1 - Solid boosters.
The boosters used on the GSLV-III will be the S-200, which is also designated Large Solid Booster, or LSB. It is a solid propellant stage with a mass of 200 tonnes. Two boosters will be used. Each has a diameter of 3.2 metres and a length of 25 metres.
Stage 2 - Liquid motor.
The core stage will be the L-110 restartable liquid stage which has 110 tonnes of liquid propellant and a diameter of 4-metres. It will be the first Indian liquid engine cluster design, and will use two improved Vikas engines, each producing 75 tonnes (735 kN) of thrust. The improved Vikas engine will use regenerative cooling, providing improved weight and specific impulse, compared to earlier rockets. L110 is one of the heaviest earth storable liquid stages ever developed by ISRO.
Stage 3 - Cryogenic upper stage.
The cryogenic upper stage will be the C-25, powered by the CE-20 engine, fueled by 25 tonnes of LOX+LH2. It will be in diameter and long. The stage will produce of thrust.
This engine is slated for completion and testing by 2015, it will then be integrated with the C-25 stage and be put through a series of tests. The first C-25 stage will be used on the GSLV MK-III D-1 mission in early 2017. This mission will put in orbit the GSAT-19E communication satellite. Work on the C-25 stage and CE-20 engine for GSLV Mk-III upper stage was initiated in 2003, the project has been subject to many delays due to problems with ISRO's smaller cryogenic engine the CE-7.5 for GSLV MK-II upper stage. After completion of CE-20 engine for GSLV MK-III ISRO plans to start working on CE-60 and CE-100 cryogenic engines for future heavy lift vehicles being planned.

Markovic affair

The Markovic affair was a political scandal in France in the late 1960s, involving French President Georges Pompidou and movie star Alain Delon.
It began when one of Alain Delon’s bodyguards, Steven Markovic, was found dead, causing his brother to start a feud against Alain Delon and his friends, one of whom was the French President, Georges Pompidou. Both Delon and Marcantoni were questioned by the police immediately after the murder. Marcantoni was originally charged for the murder, but after further questioning by the police, he was released. Later, the drama continued when supposedly inappropriate photos were taken of Madame Pompidou were found. Commissionaire Aimé-Blanc, who was involved in the obtaining of the photos, stated that the photos were planted by old Gaullist clans who had long-term tension against Pompidou. This lead controversy if where the photos were real. However, the murder of Markovic was never solved. 
Life and Death of Stevan Marković.
Markovic was the ex-bodyguard of movie-star Alain Delon. He was a major gambler, but it created many enemies because of the recurring theory that he would cheat. In addition, Markovic was specially known for throwing high class parties with Delon. At these parties, it is alleged that Markovic would set up cameras throughout the house, especially in the bedrooms. He gathered plenty of questionable photos of the guests, which would damage their status in society. These photos most likely were used as blackmail, especially when he approached multiple newspapers trying to sell the photographs. Surprisingly, some of these photos were alleged to be directly targeting Delon and Marcantoni. However, the most important photos Markovic supposedly had were scandalous photos of Pompidou’s wife. This was a major concern to Pompidou since he was preparing to run for France’s president. Then on October 1, 1968, in the village of Élancourt, Yvelines, on the western outskirts of Paris, the dead body of Stevan Markovic was found in a public dump. There were plenty people who had the motive to kill him, but his murder still has not been solved.
Involving Alain Delon and François Marcantoni.
Alain Delon communicated with more gangsters, such as Z, Bimbo, and Petit René. Suspiciously, many of them met violent deaths after meeting Delon. However, François Marcantoni was Delon’s closest Corsican gangster friend. When Delon’s bodyguard, Markovic, mysteriously died, Marcantoni and Delon came under investigation. One of the factors pointing in that direction was a letter of Stevan Markovic to his brother Aleksandar where he wrote: "If I get killed, it's 100% fault of Alain Delon and his godfather Francois Marcantoni." Marcantoni was initially charged with the murder. However, after being questioned by the police, he had the charges dropped and the crime was never solved. 
Involving Georges Pompidou.
The death of Stevan Markovic provoked a lot of rumors, many suggesting the existence of group sex photos with Pompidou's wife. Pompidou was running his campaign for presidency during the time of these rumors, and wanted to put the rumors out as soon as possible. He formally told the public that all the talk concerning the Markovic affair were rumors. Pompidou himself accused Louis Wallon and Henri Capitant for using the French espionage service SDECE with an aim to set him up. He testified that he was present at parties with the wife of Pompidou, Stevan Markovic and Alain Delon. However, there are many theories that Pompidou ordered Markovic's murder for revenge against the supposedly photos of his wife. Even though he claimed the lady in the photos was a look alike prostitute to his wife, the rumors of the photos would still hurt his campaign. After becoming President of the Republic, he named Alexandre de Marenches as the head of the SDECE in order to reform it.
Madame Pompidou’s Involvement.
The Markovic affair was a play to ruin George Pompidou’s reputation by hurting the public image of his wife. There were alleged compromising photos of Madame Pompidou. Later, information shows that it was not actually Mme. Pompidou in the photos, but a prostitute that was hired by the ex-head of police Luicien Aimé-Blanc. Aimé-Blanc had long time relations with the private intelligence agency the SDECE. An anonymous friend of Amié-Blanc asked him to produce a prostitute that was blonde and in her forties, but Aimé-Blanc did not know that this women would be used as Madame Pompidou’s doppelganger. This prostitute was then photographed in compromising positions with another women. These photos were found in Markovic’s car, after his body had been found. However, no one still knows whether it was the prostitute or Madame Pompidou. 
Now.
Bernard Violet’s "Les Mystères Delon"' is a recently published book about Alain Delon. It was the first book in French legal history to have been banned before it was officially allowed to be sold, This is because Delon did not approve of this book; however, it was still sold in France. 
Delon is the only member left of the Markovic affair to be still alive.

K-12 (Kansas highway)

K-12 was a state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas, created in the mid-1980s. Its alignment was changed during its existence.
History.
K-12 was commissioned when the first section of the current K-10 freeway was completed from K-7 in Olathe, Kansas to I-435 in Lenexa, Kansas. K-10, at the time, overlapped K-7 from Olathe north to Shawnee Mission Parkway. 
When the K-10 freeway segment from Lawrence to Olathe was completed, K-10 was signed for the entire length (both sections) of the expressway, and K-12 was displaced.
When K-10 was designated on the expressway between Lawrence and Lenexa, K-12 was realigned north to take the place of the former K-10 alignment. It followed Shawnee Mission Parkway from K-7 in Shawnee, Kansas. It turned north on Merriam Drive in Merriam, Kansas, which follows into Kansas City, Kansas. Merriam Lane turns into Southwest Blvd. near US-169, and K-12 ended not far east at the Missouri state line.
Since K-12 existed entirely within the city limits of the cities it traverses, it was turned back to the cities in 1987 according to KDOT policy.

Righteous indignation

Righteous indignation is typically a reactive emotion of anger over perceived mistreatment, insult, or malice. It is akin to what is called the sense of injustice. In some Christian doctrines, righteous indignation is considered the only form of anger which is not sinful, e.g., when Jesus drove the money lenders out of the temple (Gospel of Matthew 21).
Elements.
Righteous means acting in accord with divine or moral law or free from guilt or sin. It may also refer to a morally right or justifiable decision or action or to an action which arises from an outraged sense of justice or morality. "Indignation" is anger aroused by something unjust, mean, or unworthy. The "Standard Dictionary" describes indignation as a "feeling involving anger mingled with contempt or disgust".
Daniel Whitby argues that "Anger is not always sinful", in that it is found among non-sinners. For example, Jesus was "angry with the Pharisees for the hardness of their hearts; yet He had no desire to revenge this sin upon them, but had a great compassion for them". In Scott's comment on Ephesians 4:26, he notes that "...on many occasions, in the management of families, in reproving sin, and even in ordering their temporal concerns", anger is permitted of Christians. Nevertheless, Scott cautions that Christians should aim to "...be very circumspect and vigilant to restrain that dangerous passion within the bounds of reason, meekness, piety, and charity; not being angry without cause, or above cause, or in a proud, selfish, and peevish manner." In contrast with some commentators who argue that righteous indignation may be a permissible form of anger within the Christian religion, Scott argues that Christians should not express anger in the "language of vehement indignation".
The "Forerunner Commentary" on Psalms 137:2 argues that these psalms are about the "bitterness of exile into which God forced Judah", purportedly with the goal of turning grief into zeal, so that the "anger can be used to scour away sin" by becoming "righteously indignant". In Richard T. Ritenbaugh's comments on Proverbs 15:18 in How to Survive Exile, he argues that it "is alright for us to be righteously indignant as long as we do not sin." In McCosh's book "Motive Powers", he notes that "We may be angry and sin not; but this disposition may become sinful, and this in the highest degree. It is so when it is excessive, when it is rage, and makes us lose control of ourselves. It is so, and may become a vice, when it leads us to wish evil to those who have offended us. It is resentment when it prompts us to meet and repay evil by evil. It is vengeance when it impels us to crush those who have injured us. It is vindictiveness when it is seeking out ingeniously and laboriously means and instruments to give pain to those who have thwarted us. Already sin has entered."

Covenant Bible College

Covenant Bible College or Covenant Bible College Canada, CBC-Canada, or CBC as it was most commonly referred to was a vocational/Bible college was located in Strathmore, Alberta where the last campus was held. It closed in 2007.
History.
Roots.
CBC-Canada begin in 1941 in Norquay, Saskatchewan under the name Covenant Bible Institute. The idea of this institute/college would come out of the Canada Conference of the Evangelical Covenant Church. Originally it was a three year course, but by 1957 it became a two year course, and in 1962 CBI (Covenant Bible Institute) was condensed into a one year program. During its first 50 years, CBI/CBC was led by Joel Peterson and Wendell Anderson. During that time, the class size would range anywhere from 25-45 students with the central focus being the equipping young adults to serve the church as Biblically literate and spiritually formed lay persons.
Prince Albert, Saskatchewan campus.
Covenant Bible College relocated to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan in 1944. It remained in Prince Albert until it moved to Strathmore in 1995.
Strathmore, Alberta campus.
Strathmore, Alberta is located 30 minutes east of Calgary. With a population of about 9,500, offering students a small town atmosphere. The campus is situated on of land. CBC-Canada offers students four dorms that house 22 students each. Each dorm contains single and double rooms, plenty of space to lounge about, a games room, laundry room, and kitchen. For easier access, the dorms are connected to the building for convenience during the winter months. The campus also has an administration building with classrooms, library, cafeteria and a full size gym with hardwood floor.
Events.
Each year CBC-Canada held several events. Many of the events are geared towards youth of junior and senior high school ages.
Extreme Impact.
Extreme Impact, or just Extreme as it was commonly called, was a weekend youth conference held in March. It was planned and organized by each year's class as part of the campus commitment to providing opportunities in ministry. Students received the opportunity to serve in the name of Jesus. The students also had the chance to uncover and utilize the many gifts they possess, while at the same time, leading younger students and youth leaders in a weekend of worship and discipleship.
Jr. Hi Jam.
Jr. Hi Jam was a weekend youth conference held during the May long weekend, targeted towards junior high students from grades 7-9.
Closure.
After 66 years in operation Covenant Bible College ceased operations. The cause of the closure was declining enrollment and donations. The former CBC campus was sold for $5.5 million. It was sold to another Christian organization EnCharis.

LynnMall

LynnMall is a shopping centre in New Lynn, a suburb of Waitakere City, New Zealand, on Great North Road adjacent to New Lynn Train Station, southwest of the Auckland CBD.
History.
LynnMall was opened on 29 October 1963, having cost £500,000 ($1 million) to build. The development began in 1961 when Hammerson Property and Investment Trust of London bought 2.8ha of land fronting Great North Road from the Auckland Bus Company. The designers of the mall - the first in the country - were Walker, Lewis and Hillary & Co of Auckland. In March 1999, architects Hames Sharley undertook significant work to upgrade the shopping centre.
In a 2008 rating of New Zealand shopping centres by a retail expert group, LynnMall received just two out of four stars, the lowest rating in the country (though not the lowest that would have been possible) based on the criteria of amount of shopping area, economic performance, amenity and appeal as well as future growth prospects. The reviewers considered that the look and feel of the centre had been allowed to deteriorate and that the centre would need substantial investment before being able to recover its true potential. A spokesperson for the centre's operator, AMP, disagreed and noted that the centre had more sales per square metre than other centres and had recently been refurbished.
In December 2010 Kiwi Income Property Trust purchased the mall from AMP for $174m.
Events.
On 9 October 2006, two Chubb Corp. security guards were held up at gunpoint by two persons demanding cash as they returned to their armoured car after leaving ASB Bank. The persons absconded with an undetermined quantity of cash after firing several shots, nobody was injured during the event.

Ronnie Ronalde

Ronnie Ronalde (born Ronald Charles Waldron, 1923, London) is a British music hall singer and siffleur. Ronalde is famous for his voice, whistling, yodelling, imitations of bird song and stage personality. His crystal clear yodelling gained him acceptance with connoisseurs of Alpine and Western music around the world.
Biography.
Early life: the Silver Songsters.
Ronalde grew up in a poor but supportive Islington home, and found a talent for singing, whistling and bird impressions from early childhood. In these formative years, he entertained informally for pocket money, or with church and school choirs, developing his talents for stage performance.
During a time in which he was training for accountancy, Ronalde was invited to become one of Arturo Steffani's Silver Songsters, aged 15. This 21-piece boys’ choir was known for its complex vocal and visual arrangements of popular songs, with each boy usually going into other trades when older. Steffani was so taken with Ronalde’s voice and whistling (he referred to him as “the Pink of Perfection”), that he disbanded the Silver Songsters (in 1947) and became his personal manager, mentor and chaperone. They later toured all over the world together. 
After wartime service, Steffani encouraged Ronalde to study singing in London and yodelling in Switzerland, and for nearly a decade he began working his way up the bill, not only as a solo Variety performer, but also under his new name: Ronnie Ronalde.
1950s: the halcyon years.
After early struggles, Ronalde's first successful UK tour (in the late 1940s) met him with a wave of interest. Ronalde’s first recordings were with Decca Records (these were only to be whistling performances), but his first major label contract came from EMI. Ronalde would also join Pye, Major Minor and Columbia records, becoming a million selling artiste.
“If I Were a Blackbird” (1950) is among Ronalde’s most famous songs from this period. This rendering of Delia Murphy’s Irish folk song had him in the British top 20 for 6 months. She would later jovially express her thanks for boosting her income. Other songs include “Tritsch Tratsch Polka” (a showcase of Ronalde’s high speed delivery whistling) and “Bells Across the Meadow” (by Albert Ketèlbey). His best known recording is “In a Monastery Garden” (by Albert Ketèlbey). Ronnie has played it as his show finale for decades, and over a million copies of it have been sold in their varying formats.
Across this decade Ronalde was a headliner, and broke box office records all over the world: he was a big name in the UK, US, Australasia, Scandinavia, Africa, South America and Europe. Such was his success in the US in the 1950s, he was seen as serious competition to Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby, and others such as Richard Tauber and Josef Locke.
Ronalde had his own BBC Radio Show from 1949 called "The Voice of Variety". During this series, the volume of Ronalde’s fan mail caused a problem for the BBC. The "Voice of Variety News" fan publication had a print of 55,000 copies twice yearly, and Fan Clubs during this era existed all across the UK. Thames TV also presented a weekly show titled "Meet Ronnie Ronalde".
In 1949 Ronalde filled Radio City Music Hall in New York City (with capacity of over six thousand) every night for ten weeks. He was at that time the most frequent UK artiste to ever perform there (over a thousand times). During the same period he filled a 25,000 capacity venue in Toronto Canada for a fortnight. In February 1956, the British music magazine, "NME", reported that Billy Cotton and Ronalde had released versions of "Happy Trails", the theme music to ATV's weekly "Roy Rogers" series.
Ronalde also performed for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at the Royal Command Performance at the London Coliseum. A Daily Express reporter commented on the Prince’s attempts to demonstrate whistling to the Queen after this performance. He appeared before Prince Philip again.
Later life.
At the height of his popularity, Ronalde foresaw a decline in variety performing and took a step away from the limelight. Nonetheless, Ronalde did not abandon the entertainment industry: he has always maintained an engagement diary and summer seasons, as well as TV and radio appearances. He first settled on the island of Guernsey in the 1960s, being attracted to it after a performance there. He purchased a hotel (St Martin’s, which would come to be known as Ronnie Ronalde’s Hotel), and met Austrian wife Rosemarie who would become his business manager after Steffani’s death. After raising three children, both he and Rosemarie moved to the Isle of Man in the late 1980s, then to New Zealand in the 1990s (to Whistler’s Lodge). He now lives in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.
Despite his age, he still broadcasts and performs in concerts. In New Zealand in 1990, Ronalde filled the 2500-capacity Aotea Theatre, and was asked to stay for another concert. He was also asked to return for repeat performances in Auckland's Town Hall and the Town Hall in Christchurch.
Ronalde was awarded America’s North Carolina Louisburg Hall of Fame Award in 1995, their highest acclaim, given only to artists of outstanding international distinction.
His recording “Bird Song at Eventide” was featured in the hit TV series, and subsequent best-selling soundtrack, "The Singing Detective" in 1986.
His 1998 autobiography entitled "Around the World on a Whistle" drew extensively on memorabilia, theatre bills, photographs and clippings, and is a document of the published history of variety circuits. His next book, he has quipped, will be “an Encyclopaedia of Whistling”.
EMI Australia released a CD with the same title ("Around the World on a Whistle") in the 1990s. In testament to the longevity of his popularity, this gained him another Gold Disc and a small upsurge in his career. Since "Around the World" EMI have released a number of albums of Ronalde’s early works that have not been available since their original gramophone releases.
Ronalde appeared in the 2007 Australian feature film, "Clubland".
Ronalde made an appearance at the Hackney Empire for a charity evening, The Golden Years of Variety, on Sunday 9 September 2012, when he received a standing ovation.
He suffered a stroke shortly after his 90th birthday in 2013, and subsequently moved into Brinsworth House, the retired entertainers' home in Twickenham.
The comedians Bob Hope, Jimmy Edwards, Morecambe and Wise, Bob Monkhouse, Peter Cook, Max Wall and Max Bygraves have all made references to ‘Whistling Ronnie’ in their routines. Terry-Thomas joked that he was sick of hearing Ronalde’s whistling, and attempted impersonations.

Song meaning.
According to Sully Erna, the song is about how every time he tours to New Orleans with Godsmack, he gets sick. Sully attributes this to having been killed in New Orleans in a previous life and being haunted by "evil spirits" every time he visits New Orleans.
Versions.
There are two versions of "Re-Align". The original version appeared on Godsmack's third studio album, "Faceless". The second version, which is an acoustic recording, appeared on "The Other Side" EP. Although the two versions have a similar sound, the acoustic version runs for 4:23, three seconds longer than the original version. The acoustic version is, naturally, a bit softer.

Dioscorea bulbifera

Dioscorea bulbifera, the air potato, is a true yam species in the Dioscoreaceae, or true yam family. It is known as varahi in Sanskrit, kaachil in Malayalam and dukkar kand in Marathi. It is native to Africa and Asia. It is an invasive species in many tropical areas, including Florida in the United States.
Description.
"Dioscorea bulbifera" is a perennial vine with broad leaves and two types of storage organs. The plant forms bulbils in the leaf axils of the twining stems, and tubers beneath the ground. These tubers are like small, oblong potatoes. Some varieties are edible and cultivated as a food crop, especially in West Africa. The tubers of edible varieties often have a bitter taste, which can be removed by boiling. They can then be prepared in the same way as other yams, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. The air potato is one of the most widely-consumed yam species. It can grow up to 150 feet tall.
Air potato can grow extremely quickly, roughly 8 inches per day, and eventually reach over 60 feet long. It typically climbs to the tops of trees and has a tendency to take over native plants. New plants develop from bulbils that form on the plant, and these bulbils serve as a means of dispersal. The aerial stems of air potato die back in winter, but resprouting occurs from bulbils and underground tubers. The primary means of spread and reproduction are via bulbils. The smallest bulbils make control of air potato difficult due to their ability to sprout at a very small stage. The vine produces small white flowers, however these are rarely seen when it grows in Florida. The fruits are capsules.
Uses.
Air potato has been used as a folk remedy to treat conjunctivitis, diarrhea and dysentery, among other ailments.
Toxicity.
Uncultivated forms, such as those found growing wild in Florida can be poisonous. These varieties contain the steroid, diosgenin, which is a principal material used in the manufacture of a number of synthetic steroidal hormones, such as those used in hormonal contraception. There have been claims that even the wild forms are rendered edible after drying and boiling, leading to confusion over actual toxicity.
Invasive species.
In some places, such as Florida, it is considered a noxious weed because of its quick-growing, large-leafed vine that spreads tenaciously and shades out any plants growing beneath it. The bulbils on the vines sprout and become new vines, twisting around each other to form a thick mat. If the plant is cut to the ground, the tubers can survive for extended periods and send up new shoots later.
The leaf beetle "Lilioceris cheni" has been studied and employed as an agent of biological pest control for the plant.

Canon L lens

Canon's series of L lenses are a professional line of SLR photography lenses made by Canon. Canon produces both L-series zoom and prime lenses for their past FD lens mount and for their current EF lens mount used on all Canon EOS cameras (digital and film). They are notable for their superior image quality and robust design.
Characteristics.
Most L series lenses share a number of common characteristics not found in Canon's line of lower-end lenses. L lenses tend to be more durable, incorporating dust-resistant and water-resistant rubber seals on some models. L lenses also contain optics of higher quality, with many lenses containing fluorite or ultra-low dispersion glass elements, ground aspherically. Their front elements do not rotate for the proper operation of some filters, such as circular polarizers. L lenses are often "fast," with wider apertures than comparable lower-end Canon optics. All contain an ultrasonic motor and extra communication pins.
Larger sized L-lenses, such as the 70–200 mm and 100–400 mm zooms and longer focal length primes (300 mm+), usually have an off-white barrel (sometimes referred to as the color "putty") to reduce heat absorption under the sun that may otherwise affect the performance of the lens, as well as to identify Canon's lenses (for example at sporting events), though these can be confused with Sony A and Pentax K-mount lenses which are also offered in (pure) white. However, shorter focal length L-lenses can be black (such as the Canon EF 24–70 mm f/2.8L and all L-lens primes under 300 mm, with the exception of the discontinued 200 mm f/1.8L and current 200 mm f/2.0L IS). Therefore L-lenses can be identified by either a lens barrel's off-white colour or, as on all L-lenses, the distinctive red ring on the lens barrel.
Wide angle L-lenses typically have a gelatin filter holder on the mounting point of the lens, which allows the photographer to cut a small, square piece of gelatin out of a larger filter sheet and place it on the lens. On film cameras, these are typically used to correct the color temperature, but on digital cameras this is largely unnecessary, as the color temperature can be corrected in software. The mount is still commonly used for neutral density gelatin sheets though, especially on certain wide-angle lenses where the protruding front element precludes the use of any screw-in filters. Some telephoto L-lenses, such as the EF 70-200mm zoom lenses, or the EF 300mm f/4L IS USM do not have rear gelatin filter holders. Super-telephoto lenses such as the EF 500mm f/4L IS USM, or the EF 200mm f/2L IS USM do have a rear 52mm drop-in filter holder, than can be used to hold gelatin type filters.
Lenses.
The following is a list of EF mount L-lenses, including discontinued lenses.
Canon lens codes.
On the back of Canon lenses is a six-digit code, which indicates where the lens was manufactured and when.
"Example of a code "UV1212""
The first letter 'U' represents the factory that made the lens. Three possible first letters are:
The second letter 'V' represent the year of manufacture 
The next two digits represent the month of the lens is manufactured.
The last two digits are for internal Canon use.
Therefore the example ("pictured") of "UV0512" means the lens was made in the Utsunomiya, Japan factory in May 2007.

Massachusetts v. Laird, 400 U.S. 886 (1970), was a case dealing with the conscription aspect of the Vietnam War that the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear by a 6-3 vote.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts challenged the constitutionality of the war. It passed a law stating that no resident of Massachusetts "shall be required to serve" in the military abroad if the armed hostility has not been declared a war by Congress. The attorney general of Massachusetts asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its case to test the legality of the Vietnam War.

The Girl, the Gold Watch &amp; Everything

The Girl, the Gold Watch & Everything (1962) is a science fiction novel written by John D. MacDonald.
Plot synopsis.
The protagonist, Kirby Winter, is a young man living in Florida, full of anxiety and feeling no confidence in his ability to face life, either professionally (he had in fact not chosen a clear profession) or sexually (all his encounters with women, since puberty, ended disastrously).
Kirby's life had been overshadowed by an uncle who had been a mathematics teacher and suddenly developed an uncanny talent for gambling, broke several casinos and made himself a millionaire. The uncle seemed disappointed with Kirby's inability to make something of himself. At his death it turns out he had left Kirby none of his wealth – nothing but an antique gold pocket watch to which a toy telescope is attached, showing a pornographic picture.
An older woman, quite attractive, shows up and makes clear her interest in Kirby. He is attracted to her but feels too insecure to respond to her attempts at seduction – which turns out to be fortunate, as she is a hardened and ruthless criminal, who had been his uncle's arch-enemy. The uncle many times thwarted the plots of her and her male partner, got away with quite a bit of their ill-gained money and avoided with contemptuous ease all that they tried to do against him. Her interest in the nephew derives from the vain hope of learning the uncle's secret (of which Kirby still has no idea).
Kirby's luck turns when he sleeps in the bed of a friend of a friend who is away for the weekend. In the middle of the night, a naked young woman gets into the bed and makes love to him in the dark, mistaking him for the bed's usual occupant. Caught in the middle of sleep, all of Kirby's sexual hang-ups disappear and he performs quite well. Discovering her mistake, the woman – named Bonnie Lee Beaumont – is at first furious but within minutes the two of them fall deeply and enduringly in love with each other and consummate their new-found love for the rest of the night.
On the following day, spent on the seashore, Kirby plays with the watch and accidentally finds out his uncle's secret: the watch can stop time for everybody but the holder, leaving him in a peculiar red-lighted world with everybody around "frozen", and effectively placing everybody else in the world at his mercy. Kirby and his newly found girlfriend only use this awesome power for relatively innocuous practical jokes such as completely undressing women who "tease men by wearing very small bikinis" and laughing to see them escape in panic.
The woman criminal, who meanwhile discovered the watch's secret, has far more sinister plans for its use, and succeeds in capturing Kirby, who comes near to being killed - but he manages to turn the tables on her with the help of the watch. He can quite easily use the watch's power to kill her, but decides that using it to kill anybody - even those who deserve it - would "take away the fun"; he settles instead for stripping her and putting her in a truckload of Navy sailors, with the resulting experience causing her to lose interest in the watch (and everything else) in favor of sexual trysts with sailors.
In the aftermath, Kirby Winter and Bonnie Lee Beaumont live happily ever after – joining the world's jet set, living in riotous luxury, traveling from one resort to another, gambling at casinos and (naturally) always winning, and responding to constant attacks by dangerous gangsters by perpetrating ever-funnier practical jokes on the hapless gangsters.
Commentaries.
A back-cover blurb that describes the novel as similar to a collaboration between Thorne Smith and Mickey Spillane appeared on the book's first 13 printings (through October 1979). Thorne Smith's humorous supernatural fantasy novels, such as "Topper" (1926), are classics of this genre, while Mickey Spillane's writings are typically hardboiled crime fiction.
It is possible that the given name of MacDonald's protagonist (Kirby Winter) was inspired by the surname of one of Smith's lead characters in "Topper" (George Kerby).
Publishing history.
The first printing of this book was as a paperback original:
This book has appeared in at least 24 printings in the United States through June 1991 and, with MacDonald's two other science fiction novels, "Wine of the Dreamers" (1951) and "Ballroom of the Skies" (1952), was collected as part of an omnibus in "Time and Tomorrow" (1980).
A second comma was added to the title (after "Watch") with the 2nd printing, and dropped again with the 14th printing.
The only English-language printing that used "and" instead of an ampersand (&) was the Coronet Books printing published by Hodder Fawcett Ltd. in the United Kingdom (1968).
In addition, the book has appeared in at least one Canadian printing (1964) and four British printings (1964, ca. 1965, 1968, and 1974). The latter book was the first hardcover appearance of the novel.
"The Girl, the Gold Watch & Everything" has been translated into at least six languages and published in Brazil, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, and Russia.
Adaptations.
The novel was adapted directly as a TV movie starring Robert Hays and Pam Dawber, "The Girl, the Gold Watch and Everything" (1980). The title song was released as a 45-rpm record by Richie Havens on the Elektra label.
The TV movie was successful enough to inspire a sequel based on the original characters, "The Girl, the Gold Watch and Dynamite" (1981).
Parodies, pastiches, and allusions.
A similar plot line - a man stopping time - already appeared in 1955 in Roger Lee Vernon's story "The Stop Watch", included in the collection "The Space Frontiers". Vernon treated the theme far more seriously, with his protagonist using the device to commit crimes with impunity and win the Third World War all by himself, and finally suffering a terrible perdition.
MacDonald's plot device, the watch that stopped time, was incorporated into "Lady Slings the Booze" (1992) by Spider Robinson, who included John D. MacDonald in his acknowledgments.
The title was parodied—apparently with the permission of Gold Medal Books—in "The Girls, the Massage, & Everything" (1973) by Bernhardt J. Hurwood.
Several additional parodies and pastiches of the original plot device are identified in the article on "A Kind of a Stopwatch."
Stephen King often alludes to the title in his time-travel novel, "11-22-63".

Onium compound

In chemistry, an onium compound, or onium ion, is a cation formally obtained by the protonation of mononuclear parent hydride of a pnictogen (group 15 of the periodic table), chalcogen (group 16), or halogen (group 17). The oldest-known onium ion, and the namesake for the class, is ammonium, , the protonated derivative of ammonia, .
The name onium is also used for cations that would result from the substitution of hydrogen atoms in those ions by other groups, such as organic radicals, or halogens; such as tetraphenylphosphonium, . The substituent groups may be di- or trivalent, yielding ions such as iminium and nitrilium.
Onium ions have a charge of +1. A molecule with two or more onium ion subgroups is said to be a double onium ion, triple onium ion, and so on. Compounds of an onium cation and some other negative ion are known as onium salts.
Onium compounds are inversely analogous to ate complexes.
Lewis bases form onium ions when the central atom gains one more bond and becomes a positive cation.
Lewis acids form -ate ions when the central atom gains one more bond and becomes a negative anion.

Mateo Flores

Mateo Flores, born Doroteo Guamuch Flores (February 11, 1922 – August 11, 2011), was a Guatemalan long-distance runner who won several international events, including the Boston Marathon in 1952.
Career.
Flores was born in Cotió, Mixco, a town near Guatemala City. During his early athletic career, Flores worked in as a low-paid laborer in a textile factory. He would wake at 4:00 am to run for two hours, and run an additional two hours after returning from work at 6:00 pm.
Flores' career spanned from 1941 to 1957; prior to winning the 1952 Boston Marathon, he was the winner of multiple international races, notably the marathon at the 1946 Barranquilla Games, the half marathon at the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games in Guatemala, and the marathon at the 1955 Pan American Games in Mexico City. He also participated in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.
1952 Boston Marathon.
On April 19, 1952, Flores participated in the Boston Marathon, a major international racing event. He took the lead from his countryman Luis H. Velasquez after the first ten miles, and, against any predictions, finished ahead of U.S. competitor Victor Dyrgall by almost five minutes, recording a time of 2 hours, 31 minutes, and 53 seconds.His record remained as a national record for Guatemala for seventeen years, until November 5, 1969, when it was broken by Julio Quevedo.
Honors and Awards.
The Boston achievement made Flores a sports icon in his country, and the Guatemalan government paid him tribute by renaming the national stadium in Guatemala City to "Estadio Nacional Mateo Flores". He was treated as a national hero by the Guatemalan government, which also awarded him the Order of the Quetzal (the nation's highest civilian honor).
Life after retirement.
Flores became a Professor of physical education after his retirement. He has also been a golf caddy working at the Guatemala Country Club and occasional player. He was a practicing Roman Catholic.

Butriptyline

Butriptyline (Evadene, Evadyne, Evasidol, Centrolese) is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) which has been used in Europe since 1974. It is the isobutyl side chain homologue of amitriptyline and produces similar effects to it, but with less marked side effects like sedation and interactions with adrenergic drugs.
"In vitro", butriptyline is a strong antihistamine and anticholinergic, moderate 5-HT2 and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor, with negligible affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters. These actions appear to confer a profile similar to that of iprindole and trimipramine with serotonin-blocking effects as the predominant mediator of mood-lifting efficacy.
However, in clinical trials, using similar doses, butriptyline was found to be even more effective than amitriptyline as an antidepressant, despite the fact that amitriptyline is much, much stronger as both a 5-HT2 antagonist and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. As a result, it can be inferred that butriptyline, "in vivo", may function as a prodrug to a metabolite with more appreciable pharmacodynamics.

Phosphorylcholine

Phosphorylcholine is the hydrophilic polar head group of some phospholipids, which is composed of a negatively
charged phosphate bonded to a small, positively charged choline group. Phosphorylcholine is part of platelet-activating factor; the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine as well as sphingomyelin, the only phospholipid of the membrane that is not built with a glycerol backbone. Treatment of cell membranes, like those of RBCs, by certain enzymes, like some phospholipase A2 renders the phosphorylcholine moiety exposed to the external aqueous phase, and thus accessible for recognition by the immune system. Antibodies against phosphorylcholine are naturally occurring autoantibodies that are created by CD5+/B-1 B cells and are referred to as non-pathogenic autoantibodies.
Thrombus-resistant stents.
In the field of interventional cardiology, phosphorylcholine is used as a synthetic polymer based coating, applied to drug-eluting stents, to prevent the occurrence of coronary artery restenosis. The first application of this approach for use on stents evolved from efforts by Hayward and Chapman et al., who demonstrated that the phosphorylcholine component of the outer surface of the erythrocyte bilayer was non-thrombogenic. To date, more than 120,000 Phosphorylcholine-coated stents have been implanted in patients with no apparent deleterious effect in the long term compared to bare metal stent technologies.
Phosphorylcholine polymer-based drug-eluting stents.
Drug-eluting stents (DES) are used by interventional cardiologists, operating on patients with coronary artery disease. The stent is inserted into the artery via a balloon angioplasty. This will dilate the diameter of the coronary artery and keep it fixed in this phase so that more blood flows through the artery without the risk of blood clots (atherosclerosis). Phosphorylcholine is used as the polymer based coating of a DES because its molecular design improves surface biocompatibility and lowers the risk of causing inflammation or thrombosis. Polymer coatings of stents that deliver the anti-proliferative drug Zotarolimus to the arterial vessel wall are key components of these revolutionary medical devices. For targeted local delivery of Zotarolimus to the artery, the drug is incorporated into a methacrylate-based copolymer that includes a synthetic form of phosphorylcholine. This use of biomimicry, or the practice of using polymers that occur naturally in biology, provides a coating, with minimal thrombus deposition and no adverse clinical effect on late healing of the arterial vessel wall. Not only is the coating non-thrombogenic, but it also exhibits other features that should be present when applying such a material to a medical device for long-term implantation. These include durability, neutrality to the chemistry of the incorporated drug and ability for sterilization using standard methods which do not affect drug structure or efficacy.

Moscow, Camden and San Augustine Railroad

The Moscow, Camden & San Augustine Railroad Company is a Class III short line railroad headquartered in Camden, Texas. It is a subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific.
The MCSA operates a 6.9 mi (11.1 km) line from Camden to an interchange with the Union Pacific Railroad in Moscow, Texas. Although it is legally a common carrier, the line’s traffic consists entirely of outbound plywood, lumber, and other forest products originating from a single industry, the Georgia-Pacific mill in Camden.
Despite its diminutive length, the MCSA holds several Texas historical distinctions. It is the oldest railroad in Texas still operating under its original charter. It was among the last railroads in Texas to operate regular revenue trains using steam locomotives and to operate regularly scheduled passenger train service.
History.
The MCSA was chartered in June 1898 to build a line from Moscow to San Augustine, Texas by way of Camden, primarily to move products from a new W.T. Carter & Brother Lumber Company sawmill in Camden to the Houston East & West Texas Railway main line in Moscow. The lumber company’s owners provided the financing and owned most of the new railroad’s stock. The line from Moscow to Camden was completed on November 19, 1898 and was never extended to San Augustine.
At Camden, the MCSA connected to an extensive network of private W.T. Carter Company rail lines that were used to transport freshly cut timber from remote logging camps to the sawmill. Starting in the 1940s, these rail lines were gradually phased out as the lumber company made increasing use of trucks for timber extraction. Since the lumber company owned both rail operations, this process made plenty of surplus W.T. Carter steam locomotives available for use by the MCSA, delaying the onset of dieselization. The MCSA would not obtain its first diesel-electric locomotive until 1960 and still used steam power until 1965, one of the last common-carrier railroads in Texas to do so.
In 1968, the W.T. Carter & Bro. Lumber Company and the MCSA were purchased by Champion International. In 2000, both companies were acquired by International Paper. Georgia Pacific acquired all assets from International Paper (Mill and Railroad) in April 2007 and is the current owner.
Passenger train service.
When MCSA operations began in 1898, Texas law required railroads to operate passenger service in order to claim common carrier status. In 1927, the railroad's original passenger car was replaced by a wood combine car built in 1898 for the Long Island Rail Road. It would be the last passenger car ever owned by the MCSA.
In its early years, the railroad provided a vital link to the outside world for the residents of Camden. Ridership declined sharply in the 1930s as highways were constructed in the area and automobiles and buses became more popular. However, passenger service remained profitable enough to justify its continuation. In the 1950s, its popularity increased as tourists and railfans became attracted to the pleasant East Texas forest scenery, the old-fashioned wood combine, the rustic wooden train station at Camden, and the steam locomotives. Other attractions in Camden included the quaint, old-fashioned company store and the “Locomotive Graveyard”, a portion of the railroad yard where a number of old MCSA and W.T. Carter steam locomotives had been left to decay in the elements.
In the 1960s and early 1970s, passenger service remained popular despite dieselization of the MCSA and discontinuation of regular connecting passenger service by the Southern Pacific Railroad at Moscow. After the line was purchased by Champion International, the new owners became concerned about the possibility of civil liability in the event of an accident, especially given the age of the railroad’s 1898 wood combine. Passenger service was finally discontinued in July 1973.

West Coast Railway (Victoria)

West Coast Railway was the trading name of The Victorian Railway Company Pty Ltd, a railway company operating in Victoria, Australia. The company operated passenger services between Melbourne and Warrnambool from September 1993 until August 2004.
History.
West Coast Railway was formed in 1993 when the Kennett State Government offered long-distance country rail services previously run by the government-owned operator V/Line to private operators. Bids were lodged in February 1993 and West Coast Railway was announced as the successful tender on 30 April the same year. The initial franchise was for eight years with operations commencing on 19 September 1993. Subsequently a three extension was negotiated.
While most other rail services tendered were replaced by road coach services, West Coast Railway successfully tendered to retain a rail service. During the 11 years of WCR operation of the line, patronage increased by 20%. The first rail service under WCR operated on 19 September when V/Line locomotive N466 "City of Warrnambool" hauled the 17:00 Warrnambool to Melbourne Spencer Street service.
In 2001 the two directors of the company bought a 50% share in Tranz Scenic, the national passenger operator in New Zealand. In May 2004 the shareholding was sold back to Toll NZ.
Rolling stock.
West Coast Railway operated rolling stock notable for being largely made up of 1950s locomotives and rolling stock bought from V/Line, replacing the 1980s-built locomotives and rolling stock that had previously operated on the line. This was in contrast to the successful tenderer for the Shepparton line rail service from Hoys Roadlines, who decided to lease rolling stock from V/Line.
The locomotives purchased from V/Line were:
The carriages purchased were S and Z type steel-bodied passenger carriages built between 1937 and 1959. 
A blue, white, yellow and grey livery was adopted.
The first locomotive to be fully overhauled by was S300 which begun trials on 23 January 1995, entering regular service two weeks later. 
The railway depot at Ballarat East was leased by the company as its heavy maintenance base, with transfer runs being made via the Geelong to Ballarat line.
Specially modified R class steam locomotives were also used to operate a Saturday return service, becoming the fastest regular steam hauled passenger service in the world. R711 entered service on regular trains on 21 November 1998 and was fitted with multiple unit control equipment for diesel electric locomotives.
As well as operating regular Warrnambool passenger services, West Coast Railway also ran charter services and operated special excursion trains to various destinations within Victoria, often in conjunction with The South Western Railway Society. The company assisted with the restoration of a number of steam locomotives, with R711 and Y112 made operational, and work being carried out on J536, D3 638, D3 641, and A2 986.
The company also took advantage of Victoria's newly privatised rail freight market by hiring its T class locomotives and occasionally its mainline fleet of B class and S class, to freight operators.
Demise.
West Coast Railway encountered a series of operational difficulties during 2003–04 which adversely affected its business. 
The death of one of the company's founding principals, Gary McDonald, on 25 April 2003 removed the guiding light and spirit of the company. The closure of the Warrnambool line between Melbourne and Geelong for five weeks in January and February 2004, to allow its rebuilding as part of the 160 km/h (100 mph) Regional Fast Rail project, meant that the company had to replace rail services with road coaches during the period of the works, with a resulting drop in passenger numbers.
In May 2004 only a short time after West Coast Railway's rail services resumed in March, the Victorian Department of Infrastructure issued an alert on stress cracks on the underframes of the B class and S class locomotives, including the units owned by West Coast Railway. Once again the company was forced to replace two of its three daily-return rail services with road coaches.
There had also been a change in government transport policy following the election of the Bracks State Government following the failure of privatisation of V/Line Passenger, with then Opposition transport spokesman Geoff Leigh predicting the proposed re-tendering of statewide regional rail operations in 2006 would result in West Coast Railway being "executed". 
Although West Coast Railway stated as late as May 2004 its intention to negotiate a new contract to operate Warrnambool services beyond the expiry of its existing contract in June 2004, with the expected locomotive repair bill to be in excess of A$1,000,000 it decided not to seek a renewal. On 31 August 2004 West Coast Railway operated its final services with V/Line resuming services the following day.
The diesel locomotives were sold to Chicago Freight Car Leasing Australia with all operational as at January 2013. R711 was allocated to Steamrail Victoria by its owners.

Blackbeard's Castle

Blackbeard's Castle is one of five National Historic Landmarks in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is located in the city of Charlotte Amalie, on the island of St. Thomas. Built in 1679 by the Danes as a watchtower to protect the harbor as well as Fort Christian. Blackbeard's Castle was originally called Skytsborg Tower (meaning sky tower). It is located at the highest point on Government Hill. Skytsborg Tower served as a very effective vantage point for Danish soldiers to spot enemy ships. Fort Christian is at sea level, thus making it ideal for thwarting attackers with cannon fire; however, the fort itself did not provide an ideal view of incoming ships entering the harbor. 
It is not known what year Skytsborg Tower took on the name of Blackbeard's Castle, but the infamous Edward Teach, commonly known as Blackbeard, did sail the Caribbean waters in the early 18th century. It has become part of the lore of the island that he used the tower as a lookout for his own purposes of piracy. It was the centerpiece of a private residence for many years, but now is surrounded by a small hotel (The Inn at Blackbeard's Castle), a pool, and a snack bar that is open when the grounds are open for tours. The restaurant closed in 2007.

Tetrablemmidae

The Tetrablemmidae are a spider family with 126 described species in 29 genera that occur throughout the world tropics. They are sometimes called "armored spiders".
The family "Pacullidae", with the only genus "Paculla", has been incorporated into this family in 1981.
Most tetrablemmids have been collected from litter and soil, including soil in epiphytes; some live in caves. Some cave species, but also some soil inhabitants, show typical adaptations of cave spiders, such as loss of eyes and weak sclerotization.
Spiders in the genus "Paculla" are four to five times larger than other tetrablemmids. The genus "Tetrablemma" features only four eyes, a trait only shared with most species of the not closely related Caponiidae.
Tetrablemmids do not seem to build webs.
Distribution.
Most genera occur in Southeast Asia, only a few in Africa and Central and South America.

Under stjernerne på himlen

"Under stjernerne på himlen" ("Under the stars of the sky") was the Danish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1993, performed in Danish by the Tommy Seebach Band.
The song was performed fifth on the night, following Switzerland's Annie Cotton with "Moi, tout simplement" and preceding Greece's Keti Garbi with "Eladha, Hora Tu Fotos". At the close of voting, it had received 9 points, placing 22nd in a field of 25.
The poor result at this Contest, coupled with the expansion of the Contest into Eastern Europe, meant that Denmark was not invited to compete in the 1994 contest, something for which Seebach himself was blamed on his return home. Much of this opprobrium still lingered at the time of his death.
It was succeeded as Danish representative at the 1995 Contest (to which Denmark had been invited) by Aud Wilken with "Fra Mols til Skagen".
Rasmus Seebach version.
Rasmus Seebach rerecorded his father's song again. The track is included in Rasmus' sophomore album "Mer' end kærlighed" and was released in October 2011 as a single reaching #3 in the "Hitlisten", the Danish Singles Chart.

Sudhan

Sudhans (also known as Sudhozai) are one of the major tribes from the districts of Poonch, Sudhanoti, Bagh and Kolti in Kashmir.
Origin.
The tribe claims an Afghan ancestry. According to Syed Ali, Sudhans have a Pashtun descent and moved to the Poonch district of Kashmir region some centuries ago. About 40,000–60,000 Sudhans were recruited and served in the British Indian Army during the First and Second World Wars.
Education.
Sudhan Education Conference is a non-governmental organization which was formed in 1939 to further the education for Sudhans.
Rebellion against Kashmir State.
The Sudhan tribe has been described as "a main and martial tribe of dissident Poonch" by Christopher Snedden, a political analyst. Sardar Ibrahim Khan, formerly a little-known barrister, was among the Sudhan people who rose to significance from 1947 as a result of a campaign and later rebellion against the Maharaja of the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu, Hari Singh. Khan led a significant faction of the Muslim Conference in their demands that Singh should join with Pakistan rather than accede to India. Together with Muslims from Bagh, it was the Sudhans who were at the heart of this campaign. The rebels were directed by the Pakistan Army, and with the support of Pashtun tribal "lashkars" sent in from the Khyber and Waziristan tribal agencies and although Kashmir state acceded to India, they were able to 'liberate' a portion called Azad Kashmir (Free Kashmir/ controlled by Pakistan).
Sudhans were not given security clearance until 1972, and were not accepted in the Pakistan Military Academy regular course until 1965.
Together with the Rajputs, it is the Sudhans who dominate the politics of Azad Kashmir in the present day, although the Gujjar community is probably the largest among the population.

Pi Sigma Alpha

Pi Sigma Alpha (ΠΣΑ or PSA), the National Political Science Honor Society, is the only honor society for college and university students of political science in the United States. Its purpose is to recognize and promote high academic achievement in the field of political science. It is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS) and adheres to all the standards set by ACHS for an upper-division, specialized honor society. Pi Sigma Alpha is not a social fraternity or club.
Chapters.
The first chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha was founded in 1920 at the University of Texas at Austin, and the society has grown over the years to over 700 chapters (as of 2012). A local chapter may be established at any college or university granting the baccalaureate or higher degrees, which is accredited by a regional or national accrediting association, and which offers a major sequence of courses in political science through an appropriate administrative department, school, or division of the institution, and which conforms to other requirements established by the Executive Council of the society. Chapters are guided by faculty advisors and by student officers.
Membership.
There are three classes of membership in Pi Sigma Alpha: student, faculty, and honorary. Student membership is open to juniors, seniors and graduate students currently enrolled in institutions where the chapters are located, who meet the following qualifications:
Faculty in political science departments where chapters are located are automatically eligible for membership in the honor society. Honorary membership is intended for persons of recognized ability and achievement in the field of political science. No more than two such honorary members may be elected by a local chapter in any one year. 
Election to membership may be based solely on stated criteria and is irrespective of membership in an affiliation with any other organization or group. Chapters may not discriminate on any basis prohibited by law. Membership, once conferred, is for life.
The lifetime national membership fee is $35.00. Individual chapters often collect additional money from each initiate to use for their own chapter programs. The initiation fee is the only payment members ever make to the national office of the honor society. There are no annual dues.
Governance.
Pi Sigma Alpha is governed by an elected Executive Council, which acts as its board of directors. The Council includes the President, the President-elect, the three most recent past presidents, the Executive Director, the Newsletter Editor, the General Counsel, and twelve other members at large. Six of these are elected every two years to serve four-year terms. Members of the Council are almost always faculty of recognized distinction in the field of political science, or of proven leadership to the honor society. Elections take place in even numbered years at the Biennial Business Meeting of the honor society. The daily business of Pi Sigma Alpha is conducted by the National Office staff.
Programs.
Pi Sigma Alpha has programs to benefit its student members and their chapters, and the profession of political science. Programs for chapters and members include an annual Chapter Activity Grants competition, Best Undergraduate Student Paper and Best Undergraduate Honors Thesis awards, Scholarships for Graduate Study in Political Science, Scholarship for Washington Internships, Best Chapter awards, and Chapter Advisor Recognition awards. For the profession of political science, Pi Sigma Alpha sponsors major speakers at the annual meetings of the American Political Science Association (APSA) and the several regional and state political science associations, and provides Best Paper awards for the APSA Annual Meeting and the regional political science association annual meetings. It also co-sponsors APSA's annual awards for teachers of political science in higher education.

<doc id="5900969" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5900969" title="Gladiator Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle">
Gladiator Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle

The Gladiator Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (TUGV) program was developed in order to support the United States Marine Corps conduct of Ship To Object Maneuver (STOM) missions through the use of a medium sized, robotic system to minimize risks and eliminate threats to Marines during conflict. The Gladiator is able to perform surveillance, reconnaissance, assault and breaching missions within its basic technical configuration.
Development.
The Gladiator Program is a U. S. Marine Corps initiative based on the Joint Army-Marine Corps Tactical Unmanned Vehicle (TUV) ORD originated by the Infantry School. MNS INT 12.1.1 dated 4 November 1993 validated the need for a tactical unmanned ground vehicle system and the Army approved the ORD in August 1995 and by the Marine Corps in May 1996. Existing unmanned vehicles contained several deficiencies which caused both Army and Marine Corps developers to reevaluate design aspects. Developments of the Gladiator allow it to support dismounted infantry and aid in scout/surveillance, direct engagement, and obstacle breeching missions.
The Marine Corp began development of the Gladiator by developing a Concept Validation Model (CVM) vehicle. The original concept for Gladiator was a vehicle that could provide reconnaissance, obscurant, and APOBS capabilities to the front line Marines. The original vehicle size was set so that two Gladiators would be able to fit into the back of a HMMWV. The first version of Gladiator was developed by a team of Government Contract Companies located in the Huntsville Alabama area but it was soon found that the requirement for two TUGVs to fit into a HMMWV made the original Gladiator CVM design top heavy and impractical.
The Marine Corp changed the size requirement to one vehicle to fit into a HMMWV and move development in 2002 to the Unmanned Ground Vehicles Technology Development group, headed by Robert Wade, at the Software Engineering Directorate located on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville Alabama. The GVTD team was lead and mechanical engineer was Keith Foslien (Government), the systems and software engineer was Brad Troyer (SAIC), the electrical engineer was Bill Brown, fabrication was Vince Davis and Mark Schulke.
There were three Gladiator CVMs developed for the Marine Corp, the first was a diesel powered tracked vehicle (shown above) while the other two were 6 wheeled hybrid electric vehicles. The original tracked CVM has a reconnaissance and weapon head, which was quickly combined in to one head that could provide both functions. The capability of the vehicles increased over the three year CVM program. The vehicles were able to support direct fire using the M240 & M248 machine guns, UZI 9mm machine gun, and the FN303 less lethal weapon. They possessed night vision capabilities and could also geolocate a target and provide a firing solution to the operator for indirect engagement of the target. The Gladiator CVM was the first safe and successful weaponized TUGV in the world.
The Gladiator CVMs were used to develop and judge TUGV capabilities, requirements, and TTPs. With the input from the CVM program, an RFP for Gladiator production went out to industry. Upon the approval of the new design on February 7, 2005, Carnegie Mellon University's National Robotics Engineering Consortium and United Defense Industries was awarded a contract for over $26 million for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase of the Gladiator. In 2007 six pre-production models were manufactured and the next step was to produce several hundred in production. US Marines elected not to go to production with the units. These six prototypes were sent to the Army and later five of the six were placed into a CRADA between the Army and Cybernet Systems Corporation. Two of these units were refitted to full autonomous operations under a contract to develop the Unit-to-Unit Autonomous Resupply Vehicle (U2UARV). The among other changes to the Gladiator, the weapons platforms were removed and replaced with interfaces to carry JMIC pallets (Joint Modular Intermodal Containers).
Purpose.
The Gladiator was designed with the intent to be easily transported to different parts of the battlefield. Rated for many types of environments, the Gladiator was to enhance the ability of Marines to accomplish assigned mission tasks. The purpose of the Gladiator was be to teleoperated just forward of the Marine units, performing basic scouting/surveillance, obstacle breaching, and reconnaissance tasks while permitting the operator to remain out of the line of danger.
The Gladiator TUGV is a robust, compact, unmanned, tele-operated, multi-purpose ground reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) vehicle system possessing a scouting and direct engagement capability. It provides the armed forces with remote reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition, nuclear, biological and chemical reconnaissance, obstacle breaching, and direct fire capability to neutralize threats and reduce risk to the warfighter. After refitting it for cargo carrying and autonomous operations over terrain and roads, it also provides small unit resupply features. The TUGV system can be utilized by infantry battalions and combat engineer companies. It small enough to be strategically, operationally, and tactically deployable worldwide for ground, aircraft and sea transport missions
Configuration.
The Gladiator is configured such that it can be considered a Mobile Base Unit, able to carry extra ammunition or other payload while at the same time maintaining the above mentioned capabilities. Due to its unmanned nature, each Gladiator is equipped with a remote control unit capable of displaying mission data, operational status and mission surveillance. The exchange between the Gladiator and the remote control unit is expected to be transmitted through a non-tethered military link.

Mattiaci

Tacitus relates that they were not required to pay tribute to the Romans but were to provide assistance in war and thus were an outpost of Roman rule on the border with Germania. He refers to them in his "Germania" (ch 29) in relation to the Batavians:
Batavians are not under the contempt of paying tribute, nor subject to be squeezed by the farmers of the revenue. Free from all impositions and payments, and only set apart for the purposes of fighting, they are reserved wholly for the wars, in the same manner as a magazine of weapons and armour. Under the same degree of homage are the nation of the Mattiacians. For such is the might and greatness of the Roman People, as to have carried the awe and esteem of their Empire beyond the Rhine and the ancient boundaries. Thus the Mattiacians, living upon the opposite banks, enjoy a settlement and limits of their own; yet in spirit and inclination are attached to us: in other things resembling the Batavians, save that as they still breathe their original air, still possess their primitive soil, they are thence inspired with superior vigour and keenness.
With the Chatti, the Mattaci took part in the Revolt of the Batavi in 69 AD, besieging the Roman city of "Mogontiacum" (present-day Mainz).
The "Notitia Dignitatum", an early 5th century document, lists two "auxilia palatina", the "Mattiaci seniores" and the "Mattiaci iuniores". The references imply Mattiaci in Roman service.

Lofepramine

Lofepramine (brand name: Emdalen (ZA), Gamanil (IE, UK (discontinued)), Lomont (UK) & Tymelyt (discontinued)) is a third generation tricyclic antidepressant which was introduced in 1983 for the treatment of depressive disorders.
Indications.
In the United Kingdom, lofepramine is licensed for the treatment of depression which is its primary use in medicine.
Side effects.
Delusions, headache, nightmares, facial oedema, general feeling of being unwell, bleeding from skin, excitement/anxiety, nausea, inflammation of mucous membranes, loss of taste, parasthesia, skin rash, psychiatric problems such as self-harm, drowsiness, dry mouth, pins and needles, heartbeat irregularities, sweating, low blood pressure, constipation, blurred vision palpatations, dizziness and urinary retention. Can cause confusion in elderly patients or behavioural disturbance in the young. May produce weight gain or cause changes in the levels of blood sugar. Some patients report muscular discomfort, particularly in the shoulders. However, lofepramine is less sedating than, for instance, amitriptyline, and is safer in overdose than older tricyclics.
Mechanism of action.
Lofepramine is a strong inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake (Ki=5.4 nM) and a moderate inhibitor of serotonin reuptake (Ki=70 nM). It is a weak-intermediate level antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (Ki values of 67 nM, 330 nM, 130 nM, 340 nM, 460 nM for M1, M2, M3, M4 & M5 respectively).
Pharmacokinetics.
It is partially converted to its active metabolite desipramine "in vivo". However, it is unlikely this property plays a substantial role in its overall effects as lofepramine exhibits lower toxicity and anticholinergic side effects relative to desipramine while retaining equivalent antidepressant efficacy.
Warnings.
To be used with caution for epileptic patients or those with glaucoma or psychosis. Lofepramine should not be given to people who have suffered liver failure or heart disease. Not advisable for use in pregnant women.
Availability.
In the United Kingdom, lofepramine is marketed (as the hydrochloride salt) in the form of 70 mg tablets and 5ml oral suspension as the generic Lomont.

Cool Hand Luke is a novel by Donn Pearce published in 1965. It was adapted into a film of the same name. The story is told in first-person narrative and is unusual in that although there is dialogue, and all quotes are indented paragraphs, they are not encased in quotation marks as in normal English-language literature. Many of the episodes found in the movie appear in the book as well, including the egg-eating contest, the "string" escape, and Boss Godfrey's shooting. Although the title character is prominent in the book, the novel deals more with the day-to-day harsh life of the prisoners than the lead character.

<doc id="5901046" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5901046" title="Crocodylomorpha">
Crocodylomorpha

Crocodylomorpha is an important group of archosaurs that includes the crocodilians and their extinct relatives.
During Mesozoic and early Cenozoic times, Crocodylomorpha was far more diverse than it is now. Triassic forms were small, lightly built, active terrestrial animals. These were supplanted during the early Jurassic by various aquatic and marine forms. The Later Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Cenozoic saw a wide diversity of terrestrial and semi-aquatic lineages. "Modern" crocodilians do not appear until the Late Cretaceous.
Evolutionary history.
When their extinct species and stem group are examined, the crocodylian lineage (clade Crurotarsi) proves to have been a very diverse and adaptive group of reptiles. Not only are they an ancient group of animals, at least as old as the dinosaurs, they also evolved into a great variety of forms. The earliest forms, the sphenosuchians, evolved during the Late Triassic, and were highly gracile terrestrial forms built like greyhounds.
During the Jurassic and the Cretaceous, marine forms in the family "Metriorhynchidae", such as "Metriorhynchus", evolved forelimbs that were paddle-like and had a tail similar to modern fish. "Dakosaurus andiniensis", a species closely related to "Metriorhynchus", had a skull that was adapted to eat large marine reptiles. Several terrestrial species during the Cretaceous evolved herbivory, such as "Simosuchus clarki" and "Chimaerasuchus paradoxus". A number of lineages during the Cenozoic became wholly terrestrial predators.
Size.
The largest crocodylomorphs are more than 9 meters long and are the extinct Crocodylus antropophagus, Sarcosuchus imperator, "Deinosuchus", and Machimosaurus.
Phylogenetic definition.
The Crocodylomorpha are defined phylogenetically by Sereno 2005 as "The most inclusive clade containing "Crocodylus niloticus" (Laurenti 1768) but not "Poposaurus gracilis" Mehl 1915, "Gracilisuchus stipanicicorum" Romer 1972, "Prestosuchus chiniquensis" Huene 1942, "Aetosaurus ferratus" Fraas 1877."
This a stem-based definition and therefore includes all taxa closer to extant crocodilians than to other crurotarsan clades.
Taxonomy and phylogeny.
Historically, all known living and extinct crocodiles were indiscriminately lumped into the order Crocodilia. However, beginning in the late 1980s, many scientists began restricting the order Crocodilia to the living species and close extinct relatives such as "Mekosuchus". The various other groups that had previously been known as Crocodilia were renamed Crocodylomorpha and the slightly more restricted Crocodyliformes. Crocodylomorpha has been given the rank of superorder in some 20th and 21st century studies.
The old Crocodilia was subdivided into the suborders:
Mesosuchia is a paraphyletic group as it does not include eusuchians (which nest within Mesosuchia). Mesoeucrocodylia was the name given to the clade that contains mesosuchians and eusuchians (Whetstone and Whybrow, 1983).
Phylogeny.
Here is the consensus of Larsson & Sues (2007) and Sereno et al. (2003):
The previous definitions of Crocodilia and Eusuchia do not accurately resemble the evolution of the group. The only order-level taxon that is currently considered valid is Crocodilia in the present definition. Prehistoric crocodiles are represented by many taxa, but since few major groups of the ancient forms are recognizable, a decision where to delimit new order-level clades is not yet possible. (Benson & Clark, 1988).

Albert Ernest Newbury (29 January 1891 – 1 April 1941) was an Australian artist.
Newbury was born in Melbourne, Victoria and spent most of his childhood in Geelong. In 1909, at the age of 18, Newbury entered the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, Melbourne, where he studied under Frederick McCubbin and Bernard Hall. In 1916, Newbury studied under Max Meldrum who influenced his work.
Career.
Newbury won the Hugh Ramsay prize for portrait-painting in 1913 – his two pictures being placed first and second. 
Newbury held a joint exhibition in 1917 with R. McCann, and gradually established a reputation for the simplicity and spaciousness of his work. Most of his paintings were landscapes, but he also did some very good portraits. 
After the death of William Beckwith McInnes in 1939 and the appointment of Charles Wheeler as master of the painting school at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Newbury was made master in the school of drawing. 
However, Newbury became ill soon afterwards and died at Eltham near Melbourne on 1 April 1941. Newbury married Ruth Trumble who survived him with one son.
His work is represented in the galleries at Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Ballarat, Geelong, and at Canberra.

Born in Mesa, Colorado, Bogert was a technician at the Division of Nature Study for the Los Angeles City Schools in California, a guide at Rocky Mountain National Park and a forest ranger for the US National Park Service at the Grand Canyon National Park before attaining his bachelor and master of arts at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Assistant curator.
From 1936 to 1940 he was the assistant curator of herpetology for the American Museum of Natural History. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation he participated in several surveys of various states in Mexico, including one with Karl Patterson Schmidt for the Field Museum of Natural History. In 1941, he was elected vice president of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists. 
Research work.
In 1944 he undertook a study on the body temperature of lizards and alligators in Florida, and became chairman and curator for the department of herpetology at the American Museum of Natural History. In 1946 he was appointed the first president of the Herpetologist's League by the league's founder Chapman Grant. From 1948 until 1950 he travelled to Central America to conduct research in Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Bimini Island off the Bahamas. 
In 1949, he published "Thermoregulation in Reptiles, a Factor in Evolution" in "Evolution". In 1950, he became an instructor at the University of Virginia, and undertook numerous trips to the southwestern United States to do research. In 1952, he was elected president of the American Society Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, which he served as until 1954. In 1953, he undertook an extensive study of frog vocalizations in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona, and released a series of records entitled "Sounds of the American Southwest" and "Sounds of the North American Frogs", as well as a recording of Mexican folk music.
Academic life.
In 1955, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for a year's research. In 1960, he became a lecturer at the University of Colorado, and began an extensive study of the Oaxaca region of Mexico. In 1966, he was given an honorary LLD from UCLA. In 1978, he became a consultant at the Los Alamos National Environmental Research Park for a year. Afterwards he continued to travel and conduct further studies, until his death in 1992 in his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Honours.
He is honored by having several reptile species named after him, including the Western Banded Gecko, "Coleonyx variegatus bogerti", and the genus of rat snakes, "Bogertophis". He travelled extensively and conducted research throughout most of the United States, Mexico, Central America, and Sri Lanka.

Protriptyline

Protriptyline (Vivactil) is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), specifically a secondary amine, indicated for the treatment of depression and ADHD. Unique among the TCAs, protriptyline tends to be energizing instead of sedating, and is sometimes used for narcolepsy to achieve a wakefulness-promoting effect.
TCAs including protriptyline are also used to reduce the incidence of recurring headaches such as migraine, and for other types of chronic pain. This drug can also be used for sleep apnea treatment along with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.
Its sale was discontinued in the UK, Australia, and Republic of Ireland in 2000.
Purpose.
Protriptyline is used primarily to treat depression and to treat the combination of symptoms of anxiety and depression.Like most antidepressants of this chemical and pharmacological class, protriptyline has also been used in limited numbers of patients to treat panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, enuresis, eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa, cocaine dependency, and the depressive phase of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive) disorder. It has also been used to support smoking cessation programs.
Description.
Protriptyline hydrochloride, a dibenzocycloheptene derivative, has a molecular weight of 299.84. It is a white to yellowish powder that is freely soluble in water and soluble in dilute HCl. Protriptyline hydrochloride is supplied as 5 mg or 10 mg tablets. Inactive ingredients are anhydrous lactose, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose.
Mechanism of action.
Protriptyline acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and to a lesser extent serotonin (5-HT) in the brain. Tricyclic antidepressants act to change the balance of naturally occurring chemicals in the brain that regulate the transmission of nerve impulses between cells. Protriptyline increases the concentration of norepinephrine and serotonin (both chemicals that stimulate nerve cells) and, to a lesser extent, blocks the action of another brain chemical, acetylcholine. The therapeutic effects of protriptyline, like other antidepressants, appear slowly. Maximum benefit is often not evident for at least two weeks after starting the drug.
Protriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, a part of the brain involved in emotions. Presynaptic receptors are affected: a1 and b1 receptors are sensitized, a2 receptors are desensitised (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain. A precise mechanism for their analgesic action is unknown, but it is thought that they modulate anti-pain opioid systems in the CNS via an indirect serotonergic route. They are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, but not in abortion of acute migraine attack. The mechanism of their anti-migraine action is also thought to be serotonergic.
Withdrawal.
Though not indicative of addiction, abrupt cessation of treatment after prolonged therapy may produce nausea, headache, and malaise.
Recommended dosage.
Protriptyline is available as 5-mg and 10-mg tablets. Doses range from 15 to 40 mg per day and can be taken in one daily dose or divided into up to four doses daily. Some people with severe depression may require up to 60 mg per day. 
In adolescents and people over age 60, therapy should be initiated at a dose of 5 mg three times a day and increased under supervision of a physician as needed. Patients over age 60 who are taking daily doses of 20 mg or more should be closely monitored for side effects such as rapid heart rate and urinary retention.
Precautions.
Like all tricyclic antidepressants, protriptyline should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision. This is especially so in the elderly, or people who have benign prostatic hypertrophy (enlarged prostate gland), or urinary retention, or glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma (the most severe form). Before starting treatment, people should discuss the relative risks and benefits of treatment with their doctors to help determine if protriptyline is the right antidepressant for them. 
A common problem with tricyclic antidepressants is sedation (drowsiness, lack of physical and mental alertness), but protriptyline is considered the least sedating agent among this class of agents. Its side effects are especially noticeable early in therapy. In most people, early tricyclic side-effects decrease or disappear entirely with time, but, until then, patients taking protriptyline should take care to assess which side-effects occur in them and should not perform hazardous activities requiring mental acuity or coordination. The side-effects are increased when protriptyline is taken with central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines, as well as with other anti-depressants including SSRIs, SNRIs or MonoAmineOxidase Inhibitors. It may be dangerous to take protriptyline in combination with these substances. Protriptyline may increase the possibility of having seizures. 
Protriptyline may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. In rare cases in which patients with cardiovascular disease must take protriptyline, they should be monitored closely for cardiac rhythm disturbances and signs of cardiac stress or damage. 
When Protriptyline is used to treat the depressive component of schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms may be aggravated. Likewise, in manic-depressive psychosis, depressed patients may experience a shift toward the manic phase if they are treated with an antidepressant drug. Paranoid delusions, with or without associated hostility, may be exaggerated. In any of these circumstances, it may be advisable to reduce the dose of Protriptyline or to use a major tranquilizing drug concurrently.
Side effects.
Protriptyline shares side effects common to all tricyclic antidepressants. The most frequent of these are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, decreased coordination, anxiety, blood disorders, confusion, decreased libido, dizziness, flushing, headache, impotence, insomnia, low blood pressure, nightmares, rapid or irregular heartbeat, rash, seizures, sensitivity to sunlight, stomach and intestinal problems. Other more complicated side effects include; chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling; sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden headache, confusion, problems with vision, speech, or balance; hallucinations, or seizure (convulsions); easy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness; restless muscle movements in your eyes, tongue, jaw, or neck; urinating less than usual or not at all; extreme thirst with headache, nausea, vomiting, and weakness; or feeling light-headed or fainting.
Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Patients may also chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless candy in order to increase the flow of saliva. Some artificial saliva products may give temporary relief. 
Men with prostate enlargement who take protriptyline may be especially likely to have problems with urinary retention. Symptoms include having difficulty starting a urine flow and more difficulty than usual passing urine. In most cases, urinary retention is managed with dose reduction or by switching to another type of antidepressant. In extreme cases, patients may require treatment with bethanechol, a drug that reverses this particular side effect.
Adverse reactions.
"Cardiovascular": Myocardial infarction; stroke; heart block; arrhythmias; hypotension, particularly orthostatic hypotension; hypertension; tachycardia; palpitation.
"Psychiatric": Confusional states (especially in the elderly) with hallucinations, disorientation, delusions, anxiety, restlessness, agitation; hypomania; exacerbation of psychosis; insomnia, panic, and nightmares.
"Neurological": Seizures; incoordination; ataxia; tremors; peripheral neuropathy; numbness, tingling, and paresthesias of extremities; extrapyramidal symptoms; drowsiness; dizziness; weakness and fatigue; headache; syndrome of inappropriate ADH (antidiuretic hormone) secretion;tinnitus; alteration in EEG patterns.
"Anticholinergic": Paralytic ileus; hyperpyrexia; urinary retention, delayed micturition, dilatation of the urinary tract; constipation; blurred vision, disturbance of accommodation, increased intraocular pressure, mydriasis; dry mouth and rarely associated sublingual adentitis.
"Allergic": Drug fever; petechiae, skin rash, urticaria, itching, photosensitization (avoid excessive exposure to sunlight); edema (general, or of face and tongue).
"Hematologic": Agranulocytosis; bone marrow depression; leukopenia;thrombocytopenia; purpura; eosinophilia.
"Gastrointestinal": Nausea and vomiting; anorexia; epigastric distress; diarrhea; peculiar taste; stomatitis; abdominal cramps; black tongue.
"Endocrine": Impotence, increased or decreased libido: gynecomastia in the male; breast enlargement and galactorrhea in the female; testicular swelling; elevation or depression of blood sugar levels.
"Other": Jaundice (simulating obstructive); altered liver function; parotid swelling; alopecia; flushing; weight gain or loss; urinary frequency, nocturia; perspiration.
Overdosage.
Deaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate tricyclic antidepressant overdose. As management of overdose is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment. Signs and symptoms of toxicity develop rapidly after tricyclic antidepressant overdose, therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible.
Critical manifestations of overdosage include: cardiac dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, convulsions, and CNS depression, including coma. Changes in the electrocardiogram, particularly in QRS axis or width, are clinically significant indicators of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.
Other signs of overdose may include: confusion, disturbed concentration, transient visual hallucinations, dilated pupils, agitation, hyperactive reflexes, stupor, drowsiness, muscle rigidity, vomiting, hypothermia, hyperpyrexia.
Metabolism.
Metabolic studies indicate that Protriptyline is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly sequestered in tissues. Relatively low plasma levels are found after administration, and only a small amount of unchanged drug is excreted in the urine of dogs and rabbits. Preliminary studies indicate that demethylation of the secondary amine moiety occurs to a significant extent, and that metabolic transformation takes place in the liver. It penetrates the brain rapidly in mice and rats, and moreover that which is present in the brain is almost all unchanged drug.
Studies on the disposition of radioactive Protriptyline in human test subjects showed significant plasma levels within 2 hours, peaking at 8 to 12 hours, then declining gradually.
Urinary excretion studies in the same subjects showed significant amounts of radioactivity in 2 hours. The rate of excretion was slow. Cumulative urinary excretion during 16 days accounted for approximately 50% of the drug. The fecal route of excretion did not seem to be important.

John James McCook (professor)

John James McCook, Jr. (born February 4, 1843 - January, 9 1927) was a chaplain in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and postbellum lawyer, professor, and theologian. He was a member of the Fighting McCooks, a family of Ohioans who contributed 15 members to the Union army.
Biography.
McCook was born in New Lisbon, Ohio. He graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut in 1863. He served in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War as a chaplain with the rank of lieutenant in the , a regiment recruited almost exclusively from Ohio. He resigned from the Army in the autumn of 1862 and returned to Kenyon to resume his studies. 
As a leading layman of the Presbyterian Church, McCook served at the heresy trial of theologian Charles Augustus Briggs in 1892. He held pastorates in Detroit, Michigan, and East Hartford, Connecticut.
In 1870, he wrote "Pat and the Council".

Sesquiterpene

Sesquiterpenes are a class of terpenes that consist of three isoprene units and have the molecular formula C15H24. Like monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes may be acyclic or contain rings, including many unique combinations. Biochemical modifications such as oxidation or rearrangement produce the related sesquiterpenoids.
Sesquiterpenes are found naturally in plants and insects, as semiochemicals, e.g. defensive agents or pheromones.
Acyclic.
When geranyl pyrophosphate reacts with isopentenyl pyrophosphate, the result is the 15-carbon farnesyl pyrophosphate, which is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes such as farnesene. Oxidation can then provide sesquiterpenoids such as farnesol. 
Monocyclic.
With the increased chain length and additional double bond, the number of possible ways that cyclization can occur is also increased, and there exists a wide variety of cyclic sesquiterpenes. In addition to common six-membered ring systems such as is found in zingiberene, a constituent of the oil from ginger, cyclization of one end of the chain to the other end can lead to macrocyclic rings such as humulene.
Bicyclic.
In addition to common six-membered rings such as in the cadinenes, one classic bicyclic sesquiterpene is caryophyllene, from the oil of cloves, which has a nine-membered ring and cyclobutane ring. Additional unsaturation provides aromatic bicyclic sesquiterpenoids such as vetivazulene and guaiazulene.
Tricyclic.
With the addition of a third ring, the possible structures become increasingly varied. Examples include longifolene, copaene and the alcohol patchoulol.
Dictyophorine A and B.
Two novel sesquiterpenes have been identified from the fruit bodies of the fungus, named dictyophorine A and B. These compounds are based on the eudesmane skeleton (a common structure found in plant-derived flavors and fragrances), are the first eudesmane derivatives isolated from fungi. The dictyophorines promote the synthesis of nerve growth factor in astroglial cells.

Fra Mols til Skagen

Fra Mols til Skagen ("From Mols to Skagen") was the Danish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1995, performed in Danish by Aud Wilken.
The song was performed nineteenth on the night, following Sweden's Jan Johansen with "Se på mej" and preceding Slovenia's Darja Švajger with "Prisluhni mi". At the close of voting, it had received 92 points, placing 5th in a field of 23.
The song is a love ballad, with Wilken singing about her desire to be with her lover - she asks him to tell her when the trains are leaving, so that she can be with him, for example. The title of the song comes from her description of the breadth of her feelings about him - "From Mols to Skagen I'm missing you". Mols is located in eastern Jutland, with Skagen being the northernmost town in the country, so the pair of locations does not span very much of Denmark.<br>
Musically, the song is comparatively slow as against the increasingly up-tempo contest entries. The song was chosen as a winner of the Danish song contest by a jury of music professionals contrary to the usual way of letting the television audience vote by phone. Initially the song didn't enjoy much popularity in the general public, but that seemed to change after its relatively high placing in the international contest.
Despite the successful placement of the song, Denmark did not participate in the 1996 contest, as the qualification rules had been changed to require "all" competing countries barring the host nation to qualify - something the Danes were unable to accomplish. The performance was, however, enough to qualify Denmark as one of the entrants in the next Contest. Hence, it was succeeded as Danish representative at the 1997 contest by Kølig Kaj with "Stemmen i mit liv".

Isao Takagi

Isao Takagi (高木功 "Takagi Isao", born November 8, 1961), who goes by the stage name Arashi, is a Japanese professional wrestler from Moriguchi, Osaka Prefecture, who works for Dradition. He has previously worked for All Japan Pro Wrestling.
Career.
Takagi was initially a sumo wrestler under the name of Takuetsuyama (previously Maenohikari). He joined Takadagawa stable, run by former ozeki Maenoyama, in 1977. He reached elite sekitori status upon promotion to the second highest juryo division in July 1985, but was demoted back to the unsalaried makushita division after only four tournaments. In 1986, at the age of 24, he decided to quit sumo and joined AJPW upon an offer from owner Giant Baba. He made his debut in 1987. The same year he accompanied Baba to an excursion into Jim Crockett Promotions, where they competed in the Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup. They made it into the semifinals before being defeated by Lex Luger and Tully Blanchard.
Takagi remained a strong member of the undercard, feuding with dojo classmates Akira Taue, Kenta Kobashi, Tsuyoshi Kikuchi and Tatsumi Kitahara. In 1990, however, he decided to follow former sumo wrestler Genichiro Tenryu out of AJPW and into a new promotion, Super World of Sports. After its collapse in 1992, Takagi wandered in the independents formed from it until settling down in the successor promotion, WAR.
In WAR he adopted the name Arashi (storm). His first success came teaming with Koki Kitahara (formerly known as Tatsumi), and with Nobutaka Araya, formerly of International Wrestling Association of Japan, to win the WAR 6-Man Tag Team Championship.
In 1998, as WAR went into decline due to Tenryu making a comeback in New Japan Pro Wrestling, Arashi went to Yoshiaki Yatsu's SPWF promotion. He stayed there until Tenryu called him back to AJPW in 2001. Initially he supported Tenryu's WAR faction, but after Tenryu left yet again, aligned himself with Keiji Mutoh, and won the World Tag Team Championship with him in 2003. On December 27, he and Muto (under his Great Muta persona) defeated Christopher Daniels and Dan Maff to retain the titles at a ROH vs. All Japan card.
Arashi made the finals of the Champion Carnival the same year, where he fell to Satoshi Kojima. He received a shot at Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion Shinya Hashimoto, but was defeated.
After he and Mutoh lost the World Tag Team Championship to Kojima and Kaz Hayashi, Arashi was relegated back to the mid-card.
In September 2006, after a trial on drug charges, Takagi was sentenced to three years in prison. Freed after serving a portion of his sentence, Takagi returned to puroresu, wrestling in Tatsumi Fujinami's Muga World (now Dradition) promotion.

<doc id="5901144" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5901144" title="Iprindole">
Iprindole

Iprindole (Prondol, Galatur, Tertran), formerly known as pramindole, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) used in Europe for the treatment of depression. It was introduced by Wyeth and has been used clinically since 1967. Notably, iprindole was the first second-generation antidepressant to be launched.
Iprindole is unique compared to most other TCAs in that it is a relatively weak inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine and instead acts predominantly as an antagonist of 5-HT2 receptors, hence its classification as 'second-generation'. Additionally, side effects of iprindole are much less prominent relative to other TCAs and it is well tolerated. However, iprindole's efficacy may not be as great as other TCAs, especially in regards to anxiety relief.
Availability.
Iprindole was sold under the trade name Prondol by Wyeth in the United Kingdom and Ireland for the indication of major depressive disorder, and has also been sold as Galatur and Tertran by Wyeth as well.
It has been discontinued throughout the world.
Chemistry.
On a structural level, iprindole differs from other TCAs in that it contains an indole nucleus, similarly to the heterocyclic antipsychotic oxypertine, and has an eight-membered and saturated third ring.
Pharmacology.
Iprindole acts as an antagonist (or inverse agonist) at the following receptors:
And as an inhibitor of the following transporters:
It has negligible affinity (>10,000 nM) for β-adrenergic and sigma receptors.
Dosage.
Iprindole is used in doses of 30–180 mg daily.
Side effects.
Anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth and constipation are either greatly reduced in comparison to imipramine and most other TCAs or fully lacking with iprindole. However, it still has potent antihistamine effects and therefore can produce sedation, though this is diminished relative to imipramine as well, perhaps due to iprindole lacking significant alpha-blocking properties.
Contraindications.
Iprindole has been associated with jaundice and hepatotoxicity and should not be taken by alcoholics or people with pre-existing liver disease. If such symptoms are encountered iprindole should be discontinued immediately.
Interactions.
Iprindole has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the aromatic hydroxylation and/or "N"-dealkylation-mediated metabolism of many substances including, but not limited to octopamine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, fenfluramine, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, trimipramine, and fluoxetine, likely via inactivating cytochrome P450 enzymes. It also inhibits its own degradation.
On account of these interactions, caution should be used when combining iprindole with other drugs. As an example, when administered with amphetamine or methamphetamine, iprindole increases their brain concentrations and prolongs their half-lives by 2- to 3-fold, strongly augmenting both their physiological effects and neurotoxicity in the process.
Overdose.
In overdose, iprindole is much less toxic than most other TCAs and is considered relatively benign. For instance, between 1974 and 1985, only two deaths associated with iprindole were recorded in the United Kingdom, whereas 278 were reported for imipramine. However, it should be noted that imipramine is prescribed much more often than iprindole, and for that reason this comparison is likely not entirely representative of iprindole's true capacity for fatality in overdose.

Monoterpene

Monoterpenes are a class of terpenes that consist of two isoprene units and have the molecular formula C10H16. Monoterpenes may be linear (acyclic) or contain rings. Biochemical modifications such as oxidation or rearrangement produce the related monoterpenoids.
Acyclic monoterpenes.
Biosynthetically, isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate are combined to form geranyl pyrophosphate. 
Elimination of the pyrophosphate group leads to the formation of acyclic monoterpenes such as ocimene and the myrcenes. Hydrolysis of the phosphate groups leads to the prototypical acyclic monoterpenoid geraniol. Additional rearrangements and oxidations provide compounds such as citral, citronellal, citronellol, linalool, and many others. Many monoterpenes found in marine organisms are halogenated, such as halomon.
Monocyclic monoterpenes.
In addition to linear attachments, the isoprene units can make connections to form rings. The most common ring size in monoterpenes is a six-membered ring. A classic example is the cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to form limonene. 
The terpinenes, phellandrenes, and terpinolene are formed similarly. Hydroxylation of any of these compounds followed by dehydration can lead to the aromatic p-cymene. Important terpenoids derived from monocyclic terpenes are menthol, thymol, carvacrol and many others.
Bicyclic monoterpenes.
Geranyl pyrophosphate can also undergo two sequential cyclization reactions to form bicyclic monoterpenes, such as pinene which is the primary constituent of pine resin. 
Other bicyclic monoterpenes include carene, sabinene, camphene, and thujene. Camphor, borneol and eucalyptol are examples of bicyclic monoterpenoids containing ketone, alcohol, and ether functional groups, respectively.
Role in climate.
Monoterpenes are emitted by forests and form aerosols that can serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Such aerosols can increase the brightness of clouds and cool the climate.
Uses.
Several monoterpenes have antibacterial activity, such as linalool.

Frank E. Bauer Bridge

The Frank E. Bauer Bridge is 0.19 mile (0.31 km) toll bridge that traverses the Rock River in Machesney Park, Illinois. It is one of four toll bridges in the state of Illinois. The bridge consists of four lanes, a median and shoulders, as well as a sidewalk which is not tolled. It connects Illinois Route 2 north of Rockford, Illinois with commercial areas of Machesney Park and Illinois Route 251 via the Bauer Parkway and Harlem Road (Winnebago County Highway 25).
The bridge opened in 1993. As of 2006, the toll for all vehicles was 50 cents per vehicle, payable only in coins or tokens. I-Pass, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority's electronic toll collection system, is not accepted due to the large upfront costs of installing I-PASS at the bridge. The Bauer Bridge was tolled to pay for bonds issued for its construction, scheduled to be repaid by 2013. Toll collection ceased on April 1, 2013.

Movin' Melodies

"Movin' Melodies" is André Tanneberger's first album under the name of ATB. It includes the singles "9 PM (Till I Come)", "Don't Stop" and "Killer". The album was written, produced, arranged and engineered by ATB.
Unlike the singles, the typical ATB-sound is hardly used on the album's other tracks. Tanneberger did not want to put together a pure dance album. Therefore, in addition to more club-oriented songs, there are also quiet, melodic tracks that reflect his preference for sound compositions by Enigma, Mike Oldfield and Jean Michel Jarre. Track 12 ("Beach Vibes") is commonly misnamed as "Ocean Trance".

Simpson Newland

Simpson Newland CMG (2 November 1835 – 27 June 1925), pastoralist, author and politician, was a pioneer in Australia who made significant contributions to development around the Murray River. He was also an author of practical works and novels.
Ridgway William Newland.
Simpson Newland was born on 2 November 1835 at Hanley, Staffordshire, England, son of Rev. Ridgway Newland and his second wife Martha, née Keeling. 
His father, the Rev. Ridgway William Newland (1790–1864), was a Congregational minister at Hanley for twenty-two years. He was selected by the Colonial Missionary Society to form a settlement in South Australia, and sailed in the "Sir Charles Forbes" with some thirty colonists, including his second wife Martha, an accomplished linguist and classical scholar, who cared for her three young children and five of Newland's first marriage. The party arrived in Adelaide in June 1839 and went on in the "Lord Hobart" to Encounter Bay, where a large area of land was taken up.
The life was a hard one for the pioneers, and even when they succeeded in growing a crop of wheat, there were no facilities for threshing it or grinding it into flour. Sheep and cattle were procured and the family gradually prospered. A church was built at which the father held services, but he would accept no money for his ministrations.
Ridgway Newland also became a magistrate and was for many years chairman of the Encounter Bay district council. Everywhere looked upon as the leading man of his denomination. He was fatally injured when his coach capsized, and died at the age of 75 on 9 March 1864. A church was built in his honour at Victor Harbor, and Newland's Head and the Newland Bridge are named after him.
Early years.
Simpson Newland was at first a sickly boy, but the open air life improved his health, and he became a competent stockrider and bushman. His evenings were largely given up to improving his education with the help of his mother.
Pastoralist and prosperity.
In 1864 Newland took up station life on the Darling River in New South Wales some 50 miles from Wilcannia, and became more and more interested in the indigenous people and the natural history of the country. He improved the breeds of his sheep and cattle, and by age 40 had become very prosperous. On 12 September 1872 at Buckanbee, New South Wales, he married Jane Isabella Layton.
Undelcarra.
In 1876, with three sons, they moved to Adelaide and bought a mansion at Burnside which they called "Undelcarra"; Newland continued to manage the stations from Adelaide.
George Debney was a leading furniture maker in Rundle Street and one of the first owners of the estate that was later known as Undelcarra. The estate stretched north from Second Creek, between Lockwood Road and Hallett Road up to approximately where Statenborough Street is now located. The Debneys lived on the property from the 1850s till 1877 when it was sold to Simpson Newland who significantly enlarged the house and called it Undelcarra.
Undelcarra belonged to Simpson Newland between 1876 and 1911. He is best known as author of the book Paving the Way but was also a pastoralist from the River Darling area where his Marra Station had an out-station named Undelcarra which is said to be Aboriginal for ‘under the hill with running water’. 
The estate passed into the hands of Torrens Ward, solicitor from 1911–1919. 
It was purchased in 1919 by Alfred Allen Simpson of A. Simpson & Co whitegoods manufacturers. The house is still owned by his descendants.
Final subdivision was in 1969, but the house still stands in Undelcarra Road. 
The gatehouse which is still on Lockwood Road near the bridge over Second Creek was converted into a private residence and the main driveway re-routed to have access from Undelcarra Road. The gates that are now seen there were originally on Glynburn Road at the end of the driveway to the house "Erindale".
Other nearby streets include Debney Drive, Newland Road, Torrens Avenue (in Erindale), and Undelcarra Road.
Politics and public life.
He entered the House of Assembly in 1881 as member for Encounter Bay, and soon afterwards brought in a measure to build a north to south railway on the land grant system which was defeated.
In June 1885 he became treasurer in the Downer ministry but, finding the strain of his duties too much for his health, resigned the position a year later. 
He took much interest in the development of the River Murray and revived the question of the north-south railway. He succeeded in getting a royal commission appointed to consider it, and as chairman of the commission personally examined the country as far north as Alice Springs. In two pamphlets, "The Far North Country" (1887) and "Our Waste Lands" (1888), Newland gave an account of his journey and his views on the possibilities of the districts traversed. In 1889 he visited England and while there heard of the discovery of rich ore at Broken Hill. He had acquired an interest in the new field and this now became very valuable.
Author.
On his return, encouraged by his friend Sir John Langdon Bonython, for whose paper (The "Advertiser") he had written a number of articles, he wrote his novel, "Paving the Way", which embodied many of his experiences as a pioneer and with indigenous people. 
He went to England again in 1893 and arranged for the publication of his book. It was released the same year and was given a good reception by the critics. A second edition was published in 1894 and it has since been several times reprinted. Newland also published a second novel, "Blood Tracks of the Bush", in 1900, which was less successful than his earlier work, "partly because inferior, but also because he courageously and accurately portrayed horrific mass-murders of Aborigines by police and pastoralists. The public was not ready for such honesty."
North-south railway line.
On Newland's return to Adelaide at the end of 1893, he began collecting material for a pamphlet on the Northern Territory, and the necessity for its being linked to the south by a railway. 
In 1899 he visited England and obtained the promise of support from financial interests in London, and returning to Australia obtained parliamentary sanction for the construction of a railway on the land grant system in 1902. His pamphlet, "Land-Grant Railway across Australia: The Northern Territory of the State of South Australia as a Field for Enterprise and Capital", was published by the government at the end of that year. In 1906 he again went to England and succeeded in floating a company to undertake the building of the line. On his return he found that a Labor government under Thomas Price had come into power, and as the policy of Labor was opposed to building lines on the land grant system, Newland realized that nothing could be done at the time.
Other interests.
He resumed his work on the development of a river port on the Murray, he had become a vice-president of the River Murray league in 1902, and the question was kept alive in 1903 and 1904 by holding public meetings. On 28 July 1904 Newland was elected president of the league, and the necessity of developing the Murray was kept steadily before the public for many years. A great step forward was made in 1914, when the Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Joseph Cook, pledged £1,000,000 from the Commonwealth if each of the three states interested would spend a similar amount, which is what occurred.
Newland had many interests. In 1895–1900 and again in 1920–22 he was president of the South Australian branch of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, and in 1906–23 president of the South Australian Zoological and Acclimatization Society. He deplored the European destruction of the environment and proposed that the Coorong area should be reserved for Aborigines and the land reforested. In 1922 he was appointed C.M.G. (Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George).
He had published a pamphlet in middle life, "A Band of Pioneers, Old-Time Memories" (2nd ed. 1919), which included an interesting account of the arrival of his family in 1839. This was incorporated in his "Memoirs of Simpson Newland", written in the last year of his long life. It was completed on 6 June 1925 and showed him to be still in full command of his mental powers. He died three weeks later, but before he died he knew that it had definitely been decided to complete the north to south railway line; his other dream of a (sea-)port at the mouth of the Murray still awaits fulfilment.
Family.
Newland died on 27 June 1925 at North Adelaide, survived by his wife and three of their five sons. His ashes were taken to his spiritual home, Victor Harbor, for burial.
Colonel Sir Henry Simpson Newland DSO, CBE (1873–1969), their eldest son, was an accomplished surgeon known for his public works and as a founder of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. 
Philip Mesmer Newland (1875–1916) was an Australian sportsman who excelled at Australian rules football, cricket and lacrosse. He played Sheffield Shield cricket for South Australia as a wicket-keeper and toured England with the Australian Test team in 1905. He played Australian rules football with the Norwood Football Club and captained Norwood's 1904 premiership winning team.
Major Victor Marra Newland MC, OBE (1876–1953), their third son, had a distinguished military career, was a successful business man, a member of the stock exchange, and in the period 1933–38 represented North Adelaide for the Liberal and Country League in the House of Assembly.
Doctor Clive Newland (1878–1919), a graduate of London University, had a practice at Morphett Vale. He was killed in a railway accident, when the motorcycle he was riding collided with an uncoming train.
Ralph Dimmock Newland (1880–1933), their youngest son, represented South Australia at lacrosse.

Prendeur

A prendeur, a French term, is a labourer working as part of an early Middle Age share cropping system known as "complant", a precursor to the métayage system. Under this system, the "prendeur" would cultivate land owned by a bailleur. In exchange for using the "bailleur's" soil, the "prendeur" promised a share of the crop or its revenue. The length of this partnership varied and sometimes would extend over generations.

Horatio Torromé

Horatio Tertuliano Torromé, also credited as Henri Torromé, (1861 – 16 September 1920) was a British figure skater who also competed for Argentina. He was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and died in Willesden, Greater London.
He represented Argentina at the 1908 Summer Olympics, where he was the only competitor for that country. He had nearly competed for the British team instead, having been selected to the UK team. He scored 228.9 points in the men's individual competition, placing last of the 7 skaters who finished competition.
Torromé also served as a judge for the pairs competition at the same Games.

<doc id="5901188" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5901188" title="Opipramol">
Opipramol

Opipramol (Insidon, Pramolan, Ensidon, Oprimol) is an antidepressant and anxiolytic used in Germany and other European countries.Although it is a member of the tricyclic antidepressants, opipramol's primary mechanism of action is much different in comparison. Most TCAs act as reuptake inhibitors, but opipramol does not, and instead acts as a sigma receptor agonist, among other properties.It is an iminostilbene derivative, belonging to dibenzazepine group. Opipramol was developed by Schindler and Blattner in 1961.
Medical uses.
Opipramol is typically used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Its anxiolysis becomes prominent after only one to two weeks of chronic administration. Upon first commencing treatment, opipramol is rather sedating in nature due to its antihistamine properties, but this effect becomes less prominent with time.
Opipramols sigma-1 agonizing effects likely impart potent antitussive effects, many other sigma-1 agonists (ex. codeine, hydrocodone, and dextromethorphan) are used for this purpose.
Pregnancy and lactation.
Experimental animal studies did not indicate injurious effects of opipramol on the embryonic development or the fertility. Opipramol should be prescribed during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, only for compelling indication.
Opipramol should not be used during lactation period, since the active ingredient passes into the milk in small quantities. At compelling indication it is to be ablactated.
Pharmacology.
Opipramol acts as a high affinity sigma receptor agonist, primarily at the σ1 subtype, but also at the σ2 subtype with somewhat lower affinity. It is this property which is responsible for its therapeutic benefits against anxiety and depression. Opipramol also acts as a low to moderate affinity antagonist for the D2, 5-HT2, H1, H2, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. H1 and H2 receptor antagonism account for its antihistamine effects, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism is responsible for its anticholinergic properties. Sigma receptors as a set of proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum, σ1 receptors play key role in potentiating intracellular calcium mobilization thereby acting as sensor or modulator of calcium signalling. Occupancy of σ1 receptors by agonists causes translocation of the receptor from endoplasmic reticulum to peripheral areas (membranes) where the σ1 receptors and neurotransmitter release. The biphasic action initially makes prompt improvement of tension, anxiety and insomnia. Opipramol is a tranquilizer with a thymoleptic component. After sub-chronic treatment, opipramol is significantly down-regulated to σ2 but not σ1 sites.
Pharmacokinetics.
Opipramol is rapidly and completely absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. Its terminal plasma half life is 6-11 hours. After single oral administration of 50 mg, the peak plasma concentration of the drug is reached after 3.3 hours and amounts to 15.6 ng/ml. After single oral administration of 100 mg the maximum plasma concentration is reached after 3 hours and amounts to 33.2 ng/ml. The bioavailability of opipramol amounts to 94%. The plasma protein binding amounts to approximately 91% and the volume distribution is approximately 10 L/kg. Opipramol is partially metabolized in liver as deshydroxy ethyl-opipramol. Metabolization occurs through CYP2D6-isoenzyme. Elimination is 70% renally and 10% unaltered. Remaining portion is eliminated through faeces.
Adverse effects.
Opipramol is a well-tolerated drug and produces less side effects as compared to SSRIs and SNRIs.
Paradoxical reactions.
The frequently (≥1% to <10%) reported adverse reactions with opipramol especially at the beginning of the treatment includes fatigue, dry mouth, blocked nose, hypotension and orthostatic dysregulation.
The adverse reactions reported occasionally(≥0.1% to <1%) includes dizziness, stupor, micturition disturbances, accommodation disturbances, tremor, weight gain, thirst, allergic skin reactions (rash, uriticaria), abnormal ejaculation, erectile impotence, constipation, transient increase in liver enzyme activities, tachycardia and palpilations.
Rarely (≥0.01% to <0.1%) reported adverse reaction includes excitation, headache, parethesia especially in elderly patients, restlessness, sweating, sleep disturbances, oedema, galactorrhea, urine blockage, nausea and vomiting, collapse conditions, stimulation conducting disturbances, intensification of present heart insufficiency, blood profile changes particularly leukopenia, confusion, delirium, stomach complaints, taste disturbance and paralytic ileus especially with sudden discontinuation of a longer term high dose therapy.
Very rarely (<0.01%) adverse reaction includes seizures, motor disorder, (akathisia, dyskinesia), ataxia, polyneuropathy, glaucoma, anxiety, hairfall, agranulocytosis, severe liver dysfunction after long term treatment, jaundice and chronic liver damage.
Overdosage.
Symptoms of intoxications includes drowsiness, insomnia, stupor, agitation, coma, transient confusion, increased axiety, ataxia, convulsions, oligouria, anuria, tachycardia or bradycardia, arrhythmia, AV block, hypotension, shock, respiratory depression, rarely, cardiac arrest.
As therapy of intoxication, specific antidote is not available, removal of the drug by vomiting or gastric lavage should be done. Continuous cardiovascular monitoring for at least 48 hours should be done. In case of respiratory failure due to overdose, intubation and artificial respiration should be done. During severe hypotension due to overdose, corresponding recumbent positioning, plasma expander, dopamine or dobutamine as drops-infusion should be initiated. In heart rhythm disturbances, individualized treatment should be done where appropriate pacemaker and compensation in low potassium levels and possible acidosis should be done. While in convulsions due to overdose, administration of intravenous diazepam or another anti-convulsant agent such as phenobarbital or paraldehyde should be done though intensification of existing respiratory insufficiency, hypotension or coma may happen. 
Drug interactions.
The therapy with Opipramol indictates an additional therapy with neuroleptics, hypnotics and tranquilizers (eg. Barbituarates, Benzodiapines). Thereby it should be noted that some specific reactions, particularly central-subduing effects could be intensified and an intensification of common side effects may occur. If necessary the dosage may be reduced. 
Co-administration with alcohol can cause stupor.
MAO Inhibitors should be discontinued at least 14 days before the treatment with opipramol. Concomitant use of Opipramol with β-blockers, antiarrhythmics (of class 1c), as well as drugs from tricyclic antidepressants group and preparations which influence the microsomal enzyme system, can lead to change in plasma concentration of these drugs. Co-administration of neuroleptics (example- haloperidol, risperidone) can increase the plasma concentration. Barbituarates and anti-convulsants can reduce the plasma concentration of Opipramol and thereby weaken the therapeutic effect.

Minamiaso, Kumamoto

It was formed on February 13, 2005 from the merger of the villages of Chōyō, Hakusui and Kugino. Neighbouring towns are Takamori, Ozu, and Nishihara.
As of December 31, 2009, the village has an estimated population of 12,015 (5,776 male, 6,239 female) and a population density of 91.2 persons per km². The total area is 137.30 km².
History.
Minamiaso is situated within Aso Caldera, one of the largest volcanic calderas in the world. For more information, refer to the entry on Mt. Aso.
Minamiaso was once three separate villages: Chōyō, Hakusui and Kugino. In 2005, it was decided that these villages would merge along with neighboring area Tateno to become Minamiaso village, which would stretch between Ozu and Takamori.
Merger.
Due to declining birth rate, aging population and the opportunity to share administrative resources, discussions between the three villages (Chōyō, Hakusui and Kugino) began on April 1, 2003. The merger was complete on February 13, 2005.
Education.
There are no public high schools in Minamiaso.
Transportation.
Rail.
Trains going to Ozu, Miyaji (Aso City) or non-express trains bound for Oita will stop at Tateno Station. Those trains bound for Ozu will end their journey there and connecting train will be waiting at the adjacent platform. A change will also need to be made at Tateno to the Minamiaso Tetsudou line, which is not a JR line so JR Rail Passes will not be valid. From Tateno to Chōyō (the first station in Minamiaso-mura) costs 230 yen.

Operation Prime Time

Operation Prime Time (OPT) was a consortium of American independent television stations to develop prime time programming for independent stations. OPT and its spin-off syndication company, Television Program Enterprises (TPE), were formed by Al Masini. During its existence, OPT was considered the "de facto" fourth television network. OPT was also called an occasional television network and occasional program alternative.
OPT inspired syndication and network models that arose in later years, such as The Disney Afternoon, Prime Time Entertainment Network and MyNetworkTV.
Operations.
Opposite of the standard network advertising split, the stations got the bulk of the ad time with the collective network only received one or two minutes of the dozen minutes available to sell. The OPT ad time would be sold at 1/3 of network rates or about $40,000 per half minute with the profits going back to the stations.
Background.
With primarily only Big Three television networks providing new programming to TV stations in the 1970s, the unaffiliated stations had little network level quality programming to offer to advertisers. Producers of TV programs were also looking for an alternative to the standard network set up that paid the producers about three fourths of the production costs thus the show would only make money for the production company if it made enough episodes to place into rerun syndication. Advertisers were looking for new advertising outlets due to rising network ad costs with a 30% increase in 1977. Networks' income increased 143% from 1969 to 1974 while network payments to affiliates decreased by 2%.
History.
Al Masini, who represented 18 stations for advertising sales through his company TeleRep, discussed the independent stations' problem with other independent stations after a broadcast media meeting in February 1976. Determined to offer an alternative, Masini rounded up a steering committee to form the new venture. Initial members of the committee included Shelly Cooper, General Manager of WGN-TV Chicago, Rich Frank of KCOP-TV Los Angeles, and representatives of KTVU, WPIX and KSTW. At the next broadcaster convention, the committee met to develop the details. The OPT committee then contacted Frank Price of Universal Television for the first program. Price offered Taylor Caldwell's novel "Testimony of Two Men" as a miniseries with Universal taking on a fifth of the production cost. The committee was initially able to get 22 independent and 53 network-affiliated stations to sign on to OPT. Advertisers like General Foods and Bristol-Myers abandoned the rival potential fourth network, Metromedia's MetroNet, for OPT, based on Metromedia's near Big 3 network cost per thousand viewers advertising cost and OPT reaching 80% of the country. Masini eventually lined up 93 stations, 73 of which were affiliates of ABC, NBC or CBS; of those affiliated with a network, these affiliates had to preempt part of their regular network prime time programming to make room for specials from OPT. KCOP's broadcast of "Testimony of Two Men"'s first installment got a 16 rating and the second installment got an 18, well over their standard 4 rating, but in May, a traditional rerun period for the networks.
List of programs produced by OPT.
Its initial programs were miniseries including adaptations of "Testimony of Two Men" and "Son of the Captains and the Kings", the sequel to the 1976 NBC miniseries "Captains and the Kings", also adapted from a novel by Caldwell. OPT also distributed the animated Christmas special "Yogi's First Christmas" (now owned by Warner Bros. Television). 
The most successful program from both OPT and TPE was, and still is, "Entertainment Tonight", now produced and distributed entirely by CBS Television Distribution. Other programs included "Solid Gold", "Star Search", and "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous".

Stemmen i mit liv

"Stemmen i mit liv" ("The voice in my life") was the Danish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1997, performed in Danish by Kølig Kaj.
The song was performed 21st on the night, following Russia's Alla Pugacheva with "Primadonna" and preceding France's Fanny with "Sentiments songes". At the close of voting, it had received 25 points, placing 16th in a field of 25.
The song deals with the singer's difficulties in speaking to the object of his strong affections. The lyrics are ambiguous as to whether this is a real person or an automated voice on the directory enquiries service. A parody of this song was recorded by a satirical group entitled "Farlig Fredag" (Meaning "Harmful Friday"). 
Due to the poor placement, Denmark was relegated from the 1998 contest. Thus, the song was succeeded as Danish representative at the 1999 contest by Michael Teschl & Trine Jepsen with "This Time I Mean It". 
The introduction of the free language rule has meant that to date, "Stemmen i mit liv" has been the last song, to be performed in Danish at the Eurovision Song Contest.

Fray Mocho

Fray Mocho was the pen name for the Argentine writer and journalist José Ciriaco Alvarez (also known as José Sixto Alvarez). He was born in the remote village of Gualeguaychú in the Entre Ríos Province of Argentina on August 26, 1858. He came to Buenos Aires first in 1876 and then again (to stay) in 1879 at the age of 21. He was known to his friends as “Mocho” (blunt) and later added the title “Fray” (brother, as in a Friar in the Catholic Church). He wrote for several newspapers including "El Nacional", "La Pampa", "La Patria Argentina", and "La Razón". He also wrote for magazines such as the short-lived "Fray Gerundio", "El Ateneo" and "La Colmena Artística". He wrote essays about life in Buenos Aires in the latter part of the 19th century, including "Esmeraldas" (polished), "Cuentos Mundanos" (Ordinary Stories), "La vida de los ladrones célebres de Buenos Aires y sus maneras de robar" (“The life of celebrated robbers of Buenos Aires and their manner of robbing") and "Memorias de un Vigilante" (Memoirs of a policeman). In 1898 he wrote the book "En el Mar Austral" (“In the Southern Sea").
Literary Achievements.
The period in which he flourished was a heady time in Buenos Aires. The nation of Argentina had finally come together with the uniting of the city of Buenos Aires with the rest of the country, the great Sarmiento and Mitre were still alive, and Buenos Aires was striving to become the “Queen City” of South America.
He was the founder and first editor of the Argentine Magazine "Caras y Caretas" (Faces and Masks). The magazine featured a mixture of cartoons and illustrations along with national and foreign subjects taken from social news, notes of general interest and fashion. The magazine also published literary and rural literature. Its contributors include some of the leading lights of Argentine letters: Roberto Payró, Horacio Quiroga, and José Ingenieros, among others. He was the first professional writer of Argentina. In his descriptions of regional customs, the narrator is a watching observer. He wrote at times in the different modes of Buenos Aires speech including the “lunfardo” (the argot or slang of Buenos Aires which still exists). His writing was part of a movement of “modernism” which was a reaction against the prevailing romanticism and the rigidity of the Castilian Spanish language and literature before his time, and which had a counterpart in the Paris of the same period.
One of his most interesting works was the book "En El Mar Austral" (On the Southern Sea). This is a tale of a year spent traveling on a whaling boat around the southern tip of Chile and Argentina (Tierra del Fuego) beginning in the town of Punta Arenas in Chile. It describes in great and loving detail the scenery and life in the southernmost tip of South America. It does not appear that Fray Mocho ever got within 500 miles of Tierra del Fuego and yet his descriptions are extremetly accurate, and the source of his information is still not known.
Death.
Fray Mocho died on 23 August 1903, just 3 days short of his 45th birthday; an illness that had troubled him for years eventually causing his death. It is said that "he feared no one and nothing because he had damaged no one and had a pure heart” (as is stated in an edition of "En El Mar Austral" published in 1960 by The University of Buenos Aires). His last words were “I die fighting”. His magazine lived on until 1941.

Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku

Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku () is a collection of eighteen poetic works created during the 'post Sangam period' (between 100 - 500 CE). The poems of this collection differ from the earlier works of the "Patiṉeṇmēlkaṇakku", which are the oldest surviving Tamil poetry. The poems are written in the venpa meter and are relatively short in length. Most of the books deal with morals and ethics
"Pathinenkilkanakku" contains the following books:

5-HT2 receptor

The 5-HT2 receptors are a subfamily of 5-HT receptors that bind the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). The 5-HT2 subfamily consists of three G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are coupled to Gq/G11 and mediate excitatory neurotransmission, including 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C.

Progressive muscle relaxation

Progressive muscle relaxation is a technique for learning to monitor and control the state of muscular tension. It was developed by American physician Edmund Jacobson in the early 1920s. 
Dr Jacobson wrote several books on the subject of Progressive Relaxation. The technique involves learning to monitor tension in each specific muscle group in the body by deliberately inducing tension in each group. This tension is then released, with attention paid to the contrast between tension and relaxation. These learning sessions are not exercises or self-hypnotism. 
A modification of the technique is "Biofeedback" in which one uses external measuring devices to indicate how successful one is in relaxing and then to use those techniques to relax without the help of external measuring devices.
In the training sessions which are started in a darkened room with the learner in a reclined position and eyes closed. The learner is told to relax, just let go. If the learner has any thoughts or physical distractions, just relax. Do not try to solve the problem. In each session the teacher reviews tensing one particular muscle group. If the student is slow in learning how to let the tension go for a particular muscle group, that group is focused on in the next session. The learner is told to continue to practice the relaxation technique in their daily lives. It is not our natural response to relax when there is an external or internal stimulant. However, as in many other physical conditions that we have no control over, the body's best response would be no response at all.
Jacobson trained his patients to voluntarily relax the muscles in their body when ever they are not being used to perform a particular task. He found that the relaxation procedure is effective against a number of ailments including ulcers, insomnia, and hypertension. An entire progressive muscle relaxation protocol can be experienced here.
Jacobson's Progressive Relaxation has remained popular with modern physical therapists.

Bailleur

A bailleur, a French term, is a land owner who outsourced uncultivated parcels of land as part of an early Middle Age share cropping system known as "complant" — a precursor to the métayage system. Under this system, a laborer known as a prendeur would agree to cultivate land owned by the "bailleur" in exchange for ownership of the crop and its production. For use of the "bailleur's" soil, the "prendeur" promised a share (normally a third to two-thirds) of the crop's production or its revenue to the "bailleur". The length of this partnership varied and sometimes would extend over generations.

Emerald Software

Emerald Software was a video game publisher founded in 1988 by two UK entertainment executives - David Martin of Martech, and Mike Dixon who previously worked with EMI and worked as the company CEO.
The company was headquartered in a three-storey Georgian house ("Washington Lodge") in Wilkin Street, Waterford, Ireland.
The company had varying fortunes and failed in 1991, with the few remaining staff having worked without pay for the final few months in an attempt to keep the company going.
The people.
The company was mostly populated by graduates or placement students from the then-named Waterford Regional Technical College - with some from University College Dublin and others with no formal computer training.
At its peak, Emerald Software employed 17 programmers and 5 graphic artists. These people were spread across 5 departments, loosely split to cover each of the supported development platforms and graphic art - with two additional personnel in Administration and Human Resources.
The developers were:
The artists were:
Development.
The company authored games for the Commodore Amiga, IBM PC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC systems.
Development for Amiga and Atari ST games was carried out using Manx C, and Motorola 68000 Assembly language. As both Amiga and ST were 68000 based machines, games were typically authored on the Amiga and then ported using an in-house authored porting / remote-debug / development environment; this allowed the code to be edited on the more capable Amiga, then transmitted to the ST and remotely executed/debugged from the Amiga. The development system was written by Brian Kelly and was based on Lattice C. Graphics and sound routines required re-authoring, but in many cases this was straightforward.
The Amiga games did not run on top of Workbench / AmigaOS - but on a custom-written tiny OS (KOS) with a proprietary disk format which offered higher data capacity per diskette, as well as helping to impede casual copying. This was written by Brian Kelly (the K in KOS).
Development for Spectrum and CPC games took place on a commercially available cross-assembler development environment (PDS) hosted on an IBM PC clone which was electronically connected to a Spectrum. This allowed the game to be authored on the stable PC environment (complete with disk backup), then "blasted" directly into the Spectrum memory to allow for immediate testing. Developing in this manner allowed for significantly higher development speeds than could be achieved by native development on the Spectrum.
As both ZX Spectrum and CPC 464 were Zilog Z80 based machines, CPC versions were usually ported versions of the Spectrum games, with the graphics display on the more-capable CPC reconfigured to be close to that of the more primitive Spectrum. Z80 development was primarily run by Damian Scattergood. The team developed a graphics display system for the CPC 464 that emulated the Spectrum screen layout which meant graphics routines could be ported quickly. Damian also developed his own macro programming language that meant that code could be compiled and shared instantly across both platforms. Z80 development was actually done on a PC where the code could be edited and complied quickly, and then was ported via RS232 direct onto the Spectrum and CPC machines for testing.
List of games.
The company produced a number of games during its brief existence, to somewhat mixed reviews. These were largely ports of existing arcade games ("Vigilante" for example) or original movie tie-ins ("The Running Man") but there were also some original game concepts (e.g. Phantom Fighter):

This Time I Mean It

"This Time I Mean It" was the Danish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999, performed in English (the first time the entry from Denmark had not performed in Danish) by Michael Teschl & Trine Jepsen.
The song was performed in Danish at the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix, titled "Denne gang" ("This time").
The song was performed ninth on the night, following Norway's Van Eijk with "Living My Life Without You" and preceding France's Nayah with "Je veux donner ma voix". At the close of voting, it had received 71 points, placing 8th in a field of 23.
The song is sung from the perspective of two people realising that they are in love with each other "again", and promising that this time they will be better in the relationship than they had been before.
It was succeeded as Danish representative at the 2000 Contest by the Olsen Brothers with "Fly on the Wings of Love".

Use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense

Use of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense is a 2003 report by The MITRE Corporation that documented widespread use of and reliance on free software (termed "FOSS") within the United States Department of Defense (DoD). The report helped end a debate about whether FOSS should be banned from U.S. DoD systems, and helped redirect the discussion towards the current official U.S. DoD policy of treating FOSS and proprietary software as equals.
History.
Version 1.0.
The FOSS report began in early 2002 as a request relayed to Terry Bollinger of The MITRE Corporation to collect data on how FOSS was being used in U.S. DoD systems. The driver for the request was an ongoing debate within the U.S. DoD about whether to ban the use of FOSS in its systems, and in particular whether to ban GNU General Public License (GPL) software. The U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) was also interested, and agreed to sponsor the report. The first draft was completed two weeks later, and version 1.0 was released a few weeks after that. It quickly gained notoriety for its documentation of widespread use of FOSS in the U.S. Department of Defense, and consequently was mentioned in an article about free software in the "Washington Post".
The attention resulted in a new round of reviews and edits. Microsoft Corporation requested that Ira Rubinstein, their legal counsel and liaison for DoD software policy issues, be permitted to participate. Rubinstein, who is listed in the preface as the first reviewer, produced the most detailed critique of the report. His recommendations resulted in a massive expansion of the coverage and analysis of free software licenses.
Version 1.2.
The final report, version 1.2.04, was completed on January 2, 2003. It was first published on the DISA web site, and is now available on the DoD CIO web site on open source software resources.
Impact.
Prior to this report, very little data had been available about how—and even whether—FOSS was used widely in U.S. DoD systems. The report changed this aspect of the discussion immediately, proving beyond any reasonable doubt that the U.S. DoD was already a major user of FOSS. More importantly, the report documented that FOSS was being used in important and even mission-critical situations. One of the more surprising findings documented in the report is that the cyber security community was the most upset of any group at the prospect of FOSS being banned. From their perspective, FOSS provides high code visibility and the ability to fix security flaws quickly and quietly. As a result of the findings, any serious consideration of banning FOSS was dropped. The effort to develop a policy on using FOSS instead moved towards a much more even-handed policy that was initiated with the Stenbit open source software policy, that requires U.S. DoD groups to treat FOSS in the same fashion as proprietary software, and subsequently made even more explicit in the 2009 Wennergren clarification of the Stenbit policy.
The broader impact can be realized by recognizing that if the security-conscious U.S. DoD had banned FOSS, it is likely many other federal components, state and local governments, corporations, and international groups would have followed suit. The result would have been a world much less friendly both to FOSS and to FOSS-like efforts such as Wikipedia.
Findings.
Below is the executive summary of the report. The full report was published in multiple formats, which can be found along with related open source software resources on Bollinger's personal website.

Alexis Sánchez

Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez (; born 19 December 1988) is a Chilean footballer who plays for FC Barcelona in La Liga and the Chilean national team as a forward.
After his debut season of first-team football with Cobreloa, Sánchez was signed by Italy's Udinese Calcio in 2006. After successful loans at Colo-Colo and River Plate, two years later began playing at Serie A. In 2011, he was signed by Barcelona for US$43 million, becoming the most expensive transfer in Chilean football history.
He has been a full international for Chile since 2006, earning over 70 caps and playing in two FIFA World Cups (2010 and 2014) and the 2011 Copa América.
Club career.
Early life and career.
After an impressive season, on 21 April 2006 Sánchez caught the attention of Udinese who bought him for a US$3 million fee. However, Udinese began a maturation project with Alexis and loaned him to Chilean powerhouse Colo-Colo in a season-long deal.
Loan spells.
Alexis' first game for Colo-Colo was on 23 June 2006 in a 1–1 draw with Antofagasta and his first goal came during a "Superclásico" against Universidad de Chile in a 4–2 win played at Estadio Monumental on 29 October. His strong performances allowed him break into the team's starting lineup after successfully challenging Mario Cáceres for the position of striker and began partnering Humberto Suazo in attack. On 1 November, he scored his first brace at Pedreros in a 4–4 draw with Deportes La Serena.
Sánchez won his first professional title in Colo-Colo after earn Torneo Apertura 2006, and also scored his first goal in an international contest after score in the 7–2 thrashing of LD Alajuelense for the Copa Sudamericana (tournament that Colo-Colo failed to win after being defeated by Pachuca at Estadio Nacional).
After the FIFA U-20 World Cup, Sánchez was loaned to River Plate in 2007, winning the league title one year later.
Udinese.
After a successful season in Argentina, Sánchez left South America in July 2008 to officially join Udinese, where he would meet up with Chilean compatriot Mauricio Isla. Sánchez made his non-competitive debut in a 3–0 win over Bassano and was named the man of match. On 14 September, he played his first game in Serie A in a 1–0 loss with Juventus and four days later, he made his European debut against Borussia Dortmund. On 19 October 2008, Sánchez scored his first league goal against Lecce. After this first goal, Sánchez got into a minor slump, in which he took much criticism. The criticism ended after scoring the winning goal in the 90th minute against Bologna in a 1–0 win, being named the man of match.
In the following season, Sánchez played an important role for Udinese in Coppa Italia 2009–10, being a key player in the team that eliminated Milan, assisting Gökhan Inler for the winning goal. In the semi-final second leg, Sánchez was the man of match after playing a successful game against Roma, including scoring his first Coppa Italia goal in the 81st minute. It was not enough, however, as the aggregate score was 2–1 in favor of Roma. By the end of this year, Sánchez scored a total of five goals (four at the end of tournament) in 32 appearances.
On 27 February 2011, Sánchez scored four of seven goals as his team defeated Palermo 7–0, playing only the first 52 minutes of the game. This event meant he broke the record of goals scored by a Chilean player (in a single match) in the Italian Serie A, thus beating the records set by his historic countrymen Marcelo Salas and Iván Zamorano.
During his successful season at Udinese, Sánchez and Italian striker Antonio Di Natale became one of the best scoring duos in Serie A tallying 39 goals between then, two goals short of the Del Piero–Trezeguet duo that completed 41 goals in the 2007–08 season. In recognition of his achievements he was named the world's most promising youngster of the 2011 season, by the users of "FIFA.com", where users had to choose between Sánchez, Gareth Bale, Javier Pastore, Ganso and Neymar in a poll. Sánchez ranked 56th in the May 2011 edition of Castrol Performance Index and 24th among the forwards.
Barcelona.
On 20 July 2011, FC Barcelona confirmed they had agreed a €26 million fee (plus €11.5m in certain bonuses) with Udinese for the transfer of Sánchez, thus becoming the first Chilean to ever play for the club. "Sánchez is very young," said manager Pep Guardiola. "He can play in all three attacking positions, he shows intense defensive skills, he's direct and from what I've been told, he's a very nice kid." The transfer was finalised five days later when he passed a medical and signed a five-year contract. "I want to learn from players like Lionel Messi and Xavi Hernández—and I want to help the club win more titles," said Sánchez.
His debut season for Barcelona was mired with short-term injuries. Sanchez made his debut on 14 August 2011 against arch rivals Real Madrid in the 2012 Supercopa de España first leg away match, and had a thigh injury after a challenge by Marcelo. Barcelona won the tie 5–4 on aggregate. He made his return two weeks later as a substitute in the 2011 UEFA Super Cup, won by Barca 2–0. Alexis then started the opening match of La Liga, at home against Villarreal CF, and scored his first goal in a 5–0 win. A week later, on 10 September 2011, he was stretchered off after 30 minutes following a challenge from Dani Estrada in a La Liga match against Real Sociedad. Sánchez returned on 1 November 2011 in an away match against Viktoria Plzeň. On 10 December 2011, he scored Barcelona's equaliser against Real Madrid in a match they went on to win 1–3.
On 14 February 2012, Sánchez scored the first and second UEFA Champions League goals of his career in Barcelona's 3–1 victory against Bayer 04 Leverkusen. On 2 October he scored the first goal for Barcelona in a 0–2 win against S.L. Benfica.
On 10 February 2013, Sánchez scored his first goal of the 2012–13 La Liga season in Barça's 6–1 home win against Getafe CF. From February onwards, Sánchez scored in matches against Deportivo de La Coruña, Real Mallorca, Athletic Club, Real Betis, Atlético de Madrid and RCD Espanyol to end the season with eight league goals. Barcelona won the league title, ending the season with 100 points.
On 26 October 2013, Sánchez scored the winning goal as Barça beat Real Madrid 2–1 at Camp Nou in the first "Clásico" fixture of the 2013–14 La Liga season. On 5 January 2014, Sánchez scored his first hat-trick for Barcelona in a 4–0 win against Elche CF. He ended the 2013–14 season with a career best 21 goals in all competitions, including 19 in La Liga.
International career.
Sánchez made his international debut for the Chile national team against New Zealand on 27 April 2006. He was called up by the coach José Sulantay to represent the Chilean under-20 team at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup held in Canada, where they finished third.
After his participation in the youth championship, Sánchez scored his first senior international goal in a 2–1 loss against Switzerland on 7 September 2007. He scored three times during "La Roja's" successful 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign and appeared on every match during the tournament finals. He then participated in the 2011 Copa América, scoring once in a 1–1 group stage draw with Uruguay.
Sánchez scored four times in Chile's qualification campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
On 15 November 2013, Sánchez scored both goals as Chile beat England 2–0 at Wembley Stadium, repeating the achievement of national team legend Marcelo Salas in 1998.
On 13 June 2014, Sánchez scored Chile's opening goal of the 2014 World Cup in a 3–1 defeat of Australia in Cuiabá.
During the round of 16, Sánchez scored the equalising goal in a 1–1 draw against the host Brazil. However, he was one of three Chileans to fail to convert their kicks in the penalty shootout, having his shot saved by Júlio César as the "Seleção" prevailed 3–2.

John Jett

John Jett (born November 11, 1968) is a former American football punter in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys and the Detroit Lions. He played college football for East Carolina University. Jett won two Super Bowl rings with the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII and Super Bowl XXX. 
Early years.
Jett attended Northumberland High School where he played football and baseball, receiving All-State honors as a pitcher and outfielder.
Although Jett came to East Carolina University as an unrecruited walk-on athlete, he became a 4-year starter at Punter. He graduated after recording two of the three best single season averages in school history, setting the records for career punting average (40.0) and yards-per-punt average in a season (42.2).
In 2007, he was inducted into the East Carolina Athletics Hall of Fame.
Professional career.
Minnesota Vikings.
Jett was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Minnesota Vikings in 1992 and was released before the start of the season.
Dallas Cowboys.
On March 10, 1993, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys and replaced Mike Saxon on the defending Super Bowl champion. He finished the year with a 41.8 yards gross average, third in the NFC in net punting average (37.7) and led the league in percentage of punts downed inside the 20-yard line (39.3%).
In 1994, he had a gross average of 41.9 yards (sixth in the NFC), led the league in percentage of punts downed inside the 20-yard line (37.1%) and his 26 punts that landed inside the 20-yard line were the third highest ever in franchise history. In the divisional playoff win against the Green Bay Packers, he registered the third best punting performance in Cowboys playoff history, with a 45.8 yard gross average. 
In 1995, he had a gross average of 40.9 yards and a net average of 34.5. After a block, in the NFC Championship Game win against the Green Bay Packers, he went on to average 45.8 yards and tie the mark for the third highest punting average in the franchise postseason history, receiving NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors.
During his time with the team, he led the NFL in punts inside the 20 yard-line for four straight seasons. 
Detroit Lions.
Jett was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Lions in 1997, after the salary cap-strapped Cowboys could not afford to resign him.
He missed three games with a calf injury in 2001. On October 30, 2003, he was placed on the injured reserve list, with what turned out to be a career-ending calf injury.
Personal life.
He currently lives in Northumberland County, Virginia, and has served on the County School Board.

Passport Designs

Passport Designs Inc. was a pioneer in the field of computer music, introducing the pre-MIDI SoundChaser in 1982.
History.
The company was founded in 1979 by David Kusek and John Borowicz, and incorporated in 1980, with Kusek as CEO and Borowicz as Vice-President of Development. They had previously worked together at Electronic Music Labs from 1973–76 and Star Instruments from 1976-79. The company was originally headquartered in Montara, California, moving to Half Moon Bay, California and finally to Foster City, California. An engineering office was also briefly maintained in Minnesota.
Pioneer.
The company was a pioneer in the field of computer music, introducing the pre-MIDI SoundChaser in 1982. This Apple II-based system included the Mountain Computer Music System, a programmable 8-voice wavetable synthesizer that fit in two Apple II slots, the Soundchaser 4-octave keyboard, and system software, written by Kusek, that emulated a four-track tape recorder. After Mountain Computer discontinued the Mountain Computer Music System, Passport developed the Soundchaser MX-5(MX-500) Card to use instead. The MX-5 contains not only Mountain Computer Music System compatible sound function but also MIDI interface and keyboard interface of Sound Chaser Music keyboard in single card. In 1983, composer John Melcher developed 4-Track Editor, a composing application that enabled music to be entered like a word-processor. The same year, Passport released Turbo-Traks, a 16-track version of their recording software. At this time, they also released Notewriter, a "real-time monophonic music transcriber", and Notetools, an add-on to convert Notewriter files to 4-Track Performance files. They also released a series of educational applications, written by Dr. Charles Brody.
MIDI.
When the first MIDI specification was adopted in 1983, Passport put all of its development resources in this direction, licensing and developing a MIDI interface from Rittor Music in Japan and hiring Melcher to develop MIDI recording software. Composer Phil Stone was also hired at this time, first to develop audio for games on the Commodore 64, and then to port MIDI applications from Apple II to Commodore. 
The first of these were MIDI/2 and MIDI/4, two-track and four-track MIDI sequencer/recorders for Apple II and Commodore 64 platforms, including OEM versions of MIDI/4 for Yamaha and Korg. These were introduced at the 1984 National Association of Music Manufacturers (NAMM) trade show, the first commercially-available MIDI sequeners in the United States. These were followed by Master Tracks in 1985, and Master Tracks Pro in 1986. This software pushed the Apple II to its limits, working with an optional card to extend the Apple's memory from 48K to 2M. In 1987, after Melcher left Passport, Master Tracks Pro was completely rewritten for the Apple Macintosh, and later the Atari ST series computers, and still exists for Windows and Apple O/Ses.
By this time, Passport Designs was attracting nationwide media attention for their products. An article in the May 28, 1984 issue of Newsweek described the upcoming MIDISOFT conference of music software publishers, and featured a photograph of Passport's demo room with a bank of MIDI-controlled synthesizers.
Other applications.
PolyWriter, Passport's first music notation application, was released in 1984, followed by Encore, a professional music notation application capable of creating high-quality scores. The Encore feature set was adapted to different markets and sold as Rhapsody, MusicTime and MusicTime Deluxe. There was also a version called music@Passport, an attempt to integrate web-based music publishing into a desktop notation editor.
Memphis was a guitar tablature creation application that offered an easy to use drag-and-drop interface that enabled the user to create and print easy-to-read tabs.
Alchemy was a waveform audio editor, originally developed by Blank Software and subsequently purchased by Passport, that integrated Macintosh computers with most current digital sampler brands that supported the MIDI Sample Dump Standard, including Akai, Casio, E-mu, Ensoniq, Korg, Kurzweil, Peavey and Roland. Later versions allowed users to create a sound library that could be shared those sounds across multiple sampler formats. The final version, version 3.0, was released in 1996.
Shifting focus from music software to the nascent "multimedia" market, they introduced Passport Producer in 1992, and Producer Pro 1.0 in 1994.
Sale of the company.
Competition from Macromind/MacroMedia Director, coupled with the atrophying of the core music product line, led to the sale of some of the company assets to GVOX in 1998, when Passport Designs ceased to exist as a company. In the latter half of 2013, GVOX sold off its software interests to Passport Music Software, LLC.
